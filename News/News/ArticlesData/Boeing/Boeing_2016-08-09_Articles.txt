(MIke Siegel/The Seattle Times) Boeing will decide in the next couple of months whether to further cut back planned production of its large 777 jet and may also cancel a planned production increase for the 787 Dreamliner. Share story By Dominic Gates Seattle Times aerospace reporter Citing “softness” in the widebody-jet market, Boeing Chief Financial Officer Greg Smith said Wednesday that the airplane manufacturer will decide in the next couple months whether to further cut back planned production of its large 777 jet. Smith indicated that the dearth of widebody-jet sales may also mean Boeing won’t raise output of the 787 Dreamliner as high as planned.   Coming on the heels of last month’s signal that Boeing could shutter the 747 jumbo-jet assembly line, the latest wavering on production means Boeing’s Everett plant could lose substantial work that would trigger significant job cuts. Jon Talton's column Back to the future: a new Boeing recession? Boeing has already shed more than 3,500 jobs in Washington state so far this year, with more to come due to previously announced cost-cutting efforts. John Monroe, a former 777 executive at Boeing and now chief operations officer at the Economic Alliance of Snohomish County (EASC), said the Everett community would feel the impact of a Boeing downcycle at a plant that currently employs about 37,000 people. He said a dip in Boeing work would also hit many suppliers to the jet maker around Everett. “Our experience has been that significant production-rate cuts have been followed by reductions in the workforce,” Monroe said. “Job cuts seem inevitable.” Boeing has already committed to slowing production of the current 777 from today’s rate of 8.3 jets per month — that’s 100 per year — down to 7 jets per month in 2017. The rate will decrease further to 5.5 jets per month during the transition to the new model 777X in 2018. Speaking at the Jefferies Industrials Conference in New York, Smith said it’s unclear if new orders will arrive in time to match those planned production rates. “Over the next couple of months, we’ll know,” Smith said. “We’ll either solidify those orders … or we’ll modify the production rate.” Boeing has said it needs to sell 40 to 60 jets per year to fill all the open 777 delivery slots between now and the end of the decade. So far this year, it has booked just eight net new orders. Smith did not indicate how much lower the rate might go. Local aviation analyst Scott Hamilton of Leeham.net said the 777 order backlog suggests a rate of about 4 aircraft per month is sustainable without further sales. One indicator that the 777 market is in trouble came in a regulatory filing late last month by global aircraft lessor Intrepid Aviation. Intrepid, which has six 777s on order from Boeing, revealed it hasn’t yet found airlines to take four of those planes — three scheduled for delivery in fall next year and the fourth in early 2018. Sam Pearlstein, aerospace analyst with Wells Fargo, wrote in a note to investors that, “This highlights why Boeing’s goal of 40-plus annual new 777 orders will remain a challenge.” On Wednesday, Smith also lowered expectations on production of the 787 Dreamliner. Boeing is now producing 12 of the jets per month and planned to raise that to 14 per month by the end of the decade. Now that rate hike looks uncertain. “We’re going to match supply and demand, and if it doesn’t play out to be 14, then we’ll adjust accordingly,” Smith said. “It’s not the end of the world if you went from 14 to 12 … We can still be profitable.” While the 787 sold at record levels before entering service, sales slowed dramatically afterward. In the first five years of sales, Boeing sold 700 Dreamliners. In the five and a half years since, it has sold 400 more. So far this year, Boeing has added just 19 net new orders for the jet. Last week, Leeham.net’s Hamilton wrote that even the current rate of 12 Dreamliners per month could be challenging to sustain without an uptick in 787 sales. In an interview Wednesday, Hamilton said that if 787 production is further pared back, it’s likely the cutbacks will come in Everett rather than at the assembly line in North Charleston, S.C. The South Carolina line’s prospects are bolstered by the fact that Boeing will build the largest Dreamliner model, the 787-10, only at that plant. If the 787 rate were cut, along with the possibility of a 777 production cut and the 747 line closing, “By the end of the decade, it’s very possible we could be looking at some lean times in Everett,” Hamilton said. And he warned that the new 777 model in development, the 777X, doesn’t have enough sales to suggest a big recovery when it enters service in 2020. Boeing, which has 306 firm orders for that new jet, has booked no new orders within the past year. Hamilton said that’s only enough to sustain a production rate of four or five a month. “The 777X isn’t going to be any kind of savior,” he said. Hamilton said Washington state officials need to do “a deep dive into the potential scenarios” and come up with a proactive plan to capture new work for Everett — whether that’s Boeing’s next new airplane or aerospace work from other companies. Monroe said his economic- development group is talking to various European companies, both aerospace and non-aerospace, about locating new facilities in Snohomish County and will continue to push an economic-diversification strategy. He said the state should also step up the funding of worker-retraining programs. Over the past couple of years, as Boeing has shed jobs in Washington state, its local unions have ratcheted up the pressure on state legislators to make the company accountable for maintaining jobs here, by linking the state’s aerospace tax incentives to employment levels. Yet as further job losses now loom, Monroe argued for the opposite approach to keep as much Boeing work here as possible. He said state legislators “need to avoid any reductions in the tax incentives programs that could adversely affect Boeing.” Jon Holden, president of the International Association of Machinists (IAM) district 751, said the union has “great concern” over any job losses. He said that in the event of a real industry downturn, the IAM is prepared to discuss how to handle tax incentives — implying that Boeing needn’t be penalized if job cuts are the result of an industry downcycle beyond its control. But since the previous peak employment in fall 2012, Boeing has shed 11,000 jobs in Washington state, and Holden said this was a period of record production, when Boeing chose to move thousands of jobs to other states. “If there is no accountability (by Boeing), we’ll continue to see infrastructure, capability and capacity created elsewhere,” Holden said. “Even in a downturn, we should protect the infrastructure here so that when there’s an upswing, that upswing will happen in our state.” Smith meanwhile told his Wall Street audience Wednesday that even if the potential cuts he discussed do happen, the company’s cash flow will stay healthy — thanks largely to planned increases in production of the single-aisle 737 jet built in Renton. “You are still going to see growing cash flows going forward,” Smith assured investors. “That is ultimately what matters.” Dominic Gates: 206-464-2963 or dgates@seattletimes.com Email Newsletter Sign-up Custom-curated news highlights, delivered weekday mornings.

Which explains those massive planes in Columbus Antonov An-124-100 Ruslan Volga-Dnepr Airlines at ILA 2014 Berlin Air Show RA-82078 Print Email Stephen Koff, cleveland.com By Stephen Koff, cleveland.com The Plain Dealer Follow on Twitter on August 10, 2016 at 11:01 AM, updated August 10, 2016 at 1:21 PM comments WASHINGTON, D.C. -- While the country debated whether Russia was trying to mess with America's presidential election, a massive Russian cargo jet landed in Columbus late last week. The Volga-Dnepr plane is a behemoth, bigger that any cargo aircraft operated by a United States carrier. It had just received special permission from the United States government to pick up a load of five General Electric jet engines -- made in southwest Ohio -- and ferry them to Everett, Washington, to be mounted on new Boeing 787 jetliners. Boeing needed the engines right then, G.E. told the government, saying work on a Boeing production line in Washington had stopped because of delivery delays. Unless you were driving by Rickenbacker International Airport in Ohio's capital on Friday, you had no idea a colossal Russian cargo airline, capable of loading from the front (with its nose flipped up as if on a hinge) and the back, was doing this. Meantime, newspaper columnists, online pundits and the campaigns of Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump were debating about Russia, Russian Federation President Vladimir Putin, the role his country played in hacking Democratic National Party emails and the use of WikiLeaks to expose the Russian-hacked emails to the world. Russia, went the narrative, should be viewed with suspicion. But guess what, America?  A Russian company has become our Uber for oversize, point-to-point cargo delivery within the United States, exempt or immune from all the geopolitical turmoil and talk. It carries oversize jet parts, components for America's electric infrastructure, parts that propel U.S. satellites into space.  "They even haul things for the U.S. military," said A. Oakley Brooks, president and CEO of the National Air Carriers Association, which presents American cargo companies. Even in times of tension, such as when the White House and Congress were warning Putin not to invade Ukraine, the flights continued unabated. "As a matter of policy, the U.S. has been good about not intertwining aviation with issues of the day," said Robert Silverberg, a Washington, D.C.-based attorney for ABX Air, a Wilmington, Ohio cargo carrier that hauls smaller loads than the Russians carry. Here, based on a cleveland.com review of government records, is how and why the United States relies on this Russian company and a competing Ukrainian firm. They can do it and we can't: American companies rely on the privately owned Volga-Dnepr and its competitor, Antonov Airlines, a state-owned Ukrainian enterprise, because the companies own or lease the world's largest commercial cargo jets and American air carriers don't. The plane of choice is made by a different division of the Antonov industrial enterprise: an Antonov 124 that specializes in heavy and oversize cargo. It's so big and so easy to load that it can fit large parts of other aircraft, including multiple engines and wing assemblies, in its interior. A boast from Antonov on the plane:  "The list of its cargo is endless – in this sense it can be called as the most universal airplane in the whole history of aviation." No domestic carrier in the United States has such a plane. "It's strictly a function of there being no other equivalent aircraft in the U.S.," Silverberg said. For the record, Antonov has an even larger plane -- the world's biggest -- but it seldom flies. Demand hasn't justified building one here: The irony that America's leading aircraft and aerospace companies rely on Russian and Ukrainian companies for their largest interstate deliveries is lost on no one. It is even richer that Boeing, based on Chicago and with extensive manufacturing facilities in Washington state, contracts to make a somewhat smaller cargo jet, the Boeing 747-8, for Volga-Dnepr but not for American airlines.  Two factors make this reasonable: American airlines, including cargo haulers, no longer want the 747, a four-engine jumbo jet that American carriers believe has been eclipsed by newer, more efficient models. Were it not for demand by Volga-Dnepr for new Boeing 747's, the 747 production line might be nearing its end, Bloomberg reported when writing about the latest Volga-Dnepr jet orders. The 747 is big, but the Antonov 124 aircraft is bigger and easier to load. That's why G.E. contracts with Volga-Dnepr and Antonov Airlines to send a giant Antonov-made jet to Columbus every so often to fetch its engines and send them to Boeing -- rather than using a domestic freight airline that uses Boeing-made jets. The market for an extraordinarily big aircraft certainly seems to exist; federal government records show requests are made within the United States every month, and sometimes more often, to hire the Russian company and one of its planes. But demand may not be strong enough to actually build and base one here. Frank Avent, a South Carolinian who runs Airline Information Research, tracking airline industry documents, said domestic carriers have asked Boeing to build a bigger plane, but Boeing balks, and Boeing is "the only game in town for that." "They don't think there's demand," Avent said. Boeing has declined to comment. The U.S. government says this is fine: Federal aviation law normally would ban foreign carriers from offering domestic-only flights. This protects the market for United States airlines. But Volga-Dnepr and Antonov Airlines can apply to the U.S. Department of Transportation for permission on a flight-by-flight basis if they can show they are needed to handle an emergency. The emergencies never seem to stop. How do they define an emergency? They say that a cargo load is ready to go from Point A to Point B in the United States, that over-land delivery is not feasible, and delays are causing a problem. The application must say that no domestic airline is available or can take a load so big. And the foreign carriers must notify domestic cargo carriers so they have a chance to object. American freight airlines object sometimes, said Brooks, of the National Air Carriers Association. "These things are looked at hard by the American carriers, trying to preserve what business they have," he said. Yet U.S. Department of Transportation records show objections are the exception. In fact, the Russian or Ukraine air carrier will file an emergency application one day and routinely get permission the next, for a flight to follow almost immediately. A U.S.-based attorney for one of the overseas cargo carriers disputed that this is a phony emergency. He would not speak for attribution but said that factory production lines rely on just-in-time delivery. The alternatives to requesting an immediate emergency flight -- either scheduling a giant cargo jet without knowing exactly what day it will be needed and then keeping it idle, or else delaying delivery -- would be untenable in billion-dollar industries. The companies make frequent flights -- including for the U.S. space program: Federal regulatory filings show how frequently the giant jets carry American goods from one U.S. city to another. The recent docket for Volga-Dnepr, the Russian company: Aug. 5: Delivery of G.E. jet engines from Columbus to Everett, Washington, for the manufacture of Boeing aircraft. July 27: Delivery of a Boeing 767 wing box and spare parts from West Palm Beach, Florida, to Everett, Washington, for Boeing. May 17: Delivery of five G.E. engines from Columbus to Seattle for Boeing. May 12: Delivery of two G.E. engines from Columbus to Seattle. April 1: Delivery of five Boeing B787 thrust reversers from Yuma, Arizona, to Charleston, South Carolina. Last December, Volga-Dnepr delivered an Atlas V rocket booster from Huntsville, Alabama, to the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida on behalf of the United Launch Alliance. The month before, the cargo was an Atlas V booster tank, carried by the Russians from Huntsville, Alabama, to Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. The launch alliance puts U.S. government satellites, including those for military and intelligence reconnaissance, into space and helps support the International Space Station. It's a joint project of Boeing and Lockheed Martin, and its reliance on the Russians to ferry its largest rocket parts within the United States is routine. Last September, the Russian air carrier picked up a combustion turbine rotor in Charlotte, North Carolina, for delivery to EcoEléctrica, a utility in Puerto Rico.  Said the emergency application to the Department of Transportation: Urgent lift was necessary "because EcoEléctrica produces 16 percent of the island's electricity and the rotor is of extraordinary importance for the operation of EcoEléctrica's power plant and thus to the economy of Puerto Rico."  In other words, Russian help was needed for the U.S. territory. The U.S. government stamped its approval almost immediately.

Photographer:AP Don Bateman’s terrain mapping device has nearly eliminated the largest cause of death in jetliner accidents. By Alan Levin | August 10, 2016 Giant flocks of black birds circled the wreckage of an airliner that had struck an Alaska mountain two weeks earlier, killing all 111 aboard. In a small plane overhead, a young engineer directed his pilot to follow the same path the jet had taken toward the craggy terrain. With seconds to spare, an alarm went off. Don Bateman’s plane climbed to safety, but he was frustrated. The electronic device he invented to warn pilots that they were about to hit the ground didn’t leave enough time to have prevented the large airliner from crashing. “I was disappointed,” Bateman, now 84, recalled of the day in 1971 when he flew over the remains of Alaska Airlines Flight 1866, which had slammed into a fog-shrouded ridge. “We needed to do better.” That’s exactly what Bateman and his small team of engineers at what is now Honeywell International Inc. did. The device presaged today’s mobile mapping applications, dramatically reduced what had been by far the worst class of air crashes and made Honeywell billions of dollars. Don Bateman with a Honeywell plane the company used to test his safety devices at Paine Field in Everett, Wash. Photographer: Mike Kane/Bloomberg “I would give Don individual credit for having saved more lives than any other individual in the history of commercial aviation,” said Earl Weener, a member of the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board and former chief engineer for safety at Boeing Co. Before retiring in June, Bateman and his band of colleagues dabbled in the world of Cold War espionage, hid the true cost of their endeavor from their corporate masters and endured skepticism from the very airlines whose planes were being lost. In spite of repeated changes in corporate ownership and the blunt-spoken Bateman’s occasional threats to quit, he worked on his mission to save lives with the same group for almost six decades, colleagues said. Eventually Bateman’s Enhanced Ground Proximity Warning System became required in most commercial planes around the world, dramatically reducing accidents in which perfectly good aircraft with trained crews plowed into the ground or bodies of water, almost always in poor visibility. In the 1960s and 1970s, there was an average of one such fatal accident per month, according to the AviationSafetyNetwork website. It was by far the largest cause of death in jetliner accidents. President Obama awards Bateman the National Medal of Technology and Innovation in 2011. Photographer: Win McNamee/Getty Images Since the U.S. government began requiring an upgraded version of the device on all but the smallest aircraft starting in 2001, there hasn’t been a single such fatal crash on a U.S. commercial passenger plane equipped with it or competing devices. There have been a few overseas, often when pilots ignored or shut off the devices. President Barack Obama awarded Bateman the National Medal of Technology and Innovation in 2011. Bateman was always fascinated with airplane crashes. As an 8-year-old school boy in 1940 in Saskatoon, Canada, he and a friend sneaked out of class after two military planes collided and crashed nearby. As punishment, his teacher made him write a report on what happened. “That was my introduction to aircraft accidents,” he said recently. The carnage he saw that day helped motivate him years later. After taking a job with Boeing in Seattle, he joined a small aviation firm called United Control in 1958. Airplane accidents continued to fascinate him and he began “making little books” of notes on them. One type stood out. In the arcane world of aviation terminology, these crashes were called Controlled Flight into Terrain, or CFIT. It was a vexing problem: Basic navigation should have kept pilots from crashing. But the cockpit navigation technology of that era wasn’t intuitive and it was too easy to get disoriented, especially at night or in bad weather. “In my mind it became a big issue, even though there wasn’t much being done about it,” Bateman recalled. In the 1960s, Bateman worked with Scandinavian Airlines System, now SAS AB, which had suffered a CFIT crash in Turkey in 1960, to invent a mechanism to warn pilots when they flew too low. It involved a new instrument on planes that used radio waves to determine a plane’s distance from the ground. It helped stem the accident rate and, after a series of crashes, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration required it starting in 1974. But it was prone to false alarms and had a glaring weakness: It couldn’t look forward, so was of little use if a plane was flying toward steeply increasing ground, such as a mountain. For years, Bateman tinkered with the device to improve it. He also consulted with NTSB investigators, poring over accident reports. “He would come to me and say what do we know about this accident?” said Jim Ritter, director of the NTSB’s Office of Research and Engineering, who was a technician at the time. “The whole time, the gears were spinning and he was trying to make things safer.” Bateman had been imagining a far better solution as early as his flight over the Alaska crash site. If he could create a database of all the world’s terrain, the device would see mountain tops and cliffs from miles away. But this was before personal computers and global-positioning services. Even worse, much of the world’s topography was considered secret at the time, a vestige of the Cold War. Then in 1991, in the chaos created by the breakup of the Soviet Union, the detailed maps it had created of the world starting in the 1920s were for sale -- if you knew where to buy them. Bateman asked Frank Daly, the director of engineering at the Sundstrand Corp. division that had swallowed United Control, for his blessing to purchase the data from the U.S. government’s Cold War enemy. “He thought I was crazy,” Bateman said. They wound up sending one of his employees, Frank Brem, in search of maps in Russia and elsewhere. “There isn’t a terrain data store in downtown Moscow,” Daly recalled. “But he would go out and find the right people.” A bigger problem than navigating the black market was the millions of dollars it was costing for the still unproven technology. “We probably weren’t as open with senior management about that process,” Daly said. He sometimes hid costs in other accounts. A demonstration of a prototype infrared technology from Honeywell at Morristown Airport in New Jersey in 2010. Photographer: Emile Wamsteker/Bloomberg By the early 1990s, Bateman had developed working prototypes of the new system. Now the company had to sell it. For pilots and safety officers, it was a marvel. Ed Soliday, then director of safety at United Airlines, had been prodding Bateman to improve the warning device. One day in the early 1990s, Bateman called and said he thought he had what Soliday wanted. “Once I flew the thing with Don, it was like an epiphany,” Soliday recalled. “I was sold. I thought if we could make it work, this was a huge breakthrough.” If a plane was flying toward a mountain, a screen popped up automatically marking the high ground in yellow and red on a map. If pilots didn’t respond, it began a series of increasingly dire warnings. Once a collision became almost imminent, a mechanical voice implored, “Terrain, terrain. Pull up! Pull up!” Compared to the earlier system, it was almost fool proof. There are 45,000 units on aircraft today, worth more than $4 billion at list prices But many of the more cost-conscious corporate chieftains at airlines weren’t convinced, according to Bateman and Daly. A meeting at American Airlines was particularly grim. Daly was on the sales call at the airline’s headquarters with his then chief executive officer. Their host, a senior executive at the airline, was hostile. “He was almost apoplectic and said, ‘We don’t want another box. We don’t want to have to replace the existing system,’ ” Daly said. “Here I am justifying spending tens or hundreds of millions of dollars and my boss has just been soundly beaten on the shoulders by the customer.” Soliday had more success at United. The airline agreed to help Bateman’s team test it so it could be certified by the FAA, he said. Most other carriers balked. It took another high-profile fatal crash to change their minds. What the Pilot Sees The current version of Bateman’s device, Honeywell International Inc.’s Enhanced Ground Proximity Warning System, uses a color-coded map display to show pilots where dangerous high ground lurks ahead. Hazards grow in danger from yellow to red. A solid red area means a collision will occur within 30 seconds if pilots don't act. The device also has warning horns and can instruct pilots to “pull up!” in an emergency. As American Flight 965 neared Cali, Colombia, from Miami on the evening of Dec. 20, 1995, a pilot accidentally entered the wrong data into the plane’s flight computers. The crew didn’t notice as it began a slow left turn toward mountains lying invisible in the darkness. The Boeing 757 was equipped with the earlier version of Bateman’s warning device and its mechanical voice began warning of “terrain.” But 13 seconds later, after the pilots added full throttle to climb as steeply as possible, it rammed into a ridge. All but four of the 163 people aboard died. Within days the airline wanted the new device, which would have issued an alert far earlier and likely prevented the crash, Bateman and Daly said. First American and then United agreed to voluntarily install them. Other carriers followed. The FAA began requiring them in 2001. In the end, the products spawned by Bateman’s device were a financial boon to Honeywell. There are 45,000 units on aircraft today, worth more than $4 billion at list prices, according to the company. Both Bateman and Daly wonder whether the decades-long effort to develop and improve the warning system would be possible in today’s risk-averse corporate world. “Today new projects need to be blessed by many people,” Daly said. “You need to have hard evidence. They just would not speculatively fund something like this, especially when we were being resisted by the aircraft manufacturers, the airlines. “But Don’s faith, the genius of his team and a little support from the company -- and it happened.” Editors: Jon Morgan, Elizabeth Wasserman

Aug 10th 2016, 2:28 PM 40,293 Views 36 Comments Share1489 Tweet Email5 David (right) with the Boeing 767 Image: Quirky Nights Glamping Village DAVID MCGOWAN MADE headlines in May when he and a team of people transported a Boeing 767 plane from Shannon Airport to his glamping site in Co Sligo. The undertaker now has his sights set on a train … and a helicopter. Speaking to the Anton Savage Show on Today FM, McGowan said 40,000 people have visited the glamping site in Enniscrone since the plane landed. “Enniscrone is booming and that’s what we set out to do,” McGowan said. He said nine couples have asked if they can get married on the plane, and a band has asked to record a video on it. “We won’t refuse any business. Don’t worry, we’ll cater for them.” McGowan is now finalising the logistics of bringing a train from London, which he bought for €25,000, to the site. The logistics to move this will be nearly as big as the plane. I rang Irish Ferries yesterday morning and do you know what he said to me? ‘I’ve been waiting for your call. Are you the plane man? We’ve been following you for the last six months.’ “We’ll have to bring her by water I suppose. We’ll have to bring her into Dublin. She’s 63 foot long. The carriages, they’re 40 tonnes. The engine one I thought was 40 tonnes but it’s 50 tonnes, we weighed her.” McGowan is hoping to put tracks on a low loader to transport the train via the Port Tunnel. If this doesn’t work out, McGowan said: “Oh she’d have to come over O’Connell Bridge, she’d be some sight coming over there. But if we have to do it we’ll do it.” Posted by on Wednesday, 23 November 2016 Continuing with the transport theme on the site, McGowan also hopes to include a helicopter. I’m after finding a helicopter … Do you know where I found it? Above in a hay shed in Mullingar. And she’s 40 foot long, right … I’ll get a double bed into it no problem. “And wait ’til you hear the best one – she was en route to a museum. She was leaving this country ‘til I got wind of it.” McGowan said he has convinced the owner to sell the helicopter, which was once part of the Royal Air Force, to him.

The habitats are all orbital, space or deep space based, and are not meant to be used on a surface of a planet or a moon. Nasa is investing $65 million initially (Approximately Rs 433 Crore), with more investment planned further down the line. The companies that Nasa has partnered with are expected to bear 30 per cent of the cost. The companies are Bigelow Aerospace of Las Vegas, Boeing from Pasadena in Texas, Lockheed Martin of Denver, Orbital ATK of Dulles in Virginia, Sierra Nevada Corporation’s Space Systems of Louisville in Colorado and NanoRacks of Webster in Texas. Bigelow Aerospace: Bigelow Aerospace will develop the Expandable Bigelow Advanced Station Enhancement (XBASE). The Xbase is an expandable habitat that is meant to be attached as a visiting module to existing space stations. The module will use technologies and techniques learnt after the recent successful deployment of the Bigelow Expandable Activity Module (BEAM)  at the ISS. the modules can potentially be used for stations in low earth orbit as well as deep space. The Xbase is being tested for commercial uses in the low earth orbit usage scenario. Multiple capsules of these kind can be strung together. The Xbase habitat is 330 cubic meters. The Xbase will be based on Bigelow’s B330 module, which is being developed for research purposes, space manufacturing projects, missions to Mars or the Moon, and even Space Hotels. Two Bigellow B330 modules strung together. Credit: Bigelow Aerospace Boeing: Boeing is developing a modular habitat that is designed to be assembled in orbit. The capsule will be used to assess how humans can live and work in space for extended periods of time. The full scale prototype will be used to test interface standards, system functionality and critical technologies. The habitats are low cost, and very simple. They can be modified for deep space use in long term missions. The full sized module will act as a high fidelity test bed for routine functions of both crew and technologies. Boeing will be leveraging its experience in designing, building and maintaining the International Space Station for fifteen years for developing this modular habitat.

The Orion spacecraft is meant for resupplying the International Space Station, and ferrying crew to and from it. The Orion spacecraft is also designed for longer duration missions, including any potential Mars missions. The supply module from Lockheed Martin can be used for ferrying crew and equipment to any potential deep space habitats. The main component within the multi-purpose logistics module is the Environmental Control and Life Support System (ECLSS). The logistics module is also expected to provide communication support to the Orion spacecraft, as well as deep space habitats. Concept of Lockheed Martin’s NextSTEP-2 habitat with Orion. Credit: Lockheed Martin Orbital ATK: Orbital ATK makes the cargo supply ships for the International Space Station in the form of the Cygnus Spacecraft. The Cygnus Spacecraft will be the basis of the new prototype that Orbital ATK will develop, to be used in tandem with the Orion Spacecraft and other deep space modules. The interfaces between these modules will be tested. The cargo supply spacecraft derived design will be modified and tested for deep space exploration. It will also be modified to accommodate human spacefarers. The prototype will be used to come up with a road map that will lead to a long term mission to Mars. Concept of Orbital ATK’s cislunar Habitat based on Cygnus Credit: Orbital ATK Sierra Nevada Corporation’s Space Systems: Sierra Nevada Corporation’s Space Systems is also a cargo resupplier to the International Space Station. Both pressurised and unpressurised cargo is ferried in modules on board the Dream Chaser spaceplane. This is basically an unmanned reusable space vehicle. The habitat is based on the cargo module used for the ISS resupply. This habitat is being fine tuned to work with inflatable habitats simlar to the one being prototyped by Bigelow Aerospace, as well as the ECLSS module from Lockheed Martin. One of the objectives of the prototype is to make sure all the critical sub systems work seamlessly when assembled together. This habitat has a modular design. The key technology being tested is building a long term space habitat over three or four consecutive launches. Sierra Nevada Corporation’s habitat module concept based on its cargo module. Credit: Sierra Nevada Corporation NanoRacks: This habitat is being developed by NanoRacks with a partnership with two other companies, Space Systems Loral and United Launch Alliance. The efforts are combined under the name “Ixion.” This is a cutting edge attempt at some outer space jugaad. The attempt is a feasibility study, to check how to re-purpose the propellant tanks of existing launch vehicles, into a habitat that can be occupied by humans. The propellant segment is called an upper stage in launch vehicles, and this is usually discarded after the propellant is used up to launch the vehicle. This is a cost saving measure, if it works, and can be used with many rocket systems. Concept of re-purposing the propellant segment into a habitat. Credit: NanoRacks If you have been noticing the moon on the edges of the images, then that is the region that Nasa wants to dominate in the next stage of the space race. The idea is to explore outward from the low earth orbit of the International Space Station, to the region covered by the orbit of the moon around the earth. This region is called cislunar space. All the habitats that Nasa is developing is designed for cislunar space as well as any eventual explorations towards Mars.

An extensive underwater hunt in the southern Indian Ocean has not yet found the crash site, fueling speculation it may be outside the current search zone, particularly if someone was at the controls at the end of the flight. A manned plane could have been glided down, allowing it to enter the water outside the 120,000 square kilometer (46,000 square mile) area being searched, some experts have suggested. But extensive testing by aircraft manufacturer Boeing and new Australian defense department data analysis both suggest that — regardless of the possible actions of one or both of the pilots — the jet dived into the ocean at high speed, The Australian reported. Once MH370 ran out of fuel and the engines flamed, it slowed before plunging down towards the water in a series of swoops — dropping from 35,000 feet at a rate of between 12,000 feet a minute and 20,000 feet a minute, Boeing said, according to the report. The sharp dive was confirmed by a new data analysis by Australia's defence department involving signals sent automatically between the plane and a satellite, the head of the agency leading the MH370 hunt said. Australian Transport and Safety Bureau chief Greg Hood said this supported the view MH370 “was likely to have crashed in the 120,000 square kilometer (46,000 square mile) area now being searched,” the paper said. The area was defined under the ATSB's “most likely” scenario that no-one was at the controls and the plane ran out of fuel. “The Australians leading the search do not doubt that the pilot may well have been responsible for the jet's disappearance but they say critics of the search strategy are wrong to assume that means they are looking in the wrong place,” the report added. Malaysian officials said last week that one of the pilots used a home-made flight simulator to plot a very similar course to MH370's presumed final route, but warned this did not prove he deliberately crashed the plane.

As intern Edwin Mercado-Colon sat at a computer typing commands, the drone began to move around the room and an unmanned vehicle automatically followed.  But Mercado-Colon wasn’t using a controller to direct the drone. Instead, he picked a destination for the drone without telling it how to get there. “He’s picking a spot in the lab to fly to,” said Mike Abraham, manager of Boeing’s Collaborative Autonomous Systems Laboratory. “That command goes to the vehicle. The vehicle knows where it is because of the motion capture system. It’s determining how to get to the next point, on its own.” Developing unmanned vehicles that can work together on their own represents the latest in drone technology, a global industry that analysts predict could be worth $127 billion by 2020. Listen Listening... / 3:43 St. Louis Public Radio's Eli Chen explains Boeing's role in the developing drones that can communicate with each other. Boeing is among the leaders in such research, testing collaborative drones in its new laboratory, an 81,000-square-foot warehouse where the company tests the ability of drones developed by universities and businesses. In the near future, drones could handle such complicated tasks as surveying natural disasters or conducting search and rescue missions. Although unmanned vehicles already can help people perform such jobs, military and business leaders hope drones will one day communicate with other machines to accomplish such missions more effectively. At Boeing’s new facility, researchers are testing systems that could help make that possible. The new laboratory looks like a film set, with a system of motion-capturing cameras that lets a drone know its exact position in the room. “It’s the same technology they use in the movie industry,” Abraham said. Engineers at the laboratory recently conducted an experiment where an unmanned air vehicle and an unmanned ground vehicle had to communicate together to resolve a disaster. In the simulation, the machines had to work together to shut off a makeshift gas valve. The air vehicle scanned the area for a usable path to reach the valve and sent directions to the ground vehicle. “In collaborating with the air vehicle and the ground vehicle, you kept people safe by not having people in that dangerous situation,” Abraham said. “Between the two vehicles, you are more able to accomplish the task.” Research has shown that using multiple drones is more effective and efficient than using one. For example, a 2014 study conducted by the RAND Corporation found that, in a “hunter-killer mission,” a remotely piloted unmanned aircraft could track a target well. A group of drones performed better than one drone, even though the sole vehicle had more sophisticated features. “For the main part of the mission, the difficulty was in locating the target,” said Lance Menthe, the study’s lead author. “In that case, having multiple points of view was as good as having one large eye.” The Air Force commissioned that study to learn how to make drones more cost-effective and more advanced than the ones used so far in Iraq and Afghanistan. If teams of drones could be programmed to carry out missions on their own, the armed services would need fewer people to monitor them. “For some of our military customers, we want them to get more and more automated where vehicles are pretty much reacting by themselves and then informing everyone else what they’re doing,” Abraham said. Additionally, autonomy can improve safety, particularly so that one vehicle does not accidentally collide into another. “You don’t want to wait for a human operator to say, ‘yes, avoid that other aircraft,’” Abraham said. However, challenges remain in developing such technology. Maintaining communication between a group of drones, for instance, isn’t easy, Menthe said. Any number of things can cause lapses in communication between two devices, similar to how cell phones often drop calls. Also, placing trust in a team of drones that can operate on their own presents an ethical dilemma that’s worthy of science fiction literature. “Generally speaking, we don’t like them to be able to shoot on their own,” Menthe said, thinking of the artificial intelligence in the “Terminator” movies. “I mean, nobody wants to create Skynet.” For Menthe, what’s more important than making sure two drones can talk to each other is ensuring that human handlers maintain control over the technology. The algorithms being tested at Boeing’s new laboratory are critical in developing faith that the machines will perform as intended. “[Getting] the technologies to talk back and forth between the aircraft is only half the puzzle,” Menthe said. “The other half is making sure that you’ve got the people who are piloting or working with the data able to give the right commands. It’s a human-computer team.” Tags:  Unmanned Drones Boeing Robotics Top Stories Audio Features TweetShareGoogle+Email View the discussion thread.

All passengers and crew escaped from the Boeing Co. 777-300 following the 12:45 p.m. explosion on Flight 521 from Thiruvananthapuram, India. A firefighter was killed trying to extinguish the blaze, Emirates Chairman Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum said at an evening news conference in Dubai. The trouble with the flight was “operational,” he said, adding he didn’t believe there was any security issue. The pilot might have attempted a so-called go-around – that is, aborting the landing – to avoid wind shear, but that hadn’t been verified, Sheikh Ahmed said. The airport had issued a wind-shear warning for all runways before the accident, according to the AviationSafetyNetwork website. The condition occurs when wind direction changes abruptly. In extreme cases, it can be severe enough that a plane will lose lift and plunge. “It’s difficult to speculate about what happened in the last few minutes of the flight, but I want to thank the crew for their professionalism and evacuating the plane in a short time,” Sheikh Ahmed said. The pilot and co-pilot had logged more than 7,000 of flying hours each, he said. Cockpit Instructions Flight 521 had been cleared to land at Dubai, according to a transcript of an air-traffic control recording obtained by LiveATC.net. About a minute and a-half later, the tower gave a new instruction. “Emirates 521 climb straight ahead to 4,000 feet” (1,200 meters), a controller said, a command acknowledged by the pilot. The reason for the order wasn’t known. Typically, such instructions are issued after pilots request to abort touchdowns. Television footage and newswire photos showed that the aircraft slid to a halt on its belly, with one of its huge Rolls-Royce engines detached. The jet then quickly became engulfed in smoke and fire, which gutted the length of the fuselage and burned off the roof. The jumbo jet carried 282 passengers and 18 crew members, according to Emirates, the world’s biggest carrier by international traffic. Emergency services sprayed down the plane to put out the fire. Passengers and crew hurried to safety down inflatable slides. Thirteen people were hospitalized with minor injuries, Sheikh Ahmed said. Dubai airport, the world’s third-busiest by passenger numbers, shut down shortly after the crash and reopened at 6:30 p.m. on a restricted basis, giving priority to arriving flights. Investigation Teams The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board is sending a five-person team to assist with the investigation, a spokesman said. Under a United Nations treaty, the government from where the plane was manufactured is invited to participate in a probe. Despite the reported winds, the pilots should have been able to land the plane — or climb to safety if they were uncomfortable with the situation, said John Cox, president of Safety Operating Systems and a former airline pilot. “Professional pilots deal with high winds and gusty winds on a regular basis,” Cox said in an interview. “It’s like cruise-ship captains. You are going to have to learn to dock that thing when it’s calm or when winds are at 40 knots.” At this point, investigators won’t rule anything out, looking at weather conditions, possible pilot missteps and potential failures of aircraft systems, he said. The aircraft involved entered service in 2003 and was current for regular maintenance and inspections, Sheikh Ahmed. ‘Belly Flop’ John Nance, a former commercial and U.S. Air Force pilot who has flown a 777, said videos from the scene indicate that the landing gear may not have been fully deployed when Flight 521 touched down. “This is a situation where it looks very much like the aircraft was landing with gear up. It does appear this was a belly flop,” he said. “Why is a good question, especially if the aircraft was ordered to go around.” Boeing’s 777 model is the largest twin-engine airliner in production and the most used wide-body. Emirates is the biggest operator of the plane as well as of Airbus Group SE’s A380 double-decker. The Boeing aircraft is also one of the safest, with only a handful suffering irreparable damage since the model’s introduction two decades ago, including incidents caused by war or pilot error, according to Aviation Safety Network. Rolls-Royce Engine Boeing is standing by with a technical team to help U.S. authorities investigating the accident, the U.S. planemaker said on its website. Rolls-Royce Holdings Plc, which made the jet’s Trent 800 engines, also said it was ready to take part in the probe. Wednesday’s 3 1/2-hour flight started midmorning from Thiruvananthapuram on India’s southwest coast. Emirates serves the region mainly to ferry Indian workers to jobs in the Middle East. The carrier has built its business on exploiting the Persian Gulf’s position at the heart of intercontinental flight paths and the region’s oil industry, building Dubai into an airport that served 78 million passengers last year, making the hub the world’s biggest by international traffic. The carrier’s success has put pressure on earnings at European network airlines including Air France-KLM Group and Deutsche Lufthansa AG. Copyright 2016 Bloomberg.

An extensive underwater hunt in the southern Indian Ocean has not yet found the crash site, fuelling speculation it may be outside the current search zone, particularly if someone was at the controls at the end of the flight. A manned plane could have been glided down, allowing it to enter the water outside the 120,000 square kilometre (46,000 square mile) area being searched, some experts have suggested. But extensive testing by aircraft manufacturer Boeing and new Australian defence department data analysis both suggest that -- regardless of the possible actions of one or both of the pilots -- the jet dived into the ocean at high speed, The Australian reported. Once MH370 ran out of fuel and the engines flamed, it slowed before plunging down towards the water in a series of swoops -- dropping from 35,000 feet at a rate of between 12,000 feet a minute and 20,000 feet a minute, Boeing said, according to the report. The sharp dive was confirmed by a new data analysis by Australia's defence department involving signals sent automatically between the plane and a satellite, the head of the agency leading the MH370 hunt said. Australian Transport and Safety Bureau chief Greg Hood said this supported the view MH370 "was likely to have crashed in the 120,000 square kilometre (46,000 square mile) area now being searched," the paper said. The area was defined under the ATSB's "most likely" scenario that no-one was at the controls and the plane ran out of fuel. "The Australians leading the search do not doubt that the pilot may well have been responsible for the jet's disappearance but they say critics of the search strategy are wrong to assume that means they are looking in the wrong place," the report added. Malaysian officials said last week that one of the pilots used a home-made flight simulator to plot a very similar course to MH370's presumed final route, but warned this did not prove he deliberately crashed the plane.

The one-year-old plane had its original engine replaced three months ago, meaning it has gone through two engines within 12 months, according to The Australian.

'We have asked engine manufacturer GE for an explanation.

Share this article Share There have been nine separate in-flight issues with the GEnx engine on the Boeing 787 during the past year, including a Qatar Airways 787 flight travelling from Norway to Qatar that was forced to shut off its engine and divert the plane. A General Electric spokeswoman told Daily Mail Australia that the GEnx-1B engine has 'more than three million hours of operation on more than 250 air planes.' Flight JQ12 was heading from Narita, Japan, to the Gold Coast when it was diverted after the pilot was alerted to possible oil pressure issues in one of the GEnx engines (stock image) 'GE is actively supporting Jetstar to ensure that the Boeing 787 returns to airline service as soon as possible. The engine event is under investigation,' she said.  'GE continually monitors and analyzes the performance of the GEnx fleet in service. Based on the engine fleet’s service history, we are not aware of operational issues that would hazard the continued safe flight of aircraft powered by these engines.' Qantas will receive eight Boeing 787s with GEnx engines in October this year and integrate them into their international fleet, replacing five older Boering 747s. A General Electric spokeswoman said the incident is under investigation but argued that the engine is safe (pictured is a maintenance technician works on a jet engine of a Boeing C-17) Flight JQ12's more than 300 passengers spent 24 hours in Guam before continuing to the Gold Coast on Monday morning on another Jetstar 787 Dreamliner  Flight JQ12's more than 300 passengers spent 24 hours in Guam before continuing to the Gold Coast on Monday morning on another Jetstar 787 Dreamliner.  Some frustrated passengers took to social media to slam the airline for the lack of communication around what alternative travel arrangements were being made. 'Beyond ridiculous, understand safety comes first, but no one is communicating! Never experienced such poor customer service,' one woman wrote on Twitter.

The jumbo jet is officially going extinct -- here's a look at its glory days By Benjamin Zhang of Business Insider | < PREVIOUS SLIDE SLIDE 1 of 53 NEXT SLIDE > Boeing 747 production is slowly coming to an end Boeing might stop producing its iconic 747 aircraft. "If we are unable to obtain sufficient orders and/or market, production and other risks cannot be mitigated, we could record additional losses that may be material, and it is reasonably possible that we could decide to end production of the 747," Boeing said in a regulatory filing. Boeing is currently producing one 747 every month, but said it will cut down starting in September to one every other month. For more than 40 years, the wide-body jumbo jet ruled the skies. But with changes in aviation regulations and airline-business strategy and improvements in turbofan-engine technology, the days of huge aircraft are drawing to a close. Since its introduction in 1969, the Boeing 747 has transformed the way people travel. With its ability to fly 500 passengers 6,000 miles, the jumbo jet allowed airlines to reach new destinations while achieving profitability by lowering the per-seat cost of operation. Over the years, Boeing was joined in the long-haul wide-body market by offerings from McDonnell Douglas, Lockheed, and Airbus. In 2005, Airbus introduced the double-deck A380-800 — perhaps the most capable rival the Boeing jumbo jet had ever encountered. But these days, Boeing and Airbus are having a hard time finding new buyers for both aircraft. The cost of purchasing such a large craft, combined with the fact that they're relatively energy inefficient, makes them impractical. Demand for the big jets has also dwindled as aviation regulations changed, airlines moved away from the hub-and-spoke model for their routes, and jet-engine technology improved — making it safer for aircraft to fly long distances with just two engines. Sadly, even the 747's freighter business is struggling. Airbus hasn't won an airline order for the double-decker jet since it sold Emirates a batch two years ago. Although there are rumors that Japan's ANA is looking to buy, don't expect many others to join in. James Hogan, chief executive of Emirates' rival, Etihad, was unequivocal when asked by Business Insider if the group will buy another four-engine jet. "No, we're done," Hogan said. "We just believe in two-engine technology — they are much more efficient." And Virgin Atlantic CEO Craig Kreeger told Business Insider that he was surprised Airbus was able to find as many takers for the A380 as they have. Long-distance and transoceanic flights were traditionally exclusively covered by the 747 and its fellow three- or four-engine, wide-body jumbos because, when it comes to the engine count on an airliner, the thinking was that there is safety in numbers. But as modern turbofan engines became more reliable, and engine failures far less common, the thinking and the regulations changed. As a result, most airlines have turned to twin-engine mini jumbos that are more fuel-efficient. Further, airlines are moving away from the hub-and-spoke business model that calls for massive numbers of passengers to be routed through a single mega hub. Smaller, fuel-efficient jets, such as the Boeing 787 Dreamliner, allow airlines to offer passengers nonstop, point-to-point service without transiting through a hub.

Photo: Reuters mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 10:30 PM, August 10, 2016 Updated: 5:30 AM, August 11, 2016 NEW YORK - Boeing Co <BA.N> said on Wednesday it will not increase 787 output and could further cut 777 output unless sales of both jets improve, its clearest indication yet that its production of large jetliners may have peaked for now. "If the market's not going to demand it, we're not going to go," Chief Financial Officer Greg Smith said on the sidelines of an investor conference in New York by global investment bank Jefferies, confirming remarks made during the formal program. "It's not the end of the world" if Boeing keeps 787 production at 12 a month instead of lifting it to 14 as planned, Smith said during the event. "We can still be profitable in the program as I see it today at 12." Analysts said Smith's statement confirmed that Boeing will not overproduce widebody planes and, most importantly, does not foresee an accounting charge for the 787 if output stays at 12. Boeing took about $1.7 billion in after-tax charges in its latest result for the 787 and 747 programs to account for excess 787 inventory and slow 747 sales. Smith said the company would decide in the next two months whether to cut 777 output further. If it fails to sell enough 777s to bridge the gap to new 777X production, "then we will make an adjustment accordingly," he said. His comments went beyond what he and Boeing Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg told analysts after the company released quarterly results last month. Muilenburg said Boeing would "keep supply and demand in balance" but did not discuss keeping 787 production at 12 a month or cutting 777 further. Low oil prices and a series of boom years have slowed orders for new widebody jetliners, raising concerns that Boeing will notch down cash and profit targets. Smith said on Wednesday that Boeing still has about two years to decide whether to raise 787 output, given lead times for components, and could still generate rising cash flow and profit if production rates "moderate" on the 787 and 777. The list price for the mid-sized 787 is $264.6 million, but airlines typically receive steep discounts. Boeing has won eight net 777 orders this year and 19 net 787 orders. It already plans to reduce 777 production by 15 percent next year as it switches to the 777X. Boeing shares rose 0.6 percent to close at $132.28 on the New York Stock Exchange.

By Gazette Staff   |   August 10, 2016 In mid-July, Gov. Mary Fallin, along with a number of state and community leaders, praised Boeing aerospace company as it cut a blue ribbon symbolizing the $80 million, 290,000-square-foot facility was open for business in southeast Oklahoma City. According to NewsOK.com, leaders praised an aerospace engineers tax credit for luring Boeing, which in return promised 800 new jobs. The company is known for designing, manufacturing and selling airplanes, rotorcrafts, rockets and satellites. Boeing moved operations from Washington to Oklahoma City; St. Louis, Missouri; Jacksonville, Florida; and Patuxent River, Maryland. A week after the OKC fanfare, Boeing handed layoff notices to OKC employees, NewsOK.com reported. The company was mum on the number of workers impacted by the potential layoffs. “Boeing is still committed to doing business in Oklahoma,” Jennifer Hogan, a Boeing spokeswoman, told NewsOK.com.

Boeing (NYSE: BA), Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT), Orbital ATK (NYSE:OA), Sierra Nevada, Bigelow Aerospace and NanoRacks were chosen through the Next Space Technologies for Exploration Partnerships-2 initiative, the agency said Wednesday. The six companies will perform work over a two-year period and contribute at least 30 percent of the overall program cost, NASA noted. NASA sought proposals for the second batch of NextSTEP partners in April to perform research and development work on deep space habitation systems, advanced propulsion technologies and small satellites. “The next human exploration capabilities needed beyond the Space Launch System rocket and Orion capsule are deep space, long duration habitation and in-space propulsion,” said Jason Crusan, NASA director of advanced exploration systems. “We are now adding focus and specifics on the deep space habitats where humans will live and work independently for months or years at a time, without cargo supply deliveries from Earth,” Crusan added. Bigelow Aerospace, Boeing, Lockheed and Orbital ATK compose the initial batch of the agency’s NextSTEP partners. NextSTEP-2 efforts will support commercial investment in low-Earth orbit, operational deep space habitation for missions near the moon as well as the planned expedition to Mars in the 2020s, according to NASA. The prototypes will be developed to help establish design standards, common interfaces and requirements and mitigate risks for the final flight systems. The agency also looks to collaborate with international partners to achieve deep-space habitation goals.

[Image above] Credit: NIST   NANOMATERIALS   Carbon nanotube “stitches” strengthen composites The newest Airbus and Boeing passenger jets flying today are made primarily from advanced composite materials such as carbon fiber reinforced plastic—extremely light, durable materials that reduce the overall weight of the plane by as much as 20% compared to aluminum-bodied planes. Such lightweight airframes translate directly to fuel savings, which is a major point in advanced composites’ favor.   Swapping substrates improves edges of graphene nanoribbons Miniscule ribbons of graphene are highly sought-after building blocks for semiconductor devices because of their predicted electronic properties. But making these nanostructures has remained a challenge. Now, a team of researchers from China and Japan have devised a new method to make the structures in the lab.   X-ray microscopy technique images nanoscale workings of rechargeable batteries There’s a new tool in the push to engineer rechargeable batteries that last longer and charge more quickly. An X-ray microscopy technique recently developed at Lawrence Berkeley National Lab has given scientists the ability to image nanoscale changes inside lithium-ion battery particles as they charge and discharge.     ENERGY   Formula of cadmium-tellurium solar cells optimized Solar cells based on cadmium and tellurium could move closer to theoretical levels of efficiency because of some sleuthing by researchers at the Oak Ridge National Lab. The team used advanced microscopy techniques to discover efficiency differences of crystalline structures of various mixtures of cadmium, tellurium, and selenium. In fact, selenium is an integral part of the formulation that resulted in a world record for solar cell efficiency.   Moisture helps catalyst in fuel cells: Proton pinball on the catalyst Thanks to a reaction that resembles a sort of proton pinball game, a thin layer of moisture on the surface of a catalysts can improve the efficiency of fuel cells, devices used to transform chemical energy (a fuel like hydrogen, for example) directly into electricity without releasing greenhouse gases in emissions.   Tiny high-performance solar cells turn power generation sideways University of Wisconsin–Madison engineers have created high-performance, micro-scale solar cells that outshine comparable devices in key performance measures. The engineers created a densely packed, side-by-side array of miniature electrodes on top of transparent glass. The resulting structure separates light-harvesting and charge-conducting functions between the two components.   Next generation anode to improve lithium-ion batteries Researchers at the University of California, Riverside have created a new silicon-tin nanocomposite anode that could lead to lithium-ion batteries that can be charged and discharged more times before they reach the end of their useful lives. The longer-lasting batteries could be used in everything from handheld electronic devices to electric vehicles.   Making nail polish while powering fuel cells Hydrogen is widely regarded as a promising and clean alternative energy source. The traditional source of hydrogen (H2) for fuel cell use is water, which is split into H2 and oxygen (O2). But O2 is a low-value product. So, this week in ACS Central Science, researchers report a new approach and a new catalyst that can produce not just hydrogen but also valuable chemicals, including the most common ingredient in nail polish.   Semi-transparent solar cells with thermal mirror capability developed Using perovskites, a Korean research team at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) and Sungkyunkwan University developed a semi-transparent solar cell that is highly efficient and, additionally, functions very effectively as a thermal-mirror. The team has developed a top transparent electrode (TTE) that works well with perovskite solar cells.   Iowa State scientists develop quick-destructing battery to power ‘transient’ devices Iowa State University scientists have developed a self-destructing, lithium-ion battery capable of delivering 2.5 V and dissolving or dissipating in 30 minutes when dropped in water. The battery can power a desktop calculator for about 15 minutes.     OTHER RESEARCH   Olympians suit up in high-tech apparel to shave seconds When seconds count, the right clothing matters. For the Rio Olympics, Nike used 3-D printing technology to develop small silicone protrusions for redirecting air flow around the runner. Body scanners helped Adidas design suits to keep swimmers in ideal form. Swiss cycling specialist Assos turned to wind tunnels to craft custom, form-fitting suits for the U.S. cycling team.   Unlocking the secrets of creeping concrete Researchers at UCLA found that calcium-silicate-hydrates, the binding phase that holds cement paste together, tend to dissolve at high-stress regions, and re-precipitate at low-stress regions. This is in correspondence with Le Chatelier’s principle, also known as the equilibrium law. “As a result of such dissolution-precipitation behavior, a macroscopic, time-dependent ‘creep’ deformation manifests.”   Method predicts which alloys will form bulk metallic glass Bulk metallic glasses are metallic alloys whose neatly ordered atomic structure can be altered into an amorphous, non-crystalline structure. However, these alloys are complex, often containing five or six different elements, including expensive noble metals like gold or palladium—and scientists have no clue which combinations of elements will form them. Now, researchers have developed a method to predict which alloys may form a bulk metallic glass.   Novel porous materials made from flexible ‘spaghetti-like’ molecules Known for their extraordinary surface area, a sugar packet equivalent of MOF provides a city block of area to absorb gas or catalyze reactions. But scientists recently uprooted the belief that these frameworks must be made from rigid starting materials. Their new design strategy transformed flexible polymers into 3-D porous structures by incorporating the flexible polymers into the synthesis of MOFs.   Ultracompact photodetector for optical data transmission Glass-fiber cables transmit information over long distances at the speed of light. Once they have reached their destination, however, these optical signals have to be converted into electrical signals for subsequent processing in the computer. Karlsruhe Institute of Technology researchers have now developed a novel type of photodetector that needs far less space than conventional ones.   Power amplifiers for 5G made of gallium nitride Fraunhofer scientists are manufacturing transistors and microchips that are only a few square millimeters in size out of the semiconductor material gallium nitride. “Due to its special crystal structure, the same voltages can be applied at even higher frequencies, leading to a better power and efficiency performance,” says one of the researchers.   Back to Previous Page « « Previous Post     |    Next Post » » Tags: advanced composites, aerospace composites, alloy, anode, apparel, batteries, battery charge, bulk metallic glass, cadmium-tellurium solar, carbon nanotubes, catalyst, composites, concrete, concrete creep, data transmission, fuel cells, gallium-nitride, graphene, graphene nanoribbonss, high-tech apparel, li-ion, lithium-ions, materials stories, metallic glass, MOF, nail polish, nanotubes, Olympics, OMS, optical data, other materials, photodetector, porous materials, power amplifier, proton, rechargeable batteries, self-destructing battery, semiconductors, solar, solar cells, solar efficiency, solar energy, solar power, thermal mirror, TTE, X-ray microscopy Related Posts Other materials stories that may be of interest Ceramic and glass business news of the week Video: Magnetic ink prints self-healing devices that fix themselves in mere milliseconds Other materials stories that may be of interest Leave a Reply Cancel reply You must be logged in to post a comment.

The world of luxury travel is epitomized by the image of stepping off a private jet to some high power meeting or exclusive destination. However the allure of actually owning your own private jet appears to be fading fast for many corporations and wealthy people as a range of other options hit the market. VistaJet provides private jet travel on its fleet of more than 65 Bombardier jets without committing clients to any asset purchase. The company was founded in 2004 by Swiss national Thomas Flohr. He told CNBC that revenues in his business are currently booming. "Companies are presently reluctant to put a $50 million plane on their own balance sheet. That's a pretty hard sell for any CFO walking in to boardroom at this time." Flohr set up his business in the belief that the private jet market was being underserved by a handful of U.S. firms who offer different businesses a fractional stake in a plane, which they then share. Daniel Acker | Bloomberg | Getty Images A Netjets Inc. sign stands hear a new Embraer Phenom 300 jet at Eppley Airfield in Omaha, Nebraska, U.S. One of the better known who does this is NetJets, a subsidiary of Warren Buffet's Berkshire Hathaway. NetJets clients sign contracts that choose an appropriate plane and then pay for the hours that they need it to fly, an arrangement which the company described to CNBC as 'vastly less costly' than owning a plane. Mark Wilson, President of NetJets Europe said while global growth is flat lining, Europe is picking up. "To date 2016 has also been a strong period of growth for us and we continue to increase our market share; we have seen a 4.1 percent increase in revenue flights for the first half of the year year-on-year and a 7.5 percent increase in passengers flown during the same period," he told CNBC. Wilson said he also sees a more 'cost savvy' customer who doesn't see value in owning a jet. "NetJets manage every aspect, from ground transport to slot bookings and flight permits. "Previously corporations would have had to employ an entire flight department or management company to take care of this," he said. Victor is a private jet service based out of London. The company doesn't sell jets for full or fractual ownership but focuses solely on 'on demand' chartering of third party operators. Clive Jackson, CEO & founder of Victor agrees that European private aviation is expanding. "Private jet travel is up 2.8 percent across Western Europe with private jet charter, specifically, on the up in 18 of Europe's top 20 airports. "We have seen a significant upsurge in bookings this summer on a global scale – everywhere from Las Vegas and Miami through to Ibiza, Mallorca, Nice and Sardinia. Summer requests for Ibiza, in particular, are up 441 percent year-on-year," he told CNBC by email Tuesday. Jackson said European business no longer looks upon owning a private jet as a worthy investment, but they still see the value of using one. "[Our] users are highly entrepreneurial and competing on both a European and global business stage – looking to gain competitive advantage from recent Brexit developments by getting things done – moving - more quickly than many of their institutional competitors," he said. In terms of what is next for private aviation, Jackson sees limited scope for subscription-style charter models who demand an upfront fee for the promise of a future service. The Victor founder is betting that business will opt instead for an app based 'on demand' service as businesses veer away from commercial flying.

The Boeing 777 disappeared on March 8, 2014 en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing with 239 people onboard. An extensive underwater hunt in the southern Indian Ocean has not yet found the crash site, fuelling speculation it may be outside the current search zone, particularly if someone was at the controls. A manned plane could have been glided down, allowing it to enter the water outside the 120,000 square kilometre (46,000 square mile) area being searched, some experts have suggested. But testing by Boeing and fresh Australian defence department suggest that — regardless of the possible actions of one or both of the pilots — the jet dived into the ocean at high speed, The Australian reported. Once MH370 ran out of fuel and the engines flamed, it slowed before plunging down towards the water in a series of swoops — dropping from 35,000 feet at a rate of between 12,000 feet a minute and 20,000 feet a minute, Boeing said. The sharp dive was confirmed by new data analysis by Australia’s defence department involving signals sent automatically between the plane and a satellite, the head of the agency leading the MH370 hunt said. Australian Transport and Safety Bureau chief Greg Hood said this supported the view MH370 “was likely to have crashed in the 1,20,000 square kilometre area now being searched,” the paper said. Parts of the plane have been recovered on islands across the Pacific.

Close share panel Image copyright PA Image caption The Chinooks are maintained at Fleetlands with technical support from Odiham and other UK locations Apprenticeships at a helicopter repair site which currently maintains the UK's Chinook fleet have been stopped for the first time in its history. Vector Aerospace, which runs the Fleetlands site in Gosport, Hampshire, blamed a drop in workload for its decision to suspend the 2017 intake. It comes after the firm recently lost out on a contract to upgrade some of the Chinooks, putting 60 jobs at risk. The site was sold by the MoD to Vector in 2008. It has offered apprenticeships at its training facility for the past 75 years, taking about eight apprentices each year in Gosport in recent times. The three-year programme offers successful applicants the chance to get hands-on experience on the maintenance, repair and overhaul of rotary wing aircraft. Image copyright PA Image caption The then-prime minister David Cameron announced a Chinook contract at Fleetlands during a visit to Portsmouth in February Fleetlands history Opened in 1940 to repair and overhaul naval fixed-wing aircraft, including the Hawker Sea Fury and Supermarine Seafire Known as the Royal Naval Air Yard, the establishment gradually started dealing with helicopters as the number of them in service grew As most fixed-wing aircraft in the Navy disappeared towards the end of the century, the site became the main location for rotary wing maintenance In 1999, the Defence Aviation Repair Agency (DARA) was formed to take over the work and maintained Army and RAF helicopters, along with naval aircraft In 2008, the Fleetlands facility was bought by Vector Aerospace and supported Chinooks as well as Lynx and Sea King helicopters until they went out of service Gosport MP Caroline Dinenage, who has been in talks with Vector and union representatives at Fleetlands, said it was "extremely disappointing" to see the scheme suspended. She added: "The company provides an excellent pipeline for young people from our area to gain technical skills for a rewarding career. I understand this decision will be reviewed over the coming year and I will be urging them to reconsider." A Vector spokesman said it was disappointed to suspend the scheme but was "fully committed to our current apprentices" and would review the programme in the coming year. The private firm works closely with Boeing, which builds military craft for the Ministry of Defence, and had been expecting to secure a contract to upgrade the fleet with a Digital Automatic Flight Control System (DAFCS). 'Constructive negotiations' But Boeing decided to take the work in-house, despite Vector previously completing another Chinook upgrade package for the manufacturer. Vector is talking with union officials to try and transfer some staff to Boeing but no guarantees have been given. The company's long-term deal with Boeing to provide maintenance of the Chinook fleet has not been affected. Steve Burnell, managing director of Aircraft Support Boeing, said the decision not to award Vector the contract came after a "long and detailed study on the grounds of cost". A Unite spokesperson said it was "engaged in constructive negotiations with the Vector management" but declined to comment further. The Fleetlands site, which has historically supported the MoD's helicopter fleet, has seen its workload shrink in recent years after the Sea King and Lynx helicopters went out of service. Vector, which employs 800 people in Gosport, moved into the civil aviation market to boost its workload.

The center monitors video cameras, license plate readers, shot spotter and other streams of information to fight crime. Photo by David Carson, dcarson@post-dispatch.com Gary Kreie is a numbers guy. A retired software engineer from Boeing, he used to work on advanced missile systems. Now he has a new passion. In his spare time, he crunches numbers on comparing St. Louis to other cities in the nation. “I’ve been complaining for a long time that all these city rankings are unfair,” says Kreie, who lives in Des Peres. The ones that bug him the most are the ones that compare cities by crime. St. Louis often gets labeled one of the most dangerous cities in the country, in part because the crime in the city’s urban core is often compared with cities with a much larger footprint. As a result, the region Kreie, 65, has called home for 39 years gets a bad rap. He’s hardly the first to note this reality, yet another of the negative effects of having the city of St. Louis and St. Louis County operate as two separate governmental entities. Three years ago, for instance, the city and county police chiefs asked the FBI to consider reporting the city and county crime rates together, rather than separately, to make the comparison with other, more unified cities more fair. The proposal fell on deaf ears. The move would have dropped St. Louis immediately from one of the most dangerous cities in the country to one of the safest. Kreie, though, is a problem solver. He doesn’t just want the crime numbers to be reported more accurately, he also wants the region to work together to reduce the crime rate where it is highest, in the urban core. To that end, he has an idea that may seem radical to some. Kreie wants his West County neighbors — and those in the entire metropolitan statistical area of St. Louis — to pay higher taxes in order to attack the crime problem in the city’s urban core. Kreie’s motivation is selfish. He believes that reducing crime in the urban core will raise property values throughout the region. Last month, Kreie published his proposal on the St. Louis Strong website (stlstrong1764.org). The nonprofit was started by Chesterfield native Jake Hollander, who left a public relations job in Washington to come back to his hometown and be a part of the movement to unite the city and the county. Lately, the website has been asking people to weigh in with ideas for consolidation in the region. In February, Kreie started comparing crime numbers and home values in various cities across the country, and what he found surprised him. St. Louis, it turns out, has the largest disparity between suburban crime and urban crime in the country, based on how he breaks down the numbers by ZIP code. He expected to find home values correlating with low suburban crime, but that’s not what the numbers showed. Plenty of places with similarly low suburban crime have much higher home values than St. Louis. But, based on his research, there appears to be a direct connection between low home values and a high disparity in the crime rates between urban cores and surrounding suburbs. Kreie’s solution — with the goal of raising property values throughout St. Louis — is for the suburbs to increase their property taxes for a period of time, in order to intensely fight crime in the city. “Getting resources to the urban core will raise everybody’s property values,” Kreie says. “St. Louis needs to think more regionally. We’re not getting resources from the outer region and the suburbs into the core.” In comparing St. Louis to Minneapolis, for instance, Kreie notes that the overall crime index there is lower, and home values are higher. What sort of investment would the average homeowner in the region make if they could reduce the crime rate in St. Louis while raising their home value over a period of 10 or 12 years? Kreie’s math says the investment would pay off. He leaves to the experts how that money should be spent: more police officers, better schools, programs to reduce gun violence. But he hopes the folks who live where he does see the value in making such an investment. “We’ve got to find a regional solution to our crime problem,” Kreie says. “Maybe economics is the only thing that will convince people in the suburbs to think regionally.” Tony Messenger • 314-340-8518 @tonymess on Twitter tmessenger@post-dispatch.com Tags Tony Messenger Crime St. Louis Strong Better Together Jake Hollander Gary Kreie St. Louis Boeing Value Tony Messenger Tony Messenger is the metro columnist for the St. Louis Post-Dispatch.

The Boeing 777 disappeared on March 8, 2014 en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing with 239 people onboard, most of them Chinese. An extensive underwater hunt in the southern Indian Ocean has not yet found the crash site, fueling speculation it may be outside the current search zone, particularly if someone was at the controls at the end of the flight. A manned plane could have been glided down, allowing it to enter the water outside the 120,000-square-kilometer area being searched, some aviation experts have suggested. But extensive testing by aircraft manufacturer Boeing and new Australian defense department data analysis both suggest that — regardless of the possible actions of one or both of the pilots — the jet dived into the ocean at high speed, The Australian reported. Once MH370 ran out of fuel and the engines flamed, it slowed before plunging down toward the water in a series of swoops — dropping from 10,668 meters at a rate of between 3,658 meters a minute and 6,096 meters a minute, Boeing said, according to the report. The sharp dive was confirmed by a new data analysis by Australia’s defense department involving signals sent automatically between the plane and a satellite, the head of the agency leading the MH370 hunt said. Australian Transport and Safety Bureau chief Greg Hood said this supported the view MH370 “was likely to have crashed in the 120,000-square-kilometre area now being searched,” the paper said. The area was defined under the ATSB’s “most likely” scenario that no one was at the controls and the plane ran out of fuel. “The Australians leading the search do not doubt that the pilot may well have been responsible for the jet’s disappearance but they say critics of the search strategy are wrong to assume that means they are looking in the wrong place,” the report added.

View Latest Posts >>> ‘MH370 fell out of sky after engine failure’ By Ian Greenhalgh on August 9, 2016 It was a scheduled passenger flight from Kuala Lumpur bound for Beijing and had 239 passengers and crew on board when it disappeared It is more than two years since MH370 literally vanished into thin air and we are still none the wiser about what really happened to the plane and it’s passengers and crew. There have been a few pieces of wreckage washed up around the shores of the Indian Ocean and now this signal analysis, but to be quite frank, I don’t believe any of it, I think it’s just disinfo, part of the psyop. I don’t believe the official story that the plane turned south and flew out into the empty southern oceans until it ran out of fuel and crashed into the sea to never be seen again, I never have.  So what do I think happened to MH370? To be brutally honest, I don’t know and in the absence of any concrete evidence I am reluctant to even make a guess. There have been a handful of tantalising pieces of circumstantial evidence that points to a very different narrative to the official one. Notorious Israeli disinfo mouthpiece Christopher Bollyn gave us a big fat clue that his Israeli masters were at least partly involved when he wrote a mysterious article about a Boeing painted in Malaysian Airlines livery being stored awaiting an unknown purpose in a hangar in Israel. Most of the rest of the most intriguing clues to the MH370 case are actually part of the MH17 story – a virtually identical Boeing of the same Malaysian Airlines that crashed into a field in Ukraine. As someone who rarely believes in coincidences, I believe that the MH370 and MH17 cases are linked, and probably very directly linked. I won’t go so far as to state that I believe, as some do, that MH370, after disappearing, was next seen in smoking pieces in a Ukrainian field pretending to be MH17, but I will go as far as to say that I am very open to the possibility of that being the case. VT published a story that originally appeared in a French publication that alleged that the bodies from the MH17 crash glowed in the twilight as they lay in that Ukrainian field and that this luminescent glow was caused by the formaldehyde that the bodies had been preserved in – the implication being that these were the bodies of the passengers of MH370. That story has never been fully verified, neither have the rumours that many of the bodies were clearly Chinese (most of the MH370 passengers were Chinese) or that the bodies were already quite rotten when they hit the ground. A refridgerated train was brought in to move the bodies into with the reason given that in the hot summer weather, putrefaction was setting in, which could support the theory too. Ultimately, there are still far too many unknowns in both the MH370 and MH17 cases for us to be able to form a solid hypothesis of what really happened; however, when it comes to who did it, there are some more pieces of circumstantial evidence to consider. Firstly, Malaysia had hosted a war crimes tribunal in it’s capital, Kuala Lumpur that found both the state of Israel and a senior Israel general guilty of crimes against humanity for the massacres at the Sabbra and Shattila refugee camps in the 1980s, that fact provides a significant motive. Secondly, flight MH17 supposedly originated at Schiphol airport which is notorious as the hub of the Israeli international arms smuggling/dealing operation, a Mossad base and were the security is in the hands of infamous Israeli security company (or should that be Mossad front) ICTS. Until more solid evidence comes along, we remain largely in the dark about the true story of the two Malaysian Airlines flights; however, we can say with a fair degree of certainty that this new release of signal analysis by the Australians is just another part of the cover-up and can be disregarded as evidence. __________ Business Standard ‘MH370 fell out of sky after engine failure’ Australian defence scientists who analysed signals from missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 have revealed the Boeing 777 fell very fast before crashing into the Indian Ocean off the coast of western Australia. Australian media reported on Tuesday that data analysis and manufacturer simulations showed it was likely the aircraft lost engine power before falling out of the sky at a rate of up to 20,000 feet per minute on March 8, 2014, Xinhua news agency reported. An aircraft attempting a regular landing – or a crash landing in water – would descend at a rate of around 2,000 feet per minute, raising doubts over previous predictions that the plane “landed” intact in the water before breaking up, the analysts said. Australian scientists believed that prior to its final moments, the jet made a number of automated “handshake” signals with satellites on the ground near Perth in Western Australia. After six of those handshakes, a seventh, out-of-sequence signal came from the jet, indicating engine failure likely from lack of fuel. The data gives life to the theory that MH370 fell out of the sky, and did not glide to a final crash-landing spot in the Indian Ocean. Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) chief commissioner Greg Hood said the scientists’ analysis of the signals closely matched a flight scenario in which there was no pilot at the controls at the point of impact – in contrast to previous theories about how MH370 went down. Hood said the signal data meant MH370 likely crashed in the 120,000-square-km search area now being combed by Australian authorities. If the aircraft had glided to a final resting place – as previous theories had hinted – the plane may have gone down outside of the current search area. MH370 was a scheduled passenger flight from Kuala Lumpur bound for Beijing. It had 239 passengers and crew on board when it disappeared on March 8, 2014. Related Posts: MH370 Revisited Yet Again!

FaceBook Comments 10 Responses to "‘MH370 fell out of sky after engine failure’" roger  August 10, 2016 at 8:13 pm Those having some understanding on Early Warning Radars, do know that Australia´s OTH (over the Horizon) radars have surpassing coverage to detect the very balyhooed MH370 course straight down the South Indian Ocean, close to Australia; much more considering that a 777 has a size that can hardly be missed by radars, even by less advanced types. The fact that Australia volunteered to be in charge of the search, doesn´t explain the denial to hand over the radar records requested by Malaysian authorities. Also, an air Marshall of RAAF recommended to direct the operations when in case, most of the work was done by ships and ocean work calls for naval expertise. So far, the Maldives people witnessing the low flying 777 has more credibility than a computer revelations, that might be just theoretical ruminating. No farewell message or reasonable causes that may have forced the pilot to such a drastic decision cannot be a clue seriously considered. Most suicides are accompanied with a message to have the rest World as spectators of personal drama, as such, disappearing without traces would be a countersense.

Government has classified data, which they sometimes choose to share with corporations with a need to know. The engine telemetry data collection was part of a program to flight follow twin-engined airliners to confirm that they could safely operate over open oceans. RR confirmed the telemetry data was being received and at what time the transmission stopped. Which is why they had to expand the search field and find a new (false) probable drop point.

However both cases remain among the most sketchy imaginable on which to draw any conclusions. Log in to Reply ayelyahbenjamin  August 9, 2016 at 10:57 pm NEO…Another Journalist Exposes MH17 – W Engdahl… in a personal interview with the Veterans Today Tbilisi Georgia bureau chief Jeffrey Silverman pointedly shared with Engdahl the possible complicity of the Inmarsat Company in the MH17 event. INMARSAT controls most international air trafﬁc control communications systems. According to Silverman, during the earlier disappearance of Malaysian Airlines ﬂight MH370, the ﬂight was “lost” due to Inmarsat turning off their signals, and it still refuses today to release the data it has about this ﬂight”. . …INMARSAT…originally founded in 1979, a not-for-proﬁt, set up at the behest of the International Maritime Organization , a UN body, for the purpose of establishing a satellite communications network for the maritime community. When the organization was converted into a private company in 1999, the business was split into two parts…the largest single owner of INMARSAT: Harbinger Capital March 2008 it was disclosed that U.S. Hedge Fund Harbinger Capital owned 28% of the company. Harbinger Group Inc. (NYSE:HRG), formerly Zapata Corporation, is a holding company based in Rochester, New York, and originating from an oil company started by a group including the former US president George H. W. Bush. Links between the company and the United States Central Intelligence Agency exist . In 2009, it was renamed the Harbinger Group Inc. in an attempt to thwart such afﬁliations”….from A Little Bit of Prestidigitation – Chip Tatum Log in to Reply Zaguero  August 9, 2016 at 5:50 pm “Australian scientists believed that prior to its final moments, the jet made a number of automated “handshake” signals with satellites on the ground near Perth in Western Australia.” Satellites on the ground? Seriously? Log in to Reply Dan Sheppard  August 9, 2016 at 5:24 pm The ‘Diego Garcia’ theory on MH370 is by far the most promising of them all so far, with an actual evidence the phone data provided by missing passenger Phillip Wood to support this theory. The Freescale Electronics Superconductor Patent ownership was the motive, this theory is also supported by the fact that Washington/Pentagon and its cronies are currently trying in anyway they can to limit China’s military intelligence capabilities, as these superconductors would of been used by China in military drone and missile hardware. Both incidents involving MH370 and MH17 were ‘two birds one stone’ attacks, both aircraft were taken out to ‘punish’ Kuala Lumpur, but also, both aircraft had the underlying motive, one with the Superconductor patent, and the other (MH17) with the 6 AIDS Researchers and Delegates heading to a conference in Melbourne. Log in to Reply Dan Sheppard  August 9, 2016 at 5:26 pm Correction “semi-conductor” Gary Jones  August 9, 2016 at 4:27 pm Flew to Diego Garcia as noted by RR data. All Boeing planes have Uninterruptible Auto Pilot feature which in effect makes hijacking impossible. Such planes cannot disappear. Scientists working on nano computers to guide weaponry were on board. They were flown on to Israel for slave labor on the aforementioned project to give Zionist supremacy in such miniature weaponry. Also note the info from William Bourne. Log in to Reply Ian Greenhalgh  August 9, 2016 at 2:44 pm I agree, my Aussie friends have long ago educated me on how their country works. You are also correct about RR, MH370 was never missing, RR and therefore the British govt, always knew exactly where it was.

Follow @NASASpaceFlight Home Forums L2 Sign Up ISS Commercial Shuttle SLS/Orion Russian European Chinese Unmanned Other Pad hardware changes preview new era for Space Coast August 9, 2016 by Chris Bergin Ongoing work at the Kennedy Space Center and Cape Canaveral is continuing to lay the groundwork to once again launch American astronauts from home soil. While the huge Pad 39B equipment enters a critical period of testing at KSC for the Space Launch System, the Crew Access Arm and White Room is scheduled to be installed on the SLC-41 pad in the coming days, in preparation for Starliner missions. Starliner: Even before Boeing’s progression into 2012’s Commercial Crew integrated Capability (CCiCap) contract with NASA, plans for converting SLC-41 into a dual use pad for Atlas V were being designed. At the time, Atlas V was looking to launch both Starliner (then known only as CST-100) and Dream Chaser crew missions from the Cape Canaveral pad. Dream Chaser was shown in the majority of the envisioning, albeit preliminary views of a crew walking across an exposed platform to board their spacecraft. However, a crew “walking the plank” to a spacecraft attached to the pointy end of an Atlas V launch vehicle was never likely to be a real-world scenario Unsurprisingly, those pad designs soon evolved. Renderings and videos created by Dream Chaser’s parents at SNC showed a pad that began to include a Crew Access Arm and a White Room in the envisioning, allowing astronauts to complete their final leg to the spacecraft – following an elevator ride to the top of the pad – via an enclosed structure. Although Dream Chaser lost out on launching NASA astronauts from SLC-41, she is expected to launch cargo missions on the Atlas V. With Starliner effectively beat Dream Chaser to join SpaceX’s Dragon 2 in the honor of launching American astronauts from home soil for the first time since Atlantis’ STS-135 mission, SLC-41 still requires “crew rating”. See Also Starliner/CST-100 Forum L2 Commercial Crew Click here to Join L2 Originally built for the Titan IIIC and subsequently used by the Titan IIIE and Titan IV before being rebuilt for the Atlas between 1999 and 2002, SLC-41 supports all of the Atlas V’s East Coast launches with West Coast launches making use of Space Launch Complex 3E at Vandenberg Air Force Base. Historically, SLC-41 has seen a share of notable satellite launches, including the Helios probe, the Viking probes to Mars, and the Voyager interplanetary and interstellar deep space probes by Titan rockets, as well as the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, New Horizons, Juno, and the Mars Science Laboratory “Curiosity” missions by the Atlas V rocket. Work to convert the pad for its new era of hosting Starliner launches has been ongoing between Atlas V’s bread and butter missions launching an array of spacecraft from her Cape pad. The service tower, designed to provide access to the CST-100 Starliner for pre-launch processing, crew access, and safety egress systems (EES – Emergency Egress System) should the need to evacuate Starliner on the pad occur, was built offsite for transportation to LC-41 in between Atlas V missions. Beginning after the MUOS-3 launch in early 2015, pre-fabricated tiers of the tower were stacked at the pad in April. With all the tiers now assembled – along with the internal structure that includes an elevator – construction at the pad focused on the outboard steel. The final major piece of the tower is the crew access arm, tested at the Sauer Group, Inc.’s yard in Oak Hill, Florida, just north of the Cape Canaveral area. It has been transported to the launch site to be installed on the new structure in the coming days. Currently, media are expected to be invited over the weekend to celebrate its installation. After all, the milestone of installation will complete the major construction of the first new Crew Access Tower to be constructed along Florida’s Space Coast since the Apollo era. The integrated tower is estimated to be complete by mid-October, well before Starliner launches are set to take place in early 2018. Preparations for SLS Launches: While SLC-41 has gained additional structure, KSC’s Pad 39B has seen its complex reduced to a “clean pad”, allowing for the arrival of SLS on the Mobile Launcher. The ML is a complex rolling tower – transported to the pad via the modified Crawler Transporter – sporting an array of umbilicals and connections, most of which will be mated with the rocket and Orion spacecraft inside the Vehicle Assembly Building (VAB) High Bay, before rolling out to the pad. Testing of the numerous hardware elements – that will be installed on the ML – is ongoing at the Launch Equipment Test Facility (LETF). This historic test site is located just south of the Operations and Checkout (O&C) Building at the famous spaceport. The first major umbilical to be tested was the Orion Service Module Umbilical (OSMU) last summer. Over recent weeks, engineers have been preparing for the milestone of testing the Core Stage Forward Skirt Umbilical, or CSFSU. The CSFSU will be a T-0 umbilical requiring Vehicle Assembly Building (VAB) access for mating of the umbilical plate to the SLS rocket. Commodity lines for the CS FS will run through the stabilizer truss of the umbilical arm, with drape commodity lines extending from the arm to CS FS attach location. The umbilical plate will have dimensions of 46 inches by 34 inches. Testing was set to begin last week. However, poor weather moved the start of a test program on the umbilical into this week. Meanwhile, one of the Tail Service Mast units arrived at the LETF on the back of a flatbed truck. The SLS TSMs will use a pneumatic operated system to detach the umbilical plate from SLS, before retracting the umbilical carrier and closing the door to protect the umbilicals and connections from the exhaust of the SLS launch. This is an advance on the Shuttle TSMs, which used a drop weight for the retraction, released via pyrotechnic devices. Planning teams decided the pyro devices shouldn’t be used for SLS, which led to the decision to go to a pneumatic retraction system alternative. The size of the TSM provides a sign of the upgraded needs of the ML, with each device weighing in at 170,000 pounds. The Shuttle LH2 TSM weighed only 120,000 pounds. The LH2 TSM will be tested at Vehicle Motion Simulator -1 (VMS-1), while the LOX TSM is due in next month, and will go on VMS-2. They will spend the next three months or so hooking the devices to LETF services, ahead of testing in November. According to LETF testing notes (L2), a total of nine umbilical devices are currently in various stages of their testing ahead of being installed on the ML. Meanwhile, next door’s Pad 39A is continuing to be prepared for the debut launch of the SpaceX Falcon Heavy, which is expected to take place early in 2017. The former Shuttle launch complex is technically “pad active”, although work is continuing on items such as the hold down points.

Jetstar to ask GE to explain engine breakdown Source: Xinhua   2016-08-09 16:58:46 Xinhua Weibo Facebook Twitter Reddit Diigo Delicious Digg Linkedin MySpace Sina Weibo Kaixin Renren Q-zone Tencent Weibo Sohu Weibo NetEase Weibo SYDNEY, Aug. 9 (Xinhua) -- Australian low-cost airline Jetstar has asked aircraft engine manufacturer General Electric for an explanation after a near-new engine had to be shut down during a mid-air flight from Tokyo to Gold Coast. NewsCorp reported on Tuesday that the GEnx model engine fitted on a Boeing 787 had to be shut down after a warning light appeared indicating oil pressure problems on the flight on Sunday, prompting it to be diverted to Guam. Jetstar spokesman said the aircraft's engine had been installed three months ago to replace an engine of the same model that was only nine months' old. The older engine was repaired and put into another aircraft. The spokesman said it was unusual to have an issue like this so soon into the life of an aircraft engine adding that the airline had sought an explanation from the manufacturer on the matter. "Boeing 787s can fly safely on one engine," a Jetstar spokesman said. "GE (General Electric) has a team which is working with our engineers to understand what occurred," the spokesman said. This is not the first time an airline has been experiencing mid-air engine problems. In April, another 787, operated by Xiamen Airlines, had an engine shut down because of an oil pressure problem. And in February, an Air India 787 also switched off one engine after encountering problems. Despite the problems, Boeing 787s are designed to fly safely on one engine. A spokeswoman for GE declined to comment but said that the company was working with Jetstar on the matter. "We ... expect to know more in the next 24 hours," she told NewsCorp.

Sydney : MH370 plunged into the ocean at high speed, up to 20,000 feet a minute, reinforcing analysis that the missing Malaysia Airlines jet crashed in the current search zone, a report said Tuesday. The Boeing 777 disappeared on March 8, 2014 en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing with 239 people onboard. An extensive underwater hunt in the southern Indian Ocean has not yet found the crash site, fuelling speculation it may be outside the current search zone, particularly if someone was at the controls at the end of the flight. A manned plane could have been glided down, allowing it to enter the water outside the 120,000 square kilometre (46,000 square mile) area being searched, some experts have suggested. But extensive testing by aircraft manufacturer Boeing and new Australian defence department data analysis both suggest that regardless of the possible actions of one or both of the pilots the jet dived into the ocean at high speed, The Australian reported. Once MH370 ran out of fuel and the engines flamed, it slowed before plunging down towards the water in a series of swoops dropping from 35,000 feet at a rate of between 12,000 feet a minute and 20,000 feet a minute, Boeing said, according to the report. The sharp dive was confirmed by a new data analysis by Australia's defence department involving signals sent automatically between the plane and a satellite, the head of the agency leading the MH370 hunt said. Australian Transport and Safety Bureau chief Greg Hood said this supported the view MH370 "was likely to have crashed in the 120,000 square kilometre (46,000 square mile) area now being searched," the paper said. The area was defined under the ATSB's "most likely" scenario that no-one was at the controls and the plane ran out of fuel. "The Australians leading the search do not doubt that the pilot may well have been responsible for the jet's disappearance but they say critics of the search strategy are wrong to assume that means they are looking in the wrong place," the report added. Malaysian officials said last week that one of the pilots used a home-made flight simulator to plot a very similar course to MH370's presumed final route, but warned this did not prove he deliberately crashed the plane.

Malaysian officials said last week that one of the pilots used a home-made flight simulator to plot a very similar course to MH370’s presumed final route, but warned this did not prove he deliberately crashed the plane.

Several conspiracy theories surrounding the plane's disappearance have made the rounds over the last two years. The Australian reported, citing experts, that the Boeing 777-200 crashed in the Indian Ocean off Western Australia after running out of fuel. According to the experts, the plane’s left engine flamed out first and then the right went about 15 minutes later. Experts cited simulation tests by Boeing that showed the plane may have slowed and lost lift after it lost power to the engines. The plane’s nose may have dropped and it plunged downward where it may have gathered speed and lifted, and then fell down repeatedly before hitting the ocean. Greg Hood, the chief commissioner of the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB), which is leading the search for the missing plane, told the Australian that the pilot would not have been in control of the plane when it crashed. Hood said that new data also showed that Flight MH370 likely crashed in a 46,332 sq. mile area in a remote part of the southern Indian Ocean, where search crews have been looking for the jet for several months. Related Stories Weather Continues To Complicate MH370 Mission 'We Need To Find The Airplane' The new analysis report comes just a week after Malaysia refuted claims that the plane’s Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah “deliberately flew the plane into the Indian Ocean.” "Yes, he had simulated the flight path, but it is one of thousands of simulations to many parts of the world. We cannot, just based on this, confirm he did it,” Malaysian Transport Minister Liow Tiong Lai said. Flight MH370 went off radar more than two years ago with 239 people on board while on its way from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. A multimillion-dollar search for the missing plane has so far yielded no concrete clues as to what happened to the plane. Last week, Malaysia, China and Australia announced that they will be suspending the underwater search for Flight MH370 unless “credible new information” emerges. A flaperon found last year in the French-controlled Réunion Island in the Indian Ocean has been confirmed to be from the missing plane, following which five other parts this year have been said to be "likely" from the jet.

Weather Your 4-day local weather forecast Thursday November 24, 2016 Life & Style Travel Larger / SmallerNight Mode Singapore Airlines Airbus A350 arrives at Melbourne Airport for first time Craig Platt 10 Aug 2016, 8 p.m. Singapore Airlines' next-generation Airbus A350 has touched down in Australia for the first time, but be quick if you want to fly on it. Singapore Airlines' next-generation Airbus A350 has touched down in Australia for the first time. Flight SQ207 touched down at Melbourne Airport on Wednesday evening after flying in from the Asian city-state. The new A350-900 is Airbus' rival to the Boeing Dreamliner. Like its rival, the A350 is also a lightweight aircraft, but with some key differences. Unlike the Dreamliner, which has a body is composed primarily of carbon fibre, the A350 uses a combination of materials, including plastic reinforced by carbon fibre, along with titanium and aluminium alloys. More than 70 per cent of the aircraft is made of lightweight materials, helping airlines save on fuel. Singapore Airlines' A350 features three classes - 42 business class seats, 24 premium economy and 187 economy. The seat layout is 1-2-1 in business class, 2-4-2 in premium and 3-3-3 in economy. The airline currently has five A350s in its fleet and 62 on order. Singapore is the second carrier to bring the A350 to Australia, after Qatar Airways began daily flights from Qatar to Adelaide in May. Passengers looking to experience the A350 on the Melbourne-Singapore route will need to be quick - the new aircraft is only flying to Melbourne on a temporary basis. The A350 will fly between Melbourne and Singapore daily until October 22, before being redeployed on non-stop flights between Singapore and San Francisco from October 23. The A350-900 has a range of 8100 nautical miles (15,000km), but seven of Singapore Airlines' future A350s will be the ULR (ultra long range) variant, which Airbus says will be able to complete epic 19-hour long-haul journeys. The aircraft manufacturer says its A350 uses 25 per cent less fuel than Boeing's longest-range plane, the 777. Singapore has previously flagged that when it receives the ULR aircraft it will restart the world's longest commercial route, non-stop flights from Singapore to New York City. Emirates currently flies the world's longest route, from Dubai to Auckland non-stop. Follow the writer on Twitter and Instagram.

Aug 10, 2016 Inside MRO EMAIL Tweet Comments 0 Advertisement ASKY Airlines based in Lomé,Togo and shareholder, Ethiopian Airlines are planning to establish an aircraft MRO and training center in West Africa. This is a significant development as West Africa currently does not have any local stations capable of heavy maintenance. The International Aviation Group (IAG) and Arik Air may also seek to get a slice of the region’s MRO pie. Tewolde Gebremariam, CEO of Ethiopian Airlines, explained that ASKY was in discussions with the Togolese government and that if approved, the MRO facility will cater to Boeing and Bombardier aircraft. The training facility will train back-office staff and cabin crew. He said: "Our main MRO hub remains in Addis Ababa and [we] will have regional MRO hubs in Lomé, Lilongwe and Kigali [home to partner RwandAir]. Our planned Lomé MRO hub would maintain aircraft operating in Nigeria, Ghana, Côte d'Ivoire and Senegal.” IAG plans to establish an MRO facility in Abuja, Nigeria. This comes in the wake of local industry stakeholders berating the government for the lack of an MRO facility, which they claim is part of the reason for the high demand of foreign exchange in the industry, lack of developed technical manpower and the inability of Nigeria to carry out C-checks and D-checks. Yesterday (August 9) James Odaudu, deputy director, press and public affairs, at Nigeria’s ministry of aviation, said the venture was because IAG saw potential in the following factors: the huge traffic in and out of the country, the need to reduce the cost of maintaining aircraft abroad and the chance of attracting work from neighboring countries. In addition, IAG intends to start a Nigerian aviation academy that will be affiliated to a UK-based university. Lagos’ Arik Air has also been considering setting up its own MRO hangars in Nigeria in collaboration with its German partner, Lufthansa Technik.

The agency's Next Space Technologies for Exploration Partnerships (NextSTEP) program ask private companies to build ground-based prototypes of various modules, meeting a number of criteria from basic life support to fire safety tech and radiation mitigation. ground prototypes will allow NASA to test the habitats Six partners have been selected for the NextSTEP program, now in its second iteration. These include a number of familiar names from the US aerospace industry: Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Orbital ATK, Sierra Nevada Corporation’s Space Systems, Bigelow Aerospace, and Nanoracks. Some of these firms will be building habitation modules, while others will focus on communication infrastructure, propulsion systems, and other key aspects of deep space survival. Concept image of Boeing's prototype habitation module. (Image credit: Boeing) NASA is hoping these habitats will eventually be part of its crewed mission to Mars in the 2030s, an ambition that has occupied the space agency for the last six years. But before NASA sorts out living arrangements for this mission, it's going to need to make sure the rockets it uses are also up to scratch. A federal report on NASA's Mars mission released this month cast doubts on this, suggesting that the agency's Space Launch System rocket and Orion crew capsule won't meet their development schedules and that current launch dates for the rockets are overly ambitious. As with the most ambitious aerospace plans, whatever happens next, will happen slowly, playing out over years to come.

Zsolt Czegledi / EPA Airspace management is key to Arabian Gulf economy Ben Kiff August 10, 2016 Updated: August 10, 2016 08:20 PM Related Why US airlines are set to suffer more disruptions Abu Dhabi takes flight in next phase for aviation Abu Dhabi Airports Company celebrates 10th anniversary Congested airspace could cost Middle East $16 billion over next decade Gulf airlines remain at close quarters over open skies With the contract award of phase 3 of the UAE Airspace Restructuring Project to an international firm roughly two months ago, the UAE has taken a critical step forward in supporting aviation’s growth both in the country and the wider region. Airspace is the invisible pillar of every nation’s transport infrastructure and is a fundamental, if sometimes overlooked, building block for economies seeking growth and modernisation. For the UAE, which boasts one of the world’s highest aviation growth rates, investment in airspace management is of paramount importance. Passenger traffic through Dubai International Airport exceeded 78 million people last year, and the airport led the world in the number of international passengers. The total economic impact of the aviation sector in Dubai alone was US$26.7 billion in 2013, the most recent year for which figures are available; this is equivalent to 8.1 per cent of Dubai’s total GDP and 416,500 jobs, or 21 per cent of total employment. By 2020 it is expected to be US$31.4bn,. This will support 449,500 jobs – 17.6 per cent of total employment. Regionally, the number of passengers transported by GCC carriers has more than tripled in the past decade to 150 million, and according to Boeing, air traffic in the GCC is expected to grow by 6.2 per cent a year over the next 20 years. The current vitality of the sector and the ability to attain these lofty – but reachable – goals must not be taken for granted. A report commissioned last year by Nats and produced by Oxford Economics showed that unless changes are implemented in airspace management, the region can expect a $16.3bn loss of economic growth caused by increased delays to flights resulting from insufficient air traffic capacity, management and staffing. This loss can be avoided if the right measures are put in place early enough. Governments in the region should look to public-private partnerships to play a role in the collaborative development of the region’s airspace, alongside airlines, airports, governments and civil and military authorities. A key area where these partnerships can help is in enabling the most efficient use of military airspace. Half of the airspace in the GCC is exclusively for military use. Through partnerships with leading private firms, new technologies can be deployed to help the UAE and other GCC countries expand the flexible use of this airspace while still maintaining critical national security. Just last month the company for which I work, Nats, announced an agreement with the Japan Air Navigation Service, paving the way for a joint approach to air traffic management in Japanese civil and military airspace above the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games. It will require crucial collaboration and cooperation between civil and military authorities, which will promote aviation-led economic development while ensuring national security in a complex and evolving geopolitical environment. It will also enable better use of the airspace, which will directly benefit all stakeholders, inbound and outbound travellers, and wider society. The United Kingdom is an example of a country with a long history of successfully integrating civil and military operations, where air-traffic management companies work side-by-side with military controllers to manage the airspace in the most optimal way. It is therefore encouraging to see that the UAE’s General Civil Aviation Authority has created this type of partnership to implement a road map to restructure the UAE’s airspace through phase 3 of the UAE Airspace Restructuring Project. This is certainly a significant step in the right direction, but it is also important that these partnerships tackle wider issues such as developing the skills of our local workforce; well-trained people remain at the heart of any sustain­able strategy for the successful growth of aviation in the region. Nats, through strategic partnerships with local government entities, has helped to train nationals across the region, including the training and qualification of 115 Omani engineers. With nationalisation rates as low as 20 per cent in some countries, it is crucial that any air traffic management strategy includes comprehensive training programmes for nationals to ensure that they are able to fill the positions that are key to their nation’s strategies for economic growth and diversification.

An MoU was signed by Air India Engineering Services CEO H R Jagannath and Spicejet vice president Arun Kashyap in the presence of top AI officials here on Tuesday. With the signing of the agreement, Spicejet will send its aircraft from the fleet of 42 planes to Nagpur MRO in immediate future, Kashyap told reporters during their visit to the MRO. Kashyap also said Spicejet was in the process of acquiring 100 more aircraft in the days to come. He said the first Spicejet aircraft was expected to roll in for MRO facility within two months. It was already sending its aircraft to GMR, Hyderabad, but now onwards, Spicejet will be using the MRO facility of Air India at Nagpur, he said. Jagannath said after being formally handed over by aircraft manufacturer major Boeing International on December 29, 2014, the MRO started its maintenance operation from March this year and so far handled eight aircraft, while the ninth aircraft was on the pit. Spread over 50 acres of land adjacent to Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar International Airport, the Rs 600 crore MRO, which is connected by a 3.5 km taxiway, offers a world class facility. It is carrying out maintenance facility of all types including 'D' check of wide bodied aircraft which is mandatory for an aircraft after flying for 3,000 days. A team of dedicated engineers and technicians are positioned to carry out a detailed maintenance of Boeing aircraft to make it air worthy. The construction work of the MRO, funded by Boeing, commenced in March 2011 and completed in a record period of 3.5 years.

The airline’s “Pride of Africa” slogan rang uncomfortably hollow when the 26.22-billion-shilling (US$259-million) loss was announced, driven by higher borrowing costs and unfavourable exchange rates. Kenya Airways, founded in 1977 following the demise of East African Airways, was considered a cash cow just a decade ago, but is now floundering, said independent analyst Aly-Khan Satchu. “In the history of Kenya, no other listed company has ever recorded such an important loss,” Satchu said. A misguided expansion strategy launched in 2011 is the root of the catastrophic state of the firm, a move that called for the purchase of new Boeing planes with the objective of doubling the size of its network. But since then the Ebola virus and terror attacks on the continent have decimated Africa’s tourist numbers, while rivals such as state-owned Ethiopian Airlines and Qatar Airways have boosted their offerings. The firm has also lost out on rock-bottom fuel prices. Like many airlines, it “hedges” its fuel costs by entering into fixed-price contracts. But Kenya Airways was locked into longer-term contracts than most of its competitors, which gained a competitive advantage as fuel prices have plunged since mid-2014. Foreign currency “and fuel hedging are exceptional items, yes, but a company like KQ (Kenya Airways) should be able to deal with this,” said Satchu about the airline’s latest results. To the dismay of Kenya Airways’ two biggest backers — Air France-KLM and the Kenyan government — the firm’s share price has dropped from 140 shillings in 2006 to 3.85 shillings. The company’s debts exceed a billion US dollars. GETS RID OF HEATHROW SLOT Despite the gloom, analysts still see some cause for optimism in the numbers. Revenue was up five per cent and operating losses shrank thanks to a series of shock treatments imposed on the airline by management last year. “The operational result is what I’ll take from the latest results,” said Eric Musau, analyst at Kenya’s Standard Investment Bank. “KQ is on the right track, even if they could do a bit more in terms of assets sales,” he told AFP, describing the net loss as largely down to exceptional factors. A number of structural changes are beginning to show fruit. Kenya Airways has sold or rented out planes that were sitting idle, reducing its fleet size by a third, and has rid itself of an expensive permanent landing slot at London’s Heathrow airport, opting to rent one instead. What is at stake is more than just cash. “It is a matter of national and geopolitical interest for Kenya to have a national carrier. You can’t be the economic leader of the East African region if you don’t have a national carrier,” emphasised Satchu. “I wonder whether Kenya’s shoulders are broad enough to rescue KQ again and again. Kenya is not a country like UAE or Qatar,” which underwrite world-class airlines such as Qatar Airways, he added. Kenya Airways’ pilots have had a particularly fraught relationship with management, which at one point suggested they could be lent on occasion to rapidly growing Ethiopian Airlines. Protests and strikes followed and the idea was abandoned, but the firm still has to deal with a bloated workforce left over from the disastrous expansion plan. The fleet and those who fly it are in the sights of chief executive Mbuvi Ngunze. “The first thing that we are doing now is making sure that we get our business at the right size in order to grow responsibly, and that right size is both revenue and costs,” he said. Ngunze announced in March the airline will cut 600 jobs out of its 4,000-strong workforce. ADVERTISEMENT POST A COMMENT HOUSE RULES   1. We welcome reader comments on the top stories of the day.

Multimedia Today's Paper Topics ePaper WealthCheck SEARCH Follow Home News Markets Companies Money & Banking Economy Info-tech Opinion Specials Portfolio Catalyst BLink Agri Business Logistics Macro Economy Policy Air India’s Nagpur MRO to service SpiceJet aircraft Rahul Wadke   ·   print   ·   T+  ·   T- Tweet The Hindu File Photo of one of Air India’s maintenance repair overhaul (MRO) facilities A source of revenue for national carrier’s under-used facility Mumbai, August 10:   Air India has finally found better use for its ₹600-crore maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) facility at the Multi-modal International Cargo Hub and Airport at Nagpur (MIHAN). The national air carrier has entered into an agreement with SpiceJet for maintaining the latter's’ aircraft. Both the companies have signed an MoU under which Air India will provide support to SpiceJet for the maintenance of the latter’s B737 aircraft and landing gear replacement at the Nagpur facility. The MoU was signed by Air India Engineering Services CEO HR Jagannath and SpiceJet Vice-President (Engineering and Maintenance) Arun Kashyap. Revenue source A senior engineer at Air India said on condition of anonymity that the MRO is currently under-utilised, and that the tie-up with SpiceJet will provide some revenue to Air India. In the mid-2000s, when Air India had placed an order for 68 aircraft with Boeing, it had committed to setting up an MRO in India for servicing the aircraft. Boeing had built the facility for Air India and it was operational by 2015. Kashyap told BusinessLine that the MRO has been newly built with the latest infrastructure and is therefore better equipped to handle SpiceJet’s aircraft — carrying out the airframe checks that every aircraft needs to undergo every 24 to 36 months. Engine overhaul will not be carried out at MIHAN, he added. Both the companies will work on each other’s strengths, Kashyap added. Since Air India has better experience in terms of maintenance, major checks will happen at Nagpur. SpiceJet does not require full facility, so about two bays will be used for aircraft maintenance. Supply of spares SpiceJet’s aircraft are currently maintained in Hyderabad and Hosur, but Air India will be able to supply the spares at Nagpur in a better manner, he said. On the issue of viability of taking aircraft to Nagpur, Kashyap said that since the city has a functional airport, it can be worked out such that the aircraft fly with a passenger load. Cost factor SpiceJet is working on the costs required for using the facility. Under the new aviation policy, MRO services do not have to pay VAT and service tax, which would be advantageous to SpiceJet, he said. MIHAN is being developed for the past 11 years by the State government through Maharashtra Airport Development Company Ltd (MADC), a special purpose vehicle. The main MIHAN site, spread over 4,000 hectares, is located about 15 km away from downtown Nagpur. The airport, MRO, SEZ and other manufacturing areas are closely located. It was originally envisaged as a Multi-modal International Cargo Hub for servicing global cargo companies and their aircraft. Union Shipping Minister Nitin Gadkari had provided a major push to the project. Under the new aviation policy, MRO services do not have to pay VAT and service tax, which would be advantageous to SpiceJet, said SpiceJet Vice-President (Engineering and Maintenance) Arun Kashyap.

Mr Trump included a call for a 15% corporate rate in a Detroit speech where he outlined other tax and economic reforms. Business groups have long said their members are hurt because US companies pay the most federal income tax — a 35% rate, though the effective rate is often lower — among the 35 countries in the OECD. “The fact that he is pushing for a 15% corporate tax rate is definitely a positive,” said Dorothy Coleman, vice-president of tax and domestic economic policy for the National Association of Manufacturers. READ NEXT Firms lose Luas court appeal “Tax reform is really one of the important goals that we have.” The Rate Coalition, which lists Boeing, Ford, and Wal-Mart among corporate supporters, said it will not endorse all aspects of Mr Trump’s plan but that the tax proposal is a “huge step in the right direction and we urge other candidates in the race to follow his lead”. Mr Trump also called for a 10% levy on overseas cash that companies have been unwilling to bring home because of high US taxes. For small businesses, the proposal was a “home run”, said Juanita Duggan, chief executive of the National Federation of Independent Business. It would provide the same 15% rate for companies no matter their size, freeing up funds to invest back into family businesses, she said. The US last adjusted its corporate tax in 1993 when it was pushed up by a percentage point to 35%, said Alan Cole, an economist with the Tax Foundation’s Center for Federal Tax Policy. Under a 1986 tax bill, the rate was phased down to 34% from 46%. Countries around the world have been ratcheting down their tax rate steadily to become more competitive, said Mr Cole. The average corporate tax rate when including state levies and weighted by the size of economy has declined to about 29% from 36% in 2003. The US corporate tax when including state levies is about 39%, according to the OECD. The US Chamber of Commerce did not issue a statement on the Trump speech and referred questions to a video that calls for lower rates and a globally competitive system. The manufacturers association still wants to see more particulars on Mr Trump’s plan, as well as more incentive for capital spending and research and development, said Mr Coleman, adding: “The devil is in the details on this.” READ MORE Visit the section home page here READ NEXT Firms lose Luas court appeal KEYWORDS business, finance, economy, us, donald trump, corporate tax, tax © Irish Examiner Ltd.

Low 33F. Winds NW at 10 to 15 mph. Updated: November 23, 2016 @ 1:15 pm Full Forecast Obits Opinion Local Crime & Courts Classifieds Sports Hidden cronyism bolsters Elon Musk Andrew F. Quinlan InsideSources.com Aug 9, 2016 A historically slow recovery with weak economic growth has created enough economic angst to fuel multiple populist, outsider campaigns this election season. At least one apparent bright spot in the economy, however, is the near-record high profits being recorded by U.S. corporations, which in turn has sent the stock market to record highs.   But there’s reason to question even that, as a growing share of corporate profits are being derived from lobbying and favorable regulations — cronyism — instead of productive contributions to the economy.  According to research recently reported in Harvard Business Review by economist James Bessen, “since 2000, political activity and regulation account for a surprisingly large share of the increase” in corporate valuations and profits. Corporations have always been able to game the system and benefit from special carve-outs from both politicians and regulators, but the problem seems to be getting worse.  Consider iconic modern industrialist Elon Musk. While generally viewed as a visionary tech entrepreneur, Musk has also mastered the art of using government to benefit his corporate interests.  The PayPal co-founder has a variety of ventures in emerging sectors, including solar energy collection, electrical vehicle production, and space exploration. It’s an inspiring list, but in each field he has benefited heavily from taxpayer support. In total his three companies have received an estimated $4.9 billion in subsidies, according to the Los Angeles Times, plus billions more in government contracts.  The latest example involves his SpaceX, which made headlines earlier this year for successfully landing one of its Falcon 9 rockets at sea. A very respectable achievement, but less commendable is the backroom Washington dealing on the company’s behalf that could  pave the way for SpaceX to secure lucrative defense contracts without competition. At the behest of Sen. John McCain, this year’s National Defense Authorization Act includes an amendment worth billions for SpaceX and Musk.  Currently a joint venture between Lockheed Martin and Boeing called the United Launch Alliance produces the rockets used for launching defense satellites into orbit. ULA buys the engines for their rockets from Russia, which McCain and Musk — who previously sued over the issue — argue is reason to restrict ULA from fulfilling the remainder of its contract.  The Russian engines are widely acknowledged as reliable, and were even created at the behest of the United States as it sought to keep Russian scientists employed in respectable fields instead of selling secrets to rogue nations. Rockets using domestic alternatives are currently either too expensive or, in the case of SpaceX, not yet capable of carrying sufficient loads into orbit.  Most important, the director of National Intelligence and top military officials have testified that continuing to use rockets from ULA, even with Russian engines, best serves our national security interests until domestically sourced alternatives are ready for use.  Ultimately, McCain was forced to compromise on his demands to end immediately procurement of ULA rockets and instead set a cut-off date of 2022. Maybe SpaceX will be ready to step in at that time with reliable rockets powered by domestically built engines, or maybe it won’t. But there’s no legitimate reason for Congress to limit its options at this time except as part of a crony deal paving the way for Musk alone to bid on supplying the rockets. The better approach would be to keep as many eligible to compete as possible and let the best bidder win.  McCain’s amendment is just one of many benefits Musk has managed to wrangle for his companies. Tesla not only got a federal loan guarantee to manufacture its electrical vehicles but purchases are subsidized through tax credits. SolarCity gets a similar combination of subsidies and customer tax credits for its solar panels.  SpaceX even got taxpayer backed loans from the cronyism-enabling Export-Import Bank. Ex-Im’s chairman justified the support with the perplexing claim that SpaceX is a “small business” despite employing 4,000 people. Last year’s purchase of a 10 percent stake in SpaceX by Google and Fidelity also shows it has no problem raising capital on its own without taxpayer support.  None of this is to say that Musk has made no legitimate economic contributions, but rather that his companies have profited at least in part thanks to the largess of politicians, and not due to market forces alone. At a time when wages for most of the very taxpayers funding those handouts remain stagnant, that's a tough pill to swallow.  Andrew F. Quinlan is the co-founder and president of the Center for Freedom and Prosperity, which promotes free-market ideas.

The lawsuits, filed Aug. 9 in different federal courts, accuse the universities of charging excessive record-keeping and administrative fees in connection with their retirement plans for faculty members. The complaints raise a novel challenge to the way the retirement plans are managed — namely, that the plans included too many duplicative and unnecessary investment options, which caused investors to suffer from “decision paralysis” and interfered with the ability of plan fiduciaries to negotiate lower fees. Lawsuits over retirement plan fees have come at a rapid-fire pace since 2015, when the U.S. Supreme Court affirmed the duty of plan fiduciaries to monitor investments on an ongoing basis and largely eliminated a key defense to these types of lawsuits. That year also saw several high-profile settlements in plan fee cases brought by Schlichter, including a $57 million deal with Boeing Co., a $62 million settlement with Lockheed Martin Corp. and a $32 million agreement with Novant Health Inc. Allegations. The lawsuits take issue with the number of investment options offered in each university’s retirement plans — which allegedly ranged between 84 and 340, with multiple options in each asset class. According to the complaints, a reasonable number of investment options for a large retirement plan is closer to 15. “Defendant provided a dizzying array of duplicative funds in the same investment style, thereby losing the bargaining power associated with offering a single option in each investment style, which significantly reduces investment fees, and causing ‘decision paralysis’ for participants,” the employees suing NYU alleged in their complaint. The lawsuits challenge other aspects of the retirement plans, including: the use of higher-fee retail share classes when lower-fee options were allegedly available; annual record-keeping fees that allegedly ranged from $170 to $340 per participant; and the retention of historically underperforming investment funds. In the cases against Yale and NYU, employees attack the decisions to use multiple record keepers, instead of a single record keeper that they say could have provided lower fees. The lawsuit against MIT takes aim at the university’s relationship with Boston-based Fidelity Investments, which served as the plan’s record keeper and provided many of the plan’s investment options. In particular, the lawsuit accuses MIT of giving its business to Fidelity without conducting regular competitive bidding processes. The employees say this stemmed from the university’s personal ties with Fidelity and its chief executive officer, Abigail Johnson, who has served on MIT’s board of trustees since 2007. According to the complaints, each university controls more than $3 billion in retirement plan assets for the benefit of thousands of plan participants. University Reaction. NYU spokesman John Beckman told Bloomberg BNA in an Aug. 9 e-mail that the university expects to prevail in the lawsuit filed against it. “NYU only first saw the papers a very short while ago this morning, so we cannot comment at length,” Beckman said. “But it seems worth noting that, first, NYU’s plans have comparatively low fees; second, decisions about our retirement plan choices are influenced by feedback from our faculty and other employees; and, third, that the named plaintiffs in this case notably include several faculty members who recently lost unrelated court cases they brought against NYU.” “NYU takes seriously the welfare of our faculty and employees — including a dignified retirement — and the retirement plans offered to them are chosen and administered carefully and prudently,” Beckman continued. “We will litigate this case vigorously and expect to prevail.” Kimberly Allen, director of media relations for MIT, declined Bloomberg BNA’s request for comment on the lawsuit, citing a general policy against discussing pending litigation. Yale didn’t immediately respond to Bloomberg BNA’s inquiries. The cases are: Vellali v. Yale Univ., D. Conn., No. 3:16-cv-01345, complaint filed 8/9/16; Sacerdote v. N.Y. Univ., S.D.N.Y., No. 1:16-cv-06284, complaint filed 8/9/16; and Tracey v. Mass. Inst. of Tech., D. Mass., No. 1:16-cv-11620-NMG, complaint filed 8/9/16.

Here’s a final roundup of reader stories. Gerry had a short but psychologically endless voyage at the Happiest Place on Earth: I have DEEP psychic scars from being stuck for an hour on the Disneyland “Small World” ride when it broke down … but the music did not. Thank god this next reader, Nick, wasn’t stranded on that ride: For three months back in 2007, a companion and I traveled dirt-cheap all around India. My Midwestern GI tract performed admirably well, save for one surreal moment on an overnight, long-haul, toilet-less sleeper bus that found me hanging my rear out the window performing my first “flying toilet.” Only problem was, the bag was too small for the task at hand, leaving me to assault the roadside (and, it turned out, the side of the bus) at god knows how many kilometers per hour. To my everlasting horror, I realized at the next rest stop that the occupant below me was fast asleep next to his open window. A flying toilet would have been much more difficult for this reader: I started feeling sick six hours before my flight was scheduled to leave Nairobi, but I convinced myself it was nothing serious. A half hour or so into the flight, I was hit with the worst-imaginable stomach cramps. A cramp would hit, and I’d curl up in a ball for a few seconds of relief. Then another cramp would hit, and I’d stretch as much as I could for a few seconds of relief, etc., etc. Continue Reading The steward saw I was in distress (I was lying on the floor by then) and announced in business class that there was a sick person in coach who needed more room and asked for a volunteer to trade seats. Miracle! A kind person swapped his/her large, comfortable, expensive seat for my tiny one. I don’t know how I would have survived the 12-hour flight to London if I hadn’t been able to stretch out. I was too out of it to ask who the person was, but I am eternally grateful for his/her compassion. I had an 18-hour layover in London, where the bedrest revived me enough to make it to Chicago and finally home to Portland, where I was diagnosed with typhoid fever.   Courtney had a helluva time meeting new family: In 2007 I was studying in Europe for graduate school. I had about a month off around Christmas to do whatever I please. My mom is from Germany originally and I, at 26, had never met my grandpa, aunts, and uncles. So when I randomly called my grandpa asking if I could visit for Christmas, I got more than an enthusiastic yes. As I was leaving Amsterdam to head to Munich, a snowstorm invaded and I missed my connecting flight in Copenhagen. But I was quickly booked on the next flight out to Munich, although my luggage didn’t make it. About an hour before landing the pilot made an announcement that the wheels were frozen in the aircraft and we were unable to land. We were descending and you could visibly feel the wheels try to force themselves out. The pilot, however, insisted we would make the landing in the second attempt. WOMP!—that's the sound the landing gear made as it sadly failed at trying to come out the second time. Whoosh!—the plane takes off again midair while I notice the mother to my right reading the emergency evacuation to her children. Then the pilot informs us it’s just too cold and we’re going to have to land in Stuttgart. We do. But then the whole plane has to board a bus and trek to Munich for four hours. I can’t call my grandpa—who, remind you, I am meeting for the first time—so I borrow a random phone to let him know what’s going on. In the end, I make it to Munich at 5am to a more-than-happy-to-meet-me grandpa. Talk about making a great first impression! But my luggage didn’t for another three days. Not as awkward as this first visit to meet German relatives: Here’s one last reader, Nicole, who ends on an uplifting note: I left town on a whim. No planning, no expectations—and most importantly, as always—no traveling companion. Just me, my thoughts, my desires, and my money. On Thursday afternoon during my lunch hour, I booked a room downtown in Montreal, just off Saint Catherine. On Friday after work, I headed north out of Vermont. Immediately upon my arrival, I noticed a wild party in the center square, Place Émilie-Gamelin. House music, flashing lights, half-dressed men in leather—Holy stroke of luck! Fierté Montréal! Gay Pride weekend! Just need to drop off my bags! A block to the hotel, and … The front desk attendant spoke only French. We flung incomprehensible words at each other until we landed on one we both understood: “Reservation?” “Yes! Yes, I have a reservation!” I replied. “Nom de famille?” she asked. I showed her my credit card to display my name. She looked at me and shook her head. “Un moment,” she said as she picked up the telephone. She spoke a few sentences in French to the person on the other line, and then handed me the phone. “Hello?” “Nicola?” said the masculine voice on the other line. “Yes?” “Sorry. We did not think you were coming. We cancel your reservation.” “What? Cancelled? WHY?” “Check-in is 3.” “So it’s MANDATORY check in at 3.” “Sorry, cancelled. If you would like to rebook, it’s $390.” “$390? My original reservation was for $265.” “Yes, but now this is late booking. Price increased.” I was decidedly irritated. But honestly, what could I do? I was in another country, it was Pride weekend, and I had no internet or cell phone. “Fine. $390.” “And you need to pay cash.” “Cash? I don’t HAVE cash. I only have a credit card on me. I barely just arrived in the country.” “You can use the cash machine to take money,” he said. “If you want to use credit card, there is an additional 10%, so it will be $429.” “Ok, no. Cash it is. I just need to find an ATM.” I walked a block away, found an ATM, withdrew $500, and returned to the hotel. “$395.” “$395? You just told me $390.” “$5 charge for the room key.” “I am alone, I don’t need an extra room key.” “Each key is $5.” “So the room comes with ZERO room keys? How would I get into the room I paid for without the key?” She shrugged her shoulders, “Sorry. No English.” Frustrated, I paid the $395, took the key and headed to my room. I put my bags down. The room was, not unsurprisingly, unkempt. Ok. Scam or not, I have no recourse for action. I have two choices here, and justice AIN’T one of them: So I can either let this ruin my trip, OR I can shake it off and just roll with it. “I choose the latter,” I thought. Many people would have argued persistently. Maybe they’d have won the room at the lower charge. Maybe not. Maybe they’d have told the front desk to get lost and tried to find another hotel. Maybe they’d have ended up spending even more money. Maybe they’d have just driven right back home. But the frustration and anger would settle on them and envelope them. And in that moment, I realized how lucky I actually am to be a person who CAN choose to shake things off. I CAN choose to be happy. And even in unjustified defeat, ultimately the ability to choose happiness is the greater reward in life. Chris Bodenner 5:15 PM / August 5, 2016 'The Interstates Turned Into a Skating Rink' A reader writes: In 1998 I drove from Austin to southern Illinois in my ‘89 Dodge Ramcharger truck. I started running into freezing rain outside of Dallas, going over Ray Hubbard Reservoir, and decided to keep going. Rather than getting better, it got worse—all the way through Texarkana and beyond. The interstates turned into a skating rink and still I kept going. The drive usually takes 15 hours, but by the time I made it 15 hours, I was only in central Arkansas. Traffic was going by at a crawl when a commercial truck passed everyone in the left lane at 35-40 mph, left the highway, and went nose-first—hard—into the median’s ravine. I stopped to check on the two guys in the truck, and one had hit his chest on the steering wheel and was not in good shape, shocky, and coughing blood. Of course nobody had cell phones, and nobody else stopped to help but me. Via sign language, I was finally able to get someone to call the state police as they drove by. The temps were in the teens and the wind was blowing at 30 mph, so I got the two guys in my truck, blasted the heater, and kept the one guy talking so he wouldn’t go unconscious. State troopers showed up, I had to fill out a statement, and I immediately went looking for a motel before they all filled up with other refugees from I-40. I stayed in a motel that wasn’t much more than a set of prefabs: a bed, a TV, a bathroom, a radio and some paneling. By that point, it was the best motel I had ever seen. The next day, when I got going again, there was a big rig in the median about every five miles. Worst driving conditions I ever traveled in.

Chris Bodenner 1:53 PM / August 4, 2016 Hug-Mugged in Ecuador A reader had a night in the capital city he’ll never forget: Back in 2008, after completing college, I went on a backpacking trip through South America. Best time I ever had. But it didn’t end well. I was in Quito, Ecuador, and I returned late to my youth hostel after getting lost. I’m a rather huge fellow, so I wasn’t much nervous about it. While standing outside the place waiting for the receptionist to wake up, two ladies approached me—and wrapped themselves around me. They did so not because of my immense allure, but rather to pickpocket me. After I felt my phone leave my pocket, I caught a hold of one of the señoras demanding it back. She took out a can of pepper spray and gave me a long extended blast to my face. So, I lost my phone. And my eyes were melting. I inhaled quite a bit of the spray, so my airway was burning. I was screaming. It didn’t end there. While stumbling around screaming and crying, I tripped over something and broke my ankle. And to cap it all, I had an allergic reaction and spent some time in a not-so-lovely hospital. As a result, I missed my flight home. And upon coming back, I discovered that my insurance claim was denied. My family still thought I was the one at fault. I still love Ecuador though. Been there twice since. Have you ever been mugged on vacation? Drop us a note and we’ll post. Update from Chris, whose terrible travel experience ended up being the best thing ever: Continue Reading I was traveling through Europe, with a plan to hang in Sevilla for a few years, or until the military junta in Burma collapsed under the strain of international sanctions and the Nobel Peach Prize that had just been awarded to Aung San Suu Kyi (this was 1991). I decided to stop in Barcelona for a few days en route to Sevilla, so I could get a sense of the city before moving on. My first night there, I was sitting on a bench on las Ramblas, watching people go by, when a guy tapped me on the shoulder and asked me if I knew where the statue of Columbus was. As it turned out, it was probably the only site I’d seen, so I pointed out where it was. Of course, while doing this, his accomplice was making off with my bag, which contained my passport and a journal I’d been keeping for several years while traveling. Shit. Next day, I went to the consulate to apply for a new passport, which I was told would take about a week. Since I’d be stuck in Barcelona for a week, I decided to call a guy whom I’d met in the Copper Canyon of Mexico several years earlier. We’d only hung out for an afternoon, but he’d given me his sister’s phone number and told me to give her a ring if I was ever in Barcelona, as she’d know where he was. I called and explained as best I could that I knew Marcos. She said, “He’s right here, hold on.” Long story short, Marcos took it upon himself to share all the best parts of Barcelona with me: his friends, his favorite spots, hikes in the Pyrenees. By the time my new passport arrived, someone had offered me a job, someone else rented me a room in his flat, and I had met a few women whom I definitely wanted to know better ... Twenty-five years later, I’m still based in Barcelona and am grateful to those thieves. Chris Bodenner 10:45 AM / August 3, 2016 Flying Into Teguci-Gulp-a Reader Adam recalls his worst travel experience: I was going back to Honduras after my honeymoon. I had a connecting flight in Miami. I went to get my bags to get through customs. They hadn’t made it yet. I couldn’t miss my flight, so off I went. Flying into Tegucigalpa was frightening, to say the least. We were all over the sky. I later found out it’s one of the worst airports to fly into. We landed safely on the ground once the pilot figured out how to pull this off. Once at the airport I came to the realization that my bags had been kept in Miami. Everything I bought on the honeymoon was lost. Here’s a bit more about Tegucigalpa’s Toncontin Airport, according to a Popular Mechanics list of the 10 most dangerous airports in the world: Aircraft have to skirt around the mountains of the interior highlands to land in a valley 3,294 feet above sea level. On approach, airliners as big as Boeing 757s make a 45-degree bank to effectively reach the 7000-foot runway with well above average rates of descent. Winds require pilots to compensate while hustling their aircraft in a zig-zag path over the terrain. Departures require high rates of climb to clear the nearby peaks. And the very worst airport to fly into? Conde Nast Traveler says it’s the one in Lukla, Nepal. That airport is featured several times in this long compilation of dicey landings: Have you ever had a harrowing landing, or an emergency situation on a plane? Drop us a note and we’ll post. *** Continue Reading Update from Paul Blackburn, who sends a great photo flying above Guatemala: Attached is a photo I took while on a medical transport in a Lear Jet Model 35, flown by REVA, an air ambulance/transport company based out of Ft. Lauderdale, Florida, and our branch base in Phoenix, Arizona. I was the physician on the flight, and we were banking onto final approach to the primary airport in Guatemala City, Guatemala. We were between a lower level of clouds and a higher scud layer of clouds. As we banked, I noted what I thought to be a mountain protruding through the clouds. On closer inspection, one can see that the “mountain” I briefly saw was actually a volcano, actively emitting steam and/or ash (this is apparently its usual baseline status): Chris Bodenner 6:00 PM / August 1, 2016 When Bad Weather Drowns a Business Deal Reader Greg recalls a terrible, horrible, no good, very bad work trip: Back in 1999 I’m in Zurich trying to get to Brussels for an extremely important seminar that I, as a self-employed consultant, had arranged with a Fortune 500 client. It’s my introduction to their senior management from all over Europe. A huge potential contract is in the balance. Gulp. It’s mid-August and I’m delayed three hours in a sweltering airport then two hours on a sweltering plane waiting on the tarmac for air travel in Western Europe to get over afternoon thunderstorms. I eventually fly to Amsterdam, then I’m driven to Brussels, in the heat and rain, in a full mid-size Mercedes, me middle front. Terrifying. No sleep possible. I arrived in a Brussels hotel at 4:30am. No reservation in my name. No mention of the company I was there for. No normal rooms. I rented an extended-stay suite (very nice) for 90 minutes—enough time to shower, change, and stare at the wall, thinking WTF. No one from the company is at breakfast. I don’t have anyone’s cell phone numbers. At 9am I finally contact a person in the Brussels office. “Oh, two days ago we moved the meetings to a hotel by the airport. Didn’t anyone tell you?" It was supposed to start at 8am. I arrived just after 10am, introduced myself, and started my spiel. I had to finish by noon, but my head was spinning so fast and I kept wanting to faint, so I had to lose another 15 minutes for breaks. Europe was not impressed. I was able to keep my existing work for them going, but I lost out on the huge contract. Ever have a work trip from hell? Drop us a note. Chris Bodenner 1:15 PM / August 1, 2016 'Oysters Are Still the Only Food I Won’t Eat' A reader tries to recall his worst travel experience: Let’s see, the 153AM out of Grand Central can be pretty lively, as can the first train in the morning on Sunday. Taking an overnight train in Vietnam was overrated, as it was dirty, uncomfortable, and sized for Vietnamese people. I’ve had my share of cancellations and so on, including get stuck in Denver overnight a few times, but that’s nothing unusual. My worst experience though, was flying from LA to Chicago when everyone on the plane got food poisoning, which incapacitated the pilots. It forced a fighter pilot turned taxi driver to conquer his fear of flying and save everyone on the plane. Surely he can’t be serious. This reader gets real: It’s about two weeks after 9/11 and I had been saving up for a year to travel through SE Asia to visit a friend who was working for a NGO in [Burma’s capital of] Yangon. Despite the security concerns over terrorism, I had already cleared off time at work, I was broke, and there was NO WAY I was canceling this trip. As expected, there are no “formal” travel restrictions in place, but the airports/border control are making damn sure that it’s really, really hard to travel. Essentially, it’s just a complete cluster and I’m already regretting my decision to save a little cash by flying out of Vancouver, BC instead of Seattle. Not only do I have trouble at the [Canadian border crossing in Blaine, Washington,] because the crappy Sanford & Son bus that picked us up from the sketchy part of downtown was over four hours late, but the (usually affable) Canadian agents are not happy with the quality of passengers on our bus. Many, many hours later (and a forfeited hotel room I secured for the previous evening), I made my way to the airport because it was too late to try to get a few hours of sleep. Surprisingly, I’m on a great flight to Hong Kong with no issues! Continue Reading Then I hopped a connection to Bangkok, where I would have to wait until the following morning for my flight to Yangon. Bangkok has a shiny new airport now, but in 2001, Don Mueang really wasn’t somewhere one would choose to spend time on purpose. There’s an on-site “hotel” so I figured I’d just stay there. Between the fighting/screaming from the couple in the next room (paper-thin walls), the random men who kept trying to ram their way into my room (the door barely locked), and the non-functioning lights (only light bulb in the room, about 20 watts), I may as well have just chained my bag to a chair and slept on the airport floor because I didn’t sleep a wink. I had a great time while I was in Burma (a scary-as-hell flight on Yangon Airways notwithstanding), but on the way home I reversed my route and spent some time in Bangkok at a friend-of-a-friend’s apartment while she was out of the country (nice!), and finished my trip back in Hong Kong. My NGO friend knew people in HK and one guy took me to dinner at the restaurant on top of Victoria Peak (touristy, but a great view). We decided to splurge and get some oysters because I was heading home soon, in four days. Do you know that feeling when you eat something and you know—right then and there—that it's bad? Well, that happened just as I was swallowing one of the oysters ... and it was too late. I figured I’d been building an iron constitution with all of the street cart food I’d been eating for the last couple weeks, so I wasn’t that worried. I went back to my hotel and right on cue: vomiting, chills, fever, that weird “I have food poisoning buzzing feeling,” and um ... spending some time in the bathroom. I took turns sweating out the sheets in the two single beds that were in my room, while each morning (like clockwork), a woman would bang on my door and yell: Day 1 Housekeeping: “MRS (firstname)!!! PEOPLE SAY YOU VERY SICK!! WE COME CLEAN ROOM??" Me: NO. Day 2 Housekeeping: "MRS (firstname)!!! PEOPLE SAY YOU VERY SICK!! WE COME CLEAN ROOM??" Me: NO. Please go away, thank you. Day 3 Housekeeping: "MRS (firstname)!!! PEOPLE SAY YOU VERY SICK!! WE COME CLEAN ROOM??" Me: NO. But do you have more toilet paper? Day 4 Housekeeping: “MRS (firstname)!!! PEOPLE SAY YOU VERY SICK!! WE COME CLEAN ROOM??" Me: ...... On Day 4, I had no choice but to drag my sorry butt out of the room and clamber on to a shuttle bus to the airport because my flight was leaving (for Vancouver, natch). The trip back to my apartment in Seattle was the most miserable multi-day journey I’ve ever taken. I don’t think I’ve ever cried so hard. Oysters are still the only food I won’t eat. If you also have a horror story from hors d’oeuvres, shoot us a note. In the meantime, bon appétit: I was in Barbados in a rural bar, hungry. I asked for food and they said they had one thing. And that’s how I had pickled chicken feet for dinner. It was sloshed out of a big bin. Update from Jacob, an “11th grader and avid fan of The Atlantic”: As a high school student, I haven’t had too many bad travel experiences, but this one’s a doozy, and when I saw your callout I immediately knew I had to submit. A few weeks ago, I traveled to South Korea for 10 days to present a collaborative science project with my Korean partners. My troubles started at around 5 o'clock the day before final presentations. We had just finished reviewing critique of our rehearsal when I suddenly began to feel sick to my stomach. Wanting to go back to my room, I went to notify Jeong-Minh, the director of the program, and was in the midst of a conversation with her in the hallway when a roiling wave of nausea hit me. I sprinted to the trash can, doubled over, and projectile vomited not one, not two, but three whole times in a spray of half-digested Korean food. Jeong-Minh just barely had the presence of mind to leap backward out of the splash zone. Hoping against hope this was just a one-and-done vomiting session, I fled back to my dormitory, only to spend the next day vomiting violently into a pink Hello-Kitty trash can with the worst case of food poisoning since the Borgias. I’m never going to be able to look at that damn cat again without a degree of horror. I would upchuck into the can, manage to fall back into a light sleep in that refractory period of relief just after a bout of vomiting, then wake up 30 minutes later to bend myself back over Hello Kitty and loose another wave. Eventually I was just dry heaving little trickles of bile. It was the sickest I’ve ever been in my life. I stopped vomiting after 24 hours, but my stomach was an achy mess for the rest of the trip, and I was holed up against my will in the dormitory for most of it, taking Buzzfeed quizzes to distract myself from the fact that it still felt like Kim Jong was conducting a nuclear weapons test in my intestines. I’m not sure why the universe saw fit to punish me that way. I have a sneaking suspicion that my weak little white stomach couldn’t handle the platters of traditional Korean food I'd been tucking away the entire trip. It must have been those “specialty” highland mushrooms. Chris Bodenner 8:45 AM / August 1, 2016 A Trip Through Eastern Europe Turns South A reader’s memory of a hellish trip to Istanbul still sounds fresh: In the early ‘90s, my young husband and I thrived on traveling as frugally as possible. We were traveling from Scandinavia and our goal was to make it to Istanbul. On a train from Poland to Romania, we were warned by a fellow tourist not to change money on the black market, because the undercover police “may arrest you.” Armed with that information, we arrived at the train station on a Sunday, eager to purchase our tickets to Istanbul and leave Romania as quickly as possible. The “Official Money Station" was manned when we approached to change our currency. “No money,” he shrugged and waved us away. With no Romanian currency, we had no money for food, lodging, or train tickets. A friendly young Romanian man approached offering to help us change money on the black market. He promised he was not a police officer. Continue Reading He told us he knew of a bus station that would take us from Bucharest to Istanbul. He led us out of the station and around a corner to a small bus ticket station, and, while he practiced English with my husband, I hand-signaled with an older woman enough for her to accept my $20 USD for our ride out. When we informed our friendly translator/guide that we no longer required his services, he kicked my husband in the shin (my husband was a towering 6'4”) and declared that he would “get his gun and come back to shoot us.” We were completely terror-stricken. The locals, who spoke no English, just looked at us and smiled while we ran to duck behind the ticket counter. The proprietor followed us back and said: “Me Turk. No problem.” Then he opened his top drawer to reveal a machete. We were relieved and willing when the un-air-conditioned, broken-down bus arrived to take us away, shuttling us to a standard-looking coach bus filled with Italian tourists. Everyone smoked cigarettes. Music blared. Not a word of English was spoken. There was no toilet on the bus. We made it as far as the border of Bulgaria. The bus stopped and turned off the engine in a long trail of cars and buses. Apparently everyone who was supposed to be working the border was preoccupied watching the World Cup Soccer Championship matches.   For nine hours, all traffic was halted while the games played. We exited the bus and wandered across streams of garbage and gypsy children playing on train tracks. Hours later on the bus, mosquitos buzzing, my husband finally fell asleep, but I was desperate to pee. The driver escorted me off the bus and watched me urinate. Then he put his arm around me and attempted to invite me to join him somewhere else. I elbowed him with all of my might and jumped back on the bus. I shook my husband out of his slumber and did not allow him to sleep after that. The border crossing finally reopened. They collected our passports and handed each passenger two cartons of cigarettes and eight bottles of alcohol to carry as contraband mules across the border. They stocked the back of the bus, and our passports were returned. Twenty-five hours later, I saw the minarets and knew we had arrived. I developed a migraine and threw up. But at least we made it to Istanbul. Bonus anecdote from another reader, in Ukraine: I’m 19 years old on train from Lviv to Kiev. It’s an overnighter and I’m booked in a 2nd class sleeper car which has four bunks on each side. I’m scared out of my mind when I realize I’m the only woman in the compartment. The men see that I’m freaking out and find a translator to explain (actual words): “We want to reassure you that your body is safe and we will not rape you as you sleep.” Thanks?   Chris Bodenner 2:45 PM / July 29, 2016 Tell Us: What's Your Worst Travel Experience? A bunch of Atlantic readers in this discussion group are exchanging their travel horror stories. (If you’d like to sharing your own, please send us a note: hello@theatlantic.com.) A short anecdote from the group: I caught bronchitis when I was in Germany for a business trip. Spent the plane ride home sitting next to a strange drunk man who kept talking at me. Intolerable Cruelty starring George Clooney and Catherine Zeta-Jones was the in-flight movie. I wanted to die. Another reader shares that sentiment: I was stuck in the snowbound Omaha airport with a three year old, a chihuahua, and a small carryon bag, for TWO DAYS. That was the ninth circle of hell. I wanted to die. This next reader nearly did, for real: Peace Corps: On a bus in Guatemala. A group of three teens in MS-13 [a notorious gang] decide to rob our bus. Being the only American on the bus and having just gone to the bank, I took all the money I had hidden in my bra and put it in my pocket ready to be robbed. People would get shot if they tried to run, so I prepared to give everything and pulled my passport out of its hiding spot in my bag so I made sure they knew they were getting it. Then some dude decided to John Wayne and open fire on these robbers, which resulted in a firefight on a very crowded bus. I had actually been the next passenger to be robbed, so the perp standing next to me was actively shooting. I dove under the seat and stayed there until literally everyone else had gotten off the bus. Bonus trip: I got a lightly armored security escort back to the embassy. This reader’s experience is much more relatable: I travel for work, so I have A LOT of these stories. I have two that beat out all of the other minor upsets though: Continue Reading 1) I started a flight with a guy interrupting me while I was reading just so he could tell me that he “might grab my knee” because he’s “afraid of flying.” I replied, “the fuck you will.” Then he proceeded to vape for the entire flight. When I pointed out that it’s a federal crime to do that, he said he had really bad cravings. AND THEN, as he was deplaning, he hit his lady-friend square on her read end ... it was the cherry on top of a disturbing trip. 2) THE WORST was when I was flying from Chicago to Manchester last October. The man sitting next to me spread all over my seat, took off his shoes, AND unbuttoned his pants. And when I asked to get out to use the restroom, he suggested that I just “climb over my lap, baby.” Another reader, Nick, also had a creepy encounter: On a six-hour train ride in China, a man stared at me the entire fucking time. Like literally he didn’t move his eyes off me. I don’t know if that was worse than the time I was really sick on a transatlantic flight, but it was definitely the weirdest. This next reader thinks back to Memorial Day weekend in the late ‘90s: I’m living on Long Island and using what precious little vacation and holiday time I have to visit my LDR girlfriend in Rochester. I have my friend drop me off at JFK in the late afternoon with maybe an hour to spare before boarding (plenty of time, as this is pre-TSA). As I’m waiting, the delays start piling up on the info screen because of some freak storm over half of the country, though the local weather is fine. My flight gets delayed, of course. Over the next few hours, the delay gets pushed further and further back. Finally, it gets cancelled. But by then it’s way too late to call any of my friends to pick me up. So I can either spend the night in pre-renovated JFK, or take a two-hour train ride home so I can sleep in my own bed for a few hours before trying again in the morning. Both options suck, but I figure some sleep is better than none and head out to the train. Now we come to the actual bad part. I have to take a rail shuttle from the airport to the station, then take two different subway rides into Penn Station, where I can catch a LIRR train to take me home. The first ride is uneventful. On the second one, however, I’m joined by a couple of young women a few seats in front of me, a younger man who goes to the back, and another younger man who does not take a seat but quickly sets to trying to impress the two women. Also worth noting is that I’m the only person on board who isn’t black. The young hotshot starts sort-of-rapping about how tough and badass he is. The women seem unimpressed as far as I can tell, but really this whole time I’ve just been trying very hard to focus on the Robert Anton Wilson book I’m reading. Hotshot changes tactics and tries to impress them by provoking me into a fight. He gets in my face and taunts me for being in the wrong place or something, but I just shake my head and keep my eyes on my book. The train slows and starts to pull up to the next platform. He disappears behind me, and a few seconds later something hard hits me in the back of my head. At this point I’m exhausted, frustrated, and already very angry about the flight situation. I was running on fumes and adrenaline. So when I got hit, something in me just snapped. I remember folding the book and putting it down. Thoughts about my physical abilities versus his and the possibility that he may have a weapon immediately popped up. The angry animal part of my brain was in charge, though, so I disregarded them just as quickly. I stood up and turned around to face whatever this guy thought he was going to do to me. The doors are open and he is gone. At my feet is the small, depleted corn cob from a discarded KFC meal box. I wipe some bits of kernel from the back of my head and neck. The women and guy from the back all rush over to me to make sure I’m okay. After we’re all sure I’m fine, the guy says, “It’s too bad he ran off. I was going to hold him so you could kick his ass.” More Notes From The Atlantic Track of the Day: ‘Last Night I Dreamt That Somebody Love...

Spencer saluted more than 200 attendees on Saturday, gathered at the Ronald Reagan Building in Washington, D.C., for the annual conference of the National Policy Institute, which describes itself as “an independent organization dedicated to the heritage, identity, and future of  people of European descent in the United States, and around the world.” Spencer has popularized the term “alt-right” to describe the movement he leads. Spencer has said his dream is “a new society, an ethno-state that would be a gathering point for all Europeans,” and has called for “peaceful ethnic cleansing.” For most of the day, a parade of speakers discussed their ideology in relatively anodyne terms, putting a presentable face on their agenda. But after dinner, when most journalists had already departed, Spencer rose and delivered a speech to his followers dripping with anti-Semitism, and leaving no doubt as to what he actually seeks. He referred to the mainstream media as “Lügenpresse,” a term he said he was borrowing from “the original German”; the Nazis used the word to attack their critics in the press.

Americans talk about democracy like it’s sacred. In public discourse, the more democratic American government is, the better. The people are supposed to rule. But that’s not the premise that underlies America’s political system. Most of the men who founded the United States feared unfettered majority rule. James Madison wrote in Federalist 10 that systems of government based upon “pure democracy … have ever been found incompatible with personal security or the rights of property.” John Adams wrote in 1814 that, “Democracy never lasts long. It soon wastes, exhausts and murders itself.” The framers constructed a system that had democratic features. The people had a voice. They could, for instance, directly elect members of the House of Representatives. But the founders also self-consciously limited the people’s voice.

But we also use it when we’re all alone; it shapes even our silent relationships with ourselves. In his book, The Voices Within, Charles Fernyhough gives a historical overview of “inner speech”—the more scientific term for “talking to yourself in your head.” Fernyhough, a professor at Durham University in the U.K., says that inner speech develops alongside social speech. This idea was pioneered by Lev Vygotsky, a Russian psychologist who studied children in the 1920s and noted that when they learned to talk to other humans, they also learned how to talk to themselves, first out loud, and eventually, in their heads. Continue Reading Yamada Taro / Getty What’s So Great About American World Leadership? Hugh White The U.S. voters who rejected decades of bipartisan foreign-policy consensus might be on to something. How has America come to elect a president who so starkly repudiated decades’ worth of the largely bipartisan vision of U.S. global leadership? And if that vision won’t be the basis of American foreign policy in the 21st century, what will replace it? The big message of 2016 is that large numbers of American voters, Democrat and Republican, do not buy what their political leaders have been selling for so long, and that includes foreign policy. The evidence of this from Trump’s victory is reinforced by Senator Bernie Sanders’ remarkable showing in the Democratic primaries, and by years’ worth of public-opinion surveys showing the widespread view that the United States “does too much in helping solve world problems.” It is also reinforced by the high poll numbers of an outgoing president who has mounted his own quiet campaign against key elements of Washington’s foreign-policy orthodoxy. Continue Reading Carlo Allegri / Reuters Donald Trump's Conflicts of Interest: A Crib Sheet Jeremy Venook A semi-comprehensive list of the business concerns that may influence the president-elect as he prepares for the nation’s highest office Though several previous presidents have entered office with private fortunes to their names, none has done so with a business empire nearly as large or complicated as that of President-elect Donald J. Trump. Estimates of Trump’s wealth vary substantially: While he self-reports a net worth of $10 billion, independent agencies have arrived at valuation generally between $3 billion and $5 billion. The unprecedented nature of Trump’s business interests, coupled with the many precedents that Trump broke throughout his campaign—not releasing his tax returns, for example, which severely limits attempts to understand his financial situation—has provoked speculation that his presidency may bring about equally unprecedented opportunities for conflicts of interest. Trump’s response—provided on Twitter—only reinforces concerns that he will make little effort to avoid entangling his business and personal interests, and will instead attack those who point that out. Continue Reading Etienne Fabre / SSAC A Shocking Find In a Neanderthal Cave In France Ed Yong A rock structure, built deep underground, is one of the earliest hominin constructions ever found. In February 1990, thanks to a 15-year-old boy named Bruno Kowalsczewski, footsteps echoed through the chambers of Bruniquel Cave for the first time in tens of thousands of years. The cave sits in France’s scenic Aveyron Valley, but its entrance had long been sealed by an ancient rockslide. Kowalsczewski’s father had detected faint wisps of air emerging from the scree, and the boy spent three years clearing away the rubble. He eventually dug out a tight, thirty-meter-long passage that the thinnest members of the local caving club could squeeze through. They found themselves in a large, roomy corridor. There were animal bones and signs of bear activity, but nothing recent. The floor was pockmarked with pools of water. The walls were punctuated by stalactites (the ones that hang down) and stalagmites (the ones that stick up). Continue Reading sketchblog/flickr Masters of Love Emily Esfahani Smith Science says lasting relationships come down to—you guessed it—kindness and generosity. Every day in June, the most popular wedding month of the year, about 13,000 American couples will say “I do,” committing to a lifelong relationship that will be full of friendship, joy, and love that will carry them forward to their final days on this earth. Except, of course, it doesn’t work out that way for most people. The majority of marriages fail, either ending in divorce and separation or devolving into bitterness and dysfunction. Of all the people who get married, only three in ten remain in healthy, happy marriages, as psychologist Ty Tashiro points out in his book The Science of Happily Ever After, which was published earlier this year. Social scientists first started studying marriages by observing them in action in the 1970s in response to a crisis: Married couples were divorcing at unprecedented rates. Worried about the impact these divorces would have on the children of the broken marriages, psychologists decided to cast their scientific net on couples, bringing them into the lab to observe them and determine what the ingredients of a healthy, lasting relationship were. Was each unhappy family unhappy in its own way, as Tolstoy claimed, or did the miserable marriages all share something toxic in common? Continue Reading Chris Keane / Reuters What's Really Going On in North Carolina's Gubernatorial Race? David A. Graham Recounts, lawsuits, challenges—and the prospect of a legislative coup? Here’s why the race between Governor Pat McCrory and Democrat Roy Cooper isn’t over yet. DURHAM, N.C.—It’s been two weeks since Election Day, which means that in 49 states, residents know who their governor will be next year. North Carolinians, however, are still waiting to see. At the end of balloting on November 8, Democrat Roy Cooper, the current state attorney general, had a lead of a few thousand votes over Governor Pat McCrory, a Republican. Cooper promptly declared victory, but McCrory has not conceded the race, and the state has not been able to declare a winner. On Monday, Cooper announced a transition team, while McCrory accused him of “circumventing the electoral process.” Cooper’s lead fluctuated throughout the day on Tuesday as more counties returned their final canvass, but as of writing it was a little more than 6,000 votes out of roughly 4,700,000. (The most up-to-date results are here.) Continue Reading Ricardo Moraes / Reuters The Average 29-Year-Old Derek Thompson Forget media archetypes of older Millennials as college-educated singles living in cities. The typical 29-year-old is living with a partner in the suburbs—without a bachelor’s degree. What is the typical life experience for an American on the verge of turning 30? This is a hard question to answer, no matter who is asking. But it’s become especially difficult for an industry responsible with providing the answers: the national press. An irony of digital media is that the Internet distributes journalism, but it concentrates journalists. Jobs at media sites like The Atlantic, BuzzFeed, or Gawker are five-times more likely to be located in New York or Washington, D.C., than television-news jobs. The clustering force is only getting more centripetal: The share of reporting jobs in Los Angeles, NYC, and DC increased by 60 percent between 2004 and 2014. It’s easy to imagine many downsides of this agglomeration, like the dissolution of local reporting, but a subtler risk is that well-educated journalists in these dense cities wind up with a skewed impression of the world, a “majority illusion” based on the extremely unrepresentative cross-section of the country that’s immediately around them. To be fair, being a reporter in Des Moines or rural Nebraska, while it provides a better view of Des Moines and rural Nebraska, doesn’t offer a universal window into the average experiences of all Americans, either. For that, one needs something else, like a national survey.

The unprecedented nature of Trump’s business interests, coupled with the many precedents that Trump broke throughout his campaign—not releasing his tax returns, for example, which severely limits attempts to understand his financial situation—has provoked speculation that his presidency may bring about equally unprecedented opportunities for conflicts of interest. Trump’s response—provided on Twitter—only reinforces concerns that he will make little effort to avoid entangling his business and personal interests, and will instead attack those who point that out. Continue Reading sketchblog/flickr Masters of Love Emily Esfahani Smith Science says lasting relationships come down to—you guessed it—kindness and generosity. Every day in June, the most popular wedding month of the year, about 13,000 American couples will say “I do,” committing to a lifelong relationship that will be full of friendship, joy, and love that will carry them forward to their final days on this earth. Except, of course, it doesn’t work out that way for most people. The majority of marriages fail, either ending in divorce and separation or devolving into bitterness and dysfunction. Of all the people who get married, only three in ten remain in healthy, happy marriages, as psychologist Ty Tashiro points out in his book The Science of Happily Ever After, which was published earlier this year. Social scientists first started studying marriages by observing them in action in the 1970s in response to a crisis: Married couples were divorcing at unprecedented rates. Worried about the impact these divorces would have on the children of the broken marriages, psychologists decided to cast their scientific net on couples, bringing them into the lab to observe them and determine what the ingredients of a healthy, lasting relationship were. Was each unhappy family unhappy in its own way, as Tolstoy claimed, or did the miserable marriages all share something toxic in common? Continue Reading Etienne Fabre / SSAC A Shocking Find In a Neanderthal Cave In France Ed Yong A rock structure, built deep underground, is one of the earliest hominin constructions ever found. In February 1990, thanks to a 15-year-old boy named Bruno Kowalsczewski, footsteps echoed through the chambers of Bruniquel Cave for the first time in tens of thousands of years. The cave sits in France’s scenic Aveyron Valley, but its entrance had long been sealed by an ancient rockslide. Kowalsczewski’s father had detected faint wisps of air emerging from the scree, and the boy spent three years clearing away the rubble. He eventually dug out a tight, thirty-meter-long passage that the thinnest members of the local caving club could squeeze through. They found themselves in a large, roomy corridor. There were animal bones and signs of bear activity, but nothing recent. The floor was pockmarked with pools of water. The walls were punctuated by stalactites (the ones that hang down) and stalagmites (the ones that stick up).

Here’s why the race between Governor Pat McCrory and Democrat Roy Cooper isn’t over yet. DURHAM, N.C.—It’s been two weeks since Election Day, which means that in 49 states, residents know who their governor will be next year. North Carolinians, however, are still waiting to see. At the end of balloting on November 8, Democrat Roy Cooper, the current state attorney general, had a lead of a few thousand votes over Governor Pat McCrory, a Republican. Cooper promptly declared victory, but McCrory has not conceded the race, and the state has not been able to declare a winner. On Monday, Cooper announced a transition team, while McCrory accused him of “circumventing the electoral process.” Cooper’s lead fluctuated throughout the day on Tuesday as more counties returned their final canvass, but as of writing it was a little more than 6,000 votes out of roughly 4,700,000. (The most up-to-date results are here.) Continue Reading Ricardo Moraes / Reuters The Average 29-Year-Old Derek Thompson Forget media archetypes of older Millennials as college-educated singles living in cities. The typical 29-year-old is living with a partner in the suburbs—without a bachelor’s degree. What is the typical life experience for an American on the verge of turning 30? This is a hard question to answer, no matter who is asking. But it’s become especially difficult for an industry responsible with providing the answers: the national press. An irony of digital media is that the Internet distributes journalism, but it concentrates journalists. Jobs at media sites like The Atlantic, BuzzFeed, or Gawker are five-times more likely to be located in New York or Washington, D.C., than television-news jobs. The clustering force is only getting more centripetal: The share of reporting jobs in Los Angeles, NYC, and DC increased by 60 percent between 2004 and 2014. It’s easy to imagine many downsides of this agglomeration, like the dissolution of local reporting, but a subtler risk is that well-educated journalists in these dense cities wind up with a skewed impression of the world, a “majority illusion” based on the extremely unrepresentative cross-section of the country that’s immediately around them. To be fair, being a reporter in Des Moines or rural Nebraska, while it provides a better view of Des Moines and rural Nebraska, doesn’t offer a universal window into the average experiences of all Americans, either. For that, one needs something else, like a national survey. Continue Reading More Popular Stories Subscribe Get 10 issues a year and save 65% off the cover price.

Like Dallas News' Facebook Page Get Unlimited Digital Access Your first month is less than a dollar. $0.99 for first 4 weeks Subscribe Now A linchpin to government accountability lies in the old admonition to "follow the money." But that's an impossible task when the law says the government -- and companies doing business with government -- can legally hide the trail. The fallout from a June 2015 ruling by the Texas Supreme Court is becoming painfully clear as key details of government contracts, once routine items of public disclosure, are instead being withheld as guarded state secrets. A random sampling: Costs of a Kaufman County school district's food service contract. The number of Uber drivers ferrying passengers around Houston. And, amusingly, in an anxiety-inducing sort of way, the amount the city of McAllen paid singer Enrique Iglesias for an hour-long outdoor concert to lead off its annual holiday parade last December. All result from from a 7-1 opinion by the state's highest court, made over the objections of Attorney General Ken Paxton's office. The decision expanded the acceptable reasons for withholding information about contracts between government and private businesses. The decision in Boeing vs. Paxton stems from the giant aircraft manufacturer's claim that disclosing financial information about its contract with the inland Port of San Antonio could give an edge to its business competitors. That opinion, a reversal of two lower court rulings, is a dramatic reinterpretation of financial disclosure exemptions originally meant to protect the contract bidding process. "It's one of the worst rulings ever to come out of the Texas Supreme Court," said open government attorney Joe Larsen, a board member for the Freedom of Information Foundation of Texas, in an interview with the Texas Tribune. "If there's a place where corruption can fester, it's here." To be clear: This is not a matter of protecting business trade secrets from unfair exposure. Provisions for protecting proprietary information existed in the Texas Public Information Act prior to the Boeing decision. "Open government people realize there are some things business should protect," former Deputy Texas Attorney General Bill Cobb told the Houston Chronicle in May. "But there is clear direction and standard on what you have to do to prove that." The new decision, he said, "blew a hole" in state public disclosure laws. This should be a matter of bipartisan concern, and there are encouraging signs of bipartisan action in the next state legislative session. State Rep. Terry Canales, D-Edinburg, who took notice of the issue with the furor over McAllen's refusal to disclose Iglesias' performance fee, is reportedly contemplating whether to introduce corrective legislation specifically targeting entertainment contracts or taking a broader approach to the exemptions. And a spokesman for Rep. Giovanni Capriglione, R-Southlake, is also said to be working with open records advocates on a remedy to restore at least some of the transparency the ruling has cost. More legislators on both sides of the aisle need to pay attention. Public accountability matters, and transparency is where accountability starts. In their own words "It's one of the worst rulings ever to come out of the Texas Supreme Court. If there's any place where corruption can fester, it's here." -- Joe Larsen, open government advocate and board member, Freedom of Information Foundation of Texas  "The court opened the floodgates on this one. It blew a hole in the Texas Public Information Act." -- Bill Cobb, former Texas deputy attorney general under then-Attorney General Greg Abbott View Comments Tags Editorials Opinion Texas Legislature Share Facebook Twitter Email Print This Story Get the Most Important D-FW News in Your Inbox Sign up for our daily email newsletters Get Headlines, Business, SportsDay, and GuideLive.

More Comments LinkedIn Tumblr Pinterest Digg FarkIt StumbleUpon OTTAWA — The F-35 stealth fighter, described by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau as “far from working,” has been declared by the U.S. Air Force as ready for combat. In a statement Tuesday, U.S. Air Force Gen. Hawk Carlisle, commander of Air Combat Command, said the air force version of the aircraft has met all key criteria for reaching initial operational capability. “I am proud to announce this powerful new weapons system has achieved initial combat capability,” Carlisle said. “The F-35A will be the most dominant aircraft in our inventory, because it can go where our legacy aircraft cannot and provide the capabilities our commanders need on the modern battlefield.” The declaration is sure to cause more political headaches for the Liberal government. In early June, as the debate continued over which fighter jet should be selected to replace Canada’s CF-18s, Trudeau dismissed the F-35, claiming the jet “does not work and is far from working.” The F-35A is the aircraft once considered by Canada and could in future be a potential contender for any CF-18 replacement. During last year’s election campaign, Trudeau promised Canada would not purchase the F-35, an aircraft he said was too expensive and unnecessary for the country’s needs. But last week five defence firms, including Lockheed Martin, the manufacturer of the F-35, responded to the Liberal government’s call for information about fighter jets that could replace the CF-18s. Boeing Co. submitted information on its Super Hornet, Lockheed Martin on the F-35, Dassault Aviation on the Rafale, Eurofighter GmbH on the Typhoon and Saab Group on the Gripen. How the Liberals will now proceed on fighter-jet replacement is unknown. Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan has said the bidding process would be open and has argued that the CF-18s have to be replaced as soon as possible. But asked recently when the Liberal government will know how it is going to proceed, Sajjan said he couldn’t provide specific details. “It all depends on a lot of the information that we do collect, but it is going to be months, not years definitely because of the urgency for this,” he said.  “I can’t give you a precise date but, like I said, it will be in the months coming.” The F-35 became a major political headache several years ago for the Conservative government. Although a Liberal government originally signed on to a research and development program for the plane, the Conservatives significantly expanded commitment and later agreed to the purchase 65 jets. But the program was dogged by controversy and the aircraft faced numerous technical problems. Related Liberals pay $33 million to stay in F -35 development program, despite promise not to buy the fighter jet Eight CF-18s deployed for month to U.S.-led exercise despite Liberals’ warning of jet shortage U.S. Navy pilots report oxygen shortage while flying Super Hornet jets being considered by Liberals The Department of National Defence originally claimed the project would cost about $14.7 billion, but then-parliamentary budget officer Kevin Page put the price tag at about $29 billion. Auditor general Michael Ferguson also issued a report that concluded DND officials withheld key information from Parliament about the fighter-jet purchase, underestimated costs and didn’t follow proper procurement rules. An independent audit on Canada’s proposed F-35 project found the purchase of the aircraft would cost $44 billion over the 42-year life of the plane. That included everything from maintenance to fuel. In addition, some U.S. lawmakers have raised concerns the aircraft is too expensive and won’t be able to fulfill its military’s requirements. But aerospace industry officials say the declaration that F-35A is ready for combat is good news for the troubled aircraft program. But others point out that more development of the plane is needed. A fighter squadron in Utah is the U.S. Air Force’s first operational F-35A unit. The U.S. Marines had earlier declared another version of the F-35 ready for combat. • Email: dpugliese@postmedia.com | Twitter: davidpugliese Find National Post on Facebook Twitter Google+ Reddit Email Typo?

Trump included a call for a 15% corporate rate in a Detroit speech where he outlined other tax and economic reforms. Business groups have long said their members are hurt because US companies pay the most federal income tax - a 35% rate, though the effective rate is often lower - among the 35 countries in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development. “The fact that he is pushing for a 15% corporate tax rate is definitely a positive,” said Dorothy Coleman, vice president of tax and domestic economic policy for the National Association of Manufacturers. “Tax reform is really one of the important goals that we have.” The Rate Coalition, which lists Boeing, Ford and Wal-Mart among corporate supporters, said it won’t endorse all aspects of Trump’s plan but that the tax proposal is a “huge step in the right direction and we urge other candidates in the race to follow his lead.” Trump also called for a 10% levy on overseas cash that companies have been unwilling to bring home because of high US taxes. The US rate also impedes foreign investment in the country, Coleman said, and some American companies have used acquisitions to set up headquarters in foreign countries with lower taxes. For small businesses, the proposal was a “home run,” said Juanita Duggan, chief executive officer of the National Federation of Independent Business. It would provide the same 15% rate for companies no matter their size, freeing up funds to invest back into family businesses, she said. “He got that exactly right,” Duggan said. “Small business cannot pay a higher rate than Exxon Mobil.” Tax rates The US last adjusted its corporate tax in 1993 when it was pushed up by a percentage point to 35%, said Alan Cole, an economist with the Tax Foundation’s Centre for Federal Tax Policy. Under a 1986 tax bill, the rate was phased down to 34% from 46%, he said. Countries around the world have steadily been ratcheting down their tax rate to become more competitive, Cole said. The average corporate tax rate when including state levies and weighted by the size of economy has declined to about 29% from 36% in 2003. The US corporate tax when including state levies is about 39%, according to the OECD. “Most countries have been moving down while the US has stood still,” he said. The manufacturers association still wants to see more particulars on Trump’s plan, as well as more incentive for capital spending and research and development, Coleman said: “The devil is in the details on this.” Read Fin24's top stories trending on Twitter: Fin24’s top stories Follow Fin24 on Twitter, Facebook, Google+ and Pinterest. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.

Qantas is set to reveal the first route with its first Boeing 787 this year and is said to be considering a direct link from the UK to Australia. The Australian airline is reportedly planning a route from London to Perth which would make it a contender for the world's longest flight. The air distance between London and Perth is about 14,470km. Meanwhile, the carrier is deferring deliveries of its eight remaining A380s that were ordered from Airbus, Bloomberg reported.

Trump included a call for a 15 percent corporate rate in a Detroit speech where he outlined other tax and economic reforms. Business groups have long said their members are hurt because U.S. companies pay the most federal income tax—a 35 percent rate, though the effective rate is often lower—among the 35 countries in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. “The fact that he is pushing for a 15 percent corporate tax rate is definitely a positive,” said Dorothy Coleman, vice president of tax and domestic economic policy for the National Association of Manufacturers. “Tax reform is really one of the important goals that we have.” The Rate Coalition, which lists Boeing Co., Ford Motor Co. and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. among corporate supporters, said it won’t endorse all aspects of Trump’s plan but that the tax proposal is a “huge step in the right direction and we urge other candidates in the race to follow his lead.” Trump also called for a 10 percent levy on overseas cash that companies have been unwilling to bring home because of high U.S. taxes. The U.S. rate also impedes foreign investment in the country, Coleman said, and some American companies have used acquisitions to set up headquarters in foreign countries with lower taxes. For small businesses, the proposal was a “home run,” said Juanita Duggan, CEO of the National Federation of Independent Business. It would provide the same 15 percent rate for companies no matter their size, freeing up funds to invest back into family businesses, she said. “He got that exactly right,” Duggan said. “Small business cannot pay a higher rate than Exxon Mobil.” The U.S. last adjusted its corporate tax in 1993 when it was pushed up by a percentage point to 35 percent, said Alan Cole, an economist with the Tax Foundation’s Center for Federal Tax Policy. Under a 1986 tax bill, the rate was phased down to 34 percent from 46 percent, he said. Countries around the world have steadily been ratcheting down their tax rate to become more competitive, Cole said. The average corporate tax rate when including state levies and weighted by the size of economy has declined to about 29 percent from 36 percent in 2003. The U.S. corporate tax when including state levies is about 39 percent, according to the OECD. “Most countries have been moving down while the U.S. has stood still,” he said. The manufacturers association still wants to see more particulars on Trump’s plan, as well as more incentive for capital spending and research and development, Coleman said: “The devil is in the details on this.” Email Tweet ADVERTISEMENT Recent Articles by Bloomberg News Shippers FedEx, UPS expect another record-setting holiday season Department stores change tactics as more sales go online Lilly’s Alzheimer’s disease drug fails in final-stage trial Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

Think tanks are non-profit policy research establishments with tax-exempt status, as they are assumed to be doing work to advance the public good, not cater to private interests. Traditional lobbying of the federal government is likewise regulated to promote transparency. When the rules become too onerous, or the public image of a corporation is stained by its overt solicitations for policy change, think tanks become a useful corporate device, the New York Times has found, in a Sunday report jointly researched with the New England Center for Investigative Reporting (NECIR). In one instance, drone manufacturer and military contractor General Atomics sought the services of the think tank Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS). With the Afghanistan and Iraq wars in a slump in 2013, fewer drones were being sold to the US military. The California-based maker of Predator drones needed to find customers abroad, but weapons trade restrictions at the time prohibited their export. Following a donation of tens of thousands of dollars to CSIS – a small sum compared to other donors such as Lockheed Martin and Boeing, the Times reported – the think tank not only completed a study on drone policy and export in 2014, but actually arranged secret meetings in its office headquarters with officials from the Air Force, Marine Corps, Navy and the State Department as well as the secretary of defense. General Atomics now had prime access to policymakers in the think tank space to advance its business goals. The State Department then released new trade rules in February 2015, encouraging fewer limits on the export of drones, leading to a deal between General Atomics and the United Arab Emirates. The sale of unarmed drones to a non-NATO country was the first of its kind, according to the Times. The Brookings Institution, a left-leaning powerhouse in Washington, had “thousands of pages of internal memos and confidential correspondence,” with for-profit businesses, including JPMorgan Chase, the biggest of the big US banks, the Times-NECIR report said. Offering “donation benefits” in its memos, Brookings appeared to “blur the lines” between offering neutral research and corporate public relations, according to the report. Called a “university without students,” Brookings was named “Top think tank in the world” in a 2015 report by the University of Pennsylvania. Founded in 1916, the think tank operates on an average annual income of $107.5 million, according to TheBestSchools.org, which lists it as number 7 of the 50 most influential think tanks in the US. The Times-NECIR report said that dollar figure represents a doubling in the tank’s budget in the last decade. According to the report, JPMorgan made a tax-deductible donation of $15.5 million 2011 to Brookings' Metropolitan Policy Program, the largest sum of money ever received by the institution from a private company. However, what came out of that gift was a brand new project dubbed the Global Cities Initiative. It even had a logo including the line “joint project of Brookings and JPMorgan Chase,” a corporate rebranding tactic some argue. The project encouraged both local economic growth and international trade, of which JPMorgan would have a major stake in through its business loan programs. “Bottom line: Growing metro economies is good for the nation and for JPMC; also, many U.S. cities are JPMC clients — motivation to support them and their clients,” a July 2011 internal Brookings document read, according to the Times-NECIR report. The appearance of quid-pro-quo was not lost on those at Brookings. “No one wants to create overt marketing opportunities for JPMC, but we need to carve out roles and thought leadership opportunity for market presidents,” read a 2013 Brookings memo referring to a dinner with JPMorgan executives, the Times reported. “We need to do a better job tying it back to JPMC.” Based on the documents obtained via an open records request, the report appears to reflect an open secret on Capitol Hill. In September 2015, Brookings lost Robert Litan as a senior fellow economist, after he was accused of withholding information showing a conflict of interest in his own research against financial reform related to retirement advising, the International Business Times reported. The pressure came came from Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Massachusetts), who called Litan “an industry player seeking a specific conclusion.” Warren spoke to the New York Times for its recent report, regarding the consequences of special interested-peddled research when it reaches congressional chambers. “[Corporations] take a lot of money, because they got plenty of money to spend. They put it into a think tank, with a few strings attached, and the think tank comes up with the research that just so happens to advance the interests of the corporation,” Warren said, adding, “That then means, right here in the Senate, we can make bad decisions … not decisions that favor the American people.” Brookings executive vice president Martin S. Indyk denies the implied allegations. “We do not compromise our integrity,” Indyk told the New York Times. “We maintain our core values of quality, independence, as well as impact,” adding that Brookings recently disallowed any corporation or corporate-supported entity from contributing anonymously.

U.S.-supported Saudi Arabian and other bombing of Yemeni sites, including the capital, Sana, resumed Tuesday, with lethal results. The multiparty Yemen civil war, with substantial international involvement, has continued for 15 months now, with thousands of casualties from the fighting and particularly the bombing, but also taking a high toll among the civilians of this poorest of Middle Eastern states. It pits Houthi Shiite Muslim rebels, backed to a degree by predominantly Shiite Iran, supported by Sunni Muslim supporters of the former president, Ali Abdullah Saleh, against the Sunni Muslim government of Yemen President Abdu Rabbu Mansour Hadi and the Sunni states of the Persian Gulf. These are led by Saudi Arabia and include Bahrain, Egypt, Sudan and the United Arab Emirates. What the list leaves out is that the United States provides technical and intelligence support to the Sunni side, based in part on the fact that the air forces of Saudi Arabia and the other Gulf states were largely sold to them by American companies, including McDonnell Douglas, Boeing, Raytheon and Lockheed Martin. It is unlikely that Saudi Arabia could put these warplanes in the air to bomb Yemen without substantial U.S. assistance. Washington declines to say whether there are ever U.S. co-pilots in the aircraft. There were peace talks involving the parties to the conflict under the auspices of the United Nations underway in Kuwait for the past nine weeks, but these have now collapsed, without success, at least for the moment. The United States has not promoted the talks, reflecting Saudi lack of enthusiasm for an end to the conflict without victory for its side. This approach to a brutal intra-Islamic war is an unacceptable policy position for the United States to take. President Barack Obama should weigh in with a strong initiative to resume the Yemen peace talks on an urgent basis and to pursue them to a successful close, for humanitarian as well as political reasons. If the Saudis are perceived to be dragging their feet, Washington should threaten to cut off U.S. support of their bombing in Yemen.  Commercial commitments do not provide a sufficient argument for the perpetuation of the war and the continued killing of Yemenis through U.S.-supported bombing.

Under the Next Space Technologies for Exploration Partnerships-2 (NextSTEP-2) program, NASA officials selected six U.S. companies to develop deep space habitat ground prototypes and concepts. NASA estimates the combined total of all contracts covering work in 2016 and 2017 will be approximately $65 million, with additional efforts and funding continuing into 2018. The NextSTEP-2 program, consisting of NASA and industry partners, aims to expand commercial development of space in low-Earth orbit (LEO), and at the same time improve deep space exploration capabilities. The goals of the ground prototypes are to support integrated systems testing, human factors and operations testing, and to help define overall system functionality. This round of NextSTEP selections are part of a phased approach that will leverage commercial investment in low-Earth orbit and lead to an operational deep space habitation capability for missions. The six companies selected are: Bigelow Aerospace in Las Vegas; Boeing in Pasadena, Texas; Lockheed Martin in Denver; Orbital ATK in Dulles, Virginia; Sierra Nevada Corporation’s Space Systems in Louisville, Colorado; and NanoRacks in Webster, Texas. NextSTEP is managed by the Advanced Exploration Systems Division (AES) in NASA’s Human Exploration and Operations Mission Directorate. Officials say, these missions will demonstrate human, robotic, and spacecraft operations in a true deep space environment that’s still relatively close to Earth and validate technologies for the longer journey to Mars. “NASA is on an ambitious expansion of human spaceflight, including the Journey to Mars, and we’re utilizing the innovation, skill and knowledge of both the government and private sectors,” says Jason Crusan, director of NASA’s Advanced Exploration Systems. “The next human exploration capabilities needed beyond the Space Launch System (SLS) rocket and Orion capsule are deep space, long duration habitation and in-space propulsion. We are now adding focus and specifics on the deep space habitats where humans will live and work independently for months or years at a time, without cargo supply deliveries from Earth.” The first round of selected companies consists of Bigelow Aerospace LLC, Boeing, Lockheed Martin, and Orbital ATK. NASA made the first NextSTEP selections in 2015, which include deep space habitation concept studies that also advance low-Earth orbit commercial capabilities.

Patel Space Travel August 10, 2016 On Tuesday, NASA announced it had finally selected six companies to build deep space habitat prototypes for ground testing as part of the overall effort to expand human space and habitation throughout cis-lunar space and advancing technologies that will be critical for sending astronauts to Mars by 2040. The announcement comes just a few months after NASA put out a call for design proposals to the private spaceflight industry. The agency was likely spurred by instructions from Congress to provide a report within the first half of the year to explain how federal funds would be used to build and test a deep space habitation model. NASA has clearly missed that deadline, but it looks like it’s still shooting to have an operational prototype ready for ground testing by 2018. The six selections are part of NASA’s Next Space Technologies for Exploration Partnerships-2 program, or NextSTEP-2, which is meant to forge public-private partnerships between NASA and commercial companies to advance future space exploration. NASA’s “habitation strategy” is focused on two goals: allowing humans to survive up to 1,000 days in space inside a single module in order to make deep space travel and duration possible, and turning over low Earth orbit operations and development to the commercial industry. In commissioning these prototypes through NextSTEP-2, NASA wants to kill two birds with one stone. Already, the agency has seen a successful delivery and installation of BEAM — Bigelow Aerospace’s expandable module — up on the International Space Station. The technology behind expandable structures like BEAM could be a cost-effective and easy way to launch space habitats and get them up and running in no time. Bigelow is building a follow-up prototype as part of its selection for NextSTEP-2. As the only company on the list which has launched and is currently testing technology related to deep space habitation, it is already ahead of the game. In fact, Bigelow hopes to build and launch a 12,000 cubic foot habitat into space by 2020. The company has some stiff competition in its way. Here are the six selected companies for NextSTEP-2, and the designs they’re working on right now. Concept image of Boeing's prototype habitation module. Boeing This full-scale habitat design works off of the construction and on-orbit assembly of the ISS, for which Boeing has been heavily involved with during the entire 16-year operational station lifetime. You can perhaps think of it as the spiritual successor of the ISS. Concept image of Lockheed Martin's refurbished multi-purpose logistics module prototype Lockheed Martin Lockheed Martin’s prototype is actually a refurbished multi-purpose module that is similar to the cargo hulls the space shuttles used to lug supplies to and from the ISS. The company is turning this design into a testbed for habitation technologies. If it ain’t broke, recycle it. Concept image of Bigelow Aerospace's XBASE docked to the International Space Station. Bigelow Aerospace The company’s expandable XBASE (Expandable Bigelow Advanced Station Enhancement) design is the successor to BEAM. It’s the same size as the B-330 (330 cubic meters) expandable spacecraft design — but whereas that spacecraft is intended for low-Earth orbit commercialization, XBASE is focused on facilitating deep space habitation. Concept image of Orbital ATK's cislunar habitat based, based on the design of the Cygnus spacecraft. Orbital ATK Orbital actually showed this design off a couple of months ago, saying they imagined it as a lunar orbit outpost tat could actually dock with NASA’s deep-space Orion crew capsule. This cislunar habitat concept is based off the Cygnus spacecraft currently used for some ISS resupply missions. Concept image of Sierra Nevada Corporation's habitation prototype, based on its Dream Chaser cargo module. Sierra Nevada Corporation SNC essentially wants to build a version of its Dream Chaser spacecraft that can fly into deep space. Concept image representing the feasibility study that NanoRacks will conduct related to converting a launch vehicle's upper stage into a habitable volume. NanoRacks A collaboration with Space Systems Loral and United Launch Alliance, this design will look to convert the upper stage of a typical launch system into a pressurized space habitat. This would be an incredible way to make the launch of deep space modules cheaper.

Nasa has selected six companies to develop prototypes and concepts of deep space habitats for future manned missions to Mars. Habitation systems provide a safe place for humans to live as we move beyond Earth on our journey to Mars, Nasa said. “Nasa is on an ambitious expansion of human spaceflight, including the journey to Mars, and we’re utilising the innovation, skill and knowledge of the both the government and private sectors,” said Jason Crusan, director of Nasa’s Advanced Exploration Systems, adding, “We are now adding focus and specifics on the deep space habitats where humans will live and work independently for months or years at a time, without cargo supply deliveries from Earth.” The selected companies are Bigelow Aerospace, Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Orbital ATK, Sierra Nevada Corporation's Space Systems and NanoRacks.

Nasa has estimated that the combined total of all the awards, covering work in 2016 and 2017, will be about $65 million. The ground prototypes will be used for three main purposes: supporting integrated systems testing, human factors and operations testing, and to help define overall system functionality.

Now comes the hard part: Finding qualified flight controllers to operate it. Designed by HOK, the same firm that drafted Apple Inc’s research headquarters in California, the tower will be operational in about six months. Yet, it may struggle to handle more flights without enough controllers, according to aviation officials. The nation’s busiest airport needs 600 of the technicians ideally for stable operations, but employs only 360, the officials say. The shortfall has meant existing ATCs (air traffic controllers) are overworked. “It is a huge safety hazard,” said Mr Mohan Ranganathan, a former commercial pilot and an independent aviation safety consultant based in the southern Indian city of Chennai. “The air traffic controllers are being flogged in violation of fatigue rules.” The dearth of talent is threatening to reach crisis proportions as a slew of budget carriers unveil plans to add hundreds of aircraft to cater to the travel boom fuelled by rising incomes and lower fares. Adding to the challenge is Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ambitious programmes to connect smaller towns and villages by air. The situation came to a head when the United States Federal Aviation Administration downgraded India’s aviation safety rating in 2014, concluding the nation could not find enough officials to ensure the safe operation of flights. The US regulator said India’s oversight processes did not meet global standards, putting the country on par with Zimbabwe. The ranking was restored a year later after some corrective action to address shortcomings. Even so, the air-traffic controller shortage will only intensify in the coming years as local carriers buy more planes. Boeing estimates India will need 1,850 aircraft valued at US$265 billion over the next two decades. At least 709 planes are already on order. Go Airlines India said it will buy 72 A320neos from Airbus. SpiceJet is in talks for 150 aircraft and IndiGo, the nation’s biggest carrier, has ordered 430 Airbus narrow-body jets on top of more than the 100 it already flies. “There is a huge disconnect between what is required in terms of infrastructure, both physical and manpower, and what is being planned,” said Mr Kapil Kaul, South Asia CEO for Sydney-based Capa Centre for Aviation. “We are heading towards a serious infrastructure shortage but choose to ignore reality.” A new aviation policy unveiled in June by Mr Modi is also fuelling carriers’ expansion plans. In the making for more than a decade, it aims to revive hundreds of unused Indian airports, and provide subsidy to airlines that fly to remote areas. More routes, more planes mean more controllers. The problem is not just limited to India. By 2030, the world will need another 40,000 air traffic controllers to handle flights, according to the International Civil Aviation Organisation (Icao). Yet, there are so few training facilities in Asia — the fastest-growing travel market — that the region will have a deficit of more than 1,000 controllers each year, Icao said. The Indian government is in the process of hiring as many as 600 air traffic controllers, who will be trained at three facilities across the country, but only about 60 will be deployed in New Delhi, according to airport officials. The new policy has a passing mention of an intention to set up a “world-class training centre” for local and overseas air traffic officials. It still has no clear and well thought out strategy to build skills and capabilities, according to Capa.

The collaboration between NASA and private companies is part of the space agency’s Next Space Technologies for Exploration Partnerships (NextSTEP) set up to advance human space flight missions. But, the chance to enter to space won’t just be limited to just trained astronauts, NASA hinted. Jason Crusan, director of advanced exploration systems at NASA, said the NextSTEP partnerships were not just to advance deep space habitation development, but also for “stimulating commercial activities in low-Earth orbit.” In order for deep space habitats to be effective for human habitation, NASA lists several requirements, including: a pressurized container; a docking capability; environmental control; life support systems; crew health capabilities; fire safety technologies; logistics management; and radiation mitigation and monitoring. The six companies will have approximately two years to develop ground prototypes and will be subjected to systems and operations testing in order to define design standards. The six chosen American aerospace technology companies are: Bigelow Aerospace, Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Orbital ATK, Sierra Nevada Corporation’s Space Systems and NanoRacks. NASA’s push for deep space habitats is part of its obsession with the idea of life beyond Earth – their ultimate goal is to eventually send humans to Mars. NASA announced its Journey to Mars mission in 2010 and it starts of small; to live on an asteroid by 2025 and then the Red Planet by the 2030s. Videos and images from the propulsion tests into the Space Launch System were released this week. Space geeks worldwide marvelled in the massive flames bellowing from the rocket’s exhausts. The SLS will be the most powerful rocket to be built by NASA, and will be used to propel the Orion Spacecraft – which NASA says will take humans farther than they’ve ever gone before. ® Sponsored: The state of mobile security maturity Tips and corrections 36 Comments More from The Register NASA opens ISS to private sector modules The plan is to to build wider experience useful for Izzy's successor 17 Comments Jovial NASA says Juno flyby a success Downloads will take days 22 Comments NASA spools up ultra-high def aurora movie Illuminating 4K timelapse shot from ISS 10 Comments By Juno!

The trade show brings together representatives from all levels of government with aerospace companies big and small. "There will be peer-to-peer meetings, where you might get companies talking about how they can collaborate," said a spokesperson. "You might have supplier/buyer discussions happening. Certainly, the opportunity for those connections is there and we have a pretty good cross-section of representatives." The industry's biggest companies – such as Boeing, Airbus and Lockheed Martin – will be attending alongside smaller B.C.-based firms. The expo expects to match its previous attendance of approximately 400 people. "ADSE is very much a local event but with a provincial, national and international flavour," the spokesperson said. Lt.-Gen. Michael Hood, commander of the Royal Canadian Air Force, will be attending the expo and giving a speech. The CEO of WestJet, Gregg Saretsky, will also be attending and speaking. Local MLA and minister of finance Mike de Jong will be giving the keynote address on Friday.

Army-technology.com wraps up key headlines from July. Military coup attempt to oust government fails in Turkey The Turkish Armed Forces' violent attempt to take control of the country by suspending the constitution failed. At least 290 people were killed and more than 1,000 were injured as a result of the 48-hour coup, from 15 to 16 July. The coup attempt failed after the military-imposed curfew was strongly opposed by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's supporters. 84 people killed in truck attack in Nice, France A gunman reportedly linked to a militant group drove a truck into a crowd in Nice, France, killing nearly 84 people and injuring more than 50. The ‘terror attack’ occurred during the Bastille Day fireworks at the Promenade des Anglais on Thursday. The driver was shot dead by the police and the truck he was driving contained weapons and grenades, according to media sources. Nato to invest €3bn in defence technology until 2019 The Nato Communication and Information (NCI) Agency planned to invest €3bn in defence technology until 2019. The planned investments were expected to bolster Nato's cyber and air defence, satellite communications and response forces, as well as command and control for complex multinational operations. The agency will award contracts for the procurement of cyber, air and missile defence systems, as well as advanced software products. UK to lift ban on women in ground close combat roles The UK was set to lift ban on women serving in ground close combat roles in the British Armed Forces from 2016. Female soldiers will be allowed to join certain units of the Royal Armoured Corps (RAC) from November.  Women will be able to apply for combat roles in a phased approach over the next three years. UK Defence Secretary Michael Fallon said: "Women have already given exemplary service in recent conflicts, working in a variety of highly specialised and vital roles. By opening all combat roles to women, we will continue to build on these successes and improve the operational capability of our military." US and ROK to deploy THAAD system to counter North Korean missile threats The US and the Republic of Korea (ROK) joined forces to deploy the Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system. The THAAD system will be deployed to ROK to counter missile threats from North Korea. The decision on the THAAD deployment was based on the recommendations made by ROK Defence Minister Han, Min Gu and US Forces Korea commander general Vincent K Brooks, and approved by the ROK and US Governments. US to deploy more troops to support ISIS combat mission in Iraq US Defence Secretary Ash Carter announced the deployment of additional troops to support Iraqi forces in the fight against ISIS. According to Carter, 560 more personnel will be sent to Iraq to help local forces that aim to free Mosul from ISIS. The latest deployment will bring the number of US personnel in Iraq to more than 4,650, the BBC reported. The troops were expected to provide support in areas such as infrastructure and logistics at an airfield near Qayyarah. North Korea test-fires three ballistic missiles South Korea's Joint Chiefs Of Staff (JCS) reported that North Korea launched three ballistic missiles off its eastern coast. The JCS claimed the country had fired the missiles from an area near Hwangju region and they flew between 500km and 600km into the sea, media sources reported. The US military said that the latest launches involved two Scud missiles and one Rodong, Reuters reported. Boeing to supply 50 AH-64E Apache attack helicopters to British Army Boeing was to supply 50 AH-64E Apache attack helicopters to the British Army, as part of a $2.3bn deal between the US and UK governments. To be flown by Army Air Corps pilots from the Joint Helicopter Command, the new fleet of Apaches can carry more weapons and use fuel more efficiently than their predecessors. The first batch of helicopters was expected to be produced by 2020, and entered into service with the British Army in 2022. Otokar wins €106.1m contract to deliver COBRA II armoured vehicles Otokar was contracted to supply COBRA II tactical wheeled armoured vehicles to the Turkish security forces. The €106.1m order included COBRA II 4x4 tactical wheeled armoured vehicles, as well as maintenance and support systems. Otokar general manager Serdar Gorguc said: "Last year we were awarded the first two orders for Cobra II that we designed at Otokar with our own intellectual property rights and specifically against increasing threats. "Armed with our engineering capabilities and R&D strength, we will keep on providing state-of-the-art solutions for our users." BAE Systems to produce 32 BvS10 all-terrain vehicles for Austrian Army BAE Systems received a contract to build 32 armoured personnel carrier variant of the BvS10 military all-terrain vehicles for the Austrian Army. To be carried out under a government-to-government arrangement with Sweden, the contract will benefit Austria's mission in the European Union Mountain Training Warfare Initiative (EU MTI), which aims to enhance military effectiveness in mountainous terrains. The vehicles will be manufactured at BAE Systems Hägglunds in Örnsköldsvik, Sweden, with deliveries beginning in the second half of next year, and concluding in 2019.

NASA announced yesterday that it will partner with six private companies to refine deep space habitation solutions in advance of a possible Mars mission.  By Christina Beck, Staff August 10, 2016 Save for later Saved Concept image of Boeing's prototype habitation module. Boeing/NASA View Caption About video ads View Caption of The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has its sights set far beyond the moon, toward the mysteries of deep space. NASA announced Tuesday that as its mission objectives expand to human exploration of deep space, including planned missions to an asteroid in 2025, and Mars by 2030, it is working together with six US companies to help develop deep space habitats to support human exploration. “NASA is increasingly embracing public-private partnerships to expand capabilities, and opportunities in space,” said director of NASA’s Advanced Exploration Systems (AES), Jason Crusan, in a NASA press release when the program was first announced in 2015. “Our NextSTEP partners commit their own corporate resources toward the development – making them a true partner in the spaceflight economy.” Recommended: How well do you know the moon? Take our quiz! NASA announced NextSTEP in May, 2015 , in a Next Space Technologies for Exploration Partnerships (NextSTEP) Broad Agency Announcement. NASA later selected 12 projects to help innovate deep space solutions, including advanced propulsion, habitation, and small satellite projects. Test your knowledge How well do you know the moon? Take our quiz! Infographic Space Race, The Sequel: Who is exploring the cosmos today? Photos of the Day Photos of the day 11/23 Now, NASA has chosen six project proposals out of all the applications it received for the NextSTEP habitation project. It will be working with these six companies to innovate deep space habitation solutions in anticipation of a mission to Mars within the next few decades. The deep space habitats will be tested in an area near the moon, a “proving ground” before the planned mission to Mars, according to NASA scientists. Habitats will include features such as docking capabilities for spacecraft, life support systems, fire safety mechanisms, crew health capabilities, and radiation monitoring, among others, according to a NASA blog post. Once the habitats are constructed, NASA says, it will be able to test how the many systems involved (including airlocks, docking systems, etc.) function, and how they will function in deep space. Each of the six companies will work on a slightly different product. One of the most recognizable names, Boeing, has already worked on systems in use at the International Space System. The company says that it will use this experience to guide the creation of its habitat, which will include, “the production of a full-scale habitat that will provide design analysis and high-fidelity demonstration and test capability to simulate how humans can safely live and work in deep space for extended periods of time.” Lockheed Martin, another private company well known for its involvement in space technology innovation, plans to refurbish an existing multi-purpose logistics module. Orbital ATK also plans to work off an existing product, its initial cislunar habitat concept, based off the company’s Cygnus craft. Sierra Nevada Corporation’s Space Systems plans to modify its own Dream Chaser module and combine it with an inflatable fabric module and life support systems, while Bigelow Airspace LLC plans to develop a 330-cubic-meter inflatable habitat called the XBASE. According to NASA, “the testing conducted on this platform will advance approaches for deep space missions and serve as a basis for commercialization in low-Earth orbit.” Finally, lesser known Texas company NanoRacks plans to modify an existing launch vehicle’s second stage to convert into a habitat, which it says could be a low cost habitat solution. NASA says that these habitat plans will help inform the space agency’s approach to planned deep space explorations. “The activities of these NextSTEP awards will inform the acquisition and deployment approach for the next phase of flight systems for deep space including important aspects such as standards and interfaces, module configurations, and options for deployment utilizing SLS and Orion and commercial vehicles,” wrote NASA in a blog post. “In addition to U.S. Industry, NASA is in discussions on collaborative opportunities with our international partners to enable a robust fully operational deep space habitation capability."

The Boeing 737-800 came down in poor weather as it sought to land on March 19 killing all 55 passengers and seven crew. Aristos Socratous was the pilot of the FlyDubai jet which crashed in Russia, killing all 62 people on board Russian Emergency Ministry employees investigate the wreckage of a crashed plane at the Rostov-on-Don airport, about 600 miles south of Moscow, Russia on Sunday Until now, theories for the crash have included pilot error, crew exhaustion or technical problems, and these continue to be investigated. Earlier this year, a Russian media outlet reported that he had resigned due to an unbearable schedule - and that the flight was due to be one of his last.  Now, says Interfax news agency, the probe is also examining whether 'deliberate actions of the pilot might have caused the crash' of Flight FZ 981 from Dubai.

The last words of the doomed pilot... Revealed: Russia jet crash pilot was on his last flight... Share this article Share 137 shares An anonymous source was quoted as saying: 'A preliminary inquiry has determined that the Boeing 737-800 captain, who presumably was aware of his actions and properly assessed the situation and the aircraft's position relative to the ground, kept the control knob switched on for 12 seconds, so turning the horizontal stabilizer to the nosedive position.' The source stated that black box records show that captain Aristos Socratous, 38, ignored his co-pilot's questions over the practicability of his actions. 'To all of the co-pilot's questions, the captain responded that everything was okay. His tone was calm, and no nervousness is heard in his voice,' the source said. Emergencies Ministry members work at the crash site of a Boeing 737-800 Flight FZ981 operated by Dubai-based budget carrier FlyDubai Interfax said its source is aware of the course of investigation. Officially, the committee which uses the Russian abbreviation MAK, said it is unaware of the the suggestion that the pilot deliberately crashed the aircraft. 'MAK has nothing to do with this information so we cannot comment on it,' said a spokesman. The plane crashed after aborting its landing at an altitude of 220 metres possibly due to a sudden increase in wind speed, according to provisional findings of the investigation issued in April by the Interstate Aviation Committee, in charge of the probe. When the jet reached the altitude of 600 metres, the pilot pushed the control wheel off, thus producing a decrease of the vertical load factor and an automatic retraction of the flaps to 10 degrees. The pilot pulled the control wheel and continued the climb. At the altitude of 900 metres, the control column was pushed and the jet's stabiliser was turned for nosing-down, resulting in the Boeing's descent from an altitude of 1,000 metres. 'The later actions of the crew didn't make it possible to avoid staking into the ground,' the committee said in April. At his funeral in June, the pilot's cousin in a eulogy said: 'We lost one of the most important members of our family, our pillar.' Socratous was survived by a son born after the crash. The pilot was 'a very great man, dignified, principled, honest and kind-hearted,' she said at the ceremony held at St Nicholas church in Limassol. A view of the runway at the Rostov-on-Don airport where a FlyDubai Boeing 737-800 crashed The crash 'should and could have been avoided and responsibilities will be sought'. The Dubai-based budget airline was hit by claims that it forced exhausted pilots to fly dangerously long hours despite protests over safety. A leak of reports written by its pilots alleged the schedule left them dangerously fatigued. Flydubai denied the claims and stressed its first priority is safety. 'We operate to the highest standards,' said a spokesman.  The budget carrier FlyDubai launched in 2009, with a network of up to 90 destinations. They operate more than 1,700 flights each week. Its Facebook page says: 'From our hub in Dubai, we strive to remove barriers to travel and enhance connectivity between different cultures across our ever-expanding network. 'Our agility and flexibility as a young airline has enhanced Dubai's economic development, in line with the Government of Dubai's vision, by creating trade and tourism flows in previously under-served markets.'   Read more: Pilots ‘worked to death’: Flydubai whistleblower says fatigue-related crash predicted (RT EXCLUSIVE) — RT News Fatal crash pilot resigned over exhausting hours: report - Cyprus Mail Cyprus Mail Share or comment on this article e-mail 137 shares Most watched News videos Gruesome moment Korean chef dissects a LIVE octopus Mob storm police station and lynch suspected paedophile Cyclist films moment car causes him to crash then drives away Teen films a burning 'meteorite' moving across sky in Japan Shocking moment man hits women in mass chicken shop fight Supermodel Gigi Hadid fights off man who grabs her at Milan show Mystery homeless woman in Rome avoids questions from reporter Kim Kardashian attacked in Paris by notorious prankster 100 special police agents protect suspected paedophile from mob The moment a 7.4 magnitude earthquake hit Fukushima Doorman knocks-out troublemaker during two-on-one confrontation 'Die baby, die': Two women admit to 'dementia doll' abuse Six rebel electors have signed an agreement to try to block...

NASA is working with partners in its NextSTEP program to developed deep space habitats that will be used in future space research and exploration. Those partners have all now unveiled their ground prototypes for these modules. NASA previously selected six US firms to help expand the knowledge and commercial capability of space exploration by developing ground-based, full-size prototypes and concepts for deep space habitats under the NextSTEP program, specifically known as NextSTEP-2. “The NextSTEP partnerships are a large contribution to the dual objectives of advancing deep space habitation development and stimulating commercial activities in low-Earth orbit,” said Jason Crusan, Director of Advanced Exploration Systems at NASA Headquarters. The six partners that were selected include Bigelow Aerospace LLC from Las Vegas with its XBASE (Expandable Bigelow Advanced Station Enhancement) which is a 330 cubic meter expandable habitat. This is a newer version of that BEAM module from Bigelow that is currently in testing on the ISS. Boeing of Houston is showing off a modular habitat ground demonstrator that will allow the company to test and validate interface standards and other technologies. Bigelow Aerospace’s XBASE Lockheed Martin’s multi-purpose logistics module prototype Lockheed Martin of Denver, Colorado has plans to refurbish a multi-purpose logistics module such as those that were used to carry supplies to and from the ISS by the space shuttle into a full-scale habitat prototype with integrated avionics and ECLSS. Orin ATK plans to work on maturing the design of their cislunar habitat concept as on the Cygnus spacecraft that is servicing the space station now. Sierra Nevada Corp has a prototype based on the Dream Chaser cargo module that could be combined with an inflatable fabric environment module, ECLSS system, and propulsion system. The final company is Nanorocks that pans to perform a study on turning an existing launch vehicle upper stage, the propellant segment, into a pressurized space habitat.

Black Friday Tech Apple Science Cars Celebrity Movies Holiday Gifts Cyber Monday     NASA Selects Six Firms To Develop Habitats For Mars Mission Posted: Aug 10 2016, 1:23am CDT | by IANS, in News | Latest Science News   Concept image of the interior of a deep space habitat. Credits: NASA    In a bid to help advance the manned flight to Red Planet, the US space agency has selected six US companies to develop ground prototypes and concepts for deep space habitats. Don't Miss: Hatchimals in Stock at Walmart Habitation systems provide a safe place for humans to live as scientists move beyond Earth on the journey to Mars. Through the public-private partnerships enabled by the Next Space Technologies for Exploration Partnerships-2 (NextSTEP-2), NASA and industry partners will expand commercial development of space in low-Earth orbit while also improving deep space exploration capabilities to support more extensive human spaceflight missions. "NASA is on an ambitious expansion of human spaceflight, including the Journey to Mars, and we're utilizing the innovation, skill and knowledge of the both the government and private sectors," said Jason Crusan, director of NASA's Advanced Exploration Systems, in a statement. The next human exploration capabilities needed beyond the Space Launch System (SLS) rocket and Orion capsule are deep space, long duration habitation and in-space propulsion. "We are now adding focus and specifics on the deep space habitats where humans will live and work independently for months or years at a time, without cargo supply deliveries from Earth," Crusan added. The selected companies are Bigelow Aerospace, Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Orbital ATK, Sierra Nevada Corporation and NanoRacks. The six partners will have up to approximately 24 months to develop ground prototypes and/or conduct concept studies for deep space habitats. NASA has estimated the total of contract award amounts to be approximately $65 million. The ground prototypes will be used for three primary purposes: supporting integrated systems testing, human factors and operations testing and to help define overall system functionality. These are important activities as they help define the design standards, common interfaces, and requirements while reducing risks for the final flight systems that will come after this phase. NASA made the first NextSTEP selections in 2015, which include deep space habitation concept studies that also advance low-Earth orbit commercial capabilities. Four companies were selected under that solicitation: Bigelow Aerospace LLC, Boeing, Lockheed Martin and Orbital ATK. This round of NextSTEP selections will catalyze commercial investment in low-Earth orbit and lead to an operational deep space habitation capability in the area of space near the moon which will serve as the proving ground for Mars during the 2020s.

An MoU was signed by Air India Engineering Services CEO H R Jagannath and Spicejet vice president Arun Kashyap in the presence of top AI officials here yesterday. With the signing of the agreement, Spicejet will send its aircraft from the fleet of 42 planes to Nagpur MRO in immediate future, Kashyap told reporters during their visit to the MRO. Kashyap also said Spicejet was in the process of acquiring 100 more aircraft in the days to come. He said the first Spicejet aircraft was expected to roll in for MRO facility within two months. It was already sending its aircraft to GMR, Hyderabad, but now onwards, Spicejet will be using the MRO facility of Air India at Nagpur, he said.

Washington:  In a bid to help advance the manned flight to Red Planet, the US space agency has selected six US companies to develop ground prototypes and concepts for deep space habitats. Habitation systems provide a safe place for humans to live as scientists move beyond Earth on the journey to Mars. Through the public-private partnerships enabled by the Next Space Technologies for Exploration Partnerships-2 (NextSTEP-2), NASA and industry partners will expand commercial development of space in low-Earth orbit while also improving deep space exploration capabilities to support more extensive human spaceflight missions. "NASA is on an ambitious expansion of human spaceflight, including the Journey to Mars, and we're utilising the innovation, skill and knowledge of the both the government and private sectors," said Jason Crusan, director of NASA's Advanced Exploration Systems, in a statement. The next human exploration capabilities needed beyond the Space Launch System (SLS) rocket and Orion capsule are deep space, long duration habitation and in-space propulsion. "We are now adding focus and specifics on the deep space habitats where humans will live and work independently for months or years at a time, without cargo supply deliveries from Earth," Crusan added. The selected companies are Bigelow Aerospace, Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Orbital ATK, Sierra Nevada Corporation and NanoRacks. The six partners will have up to approximately 24 months to develop ground prototypes and/or conduct concept studies for deep space habitats. NASA has estimated the total of contract award amounts to be approximately $65 million. The ground prototypes will be used for three primary purposes: supporting integrated systems testing, human factors and operations testing and to help define overall system functionality. These are important activities as they help define the design standards, common interfaces, and requirements while reducing risks for the final flight systems that will come after this phase. NASA made the first NextSTEP selections in 2015, which include deep space habitation concept studies that also advance low-Earth orbit commercial capabilities. Four companies were selected under that solicitation: Bigelow Aerospace LLC, Boeing, Lockheed Martin and Orbital ATK. This round of NextSTEP selections will catalyse commercial investment in low-Earth orbit and lead to an operational deep space habitation capability in the area of space near the moon which will serve as the proving ground for Mars during the 2020s.

Now comes the hard part: finding qualified flight controllers to operate it. Designed by HOK, the same firm that drafted Apple’s research headquarters in California, the tower will be operational in about six months. Yet, it may struggle to handle more flights without enough controllers, according to aviation officials. The nation’s busiest airport needs 600 of the technicians ideally for stable operations, but employs only 360, the officials say. The world’s fastest-growing major aviation market is grappling with a paucity of traffic controllers to meet growing demand, as many of them shun employment with the state-run Airports Authority of India, where starting monthly salaries can be as low as US$250, and choose monetarily rewarding jobs with private airlines. About a third of India’s planned air-traffic controller positions are vacant, the government said last year. SpiceJet plans more India-China flights The shortfall has meant existing controllers are overworked. “It is a huge safety hazard,” said Mohan Ranganathan, a former commercial pilot and an independent aviation safety consultant based in the southern Indian city of Chennai. “The air traffic controllers are being flogged in violation of fatigue rules.” The dearth of talent in the world’s second-most populous country is threatening to reach crisis proportions as a slew of budget carriers unveil plans to add hundreds of aircraft to cater to the travel boom fueled by rising incomes and lower fares. Adding to the challenge is Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ambitious programmes to connect smaller towns and villages by air. Air India suspends pilot and flight attendants after ‘overstay in cockpit’ The situation came to a head when the US Federal Aviation Administration downgraded India’s aviation safety rating in 2014, concluding the nation couldn’t find enough officials to ensure safe operation of flights. The US regulator said India’s oversight processes don’t meet global standards, putting the country on par with Zimbabwe. The ranking was restored a year later following some corrective action to address shortcomings. Even so, the air-traffic controller shortage will only intensify in the coming years as local carriers buy more planes. Boeing estimates India will need 1,850 aircraft valued at US$265 billion over the next two decades. At least 709 planes are already on order. Go Airlines India said it will buy 72 A320 neos from Airbus at Farnborough last month. Air India flight to London returns to Mumbai after rat spotted on board SpiceJet is in talks for 150 aircraft and IndiGo, the nation’s biggest carrier, has ordered 430 Airbus narrow-body jets on top of more than the 100 it already flies. “There is a huge disconnect between what is required in terms of infrastructure, both physical and manpower, and what is being planned,” said Kapil Kaul, South Asia CEO for Sydney-based CAPA Centre for Aviation. “We are heading towards a serious infrastructure shortage but choose to ignore reality.” A new aviation policy unveiled in June by Modi is also fueling carriers’ expansion plans. In the making for more than a decade, it aims to revive hundreds of unused Indian airports, and provide subsidy to airlines that fly to remote areas. More routes, more planes mean more controllers. The problem is not just limited to India. By 2030, the world will need another 40,000 air traffic controllers to handle flights, according to the International Civil Aviation Organisation. Terminal illness: The ghost airports in India where the only thing that flies are the pigeons Yet, there are so few training facilities in Asia, the fastest-growing travel market, that the region will have a deficit of more than 1,000 controllers each year, ICAO said. The Indian government is in the process of hiring as many as 600 air traffic controllers, who will be trained at three facilities across the country, but only about 60 will be deployed to New Delhi, according to airport officials. The new policy has a passing mention of an intention to set up a “world-class training centre” for local and overseas air-traffic officials. It still has no clear and well thought out strategy to build skills and capabilities, according to CAPA. “It is surprising that the ministry of civil aviation hasn’t felt the need for more stringent supervision and review of manpower,” said Jitender Bhargava, a former executive director of flag carrier Air India. “The problem is systemic and unless accountability is introduced, the vicious cycle of shortages will continue.” This article appeared in the South China Morning Post print edition as: India’s air traffic controller shortage sends shock waves   Most Popular Viewed 1 Xi Jinping gives nod to work of Hong Kong government and urges CY to be ‘resolute’ in safeguarding national unity 2 CY Leung’s mobile phone number among billions ‘leaked’ by smartphone security apps 3 Abercrombie & Fitch to shut Hong Kong store in wake of economic downturn 4 What Hong Kong has to learn from the rise and fall of Manila 5 India’s China policy off target, says Modi’s Mandarin-speaking ‘guided missile’ Shared 1 Abercrombie & Fitch to shut Hong Kong store in wake of economic downturn 2 CY Leung’s mobile phone number among billions ‘leaked’ by smartphone security apps 3 What Hong Kong has to learn from the rise and fall of Manila 4 Xi Jinping gives nod to work of Hong Kong government and urges CY to be ‘resolute’ in safeguarding national unity 5 Chinese defence ministry on high alert as fighting breaks out in Myanmar border towns Commented 1 Xi Jinping gives nod to work of Hong Kong government and urges CY to be ‘resolute’ in safeguarding national unity 2 Xi tells Duterte that Scarborough Shoal will stay open to Philippine fishermen 3 Don’t read too much into handshakes with Beijing leaders for Hong Kong’s chief executive race 4 Too early to ‘grade’ CY Leung’s performance, engineer group contesting Election Committee polls says 5 CY Leung’s mobile phone number among billions ‘leaked’ by smartphone security apps Promotions Register for a free copy of XXIV 2017 now Register for a free copy of Home Essentials 2017 now       You may also like Hong Kong ‘The future of Hong Kong is not ours’: Minority groups feel shut out of one of Asia’s richest cities 19 Nov 2016 - 9:23am 28 Dazzling festivals throughout December: Macau’s seasonal delights to light up the city In partnership with Macao Government Tourism Office Post Magazine The complex origins of Chinese names demystified 18 Nov 2016 - 3:25pm 5 Good Eating Win dinner for two 16 Nov 2016 - 12:19pm The weird and wild toilets of history, and the progress in getting them to everyone 19 Nov 2016 - 12:06pm 1 China China, US hold joint military drills in Southern China Nov 19th 2016, 8:44pm 1 China More doubts cast over Chinese scientist’s claim of gene editing tool ‘breakthrough’ 17 Nov 2016 - 10:21pm 2 Hong Kong Chinese government rebukes US over comments on Hong Kong removal of legislators-elect 17 Nov 2016 - 11:45pm 90 China Trump expected to welcome Chinese investment in US, despite threatening tough tariffs on country’s products 16 Nov 2016 - 8:43am 5 Game changes in Hong Kong’s Legislative Council after ban of two localist lawmakers 17 Nov 2016 - 11:15am 67 Hong Kong Joseph Lau slams ‘greedy’ ex-girlfriend in video interview, confirms he wrote newspaper statement about breakup 16 Nov 2016 - 9:11pm 12 Hong Kong Dream of owning a home is over for most young Hong Kong people 15 Nov 2016 - 11:29pm 43 South China Morning Post Stay connected Facebook Twitter Hong Kong Politics Economy Health & Environment Law & Crime Education & Community News China Hong Kong Asia World China Policies & Politics Diplomacy & Defence Money & Wealth Society Economy Tech Business Companies Markets Property Investor Relations Mutual Funds Economy China Economy Money & Wealth Country Reports Tech China Tech Enterprises Social & Gadgets Start-ups Apps & Gaming Innovation Leaders & Founders Science & Research E-Commerce Lifestyle Arts & Entertainment Health & Beauty Film & TV Food & Drink Families Music Fashion & Luxury Books Travel & Leisure Watches Sport Hong Kong China Golf Racing Rugby Soccer Tennis Boxing Comment Insight & Opinion Harry's View Blogs Polls Letters Multimedia Video Photos Infographics SCMP Chronicles Magazine Post Magazine Style Good Eating Destination Macau HK Magazine Archive Other Weather Most Popular 7 Days Index Country Reports Crossword Promotions Directories Luxehomes At your service Business Services Directory MICE Biz Restaurant Directory Information Buy SCMP Photos Copyright Licensing RSS Feeds SCMP.com search Historical Archive Print Subscription Advertising Opportunities Contact our Advertising Sales HK Rate card Overseas Rate Card China Rate Card The Marketer SCMP Marketing Solutions SCMP Outdoor Advertising Recruitment Advertising Events SCMP Events Operation Santa Claus Other Sites CPJobs.com Education Post Young Post Cosmopolitan CosmoGIRL!

By Elizabeth Howell, Discovery News | August 10, 2016 12:26am ET MORE A mirror inspection of the James Webb Space Telescope, scheduled to launch in 2018. Credit: NASA/David Higginbotham What's happening in our universe? In the 400 years since we first started using telescopes, we've been trying to answer this question. The past two decades alone have been dizzying: Planets found outside the solar system, a universe accelerating in its expansion, and hints of the mysterious dark energy and dark matter that make up most of the universe, to name a handful of historic discoveries. But to see further, we often need to spend big. RELATED: Covers Off! Say Hello to Our Future Mega-Space Telescope There's been much coverage of the more than $9 billion James Webb Space Telescope that will launch in 2018, to probe planetary atmospheres and to look back at the universe's beginnings. What will come next? Looking a bit ahead, the astronomy organization AURA suggests a "High Definition Space Telescope" to launch in 2035, an observatory double Webb's size. But how this would be paid for comes under scrutiny in a new report. Harvard astrophysicist Martin Elvis' new paper in Space Policy to try to solve what he calls the astronomy "funding wall." Our hunger for greater telescopes in X-ray emissions alone, he argues, has made the cost of this mission type increase 20 times in the past generation. (Yes, that's after adjusting for inflation.) Moreover, space missions often go over their budget before launch. "At some point the costs are more than a government can abide," he wrote. "Particle physics hit its funding wall in the U.S. when the Superconducting Super-Collider, already far along in construction in Texas, went over budget one too many times and was cancelled. Is astronomy next?" The Hubble Space Telescope is still operational after more than 25 years in space, but it won't last forever. The telescope was designed to be serviced by the now-defunct space shuttle program. Credit: NASA JWST may already be testing the limits, he added. Its cost growth led to repeated threats of cancellation, but the mission has been replanned to try to avoid this. Elvis said that NASA has a budget of just $5 billion per decade for large new space telescopes. "Each JWST-class mission thus takes 100% of nearly 20 years of this funding line," he said, pointing out the successor mission of the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST) could be similar in cost to JWST. What Can Giant Telescopes Teach Us About Our Universe? He also worries that focusing on a single, large telescope will make NASA's program lose its robustness. Right now we have three "Great Observatories" -- the Hubble Space Telescope, the Spitzer space telescope, and the Chandra X-Ray Observatory -- operating in different wavelengths: visual, infrared and X-ray. We need to study the same object in different wavelengths to properly understand it. The youngest of these telescopes is 13 years old and will eventually fail during JWST's lifetime; JWST is most sensitive in infrared and follow-up observations in X-rays, Elvis argues, would need to wait. RELATED: Top 10 Astronomical Discoveries Of All Time But before worrying overmuch, Elvis proposes a solution: to depend more on the commercial space sector. Think about how much it has changed human spaceflight in the last decade. Now we have regular cargo runs to the International Space Station; in SpaceX's case, occasionally these missions have been able to land their rockets for future re-use. And very soon, SpaceX and Boeing will be sending astronauts aloft on their own spacecraft. What is the prospect for astronomy? NASA is trying to learn more about the universe to, in part, figure out the conditions for breeding life. At left is an artist's conception of Earth, compared with an artist's conception of the faraway Kepler-452b (a rocky planet bigger than Earth). Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech/T. Pyle He argues that commercial spacecraft (which are more likely to see cost driven down by competition) would see quick advances in a few areas. Costs in launch, spacecraft and payloads would reduce, mainly because we are making a lot of advances today to reduce the mass hefted to orbit. In space, mass is one of the major costs. "Cutting spacecraft cost by a factor 2, along with launch costs by a factor 3, would roughly halve the cost of a flagship mission," he said. "This would radically alter flagship mission decisions, by doubling the number that could be launched each decade." RELATED: Can Future Telescopes See The Edge Of The Universe? Elvis also argues that as private tourists spend time in orbit, the demand would lower the cost for low-Earth orbit missions and provide more access for astronomers. How this would be done still needs to be worked out (the Bigelow module on the space station has no platform for telescopes, for example.) More locations could open up across the solar system with private lunar landers and asteroid prospectors, too. You can read about these arguments, and Elvis' vision for spaceflight in the 2020s and beyond as we expand across the solar system, in his paper "What can Space Resources do for Astronomy and Planetary Science?"

Photo: AFP New Delhi: India has just plowed $50 million in a new 102-metre air-traffic control tower in New Delhi. Now comes the hard part: finding qualified flight controllers to operate it. Designed by HOK, the same firm that drafted Apple Inc.’s research headquarters in California, the tower will be operational in about six months. Yet, it may struggle to handle more flights without enough controllers, according to aviation officials. The nation’s busiest airport needs 600 of the technicians ideally for stable operations, but employs only 360, the officials say. The world’s fastest-growing major aviation market is grappling with a paucity of traffic controllers to meet growing demand, as many of them shun employment with the state-run Airports Authority of India, where starting monthly salaries can be as low as $250, and choose monetarily rewarding jobs with private airlines. About a third of India’s planned air-traffic controller positions are vacant, the government said last year. The shortfall has meant existing ATCs are overworked. “It is a huge safety hazard,” said Mohan Ranganathan, a former commercial pilot and an independent aviation safety consultant based in Chennai. “The air traffic controllers are being flogged in violation of fatigue rules.” Safety rating The dearth of talent in the world’s second-most populous country is threatening to reach crisis proportions as a slew of budget carriers unveil plans to add hundreds of aircraft to cater to the travel boom fueled by rising incomes and lower fares. Adding to the challenge is Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ambitious programmes to connect smaller towns and villages by air. The situation came to a head when the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) downgraded India’s aviation safety rating in 2014, concluding the nation couldn’t find enough officials to ensure safe operation of flights. The US regulator said India’s oversight processes don’t meet global standards, putting the country on par with Zimbabwe. The ranking was restored a year later following some corrective action to address shortcomings. Expanding fleets Even so, the air-traffic controller shortage will only intensify in the coming years as local carriers buy more planes. Boeing Co. estimates India will need 1,850 aircraft valued at $265 billion over the next two decades. At least 709 planes are already on order. Go Airlines India Pvt. said it will buy 72 A320neos from Airbus Group SE at Farnborough last month. SpiceJet Ltd. is in talks for 150 aircraft and IndiGo, the nation’s biggest carrier, has ordered 430 Airbus narrow-body jets on top of more than the 100 it already flies. “There is a huge disconnect between what is required in terms of infrastructure, both physical and manpower, and what is being planned,” said Kapil Kaul, South Asia CEO for Sydney-based CAPA Centre for Aviation. “We are heading towards a serious infrastructure shortage but choose to ignore reality.” A new aviation policy unveiled in June by Modi is also fueling carriers’ expansion plans. In the making for more than a decade, it aims to revive hundreds of unused Indian airports, and provide subsidy to airlines that fly to remote areas. More routes, more planes mean more controllers. Few facilities The problem is not just limited to India. By 2030, the world will need another 40,000 air traffic controllers to handle flights, according to the International Civil Aviation Organization. Yet, there are so few training facilities in Asia, the fastest-growing travel market, that the region will have a deficit of more than 1,000 controllers each year, ICAO said. The Indian government is in the process of hiring as many as 600 air traffic controllers, who will be trained at three facilities across the country, but only about 60 will be deployed in New Delhi, according to airport officials. The new policy has a passing mention of an intention to set up a “world-class training centre” for local and overseas air-traffic officials. It still has no clear and well thought out strategy to build skills and capabilities, according to CAPA. “It is surprising that the ministry of civil aviation hasn’t felt the need for more stringent supervision and review of manpower,” said Jitender Bhargava, a former executive director of flag carrier Air India. “The problem is systemic and unless accountability is introduced, the vicious cycle of shortages will continue.” Bloomberg Anurag Kotoky Topics: Air traffic controllerAviationAirports Authority of IndiaControl towerUS FAA More from this Section Karnataka realizes 1.8% projects signed before biennial investors meet Govt reaches out to opposition to break logjam in Parliament over note ban Karnataka govt appoints retired judge to probe suicide of DySP Ganapathy Cabinet push for Jawahar Navodaya schools, new merchant shipping bill Sartaj Aziz to visit India in December for Heart of Asia conference Editor's Picks New income tax rules to curb unaccounted cash The richest 1% of Indians now own 58.4% of wealth Reliance Jio fails to hit subscriber base of Airtel, Idea, Vodafone: analysts Tracking demonetisation: Our reading list India may gain from Donald Trump’s TPP pullout threat First Published: Wed, Aug 10 2016. 09 44 AM IST Read more from Livemint Shapoorji Pallonji to buy 100 acres land in affordable housing push Karnataka realizes 1.8% projects signed before biennial investors meet The propaganda of currency patriotism Editor's Picks New income tax rules to curb unaccounted cash The richest 1% of Indians now own 58.4% of wealth Reliance Jio fails to hit subscriber base of Airtel, Idea, Vodafone: analysts Latest News Shapoorji Pallonji to buy 100 acres land in affordable housing push Karnataka realizes 1.8% projects signed before biennial investors meet The propaganda of currency patriotism Airlines brace for demonetisation headwinds by advancing flash sales Govt reaches out to opposition to break logjam in Parliament over note ban Mint On Sunday The dilemma of Draupadī’s disrobing The prodigals return to Neroca US elections: How slogans can make or break a candidate Now, the crowd can bankroll your research How to maximize judicial time Home Companies Opinion Industry Politics Consumer Lounge Multimedia Money Sitemap Subscribe Contact Us Mint Code Privacy policy Terms of Use Advertising Mint Apps About Us Syndication Mint on Sunday RSS Hindustan Times Desimartini Copyright © 2016 HT Media Ltd.

US Army Cadets Ordered to Walk a Mile in HeelsA new policy is expected to be put in place by Pentagon officials later this year, which upends the standard “tape test” that measures body mass index. Instead, new technology will be put into use to distinguish between those who are obese and those, such as bodybuilders, who have nontraditional body types, but are fit for duty. “When you have groups of individuals who are fit and highly trained, then BMI is absolutely useless,” Dr. Dympna Gallagher, director of the body composition unit at the New York Obesity Nutrition Research Center, told Military Times. Currently, the military requires troops to maintain fat levels below 26 percent for men and 36 percent for women. The standards are currently shrinking the pool of potential recruits, as recent studies have confirmed that 75 percent of young Americans are ineligible for service because of their weight. © Flickr/ Canadian Pacific Not So Fat! Boeing Jets Forced to Fly Shorter Distances Due to Passengers' ObesityInstead, officials are looking to determine locations of body fat on an individual, to determine fitness levels. “Is it visceral fat around the abdominal organs? Or is it total body fat?” a defense official who spoke to the Military Times on a condition of anonymity said. “So the goal is to try to determine, based on the science, how do you test — in hundreds of thousands of individuals — the type of fat they have, in a manner that is quick and attainable and is relevant to health?” Some officials have expressed concerns that the military will be at a disadvantage on the battlefield if they lower standards through the use of the new policies. A study of troops in Afghanistan found that those who are overweight are 40 percent more likely to be injured while deployed. “If we do that, we have a potential liability on the battlefield. The minute we lose that competitive advantage in combat because our enemies are training harder than we are, we’ll have more problems than we have right now,” Command Sgt. Maj. John Troxell said. ...

Pigs are fat, and they are rounded and hard. Most of so called fat people, don't look or feel anything like that. They are soft and flabby. I think it's human cellular waste, that the body either can't get rid of, because it's overloaded as it is, dealing with everything else, or it's just a protective cushion for injured muscles, even if injuries are minor or microscopic.

(Jacob Barker/CBC) A U.S. Air Force plane sometimes used to transport the vice-president touched down in Happy Valley-Goose Bay today. The plane — which is known as Air Force Two when being used by the American vice-president — landed in the early afternoon, and reportedly took off and landed more than once. The plane is a Boeing C-32, a modification of Boeing's 757 passenger aircraft, and is regularly used by the vice-president of the United States, as well as the first lady and the secretary of state. The plane has also been used by presidents when landing at smaller airports that can't accommodate the jumbo jets used as Air Force One. U.S. Air Force officials were mum about who was on board as well as the purpose of the stop.  With files from Jacob Barker.

By AndyPasztor Despite efforts to foster competition for launching Pentagon spacecraft, senior Air Force and intelligence officials aren’t ready to launch their biggest, most advanced spy satellites on top of Space Exploration Technologies Corp.’s Falcon 9 rockets. With the beefed-up Falcon 9 not expected to be certified for military missions until 2017 at the earliest, Pentagon brass have opted for the familiar, though substantially more expensive, option of continuing to put such satellites on proven rockets built by the incumbent rival to SpaceX, as the Southern California company is called. That’s the upshot of the U.S. military’s decision to move toward awarding a pair of sole-source launch contracts to United Launch Alliance, a joint venture between Boeing Co. BA, +0.00%   and Lockheed Martin Corp. LMT, -0.24%   United Launch builds heavy-lift Delta IV rockets that have been the mainstay of the Pentagon’s National Reconnaissance Office, in addition to other boosters for smaller payloads. Announced last week, the decision covers spy-satellite launches slated between 2020 and 2023. Closely held SpaceX, founded by billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk, in the past has pushed hard to be able to compete for Pentagon launches across the board, even filing suit against the Air Force two years ago to protest being shut out of such business. The litigation was dropped after Pentagon officials pledged to open up competition for future launch contracts. An expanded version of this report appears on WSJ.com.

Meet the Contributors → WA State’s Healthcare Transformation Checkup: How Are We Feeling Today? Opinion Rob Arnold Opinion August 9th, 2016 @xconomy Like Us Xconomy Seattle —  We all know (or should know by now) that healthcare is undergoing a historic transformation into a digital consumer service. Consumers will soon expect to comparison shop health providers the same as they would for travel, banking, real estate or consumer goods. Health providers that develop the right formula of value—publishing reference pricing and outcomes data, for example—and innovation—such as next-gen health and wellness tools and precision medical treatments—stand to make the biggest gains. As impressive as all these upcoming technical innovations are, consumers are simultaneously speeding towards staggeringly expensive healthcare costs and high-deductible health plans. So which is more important to healthcare stakeholders, technological innovations or cost control? Can the former lead to the latter? As this new healthcare innovation world reveals itself, it’s increasingly clear that healthcare stakeholders need to view innovations through a “quad aim” prism of lowered costs, improved care, as well as more satisfied patients and providers at the same time. Innovations that fail to hit the quad aim, at least in the short term, may have a very difficult time making it to market. Consumers, governments, and employers need to keep the pressure on to make sure quad aim healthcare benefits are realized. Data transparency for things such as reference pricing for services, care outcomes, and consumer satisfaction information are essential to successful healthcare transformation. According to Bessemer Venture Partners, this consumer, digital transformation of healthcare will result in $1 trillion of economic value changing hands. There’s a lot at stake, and much to gain for communities that get this right. Given the Seattle region’s world class expertise in consumer engagement (Amazon, Starbucks, Costco), cloud computing (Amazon and Microsoft), and life science research (University of Washington, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, the Institute for Systems Biology, Allen Institute for Brain Science, and many others), I’ve been wondering how our region compares to other innovation clusters pursuing this opportunity. For this analysis, I reviewed five primary activities in our State: Life science research: Are we creating new care models and tools? Health system/insurance engagement: Are the health systems and insurers engaged and committed to testing, validating, and scaling new models? Government/employer engagement: Are our state and local governments and large employers providing incentives to drive innovation forward? Startups and innovation investments: Do we have the entrepreneurs and investment capital needed to exploit opportunities and create next-generation healthcare jobs? People and education: Do we have people with the passion, know-how, and expertise to deliver this precision health and medicine future? Here’s what I’ve learned so far. Life science research: Our state ranks 13th in research funding according to Research America. According to Genetic Engineering News, UW ranks fourth in NIH funding. Grade: A—Clearly life science research continues to be a bright spot in our state. Health system/insurance engagement: I reviewed programs currently under development at Cambia Grove, Providence Innovation Center and Fund, UW, and Puget Sound High Value Network. Cambia and Providence were the two first movers in our area to develop an innovation agenda. Both programs have a lot to share about the opportunities and challenges with healthcare innovation. Although both programs offer great potential, it’s hard to assess what kind of impact they will ultimately have at this early stage. UW Medicine is paying close attention to innovation and is experimenting with programs such as palliative care, telemedicine, and the recently launched Primary Care Innovation Lab. The Puget Sound High Value Network is a new entrant with innovation on the agenda. They have a great opportunity to make an impact in care coordination as well as develop innovations for use in their network. We’ll see how this story unfolds. To get a sense of where Washington ranks in terms of healthcare costs, we still fall in the middle of the pack (ranked 27th in the nation) although some systems are reporting they’ve been able to reduce costs back to 2009 rates which is very encouraging. Grade: Too early to grade Government/employer engagement: For this analysis, I looked into the state’s $65 million, five-year award to set up an Accountable Care Network funded by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. Since CMS pays 20 cents of every healthcare dollar (total government healthcare spending is 65 cents of every dollar), they have a vested interest in ensuring quad aim innovations are successful. CMS is actively accelerating innovations related to: broad payment and practice reform in primary care and specialty care; care coordination between providers of services and suppliers; community-based health teams to support chronic care management; and, improved quality and reduced cost through collaborations that support practice transformation. Although this work is still fairly new in Washington, there is growing evidence that this program is on the right track with health systems in eastern and central Washington. I’ve also been very impressed with the work of the state-sponsored Bree Collaborative. Bree Collaborative was formed in 2011 by request of then-Gov. Christine Gregoire to look for ways to improve the quality, consistency, and cost effectiveness of care. On the employer side, The Boeing Company has certainly been forward thinking about the accountable care organization model, and the City of Kirkland is pushing forward with value-based primary care through Vera Whole Health. Grade: B Startups and innovation investments: This topic continues to be good news/bad news for Washington State. The good news is that we do have some real innovators in our community. To name a few, companies like Juno and Adaptive Biotechnologies are leading the way in biotech. Accolade, Limeade, Vera Whole Health, and Arivale are taking on healthcare care transformation. And IT innovators such as Carena Health, TransformativeMed, and Clario Medical—the latter two are clients of my consulting firm—are working hard to improve clinical service specialties. Established funds such as Arch Venture Partners, Maveron, Cambia Health Solutions, Providence Ventures, and Columbia Pacific Management continue to lead the way on new investments. We are also seeing new funds and angel groups forming such as Dave Chases’s QuadAim Fund and Tobin Arthur’s AngelMD. Additionally, we’re seeing more investment activities coming from UW, Fred Hutch, ISB, and support for innovation in the South Sound at Madigan Army Medical Center, UW Tacoma, and MultiCare. On the national funding stage, Washington state companies didn’t fare as well. Only 5 percent of the funding from the top 20 healthcare technology investors ended up here (at least as of the end of 2014). This may be in part that our innovation portfolio is not far enough down the commercialization track to warrant bigger investment dollars. It may also be that our local companies are not pitching the larger investment funds. Either way, there seems to be a disconnection between our high volume of research funding and our low commercialization output. Grade: C+—I know our community is capable of better work! People and education: For this analysis, I reviewed our local startups, their employee base, and funding stage with the help of Kevin Cable at Cascadia Capital. I also researched and met with our local educational institutions developing new curriculum aimed at educating next-generation entrepreneurs, digital marketing experts, and sales professionals. This is another good news/bad news story for our region. The good news is that I continue to be impressed with the smart, talented, and motivated individuals I’ve met at UW programs such as Engineering in Medicine and the Healthcare Innovation Challenge. We have incredible talent coming through the pipeline. The bad news is that healthcare innovation job opportunities are still lacking and I’m worried the talent we are educating might not stay here. We also seem to fall short on the fully engaged, “been there/done that” commercialization professionals needed to take products to market. The shortage of experienced people and capital seem correlated. We need a bigger, bolder innovation pipeline to attract the later stage talent and capital we need for our region to compete on a national level. Grade: C+ Summary Recommendations: We have potential for quick wins with government/employer incentives and health systems opening up to more pilot innovations: More incentive dollars from governments and employers could move quad aim innovation faster in our health systems. It’s important to remember that federal incentives paid for health records to be digitized. We are now at 99 percent coverage. Incentives do work. In exchange for more incentives, I would push for transparent and easy access to reference pricing and outcomes data to make sure consumers can make informed choices on where they get affordable, high-quality care. I would also love to see our Washington health systems learn how to run pilot tests more efficiently. Philadelphia, Nashville, and Chicago are forging ahead in this area. We should study those models and apply those lessons quickly. We also need to work much harder to convince startups, commercialization professionals, and investors that Washington State is a credible place to create and grow a successful healthcare business. To accomplish this, we need better coordination between state government, employers, health systems, and insurers committed to testing, purchasing and scaling quad aim innovations such as software, devices, diagnostics, and drugs. I have no doubt with better coordination and better aligned incentives, we can attract great startups, investors, and commercialization professionals to our community. When innovation and commercialization are done right, we know the payoff for our region will pay dividends for decades to come.

By Ananya Roy August 9, 2016 08:09 BST Close Embed Feed Malaysia Airlines MH370 search to be suspended Reuters <iframe src="http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/videos/embed/19485" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe> The doomed Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 could have dropped from a height of 35,000ft at a speed of up to 20,000ft a minute before it finally crashed into the southern Indian Ocean, analysis of automated flight signals from the missing aircraft showed. The chief of the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) has said the findings corroborate the assumption that the plane could be located in the designated 120,000sq km seafloor. Defence scientists thoroughly studied the automated signals — dubbed handshakes — sent by the missing flight during its final moments to a satellite linked to a ground station in Perth and found that the plane crashed into the sea after running out of fuel. They also found that its two engines burst out — the first was the left engine followed by the right, which flamed out in the next 15 minutes. Pointing to the new theories that have surfaced in the resent past that the pilot of the plane, Zaharie Ahmad Shah, could have glided the plane farther away from the designated search area, MH370 search programme director Peter Foley said the search location was not ascertained based on theories, but on "hard facts" found following months of analysis of signals transmitted by the flight. The automated signal system, which is designed to provide data about the status of airplane parts like engines, reportedly indicated that just after midnight on 8 March, 2014, MH370 took off from Kuala Lumpur and headed for Beijing, with "goodnight" being the last heard radio message from the crew. Signals picked up by Malaysian military radar showed the aircraft making two turns that took it back over the Malaysian Peninsula. But there was further evidence that pointed to at least one more turn that the plane took at the northwest tip of Sumatra towards the southern Indian Ocean, which was most likely made by the conscious pilot. Seven automated connections received from the flight helped investigators ascertain that the missing Boeing 777 was still flying long after it lost contact with ground control office. Two satellite phone calls made to the plane after it went off radar went unanswered, but defence scientists confirmed the plane was heading south at that time, the Australian reported. Investigators said automated signals from the missing MH370 flight showed it fell from a height of 35,000ft at a very high speedReuters It was the seventh signal that was out of sequence and helped investigators conclude that the plane ran out of fuel from that instant and one of its two engines flamed out. ATSB chief commissioner Greg Hood said the analysis of these automated signals back the investigators' theory that the plane was not manned and crashed into the ocean following fuel exhaustion. He added that extensive testing by Boeing concluded that the plane dived from 35,000ft at a speed ranging between 12,000 and 20,000ft per minute. However, an aircraft making a normal landing descends at a speed of 2,000ft a minute. The defence scientists also found that the crash took place at 8.19am (WA time) on 9 March, 2014, since when the Beijing-bound plane with 238 passengers and crew members has remained untraceable. Foley told The Australian that a Defence Science and Technology Group team headed by Neil Gordon was a crucial part of the search team. He added that the ATSB had always kept an open mind with regard to the MH370 search.

It would be recalled that the United Kingdom’s (UK) Serious Fraud Office recently opened a criminal investigation into allegations of fraud, bribery and corruption relating to some of its third-party consultants. In Nigeria, First Nation Airline uses Airbus plane on its domestic routes.Olaitan said that such allegations were meant to be resolved in a manner that it would not impact on the production line and bookings by airlines, given the significant role they play in an economy. However, founder of aviation consulting firm, Endau Analytics, Malaysia, Shukor Yusof, said that the investigations would have negative impact.“Third-party consultants or intermediaries have often caused worries. The business of aircraft sale is so intense and competitive that there are people trying many avenues,” he said. The Toulouse, France-based plane maker said in a statement that it would cooperate with investigators probing its civil aviation business. Airbus had flagged to UK regulators and the European Export Credit Agencies earlier this year “misstatements and omissions” involving the outside contractors in some export financing applications, which it found through an internal probe. The credit agencies, including UK Export Finance have suspended some of the backstop financing that Airbus uses to help sell commercial aircraft since the first revelations made four months ago. Airbus said in a July 27 statement that a process for re-establishing export credit “has been agreed and is ongoing.” Until the financing is restored, Airbus and rival Boeing Co. face the challenge of navigating an uncertain market with limited government assistance. Chicago-based Boeing has been unable to tap trade financing because a congressional impasse has left the U.S. Export-Import bank with too few directors to approve deals. Jefferies Equity Research estimates that export-credit agencies last year provided seven per cent of financing for Airbus plane deliveries, compared with 45 per cent from leasing companies and 40 per cent from airlines themselves.

Doomed Malaysian Airlines flight MH370 has been found to have taken a catastrophic dive, extensive analysis by defence scientists has revealed. Defence scientists' theory fits with analysis of the signals sent out automatically between the aircraft and satellites. In the aircraft's final moments it is understood to have taken a plunge falling 20,000 feet a minute before plowing in to the Indian Ocean off Western Australia. Briefings by the aircraft's manfacturer Boeing indicate the plane would have slowed and lost lift once the engine power was lost, with the nose of the plane dipping, peaking briefly and then descending, the Australian Business Review reported. The Australian reported that a series of briefings revealed this process would have happened a few times before the aircraft dove nose-first in a "fugoid motion in a series of downward swoops". Scientist's believe the impact would have been catastrophic. Little wreckage of the missing aircraft has been found since it slipped off aviation radars in 2014. - NZ Herald By Aimee Shaw Email Print Get the news delivered straight to your inbox Receive the day’s news, sport and entertainment in our daily email newsletter SIGN UP NOW Loading Currency Compare and convert world currencies.

It would be recalled that the United Kingdom’s (UK) Serious Fraud Office recently opened a criminal investigation into allegations of fraud, bribery and corruption relating to some of its third-party consultants. In Nigeria, First Nation Airline uses Airbus plane on its domestic routes.Olaitan said that such allegations were meant to be resolved in a manner that it would not impact on the production line and bookings by airlines, given the significant role they play in an economy. However, founder of aviation consulting firm, Endau Analytics, Malaysia, Shukor Yusof, said that the investigations would have negative impact.“Third-party consultants or intermediaries have often caused worries. The business of aircraft sale is so intense and competitive that there are people trying many avenues,” he said. The Toulouse, France-based plane maker said in a statement that it would cooperate with investigators probing its civil aviation business. Airbus had flagged to UK regulators and the European Export Credit Agencies earlier this year “misstatements and omissions” involving the outside contractors in some export financing applications, which it found through an internal probe. The credit agencies, including UK Export Finance have suspended some of the backstop financing that Airbus uses to help sell commercial aircraft since the first revelations made four months ago. Airbus said in a July 27 statement that a process for re-establishing export credit “has been agreed and is ongoing.” Until the financing is restored, Airbus and rival Boeing Co. face the challenge of navigating an uncertain market with limited government assistance. Chicago-based Boeing has been unable to tap trade financing because a congressional impasse has left the U.S. Export-Import bank with too few directors to approve deals. Jefferies Equity Research estimates that export-credit agencies last year provided seven per cent of financing for Airbus plane deliveries, compared with 45 per cent from leasing companies and 40 per cent from airlines themselves.

The Mehr News agency quoted Fakhrieh Kashan on Sunday as saying that the deal was likely to be finalised when a Japanese delegation visits Tehran in December. The aircraft will be acquired through a lease-purchase contract and will be used by Aseman Airlines on domestic routes, Fakhrieh Khashan said. The lifting of long-standing economic sanctions against Iran in exchange for curbs on its nuclear activities has allowed it to strike provisional deals worth around $50 billion with Boeing and Airbus to buy some 200 airliners to renew its ageing fleet. However, financial and political obstacles have continued to dog the deals, and Iran has made clear it is widening its search to include other suppliers.

(Photo by Michael Marsland for Yale) St. Louis attorney Jerry Schlichter, who has won more than $150 million from several large companies accused of overcharging employees for their retirement plans, is targeting three universities in his latest lawsuits. Schlichter's firm, Schlichter Bogard & Denton, filed lawsuits Tuesday on behalf of employees at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, New York University and Yale University. All three complaints allege that employees were forced to pay millions of dollars in unreasonable and excessive fees. MIT offers a 401(k) defined-contribution plan for its employees, while NYU and Yale have similar 403(b) plans, which are for non-profit employers.  The lawsuit against MIT alleges that the university chose Fidelity Investments as its plan recordkeeper without a competitive bidding process. It also says that MIT placed more than 150 Fidelity funds in its 401(k), including high-priced retail funds for which cheaper alternatives were available. "The universities do not have high priced retail mutual funds in their multibillion-dollar endowments, yet they have them in their employees’ retirement plans, resulting in the employees paying excessive fees and diminishing their retirement savings,” Schlichter said in a statement. The suit also points out that Fidelity CEO Abigail Johnson is an MIT trustee and that Fidelity has donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to the university.

Check our People in Business The suits against NYU and Yale allege that the 403(b) plans paid excessive recordkeeping fees because they split their assets between multiple firms. They also say the universities imprudently kept funds in the plans even after they had underperformed for years. Schlichter's firm has filed 20 excessive-fee suits since 2006 and reached settlements in nine of them. Last December, it won a $57 million settlement in a suit over Boeing's 401(k) plan. Previous settlements include $62 million from Lockheed Martin, $30 million from International Paper, $27.5 million from Ameriprise and $16.5 million from Caterpillar. In May 2015, Schlichter won a U.S. Supreme Court case involving Edison International's 401(k) plan.
