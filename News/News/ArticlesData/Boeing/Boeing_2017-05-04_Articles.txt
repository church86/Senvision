The C919, built by state-owned aerospace manufacturer Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC), was set to take wing over Shanghai on Friday, the company said on Wednesday, according to the official Xinhua news agency. “If weather conditions are not suitable, the maiden flight will be rescheduled,” COMAC said, adding that engineers had completed some 118 tests. The narrow-body jet represents nearly a decade of effort in a state-mandated drive to reduce dependence on European consortium Airbus and US aerospace giant Boeing. “The first flight itself is not a huge deal. (But) of course, it’s going to be a hugely symbolic moment in the evolution of China’s aviation industry,” said Greg Waldron, Asia Managing Editor at industry publication Flightglobal. The C919 is the country’s first big passenger plane and the latest sign of growing Chinese ambition and technical skill, coming one week after China launched its first domestically made aircraft carrier and docked a cargo spacecraft with an orbiting space lab. The C919 can seat 168 passengers and has a range of 5,555 kilometres. China is a huge battleground for Boeing and Airbus, with its travellers taking to the skies in ever-growing numbers. The Chinese travel market is expected to surpass the United States by 2024, according to the International Air Transport Association. Airbus has estimated Chinese airlines will need nearly 6,000 new planes over the next two decades, while Boeing foresees 6,800 aircraft. Both put the combined price tags for those planes at around $1 trillion. But aviation analysts said Shanghai-based COMAC has a long journey ahead before it can challenge the lock on the market by Boeing and Airbus. “This is an important milestone for China with this new aircraft. But for it to move to the next stage, which is to sell this product, is not going to be so easy,” said Shukor Yusof, an analyst with Malaysia-based aviation consultancy Endau Analytics. But COMAC may be able to rely on purchases by fast-growing Chinese airlines. It had already received 570 orders by the end of last year, almost all from domestic airlines. — AFP About the author View all articles by Oman Observer ← Shell profits surge on rebounding oil Apple starting US tech manufacturing fund with $1 billion → ← Previous Next → Search Recent Posts Recent HM condoles with Saudi Arabian king Ready for take off UN hails, Syria rebels reject Shura concludes discussion with Minister Sajwani Read More ...

The maiden flight of the C919 is scheduled for May 5. The flight will depart from Shanghai Pudong International Airport. "If weather conditions are not suitable, the maiden flight will be rescheduled," COMAC said. (Xinhua/Ding Ting) BEIJING, May 4 -- While the much-awaited first Chinese-built passenger jet C919 is ready to make its maiden flight Friday, it may take much longer for the newcomer to take off in the aviation market. Shaking the dominance of aviation giants Boeing and Airbus in the near future is unrealistic, observers say, but the Chinese jetliner could be a strong option for global carriers in decades to come. Scheduled to depart from Shanghai Pudong International Airport on May 5, the C919, with 158 seats and a standard range of 4,075 kilometers, is expected to compete with the updated Airbus 320 and Boeing's new generation 737. A total of 23 foreign and domestic customers, including China's national carrier Air China and leasing company GE Capital Aviation Service, have placed orders for 570 aircraft, according to the Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC). But this is only the very first step. Even in China's domestic market, COMAC has a long way to go to turn technical success into business success. Currently, Chinese airlines seem to be more keen to spend money on wide-body aircraft to enhance their global routes with rising enthusiasm for overseas travel. Those jets are still the exclusive province of Boeing and Airbus. China Eastern Airlines signed contracts in 2016 to buy 20 A350-900 aircraft from Airbus and 15 B787-9 aircraft from Boeing to be delivered between 2018 and 2022. China Southern Airlines announced in April that it will buy 20 A350-900 with a total catalog price of nearly 6 billion U.S. dollars. Boeing and Airbus are very mature aircraft manufacturers, and COMAC should seek further cooperation with them to learn from their experiences, according to aviation analysts. But looking ahead, single-aisle planes like C919 will be the market mainstream and COMAC should do well in the Chinese market, one of the most competitive. Boeing predicted last year that China will become the world's top aviation market within 20 years, projecting a demand for 6,810 new aircraft in the next two decades with a total value of 1 trillion U.S. dollars. China will need 5,110 new single-aisle airplanes through 2035, accounting for 75 percent of the total new deliveries, according to Boeing. The C919 will be a strong competitor in this field being economical and comfortable, according to a research note from Guosen Securities. If the maiden flight is successful, COMAC will seek airworthiness certificates from the Civil Aviation Administration of China and foreign aviation safety regulators before making its first deliveries. Also, to pave way for C919 to enter foreign markets, the airworthiness certification of the jet will be a part of bilateral air safety agreement talks between China and the EU. China has invested heavily in commercial passenger jet manufacturing. In 2007, plans to develop a domestic large passenger jet were approved by the State Council. In November 2015, the first C919 jet rolled off the assembly line. The ARJ21, the country's first regional aircraft also produced by COMAC, began commercial operations in June 2016 following its maiden flight in 2008.

United Airlines on Wednesday inaugurated a three-times-weekly nonstop service from the U.S. West Coast city San Francisco to the southeast Chinese city of Hangzhou. (Xinhua/Huang Zongzhi) WASHINGTON, May 4 (Xinhua) -- U.S. experts said Thursday China's new passenger planes pose no immediate threat to Western aviation companies such as Boeing and Airbus. The maiden flight of China's C919 passenger plane, scheduled for Friday from Shanghai Pudong International Airport, represents one step towards the country's bid to reduce reliance on foreign airliners. "The Chinese government is interested in establishing independence and self-sufficiency in all aspects of aviation," Douglas Royce, an aerospace expert at Forecast International, an aerospace market research firm, told Xinhua. It is engaged in a long-term process of catching up to Europe, the United States, and Russia in commercial aircraft, he said, adding this is one step in that direction. The 158-seat C919 is China's first large passenger jet and is expected to compete with the updated Airbus 320 and Boeing's new generation 737. So far, 23 foreign and domestic customers, including China's national carrier Air China and leasing company GE Capital Aviation Service, have placed orders for 570 aircrafts, according to the Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC), the manufacturer of the C919. Royce predicted that demand for the C919 will be centered in the Chinese market and a few satellite markets in the early years of service. "Airbus and Boeing have spent decades competing fiercely against each other and are lean and mean in the airliner market. The duopoly in the airliner sector has resulted in very well-made products," he explained. "What COMAC faces here is not two bloated, non-competitive players. Both companies are at the top of their game," Royce said. "So it will be very difficult for COMAC to break into western markets, particularly when very few airlines have experience with using COMAC's aircraft in service." In contrast, the A320 and 737 have huge advantages because the airlines already have built up a lot of knowledge and infrastructure around flying both types. Richard Aboulafia, vice president at Teal Group Corp., a U.S.-based aeronautics analysis firm, held a similar view. While building and flying a plane is an important step and an expensive one, the next steps such as customer support, finance, and the ability to offer aggressive discounts are "just as important, and just as expensive," he told Xinhua. Even if the C919 ends up being a superior aircraft, it will still take years for many Western airlines to consider adding the type to their fleets, Royce noted. But he added that the C919 might be able to get orders from startup airlines that aren't already flying either of the Western models. In addition, traditional customers of Russian passenger aircraft will also make viable sales targets. To pave the way for the jet to enter foreign market, China has already been in talks with the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) and the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to obtain the airworthiness certification for the C919. "Getting FAA and EASA certification would be a huge win for the program," Royce said. "The aircraft requires Western certification to compete directly with Airbus and Boeing in major markets. On a symbolic level, it also shows huge progress for China's civil aircraft industry." However, he cautioned that certification is "a long and expensive process" for aircraft manufacturers in the U.S. and that for a newcomer like COMAC, dealing with the FAA is "a new world for them." Aboulafia said while certification is necessary, it "has no impact on commercial competitiveness." Meanwhile, COMAC estimated that it can sell 2,000 C919s over the next 20 years, but Royce said it's "way too optimistic." "An estimate of 600-800 C919s over 20 years once production starts is a more reasonable goal given the very strong competition offered by Boeing and Airbus, coupled with Chinese-made airliners' lack of a long-term operating and maintenance history," he said. "A COMAC-built airliner has no track record in either area, and it will take a long time for the aircraft manufacturer to establish itself as the equal of Airbus and Boeing in the area of global sales and product support." However, over the very long term, Royce said, COMAC is likely to become "a major player in the airline segment." "It's not something that will happen over the next decade, but rather a long-term process that will require ongoing support from the Chinese government," he said. When asked to comment on the C919, a spokesman for Boeing told Xinhua: "We would like to take this opportunity to congratulate COMAC for the successful development of the C919 airplane."

BEIJING: China’s home-grown C919 passenger jet is set to take to the skies on its long-delayed maiden flight on Friday, a major step for Beijing as it looks to boost its profile in the global aviation market. The narrow-body aircraft, which will compete with Boeing’s 737 and the Airbus A320, is a key symbol of China’s ambitions to muscle into a global jet market estimated to be worth US$2 trillion over the next 20 years. The jet will take to the skies at the Shanghai Pudong International Airport on China’s affluent east coast, at a ceremony expected to be broadcast live on state TV. The C919, made by state-owned Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC), has seen its test flight pushed back at least twice since 2014 due to production issues, underlining the scale of the task facing Beijing. “The significance is huge, it’s the first ever large-frame aircraft made in China,” said Xiong Yuexi, a professor and plane design expert at Beihang University in Beijing. “It has a great impact for the Chinese people and the domestic market.” China first gave the world a glimpse of the plane, which will be able to carry 158-168 passengers, in November 2015 when it rolled it out at a ceremony in Shanghai. Analysts, however, say the production delays mean the C919 will lag technologically behind improved versions of the A320 and 737 which will enter service in the next two years. China Eastern Airlines is the launch customer for the plane, which COMAC says has 570 orders from 23 customers. The plane also relies on an array of overseas technology, with CFM International, a joint venture between General Electric’s aerospace arm and a unit of French firm Safran, supplying the engines. Others include Honeywell International Inc, United Technologies Corp subsidiary Goodrich, Rockwell Collins Inc and a unit of Parker-Hannifin Corp. Conceived in 2008, China wants the C919 to eventually take market share from Boeing and Airbus in the lucrative narrow-body market which accounts for more than 50 percent of the aircraft in service worldwide. However, the jet likely faces a lengthy journey from first flight to commercial usage. China’s first home-made jet, the regional ARJ-21, received its type certification in December 2014, six years after its first flight and more than 12 years after it was conceived. It made its maiden passenger flight in June last year. Then there is also the daunting task of selling the jet in a global market dominated by Boeing and Airbus. “Aviation is a complex market and you need experience over a long time. Boeing has 100 years, Airbus has over 40 years,” said Sinolink Securities analyst Si Jingzhe, adding COMAC still lagged far behind in terms of supply chain know-how. China is pushing for recognition globally of its certification by European and US regulators. Without their certification, China would only be able to sell the jet to a handful of countries that accept its certification standards. Beijing is also already looking beyond the C919, with plans to develop a wide-body long-haul jet with Russia. In November COMAC and its partner United Aircraft Corp said they have started the hunt to find suppliers. Comments Readers are required to have a valid Facebook account to comment on this story.

Delivery of the first of the new aircraft is due to begin in June. Meantime, FAA and European inspectors were flying the simulator as part of the certification process. CAROL ROSENBERG crosenberg@miamiherald.com Business May 04, 2017 4:02 PM What’s it like to fly Boeing’s new jetliner? Pilots will soon find out in Miami simulator By Carol Rosenberg crosenberg@miamiherald.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story When U.S. pilots start flying into Miami soon for training on Boeing’s new jetliner, they’ll get a full-body experience. A 737 MAX simulator shown to media and airline representatives on Thursday offers an opportunity to sit in an exact replica of a cockpit of the new aircraft — to be delivered to the first airline customers in June — for training before delivery. From the cockpit, trainees see video reproductions that let them practice taking off, landing and flying, and experience the tilt, turbulence and climb of an actual aircraft. On Thursday, Miami’s Boeing Campus training site gave airline representatives and reporters a look at its new simulation suites and full-flight simulator, a pod-like unit containing the cockpit. It is Boeing’s only U.S. site where pilots can train on the new aircraft. Delivery to airlines begins in June. The media day visit also showed the 16-student classroom where mechanics are training specifically on the new aircraft, distinguishable from other 737s by its split-tipped winglet. Seattle-based Jayson Remfert, Boeing’s maintenance training product manager, said the program teaches already seasoned airline mechanics how to maintain and monitor a 737 MAX, even before they get hands-on experience with the real thing. Miami is the first campus to offer “MAX training” for the plane, also called the 737-8, said Martin Schaaf, campus manager. Boeing will later set up simulation classes in Singapore, Gatwick and Shanghai to train pilots for the 3,700-plus MAX aircraft already ordered by 87 airlines around the world. Miami is the first to have the 737 MAX classroom, Schaaf said, because “it’s a great aviation community” with proximity to “many of our customers.” More than a dozen airlines have already signed up to do their 737 MAX training in Miami, Schaaf said, including Aer Lingus, Air Mexico, American, Air Canada, Alaska Airlines, COPA and Southwest. Some of them also toured the training sites on Thursday. The MAX version caused a mini-stir earlier this week when CNN disclosed American Airlines’ plan to shrink the legroom in economy class in the new model. Simulation has come a long way since pilots underwent rote memorization and learning from manuals with classroom lectures, said Seattle-based Scott Anderson of the 737 MAX training development team, as he demonstrated Miami’s simulation suite capable of teaching four pilots at a time. Today, they learn with hands-on training. Rather than sit at a desk, the pilots sit side by side at a flat-panel, interactive flight deck computerized cockpit before graduating to a full-flight simulators. Today’s generation “don’t want to read about it. They want to do it,” Anderson said. “The students of the future, they’re not afraid of technology.” Old school overlaps with new school at a 737 MAX simulation training room at Boeing’s Miami Campus, where the aircraft manufacturer unveiled its training suites for the new 737 due to begin service in June with delivery of the first of 3,700 aircraft to some 87 airlines. CAROL ROSENBERG crosenberg@miamiherald.com Thursday, the campus team showed the 737 MAX full cockpit simulator. Its computerized program was frozen in flight over foggy Washington state during a break in checks by inspectors from the FAA and European aviation agencies. Boeing has about 1,600 employees in Florida, with 100 of those at the Miami training center. Others are at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center and Cape Canaveral Air Force Station and in Jacksonville, where the firm supports Navy P-8 training.

At least 15 foreign partners such as General Electric Co., Safran SA and Honeywell International Inc. worked on components and systems of the C919. Comac Advertisement Out of more than 1,000 flights scheduled to take off or land at Shanghai’s vast Pudong International Airport on May 5, one marks the beginning of a new era in the aviation business. China is making its boldest attempt yet to break the stranglehold that Airbus SE and Boeing Co. have on the market for big commercial airliners. After years of delays, the nation’s first modern large jet is expected to make its maiden flight. “The C919 will be a game-changer for China’s aerospace industry,” said Corrine Png, CEO of Singapore-based research firm Crucial Perspective. The 158-174 seat C919 is made by state-owned Commercial Aircraft Corp. of China Ltd. and follows Comac’s development of a smaller, regional jet, the ARJ21, that was flown by a Chinese airline for the first time last year. The C919 brings Comac to the table in one of the most lucrative sectors of commercial aviation, competing head-to-head with Boeing’s ubiquitous 737 and Airbus’s A320. The C919’s first flight is set for about 2:00 p.m. local time in Shanghai, Xinmin reported, citing the control center handling the event. Flights at Pudong between 1:00 p.m. and 3:30 p.m. may be delayed due to the new jetliner’s maiden trip. Popular Now How to Reduce Costs through Supply Chain Network Optimization Supply Chain Basics: Utilizing the Planning Process to Optimize Business Performance Steps Industry Can Take to Reduce Energy Consumption Behind the celebrations of a Made-in-China jet is the reality that Comac was able to build its new plane using a string of Western suppliers. At least 15 foreign partners such as General Electric Co., Safran SA and Honeywell International Inc. worked on components and systems of the C919. “Comac has really leaned on the experience of its suppliers,” said Tom Szlosek, chief financial officer at Honeywell. “We’re adding a lot of value.” Tapping into the supply chains of Airbus and Boeing allows Comac to bypass many of the technical challenges of making a modern commercial jet from scratch and builds up the company’s expertise for future designs. “It’s impractical for Comac not to take advantage of technologies that are already out there,” said Yu Zhanfu, a principal at Roland Berger Strategy Consultants in Beijing. “If you insist on doing everything from the ground up by yourself, chances are you will become irrelevant.” Companies based outside China supply C919 systems for flight control, power, lighting, cockpit control and much else. The engines and landing gear are from overseas manufacturers. Global Supply Chain The Chinese jet demonstrates the extent globalization has taken over the manufacture of major engineering products. Just as the jet relies on systems from firms based around the world, many of those systems are built with components that originated in China. The C919’s engines for example are made by CFM. CFM’s parents, GE and French manufacturer Safran Aircraft Engines, in turn buy more than $500 million of Chinese-made parts a year for the company’s single-aisle jet engine series, the company said. A China-designed aircraft doesn’t mean all the parts have to be made by the Chinese, said Bao Pengli, a project manager for the C919 at Comac. Some of the equipment are sourced from international suppliers to meet Comac’s standards and they not only supply Comac, but also other airplane makers around the world, he said. China’s approach is almost the opposite of the strategy followed by Japan when it was at a similar level of development. There, Japan’s aerospace companies became suppliers to Boeing, and more recently Airbus, and now make as much as 35% of the Boeing 787’s airframe, according to Boeing Japan. China’s decision to build its own large jet with overseas help is one reason the C919’s specifications are similar to the 737 Max and A320, said Michel Merluzeau, director of aerospace and defense market analysis for AirInsightResearch in Seattle. It should also help Comac ensure the plane is a success. Of 15 non-Chinese suppliers contacted by Bloomberg about their involvement with the C919, eight -- FACC AG, Honeywell, Parker Aerospace, UTC Aerospace Systems, Arconic, Liebherr-Aerospace, Eaton and CFM International -- responded. All expressed confidence in the new aircraft and the potential for further collaboration in China. While the emergence of a Chinese jet brings new revenue for component suppliers, it turns up the heat on the world’s two biggest planemakers in a key market for growth. Boeing predicted in September that China will need over 6,800 aircraft valued at more than $1 trillion in the two decades through 2035, and three-fourths of them will be single-aisle planes. The country’s largest carrier, China Southern Airlines Co., and its units have ordered more than $15 billion of new aircraft from Airbus and Boeing since 2015. Workforce Concern Boeing, which plans to build a facility in China, said it congratulated Comac on the development of the C919. Airbus already assembles A320s at a plant in Tianjin and said the competition would be good for the industry. U.S. labor unions aren’t so sure. “We have been sending out the alarm bells for many years now about China’s growing aerospace industry,” said Owen Herrnstadt, director of trade and globalization for the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers. “They’ve pitted Western aerospace companies against one another.” Fabrice Bregier, who runs Airbus’s jetliner arm, said at an airshow last year he expects the Chinese to become serious competitors but it would be well into the next decade before they had the range of aircraft and support network to be a global player. “The real challenge for the Chinese is not to design and operate and fly an aircraft” in the C919 category, said AirInsight’s Merluzeau. “The real challenge is how they are going to be able to demonstrate to the customer outside of China that they can support and service the aircraft.” Within China, though, Comac will benefit from strong government support, according to George Ferguson, a Bloomberg Intelligence analyst who estimates the country has committed as much as $7 billion to the program. “At some point, the government is going to say to the airlines: ’You need to buy these airplanes.”’ That support is one reason China’s attempt to build big jets is faring better than efforts in Japan and Brazil, according to a March report by RAND Corp. The report said China was “absorbing losses that would dissuade new market entrants operating on a purely private-enterprise basis.” Few doubt China’s determination to build its expertise. Comac is already working with Russia’s United Aircraft Corp. to develop a bigger, twin-aisle airliner, dubbed the C929, that would compete with the 787 and A330 models. “They’re serious about learning how to produce parts -- and producing high quality aircraft parts,” said Jeegar Kakkad, chief economist and director of policy for ADS Group, the London-based trade association representing aerospace companies in the U.K. “There is a huge learning curve for them.” Print reprints Favorite EMAIL Tweet Please Log In or Register to post comments.

By Ana Maria Archila, Javier H. Valdés / AlterNet May 4, 2017 Print Comments Photo Credit: Eric Crama / Shutterstock Donald Trump has made it clear that he intends to govern exactly as promised in his campaign, unrolling a series of harmful policies designed to hurt immigrants, workers, and their families. Yet the government cannot implement this hateful agenda on its own. On immigration, for instance, it will need the help of private prison and immigrant detention companies who can house the vast numbers of immigrants already being rounded up for deportation, Wall Street firms who can provide the funding for them, software companies that make billions in government contracts from the agencies deporting immigrants and militarizing the border, and manufacturers who can build a border wall. These companies - household names like JP Morgan Chase, Wells Fargo, and Boeing - stand to gain enormously from Trump’s plans.  Executives of many of these companies sit on Trump’s Business Council or advise the President. And while they all seek to cultivate a reputation as civic leaders, few have publicly denounced Trump’s anti-immigrant agenda or his plans to roll back worker protections, while they have all proved willing to position themselves to gain from Trump’s policies. Unlike Trump’s headline-grabbing Executive Orders, these companies’ ties with the White House have gone under the radar. That needs to change. It is time to name these corporations and reveal once and for all their complicity in Trump’s agenda. That is why we are launching a campaign to let the American people target these companies and encourage elected officials to divest taxpayer funds from them. The Center for Popular Democracy and Make The Road New York have launched a campaign to draw attention to nine companies - Goldman Sachs, Blackstone, JP Morgan Chase, Wells Fargo, Blackrock, Boeing, IBM, Uber, and Disney. This “Corporate Backers of Hate” campaign calls on companies to disassociate themselves from the Trump administration and end corporate practices that benefit from his agenda. We are not the first to cast suspicion on these companies’ misdeeds. Portland, Oregon, recently decided to divest from all corporations altogether, barring all investments in corporate debt and shifting city money to other types of investments like U.S. Treasury bonds. Elected officials in states like New York are exploring similar approaches. Our campaign will encourage other states and cities to follow this lead and stop investing in, or doing business with, in companies that put immigrant communities and workers at risk. They include JP Morgan Chase and Wells Fargo, which both finance the debt of the two largest private prison companies in the country, CoreCivic and GeoGroup. Wells Fargo owns more than $30 million worth of shares in these companies. That is more than double the value of their investments on Election Day, given that share prices of these companies have soared since Trump’s victory. The list continues. Goldman Sachs is the 9th largest shareholder in CoreCivic and the 33rd largest in GeoGroup. Blackrock has shares in both companies worth more than $700 million. The Boeing Company, meanwhile, may become a critical player in constructing any kind of border wall. Since 2008, the company has received more than $1 billion in contracts from U.S. Customs and Border Protection to support the agency’s work policing the US-Mexico border. In 2005, they received a $67 million multi-year contract to help build a 2,000 mile “virtual border fence” along the border – a project eventually scrapped after significant delays and overspending. Boeing’s CEO has refused to rule out working with the administration on their latest misguided attempt to build a wall. Finally, Trump’s immigration policies will benefit companies who have a stake in data management, particularly IBM, which has received $1.7 billion from Immigration and Customs Enforcement and CBP since 2008. The head of IBM serves on the Business Council and advises Trump’s new Office of American Innovation. When more than 100 technology companies signed a legal brief opposing Trump’s Muslim ban, IBM did not join. And though thousands of IBM employees have publicly opposed the company’s ties with the Trump administration, their CEO has refused to step off the Business Council. These are just a few of the companies that could benefit from the pain of immigrant communities and the separation of families. In the pursuit of financial gain, actual lives could be on the line. The unleashing of ICE has already hurt scores of immigrants -- since Trump’s inauguration alone, more than 21,000 immigrants have been detained and possibly separated from their families – and the corporations standing by Trump are directly implicated in their suffering. Given the stakes, it is clear that “business as usual” is no longer an option. These corporations have exercised their sway over our democracy for far too long. It is time to take a stand and make clear that our communities will not be exploited for corporate profits. We will not stay silent any longer.   Ana Maria Archila is Co-Executive Director of the Center for Popular Democracy (@popdemoc). Javier H.

Boeing delivered 51 commercial aircraft* to 23 airlines, six lessors and three unidentified customers during the month. Year-to-date, the US-based manufacturer has delivered 213 commercial aircraft. Ryanair led Boeing’s April tally as the Irish low-cost carrier (LCC) took delivery of seven new 737-800s. China Eastern Airlines received three new aircraft during the month (two 737-800s and a 777-300ER) and two aircraft each were delivered to American Airlines (a 737-800 and a 787-8), Singapore-based lessor BOC Aviation (a 737-800 and a 777-300ER), China Southern Airlines (both 737-800s), Atlanta-based Delta Air Lines (both 737-900ERs), US-based lessor GECAS (both 737-800s), UK leisure airline Jet2.com (both 737-800s), Korean Air (a 747-8 and a 787-9), Norwegian (both 737-800s), Russian lessor Sberbank Leasing (both 737-800s), Turkish carrier SunExpress Airlines (both 737-800s) and Air France subsidiary Transavia (both 737-800s). Additional 787 deliveries in April included a 787-8 to Singapore-based medium-haul LCC Scoot and one 787-9 each to Aeromexico, Air France-KLM Group, Japan’s All Nippon Airways, US-based lessor CIT Aerospace, Saudi Arabian Airlines and China’s Xiamen Airlines. Boeing’s April firm orders included eight 737 MAXs (variant unspecified) from an unidentified customer, another three 737 MAXs (variant unspecified) from a separate unidentified customer, two 787-9s from a third unidentified customer (valued at $529.2 million) and one 737-800 for SMBC Aviation Capital, bringing the Dublin-based lessor’s year-to-date total of 737-800s orders to three, a $288 million investment. Year-to-date, Boeing’s gross commercial aircraft order total stands at 187 aircraft, valued at $24 billion.

Shaking the dominance of aviation giants Boeing and Airbus in the near future is unrealistic, observers say, but the Chinese jetliner could be a strong option for global carriers in decades to come. Scheduled to depart from Shanghai Pudong International Airport on May 5, the C919, with 158 seats and a standard range of 4,075 kilometers, is expected to compete with the updated Airbus 320 and Boeing's new generation 737. A total of 23 foreign and domestic customers, including China's national carrier Air China and leasing company GE Capital Aviation Service, have placed orders for 570 aircraft, according to the Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC). But this is only the very first step. Even in China's domestic market, COMAC has a long way to go to turn technical success into business success. Currently, Chinese airlines seem to be more keen to spend money on wide-body aircraft to enhance their global routes with rising enthusiasm for overseas travel. Those jets are still the exclusive province of Boeing and Airbus. China Eastern Airlines signed contracts in 2016 to buy 20 A350-900 aircraft from Airbus and 15 B787-9 aircraft from Boeing to be delivered between 2018 and 2022. China Southern Airlines announced in April that it will buy 20 A350-900 with a total catalog price of nearly 6 billion U.S. dollars. Boeing and Airbus are very mature aircraft manufacturers, and COMAC should seek further cooperation with them to learn from their experiences, according to aviation analysts. But looking ahead, single-aisle planes like C919 will be the market mainstream and COMAC should do well in the Chinese market, one of the most competitive. Boeing predicted last year that China will become the world's top aviation market within 20 years, projecting a demand for 6,810 new aircraft in the next two decades with a total value of 1 trillion U.S. dollars. China will need 5,110 new single-aisle airplanes through 2035, accounting for 75 percent of the total new deliveries, according to Boeing. The C919 will be a strong competitor in this field being economical and comfortable, according to a research note from Guosen Securities. If the maiden flight is successful, COMAC will seek airworthiness certificates from the Civil Aviation Administration of China and foreign aviation safety regulators before making its first deliveries. Also, to pave way for C919 to enter foreign markets, the airworthiness certification of the jet will be a part of bilateral air safety agreement talks between China and the EU. China has invested heavily in commercial passenger jet manufacturing. In 2007, plans to develop a domestic large passenger jet were approved by the State Council. In November 2015, the first C919 jet rolled off the assembly line. The ARJ21, the country's first regional aircraft also produced by COMAC, began commercial operations in June 2016 following its maiden flight in 2008.

KC-46 aircraft to tanker test programme Boeing has added a sixth KC-46 Pegasus military aerial refuelling aircraft to its tanker test programme, a move that expands the company's ability to complete ground and flight-test activities. The addition comes ahead of the first deliveries to the US Air Force (USAF). The latest KC-46 aircraft has undergone test activities to ensure its ability to operate safely through electromagnetic fields produced by radars, radio towers and other systems, Boeing stated. The KC-46A tanker test team director Jeanette Croppi said: “Adding another tanker will help us to become even more efficient and significantly improve our ability to complete test points going forward. “We are also reconfiguring one of our 767-2C aircraft into a tanker, which means we will soon have four KC-46s in test.” The newest KC-46 aerial refuelling aircraft conducted its maiden flight on 29 April and is said to be the second low-rate initial production tanker. "Adding this aircraft brings key capabilities to the test fleet and helps move us closer to delivering operational aircraft to the warfighter." USAF KC-46 programme manager colonel John Newberry said: “This first flight is another important step towards verifying the aircraft’s operational capabilities. "Adding this aircraft brings key capabilities to the test fleet and helps move us closer to delivering operational aircraft to the warfighter." The test aircraft recorded 1,600 flight hours and more than 1,200 'contacts' during refuelling flights with F-16, F/A-18, AV-8B, C-17, A-10, and KC-10 aircraft. The KC-46A multirole tanker is capable of refuelling all allied and coalition military aircraft that are compatible with international procedures and can carry passengers, cargo and patients.

IranAir's plan to buy more than 180 jets from Airbus [AIR.PA] and Boeing (BA.N) is the most visible economic deal on the table after major powers last year lifted most sanctions on Iran in return for restrictions on its nuclear activities. But financing for the purchases has been hard to secure because most Western banks are holding back, concerned about the future of the 2015 agreement after U.S. President Donald Trump called it a bad deal and ordered a review. So far, IranAir has taken delivery of just three Airbus jets, for which it paid cash, industry sources say. Deputy Roads and Urban Development Minister Asghar Fakhrieh-Kashan said the UK's export credit arm, UK Export Finance (UKEF), had tentatively offered support for least some Airbus jets built in Britain, France, Germany and Spain. It could also offer some support to Airbus's U.S. rival, Boeing, he added. "We have received some offers from UKEF, that is under review by Iran," Fakhrieh-Kashan told Reuters. Two aircraft industry sources who asked not to be named also confirmed talks were taking place. UKEF and both major planemakers declined to comment. Countries in parts of the world where banks don't invest often turn to European and U.S. governments for export credits or loan insurance when they want to buy big-ticket items like aircraft from those countries' companies. About 6 percent of aircraft deliveries depend on such support, which removes some but not all of the risks that banks face in lending to airlines with poor credit, helping to grease the wheels of trade. Iran, UK elections  Speeding up aircraft deliveries is seen as a priority for Tehran as President Hassan Rouhani's government seeks to show results from the sanctions deal ahead of elections on May 19. Iran says the prospect of buying Western jets to renew its decaying fleet was built into the 2015 nuclear deal and that any barriers to completing the purchases would undermine the accord. On the UK side, Prime Minister Theresa May's recent decision to hold a snap election in early June means any new funding deal is unlikely to be finalized before then. UK government agencies like UKEF avoid major new initiatives during campaigning and a deal involving a topic as sensitive as trade with Iran would need approval before it could go ahead. Airbus said last week on an investors' call that it hoped to receive some support from European export financing agencies this year. But a source familiar with the process said it remained unclear how quickly UKEF would lift a temporary ban on Airbus funding as the UK and French fraud investigation continues. If UKEF provides support for Boeing deliveries, it would not be the first time, but it would be rare. The main proviso is that a certain proportion of parts in each jet need to be made in Britain - usually 20 percent. For Boeing exports, that would typically mean the jets would have to have Rolls-Royce (RR.L) engines. The Boeing planes ordered by Iran all have engines made by U.S. supplier General Electric (GE.N) or GE and its French partner Safran (SAF.PA). UKEF has said in the past it recognizes the need to be flexible on foreign content in view of global supply chains. People who have dealt with the agency before say it may be able to consider equipment bought by Boeing from British companies. Iran has several private and public airline companies in operation, among which IranAir is the oldest one. The number of operational airports in the country is 46. Since sanctions imposed on the Islamic Republic were lifted last year, Iran began to take steps to upgrade its air industry, revamp an aging airline fleet, equipment and airports. On April 4, Iran signed an agreement with Boeing for buying dozens of the company’s twinjet narrow-body passenger planes. The agreement involves the purchase of 30 Boeing 737 MAX planes as well as the purchase rights for an additional 30 planes of the same class. It was signed between Iran’s Aseman Airlines and Boeing in Tehran. Boeing is to provide 50 planes of the same type to Iran Air through a similar agreement. The overall value of Iran Air’s order that also involves 30 long-range wide-body 777 aircraft is estimated to be $16.6 billion. During a January 2016 visit to Paris by Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, Tehran also signed a major contract with Airbus worth about $27 billion to buy 118 planes. --- Kamila Aliyeva is AzerNews’ staff journalist, follow her on Twitter: @Kami_Aliyeva Follow us on Twitter @AzerNewsAz      Category News London police detain man at Heathrow on suspicion of planning terror attack 10:05 Russia, Iran ,Turkey agree on de-escalation zones in Syria 4 May 16:27 Ankara, Moscow relations back to normal 4 May 15:21 7 Turkish servicemen injured in shootout 4 May 13:33 Uzbekistan adopts program to develop hydropower engineering 4 May 13:32 Iran attempted missile launch from submarine 4 May 11:47 Fitch affirms three Kazakh policy institutions 4 May 10:14 Iranian ex-president supports Rouhani 3 May 18:07 Sochi hosts Erdogan-Putin talks 3 May 16:12 Rouhani rivals mass-purchase social channels in presidential campaign 3 May 16:08 Latest Popular 11:00 • President Aliyev talks transformation of World Forum on Intercultural Dialogue 11:00 • Journey from the Caspian reaches Garadagh [PHOTO] 10:58 • Armenian troops keep high tension on frontline 10:42 • Top official: PACE position on Turkey completely unfair 10:40 • President Aliyev, First Lady attending 4th World Forum on Intercultural Dialogue [UPDATE] 10:36 • UN: Azerbaijan contributing to development of intercultural dialogue 10:34 • Galib Israfilov: Closing of OSCE Yerevan office - result of Armenia's attempt to consolidate occupation of Azerbaijani lands 10:34 • AZERNEWS releases another print issue 10:24 • FIG Sec-Gen notes Azerbaijan’s incredible progress in gymnastics 10:20 • EBRD pushes on with Azerbaijan gas loan 10:17 • Minister: Baku intercultural forum becoming more authoritative 10:10 • Top oficcial: Armenian leadership unaware of being on wrong path 10:05 • London police detain man at Heathrow on suspicion of planning terror attack 10:03 • Currency rates for May 5 10:00 • Where US manufacturing jobs really went 09:57 • Azerbaijani boxers to compete in Kazakhstan 09:37 • Rainless weather to prevail in Baku 4 May 18:34 • Eurosport: 5 reasons to follow Tour of Azerbaijan [PHOTO] 4 May 18:14 • Armenians fire at Red Cross staff, villagers in Aghdam 4 May 18:12 • London to host Azerbaijani–UK poetry night 4 May 17:51 • SOCAR OKs Total's program to develop Azerbaijani gas field 4 May 14:06 • Baku to host 7th Caspian Int’l Power and Alternative Energy Exhibition 4 May 17:47 • Azerbaijan's tourism potential presented in Uzbekistan [PHOTO] 4 May 15:21 • Ankara, Moscow relations back to normal 4 May 11:21 • Azerbaijani, Indonesian businessmen eye cooperation opportunities [PHOTO] 4 May 17:14 • Azerbaijan, Djibouti to strengthen inter-parliamentary ties 4 May 17:22 • Iran in talks with UK over jetliner export funding 4 May 11:48 • President Aliyev receives chairman of US-based Foundation for Ethnic Understanding [PHOTO/UPDATE] 4 May 15:37 • Azerbaijan Fashion Week coming back! 4 May 13:32 • Uzbekistan adopts program to develop hydropower engineering 4 May 16:27 • Russia, Iran ,Turkey agree on de-escalation zones in Syria 4 May 18:07 • Sale of SIM cards to foreign nationals simplified 4 May 17:32 • 28 Azerbaijani Para-athletes to compete in Islamic Games [PHOTO] 4 May 12:18 • Heydar Aliyev - the first Azerbaijani general of the state security bodies [PHOTO] 4 May 17:57 • CBA announces manat rate for May 5 4 May 16:15 • Minister: Azerbaijan’s population rapidly increasing 4 May 16:00 • FUTURESHORTS – largest short film festival is back!

Three of our nominees are current Board members (none having served for more than 16 months), and two are entirely new nominees who have not yet served on Arconic’s Board. One commitment, though, binds them together: an unwavering dedication to shareholder interests. We recently made several attempts to settle the disruptive proxy contest started by Elliott Management (“Elliott”). Despite our best efforts, we were unsuccessful. Elliott agreed to end the fight on terms both sides indicated were acceptable. Then Elliott reneged. We resumed discussions and then Elliott agreed again, though on different terms. Elliott then reneged. Again. We tried, nevertheless, to end the battle by offering two Board seats to the candidates Elliott has nominated. Notably, and reflecting Elliott’s pervasive influence over its nominees, none of Elliott’s director candidates accepted our offer. An outstanding director slate, dedicated to serving your interests We have now recruited two exceptional new director nominees for the Board who are purely independent. They join our slate alongside three current Board members – our Interim CEO, the head of our Audit Committee and the head of our Cybersecurity Subcommittee. Together, these five nominees bring decades of experience in aerospace and defense. We hope you will join us in voting for them. Our new nominees are: James “Jim” F. Albaugh, an internationally recognized aerospace executive who was the President and Chief Executive Officer of Boeing Commercial Airplanes until his retirement in 2012. Prior to that role, Mr. Albaugh was President and CEO of Boeing Integrated Defense Systems and President of Rocketdyne Propulsion and Power. Mr. Albaugh is the Chairman of the National Aeronautic Association, past Chairman of the Aerospace Industries Association and serves on the Boards of American Airlines and Harris Corporation. He holds a Master’s degree in Civil Engineering from Columbia University and is an elected member of the National Academy of Engineering. The aerospace segment represents close to half of Arconic’s overall revenue today and has significant prospects for the future. Mr. Albaugh brings a deep understanding of the aerospace segment’s needs. Janet C. Wolfenbarger, a retired four-star general who was responsible for procurement, science and technology, test and evaluation, logistics and supply chain for the U.S. Air Force; she oversaw an approximately $60 billion annual budget, including a large portion of the approximately $1 billion of business that Arconic does in the defense industry. In her last military role, General Wolfenbarger oversaw an organization of 80,000 people and led significant restructuring of the Air Force Materiel Command to improve efficiency. General Wolfenbarger was the first female four-star general in Air Force history. Among her many accomplishments, General Wolfenbarger holds a Master’s degree in Aeronautics and Astronautics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Both of these new nominees know Arconic from having served as respected leaders at important Arconic customers. They bring operating experience and commercial insights that we believe will help optimize the Company and its strategy for many years. We are confident that these two nominees, like our other nominees, are independent and objective and seeking only to serve Arconic using their best judgment and insights from decades of relevant experience. The reality is that regardless of who wins this proxy fight, there will be change in the Board, and there will be new perspectives. Our slate of nominees has five new directors: two who have never served on our Board, two who have served for fewer than seven months and one who was originally nominated by Elliott and who joined the Board just last year. So, your choice at this meeting is not really about “change” or “no change.” The most important decision this Board will make in the coming months is the selection of a new CEO. Arconic’s recommended Board is without question best placed to select the next CEO, given its deep industry expertise and view of the marketplace. Your choice is about some important principles and some critical people. Strong governance over questionable tactics Elliott has had three primary goals during its campaign: Remove the sitting CEO and steer the selection of his replacement; Shape a majority of the Arconic Board; and Dictate the direction of key Board decisions and processes. Since Arconic’s CEO stepped down, Elliott has shifted its attacks to the Board level with increasingly personal attacks on directors and hyperbolic assertions that the Board is weak on governance. Elliott’s latest attack theme – “subversion of shareholder democracy” – is ironically being deployed in an effort to enable one 13.2% shareholder to shape a majority of the Board. If successful, Elliott will have nominated seven of Arconic’s 13 directors. A weak-governance Board would have ended this fight to spare itself Elliott’s unfair attacks. We could have agreed, via settlement, to Elliott’s over-reaching demands, including its insistence on appointing a majority of both an Operating Committee and the CEO Search Committee. But Arconic’s Board has refused to allow one shareholder these unilateral rights; instead we are focused on full shareholder representation and participation. For our part, we believe public companies should be run for all shareholders and should be governed ethically. We also believe that: In the public markets, no single minority investor should have the right to shape a majority of the Board, select a CEO, or unilaterally define how a Board organizes itself and operates; Hedge funds should not have free reign to level false or unsubstantiated accusations with the aim of embarrassing, ruining or damaging people. We believe that a vote on Elliott’s proxy card is a vote of encouragement for activists who demand undue influence as Elliott has clearly demanded at Arconic, and for activists to use tactics of personal destruction as their means. The right kind of change to keep Arconic on a strong path Your choice at the 2017 Annual Meeting is between two sets of directors – both essentially new to Arconic. Shareholders should ask themselves – which set is most qualified to be stewards of their investment and this Company? We believe that our nominees – including Mr. Albaugh and retired General Wolfenbarger – bring substantially more relevant expertise to the Board than those nominated by Elliott. We welcome your thoughtful evaluation of the two director slates. Our nominees also include: David Hess. Mr. Hess has more than 38 years of operational and leadership experience in aerospace and deep knowledge of jet engine technology and manufacturing. As our interim CEO, Mr. Hess has been a stabilizing force at Arconic during a time of leadership transition. We do not believe that shareholders should reject his candidacy at this critical time. Amy Alving. Dr. Alving is a leading expert on aerospace innovation and engineering, as well as cybersecurity, and is the Chair of Arconic’s Cybersecurity Advisory Subcommittee. Although she has been on the Board just six months, her contributions in these areas have been very substantial. As part of enterprise risk management, Arconic is highly focused on improving its cyber-security fluency; Dr. Alving’s deep expertise directly addresses this core need. Ulrich Schmidt. Mr. Schmidt has over 22 years of aerospace and financial experience. He was one of the three directors nominated by Elliott to join the Board last February and serves as Chair of the Audit Committee, in addition to serving on the Governance and Nominating Committee and Finance Committee. Our Board believes in responsible, thoughtful change targeted to create sustainable shareholder value. We have been willing to shed businesses, acquire others, split the company to create two independent firms and make a swift and decisive change in leadership. We have augmented our Board, modified our strategies and redesigned our compensation plans. So, this election is not about whether Arconic should stand still or change. We will continue to evolve and change. In fact, Arconic’s proposed Board includes nine directors who will have joined in just the last 16 months, making it one of the shortest tenured Boards in the S&P 500. A strong first quarter as an independent Company, on track to create shareholder value We are proud that Arconic is positioned well for the future. Last week, we announced strong earnings for the first quarter of 2017 – our first full quarter as a standalone company. Revenue was up 4.5% year over year, and strong performance and continued cost savings allowed Arconic to deliver net income that exceeded expectations. Our earnings announcement is a strong first data point that we are on the right path after the highly complex separation transaction that the Company executed this past November. Significant shareholder value has been created in just the first few months since the separation was completed. Arconic has a clear strategy to harness innovation, control costs and deepen our close customer relationships to generate value for shareholders. Our customers agree: Airbus, Boeing, United Technologies and GE Aviation have all expressed support for the strategy Arconic’s Board has endorsed. To keep the business healthy and build sustainable shareholder value, we need to ensure we continue to execute the right strategy, appoint a permanent CEO who will focus on value creation, and not compromise on sound governance. To do these things, we need your support and your vote. Please vote for the principles and people that will create the best Arconic for shareholders. Vote on the White card for the Board’s recommended nominees. Unanimously, The Board of Directors of Arconic Inc.   VOTE USING THE WHITE PROXY CARD. The Arconic Annual Meeting of Shareholders will take place on May 25, 2017 at 9:00 a.m. in Purchase, New York.

Friday, 05 May 2017 اردو Türkçe العربیة فارسی Toggle navigation TASNIM NEWS .com Home All Stories Politics Economy World Defense Nuclear Society/Culture Science Sports Tourism Other Media Photos Cartoons Interview UKEF in Talks with Iran to Facilitate Financing of Aircraft Sales: Official News ID: 1397815 Service: Economy May, 04, 2017 - 16:34 TEHRAN (Tasnim) – Iran's Deputy Transport Minister Asghar Fakhrieh Kashan said UK Export Finance (UKEF) is in talks with the Islamic Republic to facilitate the financing of aircraft sales to the country’s national flag-carrier airline Iran Air. "We have received some offers from UKEF, that is under review by Iran," Fakhrieh Kashan told Reuters on Thursday. He added that the UKEF, a government agency responsible for the UK's share of European government export financing for Airbus sales, had tentatively offered support for least some Airbus jets built in Britain, France, Germany and Spain.  It could also offer some support to Airbus's US rival, Boeing, the Iranian official added. According to the report, if UKEF provides support for Boeing deliveries, it would not be the first time, but it would be rare. The main proviso is that a certain proportion of parts in each jet need to be made in Britain - usually 20 percent. For Boeing exports, that would typically mean the jets would have to have Rolls-Royce engines. The Boeing planes ordered by Iran all have engines made by US supplier General Electric or GE and its French partner Safran. On April 4, Iran signed an agreement with Boeing for buying dozens of the company’s twinjet narrow-body passenger planes. The agreement involves the purchase of 30 Boeing 737 MAX planes as well as the purchase rights for an additional 30 planes of the same class. It was signed between Iran’s Aseman Airlines and Boeing in Tehran. Boeing is to provide 50 planes of the same type to Iran Air through a similar agreement. The overall value of Iran Air’s order that also involves 30 long-range wide-body 777 aircraft is estimated to be $16.6 billion. During a January 2016 visit to Paris by Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, Tehran also signed a major contract with Airbus worth about $27 billion to buy 118 planes.

This Smart News Release features multimedia. View the full release here: http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20170504005759/en/ In a separate release also issued today, the Company announced its nomination of former Boeing Commercial Airplanes President and Chief Executive Officer James “Jim” F. Albaugh and Air Force retired General Janet Wolfenbarger for election to Arconic’s Board of Directors at the Company’s 2017 Annual Meeting. Mr. Albaugh and General Wolfenbarger will stand for election with current directors David Hess, Amy Alving and Ulrich Schmidt. Additional information, including the letter to shareholders, investor presentation and supplemental proxy materials are available at www.arconic.com/annualmeeting. The Company urges shareholders to vote “FOR” the Company’s new slate of five director nominees and governance proposals on the WHITE proxy card. The full text of the letter follows: Dear Fellow Shareholders: We are writing to ask you to vote for the slate of directors nominated by the Arconic Board of Directors at the upcoming 2017 Annual Meeting of Shareholders. Our director candidates are all accomplished professionals who will help guide Arconic as it recruits a permanent Chief Executive Officer and builds upon its strong first quarter 2017 financial results. Three of our nominees are current Board members (none having served for more than 16 months), and two are entirely new nominees who have not yet served on Arconic’s Board. One commitment, though, binds them together: an unwavering dedication to shareholder interests. We recently made several attempts to settle the disruptive proxy contest started by Elliott Management (“Elliott”). Despite our best efforts, we were unsuccessful. Elliott agreed to end the fight on terms both sides indicated were acceptable. Then Elliott reneged. We resumed discussions and then Elliott agreed again, though on different terms. Elliott then reneged. Again. We tried, nevertheless, to end the battle by offering two Board seats to the candidates Elliott has nominated. Notably, and reflecting Elliott’s pervasive influence over its nominees, none of Elliott’s director candidates accepted our offer. An outstanding director slate, dedicated to serving your interests We have now recruited two exceptional new director nominees for the Board who are purely independent. They join our slate alongside three current Board members – our Interim CEO, the head of our Audit Committee and the head of our Cybersecurity Subcommittee. Together, these five nominees bring decades of experience in aerospace and defense. We hope you will join us in voting for them. Our new nominees are: James “Jim” F. Albaugh, an internationally recognized aerospace executive who was the President and Chief Executive Officer of Boeing Commercial Airplanes until his retirement in 2012. Prior to that role, Mr. Albaugh was President and CEO of Boeing Integrated Defense Systems and President of Rocketdyne Propulsion and Power. Mr. Albaugh is the Chairman of the National Aeronautic Association, past Chairman of the Aerospace Industries Association and serves on the Boards of American Airlines and Harris Corporation. He holds a Master’s degree in Civil Engineering from Columbia University and is an elected member of the National Academy of Engineering. The aerospace segment represents close to half of Arconic’s overall revenue today and has significant prospects for the future. Mr. Albaugh brings a deep understanding of the aerospace segment’s needs. Janet C. Wolfenbarger, a retired four-star general who was responsible for procurement, science and technology, test and evaluation, logistics and supply chain for the U.S. Air Force; she oversaw an approximately $60 billion annual budget, including a large portion of the approximately $1 billion of business that Arconic does in the defense industry. In her last military role, General Wolfenbarger oversaw an organization of 80,000 people and led significant restructuring of the Air Force Materiel Command to improve efficiency. General Wolfenbarger was the first female four-star general in Air Force history. Among her many accomplishments, General Wolfenbarger holds a Master’s degree in Aeronautics and Astronautics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Both of these new nominees know Arconic from having served as respected leaders at important Arconic customers. They bring operating experience and commercial insights that we believe will help optimize the Company and its strategy for many years. We are confident that these two nominees, like our other nominees, are independent and objective and seeking only to serve Arconic using their best judgment and insights from decades of relevant experience. The reality is that regardless of who wins this proxy fight, there will be change in the Board, and there will be new perspectives. Our slate of nominees has five new directors: two who have never served on our Board, two who have served for fewer than seven months and one who was originally nominated by Elliott and who joined the Board just last year. So, your choice at this meeting is not really about “change” or “no change.” The most important decision this Board will make in the coming months is the selection of a new CEO. Arconic’s recommended Board is without question best placed to select the next CEO, given its deep industry expertise and view of the marketplace. Your choice is about some important principles and some critical people.Strong governance over questionable tactics Elliott has had three primary goals during its campaign: Remove the sitting CEO and steer the selection of his replacement; Shape a majority of the Arconic Board; and Dictate the direction of key Board decisions and processes. Since Arconic’s CEO stepped down, Elliott has shifted its attacks to the Board level with increasingly personal attacks on directors and hyperbolic assertions that the Board is weak on governance. Elliott’s latest attack theme – “subversion of shareholder democracy” – is ironically being deployed in an effort to enable one 13.2% shareholder to shape a majority of the Board. If successful, Elliott will have nominated seven of Arconic’s 13 directors. A weak-governance Board would have ended this fight to spare itself Elliott’s unfair attacks. We could have agreed, via settlement, to Elliott’s over-reaching demands, including its insistence on appointing a majority of both an Operating Committee and the CEO Search Committee. But Arconic’s Board has refused to allow one shareholder these unilateral rights; instead we are focused on full shareholder representation and participation. For our part, we believe public companies should be run for all shareholders and should be governed ethically. We also believe that: In the public markets, no single minority investor should have the right to shape a majority of the Board, select a CEO, or unilaterally define how a Board organizes itself and operates; Hedge funds should not have free reign to level false or unsubstantiated accusations with the aim of embarrassing, ruining or damaging people. We believe that a vote on Elliott’s proxy card is a vote of encouragement for activists who demand undue influence as Elliott has clearly demanded at Arconic, and for activists to use tactics of personal destruction as their means. The right kind of change to keep Arconic on a strong path Your choice at the 2017 Annual Meeting is between two sets of directors – both essentially new to Arconic. Shareholders should ask themselves – which set is most qualified to be stewards of their investment and this Company? We believe that our nominees – including Mr. Albaugh and retired General Wolfenbarger – bring substantially more relevant expertise to the Board than those nominated by Elliott. We welcome your thoughtful evaluation of the two director slates. Our nominees also include: David Hess. Mr. Hess has more than 38 years of operational and leadership experience in aerospace and deep knowledge of jet engine technology and manufacturing. As our interim CEO, Mr. Hess has been a stabilizing force at Arconic during a time of leadership transition. We do not believe that shareholders should reject his candidacy at this critical time. Amy Alving. Dr. Alving is a leading expert on aerospace innovation and engineering, as well as cybersecurity, and is the Chair of Arconic’s Cybersecurity Advisory Subcommittee. Although she has been on the Board just six months, her contributions in these areas have been very substantial. As part of enterprise risk management, Arconic is highly focused on improving its cyber-security fluency; Dr. Alving’s deep expertise directly addresses this core need. Ulrich Schmidt. Mr. Schmidt has over 22 years of aerospace and financial experience. He was one of the three directors nominated by Elliott to join the Board last February and serves as Chair of the Audit Committee, in addition to serving on the Governance and Nominating Committee and Finance Committee. Our Board believes in responsible, thoughtful change targeted to create sustainable shareholder value. We have been willing to shed businesses, acquire others, split the company to create two independent firms and make a swift and decisive change in leadership. We have augmented our Board, modified our strategies and redesigned our compensation plans. So, this election is not about whether Arconic should stand still or change. We will continue to evolve and change. In fact, Arconic’s proposed Board includes nine directors who will have joined in just the last 16 months, making it one of the shortest tenured Boards in the S&P 500. A strong first quarter as an independent Company, on track to create shareholder value We are proud that Arconic is positioned well for the future. Last week, we announced strong earnings for the first quarter of 2017 – our first full quarter as a standalone company. Revenue was up 4.5% year over year, and strong performance and continued cost savings allowed Arconic to deliver net income that exceeded expectations. Our earnings announcement is a strong first data point that we are on the right path after the highly complex separation transaction that the Company executed this past November. Significant shareholder value has been created in just the first few months since the separation was completed. Arconic has a clear strategy to harness innovation, control costs and deepen our close customer relationships to generate value for shareholders. Our customers agree: Airbus, Boeing, United Technologies and GE Aviation have all expressed support for the strategy Arconic’s Board has endorsed. To keep the business healthy and build sustainable shareholder value, we need to ensure we continue to execute the right strategy, appoint a permanent CEO who will focus on value creation, and not compromise on sound governance. To do these things, we need your support and your vote. Please vote for the principles and people that will create the best Arconic for shareholders.

Speaking to the RIA Novosti news agency on Thursday, an official from Irkut Corporation confirmed that "the first flying model MC-21 has moved from the final assembly shop to the flight testing division to prepare for the first flight." Details on the plane's expected flight testing schedule remain scarce, with the official telling RIA Novosti that the date for the first flight has yet to be confirmed. Speaking to Russia's Izvestia newspaper, a separate official explained that the aircraft will now need to pass a series of ground tests, including fueling, running its engines in different operating modes, testing all on-board systems, taxiing on the runway, speeding up to liftoff speed, and braking at speed; only after all this will flight testing begin. © Sputnik/ Mikhail Voskresenskiy Rising Like a Phoenix: New Russian Airliner Engine Will Be Able to Compete With Boeing, AirbusIrkut Corporation is betting big with its prospective new airliner. When released, it will be competing directly against the Boeing-737 and the Airbus A-320 in the most capacious segment of the global commercial aviation market: mid-range travel. Russian observers expect the MC-21 to fare well against the US and European heavyweights. The MC-21 is designed to be faster, more efficient, and less expensive than its Western counterparts, having incorporated the latest in the field of aircraft construction, engine technology and avionics systems in its design.  For instance, while the Airbus A-320 and Boeing-737 have cruising speeds of 828 km/h and 842 km/h, respectively, the MC-21 is expected to have a cruising speed of 870 km/h. Furthermore, the plane's cost per unit is expected to run somewhere in the neighborhood of $72-$85 million US, depending on modification. Its Western analogues, by contrast, can run tens of millions more in their base price. © Photo: aviationunion.org Prospective designs for the MC-21, including the MC-21-200, a 150 passenger variant, the MC-21-300, a 180 passenger variant, and the MC-21-400, a 210 passenger variant. On the environmental front too, the MC-21 has been designed to come out on top, with pollution emissions reduced by 20% lower than Boeing and Airbus, and service costs are 12-15% lower. © Sputnik/ Grigoriy Sisoev Iran Interested in Purchase of 100 Sukhoi Superjet PlanesAccording to Irkut Corporation's calculations, airlines can expect to save up to $3 million per year operating the MC-21 compared with the US and European planes. The MC-21 incorporates a composite wing design – the first of its kind for a domestic civilian aircraft of this class. The first prototype plane to roll off the production line has been fitted with PW1400G engines from the American engine firm Pratt & Whitney. Future MC-21s will be equipped with the Russian PD-14, a family of modern engines built by Russia's Aviadvigatel aircraft engine manufacturer. © Photo: Wikipedia/Vitaly V. Kuzmin A PD-14 engine on display. Irkut Corporation had previously indicated that it already has firm orders for 175 planes, with another 100 possible orders confirmed. Aeroflot, Russia's flag carrier airline, will become the plane's first domestic operator. The company has plans to buy 50 aircraft. Pending successful flight testing, deliveries of the MC-21 are expected to begin sometime between late 2018 and early 2019. United Aircraft Corporation, Irkut's parent company, has indicated that they plan to market the aircraft not only in Russia, but also in foreign markets. India, China, Southeast Asia and Latin America are all seen as strong potential markets, given their experience with Soviet and Russian aviation technology in the civilian and military sectors, and the absence of trade preferences given to Boeing and Airbus in their home areas. © Photo: Dmitry Terekhov Phoenix Rising: How the New Il-96-400M Airliner Can Help Revive Russia's Civil Aviation IndustryFollowing its debut, in addition to competing with Boeing and Airbus, the MC-21 will begin replacing the leftover Soviet-era Tupolevs, Yaks and Antonovs operating in Russia's commercial aviation park. Asked to comment on the MC-21's long-awaited rollout, aviation expert, distinguished military pilot, and deputy-editor-in-chief of Russia's Aviapanorama magazine Vladimir Popov told Radio Sputnik that it was a good indicator of the state of the Russian aviation industry, for several reasons. For one thing, Popov noted, "this aircraft will be made of 40% composite materials. It has new engines, a more efficient propulsion system, new more sophisticated avionics, a glass cabin – traditional for combat planes – and this on a civilian aircraft." © Wikipedia/ An MC-21 on the assembly line at Irkut Corporation's plant in Irkutsk, Russia. © Photo: vaso.ru Russia Developing 'Transformer' Flying TankerEffectively, the expert stressed that the MC-21 was another example of the revival of the Russian passenger aircraft sector. "This is a very important factor for the development and the establishment of our aviation industry at a new level. We already have the Sukhoi Superjet 100 [a smaller twin-engine regional passenger airliner], and now we have the MC-21, for which we waited a long time, and is finally arriving. This is a very good sign." Popov emphasized that he has no doubts about the MC-21's ability to compete with Western aircraft. "It is competitive with Boeing and Airbus, because it is manufactured on a new production base that incorporates modern technologies," the expert noted. "This is an economically viable aircraft. When released, it can replace [Western] planes flying on short routes, but depending on the amount of fuel in its tanks can also perform medium-haul flights, and also be used for long-haul flights. In other words, the plane is very versatile," he added. © Photo: irkut.com The MC-21's cockpit. Development of the MC-21 first began in the late 2000s. Work intensified in 2014, after the downturn in relations with Western countries. At that time, the Russian government took a number of steps to help the country's commercial passenger aircraft industry work to regain lost market share, both domestically and abroad. © Flickr/ SuperJet International Russia Sees Prospects of SSJ100 Deliveries to New Markets - Vnesheconombank ChairmanIn the 1990s, after the collapse of the Soviet Union, Russia's massive civilian aviation industry, once accounting for nearly a third of the world total, was also brought to the brink of collapse, with production brought down to the low single-digits. Citing increasingly stringent safety and engine noise regulations and high fuel costs, Russian carriers began buying foreign aircraft, which by the early 2010s accounted two thirds or more of many major airlines' fleets. Today, with the development of the Sukhoi Superjet 100, the long-haul Ilyushin Il-96 with advanced new engines, and now, the Irkut MC-21, the civil aviation industry's future looks bright, so long as the government remains committed to this time and technology-intensive sector. ...

Most Popular SpaceX By Jay Bennett May 3, 2017 A purple Mylar party balloon pushes up against the lofted ceiling, a leftover remnant of some less technical and more carefree event that must have graced the Kennedy Caucus Room of the Russell Senate Building earlier this weekend, considering the structural integrity of the balloon. On the morning of Monday, May 1, however, the ornate chamber is the setting for a more sober affair. Leaders of space industry and policy have met to discuss how to make traveling to space more affordable—and our final frontier dreams of the future achievable. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Air Force generals, NASA reps, a member of President Trump's transition team, executives for private spaceflight companies (including SpaceX, Blue Origin, and United Launch Alliance), and former politicians have gathered here. The sentiment of the room is palpable: The culture of NASA needs to change. "The elephant in the room is SLS and Orion" Most Popular A Bloated Bureaucracy? If you came out of the Ultra Low-Cost Access to Space symposium (ULCATS) thinking one thing, it would be that NASA is swollen and inefficient. By the time the Space Launch System (SLS) flies in 2019—hopefully—building the big new rocket will have taken 15 years and cost more than $20 billion since George W. Bush announced in 2004 that NASA would return to the moon, with billions spent on the Ares rockets that went nowhere. That's not counting the Orion spacecraft, which has sucked up about $14 billion itself. As former Chair of the House Science Committee Robert Walker pointed out, when it takes more than a decade to develop a technology, the technology is obsolete by the time it is finished. "The elephant in the room is SLS and Orion," said Laetitia Garriott de Cayeux, cofounder of the space technology company Escape Dynamics and a continuing advisor to NASA. By contrast, it took SpaceX four years to develop the Falcon 9 rocket and Dragon spacecraft after it won funding through NASA's Commercial Orbital Transportation Services (COTS) program in 2006. Elon Musk's company completed its first ISS resupply mission two years after the Falcon 9's first flight, and it landed a Falcon 9 first stage two years after that, using $396 million in federal money and about $450 million in private capital during that time. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Meanwhile, Blue Origin, Amazon billionaire Jeff Bezos' space group, has successfully launched and landed the same New Shepard suborbital rocket first stage five times now. It is developing a larger orbital rocket as well, New Glenn, all without taking a dime of public money. ULA has received billions in military contracts since it was founded in 2006, but the Boeing-Lockheed alliance currently flies a suite of four successful rockets, including the Delta IV Heavy, which has the highest payload capacity of any launch vehicle currently operated: 63,470 pounds. And yet, the time to cancel SLS in favor of more efficient solutions has long since passed. Although space organizations such as the influential Planetary Society have previously called for the program to be canceled and many still see it as a boondoggle, SLS may now be too big to fail. At this point, there has been too much money invested and we are too close to reaping some benefit to just throw the launch vehicle away. Although the mammoth rocket will cost some $500 million per launch, it will be able to lift about three to four times the mass of the Delta IV Heavy, which itself costs $375 million per launch. Plus, the rocket is now part of President Trump's plans. His preliminary budget draft for 2018 suggests the SLS and Orion programs will continue to push his desired expansion in manned spaceflight.

NASA/MAF/Steven Seipel Advertisement - Continue Reading Below So the ULCATS attendees probably can't stop the SLS train. Instead, they want the U.S. to create an environment in space exploration that fosters innovation and brings about the survival-of-the-fittest competition of private industry. Speaker after speaker argued that private ventures have demonstrated that they can succeed where NASA and the Air Force have failed—in developing reusable and low-cost launch vehicles and spacecraft that will drive down price, drive up launch volume, and increase access to space to such a degree that the average American could think realistically about what they might want to launch into orbit. Most Popular "NASA requires political support driven by jobs in Congress," said de Cayeux, pointing out that this dynamic removes an economic incentive to innovate within the space agency. "You could argue that it works directly against this goal." Colonizing Space So are we going to get off this rock, or are we not? Newt Gingrich has his answer. "If space becomes cheap, we will actually colonize the moon in your lifetime," said the former Speaker of the House during a speech at the ULCATS symposium. Gingrich has been an avid advocate for aggressive space exploration for decades, and along with Robert Walker, he encouraged NASA and the Air Force to start developing reusable launch vehicles and move away from disposables in the late 1980s. Gingrich went on to say that humans would continue on to Mars, even as far out as Saturn, "with vehicles that are really much closer to the Enterprise than what we have currently." Evoking a sci-fi spaceship that flies faster than light might seem silly, but Gingrich brings up a good point about spacecraft size. The crewed spacecraft we are building now—primarily NASA's Orion, SpaceX's Dragon, and Boeing's CST-100 Starliner—are limited to four to seven passengers because of a specific hindrance: These craft are designed to launch from Earth where there is a lot of gravity. If we could set up manufacturing capabilities in orbit and on the moon, we could construct a ship in space, one potentially large enough to carry dozens or even hundreds of people in the far future. It's not hard to see that the first step to such a reality is making launches cheaper. The Air Force officers believe that at some point it will be necessary to establish a Space Service—a completely new branch of the military. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below United Launch Alliance is one of the most optimistic companies when it comes to predictions of future industry growth in space. The company talks about its "cislunar vision," referring to the space between Earth and the moon. In the coming decades, ULA envisions an outer space industry to mine the moon and nearby asteroids, produce rocket propellant from lunar water and store it in orbit, establish fiber optic networks in space, and develop 3D printing methods for space manufacturing. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Leslie Kovacs, ULA's director for executive affairs in Washington D.C., listed off the company's glowing estimates about the markets of tomorrow. We could achieve a $500 billion industry in space with a few dozen workers stationed in orbit in the next 5 to 15 years, Kovacs said. At first the "cislunar marketplace" would rely on disposable rockets, but as reusables become the norm, private industry in space would grow and propellant production would take off to provide fuel for additional missions. In 30 years, ULA projects a $2.7 trillion industry in space with 1,000 permanently stationed workers as people travel to and from the moon. Most Popular Now, many people at the conference pointed out that these figures are largely meaningless, particularly the far-flung future ones. Even so, the general consensus is that there are serious industrial and manufacturing opportunities in space, particularly in space mining and rocket fuel production. The primary barrier is the high cost of rocket launches. Jean Floyd is president and CEO of Stratolaunch, which is owned by Paul Allen and is working with Scaled Composites to develop aircraft that could carry rockets to high altitude where they would then launch. Floyd argued that once you make space an affordable market, uses for that market that no one ever considered will sprout up. As for two of the biggest players, SpaceX and Blue Origin, the former is very serious about "making humanity a multiplanitary species," said Tim Hughes, Senior Vice President of SpaceX, and the latter believes it has a real opportunity to develop reusable landers for the moon. Elon Musk has instructed his camp to begin work on a new massive launch vehicle to take people to Mars, and Jeff Bezos has given marching orders to convert the New Shepard rocket into a lunar variant.

The Military Aspect Air Force leaders in attendance, such as Lieutenant General David Deptula, Deputy Chief of Staff for USAF Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance, echoed the notion of working hand-in-hand with private industry, in part because partnerships could give the United States a leg up over its adversaries in developing sophisticated space infrastructure. Exactly how to do that is still a challenge, however. The military officers discussed multiple possibilities, including establishing a new program office that would oversee the relationship between the DoD and private space companies. But Joshua Hartman from the consulting firm Reconnaissance Strategic Advisors pointed out that this would not be a traditional program office, as it would face the challenge of balancing commercial and government security interests. The Air Force officers also believe that at some point, it will be necessary to establish a Space Service—a completely new branch of the military. A Delta IV Heavy launches a satellite for the National Reconnaissance Office from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California, January 20, 2011. U.S. Air Force/Joe Davila Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Bob Martinage, former Deputy Undersecretary of the Navy, said that once America has significant assets in space, those assets will need to be defended. Newt Gingrich put it another way: "Frankly, you're going to have to have military space because the Chinese won't give you any choice." The space industry is imminent. World peace is not. Major General Roger Teague, Director of USAF Space Programs, pointed out that America's adversaries are perfectly aware of the potential military advantages of space infrastructure: including secure and ubiquitous communications networks; sophisticated intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities; and possibly even "kinetic" operations, meaning the deployment of weapons from space. China and Russia are both starting to invest heavily in reusable launch technologies, though China in particular is advancing at a rapid pace. When asked whether another nation could surprise the United States and develop sophisticated space defense systems first, the military brass on hand had to at least acknowledge the possibility. The China National Space Agency's (CNSA) second orbiting space research laboratory, Tiangong-2, launched on September 15, 2016. The station is docked with a Shenzhou 11 spacecraft. China Space Report When it comes to the capabilities that the military is looking for in space, the focus is deterrence. "The art of war is not about winning a fight," said Lieutenant General Steven Kwast, Commander and President of the USAF's Air University. "If you're fighting, you've already failed deterrence." Deterrence could come in the form of satellite networks, likely small CubeSats, that would number in the hundreds or thousands to prevent enemies from knocking them all out. These networks could provide communications relays or data transfer platforms. ISR satellites were also a primary focus, and Martinage pointed out that in-orbit refueling would be invaluable to keeping these satellites on the move, out of harm's way. And yes, "kinetic" capabilities were discussed as well—always in the guarded euphemisms of military lingo. "Frankly," Newt Gingrich said, "you're going to have to have military space because the Chinese won't give you any choice." The Next Steps We need to get launch costs low enough for more people to launch payloads to space. But once we do, the snowball will start to roll, and the real savings will come from a massive increase in the number of launches. Whether military, commercial, or scientific, the more we launch, the cheaper it will be. Most Popular "We are sitting at the edge of one of the most brilliant opportunities in history," said Gingrich during his speech, "to break into the future that Robert Heinlein wrote about." When asked by an audience member what the next step is, Gingrich said President Trump or Vice President Pence would likely soon deliver a speech that identifies low-cost spaceflight and reusability as the future. After that, a National Space Council will be established by executive order for the first time since 1993, likely to be chaired by Mike Pence—a move that is "imminent," said Robert Walker, who served as an advisor on space policy during the presidential campaign. "The executive order has been written. It's all set to go," said Walker. "I can tell you firsthand that Vice President Pence is extremely excited about his ability to be the chair of that council, and I expect it to be a very active part of this administration." Concept of a space habitat orbiting the moon. Lockheed Martin There are also plenty of engineering challenges that need to be met here on Earth. Martinage argued that our existing spaceflight infrastructure will need to be upgraded, saying of ranges and launch facilities, "we don't have enough, and it's old." Richard Dunn, the first General Counsel of DARPA from 1987 to 2000, said that education would be crucial, not only to train a new workforce for space industries, but to inspire kids to study STEM subjects so they can drive the coming revolution in space technologies. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below "I really think the next decade is going to be as exciting or more exciting than the Apollo program," said Gingrich. One of the lingering questions here was this: What should be the new role of NASA? James Reuter, the only NASA representative to speak, talked about the need to develop technologies for in-situ resource harvesting and manufacturing on other planets. "There is a large interest in places where you need to construct a habitat with indigenous materials." These are the types of projects and studies that speakers at the conference argued NASA should focus on, while handing the reigns of vehicle manufacturing over to the private sector. The Mars 2020 rover, for example, will carry an instrument called the Mars Oxygen ISRU Experiment, or MOXIE, that will produce oxygen from the Martian atmosphere of mostly carbon dioxide—a critical technology to ultimately allow future astronauts to produce oxygen for life support systems and fuel production on the Red Planet. NASA, the conference attendees believe, should stick to research experiments focused on the far future, so that when the time comes the research is available to develop new technologies on a large scale. NASA Golden Spikes and Kitty Hawk The leaders planning a big space future know such grand plans sound crazy to some people. As justification for these programs, the conference attendees loved to point to two breakthroughs they see as analogues to the space revolution: the transcontinental railroad and the birth of aviation. The first transcontinental railroad was an early example of success in a public-private partnership, with funding from the U.S. government as well as private interests that had made their fortunes in the preceding industrial revolution. The train was also shrouded in uncertainty. When the two sides began building, many people questioned whether the railroad companies would be able to blast through the Rocky Mountains at all. Fixed-wing aircraft were a similar triumph over the doubters. Lt. Gen. Kwast alluded to an October 9 1903 article in the New York Times written after a reporter visited Samuel Pierpont Langley to see the progress of Langley's flying machines, a venture that had been funded by War Department grants from the Smithsonian totaling $70,000. The Times reporter wrote in the article "Flying Machines Which Do Not Fly:" It might be assumed that the flying machine which will really fly might be evolved by the combined and continuous efforts of mathematicians and mechanicians in from one million to ten million years—provided, of course, we can meanwhile eliminate such little drawbacks and embarrassments as the existing relation between weight and strength in inorganic materials. On that very day, on the Outer Banks of North Carolina, Orville Wright wrote in his diary: "We started assembly today."

Carney | Washington Examiner On April 12, 2017, former Boeing CEO Jim McNerney sat down in the West Wing with President Trump. Trump had, on the campaign trail, advocated abolishing the Export-Import Bank, a federal agency that typically subsidizes $10 billion a year in Boeing exports. On April 13, Trump announced he would fill out Ex-Im's board of directors, thus reviving the agency's ability to subsidize Boeing's overseas customers. This was a replay from eight years earlier. Candidate Barack Obama had called Ex-Im "little more than a slush fund for corporate welfare." Obama soon picked McNerney and General Electric CEO Jeff Immelt as his manufacturing czar and jobs czar, respectively. GE is arguably Ex-Im's No. 2 beneficiary. Obama quickly came around on the agency, and became Ex-Im's most important ally in Washington.

State TV showed what appeared to be a normal take off from Pudong airport in Shanghai. The plane is a key symbol of Beijing's soaring ambitions to enter the global aviation market. The jet by state-owned firm Comac has been planned since 2008 but the flight was repeatedly pushed back. For Friday's maiden flight, the plane carried only its skeleton crew of five pilots and engineers and took off in front of a crown of thousands of dignitaries, aviation workers and enthusiasts. Ahead of the flight, state television said the plane would fly at an altitude of only 3,000 metres (9,800 feet), some 7,000 metres lower than a regular trip, and reach a speed of around 300 kilometres (186 miles) per hour. The C919 is designed to be a direct competitor to Boeing's 737 and the Airbus A320. It's estimated that the global aviation market will be worth $2tn (£1.55tn) over the next 20 years. China's new pride of the skies Media playback is unsupported on your device Media captionRobin Brant tours the C919 The C919 is a single-aisle twin-engine plane with a capacity to seat up to 168 passengers. It will have a range of between 4,075 and 5,555km (2,532 - 3,452 miles). According to Chinese media, it will cost around $50m, less than half of a Boeing 737 or Airbus A320. The plane still relies on a wide array of imported technology though, it is for instance powered by engines from French-US supplier CFM International. Orders have already been placed for more than 500 of the planes, with commitments from 23 customers, say officials, mainly Chinese airlines. The main customer is China Eastern Airlines. Image copyright Getty Images Europe's aviation safety regulator has started the certification process for the C919 - a crucial step for the aircraft to be successful on the international market. China has had ambitions to build its own civil aircraft industry since the 1970s, when leader Mao Zedong's wife, Jiang Qing, personally backed a project. But the Y-10, built in the late 1970s, was impractical due to its heavy weight and only three of the aircraft were ever made.

The maiden test flight of the C919 airliner made a successful takeoff from Shanghai Pudong International Airport on Friday, according to a livestream via Twitter carried on China's official news agency Xinhua. The plane's flight path and flying time are not yet known, but a large crowd has gathered at the airport waiting for the landing. The C919 has more than 150 seats and a range of 4,075 kilometers (2,532 miles), and is meant to compete with the Airbus A320 and Boeing 737, among the most popular commercial planes flying in the skies. Commercial Aircraft Corp. of China, the state-owned company behind the plane, said 21 customers had placed orders for more than 500 planes by the end of 2016, and it expected sales to exceed 2,000, state media said. Livestream Tweet China is making a big push to become a global aviation player, looking to compete with the likes of Airbus and Boeing. Establishing itself in this industry has been hailed a "strategic move" by President Xi Jinping, according to written remarks published by state media outlets. Beijing has also identified domestic development and production of engines and planes as a major goal. Friday's maiden flight will be a key milestone for the C919, which has been plagued by delays. Final ground tests only concluded a few weeks ago, much later than the original schedule of a first flight in 2014, and aircraft delivery in 2016. Still, it will still be a while before travelers can board the plane – the C919 still needs to undergo other safety and certification checks. China is expected to beat the U.S. as the world's largest aviation market by 2024, according to the International Air Transport Association. And it's going to be big business for a range of sectors, from tourism to airplane makers as the country's airlines buy more planes and add more routes. Boeing has estimated that China will need to buy up $1 trillion worth of planes – about 6,810 sets of wings – over the next two decades in order to meet demand. — Barry Huang contributed to this story.

REUTERS/Stringer 5/5 SHANGHAI China's home-grown C919 passenger jet took to the skies in Shanghai for its long-delayed maiden test flight on Friday, a major step for Beijing as it looks to boost its profile in the global aviation market. The narrow-body aircraft, which will compete with Boeing's (BA.N) 737 and the Airbus (AIR.PA) A320, is a key symbol of China's ambitions to muscle into a global jet market estimated to be worth $2 trillion over the next 20 years. Made by state-owned Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC) [CMAFC.UL], the C919's test flight had been delayed at least twice since 2014 due to production issues.

Here are facts about the jet: - The single-aisle twin-engine plane was made by state planemaker Commercial Aircraft Corp of China (COMAC), with seating for 158 to 168 passengers, but the maiden flight will be made with no passenger seats. - The plane will have a range of between 4,075 kilometers and 5,555 kilometers (2,532 miles - 3,452 miles). - China Eastern Airlines is the launch customer for the plane, which is powered by engines from French-U.S. supplier CFM International, jointly owned by General Electric and Safran. - Other parts come from global suppliers such as Honeywell International Inc, United Technologies Corp's subsidiary Goodrich, Rockwell Collins Inc and Parker-Hannifin Corp unit Parker Aerospace. - COMAC has just over 50 people in its sales and marketing departments, a fraction of those at Boeing and Airbus. - The C919, nicknamed "Big Nine" and "Fatty Nine", has chalked up 570 firm orders and commitments from 23 customers, mainly Chinese state-backed airlines and leasing companies. - Its only foreign buyer so far is leasing firm GE Capital Aviation Services, owned by General Electric. - The safety certification of the new plane - which state media says will have a catalog price tag of around $50 million, less than half that of a Boeing 737 or Airbus A320 - could be among the biggest issues for the C919 internationally. - Europe's aviation safety regulator has said it has started the certification process for the C919 aircraft, a sign of closer ties between the two aviation markets.

Boeing's China rival mounts challenge using US technology  05 May 2017 - 0:28 Bloomberg Out of more than 1,000 flights scheduled to take off or land at Shanghai’s vast Pudong International Airport on Friday, one marks the beginning of a new era in the aviation business. China is making its boldest attempt yet to break the stranglehold that Airbus SE and Boeing Co. have on the market for big commercial airliners. After years of delays, the nation’s first modern large jet is expected to make its maiden flight. “The C919 will be a game-changer for China’s aerospace industry,” said Corrine Png, chief executive officer of Singapore-based research firm Crucial Perspective. The 158-174 seat C919 is made by state-owned Commercial Aircraft Corp. of China Ltd. and follows Comac’s development of a smaller, regional jet, the ARJ21, that was flown by a Chinese airline for the first time last year. The C919 brings Comac to the table in one of the most lucrative sectors of commercial aviation, competing head-to-head with Boeing’s ubiquitous 737 and Airbus’s A320. The C919’s first flight is set for about 2:00 p.m. local time in Shanghai, Xinmin reported, citing the control center handling the event. Flights at Pudong between 1:00 p.m. and 3:30 p.m. may be delayed due to the new jetliner’s maiden trip. Behind the celebrations of a Made-in-China jet is the reality that Comac was able to build its new plane using a string of Western suppliers. At least 15 foreign partners such as General Electric Co., Safran SA and Honeywell International Inc. worked on components and systems of the C919. “Comac has really leaned on the experience of its suppliers,” said Tom Szlosek, chief financial officer at Honeywell. “We’re adding a lot of value.” Tapping into the supply chains of Airbus and Boeing allows Comac to bypass many of the technical challenges of making a modern commercial jet from scratch and builds up the company’s expertise for future designs. “It’s impractical for Comac not to take advantage of technologies that are already out there,” said Yu Zhanfu, a principal at Roland Berger Strategy Consultants in Beijing. “If you insist on doing everything from the ground up by yourself, chances are you will become irrelevant.” Companies based outside China supply C919 systems for flight control, power, lighting, cockpit control and much else. The engines and landing gear are from overseas manufacturers. The Chinese jet demonstrates the extent globalization has taken over the manufacture of major engineering products. Just as the jet relies on systems from firms based around the world, many of those systems are built with components that originated in China. The C919’s engines for example are made by CFM. CFM’s parents, GE and French manufacturer Safran Aircraft Engines, in turn buy more than $500 million of Chinese-made parts a year for the company’s single-aisle jet engine series, the company said. A China-designed aircraft doesn’t mean all the parts have to be made by the Chinese, said Bao Pengli, a project manager for the C919 at Comac. Some of the equipment are sourced from international suppliers to meet Comac’s standards and they not only supply Comac, but also other airplane makers around the world, he said. China’s approach is almost the opposite of the strategy followed by Japan when it was at a similar level of development. There, Japan’s aerospace companies became suppliers to Boeing, and more recently Airbus, and now make as much as 35 percent of the Boeing 787’s airframe, according to Boeing Japan. China’s decision to build its own large jet with overseas help is one reason the C919’s specifications are similar to the 737 Max and A320, said Michel Merluzeau, director of aerospace and defense market analysis for AirInsightResearch in Seattle. It should also help Comac ensure the plane is a success. Of 15 non-Chinese suppliers contacted by Bloomberg about their involvement with the C919, eight -- FACC AG, Honeywell, Parker Aerospace, UTC Aerospace Systems, Arconic, Liebherr-Aerospace, Eaton and CFM International -- responded. All expressed confidence in the new aircraft and the potential for further collaboration in China. While the emergence of a Chinese jet brings new revenue for component suppliers, it turns up the heat on the world’s two biggest planemakers in a key market for growth. Will ‘Made in China’ Threaten Boeing and Airbus?: QuickTake Q&A Boeing predicted in September that China will need over 6,800 aircraft valued at more than $1 trillion in the two decades through 2035, and three-fourths of them will be single-aisle planes. The country’s largest carrier, China Southern Airlines Co., and its units have ordered more than $15 billion of new aircraft from Airbus and Boeing since 2015. Boeing, which plans to build a facility in China, said it congratulated Comac on the development of the C919. Airbus already assembles A320s at a plant in Tianjin and said the competition would be good for the industry. U.S. labor unions aren’t so sure. “We have been sending out the alarm bells for many years now about China’s growing aerospace industry,” said Owen Herrnstadt, director of trade and globalization for the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers. “They’ve pitted Western aerospace companies against one another.” Fabrice Bregier, who runs Airbus’s jetliner arm, said at an airshow last year he expects the Chinese to become serious competitors but it would be well into the next decade before they had the range of aircraft and support network to be a global player. “The real challenge for the Chinese is not to design and operate and fly an aircraft” in the C919 category, said AirInsight’s Merluzeau. “The real challenge is how they are going to be able to demonstrate to the customer outside of China that they can support and service the aircraft.” Within China, though, Comac will benefit from strong government support, according to George Ferguson, a Bloomberg Intelligence analyst who estimates the country has committed as much as $7 billion to the program. “At some point, the government is going to say to the airlines: ’You need to buy these airplanes.”’ That support is one reason China’s attempt to build big jets is faring better than efforts in Japan and Brazil, according to a March report by RAND Corp. The report said China was “absorbing losses that would dissuade new market entrants operating on a purely private-enterprise basis.” Few doubt China’s determination to build its expertise. Comac is already working with Russia’s United Aircraft Corp. to develop a bigger, twin-aisle airliner, dubbed the C929, that would compete with the 787 and A330 models. “They’re serious about learning how to produce parts -- and producing high quality aircraft parts,” said Jeegar Kakkad, chief economist and director of policy for ADS Group, the London-based trade association representing aerospace companies in the U.K. “There is a huge learning curve for them.” Share this post Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

Rolls is preparing a pitch to Boeing as the U.S. manufacturer works on the business case for a so-called middle-of-market plane, Chief Executive Officer Warren East said in comments after the company’s annual general meeting. “The answer is that we are pursuing it,” East said Thursday at the shareholder gathering near its main manufacturing site in Derby, England. “It’s not ‘will we be pursuing it.’ We are pursuing it.” The engine would be available by 2025, when the Boeing jet is slated to enter service, he said. Rolls has been mulling ways of getting back into the market for powering short-haul jets, with the Boeing project presenting it with an opportunity to do so several years before the likely replacement of the existing 737 and Airbus SE A321 single-aisle models. While the European engine maker has grabbed a major slice of the lucrative long-haul engine sector with its Trent engine series and is also a supplier to regional and corporate planes, short-haul jets represent the backbone of the airline industry, with sales dwarfing those for bigger models. The engine being designed for the Boeing jet draws on the two main technology programs underway at Rolls-Royce, Paul Stein, the company’s chief technology officer, told reporters at the AGM. Those are the Advance engine core due to be built by 2020, and the UltraFan design featuring a new “power gearbox” and targeting a 25 percent efficiency improvement over current Rolls models. Pratt Split It’s not yet clear whether Rolls-Royce will pursue the project with a partner, though the company is open to doing so in principle if the business conditions are right, East said. “We’ve done it before,” the CEO said. “If that’s the practical way of doing it, then we might well.” He added that decisions on industrial partnerships can come “years into the process, rather than months.” Rolls previously had a 33 percent stake in the International Aero Engines AG pact with Pratt & Whitney, giving it a major presence in the short-haul market. It exited in 2011, partly because of a disagreement over future technology for the segment with Pratt pushing its geared-turbofan development for the A320neo and 737 Max upgrades. Following the exit from IAE Rolls explored a new 50:50 deal with Pratt, before abandoning the plan in 2013 amid antitrust concerns. A solo return to the sector would pit it against both the United Technologies Corp. unit and the CFM International alliance of General Electric Co. and Safran SA. Stein said that the ultrafan and geared turbofan aren’t ultimately compatible designs. The Rolls engine is being developed with a thrust range of 25,000 pounds to 110,000, making it suitable for the entire span of Boeing and Airbus jetliners, including the new middle-of-market plane, which could require 40,000 to 50,000 pounds of thrust. The aircraft, likely to be named the 797, would seat between 225 and 260 passengers, placing it between the biggest 737 and the smallest 787 Dreamliner. Initially envisaged as a successor to the 757, the longest-ever narrow-body plane, which ceased production in 2004, the aircraft is now conceived as a small twin-aisle model closer in proportions to the 767.

Sign up here. In a second showdown over the Obamacare repeal, the House narrowly passed a revised bill with a 217-213 vote. The dramatic do-or-die vote on the embattled bill chalks up a legislative victory for President Trump after weeks of uncertainty, furious lobbying, and an embarrassing defeat when the first vote was scrapped. The bill in its current form now faces a tough road in the Senate. (We’re tracking all major policy changes to the GOP’s health plan and their impacts here.) House Republicans joined the president at a celebration after the vote in the White House Rose Garden, where Trump proclaimed: “Your premiums are going to start to come down.” —Katie Robertson Senate GOP plans its own Obamacare repeal bill. The Senate has made it clear it will revise the narrowly passed health-care bill. Several key Republicans have said they will set aside the the bill and write their own version instead, a sign of how difficult it will be to deliver on seven years of promises to repeal Obamacare. To get some kind of bill through his chamber, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell will need to unite moderate and conservative wings of the party that want to pull the measure in entirely different directions. Boeing’s China rival is mounting its boldest challenge yet. The nation’s first modern large jet is expected to make its maiden flight on Friday after years of delays. The C919 plane, which was built by Comac using a string of Western suppliers, is China’s biggest attempt yet to break the stranglehold that Boeing and Airbus have on the market for big commercial airlines. The retail crisis could be coming to American groceries. Supermarkets have so far been mostly immune to the ravages of online shopping and the all around apocalyptic outlook facing the nation’s retailers. That may change when Lidl, a German retailer known for low prices and efficient operations, starts an aggressive U.S. expansion. The cut-throat competition comes during an historic bout of food deflation. Can Wal-Mart’s expensive new e-commerce operation compete with Amazon? The big-box retailer’s primary rival already dominates the cities and coasts, and it’s next stop is the heartland, home to Wal-Mart’s customer base. But a recent acquisition spree, including Jet.com, may have given Wal-Mart much-needed digital chops to catch up. Apple buys more company debt than the world’s biggest bond funds. Like many tech companies, the iPhone-maker has resisted transferring the money it earns abroad back to the U.S. to avoid triggering corporate income taxes on the earnings. Instead, it now has $148 billion of its record $257 billion cash pile invested in corporate debt alone. How did the Kremlin-funded RT channel get so powerful? U.S. intelligence officials have accused the little-watched Russian cable network of helping swing the election to Trump. RT’s coverage of U.S. politics and the war in Syria may well offer a window into the Kremlin’s PR strategy, but if the network’s largely young, left-wing journalists work on behalf of the Russian state, they hardly seem aware of it.

Related Research The Reasons Corporate Headquarters are Heading Back Downtown Downtowns Drawing Millennial Workers — and the Companies That Need to Attract Them Headquarters Decisions: Real Estate Executives Make Their Mark In Focus: Adaptive Reuse Gaining Traction in the Office Market Even with the economy on the upswing, competitive pressures are forcing companies to continue their quests to increase efficiencies and synergies within their operations. Relocating corporate headquarters is one option for doing so, as evidenced by the recent exodus of companies from their previous locations. Those making the decision about where to relocate need to consider several critical factors, whether moving headquarters within the current state or across state lines. Companies on the Move Several well-known corporations completed or announced notable corporate headquarters relocations in 2016, including General Electric, Boeing Company, Marriott International, North American Roofing, Beam Suntory, Arctic Cat, and ConAgra Brands. Many of the companies that have moved their headquarters shifted from sprawling suburban campuses that employees drove to every day to more compact urban spaces near public transportation. The renewed interest in urban environments reflects some of the more important factors that can influence the decision of companies anticipating a relocation. With Boeing's move of its defense headquarters from St. Louis, Missouri, to Washington the company will be in walking distance to the Pentagon. Business Strategy Relocating headquarters often is driven by strategic reasons. One of the overriding goals generally is to reduce overall costs through, for example, lower taxes and overhead. Relocation also can facilitate an organizational realignment that allows formerly segregated departments or functions to employ common core systems. A company that has its sales force, research and development (R&D) team, and engineers located in different satellite offices might want to combine them into one central campus. Companies sometimes consolidate locations in this way in the hope of enhancing innovation, communication, and collaboration among employees. The theory behind such a move is that the engineers who build products would be able to more easily work with the R&D folks who design the products. Relocation also might come up as part of a company's strategy regarding its real estate holdings. A company might want to sell some of its holdings (including its headquarters location) to raise the capital necessary to underwrite new initiatives. It could need larger space to expand its capacity, or it may simply want to optimize its holdings by deploying staff in a more concentrated, less spread out manner. Of course, a company must balance the potential cost savings and strategic gains associated with relocation against the costs stemming from relocation. Moving headquarters is no small task, and it is not cheap. The costs related to leasing, acquisition and disposition of property, employee relocation, and technology could outweigh the benefits. Even seemingly minor costs, like reprinting marketing and other materials with a new address, can add up. Talent Acquisition Much of the recent migration of corporate headquarters to urban areas is tied to employee recruitment. Companies believe they are better positioned to uncover and draw top talent — especially millennial talent — when they are based in major cities. In the Chicago area alone, many well-known companies are moving their headquarters from long-held suburban properties to the city, including McDonald's, Motorola Solutions, the Kraft Heinz Company, and the Hillshire Brands Company, largely motivated by their bids to attract desirable candidates from a changing workforce. Retention of existing top performers also merits consideration, though. That means a company must weigh such factors as the potential relocation site's cost of living and quality of life, which can include commute time, school district quality, and crime rates. These matters could deter valued employees from moving with the headquarters. And the company must take into account the labor costs and availability of labor to fuel or keep up with future growth. Right-to-work laws and the costs of unemployment insurance and workers' compensation coverage also might affect the relocation decision. Much of the recent migration of corporate headquarters to urban areas is tied to employee recruitment. Tax Incentives The availability of financial incentives from state and local governments can play a substantial role in the relocation decision. Many jurisdictions are willing to extend such breaks for relocating headquarters in recognition of the ripple effect these moves can have on the economy in the surrounding area, as well as the potential benefits of corporate philanthropic efforts. States offering financial incentives for headquarters relocations include: Alabama: New investment in a new site in the state might qualify for the income tax capital credit of up to 5 percent of the project's capital costs, to be applied to state income tax liability each year for 20 years. Arizona: The qualified facility tax credit is equal to the lesser of 10 percent of the total qualified investment made at the headquarters, $200,000 per qualified job created, or $30 million. Indiana: The headquarters relocation tax credit is assessed against the corporation's state tax liability. The credit can be up to 50 percent of the corporation's relocation costs. Kentucky: The Kentucky Business Investment Program offers tax credits up to 100 percent of corporate income tax liability for up to 10 years. Enhanced incentives based on wages are available in certain counties for up to 15 years. Louisiana: The Corporate Headquarters Relocation Program provides a 25 percent rebate over five years on facilities and relocation costs. Missouri: The Missouri Works Program offers eligible corporations state tax credits (which are refundable, transferable, and saleable) or the retention of the state withholding tax on new jobs. South Carolina: The corporate headquarters credit is a 20 percent credit against corporate income tax, based on the cost of the actual portion of the facility dedicated to the headquarters operation or direct lease costs for the first five years of operation. The credit potentially can eliminate corporate income taxes for 10 years. Tennessee: The Super Job Tax Credit of $5,000 per job is available for companies establishing or expanding a regional, national, or international headquarters in the state with a capital investment of $10 million or more that creates 100 headquarter jobs paying at least 150 percent of Tennessee's average occupational wage. Wisconsin: The refundable business development credit is based on the wages paid to eligible employees working in headquarters located within the state. West Virginia: Corporations that relocate their headquarters to the state are eligible for tax credits that can offset up to 100 percent of their liability for business and occupation tax. Corporate headquarters incentives for all states generally require all of the following: A minimum capital investment in new or expanded headquarters facilities; A minimum number of new jobs that meet the state's "headquarters" definition; and Worldwide sales in excess of a specified threshold. Although incentives can have a significant effect on a corporation's bottom line, it's important to remember that incentives alone rarely make a poor location suitable. Image Matters The location a corporation selects for its corporate headquarters can say a lot about its brand image. A long-lived company that is hoping to shake the perception of its being out of touch or past its prime might try to reposition itself by moving to a "hot," up-and-coming hub that reflects its priorities, such as the West Loop neighborhood in Chicago or the Silicon Beach area in Los Angeles. Case in point: When GE announced its move from Fairfield, Conn., to Boston, for example, its Chairman and CEO Jeff Immelt explained that the company wanted "to be at the center of an ecosystem that shares our aspirations. Greater Boston is home to 55 colleges and universities. Massachusetts spends more on research and development than any other region in the world, and Boston attracts a diverse, technologically fluent workforce focused on solving challenges for the world." Additional Factors Selecting the most advantageous location for a corporate headquarters also can turn on the following factors: The availability of financial incentives from state and local governments can play a substantial role in the relocation decision. Customer base: For some companies, it's vital to be near their current clients and future markets. With Boeing's move of its defense headquarters from St. Louis, Mo., to Washington, for example, the company will be in walking distance to the Pentagon. Proximity to other facilities: It makes little sense for a corporation to move its headquarters to a location that is remote from its other facilities. When GE moved its headquarters to Boston, for example, it already had almost 5,000 employees in the state of Massachusetts. Community relations: A corporation might choose to move its headquarters to a location where it already has established a solid working relationship with the nearby community (for example, the location of its manufacturing plant). Strong working relationships with local government agencies can smooth the way for abatements and incentives like tax increment financing. Public infrastructure: Corporate headquarters are often the focal point of much business travel, with employees, customers, vendors, and others regularly commuting to and from the headquarters. Multiple transportation options are essential — hub airports, road and highway systems, and possibly ports. The company also should investigate the reliability and capacity of relevant utilities, including fiberoptic wiring. Space needs: When determining space needs, a corporation must look at least 10 years forward. If necessary, is future expansion practicable at a site? Look Before You Leap Relocating corporate headquarters typically is a massive undertaking, and not one to take lightly. Before settling on a new location, a corporation must take the time to evaluate a wide range of factors based on the company's individual circumstances. Dean J.

That brought the total cost overruns on the U.S. Air Force's new tanker to over $2 billion. Things could get worse. Quotes in the article Boeing Co BA ▼ 183.07 -0.32 -0.17% Under the terms of the revised contract with the Air Force, Boeing needs to deliver 18 planes by January of 2018 and 18 refueling pods by October 2018. The U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) issued an updated report on the KC-46A program in March, confirming that the costs and performance targets were being met while the schedule remains a problem.© courtesy of Boeing Co. Leanne Caret, CEO of Boeing's defense, space, and security division, told Aviation Week on Tuesday that she was "not thrilled with where we are today:" [I]t has not been easy or graceful—we are within line of sight to delivering aircraft this year. I am very pleased with the progress the team has made and the fact that we are going to be delivering an amazing, combat-ready tanker to the U.S. Air Force. The GAO is not so sure: GAO's analysis shows there is risk to the current delivery schedule due to potential delays in Federal Aviation Administration certifications and key test events. Boeing must also complete over 1,700 test points on average for each month from February to September 2017, a level that is more than double what it completed in the last 11 months. Program officials agree that there is risk to Boeing's test completion rate until it obtains Federal Aviation Administration approval for the design of all parts, including the pods, but test mitigation strategies are underway.© Provided by 24/7 Wall St. Boeing announced on Wednesday that a sixth KC-46A had entered its test program. The latest addition is the second of a low-rate production lot of seven planes. The Air Force and Boeing have agreed on price and schedule for the first three low-rate production lots totaling 34 aircraft. The total number of new tankers on order is 179 to replace less than half the existing fleet of 59 KC-10 and nearly 400 KC-135 tankers. The KC-135s  average 55 years old and the newer KC-10s average 30 years old. The total value of the contract could exceed $100 billion, including spare parts and other services. Boeing is the third-highest performing stock on the DJIA, up 17.8% year to date, trailing only Apple (up nearly 27.0%) and Visa (up nearly 18.5%). Shares closed nearly flat on Wednesday at $183.39, in a 52-week range of $122.35 to $185.71. The 12-month consensus price target is $188.05.

China is making its boldest attempt yet to break the stranglehold that Airbus SE and Boeing Co. have on the market for big commercial airliners. After years of delays, the nation’s first modern large jet is expected to make its maiden flight. “The C919 will be a game-changer for China’s aerospace industry,” said Corrine Png, chief executive officer of Singapore-based research firm Crucial Perspective. Comac’s C919 passenger plane in Shanghai on April 16. Source: AFP via Getty Images The 158-174 seat C919 is made by state-owned Commercial Aircraft Corp. of China Ltd. and follows Comac’s development of a smaller, regional jet, the ARJ21, that was flown by a Chinese airline for the first time last year. The C919 brings Comac to the table in one of the most lucrative sectors of commercial aviation, competing head-to-head with Boeing’s ubiquitous 737 and Airbus’s A320. The C919’s first flight is set for about 2:00 p.m. local time in Shanghai, a Comac spokesman said. Flights at Pudong between 1:00 p.m. and 3:30 p.m. may be delayed due to the new jetliner’s maiden trip. Behind the celebrations of a Made-in-China jet is the reality that Comac was able to build its new plane using a string of Western suppliers. At least 15 foreign partners such as General Electric Co., Safran SA and Honeywell International Inc. worked on components and systems of the C919. “Comac has really leaned on the experience of its suppliers,” said Tom Szlosek, chief financial officer at Honeywell. “We’re adding a lot of value.” Tapping into the supply chains of Airbus and Boeing allows Comac to bypass many of the technical challenges of making a modern commercial jet from scratch and builds up the company’s expertise for future designs. “It’s impractical for Comac not to take advantage of technologies that are already out there,” said Yu Zhanfu, a principal at Roland Berger Strategy Consultants in Beijing. “If you insist on doing everything from the ground up by yourself, chances are you will become irrelevant.” Companies based outside China supply C919 systems for flight control, power, lighting, cockpit control and much else. The engines and landing gear are from overseas manufacturers. The Chinese jet demonstrates the extent globalization has taken over the manufacture of major engineering products. Just as the jet relies on systems from firms based around the world, many of those systems are built with components that originated in China. A mock cockpit of a Comac C919. Photographer: Johannes Eisele/AFP via Getty Images The C919’s engines for example are made by CFM. CFM’s parents, GE and French manufacturer Safran Aircraft Engines, in turn buy more than $500 million of Chinese-made parts a year for the company’s single-aisle jet engine series, the company said. A China-designed aircraft doesn’t mean all the parts have to be made by the Chinese, said Bao Pengli, a project manager for the C919 at Comac. Some of the equipment are sourced from international suppliers to meet Comac’s standards and they not only supply Comac, but also other airplane makers around the world, he said. China’s approach is almost the opposite of the strategy followed by Japan when it was at a similar level of development. There, Japan’s aerospace companies became suppliers to Boeing, and more recently Airbus, and now make as much as 35 percent of the Boeing 787’s airframe, according to Boeing Japan. China’s decision to build its own large jet with overseas help is one reason the C919’s specifications are similar to the 737 Max and A320, said Michel Merluzeau, director of aerospace and defense market analysis for AirInsightResearch in Seattle. It should also help Comac ensure the plane is a success. Of 15 non-Chinese suppliers contacted by Bloomberg about their involvement with the C919, eight -- FACC AG, Honeywell, Parker Aerospace, UTC Aerospace Systems, Arconic, Liebherr-Aerospace, Eaton and CFM International -- responded. All expressed confidence in the new aircraft and the potential for further collaboration in China. Workers assemble a Comac C919. Source: VCG via Getty Images While the emergence of a Chinese jet brings new revenue for component suppliers, it turns up the heat on the world’s two biggest planemakers in a key market for growth. Will ‘Made in China’ Threaten Boeing and Airbus?: QuickTake Q&A Boeing predicted in September that China will need over 6,800 aircraft valued at more than $1 trillion in the two decades through 2035, and three-fourths of them will be single-aisle planes. The country’s largest carrier, China Southern Airlines Co., and its units have ordered more than $15 billion of new aircraft from Airbus and Boeing since 2015. Boeing, which plans to build a facility in China, said it congratulated Comac on the development of the C919. Airbus already assembles A320s at a plant in Tianjin and said the competition would be good for the industry. U.S. labor unions aren’t so sure. “We have been sending out the alarm bells for many years now about China’s growing aerospace industry,” said Owen Herrnstadt, director of trade and globalization for the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers. “They’ve pitted Western aerospace companies against one another.” Fabrice Bregier, who runs Airbus’s jetliner arm, said at an airshow last year he expects the Chinese to become serious competitors but it would be well into the next decade before they had the range of aircraft and support network to be a global player. “The real challenge for the Chinese is not to design and operate and fly an aircraft” in the C919 category, said AirInsight’s Merluzeau. “The real challenge is how they are going to be able to demonstrate to the customer outside of China that they can support and service the aircraft.” Passenger seats inside a full scale model of a Comac C919. Photographer: Chris Ratcliffe/Bloomberg Within China, though, Comac will benefit from strong government support, according to George Ferguson, a Bloomberg Intelligence analyst who estimates the country has committed as much as $7 billion to the program. “At some point, the government is going to say to the airlines: ’You need to buy these airplanes.”’ That support is one reason China’s attempt to build big jets is faring better than efforts in Japan and Brazil, according to a March report by RAND Corp. The report said China was “absorbing losses that would dissuade new market entrants operating on a purely private-enterprise basis.” Few doubt China’s determination to build its expertise. Comac is already working with Russia’s United Aircraft Corp. to develop a bigger, twin-aisle airliner, dubbed the C929, that would compete with the 787 and A330 models. “They’re serious about learning how to produce parts -- and producing high quality aircraft parts,” said Jeegar Kakkad, chief economist and director of policy for ADS Group, the London-based trade association representing aerospace companies in the U.K. “There is a huge learning curve for them.” — With assistance by Bruce Einhorn, and Dong Lyu Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

IranAir’s plan to buy more than 180 jets from Airbus and Boeing is the most visible economic deal on the table after major powers last year lifted most sanctions on Iran in return for restrictions on its nuclear activities.  But financing for the purchases has been hard to secure because most Western banks are holding back, concerned about the future of the 2015 agreement after US President Donald Trump called it a bad deal and ordered a review. So far, IranAir has taken delivery of just three Airbus jets, for which it paid cash, industry sources say.  Deputy Roads and Urban Development Minister Asghar Fakhrieh-Kashan said the UK’s export credit arm, UK Export Finance (UKEF), had tentatively offered support for least some Airbus jets built in Britain, France, Germany and Spain. It could also offer some support to Airbus’s US rival, Boeing, he added. “We have received some offers from UKEF, that is under review by Iran,” Fakhrieh-Kashan told Reuters. Two aircraft industry sources who asked not to be named also confirmed talks were taking place. UKEF and both major planemakers declined to comment. Countries in parts of the world where banks won’t invest often turn to European and US governments for export credits or loan insurance when they want to buy big-ticket items like aircraft from those countries’ companies. About 6 percent of aircraft deliveries depend on such support, which removes some but not all of the risks banks face in lending to airlines with poor credit, helping to grease the wheels of trade. This fallback system has been frozen for more than a year, however, as European agencies demand more controls after Airbus acknowledged making faulty applications for UK aid, triggering a fraud probe, and UKEF’s equivalent in Washington, the Export-Import Bank (EXIM), faced a battle over its future. US President Donald Trump hinted in his campaign he might get rid of the EXIM Bank, which some conservative members of Congress have argued perpetuates cronyism. He has since talked up the benefits of exports for US jobs and in April nominated a new bank president and a member of the board. Iran and UK elections Speeding up aircraft deliveries is seen as a priority for Tehran as President Hassan Rouhani’s government seeks to show results from the sanctions deal ahead of elections on May 19. Iran says the prospect of buying Western jets to renew its decaying fleet was built into the 2015 nuclear deal and that any barriers to completing the purchases would undermine the accord. On the UK side, Prime Minister Theresa May’s recent decision to hold a snap election in early June means any new funding deal is unlikely to be finalised before then. UK government agencies like UKEF avoid major new initiatives during campaigning and a deal involving a topic as sensitive as trade with Iran would need approval before it could go ahead. Airbus said last week on an investors’ call that it hoped to receive some support from European export financing agencies this year. But a source familiar with the process said it remained unclear how quickly UKEF would lift a temporary ban on Airbus funding as the UK and French fraud investigation continues. If UKEF provides support for Boeing deliveries, it would not be the first time, but it would be rare. The main proviso is that a certain proportion of parts in each jet need to be made in Britain – usually 20 percent. For Boeing exports, that would typically mean the jets would have to have Rolls-Royce engines. The Boeing planes ordered by Iran all have engines made by US supplier General Electric or GE and its French partner Safran. UKEF has said in the past it recognizes the need to be flexible on foreign content in view of global supply chains.  People who have dealt with the agency before say it may be able to consider equipment bought by Boeing from British companies. – Reuters This article was published on 04/05/2017 Most Read Our precious sea Egyptian woman leaves Indian hospital more than 300 kg lighter All we want is glowing skin!

Weeks after the abrupt ouster of its Chairman and Chief Executive Klaus Kleinfeld over a bizarre letter he wrote to Elliott’s founder, the aerospace and automotive parts maker ARNC, -0.60%  has named former Boeing Co. BA, -0.17%  executive James F. Albaugh and Air Force retired General Janet C. Wolfenbarger to its board. Those additions bring to three its number of new directors since the fight started in January. Don’t miss: Opinion: How to make millions on a losing stock? Ask Klaus Kleinfeld. As part of the move, Ratan Tata, of the famed Indian conglomerate family, will be stepping down, keeping Arconic’s board at 13 members. The annual meeting is now scheduled for May 25. Elliott is running a slate of four nominees and has argued forcefully the board needs turnover, even after the exit of Kleinfeld, whose leadership had taken the brunt of their criticism. Elliott last week took aim at the board’s judgment for its handling of Kleinfeld. An expanded version of this report appears at WSJ.com.

Weeks after the abrupt ouster of its Chairman and Chief Executive Klaus Kleinfeld over a bizarre letter he wrote to Elliott’s founder, the aerospace and automotive parts maker ARNC, -0.60%  has named former Boeing Co. BA, -0.17%  executive James F. Albaugh and Air Force retired General Janet C. Wolfenbarger to its board. Those additions bring to three its number of new directors since the fight started in January. Don’t miss: Opinion: How to make millions on a losing stock? Ask Klaus Kleinfeld. As part of the move, Ratan Tata, of the famed Indian conglomerate family, will be stepping down, keeping Arconic’s board at 13 members. The annual meeting is now scheduled for May 25. Elliott is running a slate of four nominees and has argued forcefully the board needs turnover, even after the exit of Kleinfeld, whose leadership had taken the brunt of their criticism. Elliott last week took aim at the board’s judgment for its handling of Kleinfeld. An expanded version of this report appears at WSJ.com.

(NYSE: BA) reported fourth-quarter 2016 earnings in January, the company announced a $201 million charge to the KC-46A tanker program. That brought the total cost overruns on the U.S. Air Force’s new tanker to over $2 billion. Things could get worse. Under the terms of the revised contract with the Air Force, Boeing needs to deliver 18 planes by January of 2018 and 18 refueling pods by October 2018. The U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) issued an updated report on the KC-46A program in March, confirming that the costs and performance targets were being met while the schedule remains a problem. Leanne Caret, CEO of Boeing’s defense, space, and security division, told Aviation Week on Tuesday that she was “not thrilled with where we are today:” [I]t has not been easy or graceful—we are within line of sight to delivering aircraft this year. I am very pleased with the progress the team has made and the fact that we are going to be delivering an amazing, combat-ready tanker to the U.S. Air Force. The GAO is not so sure: GAO’s analysis shows there is risk to the current delivery schedule due to potential delays in Federal Aviation Administration certifications and key test events. Boeing must also complete over 1,700 test points on average for each month from February to September 2017, a level that is more than double what it completed in the last 11 months. Program officials agree that there is risk to Boeing’s test completion rate until it obtains Federal Aviation Administration approval for the design of all parts, including the pods, but test mitigation strategies are underway. Source: U.S. Government Accountability Office Boeing announced on Wednesday that a sixth KC-46A had entered its test program. The latest addition is the second of a low-rate production lot of seven planes. The Air Force and Boeing have agreed on price and schedule for the first three low-rate production lots totaling 34 aircraft. The total number of new tankers on order is 179 to replace less than half the existing fleet of 59 KC-10 and nearly 400 KC-135 tankers. The KC-135s  average 55 years old and the newer KC-10s average 30 years old. The total value of the contract could exceed $100 billion, including spare parts and other services. Boeing is the third-highest performing stock on the DJIA, up 17.8% year to date, trailing only Apple (up nearly 27.0%) and Visa (up nearly 18.5%). Shares closed nearly flat on Wednesday at $183.39, in a 52-week range of $122.35 to $185.71. The 12-month consensus price target is $188.05.

B777-300ER aircraft operated by American Airlines Group Inc. stands inside the Qantas Airways Ltd. hangar at Sydney Airport in Sydney, Australia, on Friday, Nov. 13, 2015. American Airlines in December will start daily flights between Sydney and Los Angeles, allowing Qantas at the same time to reopen a route from Sydney to San Francisco. Photographer: Brendon Thorne/BloombergMore American Airlines Group Inc. is about to give coach passengers even less legroom. The company will shrink the space between most rows to 30 inches (76 centimeters) on its newest Boeing Co. 737 jetliners, spokesman Joshua Freed said Wednesday. That’s an inch less than on its existing 737-800 planes. At least three rows on the new 737 Max jets will have only 29 inches, moving the world’s largest carrier closer to the offerings of deep discounters such as Spirit Airlines Inc. and Frontier Airlines. American’s effort marks the latest push by U.S. airlines to cram more passengers onto each plane by using new, slimmer seat designs that are supposed to maximize room for a passenger’s knees even as rows move closer together. America’s newest contribution to the so-called densification trend will begin in the third quarter when the carrier takes delivery of its first 737 Max planes. More from Bloomberg.com: Provocateur-in-Chief Trump Pokes His Own Party’s Power Centers “These are well-designed seats built for this kind of a layout,” Freed said in an interview. “We believe we’re still providing a good product for customers.” He declined to identify which rows will have the least legroom. The Max will have 172 total seats, including 36 in Main Cabin Extra, a higher-priced option with more leg room than the rest of the coach section. American will receive four of the narrow-body 737 Max planes this year and 16 in 2018. It has 100 on order with Boeing. Challenging Discounters The change may signal that American is ready to challenge the super-discount airlines for customers rather than battle with Delta Air Lines Inc. in particular over business travelers, said Alan Bender of Embry Riddle Aeronautical University. Having more seats means American can sell more lower-priced tickets. More from Bloomberg.com: JPMorgan to Move Hundreds of Staff to Three EU Offices on Brexit “They may be choosing to play hardball with the ultra-low-cost carriers,” Bender said in an interview. “If you’re not getting extra revenue from business fliers, you have to get more money from people flying in economy, and you can’t get more from people flying in economy unless you put in more seats.” American is considering similar changes for any new 737-800 planes, Freed said. The airline raised the seat count on its 737-800s to 160 from 150 starting in 2015. It also had increased seats on its wide-body 777-200 jets to 289 from 247. More from Bloomberg.com: Is This the Most Valuable Car in the World? “Just like every airline, with every new plane you look to have an efficient layout that makes use of the space on board and provides customers a good product,” he said. “There is some variability today on many fleets within coach cabins at our airline and others.” Cabin Spaces The Max will retain a first-class cabin with 16 seats. The spots with less pitch -- or the distance from the back of one seat to the same spot on the one in front of it -- won’t be part of American’s Basic Economy fare, which comes at a lower price but with no extra frills. The changes may also further split coach passengers from those flying in business or first class, Bender said.  “The extremes are becoming more extreme” in air travel, he said. “I would believe those who are willing to pay a premium are going to get enhanced service.” Southwest Airlines Co. took advantage of new slimmer designs to add six seats to most of its 737s as part of a cabin refurbishing in 2012, and Delta took similar steps three years ago. CNN earlier reported American’s plans to reduce the space between rows on the 737 Max. Updates to add number of Max seats in fifth paragraph.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 4 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Arconic’s Board of Directors Urges Shareholders to Choose Strong Arconic Governance over Questionable Elliott Tactics NEW YORK–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Arconic (NYSE: ARNC) today issued a letter to shareholders explaining why they should choose the Company’s strong governance and outstanding director slate dedicated to serving shareholder interests over Elliott’s questionable tactics. In a separate release also issued today, the Company announced its nomination of former Boeing Commercial Airplanes President and Chief Executive Officer James “Jim” F. Albaugh and Air Force retired General Janet Wolfenbarger for election to Arconic’s Board of Directors at the Company’s 2017 Annual Meeting. Mr. Albaugh and General Wolfenbarger will stand for election with current directors David Hess, Amy Alving and Ulrich Schmidt. Additional information, including the letter to shareholders, investor presentation and supplemental proxy materials are available at www.arconic.com/annualmeeting. The Company urges shareholders to vote “FOR” the Company’s new slate of five director nominees and governance proposals on the WHITE proxy card. The full text of the letter follows: Dear Fellow Shareholders: We are writing to ask you to vote for the slate of directors nominated by the Arconic Board of Directors at the upcoming 2017 Annual Meeting of Shareholders. Our director candidates are all accomplished professionals who will help guide Arconic as it recruits a permanent Chief Executive Officer and builds upon its strong first quarter 2017 financial results. Three of our nominees are current Board members (none having served for more than 16 months), and two are entirely new nominees who have not yet served on Arconic’s Board. One commitment, though, binds them together: an unwavering dedication to shareholder interests. We recently made several attempts to settle the disruptive proxy contest started by Elliott Management (“Elliott”). Despite our best efforts, we were unsuccessful. Elliott agreed to end the fight on terms both sides indicated were acceptable. Then Elliott reneged. We resumed discussions and then Elliott agreed again, though on different terms. Elliott then reneged. Again. We tried, nevertheless, to end the battle by offering two Board seats to the candidates Elliott has nominated. Notably, and reflecting Elliott’s pervasive influence over its nominees, none of Elliott’s director candidates accepted our offer. An outstanding director slate, dedicated to serving your interests We have now recruited two exceptional new director nominees for the Board who are purely independent. They join our slate alongside three current Board members – our Interim CEO, the head of our Audit Committee and the head of our Cybersecurity Subcommittee. Together, these five nominees bring decades of experience in aerospace and defense. We hope you will join us in voting for them. Our new nominees are: James “Jim” F. Albaugh, an internationally recognized aerospace executive who was the President and Chief Executive Officer of Boeing Commercial Airplanes until his retirement in 2012. Prior to that role, Mr. Albaugh was President and CEO of Boeing Integrated Defense Systems and President of Rocketdyne Propulsion and Power. Mr. Albaugh is the Chairman of the National Aeronautic Association, past Chairman of the Aerospace Industries Association and serves on the Boards of American Airlines and Harris Corporation. He holds a Master’s degree in Civil Engineering from Columbia University and is an elected member of the National Academy of Engineering. The aerospace segment represents close to half of Arconic’s overall revenue today and has significant prospects for the future. Mr. Albaugh brings a deep understanding of the aerospace segment’s needs. Janet C. Wolfenbarger, a retired four-star general who was responsible for procurement, science and technology, test and evaluation, logistics and supply chain for the U.S. Air Force; she oversaw an approximately $60 billion annual budget, including a large portion of the approximately $1 billion of business that Arconic does in the defense industry. In her last military role, General Wolfenbarger oversaw an organization of 80,000 people and led significant restructuring of the Air Force Materiel Command to improve efficiency. General Wolfenbarger was the first female four-star general in Air Force history. Among her many accomplishments, General Wolfenbarger holds a Master’s degree in Aeronautics and Astronautics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Both of these new nominees know Arconic from having served as respected leaders at important Arconic customers. They bring operating experience and commercial insights that we believe will help optimize the Company and its strategy for many years. We are confident that these two nominees, like our other nominees, are independent and objective and seeking only to serve Arconic using their best judgment and insights from decades of relevant experience. The reality is that regardless of who wins this proxy fight, there will be change in the Board, and there will be new perspectives. Our slate of nominees has five new directors: two who have never served on our Board, two who have served for fewer than seven months and one who was originally nominated by Elliott and who joined the Board just last year. So, your choice at this meeting is not really about “change” or “no change.” The most important decision this Board will make in the coming months is the selection of a new CEO. Arconic’s recommended Board is without question best placed to select the next CEO, given its deep industry expertise and view of the marketplace. Your choice is about some important principles and some critical people. Strong governance over questionable tactics Elliott has had three primary goals during its campaign: Remove the sitting CEO and steer the selection of his replacement; Shape a majority of the Arconic Board; and Dictate the direction of key Board decisions and processes. Since Arconic’s CEO stepped down, Elliott has shifted its attacks to the Board level with increasingly personal attacks on directors and hyperbolic assertions that the Board is weak on governance. Elliott’s latest attack theme – “subversion of shareholder democracy” – is ironically being deployed in an effort to enable one 13.2% shareholder to shape a majority of the Board. If successful, Elliott will have nominated seven of Arconic’s 13 directors. A weak-governance Board would have ended this fight to spare itself Elliott’s unfair attacks. We could have agreed, via settlement, to Elliott’s over-reaching demands, including its insistence on appointing a majority of both an Operating Committee and the CEO Search Committee. But Arconic’s Board has refused to allow one shareholder these unilateral rights; instead we are focused on full shareholder representation and participation. For our part, we believe public companies should be run for all shareholders and should be governed ethically. We also believe that: In the public markets, no single minority investor should have the right to shape a majority of the Board, select a CEO, or unilaterally define how a Board organizes itself and operates; Hedge funds should not have free reign to level false or unsubstantiated accusations with the aim of embarrassing, ruining or damaging people. We believe that a vote on Elliott’s proxy card is a vote of encouragement for activists who demand undue influence as Elliott has clearly demanded at Arconic, and for activists to use tactics of personal destruction as their means. The right kind of change to keep Arconic on a strong path Your choice at the 2017 Annual Meeting is between two sets of directors – both essentially new to Arconic. Shareholders should ask themselves – which set is most qualified to be stewards of their investment and this Company? We believe that our nominees – including Mr. Albaugh and retired General Wolfenbarger – bring substantially more relevant expertise to the Board than those nominated by Elliott. We welcome your thoughtful evaluation of the two director slates. Our nominees also include: David Hess. Mr. Hess has more than 38 years of operational and leadership experience in aerospace and deep knowledge of jet engine technology and manufacturing. As our interim CEO, Mr. Hess has been a stabilizing force at Arconic during a time of leadership transition. We do not believe that shareholders should reject his candidacy at this critical time. Amy Alving. Dr. Alving is a leading expert on aerospace innovation and engineering, as well as cybersecurity, and is the Chair of Arconic’s Cybersecurity Advisory Subcommittee. Although she has been on the Board just six months, her contributions in these areas have been very substantial. As part of enterprise risk management, Arconic is highly focused on improving its cyber-security fluency; Dr. Alving’s deep expertise directly addresses this core need. Ulrich Schmidt. Mr. Schmidt has over 22 years of aerospace and financial experience. He was one of the three directors nominated by Elliott to join the Board last February and serves as Chair of the Audit Committee, in addition to serving on the Governance and Nominating Committee and Finance Committee. Our Board believes in responsible, thoughtful change targeted to create sustainable shareholder value. We have been willing to shed businesses, acquire others, split the company to create two independent firms and make a swift and decisive change in leadership. We have augmented our Board, modified our strategies and redesigned our compensation plans. So, this election is not about whether Arconic should stand still or change. We will continue to evolve and change. In fact, Arconic’s proposed Board includes nine directors who will have joined in just the last 16 months, making it one of the shortest tenured Boards in the S&P 500. A strong first quarter as an independent Company, on track to create shareholder value We are proud that Arconic is positioned well for the future. Last week, we announced strong earnings for the first quarter of 2017 – our first full quarter as a standalone company. Revenue was up 4.5% year over year, and strong performance and continued cost savings allowed Arconic to deliver net income that exceeded expectations. Our earnings announcement is a strong first data point that we are on the right path after the highly complex separation transaction that the Company executed this past November. Significant shareholder value has been created in just the first few months since the separation was completed. Arconic has a clear strategy to harness innovation, control costs and deepen our close customer relationships to generate value for shareholders. Our customers agree: Airbus, Boeing, United Technologies and GE Aviation have all expressed support for the strategy Arconic’s Board has endorsed. To keep the business healthy and build sustainable shareholder value, we need to ensure we continue to execute the right strategy, appoint a permanent CEO who will focus on value creation, and not compromise on sound governance. To do these things, we need your support and your vote. Please vote for the principles and people that will create the best Arconic for shareholders. Vote on the White card for the Board’s recommended nominees. Unanimously, The Board of Directors of Arconic Inc.   VOTE USING THE WHITE PROXY CARD. The Arconic Annual Meeting of Shareholders will take place on May 25, 2017 at 9:00 a.m. in Purchase, New York.

The Boeing company will deliver 4 P-8I planes to India under the deal as New Delhi looks to counter China in the Indian Ocean. “The deal has been signed. The delivery dates are being worked out,” a defence ministry source told AFP, adding that the deal was worth more than a billion dollars. According to the paper, ndia has already deployed its original eight long-range P-8I aircraft to track submarine movements in the Indian Ocean. The navy is looking to beef up its fleet to strengthen its capabilities against submarines and surface ships. “India has a vast maritime border and these planes are meant for long-range surveillance,” a Boeing official told AFP, adding that a clause in the earlier agreement provided for New Delhi to purchase four more planes. “The navy will likely deploy them in the Indian Ocean and Bay of Bengal to counter Chinese influence in the seas,” the official said.

India is considered as the world’s number one defene importer and the country is in the midst of a multi-billion dollar upgrade of its Soviet-era military hardware.

Other deals have been mired in bureaucratic wrangles, however, notably the agreement to buy 36 Rafale fighter jets from France’s Dassault Aviation which has been pending since 2012.

Alan Diaz, / AP American Airlines shrinks legroom on new 737 jetliners May 4, 2017 Updated: May 4, 2017 02:55 PM Related US airline ban on electronics is misguided United left to rue removal of passenger with its reputation now anything but ‘friendly’ American Airlines ups outlook as rival United’s passenger scandal bites American Airlines buys stake in China’s biggest state-owned carrier Related US airline ban on electronics is misguided United left to rue removal of passenger with its reputation now anything but ‘friendly’ American Airlines ups outlook as rival United’s passenger scandal bites American Airlines buys stake in China’s biggest state-owned carrier Taller flyers might want to think twice about booking an American Airlines ticket – the US carrier is about to give economy passengers even less legroom. The company will shrink the space between most rows to 30 inches (76 centimetres) on its newest Boeing 737 jetliners, its spokesman Joshua Freed said. That’s an inch less than on its existing 737-800 planes. At least three rows on the new 737 MAX jets will have only 29 inches, moving the world’s largest carrier closer to the offerings of deep discounters such as Spirit Airlines Inc. and Frontier Airlines. American’s effort marks the latest push by US airlines to cram more passengers on to each plane by using new, slimmer seat designs that are supposed to maximise room for a passenger’s knees even as rows move closer together. America’s newest contribution to the so-called densification trend will begin in the third quarter when the carrier takes delivery of its first 737 MAX planes. "These are well-designed seats built for this kind of a layout," Mr Freed said. "We believe we’re still providing a good product for customers." He declined to identify which rows will have the least legroom. The MAX will have 172 total seats, including 36 in Main Cabin Extra, a higher-priced option with more leg room than the rest of the coach section. American will receive four of the narrow-body 737 MAX planes this year and 16 in 2018. It has 100 on order with Boeing. The change may signal that American is ready to challenge the super-discount airlines for customers rather than battle with Delta Air Lines in particular over business travellers, said Alan Bender of Embry Riddle Aeronautical University. Having more seats means American can sell more lower-priced tickets. "They may be choosing to play hardball with the ultra-low-cost carriers," Mr Bender said. "If you’re not getting extra revenue from business fliers, you have to get more money from people flying in economy, and you can’t get more from people flying in economy unless you put in more seats." American is considering similar changes for any new 737-800 planes, Mr Freed said. The airline raised the seat count on its 737-800s to 160 from 150 starting in 2015. It also had increased seats on its wide-body 777-200 jets to 289 from 247. "Just like every airline, with every new plane you look to have an efficient layout that makes use of the space on board and provides customers a good product," he said. "There is some variability today on many fleets within coach cabins at our airline and others." The MAX will retain a first-class cabin with 16 seats. The spots with less pitch – or the distance from the back of one seat to the same spot on the one in front of it – will not be part of American’s Basic Economy fare, which comes at a lower price but with no extra frills. The changes may also further split coach passengers from those flying in business or first class, Mr Bender said. "The extremes are becoming more extreme" in air travel, he said. "I would believe those who are willing to pay a premium are going to get enhanced service." Southwest Airlines took advantage of new slimmer designs to add six seats to most of its 737s as part of a cabin refurbishing in 2012, and Delta took similar steps three years ago. * Bloomberg Pages: Add your comment View all comments More Aviation Etihad Airways announces new roles for senior Emiratis American Airlines shrinks legroom on new 737 jetliners Air France-KLM losses widen but signs of recovery appear Qantas forecasts second-best annual profit MOST VIEWED Business | All Etihad Airways announces new roles for senior Emiratis Q1 results in the UAE mask less than stellar fundamentals Weak demand and increasing supply hurt prospects for Abu Dhabi property Credit demand in the Emirates up as austerity measures ease Oman Air to buy 15 Dreamliners or A350s Abu Dhabi Motors Rolls-Royce sales move back into the fast lane Arabtec’s wait for quarterly profit ends Jihad Azour: The IMF’s new man for all seasons Hill International chief executive departs Dubai tenant told to pay bills, rent for two apartments at the same time More Most Viewed Burj Khalifa most Instagrammed building in Dubai, survey shows Stephanie McMahon on increasing WWE’s status in the UAE and Triple H’s WrestleMania entrances Hard-working judge at Dubai’s new One Day Court settles 6,000 cases in less than 2 months Saudi Arabia’s patience with Iran is over A new social, economic and political climate emerges in Saudi Arabia Etihad Airways announces new roles for senior Emiratis Former ‘world’s heaviest woman’ arrives in Abu Dhabi for treatment Ed Sheeran to return to UAE with Dubai concert Luxury yachts worth $4m stolen from Dubai used for crime High school fees ‘necessary to attract best teachers’ More Most Viewed Back to the top EDITOR'S PICKS Cheap digs for global billionaires in Dubai The Debt Panel: Dubai travel agent with debts of Dh125,000 fears repercussions of travelling to her sister’s wedding Where Dubai rents have risen and fallen, Q1 2017 – in pictures Where Abu Dhabi rents have risen and fallen, 2016 – in pictures FOLLOW US Tweets by @TheNationalUAE SPOTLIGHT Putin and Erdogan press for ‘de-escalation zones’ in Syria At least 21 killed trying to save workmates trapped in Iran mine Switch to Mobile Site About us Contact us Work with us Privacy policy Terms and conditions Advertise with us Subscribe Sitemap super.ae alittihad.ae thenational.ae anazahra.com ngalarabiya.com adtv.ae adradio.ae admedia.ae

IranAir's plan to buy more than 180 jets from Airbus [AIR.PA] and Boeing (BA.N) is the most visible economic deal on the table after major powers last year lifted most sanctions on Iran in return for restrictions on its nuclear activities. But financing for the purchases has been hard to secure because most Western banks are holding back, concerned about the future of the 2015 agreement after U.S. President Donald Trump called it a bad deal and ordered a review. So far, IranAir has taken delivery of just three Airbus jets, for which it paid cash, industry sources say. Deputy Roads and Urban Development Minister Asghar Fakhrieh-Kashan said the UK's export credit arm, UK Export Finance (UKEF), had tentatively offered support for least some Airbus jets built in Britain, France, Germany and Spain. It could also offer some support to Airbus's U.S. rival, Boeing, he added. "We have received some offers from UKEF, that is under review by Iran," Fakhrieh-Kashan told Reuters. Two aircraft industry sources who asked not to be named also confirmed talks were taking place. UKEF and both major planemakers declined to comment. Countries in parts of the world where banks won't invest often turn to European and U.S. governments for export credits or loan insurance when they want to buy big-ticket items like aircraft from those countries' companies. About 6 percent of aircraft deliveries depend on such support, which removes some but not all of the risks banks face in lending to airlines with poor credit, helping to grease the wheels of trade. This fallback system has been frozen for more than a year, however, as European agencies demand more controls after Airbus acknowledged making faulty applications for UK aid, triggering a fraud probe, and UKEF's equivalent in Washington, the Export-Import Bank (EXIM), faced a battle over its future. U.S. President Donald Trump hinted in his campaign he might get rid of the EXIM Bank, which some conservative members of Congress have argued perpetuates cronyism. He has since talked up the benefits of exports for U.S. jobs and in April nominated a new bank president and a member of the board. IRAN, UK ELECTIONS Speeding up aircraft deliveries is seen as a priority for Tehran as President Hassan Rouhani's government seeks to show results from the sanctions deal ahead of elections on May 19. Iran says the prospect of buying Western jets to renew its decaying fleet was built into the 2015 nuclear deal and that any barriers to completing the purchases would undermine the accord. On the UK side, Prime Minister Theresa May's recent decision to hold a snap election in early June means any new funding deal is unlikely to be finalised before then. UK government agencies like UKEF avoid major new initiatives during campaigning and a deal involving a topic as sensitive as trade with Iran would need approval before it could go ahead. Airbus said last week on an investors' call that it hoped to receive some support from European export financing agencies this year. But a source familiar with the process said it remained unclear how quickly UKEF would lift a temporary ban on Airbus funding as the UK and French fraud investigation continues. If UKEF provides support for Boeing deliveries, it would not be the first time, but it would be rare. The main proviso is that a certain proportion of parts in each jet need to be made in Britain - usually 20 percent. For Boeing exports, that would typically mean the jets would have to have Rolls-Royce (RR.L) engines. The Boeing planes ordered by Iran all have engines made by U.S. supplier General Electric (GE.N) or GE and its French partner Safran (SAF.PA). UKEF has said in the past it recognizes the need to be flexible on foreign content in view of global supply chains. People who have dealt with the agency before say it may be able to consider equipment bought by Boeing from British companies.

Warren / Associated Press) Aerospace blog Suppliers say Boeing plans to accelerate 737 MAX production Dan Catchpole Thu May 4th, 2017 9:46am BusinessNews You must sign in or register to continue reading content. RENTON — In the next two years, the Boeing Co. plans to go from making about one 737 MAX a month to more than 50 a month. No company has ever turned up production of a new jetliner that quickly. And Boeing has a lot riding on successfully pulling off the feat. Company leaders are counting on the jump in 737 production to bolster Boeing’s bottom line over the next few years as profits drop on its 777 program. So far, introducing the MAX has been smooth, and Boeing expects to hand over the first 737 MAX to launch customer Norwegian in May. The airplane maker says it has put time and money into ensuring plans stay on track. Still, it is early in the program, caution analysts. Introducing a new jetliner while cranking up production rate is like a daredevil “walking between the wings of an airplane at fairly high altitude and high speed,” said Richard Aboulafia, an aerospace analyst and vice president of the Teal Group in Washington, D.C. The last time Boeing revamped its 737 models, supply chain problems forced it to temporarily shut down production in the fall of 1997 and cost the company about $1 billion. The first big jump in production rate is coming in June, when Boeing’s Renton plant will go from making about 1.5 737 MAXes a month to 10.5, according to several suppliers. At the same time, Boeing plans to increase overall 737 production — including MAX and Next Gen versions — from 42 a month now to 47. The increase in output means work for Boeing employees in Renton and Everett — where stow bins and other interior items are assembled — as well as for suppliers around Snohomish County. All 737 airplanes are assembled in Renton. Boeing declined to comment on specific production plans, typically a closely guarded secret by airplane makers. However, speaking to several suppliers, The Daily Herald pieced together the company’s tentative production schedule for the 737 program. None of the suppliers is approved to publicly discuss the information and could face retribution for doing so. They agreed to speak only if they are not named. Based on tentative schedules Boeing has given to suppliers interviewed by The Herald, MAX output is scheduled to increase every few months over the next few years. At the same time, the company plans to wind down Next Gen production. Production of all 737 versions is slated to increase to 52.5 airplanes a month in January 2018 and to 57 a month around April 2019, the suppliers said. Those increases are driven by Boeing’s plan to crank out MAX airplanes and make fewer of the current Next Gen models. Boeing plans to step up MAX output to 17 airplanes a month later this year and to 24 a month around April 2018. Production is slated to pick up that summer to 31.5 a month and then to 42 a month around the end of 2018. The final increase to 52.5 a month is slated for around March 2019, the suppliers said. So far, Boeing has made a handful of the 737 MAX 8, the first of the upgraded versions. Four of the aircraft have been used for flight tests. In March, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration certified the MAX 8 for commercial service, and the first MAX 9 — a stretch of the MAX 8 — rolled out of Boeing’s Renton plant. The test aircraft already are either back in the Renton plant or will return for tweaks and improvements. The work is a standard part of the test phase during development. It includes improvements to the airplanes’ CFM Leap 1b engines. In addition to new engines, the MAX airplanes also include new avionics and modified winglets, among other changes over current production versions, a group dubbed 737 Next Generation models. The company relies heavily on the popular single-aisle airplanes for revenue. The equity investment firm RBC estimates that the 737 program made up about 35 percent of operating profit for Boeing Commercial Aircraft in 2015. The twin-aisle 777 brought in about as much profit that year, according to RBC. For more than a decade, the 777 program has been a spigot of cash for Boeing. Now, that is going away as Boeing winds down 777 production and starts making its successor, the 777X in Everett. Company leaders are counting on 737 production to make up much of the drop in 777 profits. The pace in the Renton plant is picking up, though. And if all goes to Boeing’s plans, it will accelerate at dizzying speeds over the next couple of years. Some suppliers already are delivering parts at higher rates. Production delays plagued the 787 and the 747-8 programs. Boeing learned painful and costly lessons from its production problems in 1997. Those lessons have been applied to current 737 production plans, company spokesman Adam Tischler said. The MAX versions were designed to have as much similarity as possible with the NG models. That limits the number of new suppliers added to the program. The vast majority of MAX suppliers already make 737 parts. Even so, there are potential supply-chain bottlenecks, said Aboulafia, the analyst. In recent years, Boeing has squeezed cost out of its supply chain. That has some suppliers “starved for cash,” which could make it harder to keep up with the increasing 737 production pace, he said. Boeing says it has stress-tested its supply chain and is working with suppliers to limit any delays. Of course, “the ramp up is only as good as the weakest link” in the supply chain, said Scott Hamilton, who runs the aerospace consulting firm Leeham Co. on Bainbridge Island. Even suppliers already on the 737 program face risks, he said. “You have to incorporate changes into production and do it at a record rate.” There is little margin for error, said Tom Brosius, vice president at Orion Industries. The supplier provides parts for all Boeing aircraft programs from its plants in Auburn and Mukilteo. Brosius declined to comment on future 737 production rates. “The 737 is a very unforgiving production line,” he said. “Those planes come out of the plant so fast that you can’t have any delays or any quality problems. You’ve got to bring your A game on the 737 program.” Dan Catchpole: 425-339-3454; dcatchpole@heraldnet.com.

It could also offer some support to Airbus's U.S. rival, Boeing, he added. "We have received some offers from UKEF, that is under review by Iran," Fakhrieh-Kashan told Reuters. Two aircraft industry sources who asked not to be named also confirmed talks were taking place. UKEF and both major planemakers declined to comment. Countries in parts of the world where banks won't invest often turn to European and U.S. governments for export credits or loan insurance when they want to buy big-ticket items like aircraft from those countries' companies. About 6 percent of aircraft deliveries depend on such support, which removes some but not all of the risks banks face in lending to airlines with poor credit, helping to grease the wheels of trade. This fallback system has been frozen for more than a year, however, as European agencies demand more controls after Airbus acknowledged making faulty applications for UK aid, triggering a fraud probe, and UKEF's equivalent in Washington, the Export-Import Bank (EXIM), faced a battle over its future. U.S. President Donald Trump hinted in his campaign he might get rid of the EXIM Bank, which some conservative members of Congress have argued perpetuates cronyism. He has since talked up the benefits of exports for U.S. jobs and in April nominated a new bank president and a member of the board. IRAN, UK ELECTIONS Speeding up aircraft deliveries is seen as a priority for Tehran as President Hassan Rouhani's government seeks to show results from the sanctions deal ahead of elections on May 19. Iran says the prospect of buying Western jets to renew its decaying fleet was built into the 2015 nuclear deal and that any barriers to completing the purchases would undermine the accord. On the UK side, Prime Minister Theresa May's recent decision to hold a snap election in early June means any new funding deal is unlikely to be finalised before then. UK government agencies like UKEF avoid major new initiatives during campaigning and a deal involving a topic as sensitive as trade with Iran would need approval before it could go ahead. Airbus said last week on an investors' call that it hoped to receive some support from European export financing agencies this year. But a source familiar with the process said it remained unclear how quickly UKEF would lift a temporary ban on Airbus funding as the UK and French fraud investigation continues. If UKEF provides support for Boeing deliveries, it would not be the first time, but it would be rare. The main proviso is that a certain proportion of parts in each jet need to be made in Britain - usually 20 percent. For Boeing exports, that would typically mean the jets would have to have Rolls-Royce engines. The Boeing planes ordered by Iran all have engines made by U.S. supplier General Electric or GE and its French partner Safran. UKEF has said in the past it recognises the need to be flexible on foreign content in view of global supply chains. People who have dealt with the agency before say it may be able to consider equipment bought by Boeing from British companies.

Photo Credit: AP advertisement | advertise on newsday American Airlines Group Inc. is about to give coach passengers even less legroom. The company will shrink the space between most rows to 30 inches (76 centimeters) on its newest Boeing 737 jetliners, spokesman Joshua Freed said Wednesday. That’s an inch less than on its existing 737-800 planes. At least three rows on the new 737 Max jets will have only 29 inches, moving the world’s largest carrier closer to the offerings of deep discounters such as Spirit Airlines Inc. and Frontier Airlines. American’s effort marks the latest push by U.S. airlines to cram more passengers onto each plane by taking advantage of new, slimmer seat designs that are supposed to maximize room for a passenger’s knees even as rows move closer together. America’s newest contribution to the so-called densification trend will begin in the third quarter when the carrier takes delivery of its first 737 Max planes. "These are well-designed seats built for this kind of a layout," Freed said in an interview. "We believe we’re still providing a good product for customers." He declined to identify which rows will have the least legroom or how many total seats will be on the Max.  advertisement | advertise on newsday American will receive four of the narrow-body 737 Max planes this year and 16 in 2018. It has 100 on order with Boeing. The airline is considering similar changes for any new 737-800 planes, Freed said.  American raised the seat count on its 737-800s to 160 from 150 starting in 2015. It also had increased seats on its wide-body 777-200 jets to 289 from 247. "Just like every airline, with every new plane you look to have an efficient layout that makes use of the space on board and provides customers a good product," he said. "There is some variability today on many fleets within coach cabins at our airline and others." The Max will retain a first-class cabin with 16 seats, and an unspecified number of Main Cabin Extra seats with added legroom. The spots with less pitch — or the distance from the back of one seat to the same spot on the one in front of it — won’t be part of American’s Basic Economy fare, which comes at a lower price but with no extra frills. Southwest Airlines took advantage of new slimmer designs to add six seats to most of its 737s as part of a cabin refurbishing in 2012, and Delta Air Lines took similar steps three years ago. CNN earlier reported American’s plans to reduce the space between rows on the 737 Max.  american BusinessHow United, other airlines rank for performance, complaints Get the Biz Briefing newsletter!

Eighty-five years later it is still going strong, flying to 75 destinations in the Middle East, Europe, Africa, Asia and the Americas. It has constantly improved its fleet, and is in the process of taking delivery of nine new Boeings — the 737-800 (B738) — which will have their tails painted with a specially commissioned 85th anniversary design rather than Horus, the sky deity the airline normally uses as its logo. Egypt has already received three of the nine new aircraft, increasing EgyptAir’s B738 fleet to 23. “We are proud to celebrate EgyptAir’s 85th anniversary with its loyal employees who have built the African and Middle East’s leading airline,” said Safwat Musallam, chairman and CEO of EgyptAir Holding Company. “We start our 85th anniversary by renovating the fleet through buying nine new Boeing aircraft with the latest onboard services,” Musallam told Al-Ahram Weekly. Three have already been delivered and the remaining craft will arrive this year, with the final plane scheduled to go into service in December. The new aircraft passenger cabin has wider seats, larger overhead lockers and curved ceiling panels. “The newly acquired planes consume lead fuel, a saving that we will be able to pass on to our customers in lower ticket prices,” said Musallam. Flying high The Boeings will serve European routes, and will be supplemented next year by 35 B738 aircraft the last one of which is due to be delivered in 2021. To mark its birthday EgyptAir is publishing a book relating the history of the company. The volume will include an image of the company’s royal charter signed by King Fouad in 1932 as well as photographs of prominent figures who have travelled onboard its planes. “EgyptAir has a very loyal customer base which helps us compete in a crowded market,” says Musallam. “It is a market that is distorted by the fact that some national carriers are massively subsidised, yet EgyptAir still manages to compete internationally and on domestic routes.” Musallam explained that EgyptAir has recently implemented a process of streamlining, cutting costs without compromising service, safety or employees’ salaries. “We did not cancel any routes as part of the streamlining exercise apart from to and from Japan and we did that because following the 2011 Revolution the Japanese market collapsed for us. It’s slowly reviving so last month we started flying to Japan again, once a week.” China is another story altogether. Traffic, both business and tourism, has increased steadily for the last six years and is still growing. But shouldn’t EgyptAir also operate charter flights to countries where it does not have scheduled services in a bid to boost the tourism industry? “Air Cairo, the subsidiary company of EgyptAir, does operate charter flights on demand,” points out Musallam. And how did the floatation of the Egyptian pound affect business? “The floatation was essential to boost Egypt’s economy but like any policy it has advantages and disadvantages,” Musallam told the Weekly. Three of the nine companies that fall under the umbrella of the EgyptAir Holding Companies have been adversely affected by the floatation while four others — the Egypt Free Shops Company (duty-free), Supplementary Industries, the Ground Services and the Maintenance and Engineering Companies have gained because they sell products priced in US dollars. The airline, which is the core of EgyptAir Holding Company’s business, has been affected in two ways. Operation costs have increased because 85 per cent of them are priced in US dollars, and customers have found their own purchasing power decreasing. Now, says Musallam, local customers think twice before travelling, even though ticket prices have not been raised in line with the devaluation of the Egyptian pound. The floatation has also had an impact on the company’s balance sheet as debt servicing of loans denominated in dollars has increased. “EgyptAir Express, the subsidiary company in charge of domestic and regional routes loses out because of low ticket prices. But there is a limit to any price increase that the domestic market can bear. Flight operation costs have tripled, but this doesn’t mean we can triple ticket prices. EgyptAir, after all, is a national company, and we have to provide services at a price that is acceptable to Egyptians.” “Our ticket prices are often below those offered by other international airlines.” This year, says Musallam, the company introduced new pricing structures that reflect whether a customer is carrying luggage or not. search keywords "Flying high" "Safwat Musallam" "CEO" "EgyptAir Ho add comment Email Email is RequiredWrong Email Name Name is Required Comment's Title Comment's Title is Required Comment

Through participatory and immersive experiences, the Center will tell Barack and Michelle Obama’s story, while lifting the hood on the mechanics of change and inspiring visitors to spark their own. You don’t lift the hood on mechanics. You lift the hood on a car, and mechanics work under that hood. And are users really going to “spark their own” “mechanics of change”? Will the mechanics be bending over when they get sparked? Honestly, the whole site is full of hollow-sounding, Orwellian deadness, and the projects is obviously going to suck up a great deal of money (for Google VR to handle those “participatory and immersive experiences,” for example). Ka-ching. “This evening, Obama discusses his Center and his two-terms in the White House in a closed-to-the press dinner before Chicago’s wealthy and civic elite, the Civic Committee of the Commercial Club of Chicago” [Chicago Sun-Times]. “The dinner will take place at The Chicago Club, 81 E.

Readers, this is perhaps the time to explain that last night I had a dream, and this was my dream: I was speaking to Hillary Clinton — she was wearing a tweedy, Chanel-style heather-colored jacket — and told her that while I supported her in 2008 (true!), “I don’t think you should run in 2020.” Although she said nothing, her face froze; her body language was very, very negative. The bright side is that now I can file all the Clinton stories under 2020. “I Tattooed Chelsea Clinton’s Face on My Body and I Regret Nothing” [Vice]. 2016 Post Mortem “The first thing I remember feeling about the 2016 US election was a kind of speechlessness. On 9 November, no one had any idea what to say in the bars and pubs in New York. Conversations could take place only in the form of mutual interrogation. No one had any declarative sentences to offer. The only consensus was that no one knew what happened” [Guardian]. “That consensus is now gone – every woman on the street can riff on the Russians, James Comey and the creaky electoral system – but the anxiety remains. The engine of all argument right now is a very bitter sort of fear we felt right after the whole thing blew up.” “We”? “ Every woman”?

Stats Watch Readers: Lots of material today, because I’m including yesterday’s Stats, too. –lambert Productivity and Costs, Q1 2017 (First Estimate): “It took more hours to produce at a slower rate in the latest quarter in what is yet another unfavorable productivity report” [Econoday]. “Weak productivity raises the cost of labor which came in well above expectations at an annualized 3.0 percent.” You say “raises the cost of labor” like that’s a bad thing! Factory Orders, March 2017: “Factory orders, like much of the economy, fizzled in March, up only 0.2 percent and skewed higher for a third month in a row by aircraft” [Econoday]. “Aircraft had a weak year last year and have been making up lost ground so far this year. But how long Boeing can give total orders a lift is uncertain, and the performance of the wider factory sector, despite sky high strength in many anecdotal reports, has been no better than mixed.” And but: “According to the seasonally adjusted data, it was military aircraft that caused the increase” [Econintersect]. “The data in this series is noisy so I would rely on the unadjusted 3 month rolling averages which was improved. Note that when one inflation adjusts, the numbers are good but not as good as the headlines. Backlog improved – but remains in contraction year-over-year.” ADP Employment Report, April 2017 (yesterday): “ADP’s estimate isn’t going to rattle any nerves ahead of April employment, at 177,000 and right in line with expectations for what is expected to be solid payroll growth in Friday’s report” [Econoday]. “There is little immediate reaction to today’s results.” Jobless Claims, week of April 29, 2017: “Week-to-week volatility has been pronounced but the trend in jobless claims is clearly favorable” [Econoday]. Gallup Good Jobs Rate, April 2017: “The U.S. workforce participation rate essentially held steady at 67.6 percent in April, little changed from 67.8 percent in March. The rate is roughly the same as a year ago, when workforce participation was 67.3 percent” [Econoday]. “The percentage of the population who is underemployed rose to 14.0 percent in April, up from 13.5 percent last month. The current underemployment rate is roughly equal to that of January (14.1 percent) and February (13.9 percent), as well as a year ago (13.8 percent). Underemployment is still far better than its high point of 20.3 percent recorded in March 2010.” Challenger Job-Cut Report, April 2017: “Challenger’s layoff count for April is a moderate 36,602, right in line with recent trend and pointing to healthy conditions in the labor market ahead of tomorrow’s employment report” [Econoday]. “Retail has been at the top of the layoff list all year and is once again in April, at 11,669. Next is autos at 3,424 and health care at 3,153.” And: “Employers have announced a total of 162,803 planned job cuts through the first four months of 2017. That is down 35 percent from the 249,061 job cuts tracked during the same period a year ago. It is the lowest January-April total since 2014, when the opening four months of the year saw 161,639 job cuts” [Econintersect]. Gallup U.S. Job Creation Index, April 17 (yesterday): “Gallup’s job creation index reading was plus 36 in April, one point off the record high of plus 37 in March. The Midwest led the regions at plus 42 — the first time any region has topped plus 40 in the nine-year history of the index” [Econoday]. “Workers in the Midwest became increasingly likely to say their companies were hiring rather than firing in April, even as workers elsewhere reported more stagnant job creation patterns. In the other three U.S. regions, the East, South and West, the job creation index dropped one point each from March.” Hmm. Trump country. Purchasing Managers’ Services Index, April 2017 (yesterday): “Order growth is described as subdued and, in what is a negative indication for Friday’s employment report, the sample reported the weakest growth in hiring in nearly 7 years” [Econoday]. “Despite the late April bounce in the headline, there are plenty of red signals in this report that don’t point to a second quarter surge for the economy.” Institute For Supply Management Non-Manufacturing Index, April 2017 (yesterday): “Two different samples and two very different results from PMI services, which was released earlier this morning and was very soft, and ISM non-manufacturing which is pointing to sharp acceleration” [Econoday]. “O]ne detail both this report and PMI services do agree on is that hiring during April was slow. This is not a positive indication for Friday’s employment report where solid growth is the expectation.” But: “This suggests faster expansion in April than in March” [Calculated Risk]. International Trade, March 2017: “Breaking down the data between goods and services shows a small widening in the goods deficit to $65.5 billion offset in part by a modest looking but still constructive $0.4 billion dollar rise in the surplus on services. The overall decline in exports and imports is a concern, but today’s report has several positives, not only the surplus on services but also the rise in capital goods exports” [Econoday]. “On the import side most components are lower especially capital goods in what, along with capital goods shipments and nonresidential construction spending, is another contrast with the first-quarter GDP surge in nonresidential investment.” And but: “But the data in this series wobbles and the 3 month rolling averages are the best way to look at this series. The 3 month averages are accelerating” [Econintersect]. “This data will have minimal impact on 1Q2017 GDP.” And: “Exports are 15% above the pre-recession peak and up 9% compared to March 2016; imports are 1% above the pre-recession peak, and up 7% compared to March 2016” [Calculated Risk]. “In general, trade has been picking up, but has declined slightly the last two months.” Bloomberg Consumer Comfort Index, week of April 20, 2017: “The consumer comfort index, like other confidence readings, continues to hold at expansion highs” [Econoday].

This article is dangerously close to stock-picking, but I’m including it because — granted, I may be showing my age, here — the only brand I recognize is Sears. And you can certainly argue that Sears — despite owning the most depressing store I have ever entered, at the Bangor Mall — is a “squillionaire with bright ideas” story, not an “Internet’s killing retail” story.

As sales boomed in recent years, most factories cranked out cars without a break. This summer, widespread closures may be back, and for weeks longer than before. The reason: four straight months of declining sales and little expectation the trend will reverse anytime soon.” This too is Trump country. Auto: “A surprising drop in U.S. auto demand is sending shudders through the industry’s global supply chain. GM’s sales declined 5.8% in April from a year ago, and Ford and Fiat Chrysler reported drops of around 7%, leaving a glut of unsold cars and trucks on dealers’ lots. The weak figures threaten a nearly eight-year winning streaK for the auto industry, and some manufacturers are already shutting down some production… Auto makers have already scaled back work on passenger cars as fuel prices have remained low, shifting factory output to gas-guzzling trucks and SUVs.

And something to consider for those trying to automate the supplly chain… Shipping: “Leading shippers are increasingly using supply chains as strategic tools – as a business enabler, revenue driver and differentiator, according to supply chain expert and author Mark Millar, who says the latest strategic thinking is that “supply chain is the business” of many companies that are not ostensibly logistics specialists” [Lloyd’s List]. “‘Twenty-first-century supply chains have transformed into worldwide inter-connected supply-and-demand networks – exposed to the vulnerabilities of our uncertain world – and with profound interdependencies,’ he adds. ‘This has led to greater deployment of collaborative partnerships, frequently involving outsourcing and off-shoring, creating elongated webs that embrace multiple stakeholders.'” The author is a consultant talking his deck.

An Uber driver agreed to share their data: “Over 165 trips from early March to early April, Uber overcharged this driver’s passengers by a total of $85.54. In other words, the total upfront fares paid by riders were that much higher than the fares used to calculate driver pay. The company lost money overall on UberPool, its carpooling service, but more than made it up by overcharging customers who booked trips on UberX and its other private ride options.” The Bezzle: “Uber and Waymo Duel at Key Hearing Over Driverless Car Technology” [New York Times]. “At stake is what Uber and Waymo both believe could be a multibillion-dollar opportunity in the transportation industry in which autonomous cars move people around without the need or expense of human drivers.” The Bezzle: “Major NYC Crime Ring Used Fake Uber Drivers to Hide Drug Deals: Sources” [NBC New York]. “As part of the operation, the six suspects placed fake Uber logos and stickers on vehicles to fit into the neighborhoods and not raise suspicions, according to sources. Heroin and cocaine were sold to more than 100 customers in upper Manhattan and the Bronx, the sources said. The dealers weren’t drivers for Uber and it appears they didn’t use the Uber app, but they did utilize the company’s logo to disguise their vehicles while making deliveries, sources said.” That’s so meta.

Donate $25$50$75$100 00200 This entry was posted in Guest Post, Water Cooler on May 4, 2017 by Lambert Strether. About Lambert Strether Readers, I have had a correspondent characterize my views as realistic cynical. Let me briefly explain them. I believe in universal programs that provide concrete material benefits, especially to the working class. Medicare for All is the prime example, but tuition-free college and a Post Office Bank also fall under this heading. So do a Jobs Guarantee and a Debt Jubilee. Clearly, neither liberal Democrats nor conservative Republicans can deliver on such programs, because the two are different flavors of neoliberalism (“Because markets”). I don’t much care about the “ism” that delivers the benefits, although whichever one does have to put common humanity first, as opposed to markets. Could be a second FDR saving capitalism, democratic socialism leashing and collaring it, or communism razing it. I don’t much care, as long as the benefits are delivered. To me, the key issue — and this is why Medicare for All is always first with me — is the tens of thousands of excess “deaths from despair,” as described by the Case-Deaton study, and other recent studies. That enormous body count makes Medicare for All, at the very least, a moral and strategic imperative. And that level of suffering and organic damage makes the concerns of identity politics — even the worthy fight to help the refugees Bush, Obama, and Clinton’s wars created — bright shiny objects by comparison. Hence my frustration with the news flow — currently in my view the swirling intersection of two, separate Shock Doctrine campaigns, one by the Administration, and the other by out-of-power liberals and their allies in the State and in the press — a news flow that constantly forces me to focus on matters that I regard as of secondary importance to the excess deaths. What kind of political economy is it that halts or even reverses the increases in life expectancy that civilized societies have achieved? I am also very hopeful that the continuing destruction of both party establishments will open the space for voices supporting programs similar to those I have listed; let’s call such voices “the left.” Volatility creates opportunity, especially if the Democrat establishment, which puts markets first and opposes all such programs, isn’t allowed to get back into the saddle. Eyes on the prize! I love the tactical level, and secretly love even the horse race, since I’ve been blogging about it daily for fourteen years, but everything I write has this perspective at the back of it.

Irises can be transplanted pretty easily. We split out our bulbs last year and I think we had a 100% transplant success with a whole mess of them. They are really great blooms. Smells like you’re getting away with something. Reply ↓ Jim Haygood May 4, 2017 at 3:04 pm Apparently irises are not tasty to deer and elk, making them good plantings for Wildland-Urban Interface areas [this is an actual term used in California codes]. Though I’ve heard of elk ripping them out, giving the irises a couple of chews, spitting them out — ptui! — then moving on to tastier lawns. It’s their version of wine tasting: sniff, swirl in the mouth, expectorate. Reply ↓ polecat May 4, 2017 at 5:44 pm Al parts of the Iris are poisonous …. so don’t lick your fingers after transplanting … especially children !

Reply ↓ a different chris May 4, 2017 at 3:45 pm >Irises can be transplanted pretty easily I would like to have Irises again, but I was always forced to transplant since I might get a decent 2nd year but after that grass has always completely invaded the iris patch. Since they pretty much sit on the ground surface I couldn’t mulch them like I could stuff like peonies. So how do you keep the grass from invading? Or do I just have a particularly virulent form of grass? Reply ↓ Ivy May 4, 2017 at 7:58 pm Strip off the grass, a healthy workout that avoids the use of Roundup. Then put down landscape mesh with holes for the irises, and add mulch. Reply ↓ JohnnyGL May 4, 2017 at 2:19 pm https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-will-democrats-demand-of-their-2020-nominee/ Interesting read to see where the 538 pundits see things. First part on health care and min wage, they all agree that the Dem base and electorate are moving left on econ issues and the 2020 nominee will probably need to reflect that change. My favorite part is how Nate Silver himself rapidly transitions from Single-Payer to something called a “supercharged public option”. I don’t know about the rest of the Nakedcap community, but I’m always in favor of anything that’s “supercharged”. I mean, it can’t be another bait-and-switch, can it???? LOL?!?!?! In other news, none of them seem terribly convinced by Cuomo or Booker. Much like the rest of the public, I suppose. Reply ↓ Pat May 4, 2017 at 2:48 pm Having seen Booker in action, I would not count him out. I may not get it, but the guy has both charisma, crowd and individual people skills. Cuomo, has about as much chance of being President as Jeb Bush did after Trump. But it is nice of Nate to finally notice that 1.) the majority of the public has already moved ‘far left’ as defined today on certain core issues like having health care and getting a long over due raise, and 2.) that politicians also have to notice that. Too bad he hasn’t figured out they are not so accepting of pretty words signifying nothing like ‘Affordable Care’. Reply ↓ Uahsenaa May 4, 2017 at 4:38 pm Booker is decent in person, but he has the massive albatross of Wall Street money hanging around his neck, just like Clinton. Not to mention, he’s already been called out several times for some of his dodgier votes in the Senate. It wouldn’t take a whole lot for a primary opponent to paint him the way Sanders did Clinton, and he wouldn’t necessarily have the benefit of a predetermined DNC coronation to protect him from that criticism like she did in the 2016 primaries. If single-payer wins out in CA, then it will be much harder for those aspiring to progressive-hood to hide behind weasel policies like the public option, be it super-charged or no. And free college tuition (admittedly, of a limited sort) has already made headway in New York. The Overton window has moved substantially just since the election. Primary Dems will be hard-pressed to pretend the political landscape even resembles that of 2016, much less 2008, when things like the public option were de rigeur. Reply ↓ Darius May 4, 2017 at 4:54 pm Booker is not as good as Obama at the inspiring young man thing and he’s been less artful in being a Wall Street errand boy. Reply ↓ PH May 4, 2017 at 6:11 pm Booker is shallow and warped. His idea of nirvana is being liked by Republicans. He is not alone in this. Carper comes to mind. But he is pathological in his obsequious devotion to bi-partisanship. He is bought and sold by natural gas and chemical companies. Major yuk. Reply ↓ Pat May 4, 2017 at 11:11 pm I really hope so. Despite my belief that Booker on the campaign trail is going to be pulling in people like flies to honey, he is someone else who would sell out his mother. But unless and until them in context, But after Bill Clinton, Obama and yes, Trump, I can’t throw out his chances without seeing the race in context. He has about two and a half years to confuse the record and with his people skills, that may be enough. Reply ↓ Big River Bandido May 4, 2017 at 7:05 pm I don’t see how a politician — from New Jersey, no less — who can be so easily defined as a tool of health insurance and pharma, gets elected President of a nation where he’ll have to appeal to workers in Iowa, Wisconsin, Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania. I don’t care how many sidewalks he shoveled in Newark. A majority of voters in those states are wise to the neoliberal game. If Brexit (and the likely result of the French runoff) are any clue, the austerity and ID politics blend is completely played out. It’s not going to work — not well enough for any “Democrat” to get to 270, regardless of what happens in Frnace. Similar factors prevented Clinton from winning, and will preclude any chance of Cuomo as well (not withstanding his grating personality). Reply ↓ TK421 May 4, 2017 at 2:54 pm the 2020 nominee will probably need to reflect that change. Yes, because the Democratic nominating process is free and fair and open, and highly responsive to the public. Reply ↓ Pat May 4, 2017 at 3:06 pm Perhaps they should have added “if they want to win”, in order to make it clear the choice the Democratic leadership truly face. (And the Democratic voting base if the leadership decides to go down with the grift ignoring the will of their base and the voting public). Reply ↓ Romancing The Loan May 4, 2017 at 3:12 pm if the leadership decides to go down with the grift ignoring the will of their base and the voting public Yet again. Pelosi said today she didn’t see single payer as something the Ds should run on in 2018. So, you know, breathless anticipation. Reply ↓ RUKidding May 4, 2017 at 3:25 pm Pelosi and all (or at least most) are so totally bought off that they will never ever vote for Single Payer. NEVER. Why citizens keep wanting to trust these rapacious criminals is beyond my understanding. Reply ↓ Carla May 4, 2017 at 11:11 pm Nobody wants to trust them, and nobody does. But what are voters going to do? Vote for their to-the-right-of-Attila-the-hun counterparts? I vote 3rd party, along with 1% of the electorate. That’s not exactly a winning strategy either. Until people on the “left” desert the Democrat party wholesale and start a new party, there’s no hope for the electoral system. Reply ↓ TK421 May 4, 2017 at 3:24 pm I understand that you are a rational person and you approach things rationally. But the Democratic leadership would much rather lose with a Hillary-type than win with Bernie. They don’t exist to win, they exist to serve their donors. Reply ↓ JohnnyGL May 4, 2017 at 3:40 pm That’s true, but if they don’t win, the donors won’t bother writing checks anymore. Reply ↓ markopher May 4, 2017 at 5:32 pm I think it is better for the wealthy elites to keep donating to the democrats no matter how much they lose because they are an easily controlled “opposition”, whereas if the democrats die out slowly something will emerge to its left to replace it, and the donors will (at least temporarily) only have control over one of the two major parties, which would be a disaster for them. Reply ↓ Carla May 4, 2017 at 11:15 pm “whereas if the democrats die out slowly something will emerge to its left to replace it,” Well that’s on us, ain’t it? How pathetic is that? Let’s just wait around with our thumbs up our asses, secure in our faith that the democrats will eventually die out. Why not adopt Lambert’s expression and apply it to the frigging democrats: “Kill it with fire!” Reply ↓ Mark P.

Not that most of them aren’t denying it as hard as they possibly can, in the hopes that it’ll just go away. Reply ↓ PH May 4, 2017 at 6:17 pm Bluedog leaders think populism will blow over. Think populism is “problem” only in deep blue coastal states. Think populists cannot win in purple states; think only Republican-lite can win in purple states. We must find good Progrssive candidates in at least acouple purple states and win. Meanwhile, win some Dem primaries in deepblue states. Only then will bluedog leaders be even slightly chastened. Reply ↓ Big River Bandido May 4, 2017 at 7:06 pm Sure they will. The lower the Democrats’ actual political fortunes go, the cheaper they are to buy off. Reply ↓ different clue May 4, 2017 at 9:06 pm The DemParty leaders define winning differently than you or I would define it. I would consider a New Deal Revival to be a kind of winning. The InnerParty Dems consider preventing any ReNew Deal from ever emerging to be the kind of winning which they and their owner-patrons are interested in. Reply ↓ John k May 4, 2017 at 9:12 pm It’s well known they would rather lose with a rep right winger than win with a progressive, no matter how popular. Bot more than that… the more reprehensible the rep the better because it seems more likely they can win next time on the rebound, proving their hope they can continue trashing progressives and courting reps. Won’t work for this (former) one. Never, ever. Reply ↓ PKMKII May 4, 2017 at 3:14 pm Well what a literal supercharger does is compress air before feeding into the engine.

Reply ↓ NotTimothyGeithner May 4, 2017 at 5:04 pm Obama just happened. It will be a while before it can happen again. Booker is a goofier and loopy who seems like hes out to host a self help seminar. Obama had his followers, but there was a fair amount of anti-Clinton and anti-war support for him in 2008. Cuomo is the son of a governor. He has no charisma and has accomplished jack. If he was the Democratic governor of Wyoming despite his New York roots, that would be one thing,but he has been governor of New York and has not developed anything beyond appearing to really want to run for President. Sanders did best among people who receive their news from the internet which means they have unfiltered access to his past. They don’t rely on Maddow. Sanders isn’t just some guy saying nice things. He has a record much like Hillary. One has fought for women and children, and one, as Jimmy Dore put it, sounded like a female Bill O’Reilly in the 90’s. Going forward, candidates will not be able to hide from the past. The Clintons are gone beyond spoilers, and no Democrat holds popular power anymore.

Haven’t heard much from her on, e.g., opioids. I wouldn’t be surprised if she loses in ’18 (cf. her weak polling from back in January). She seems to epitomize that class of what I call educational colonialists*, who come here, drive prices up and people out of their neighborhoods, and then evince indifference/quaint patronization at best, virulent contempt and patrician class/regional hatred at worst, for those of us who are actually from here. We see that, and we don’t like it.

Reply ↓ allan May 4, 2017 at 2:24 pm Anti-antidote: Noise pollution is invading even the most protected natural areas [Science] The great outdoors is becoming a lot less peaceful. Noise pollution from humans has doubled sound levels in more than half of all protected areas in the United States—from local nature reserves to national parks—and it has made some places ten times louder, according to a new study. And the cacophony isn’t just bad for animals using natural sounds to hunt and forage—it could also be detrimental to human health. … The excess noise can do more than just annoy park visitors. It can also undo the benefits of spending time in nature, like improved mood and memory retention. For plants and animals, the ruckus can disrupt entire communities. Some plants need silence for seed dispersal—revving cars can scare away rodents that might otherwise do the job. Animals need silence to hear predators approaching or to communicate with their mates: A bird whose song would normally travel 100 meters would, with a tenfold increase in noise, have its melody stifled to a 10-meter radius. “In so many landscapes, both people and other organisms are living in shrunken perceptual worlds,” says Clinton Francis, an ecologist at California Polytechnic State University in San Luis Obispo, who was not involved in the work. … Where some see “shrunken perceptual worlds” others see disruptive investment opportunities. Like access to fresh water, silence is not a human right but rather a scarce commodity that needs to be price discovered.

It took me a day to figure out what was SO different: no airplanes ever flew overhead the whole 5 days I was there.

Reply ↓ Big River Bandido May 4, 2017 at 6:26 pm That quote rings so true with me, and I admit don’t get enough time in nature because there’s so little of it in my urban neighborhood. But why shouldn’t “citizens” (residents of cities) also have the benefit of “peace and quiet space”? Amtrak’s Quiet Car is a great idea. Too bad Amtrak doesn’t really want it and won’t enforce their own policy to make it function, but their charade is exemplary of how the mob mentality has degraded public manners and the civility of the common space, and how institutions just don’t give a rat. Whether you’re in an open or enclosed area, the noise level in urban public spaces is out of control, and a great contributor to antisocial behavior in those environments. The constant screams of sirens, the paranoid wailing of car alarms, and the bleating and blaring from teevees and radios plays like the soundtrack of a psychotic nightmare which deprives people of sleep and peace of mind. One siren or car alarm in my neighborhood can ruin the sleep of a thousand people in four city blocks, and the sound travels a lot farther than that. I dread trips to the grocery store, for fear of being force-fed yet another insipid, skin-crawling record by Michael Bublé or Adam Lambert. And is there any wonder that travelers at the major airports are stressed out? If you go to LaGuardia or JFK or O’Hare, you can hear all kinds of music in the shops and terminal corridor speakers: “four on the floor” disco, EDM, urban contemporary, and so-called “chart hits”. All at once, along with teevees and cell phones. There’s a teevee monitor for CNN mounted into the ceilings — every fifteen to twenty feet. Often, Wolf Blitzer’s so loud he drowns out the announcements for your flight. If only there was so much as a square meter where you could wait for a flight and hear *none* of that, other than the announcements, but there isn’t, anywhere. And if somehow you *do* manage to find such a space, you can be sure that some asshole in a pinstriped suit and penny loafers, negotiating his next deal into his cell phone, will come and take the seat next to you — or, if there’s no seat there, he’ll pace up and down by the windows so that his voice bounces off the glass and can be heard by everyone at the gate. Oh, and those scenarios I just described? That’s what it’s like at 5AM. The rest of the day, it’s even worse. Sadly, one of the most offensive weapons of noise pollution is music — an art form intended to uplift and which at its best still does — but in its common and debased form it is used (and abused) like a stimulant. It’s like music only in the way that fast food is like…food. All these “commercial messages” compete for eyes and ears which mostly aren’t watching, and certainly aren’t listening, although that’s not the same thing as not hearing. Reply ↓ WhyPrivate?

I’ve seen more than a few of them on Twitter lament how the GOP is trying to destroy “universal healthcare.” That anyone could believe that the ACA came anywhere close to universal healthcare is astonishing. While this terrible bill that’s going to make a bad situation worse is all on the GOP, the Democrats paved the way for it when they did have power. If this bill passes, and all the Democrats got is “In 2018, when we win the elections, we’ll restore Obamacare!”, AHCA is here to stay. Reply ↓ Pat May 4, 2017 at 3:18 pm Well I will, largely because they doubled down on protect the ACA rather than saying: “okay this didn’t work because we tried ‘market based’ reform designed by Republicans rather than noticing what has worked the world over and going for single payer. You want it repealed, we understand why. Despite being better for some than we had before it is still too expensive and ends up denying too many care. What we want in America is Medicare for All. Now. And any repeal that is not single payer along the lines of Medicare for All is going to be just as bad OR worse than ACA, and will ultimately cost the American people personally and as taxpayers far too much money much of which will go into the pockets of Insurance company executives whose whole reason for business is to sell you insurance you don’t use, either because you don’t need it OR because they can deny you access to the health care you are paying to be able to get.” Reply ↓ PH May 4, 2017 at 6:28 pm None of the Dem candidates in GA special election put that on their campaign website.

Reply ↓ PKMKII May 4, 2017 at 5:25 pm It would have had to require nuking the filibuster; no amount of bully pulpiting would have gotten Lieberman to go along with the public option, let alone Medicare for all. And yeah, Obama wouldn’t (didn’t) have done that. Man was too married to the idea of doing things the “respectful” way in DC. But even if he had, I’m not convinced it would have passed. I think the value of the bully pulpit move is overrated, if it has any anymore (see: Republicans yawning at Trump’s ultimatum). Reply ↓ Pat May 4, 2017 at 6:06 pm There were many things that could have been used to get Lieberman to go along, none of it bully pulpit, all of it big stick. But that would have meant that someone other Kucinich would need to be shown the light. But then Barry and Joe were besties, so much that Lieberman faced NO payback from the Dems for telling the world to vote for John McCain. They were on the same page, along with Baucus and the Emanuel brothers, and… Could Medicare for All be passed? Maybe not all at once, but they certainly could have done Medikids (which because of child health issues included prenatal and obstetrics) and maybe lowered the Medicare entry age to 50 or 55. With a plan leaked on every front page in America to continue to move towards covering every America after passage. There was a route for this. But frankly the reason we got the Heritage/Dole/Romney plan as rewritten by Insurance/pharma/private medical was BECAUSE it was the Republican plan and they thought it was going to be a win/win bipartisan health reform- the legacy of a lifetime. After they figured out it was going to be all theirs they couldn’t back out. I’ve always figured they just did it to avoid the embarrassment, walked away and hoped it would work the way the Republicans had said it would despite all evidence to the contrary. Reply ↓ Darius May 4, 2017 at 6:07 pm Why do nonRepublicans keep ignoring budget reconciliation? Is this willful self-disempowerment? The bill passed today is a budget reconciliation bill. It isn’t subject to the Senate filibuster. Doesn’t mean the Senate will pass this manure pile. Obama could have gotten a budget reconciliation bill loaded like a Christmas tree if he had an agenda. Most of the Democrats would have followed him anywhere in early 2009. The Republicans were afraid of him for the five minutes it took them to get his number. Even some of them may have been intimidated into voting for it the way Republicans intimidated a number of Democrats into voting for the Bush tax cuts. The Republicans never got 60 senators to vote for Bush’s tax cuts. They used budget reconciliation each time. The Republicans know all this. Democrats either don’t know this or don’t want to. Please people. Know basic procedure. Obama didn’t have to jump through hoops to pass a basic liberal agenda.

They were working towards what they wanted: a situation where they could use more openly corporate sell-outs like Lieberman and Baucus as faux obstacles to make sure they had an excuse to not give citizens what they wanted and needed. It wasn’t an accident, and Obama wasn’t victimized by the Republicans. He started backtracking on every single of one his campaign promises practically the second the votes came in election night. Of course, he had already privately done this. It’s just that it started being revealed at that point.

Reply ↓ MyLessThanPrimeBeef May 4, 2017 at 4:27 pm From the CNN article in the Links: Prior to the health reform law, consumers who have or who previously had medical issues — even if it were years earlier and completely resolved — could be denied coverage or charged much more in premiums. Obamacare remedies that by requiring insurers to cover everyone and charge them the same amount, regardless of their health history. Also, it mandates all policies cover 10 essential health benefits, including prescription drugs, hospitalization and doctors’ visits, so the sick could be assured their treatments are covered. “The rules under Obamacare were comprehensive,” said Karen Pollitz, senior fellow at the non-partisan Kaiser Family Foundation. This expansive coverage, however, comes with a high price tag. It bumps up the cost of premiums for everyone. That’s why the conservative Freedom Caucus set its sights on getting rid of these popular provisions. Related: Key GOP lawmakers flip on health care after Trump meeting Under the most recent version of the GOP repeal bill, states would be allowed to opt out of requiring insurers to cover everyone at the same price and to offer all 10 essential health benefits in all policies. This would likely lead insurers to jack up rates for those with pre-existing conditions who didn’t maintain continuous coverage and to offer skimpy plans that don’t pay for the treatments the sick need.</blockquote ——- 1. Is it still a plan if it doesn't offer 'doctors visits?' That is scary. And I have to ask, is it me not reading it correctly, or is it on the writer? 2. It bumps up the cost of premiums for everyone…those popular provisions. Probably the situation is more complex. Intuitively, more costly for everyone is not often associated with being popular. 3. jack up rates for those with pre-existing conditions who didn't maintain continuous coverage. Those with pre-existing conditions are today covered for those who are not paying a penalty. They are in 'continuous' coverage, are they not? And the risk is jacked up rates – that is, a money issue. The difference between Medicare for All, and Free Medicare for All is also a money issue. Reply ↓ Ian May 4, 2017 at 4:30 pm This is a gift to the corporate democrats as it provides cover for and shifts blame to the GOP in regards to a system that was well on its way to painfully dying.

A lot more revisionism is coming our way as the terrible reality that was Obama will be made out to look like Trump is the root cause of what is going on.

Really look at what they are doing they are throwing it all to the states. The STATES are going to make it all worse. And when they go to run in 2018 or 20 or 22, they can face those voters and say I wasn’t the one that decided to do X, it was the state legislature and the governor. We gave them the tools to make it better, it isn’t my/our fault if they haven’t. It was the only way they could figure to get out of being the ones that said that because your kid had X they could be denied insurance (forget afford it, get it at all). Or your spouse…or you.

They fundamentally betrayed their base and the people that voted them in leading to the rise of the Repubs which further hamstrung the Dems from being able to act in the interests of the general populace. Neither party has any interest in seeing the other party defeated as that continuing conflict allows for the fundamental continual betrayel of governing while behaving like a failed state and provides cover for both sides.The Dems need a boost to remain competitive and on a side note I personally think that Trump is sick of the job and wants to lose for the 2nd term.

Where would the Dems be despite whatever the Repubs did, when the actual progressives could point to a collapsed ACA with severe escalating rates, terrible deductables and terrible networks. How would the Corporate Dems survive that when it is in essence their baby? The AHCA looks like it cut out some of the most popular elements and some of the most expensive ones too, worsening it but likely reducing the rate of escalating costs and preserving the exploitative crap built into it. So yes it is noticebly worse, but it also means the Dems get cover and the core of the system put in place is saved. Now the Dems will be able to point to ACA and say we were better off while the Repubs delay the death spiral and both sides strangle the progressives. Please correct me if I am wrong as I willingly admit, I rarely feel qualified too comment on this site and am always open to more complete perspectives. David Carl Grimes May 4, 2017 at 4:41 pm Why repeal Obamacare? Why not let it die a natural death?

Reply ↓ Marina Bart May 4, 2017 at 8:16 pm The ACA is dying anyway, it wouldn’t last ten years no matter what. It’s doing very little good as it is right now, and it’s doing it by handing huge amounts of grifter cash to the insurance industry, while setting a pretty creepy precedent about forcing citizens to give private companies money without getting anything back in return. And we’d be openly at war, right now, on the Russian Front, if Hillary had won. We’d be in an open shooting war in Syria, with the New York Times screaming about how it’s a fight for freedom and babies — even more than it already is. TPP would be the law of the land, which means the law of the global corporate ruling empire. Even if the Senate passes AHCA — which would hurt my family, I think (haven’t checked the details, but we’re vulnerable in couple of different ways) — I have no regrets about Hillary losing. None. She’s have the privatization of Social Security fast-tracked, too. I’m not sure the Freedom Caucus would have saved us again.

Where the Trump administration will score in warlike-ness in general is a question for which we don’t have enough information to answer yet. Whether TPP comes back in some other form is a question for which we don’t have enough information to answer yet, the European one (TTIP) does not seem completely dead yet. One can say it’s a reprieve, but if this breather doesn’t even last a couple of years before one of these trade agreements is forced on us (Congress does still have Fast Track), it’s hard to say it was one at all frankly. AHCA can harm family members here too, in the long run if they need expanded Medicaid and it isn’t there. Since they still are able to afford ACA plans at present, as for changes to ACA plans like pre-existing conditions, I think blue states are going to block a lot of this stuff in their states (that’s not a certainty but I think it’s highly probable). So if it’s left up to the states, I think those living in deep blue states might avoid much of the purely insurance based changes. Red states are going to be ENTIRELY 3rd world by the time Republicans are done with them. Reply ↓ NotTimothyGeithner May 4, 2017 at 4:48 pm Given Hillary and Bill’s political record and high negatives, yes, the people who put up those grifters are part of the problem.

Reply ↓ Praedor May 4, 2017 at 10:06 pm I no longer buy into the “we don’t control the House/Senate so we can’t do anything” spiel. Here’s the reality: When the Dems are in control, the GOP runs the agenda (and the Democraps whine about how obstructionist the GOP is). When the Dems are in the minority, the GOP runs the agenda (and the Democraps whine about how they aren’t in control). Every time. They only logical conclusion is IT’S A SCAM. The Democraps are scammers. They LIKE what the GOP is doing and what they do because they NEVER EVER really resist (they don’t want to be “obstructionists”…the horror!). Reply ↓ Vatch May 4, 2017 at 4:25 pm If the Democrats had used their power in 2009 to pass something good, we wouldn’t be worrying about repeal. Even if the Democrats had passed something good in 2009 or 2010, instead of The Thing that they did pass, the Republicans would still be trying to repeal it. They would probably claim that is costs too much or that it is socialism, so it must be repealed. Reply ↓ Lambert Strether Post authorMay 4, 2017 at 4:27 pm These things aren’t static. If the Democrats had passed Medicare for All in 2009, they win in 2010 (holding onto the Senate), and win the Presidency in 2012 and 2016, as people claim the universal direct material benefit. Reply ↓ Vatch May 4, 2017 at 4:58 pm What you say is quite possible. But we’ll never know; it’s also possible that the Republicans would have won the Presidency in 2012, because Medicare for All would have proved that Obama is a socialist. We underestimate the power of big money in politics at our peril. People frequently vote against their interests, and many people simply don’t vote, which is also against their interests. Reply ↓ Vatch May 4, 2017 at 5:05 pm Clarification: When I said “Medicare for All would have proved that Obama is a socialist”, I meant that this is what Republicans would have claimed, and many people would have believed them. I did not mean that he really would have been a socialist. Reply ↓ Jeff W May 4, 2017 at 5:23 pm “…it’s also possible that the Republicans would have won the Presidency in 2012, because Medicare for All would have proved that Obama is a socialist.” That’s possible but far more unlikely. Given the reality of Medicare-for-All, people would adjust their view of what “socialist” meant—either Medicare-for-All is not that or, if it is, then “socialist” is not so bad. Opponents of Social Security and Medicare similarly vilified those programs as “socialism”—no one cared. Reply ↓ Darius May 4, 2017 at 6:16 pm See Marina Bart’s post from yesterday.

Reply ↓ Vatch May 4, 2017 at 7:02 pm @Jeff W: Opponents of Social Security and Medicare similarly vilified those programs as “socialism”—no one cared. Actually, a lot of people did and do care, unfortunately. Try changing the mind of a person who believes that Social Security will be bankrupt 20 years from now. Social Security began very slowly, and Medicare initially only affected a relatively small portion of the population. I don’t disagree with you; I’ve asked my Representative to co-sponsor HR676, I voted for and donated to Sanders, etc. @Darius: If Obama had implemented an actual full employment policy, the Democrats would have been the dominant political force for a generation. How would he have done that? Republicans and a lot of Democrats are adamantly opposed to such policies. You’re not wrong, but the possibility of enacting something like that is quite remote.

Reply ↓ Jeff W May 4, 2017 at 5:08 pm I agree with lambert. And the entire frame of the debate changes, besides. Everyone in the US can (presumably) go to the doctor or the hospital without worrying about co-pays, co-insurance, co-deductibles. No one’s dealing with what’s in-network or out-of-network. No one has to fight with the insurance company about insurance claims or even be concerned that his or her insurance premium is paid on time. No one is going bankrupt because of medical bills. The Republicans are stuck with arguing that whatever system they’re proposing is somehow better than that. Reply ↓ Oregoncharles May 5, 2017 at 1:26 am Medicare has ” co-pays, co-insurance, co-deductibles.” The co-insurance can be quite substantial – I wound up paying an unexpected $1500 when I had surgery. The hospital had not predicted that. Granted, that was cheap surgery; but a lot of people would have been in deep trouble faced with that expense. It didn’t improve our situation any, either. Hence the call for IMPROVED Medicare for All. Reply ↓ Big River Bandido May 4, 2017 at 7:20 pm Programs that are truly universal are politically impervious because when everyone gains from the program, the constituency to defend the program mobilizes very naturally. ACA is a political sitting duck for two primary reasons: it benefits only *some* people, naturally alienating everyone else; and it’s designed not to deliver health care to people who need it, but to deliver health care customers to the insurance companies. That’s a much harder thing to defend. In my view, not worth defending at all — partly because its very presence tamps down the obvious appeal of the better solution, Medicare For All. Reply ↓ Praedor May 4, 2017 at 10:10 pm It would be politically impossible to repeal single-payer once it’s passed. EVERYONE having healthcare would scream bloody murder (and literally commit justified bloody murder) if the GOP tried to take healthcare away from so many people. Howls of outrage.

And condemning BDS is pretty much attacking an American freedom of expression which says I can vote with my pocketbook. Just as it is every neoliberals right to boycott any product produced or marketed by the Trump family and attempt to demand anything they invest in either by choice or as a group also not support those businesses, it is the right of any American to control what their money is spent on and how their investments are made. And considering that Israel recently passed laws essentially seizing Palestinian lands they allowed their citizens to illegally settle on… well I’m sure they would just say I’m not seeing the side of the squatters.

Criticizing Israel’s illegal occupation, colonization and annexation of Arab lands — a process which “celebrates” its 50th anniversary next month — has zero to do with the religion or ethnicity of the offenders.

If they can sell artisanal pickles at an artisanal price to artisanal pickle eaters, they can turn around and pay an artisanal organic price to organic artisanal cucumber growers. The organic artisanal cucumbers growers can use the money thereby earned to buy artisanal soil supplements and ammendments and artisanal organic plant foods. The people selling those organitisanal inputs can then turn around and buy shinola stuff instead of shit-stuff in their own lives. The money-as-medium-of-exchange can be kept flowing in circulateral currents while mediating and permitting the flow of organic artisanal goods and services in circulateral counter-currents. Well . . . it can work if enough people are ready to pay a shinola price for shinola pickles to make it work to the extent of supporting little local micro-economies scattered in various places. And keep the artisanal pickle makers surviving until Middle America decides that It Too deserves an artisanal pickle, if it is ready to pay the price. Is it a pure joke? Nothing but a joke? Maybe not. Here is a local bussiness making artisanal sauerkrauts and other artisanal fermented foods. They buy shinola vegetables from shinola farmers to make their shinola fermentafood.

McConnell is the architect who gave Republicans control of all three branches of government (massive resistance to the Obama administration; Merrick Garland, etc.) And he doesn’t want to get rid of the filibuster, so there is considerable horse-trading yet to be done. Also, his wife is in charge of the DOT, so infrastructure ka-ching in the normal course of events, even if Trump doesn’t come up with an actual infrastructure bill. And with the enormous amound of cr*p being hurled about in every direction, McConnell has somehow managed to stay clean.

The white, green and blue aircraft, with “C919” emblazoned on its tail, sped along the tarmac at Shanghai’s international airport and lifted off under overcast skies in front of thousands of dignitaries, aviation workers and enthusiasts. The narrow-body jet, which will compete with Boeing’s 737 and the Airbus A320, soon disappeared into the clouds carrying its skeleton crew of five pilots and engineers. State broadcaster CCTV sent out live footage from the plane, which had no passenger seats installed for the maiden flight. The jet is a symbol of China’s ambitions to muscle into a global jet market estimated to be worth US$2 trillion (S$2.8 trillion) over the next two decades, as well as Beijing’s broader “Made in China 2025” plan to spur home-made products, from medicines to robots.  “The significance is huge, it’s the first ever large-frame aircraft made in China,” Xiong Yuexi, a plane design expert at Beihang University in Beijing said ahead of the launch. “It has a great impact for the Chinese people and the domestic market.”  Attendees gather as a Chinese C919 passenger jet sits on the tarmac before its scheduled first flight at Pudong International Airport. PHOTO: REUTERS State television reported the plane’s test flight would last one-and-a-half hours at a height of around 3,000m and at a speeds of 290-300km per hour. According to aircraft tracker Flightradar24, the plane flew over the Yangtze River estuary and headed due north. The C919, made by state-owned Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC), has seen its test flight pushed back at least twice since 2014 due to production issues, underlining the scale of the task facing Beijing. China first gave the world a glimpse of the plane, which will be able to carry 158-168 passengers, in November 2015 when it rolled it out at a ceremony in Shanghai. Analysts, however, say the C919 will lag technologically behind improved versions of the A320 and 737 which will enter service in the next two years. China Eastern Airlines is the launch customer for the plane, which COMAC says has 570 orders from 23 customers. The plane also relies on an array of overseas technology, with CFM International, a joint venture between General Electric’s aerospace arm and a unit of French firm Safran supplying the engines. Others include Honeywell International Inc, United Technologies Corp subsidiary Goodrich, Rockwell Collins Inc and a unit of Parker-Hannifin Corp. Spectators watch as a Chinese C919 passenger jet taxis for takeoff. PHOTO: AFP JUST THE START  Conceived in 2008, China wants the C919 to eventually take market share from Boeing and Airbus in the lucrative narrow-body market which accounts for more than 50 per cent of the aircraft in service worldwide.  However, the jet likely faces a lengthy journey from first flight to commercial usage. China’s first home-made jet, the regional ARJ-21, received its type certification in December 2014, six years after its first flight and more than 12 years after it was conceived. It made its maiden passenger flight in June last year. Then there is also the daunting task of selling the jet in a global market dominated by Boeing and Airbus.  “Aviation is a complex market and you need experience over a long time. Boeing has 100 years, Airbus has over 40 years,” said Sinolink Securities analyst Si Jingzhe, adding COMAC still lagged far behind in terms of supply chain know-how. China is pushing for recognition globally of its certification by European and US regulators. Without their certification, China would only be able to sell the jet to a handful of countries that accept its certification standards. Beijing is also already looking beyond the C919, with plans to develop a wide-body long-haul jet with Russia. In November COMAC and its partner United Aircraft Corp said they have started the hunt to find suppliers.

(Reuters/Stringer) Share Written by Steve Mollman Obsession China's Transition 6 hours ago China’s first nuclear submarine was a joke. Launched in the 1970s and now an exhibit in a museum, it was loud, couldn’t fire missiles while submerged, and exposed its crew to high levels of radiation. But it got the ball rolling. The nation’s modern subs make the US nervous with their technical advances, and China is now constructing the world’s largest submarine factory. It isn’t just the subs. While China still lags the US badly in some areas, and its exported weapons have had reliability issues, signs abound that its military hardware is either catching up or becoming good enough to pose a real challenge in a potential conflict. A military modernization program pushed by Chinese president Xi Jinping is spurring things along. “A ship that can fly” Last week the world’s largest amphibious aircraft made its first taxiing test. The AG600, made by the state-owned Aviation Industry Corporation of China, is about the size of the Boeing 737 and is designed for marine takeoff and landing (or it can use conventional airstrips). One of its designers describes it as a “ship that can fly.” The company says the plane will be used for marine rescue missions and fighting forest fires—it can scoop up 12 metric tons (13.2 tons) of water in 20 minutes. But given Beijing’s maritime ambitions in the South China Sea and elsewhere, the plane, with room for 50 passengers and a range of 4,500 km (2,800 miles), can also serve the People’s Liberation Army nicely, including via maritime patrols and troop and supplies transport—in other words, power projection. The hefty plane’s maiden flight over land is scheduled for this month, and over water later this year. A made-in-China aircraft carrier For years China has had just one operational aircraft carrier—hardly befitting an emerging maritime power. To make matters worse the Liaoning CV-16 was refitted from a laughably outdated Soviet-era Ukrainian ship. Last week China unveiled its first domestically built carrier at the northeast port of Dalian (see top image). The as-yet-unnamed vessel, to be fully operational in a few years, is technologically well behind its US counterparts. For instance it lacks a catapult to boost planes off the runway (making for inefficient operations) and uses conventional rather than nuclear power. But like China’s early subs, it’s a stepping stone to greater things. A third carrier is already under construction—one that more closely resembles a US carrier. Stealthy fighter jets China is making real progress in fighter jets, as evidenced by the J-20 that went into service in March. The supersonic aircraft packs stealth technology, advanced radar and sensor capabilities, and a nifty 360-degree helmet display that lets the pilot see “through” the aircraft itself. It’s also bigger than the US’s F-22 Raptor—to which it’s often compared—allowing it to hold more fuel and travel farther. While it might be stealthy from the front, however, it probably isn’t from the side. But China is testing another advanced fighter jet (the J-31) that does better in the stealth department and will possibly operate from aircraft carriers. Somewhat stealthy. (EPA/YhC) A new spy ship China launched in January a new electronic spy ship. The CNS Kaiyangxing, or Mizar, is capable of conducting all-weather, round-the-clock reconnaissance on multiple targets. During its unveiling, China shared an unusual amount of detail about the ship and the rest of its small intelligence fleet, now at about a half dozen vessels (the US has at least 15). That openness was probably for the deterrence factor: Beijing wants other navies know to that, should they operate in disputed waters, its forces will be able to detect them. Vessels like this one lack firepower but can be more dangerous than warships. A (really) long-range air-to-air missile Being able to hit enemy aircraft in a combat zone is expected. From well outside that zone? That’s a useful bonus. In January the state-run China Daily reported on a new, long-range air-to-air missile that could, a Chinese military researcher speculated, hit high-value targets like early-warning aircraft from up to 400 km (249 miles) away. That would be far better than China’s current range of less than 100 km for such missiles. It would also outdo US capabilities in that department—one where China might actually be in the lead.

By: Reuters | Published: May 5, 2017 6:35 AM The narrow-body aircraft, which will compete with Boeing’s 737 and the Airbus A320, is a key symbol of China’s ambitions to muscle into a global jet market estimated to be worth trillion over the next 20 years.(Reuters) China’s home-grown C919 passenger jet is set to take to the skies on its long-delayed maiden flight on Friday, a major step for Beijing as it looks to boost its profile in the global aviation market. The narrow-body aircraft, which will compete with Boeing’s 737 and the Airbus A320, is a key symbol of China’s ambitions to muscle into a global jet market estimated to be worth $2 trillion over the next 20 years. The jet will take to the skies at the Shanghai Pudong International Airport on China’s affluent east coast, at a ceremony expected to be broadcast live on state TV. The C919, made by state-owned Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC), has seen its test flight pushed back at least twice since 2014 due to production issues, underlining the scale of the task facing Beijing. “The significance is huge, it’s the first ever large-frame aircraft made in China,” said Xiong Yuexi, a professor and plane design expert at Beihang University in Beijing. “It has a great impact for the Chinese people and the domestic market.” You may also like to watch: China first gave the world a glimpse of the plane, which will be able to carry 158-168 passengers, in November 2015 when it rolled it out at a ceremony in Shanghai. For a FACTBOX on the C919, click Analysts, however, say the production delays mean the C919 will lag technologically behind improved versions of the A320 and 737 which will enter service in the next two years. China Eastern Airlines is the launch customer for the plane, which COMAC says has 570 orders from 23 customers. The plane also relies on an array of overseas technology, with CFM International, a joint venture between General Electric’s aerospace arm and a unit of French firm Safran , supplying the engines. Others include Honeywell International Inc, United Technologies Corp subsidiary Goodrich, Rockwell Collins Inc and a unit of Parker-Hannifin Corp. Conceived in 2008, China wants the C919 to eventually take market share from Boeing and Airbus in the lucrative narrow-body market which accounts for more than 50 percent of the aircraft in service worldwide. For a TIMELINE on the C919, click However, the jet likely faces a lengthy journey from first flight to commercial usage. China’s first home-made jet, the regional ARJ-21, received its type certification in December 2014, six years after its first flight and more than 12 years after it was conceived. It made its maiden passenger flight in June last year. Then there is also the daunting task of selling the jet in a global market dominated by Boeing and Airbus. “Aviation is a complex market and you need experience over a long time. Boeing has 100 years, Airbus has over 40 years,” said Sinolink Securities analyst Si Jingzhe, adding COMAC still lagged far behind in terms of supply chain know-how. China is pushing for recognition globally of its certification by European and U.S. regulators. Without their certification, China would only be able to sell the jet to a handful of countries that accept its certification standards. Beijing is also already looking beyond the C919, with plans to develop a wide-body long-haul jet with Russia. In November COMAC and its partner United Aircraft Corp said they have started the hunt to find suppliers.   No Comments.

Photo: Reuters mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 7:20 AM, May 5, 2017 Updated: 8:24 AM, May 5, 2017 SHANGHAI - China's home-grown C919 passenger jet is set to take to the skies on its long-delayed maiden flight on Friday, a major step for Beijing as it looks to boost its profile in the global aviation market. The narrow-body aircraft, which will compete with Boeing's <BA.N> 737 and the Airbus <AIR.PA> A320, is a key symbol of China's ambitions to muscle into a global jet market estimated to be worth $2 trillion over the next 20 years. RelatedNews World Timeline - China's C919 jet: from drawing board to take-off May 5 The jet will take to the skies at the Shanghai Pudong International Airport on China's affluent east coast, at a ceremony expected to be broadcast live on state TV. The C919, made by state-owned Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC) [CMAFC.UL], has seen its test flight pushed back at least twice since 2014 due to production issues, underlining the scale of the task facing Beijing. "The significance is huge, it's the first ever large-frame aircraft made in China," said Xiong Yuexi, a professor and plane design expert at Beihang University in Beijing. "It has a great impact for the Chinese people and the domestic market." China first gave the world a glimpse of the plane, which will be able to carry 158-168 passengers, in November 2015 when it rolled it out at a ceremony in Shanghai. For a FACTBOX on the C919, click Analysts, however, say the production delays mean the C919 will lag technologically behind improved versions of the A320 and 737 which will enter service in the next two years. China Eastern Airlines <600115.SS> is the launch customer for the plane, which COMAC says has 570 orders from 23 customers. The plane also relies on an array of overseas technology, with CFM International, a joint venture between General Electric's <GE.N> aerospace arm and a unit of French firm Safran <SAF.PA>, supplying the engines. Others include Honeywell International Inc <HON.N>, United Technologies Corp <UTX.N> subsidiary Goodrich, Rockwell Collins Inc <COL.N> and a unit of Parker-Hannifin Corp <PH.N>. Conceived in 2008, China wants the C919 to eventually take market share from Boeing and Airbus in the lucrative narrow-body market which accounts for more than 50 percent of the aircraft in service worldwide. For a TIMELINE on the C919, click However, the jet likely faces a lengthy journey from first flight to commercial usage. China's first home-made jet, the regional ARJ-21, received its type certification in December 2014, six years after its first flight and more than 12 years after it was conceived. It made its maiden passenger flight in June last year. Then there is also the daunting task of selling the jet in a global market dominated by Boeing and Airbus. "Aviation is a complex market and you need experience over a long time. Boeing has 100 years, Airbus has over 40 years," said Sinolink Securities analyst Si Jingzhe, adding COMAC still lagged far behind in terms of supply chain know-how. China is pushing for recognition globally of its certification by European and U.S. regulators. Without their certification, China would only be able to sell the jet to a handful of countries that accept its certification standards. Beijing is also already looking beyond the C919, with plans to develop a wide-body long-haul jet with Russia. In November COMAC and its partner United Aircraft Corp said they have started the hunt to find suppliers.

As good bull markets should, the market has climbed a skeptical “wall of worry.” That’s encouraging, as history has repeatedly shown that markets usually succumb in euphoric times when worries are not obvious. Momentum alone is likely to pull stocks further ahead as we move into the summer but there some cracks developing in the facade. A pause after a run of several months is normal, particularly with summer slowdowns lying ahead. The tempo is slowing, much like an Adagio following a spirited Allegro symphony movement. Investors should use this interval to tune their positions. Manufacturing and energy have gotten much media attention recently, cloaking possible weakness in the consumer sectors. Retail trade provides jobs for almost 16 million Americans, 11% of the total workforce. Hospitality jobs at restaurants and hotels are similar. These two groups thus comprise 22% of the total workforce while the entire manufacturing sector employs around 12 million, only 9% of the workforce. Consumer confidence levels hit high levels after the elections but a lack of progress in Washington on economic issues is adding risk. Retail and food service sales levels were down in February and March. U.S. GDP growth in the March quarter was an anemic 0.7%, the lowest in three years. The Federal Reserve expressed concerns with this pace and voted this week to leave interest rates unchanged. It commented that it views the slowdown as “transitory” and its next meeting in June will bring sharply focused investor attention. Earnings reports are generally better than expected although market reactions have been inconsistent. Pepsi, Boeing, Proctor & Gamble and Texas Instruments all beat earnings estimates but their stock prices then slipped. Apple (AAPL-$146) briefly set a world record market capitalization of more than $776 billion, beat earning estimates and then disappointed Wall Street with iPhone sales of “only” 50.76 million against estimates of 52 million. Meanwhile, it boosted its dividend 10%, becoming the world’s largest dividend payer. It remains a buy and the largest position in my client portfolios. Auto sales slumped in April, the fourth straight month of sales not reaching expectations, signaling the auto market peaking after seven fat years. Although valuations are quite reasonable, negative trends have a way of getting worse and I sold our positions in General Motors and Magna. Ever developing geopolitical crises, will spur additional defense spending, an announced goal of the Administration. My new buys in the defense sector are General Dynamics (GD-$193) and Northrop Grumman (NOC-$244). GD joins previous buy Huntington Ingalls (HII-$185) with substantial shipbuilding and marine systems for the U.S. Navy. Its Gulfstream division is a leader in business jets and its aerospace sales are soaring. Northrop is also strong in Aerospace and is expanding its cyber security businesses into both government and commercial systems. It is a leading provider of unmanned aircraft, satellites and space systems. Both companies are trading at 19-20 times earnings with expected earnings growth in a 10%-14% range. Each yields around 1.5% with excellent records of consecutive dividend increases. Both companies beat estimates for first-quarter earnings and raised forecasts for full-year earnings. After stumbling through various uncertainties, the economies of Europe are stabilizing and a stable outcome to the French elections would help. Two pharmaceutical companies, Shire (SHPG-$180) and Novo-Nordisk (NVO-$41), beat earnings estimates and raised future guidance. Both previously suffered stock price setbacks, Shire from regulatory approval issues that blocked a merger and Novo from pressures on drug prices. Irish-based Shire (SHPG-$180) will earn around $15 this year, good growth at a very reasonable valuation. Novo’s earnings look flat this year in a $2.15-$2.25 range, heading to $2,40 next year. Stocks bottomed out after the Great Recession ended, a little more than          seven full years ago. That’s a timely signal for a “seventh-inning stretch” to tune stock portfolios, possibly to make some lineup changes. It is not a time for rookies.

It's cramped, it's inconvenient, and it's often the only seats available on flights — particularly if you book at the last minute. In the past, an easy way to ensure you get an aisle or window seat is to book the flight early. However, airlines have figured out that their customers have an almost universal hatred for the middle seat. Not only that, airlines have come to realize that many are actually willing to pay to avoid it. For instance, Delta's cheapest tickets these days fall under its Basic Economy class which only allow passengers to select their seats after checking in — at which point the window and aisle seats are likely to be already gone. This means passengers will have to buy more expensive main cabin tickets in order to select seats at the time of booking. On the other hand, Southwest — which doesn't assign seats — charges passengers $15 for the privilege of boarding early. View photos southwest airlinesMore (Southwest Airlines doesn't assign seats.LM Otero/AP) Although it is impossible to completely rule out the possibility of ending up in the middle seat, there are several ways to avoid it without having to pony up extra dough. First, in spite of the revenue generating fees airlines have come up with, booking early is still the best way to ensure you don't end up sandwiched in the middle. In addition to an increased likelihood of getting an aisle or window seats, booking early will also net you cheaper ticket prices. According to a study by Expedia, the average price of tickets are its lowest 57 days ahead of the flight. Further, the study also showed that those buying tickets more than three weeks in advance on flights within North America can expect to see savings of roughly 43-56%. In fact, savings from cheaper tickets prices may allow you to "splurge" on the fees for aisle or window seats. Boeing 737 Norwegian InteriorMore (Boeing 737 with six-abreast seating.Boeing) Second, the plane used to operate the flight makes a big difference as well. These days, the Boeing 737 and Airbus A320 along with their many derivatives dominate the short-to-medium-range market. Both aircraft are generally configured with six-abreast seating or six seats per row with two sections of three seats divided by a single aisle. This results in two middle seats per row. However, there are ways to reduce the likelihood of ending up in the middle seat by taking flights using planes with fewer or no middle seats on board. Instead of the 737 and A320, look for flights operated by Bombardier C-Series, McDonnell Douglas MD80 series, MD90, and Boeing 717-200 jets. These aircraft feature five-abreast seating in a 3-2 configuration — meaning there is only one middle seat per row. In the US, the MD and 717 aircraft are mostly operated by Delta, American, and Allegiant. However, many of these aircraft are aging and their operators are working quickly to replace them with planes that are newer and have more seats. American is in the process of replacing its MD80 or Super80 aircraft with new Boeing 737s. At the same time, Delta is beginning to retire older MD88s in favor of new Airbus A321s. With that said, Delta's fleet currently features more than 270 MD88, MD90, and 717 jets. Which means they'll be around well into the next decade.  View photos Delta Airlines MD88More Read More (Delta Air Lines MD88.Flickr/Aero Icarus) The Bombardier C-Series is brand new and just entered service with SWISS in July of 2016. Over the next few years, the Canadian jetliner will become a more common sight in airports around the world with Delta, Air Canada, SWISS, and Korean Air as its most well-known operators.  Another option is to take flights operated for the major airlines by regional carriers under names such as Delta Connection, United Express, and American Eagle. These flights are generally operated using regional jets or turboprop airliners. Although they are smaller and more cramped, regional aircraft are generally setup in a 2-2 configuration which means there are no middle seats. For this, look for aircraft such as the Bombardier CRJ, the Q400 turboprop as well as the Embraer ERJ. View photos Delta CRJMore (Delta Connection CRJ regional jet.AP) The Embraer E170 and E190 series is a good 'tweener option. Seating anywhere between 70 to 100 passengers, the E-Jet operates both as a regional airliner and with mainline carriers such as American, Air Canada, Polish LOT, and JetBlue. Like the smaller regional jets, the E-Jet is usually setup in a 2-2 configuration with no middle seats. With Embraer launching a second generation of the E-Jet, expect this to be an option for many years down the road.  Unfortunately for many flyers around the world, the narrow-body airliner fleet in Asia and Europe is a virtual duopoly split between the 737 and the A320-family. As a result, apart from encountering the odd C-Series, E-Jet or 717, passengers will have to fly on a regional jet to avoid six-abreast seating.  View photos Jetblue Embraer E SeriesMore (A JetBlue Embraer E-Jet.Flickr/Bill Abbott) Choosing a flight based on the airplane also works on long-haul international flights. These flights are commonly operated by wide-body, twin-aisle airliners such as the Boeing 777, 787, and Airbus A350 as well as the larger Boeing 747 jumbos and the Airbus A380 superjumbos. These large jets are generally setup with nine or even 10-abreast seating in a 3-3-3 or 3-4-3 configuration with either three or four middle seats per row in coach. For flyers looking to avoid middle seats on long haul flights, there are several types of aircraft they should hone in on. First, Boeing's venerable twin-engine 767 wide-body is still around and can commonly be found with a 2-3-2 configuration. That means there's only one middle seat per row in coach. It should be noted, however, that many of the 767s are pushing 20 years of age and like the MD80/90, airlines are in the process of replacing them with newer models. View photos Airbus A330 neo interiorMore (Airbus A330neo future interior.Airbus) With the 767 on the way out, look for flights operated by the twin-engine Airbus A330 and its discontinued four-engined sibling, the A340. These airliners generally feature eight-abreast seating in a 2-4-2 configuration. As a result, the A330/A340 generally fly with only two middle seats per row in coach. Fortunately, for flyers, the A330 one of the most popular wide-body airliners in the world with about 1,500 examples in operation and is still rolling off Airbus production lines. In fact, the company is currently selling a next generation version called the A330neo.

Follow @davidfickling Facebook Twitter Email Print Share May 4, 2017 4:00 PM EDT AIRBUS SE +1.11 At Closing, May 4th 75.03 EUR BOEING CO/THE -0.32 At Closing, May 4th 183.07 USD Being a Chinese airline can seem pretty sweet. The country's major carriers have what's soon to be the world's biggest aviation market to themselves. Operating costs are often on a par with budget carriers elsewhere. Thanks to their lack of fuel hedges, Chinese airlines have even pocketed an outsized benefit from the slump in oil prices. Sooner or later a tax has to be paid, though -- and in this case, it's got wings. The C919 -- a bid by state-owned Commercial Aircraft Corp. of China Ltd., or Comac, to take on Boeing Co.'s 737 and Airbus SE's A320 in the single-aisle, short-haul jet market -- is scheduled to take its maiden test flight Friday. Buyers are hardly queuing out the door. Follow the Leaders Orders for the Comac C919 trail far behind the market leaders Source: Bloomberg, company order books Airbus has received 5,056 orders for new fuel-efficient variants of its A320 family, while Boeing has 3,714 for the rival 737 MAX range. Comac's backlog of 570 aircraft is barely better than the 360 that Bombardier Inc. has chalked up for its CSeries, another touted 737/A320-killer that's turned into an almost fatal own-goal for its manufacturer. Even that total almost certainly overstates the enthusiasm for the C919 among its prospective customers. Almost all announced so far are Chinese airlines and lessors, which are expected to do their patriotic duty in a project of national importance. The only foreign buyers are Thai airline City Airways Co., which lost its operating certificate last year, and lessor GECAS, whose parent General Electric Co. has a stake in the venture making the C919's engines. Hedging Their Bets The C919's customers seem pretty keen on its Boeing and Airbus rivals, too Source: Company reports, news reports, Airbus and Boeing order books. Note: A320neo family includes A319neo and A321neo. Doesn't include figures for airlines and lessors that are buying the 737 or A320 but not the C919. The composition of the Chinese customers is a little odd, too. About three-quarters of orders are going to leasing companies, compared with about one-fifth for a competitor such as the A320neo. Stick It On My Tab Comac has been raising about as much cash from financing as Airbus -- and far more than Boeing Source: Bloomberg, Gadfly calculations Note: Shows trailing 12-month cash flows from financing. That makes most sense if you consider orders from lessors -- many of them units of state-owned banks -- as a form of soft finance to support the C919's development costs and give comfort to potential lenders. Designing a new plane isn't cheap: Comac has been raising about as much cash from financing as Airbus in recent years, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, but the free cash flow left after operating costs and capital spending has remained in persistently negative territory. Not Free Comac's free cash flow has remained in persistently negative territory Source: Bloomberg, Gadfly calculations Even those heroic levels of spending don't look sufficient to make the C919 competitive. Its aluminum airframe is decades behind the composite structures being used on next-generation Airbus and Boeing planes like the A320neo and 737 MAX, and fuel efficiency is likely to be compromised as a result. Based on a very approximate calculation of the plane's fuel capacity, passenger numbers and maximum range, the longest-range version of the C919 will use about 35 percent more fuel to fly a passenger one kilometer than the A320neo.  Even at a discount price, it would be hard to make those economics stack up in a market suffering from falling passenger yields as China's big three carriers fight for share. Meanwhile, the prospect of getting buyers outside China could be years away. The C919 will need to be issued with type certificates by major air-safety agencies in Europe and the U.S. before it's even allowed to fly to most places outside of China. The European Air Safety Agency has only just started work on that uncertain, often years-long process, Aviation Week reported last month. Eight years after it completed its maiden flight, Comac's smaller ARJ-21 jet received its first foreign type certificate only in December, allowing it a foothold in the mighty aviation market of, um, the Republic of Congo. Countries other than China where Comac's ARJ-21 can fly Republic of Congo Ironically, the C919's weak economics and its shortage of global customers could be the silver lining for the Chinese airlines that will end up flying it. They'll ensure that there's a lot more supply of the aircraft from lessors than demand from carriers. That in turn might drive down the cost of operating leases to levels where even with higher fuel consumption its economics can stack up next to foreign rivals. Of course, that would likely force the lessors to write down their fleets. But in a country with 1.5 trillion yuan ($219 billion) in nonperforming loans, who's going to notice a few impairments on aircraft? This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners. The 737 MAX comes out using about 9.6 percent more fuel on the same calculation, although most analysts argue the Airbus and Boeing planes are roughly level-pegging. Aerospace manufacturers argue endlessly about such comparisons, and it's hard to do perfect apples-to-apples comparisons due to variations in model design and the differences between design capacities and actual usage.

Yes No View Results  Loading ... Follow @LethHerald on twitter By The Canadian Press on May 4, 2017. OTTAWA – A program to buy new planes to replace the CF-18 fighter jets flown by the Royal Canadian Air Force for more than 30 years has become a long and complicated process. Here is a timeline of the effort thus far: 1997: The Liberal government invests $10 million in the U.S.-led Joint Strike Fighter program to develop a new fighter jet. 2000: Upgrades to the existing fleet of CF-18s begin in order to keep them flying until 2020. 2001: Lockheed Martin’s F-35 wins a competition under the Joint Strike Fighter program, beating out Boeing. 2010: The Conservative government announces it will buy 65 F-35s to replace the CF-18s at a cost of $9 billion. The cost estimate and decision to sole source generate controversies for more than two years. 2012: – The auditor general releases report saying the price tag is $10 billion higher than stated. Conservatives freeze the budget and hand the procurement process over to a new secretariat. – A separate Defence Department review later in the year pegs the full cost of owning and operating 65 F-35s through the 2050s at nearly $46 billion. – The National Fighter Procurement Secretariat awards contract to KPMG to review financials for the fighter jet replacement program. – The secretariat begins consulting industry on available options to replace the CF-18. – The Defence Department does its own assessment of the F-35. – An independent panel is also appointed to review fighter jet options. 2014: – Independent panel delivers its report to government. It evaluated several plans but made no recommendation, a decision left to senior bureaucrats. – The recommendation to cabinet is that the F-35 is the right choice. – The Conservative government says it will continue to participate in the Joint Strike Fighter Program to keep all options open until a decision is made on the replacement of the CF-18 fleet. 2015: During the election campaign, the Liberals commit to forgoing the F-35, promising instead to hold an open and transparent competition to find a new plane. After forming government in November 2015, the mandate letter for Defence Minister Sajjan repeats promise to hold a competition, but drops specific language on F-35s. 2016: – Air Force commander Lt.-Gen. Michael Hood tells a Commons committee that Canada has enough fighter jets and a decision on a replacement can wait five years. – Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan says the Air Force is facing a “capability gap,” which he later explains as a shortage of fighter jets to meet Canada’s NATO and Norad commitments. – Hood later tells a Senate committee that after his initial testimony, the Liberal government changed the Air Force’s requirements, which created the shortage of fighter jets. – Sajjan announces a new round of consultations with industry to decide the best path forward. – Canada pays $33 million to stay in the F-35 program. – The Liberal government announces it will enter negotiations with U.S. company Boeing to buy 18 Super Hornets as a stop-gap to make sure the air force has enough fighter jets until a replacement for Canada’s CF-18s can be chosen in about five years. Costs are not disclosed. 2017 – The Liberal government sends a letter to Boeing outlining exactly what Canada needs in the warplanes, when it needs them, and what type of economic benefits Canada expects in return. Boeing is expected to respond by the fall with a plan for meeting those requirements, including the price tag. 000000 000000 Leave a Reply Click here to cancel reply.

Alan Mullen, who has flown airplanes since he was 16 working as a pilot in the navy and even for FedEx, knows just that. "It requires a certain amount of discipline and skill and responsibility, and I just enjoy all of that," Mullen said. Mullen is helping to create the next generation of pilots for Crew Training International Professional Flight Training in Germantown. Experts say worldwide airline use went up six percent last year. In order to meet the demand, Boeing estimates there will be a need for more than 600,000 new pilots over the next twenty years. "If learning to be a pilot and developing the experience you need took a month, it would be possible, but it takes a year," Mullen said. Once you complete that training and the hundreds of hours of required flight time, you can make good money. Alan says a starting salary is between $40,000 and $70,000. That's in addition to bonuses that sometimes top $20,000. The reason is mainly the shortage of qualified candidates "It's like going to the NFL Draft and there's only three tight ends and you're one of them," Mullen said. "We need more tight ends than that." It's an exciting career that can allow you to travel around the world while getting well paid in the process. Copyright 2017 WMC Action News 5.

Skip to Navigation St. Louis Review Search: Archdiocese of Saint Louis Twitter Facebook RSS Pastor as CEO • Course gives priests key business principles to lead parishes Submitted on May 04, 2017 By Dave Luecking | daveluecking@archstl.org | twitter: @legacyCatholic Fr. Foy It had been quite a few years since Father Timothy Foy studied business: 17, to be exact. "Fundamentals In Accounting, at St. Louis University in 2000," he said. "It had been a long time." As an aerospace engineer — he later worked for Boeing — he focused his energy elsewhere. Then, after entering Kenrick-Glennon Seminary, his focus clearly wasn't on accounting. Who goes to seminary to learn about business? "That isn't the general inspiration," he quipped. So, Father Foy signed on when the archdiocese, through a partnership between the Shared Accounting Office and the business school at SLU, offered priests a class in business — Understanding & Applying Finance — through the archdiocesan Pastoral Institute of Leadership. For eight weeks, Father Foy and 11 brother priests studied specifics related to their parishes finances, in three classroom sessions, and general business principles, in five online sessions. Most of the student priests came from the ranks of associate pastors on the road to becoming pastors in the next few years, though a few such as Father Foy already lead parishes. Father Foy and Father David Skillman are parochial administrators at St. John the Baptist "Gildehaus" in Villa Ridge St Gerard Majella Parish in Kirkwood, respectively. Father Mitch Doyen, the pastor at Assumption Parish in O'Fallon, also took the class as a refresher; he has moved back into parish ministry after seven years as president at St. Mary's High School. In the course, they learned accounting terminology, accounting for nonprofits, financial statement analysis, budgeting and more. Father Foy and his compatriots universally praised the course for dealing specifically with numbers associated with their parishes, giving them real-world experience "rather than just seeing general accounting principles," he said. "Getting a little bit of background about how the bookkeeping works in a parish and how you plan budgets ... was beneficial for us; it was put together very well," said Father Skillman, whose associate, Father Raymond Buehler, also took the class. When the course began in mid-January, Father Foy was just starting his assignment at Gildehaus, sitting in for the first time at meetings dealing with parish and school finances. "I'm still growing in my knowledge of all these things, but (the class) was a helpful overview ... to get basic principles," he said. "For instance, budgets are not supposed to be a one-person project; it's an iterative process between different groups of what they're planning." Having a background in finance and business helps a pastor or administrator stay connected with a parish. "If a priest has no interest in the financial aspects of the parish, if he's not living at all with the realities of looking at the budget, he's going to be disconnected from what people are going through and what the parish is doing," he said. "While you're not supposed to be spending all day looking at Quick Books, it is an important thing." Especially in this day and age. With fewer priests to serve in parishes, priests are becoming pastors five or six years after ordination, rather than 12 years or more back in the day. Then, once they become pastors, they have fewer, if any, associates to share the busy calendar of daily and Sunday Masses, confessions, baptisms, sacramental emergencies — the main focus of pastoral ministry. "This is an opportunity not to make them experts but to give them a nice little foundation so they can be involved in their parishes," said Jerry Amsler, the director of shared accounting. Amsler developed the course as a result of being "out and about, working with pastors who asked for guidance and help. A lot of people were raising their hands." Initially, Amsler figured a priest-business program would already exist somewhere, and he'd build a program around that for the archdiocese. However, such a program didn't exist, so he sought help from SLU and business professor Neil Jansen helped develop the program. Feedback from the first group of student priests was universally positive. "They say, 'I feel I'm in the conversation now at the parish instead of around the conversation,'" Amsler said. "That's really powerful."  Pastoral Institute of Leadership In partnership with St. Louis University, the archdiocesan Shared Accounting Office is offering an eight-week business class from priests in the Archdiocese of St. Louis. The course, "Understanding & Applying Finances," is geared toward associate pastors, priests a few years out of seminary and in the pastor pipeline, but it also serves as a refresher for priests already serving as pastors. The class deals with financial statements, budgeting, decision-making and more. The first eight-week class concluded in spring, but two more will be offered later this year. Classes in other areas, such human resources, marketing, managing a school site and operations, as well as a capstone project introduction to a parish, are planned but not yet finalized. For more information, priests should call Jerry Amsler in the Shared Accounting Office at (314) 792-7111 or email at JerryAmsler@archstl.org.  Bookmark/Search this post with Average: Select ratingPoorOkayGoodGreatAwesome No votes yet Tweet Local News Parishes business business principles class course kenrick glennon seminary parishes pastoral institute of leadership priests Printer-friendly version Send to friend Related Articles A life of service in Christ: New leadership core at Kenrick-Glennon Seminary has a passion for vocations and formation Archbishop announces change in seminary leadership Sioux Falls priest named directorof seminary's spiritual formation Parishes respond generously to seminary campaign Kenrick-Glennon classes to show links of science, theology Most Emailed Stories POPE'S MESSAGE | Peace isn't mass-produced but handcrafted by ordinary people Divine Word priest, a 'true crusader' builds up Downtown parish 'Sluggers' group faithful in commitment to Joplin residents News » All Local Multimedia » Multimedia Slideshows Photo Galleries Reviewcast Education Sports Obituaries STLsisters Special Sections » All Senior Living Christian Hope Jubilarians Nation/World Pope Francis Virtual Vestibule » #GenLifeSTL blog One Church, One Home Heavenly Hoops blog Pop Culture Catholic blog Reviewcast blog The Ambo blog The Newsroom blog Lumen blog Year of Mercy Living Our Faith Church Teaching » All Archbishop's Column Sunday Scripture Dear Father Opinion » All Editorials Viewpoints Letters to the Editor Event/Job postings » Current events Employment Education » Cache Statistics Engage #catholicstl Tweets News and Articles Local News Nation and World News Editorials Living Our Faith Calendar News Archive About the Review General information Advertising Story commenting guidelines Employment Classifieds Staff Subscribe Archdiocese of St. Louis Home Page Online Giving Parishes Schools Quick Links Virtual Vestibule blog Contact the St. Louis Review St. Louis Review 20 Archbishop May Dr. St Louis, MO 63119 314-792-7500 All content copyright © 2017 St. Louis Review.

Here, the jet, has its first high-speed taxi test in Shanghai. SHANGHAI—China is expected to pass a technology milestone on Friday with the maiden flight of its first big commercial airliner, launching what Beijing hopes will become a rival to Boeing Co. BA, -0.17%  and Airbus SE AIR, +1.50%  . If the flight goes off as planned, and weather permitting, the C919 will be the latest breakthrough for China as it races to upgrade its advanced industrial capacity in sectors including robotics, computer chips, electric cars and renewable energy. Getting airborne is one thing. Soaring in the fiercely competitive commercial-aviation market is a far tougher proposition, aviation analysts say. But with a reported $317 billion set aside to bankroll advanced manufacturing projects, China seems to care less about returns from costly experiments like the C919 than about securing a foothold in high-value industries dominated by foreign players. “Basically, they can deliver jets if they’re willing to lose a lot of money,” Richard Aboulafia, vice president at Teal Group Corp., a U.S.-based aerospace intelligence company.

The single-aisle, twin-engine C919 ‘Made in China’ which can seat up to 168 passengers was shown to a large crowd of government dignitaries and other guests, about 4,000 in numbers, in a hangar at an assembly plant outside Shanghai, near Pudong International Airport on Monday. “China’s air transport industry cannot completely rely on imports,” China’s civil aviation chief, Li Jiaxiang told the crowd. “A great nation must have its own large commercial aircraft,” he is quoted by BBC as saying. The passenger jet will undergo testing over the next year or so and won’t be ready for delivery until 2018. China is one of the biggest aviation markets in the world but relies on Boeing and Airbus aircraft. The manufacture of C919 is aimed at prevent some of the country’s commercial benefits going to other countries. The first customers of C919 are expected to be Chinese airlines with the manufacturing company Comac saying it has received orders from 21 customers for a total of 517 aircraft, mostly from Chinese carriers but also from GE Capital Aviation Services.

WHAT ELSE HAPPENED IN 1953? The Queen may have had her Coronation in 1953 but that isn't the only dramatic event to take place as we reveal Floods on the east coast of England caused the deaths of more than 300 people as the Queen spent most of February visiting stricken areas At the start of 1953, Britain remained in the grip of post-war greyness with Winston Churchill still at the helm of the country as PM. There was even still rationing for sausages, sugar and eggs Dwight D.Eisenhower inaugurated as president of the US after defeating Democrat Adlai Stevenson Sir Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay become the first people to successfully climb to the summit of Mount Everest British physicist Francis Crick and American biologist James Watson discover the double-helix structure of human DNA Nikita Khrushchev wins power struggle in Soviet Union after the death of Josef Stalin First clear evidence linking lung cancer to cigarette smoking Blockbusters Roman Holiday and From Here to Eternity released on screen 1953 also saw smash hits (How Much Is) That Doggie in the Window by Lita Roza and Stargazers’ Broken Wings released in the charts Dwight D. Eisenhower was inaugurated as the United States president during January of 1953 and in August the Soviet Union announced it had tested its own hydrogen bomb – increasing Cold War tensions between the USSR and the US. The global superpower standoff had been ongoing for five years and would continue for another 38. In 1953 a pint of milk would set Brits back 2.9p and a loaf of bread cost 10p – a price that has risen by more than 3,900 per cent. The first stop on the tour was to Bermuda in November on the Queen’s first ever visit to the country. The couple arrived on a Boeing 377 called Canopus – the same plane that would bring PM Winston Churchill to the country a week later.

Accompanied by Governor Alexander Hood and his wife, Philip and the Queen visited St Peter’s Church, toured Kindley Air Force base and paraded through Hamilton before paying a visit to Parliament. The couple then travelled to Jamaica where they boarded SS Gothic, which was to be used as the Royal yacht for the remainder of the tour. After whirlwind tours of Fiji and Tonga, the pair docked in New Zealand on December 23 for a stay of over a month. Times Newspapers Ltd 10 Prince Philip and the Queen spent over a month visiting New Zealand on the tour Times Newspapers Ltd 10 Prince Philip and the Queen in New Zealand where they visited 46 towns and cities The lengthy stay saw Philip and the Queen visit 46 towns and cities and attend 110 separate functions. They spent Christmas in Auckland with a morning in church before the Queen made her first ever broadcast. New Year’s Eve saw the couple travel by air to Wellington for a funeral for the victims of the Tangiwai railway accident that killed 151 people before travelling to the famous glow worm caves in Waitomo. The pair left New Zealand on the SS Gothic on January 30 and embarked on a two-month tour of Australia where they reportedly travelled an average of 230 miles a day carrying out Royal duties. During their 58 days in the country they visited 57 cities and towns across all states and territories. They arrived in Sydney on the royal yacht on February 3, 1954 – the first time the Queen had set foot on Australian soil. Getty Images 10 The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh wave to a crowd of children in New South Wales, Australia, in February 1954 It was the biggest single event ever organised in Australia with 75 per cent of the population turning out to catch a glimpse of the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh. The couple’s return journey saw them visit Ceylon, Aden, Uganda and Malta where the couple were reunited with their children Prince Charles and Princess Anne. They then sailed via Gibraltar to London on the new Royal Yacht Britannia. On May 10, 1954, thousands flocked to the bank of the River Thames to see Philip and the Queen return to the UK. Planet News Ltd 10 Prince Philip and the Queen travelled to Malta where they were reunited with their two children in May 1954 Planet News 10 The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh visit the Barbary apes before leaving Gibraltar They were joined by the Prime Minister, Sir Winston Churchill, who stayed on the yacht on the last night at the Queen’s invitation after boarding at Yarmouth on the Isle of Wight. Once the Britannia had moored the Queen Mother and Princess Margaret joined the royal party on board the yacht’s barge for their onward journey to Westminster. As they left there was a 41-gun salute from the Tower of London. When the couple arrived back at Buckingham Palace they made four more appearances to the delight of gathered crowds. It was only after their last appearance on the iconic balcony of the royal residence at 11pm that the crowd finally left when lamps floodlighting the palace were switched off.

The Catalan festival, originally St Jordi’s Day, is celebrated on the 23rd of April every year with locals gifting roses and books to one another. Earlier this year, Emirates SkyCargo unveiled the rose decal on the Boeing 777F aircraft in Dubai on Valentine’s day. The decal which was the first of its kind for Emirates SkyCargo highlights the carrier’s contribution to the global floriculture industry by transporting fresh flowers across the world. In 2016, Emirates SkyCargo transported over 70,000 tonnes of fresh flowers including roses across its network of over 150 destinations across six continents. Rosie’s journey In the two months since the installation of the rose decal, Rosie has been playing her part in facilitating global trade. During this time the aircraft has travelled around the world to over 35 cities in 25 countries across six continents ranging from Australia to the United States. Rosie has also carried over 7,000 tonnes of cargo ranging from general cargo to perishables and even horses. True to her name Rosie has also transported over 550 tonnes of roses over multiple flights between Nairobi in Kenya, Quito in Ecuador to the global flower hub in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. Barcelona Freighter Operations Emirates SkyCargo has been operating a weekly freighter service to Barcelona since March 2016. This service enables the carrier to move large volumes of exports out of Barcelona to other global destinations. Notable exports carried by Emirates SkyCargo from Barcelona include fashion garments, perfumery products, electrical and mechanical products and pharmaceuticals. The freighter allows for customers in Barcelona and the surrounding regions to transport outsized, heavy or unusual cargo that may not fit in the belly hold of the passenger aircraft. In addition to the freighter, Emirates SkyCargo offers customers cargo capacity on its twice daily passenger aircraft to the city. Emirates SkyCargo is at the forefront of the air cargo industry and operates a modern fleet of 15 aircraft -13 Boeing 777-F and two Boeing 747-400ERFs. In addition to state of the art facilities at its cargo hubs in Dubai, the carrier also offers specialized transportation solutions for the food, pharmaceutical and automotive industries.

The British aircraft engine maker, which repatriates profits made in foreign currencies from overseas businesses, has benefited from the slide of the pound since the Brexit vote in June 2016. The currency effect could boost sales by 400 million pounds ($517 million) and pre-tax profit by GBP50 million, the company said in a trading update ahead of its annual shareholder meeting. The company, which supplies aircraft engines for Boeing Co. and Airbus SE airliners, stuck to its full-year guidance for slightly better sales, and cash flow similar to last year's level. As in 2016, the company expects little profit in the first half of the year, with the bulk generated in the last six months. Chief Executive Officer Warren East, who has been trying to streamline the company and boost profitability, said progress had been good but "more needs to be done to ensure we drive sustainable margin improvements within the business." Rolls-Royce settled a long-running corruption probe in January, pleading guilty to wrongdoing in business activity over several decades. Rolls-Royce has agreed to pay more than $800 million in fines, in deals with U.S., British and Brazilian corruption watchdogs.

(Andy Bronson / The Herald) Aerospace blog Aerospace suppliers spending huge sums to boost capacity Dan Catchpole Thu May 4th, 2017 7:13am BusinessNews You must sign in or register to continue reading content. LAKE STEVENS — The shop floor at Cobalt Enterprises in Lake Stevens is abuzz with activity as half-million-dollar machine tools turn metal blocks into airplane parts. The company has expanded at breakneck speed in recent years — consistently growing for several years until 2016, when it doubled in size. The aerospace supplier expects to do about $25 million in sales this year. With airplane makers cranking up production and military spending on the rise, there is plenty of work for Cobalt and other aerospace suppliers. To win it, suppliers are under intense pressure to keep costs down, quality high and deliveries on time. Companies across Snohomish County are spending huge sums to add production capacity in recent years. Boeing has spent more than $1 billion to set up 777X production and assembly work at its Everett plant. Over the past five years, Cobalt Enterprises has spent up to $15 million on getting bigger and better, co-owner Paul Clark said. Last year, Cobalt opened a bigger machine shop in Lake Stevens, while keeping its Granite Falls location. Later in the year, it added an Everett plant when it took over Integrated Aerospace Manufacturing, which itself sprang from a 2015 merger of three local suppliers — Vector Industries, Polaris Machining and Quality Manufacturing. Cobalt focuses on making relatively smaller batches of intricate pieces — a high-skill, small-run niche. “We do the work that others don’t want to take on or can’t do,” Clark said. Commercial aerospace makes up about 60 percent of its work, military and space takes up another 30 percent and non-aerospace work is about 10 percent. It currently is making parts for a new football helmet designed to cut down on concussions, made by Seattle-based VICIS. Cobalt typically makes parts for other, bigger aerospace suppliers. Its customers have wanted more finished parts, he said. Larger suppliers “want more packaged or kitted parts,” rather than pieces that have to be assembled. Adding production capabilities and doing more assembly work has made Cobalt more competitive. Also, “by being larger, you might have a better chance to hold onto work that might shift otherwise,” Clark said. Taking over Integrated Aerospace Machining gave Cobalt new capabilities, such as stretch forming aluminum — a production process that uses powerful machines to pull and push the metal into shapes. In Lynnwood, Crane Aerospace & Electronics added industry-leading test and production operations for its fuel flow meters, which track the amount of fuel going to a jet engine. The meters already are in many of the major engines in production, including the CFM International LEAP engines used on Boeing’s 737 MAX, Airbus’ A320neo and Comac’s C919. The expanded plant, which is expected to start production later this year, will ensure the company keeps pace with production schedules and that its products get on new engines being developed in the years ahead, said Dave Dickson, a marketing executive for Crane Aerospace & Electronics. Like many aerospace investments in the region, Crane’s expansion was less about adding workers and more about increasing capabilities to win future work. The company still employs about 800 people in Lynnwood, about as many as it did when it broke ground on the expansion in late 2015. Many suppliers are investing huge sums to get more efficient and competitive. Esterline extensively overhauled its Korry Electronics plant near Paine Field in 2015 to create a factory based on the principles of lean manufacturing, an organizational approach that stresses flexibility, responsiveness and efficiency. Last year, B/E Aerospace finished moving its operations around Snohomish County into a new factory that opened near Paine Field in 2013. Zodiac Northwest Aerospace Technologies plans to move later this year from its home near downtown Everett to a new plant in an industrial park on the city’s east side along the Snohomish River. The company confirmed the move, but would not comment on details.

Source: Shutterstock Passengers that fly in American Airlines Group Inc’s economy class will be the ones facing less legroom. The economy class will have three rows on the flight dropping from 31 inches of legroom to 29 inches. Other passengers in American Airlines Group Inc’s economy class will also see their legroom decrease. Instead of the drop to 29 inches, these seats will reduce legroom from 31 inches to 30 inches. These changes are coming to the airline’s new 737 Max jets from Boeing Co (NYSE:BA). The seats with less legroom won’t cost less than other economy seats. American Airlines Group Inc is reducing legroom in its economy class to fit more seats on its jets. This will allow it to have more than 170 seats on each flight. Current flights offer 160 seats. The changes won’t affect its main cabin economy seats or its first class ones. The changes will also reportedly include a smaller bathroom, reports CNNMoney. American Airlines Group Inc’s changes are parts of its efforts to better compete with cheaper airlines, such as Spirit Airlines Incorporated (NASDAQ:SAVE). The changes also make sense as Americans aren’t interested in paying more for extra conveniences. A study from 2016 found that only 21% of Americans would pay extra for more benefits while flying.

Friedman: “Is this a political strategy unfolding or a psychiatric condition unfolding?” Olivier Douliery TNS Syndicated Columnists May 03, 2017 8:30 PM Thomas L. Friedman: Is Trump crazy like a fox, or is he just crazy? By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN New York Times News Service LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story Has the first 100 days of the presidency made Donald Trump nuts? I don’t ask that question as a doctor. I don’t do medical diagnoses. I ask it as a newspaper reader. You read all of Trump’s 100-day interviews and they are just bizarre. Out of nowhere Trump tells us he would be “honored” to negotiate directly with the leader of North Korea, after weeks of threatening war. Out of nowhere he says he would consider a gasoline tax to pay for infrastructure. Out of nowhere he says he is considering breaking up the nation’s biggest banks. He also insists that his Obamacare replacement legislation contains protections for people with pre-existing conditions that it doesn’t. There’s barely a dictator in the world for whom he doesn’t have praise. And he repeats a known falsehood — that Barack Obama wiretapped him — and tells reporters they should go find the truth, when, as president, he could get the truth from the FBI with one phone call, and when pressed whether he stands by that allegation, answers, “I don’t stand by anything.” Is this a political strategy unfolding or a psychiatric condition unfolding? I don’t know — but it tells me that absolutely anything is possible in the next 100 days — both good and bad. Trump is clearly capable of shifting gears and striking any deal with any party on any issue. Trump was always going to be an unpredictable work in progress because he did no homework before coming to office — which is why he now tells us that he’s finding so many problems more difficult than he anticipated — and because he didn’t know most of his Cabinet members. They’re sort of a pickup basketball team, bound not by a shared vision but by a shared willingness to overlook Trump’s core ignorance, instability and indecency and serve in key jobs as much to restrain him as to be guided by him. Allies and adversaries saved Trump and the country from some of his most extreme, ill-considered campaign promises. His foreign policy team stopped him from tearing up the Iran nuclear deal and moving the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. North Korea’s missile-loving dictator saved him from declaring China a currency manipulator and starting a trade war with Beijing, because Trump discovered he needed China to restrain North Korea and avoid a war. Boeing and General Electric restrained Trump from getting rid of the Export-Import Bank, which would have left U.S. exporters at a big disadvantage. The federal courts prevented him from imposing his Muslim ban. Border-state Republicans blocked his Mexico wall. U.S. farmers, whose exports to Mexico have soared since NAFTA was signed, dissuaded him from walking out of that trade deal. As for the next 100 days, who will protect us? Myself, I am not counting on the Democratic Party. It’s too weak. On the issues I care about most, I’m actually counting on California. I believe California’s market size, aspirational goals and ability to legislate make it the most powerful opposition party to Trump in America today. How so? Trump wants to scrap Obama-era standards requiring passenger cars to average about 51 mpg by 2025; today it’s just under 37 mpg. But as the Los Angeles Times recently noted, under the Clean Air Act, California “can impose emissions standards stronger than those set by the federal government, and a dozen other states have embraced the California rules.” More than one-third of the vehicles sold in the United States are subject to the rules California sets. Trump can deregulate U.S. automakers to make more gas guzzlers all he wants, but they can’t if they want to sell cars in California. Trump can sue, but that will take years. California has far more clean energy jobs than there are coal jobs in all of America, and California’s now nation-leading growth rate in jobs gives the lie to everything Trump says: You can have gradually rising clean energy standards, innovation, job creation and GDP growth — all at the same time. “We have made it very clear — we will protect our economic prosperity and our values from Trump,” said state Senate leader Kevin de León, whose Legislature recently hired former Attorney General Eric Holder to defend it against Trump suits. Holder is California’s (and my) secretary of defense.

Thursday, May 4, 2017 Search Archive Chinese Chinese Japanese French Spanish Russian Arabic Korea German Portuguese HomeOpinionsBusinessMilitaryWorldSocietyCultureTravelScienceSportsSpecial CoveragePhotoVideo English>> Homemade passenger jet set for 1st flight By Zhu Wenqian (China Daily)    08:49, May 04, 2017 Two technicians inspect an engine on the C919, China's first domestically produced single-aisle passenger jet, after a taxiing test on Wednesday.[Photo by Yin Liqin/China Daily] China's first domestically produced single-aisle passenger jet, the C919, is expected to take to the sky for its maiden flight on Friday, as the country endeavors to meet soaring domestic travel demand and break the global market duopoly of Boeing Co and Airbus Group SE. The debut flight is set to take place at Shanghai Pudong International Airport, subject to weather conditions, the C919's Shanghai-based manufacturer, Commercial Aircraft Corp of China, said on Wednesday. Soon after it was established in 2008, COMAC began the research to develop the twin-engine C919, which would be used for medium-haul flights with 158 to 174 seats. It is expected to compete with the updated Airbus A320 and the new-generation Boeing B737. China has its own military and regional aircraft manufacturers, and the development of the airplane serves as a key index to assess the country's industrial and technical manufacturing capacity. "The first flight of the C919 signals that China will be able to make a significant breakthrough for the country's civil aircraft manufacturing industry, and it could have the opportunity to break the monopolies of Boeing and Airbus," said Lin Zhijie, an aviation industry analyst and columnist at Carnoc.com, a large Chinese civil aviation website. Despite the promising future, Lin said the C919's entry to the market won't occur soon. The date it goes into operation is expected to be between 2020 and 2022. So far, COMAC has received 570 orders for the C919 from 23 clients, including domestic airlines such as the State-owned Air China, China Southern and China Eastern; and private airlines Hainan Airlines and Sichuan Airlines. China Eastern will be the first to take delivery. Overseas orders account for about 10 percent of the total, including airlines from Germany and Thailand and others from the Asia Pacific region and Africa. Boeing earlier predicts that China will need 5,110 new single-aisle airplanes through 2035, accounting for 75 percent of the total delivery for China from global aircraft manufacturers. "While the program has faced its share of challenges－like any development program of this size－the results speak for themselves," said Steven Lien, president of Honeywell Aerospace Asia Pacific, one of the C919's suppliers. "The C919 is a sleek, modern and efficient airplane. It is ready to compete on a global scale, heralding China's ambitious plans to grow and develop its domestic air transportation industry with the help of international partners." COMAC said last week it has started the research to develop a widebody commercial jet with Russia for delivery within 10 years.

The review took 32 months to complete, caused considerable angst and frustration in industry, contains nothing about improving CAA efficiency, and results in $2m less revenue for the regulator over three years. ‘Where is the business sense in that’ asked Nicholson. While shifting more costs onto the General Aviation sector, CAA has made small changes to passenger safety levies (domestic levy down by 11 cents per passenger, ANZA levy up 2 cents and international levy up 30 cents) and reduced the medical certification fee paid by individual pilots. There is some irony in the medical fee falling from $272.17 (GST excl) to $105 (GST excl). When the medical fee was introduced CAA said that it covered all medical certification processing and system management fees (its own costs). Now CAA seems to be saying that some of these costs should be paid by companies instead. CAA suggests that by shifting cost onto the General Aviation sector that all participants in the aviation system will pay a fairer share of safety oversight, the approach provides a real financial incentive to meet safety standards, but accepts that some operators could pay significantly more. In reality this means that CAA will guarantee future income streams for itself through a safety levy and continue to charge companies at its $246 (plus GST) hourly rate for certification, exposition and exemption work. The new levies mean that companies could pay CAA up to $60,000 more a year with no undertakings on the calibre of service to be provided. CAA currently recognises the safety performance of the companies that will bear the brunt of the increases through the costs they pay for inspections and audits, identifies them in its risk profiles as lower risk and has approved many of them as training organisations. Agricultural companies for example are now paying reduced ACC rates because of their exemplary safety performance. Why should these companies pay CAA so much more? In the freight area, CAA has determined that some companies won’t have to pay freight levies but others will. CAA also comments that General Aviation operators with low levels of activity will pay less than they currently do. This is the group that CAA has previously recognised as posing the greatest threat to aviation safety. In future, CAA’s oversight of these companies will be subsidised by the larger companies. ‘There are surprising omissions in the outcome of the CAA funding review too’ said Nicholson. CAA gives no indication of how it will improve efficiency, and no insights as to how the funding review process will be improved for 2019 onwards. We have some ideas on both counts and will be talking to CAA about them. ‘While some aviation companies are in contractual relationships with customers, we are advising them to pass on these extra CAA charges from 1 July and call them a compulsory CAA safety tax’, said Nicholson. However, given CAA’s financial position ($22.2m reserves at 30 June 2016 cf $21.2m the previous year), our preference is that the medical fee be reduced but that other charges/levy rates be left as they are and that CAA works with a small group of industry experts to develop an open and transparent funding/efficiency model for implementation on 1 July 2019.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 5 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman CAA Funding Review Friday, 5 May 2017, 3:49 pm Press Release: Aviation New Zealand CAA Funding Review ‘The just completed CAA funding review, which sees substantial cost increases for many General Aviation operators,’ is a major disappointment said Aviation NZ Chief Executive John Nicholson. The review took 32 months to complete, caused considerable angst and frustration in industry, contains nothing about improving CAA efficiency, and results in $2m less revenue for the regulator over three years. ‘Where is the business sense in that’ asked Nicholson. While shifting more costs onto the General Aviation sector, CAA has made small changes to passenger safety levies (domestic levy down by 11 cents per passenger, ANZA levy up 2 cents and international levy up 30 cents) and reduced the medical certification fee paid by individual pilots. There is some irony in the medical fee falling from $272.17 (GST excl) to $105 (GST excl). When the medical fee was introduced CAA said that it covered all medical certification processing and system management fees (its own costs). Now CAA seems to be saying that some of these costs should be paid by companies instead. CAA suggests that by shifting cost onto the General Aviation sector that all participants in the aviation system will pay a fairer share of safety oversight, the approach provides a real financial incentive to meet safety standards, but accepts that some operators could pay significantly more. In reality this means that CAA will guarantee future income streams for itself through a safety levy and continue to charge companies at its $246 (plus GST) hourly rate for certification, exposition and exemption work. The new levies mean that companies could pay CAA up to $60,000 more a year with no undertakings on the calibre of service to be provided. CAA currently recognises the safety performance of the companies that will bear the brunt of the increases through the costs they pay for inspections and audits, identifies them in its risk profiles as lower risk and has approved many of them as training organisations. Agricultural companies for example are now paying reduced ACC rates because of their exemplary safety performance. Why should these companies pay CAA so much more? In the freight area, CAA has determined that some companies won’t have to pay freight levies but others will. CAA also comments that General Aviation operators with low levels of activity will pay less than they currently do. This is the group that CAA has previously recognised as posing the greatest threat to aviation safety. In future, CAA’s oversight of these companies will be subsidised by the larger companies. ‘There are surprising omissions in the outcome of the CAA funding review too’ said Nicholson. CAA gives no indication of how it will improve efficiency, and no insights as to how the funding review process will be improved for 2019 onwards. We have some ideas on both counts and will be talking to CAA about them. ‘While some aviation companies are in contractual relationships with customers, we are advising them to pass on these extra CAA charges from 1 July and call them a compulsory CAA safety tax’, said Nicholson. However, given CAA’s financial position ($22.2m reserves at 30 June 2016 cf $21.2m the previous year), our preference is that the medical fee be reduced but that other charges/levy rates be left as they are and that CAA works with a small group of industry experts to develop an open and transparent funding/efficiency model for implementation on 1 July 2019. General Aviation (GA) GA is the backbone of the New Zealand aviation industry. It covers commercial and private operators involved in agricultural operations, tourism, charter operations, search and rescue, fire fighting and industrial (power line surveillance and repairs, heavy lifts, offshore supply) and training. It excludes the commercial airlines. There are about 2700 aircraft in the GA fleet made up of over 1950 fixed wing aircraft and 849 helicopters. Key facts about Aviation New Zealand Aviation New Zealand exists to lead, inspire and grow the New Zealand aviation industry. It was established in 1950 to encourage the safe growth of the aviation industry in New Zealand. In more recent years, it has also become involved in helping the international development of its members. o Aviation New Zealand has over 260 members and over 1500 on its database o Members include agricultural companies, air operators (fixed wing and rotary), aircraft designers and manufacturers, the UAV industry, airports, aviation trainers, emergency and medical services companies, helicopter companies, and parts manufacturers. Key facts about aviation in New Zealand An ‘early adopter’ in aviation terms – first international customer for Boeing; first pilot training school 1916; first airmail 1919; and quick appreciation of the suitability of aviation for agriculture, tourism and forestry. Over 4500 aircraft in New Zealand, one per thousand people, give New Zealand one of the highest aircraft per capita ratios in the world. The industry exports to over 100 countries on all continents including Antarctica – we have proven success companies are highly regarded internationally for their quality, responsiveness and practicality – this makes us different to many of our competitors decades of policy innovation in New Zealand support competition, safety and growth – our local business environment is much better than that in many countries we do business with 30m km² of safely managed airspace – our systems and processes are scalable Aircraft fit-outs, new aircraft (including UAVs), GPS track and tracing systems, high precision processes (for example bait and fire fighting), composites, titanium powders, and aviation industry business and operational systems are just some of the exciting technologies and practices developing in New Zealand which set the scene for growth in the next 100 years. © Scoop Media CategoriesUncategorized TagsUncategorized Post navigation Previous PostPrevious Non-Halogenated Flame Retardants Market is projected to expand at a CAGR of 6.4% during the forecast period Next PostNext Business Update Search Recent Posts How communicators can prepare for the challenges ahead of them Ceramic Tiles Market to reach US$ 112.3 Bn in revenues by 2019 end Global Stamping Fasteners Market Professional Survey Report 2017 Red Berries Market revenues projected to reach US$ 24.9 Mn by 2026 Magnesium Oxide Market is anticipated to increase at a CAGR of 4.1% over 2016–2026 RSS RSS Feed Proudly powered by WordPress

UK Export Finance, which provides payment guarantees on cross-border deals, is said to be considering underwriting part of the sale to Iran Air. The airline plans to buy 180 commercial jets from Boeing and Airbus but has struggled to secure financing to complete the deal despite sanctions against the country being relaxed in 2015 in return for restrictions on its nuclear programme. Although the nuclear deal has led to some re-engagement by western businesses, banks have been reluctant to work with the regime for fear of falling foul of regulations.

Photo by Robert Cohen, rcohen@post-dispatch.com VALLEY PARK • The high water that enveloped communities along the Meramec River had begun to recede Thursday, but authorities remained cautious about moving back into hard-hit areas. Valley Park Mayor Michael A. Pennise sent a letter to residents and business owners Thursday afternoon, saying a mandatory evacuation that went into effect Tuesday will be lifted at 8 a.m. Friday. But he advised the city will continue to monitor a secondary crest that’s expected on the Meramec after this week’s rain. “Please exercise caution in the levee protected areas as city maintenance crews are still working to pump some storm water levee detention basins,” Pennise said. “For the business owners affected south of the Meramec River, the city asks you to respect them by not driving in the immediate area while they clean up and recover after this flooding event.” Crews are clearing roads of debris to get them reopened, the mayor said. The river crested in Valley Park at 43.31 feet early Wednesday. It had dropped below 36 feet by Thursday night. After a second crest on Sunday at about 32 feet, the river was forecast to drop to 12 feet there by next Thursday, illustrating how quickly the Meramec can swell and shrink. ‘Better than last time’ In downtown Eureka, several businesses had started cleaning up the water damage. But the sandbags will remain, said Don Tomnitz, assistant chief with the Eureka Fire Protection District. Scott Barthelmass of the Eureka Fire Department said the concern isn’t more flooding, but rather safety with respect to the continuing rain. Removing the sandbags can wait. The river was at 34.5 feet late Thursday after cresting at 46.11 feet Tuesday night. The river was expected to continue dropping. Still, a second, smaller crest is expected over the weekend. That crest was forecast at about 34 feet. The levels of damage varied greatly. Chick-n-Elly’s fried chicken restaurant did not take in any water. The owners hope to open on Saturday. The office of Shelter Insurance agent Steve Parker got 41 inches of water. When the flood happened in December 2015, he was away on vacation and came back to find everything damaged. This time, employees were able to move the furniture and other items out of harm’s way, leaving the damage primarily to the carpet, which was being torn out Thursday morning. At St. Francis’ Episcopal Church, workers were cutting away drywall and rolling out carpet soaked by water that rose to 4 feet. All the items at ground level had been moved to safety prior to the flood. Across the region, schools and roads remained closed as floodwater continued making commutes near the river a challenge. However, both lanes of Interstate 55 running through Jefferson County were open. In Arnold, residents were praising city leaders and utility companies for being better prepared than when floods pummeled the area 16 months ago. Michael Doutre, of the 2300 block of Boeing Drive, said that in December 2015 water filled his basement and made its way into the main level of the house. This go-around, three pumps running in his basement kept the water out of the rest of the house. “This is a whole lot better than last time,” Doutre said as he and neighbors cleaned up. Because authorities did a better job of predicting the flood and warning residents it was coming, Doutre said he was able to move furniture and other items into a neighbor’s house where high water was not expected. The added time allowed neighbors to build sandbag walls and get pumps in place. But flood damage twice within two years was too much for some residents. “Every 500 year flood? Shouldn’t it be like every 15 month flood?” said Keith Roeder, who lives on Electra Drive with his wife, Stacy Robinson. Three weeks ago, they had finally finished basement repairs from the December 2015 flood, which included new drywall and turning a bedroom into a home office. This time, water and sewage rose more than 2 feet. It wiped out the inventory of Robinson’s bath salts business, and the couple are considering moving. “We can’t live with this,” Roeder said. The river crested at 45.62 inches near Interstate 55 in Arnold on Wednesday afternoon, a bit short of the 46-foot forecast. Southbound lanes of I-55 closed about noon Wednesday and reopened early Thursday. The northbound lanes never closed. The river was forecast to remain at between 41 and 45 feet through the weekend with additional rain. A sigh of relief In Pacific, much of the water downtown had drained. City officials were inspecting homes and checking with Ameren to get electricity turned back on, according to City Administrator Steve Roth. City officials estimated more than 150 homes and businesses were damaged by the flood. In 2015, that number was more than 200, but some of those buildings were demolished because of damage. The river was at about 21 feet in Pacific late Thursday, after a crest of 33.05 feet on Tuesday. A second crest at about 25 feet is expected over the weekend due to additional rain. Throughout the region, relieved authorities warned that flood-prone areas were not completely out of the woods. A flash flood watch remained in effect through Friday morning for a large swath of the area including the Metro East, St. Louis city and the Missouri counties of St. Louis, St. Charles, Jefferson and Lincoln. Kristen Taketa, Ashley Jost and Jesse Bogan of the Post-Dispatch contributed to this report.

'The difference between genius and stupidity is genius has its limits.' - Albert Einstein Home Articles Authors Search About Us HOME / Articles / Mike Shedlock / Factory Orders, Except Aircraft, Fizzle Once Again... Factory Orders, Except Aircraft, Fizzle Once Again By: Mike Shedlock | Thu, May 4, 2017 Share Print Email Factory orders for March came in at 0.2%, below the Econoday consensus estimate of 0.4%. Taking into account a 0.2 percentage point upgrade in February, the consensus estimate is on the money. Excluding transportation, orders declined 0.3%. Highlights Factory orders, like much of the economy, fizzled in March, up only 0.2 percent and skewed higher for a third month in a row by aircraft. The split between the report's two main components shows a 0.5 percent dip for nondurable goods — the new data in today's report where weakness is tied to petroleum and coal — and a 0.9 percent rise for durable orders which is 2 tenths higher than last week's advance report for this component. The gain for durables looks impressive but when excluding transportation equipment (which is where aircraft is tracked) orders fell 0.3 percent. But core capital goods orders are a plus in the report, rising 0.5 percent (nondefense ex-aircraft) though the gain follows marginal increases of 0.1 and 0.2 percent in the prior two months. Unfilled factory orders, which had been in long contraction, are a clear plus, up 0.3 percent following February's 0.1 percent gain for the best back-to-back showing in 2-1/2 years. A negative however is a 0.1 percent decline in total shipments that came despite a constructive 0.5 percent rise in shipments of core capital goods. Inventories were unchanged in the month though the dip in shipments drove the inventory-to-shipments ratio 1 tenth higher to a less lean 1.32. Aircraft had a weak year last year and have been making up lost ground so far this year. But how long Boeing can give total orders a lift is uncertain, and the performance of the wider factory sector, despite sky high strength in many anecdotal reports, has been no better than mixed. Factory Orders Shipments and New Orders The above images from the Census Department with my highlights in yellow. There are no surprises in the report. Automotive weakened as expected. Construction fell back after a sizzling start to the year. None of this points to a strengthening second quarter. Econoday provided balanced reporting today, including a question I have been asking all quarter: How long can Boeing give total orders a lift? Regardless, those aircraft orders will ship not next quarters but many years from now. Given Boeing's backlog and ability to manage deliveries, aircraft orders will not impact GDP  much in the short run, no matter how strong or weak the reported numbers. Taking that into consideration, this report is negative for GDP.     Tweet Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

FRIEDMAN Updated 5:33 pm, Thursday, May 4, 2017 Has the first 100 days of the presidency made Donald Trump nuts? I don't ask that question as a doctor. I don't do medical diagnoses. I ask it as a newspaper reader. Trump's 100-day interviews are bizarre. Out of nowhere Trump tells us he would be "honored" to negotiate directly with the leader of North Korea, after weeks of threatening war. Out of nowhere he says he would consider a gasoline tax to pay for infrastructure. Out of nowhere he says he is considering breaking up the nation's biggest banks. He also insists that his Obamacare replacement legislation contains protections for people with pre-existing conditions that it doesn't. There's barely a dictator in the world for whom he doesn't have praise. And he repeats a known falsehood — that Barack Obama wiretapped him. Is this a political strategy unfolding or a psychiatric condition unfolding? I don't know — but it tells me that absolutely anything is possible in the next 100 days — both good and bad. Trump is clearly capable of shifting gears and striking any deal with any party on any issue. Trump was always going to be an unpredictable work-in-progress, because he did no homework before coming to office — which is why he now tells us that he's finding so many problems more difficult than he anticipated — and because he didn't know most of his Cabinet members. They're sort of a pickup basketball team, bound not by a shared vision but by a shared willingness to overlook Trump's core ignorance. In his first 100 days, allies and adversaries saved Trump and the country from some of his most extreme, ill-considered campaign promises. His foreign policy team stopped him from tearing up the Iran nuclear deal and moving the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. North Korea's missile-loving dictator saved him from declaring China a currency manipulator and starting a trade war with Beijing, because Trump discovered he needed China to restrain North Korea and avoid a war. Boeing and General Electric restrained Trump from getting rid of the Export-Import Bank, which would have left U.S. exporters at a big disadvantage. The federal courts prevented him from imposing his Muslim ban. Border-state Republicans blocked his Mexico wall and other Republicans are blocking his draconian replacement of Obamacare. U.S. farmers, whose exports to Mexico have soared since NAFTA was signed, dissuaded him from walking out of that trade deal. As for the next 100 days, who will protect us? I'm actually counting on California. How so? Trump wants to scrap Obama-era standards requiring passenger cars to average about 51 mpg by 2025; today it's just under 37 mpg. As the Los Angeles Times noted, under the Clean Air Act, California "can impose emissions standards stronger than those set by the federal government, and a dozen other states have embraced the California rules." More than one-third of the vehicles sold in the United States are subject to the rules California sets. Trump can deregulate U.S. automakers to make more gas guzzlers all he wants, but they can't if they want to sell cars in California. Ditto California companies: Apple is now powering 96 percent of its operations around the world with renewable energy — 100 percent in 24 countries — including the U.S. and China. Trump's pro-coal — make-America-cough-again — campaign will never get Apple back on coal. As Kevin de Leon, leader of the California state Senate, told me: California has far more clean energy jobs than there are coal jobs in all of America, and California's now nation-leading growth rate in jobs gives the lie to everything Trump says: You can have gradually rising clean energy standards, innovation, job creation and GDP growth — at the same time. California is also leading the resistance to Trump's draconian immigration policies, with a web of initiatives embracing tighter border controls while also creating health care, education and work opportunities for unauthorized immigrants who have been living here responsibly. "We have made it very clear — we will protect our economic prosperity and our values from Trump," said de Leon, whose Legislature recently hired former Attorney General Eric Holder to defend it against Trump suits. Holder is California's (and my) secretary of defense. Thomas L. Friedman writes for The New York Times. This is a TU+ story. Click for more information.

China wants to make it eight. The country's first-ever commercial jet is scheduled to make its  maiden flight  Friday. This doesn't mean the state-owned C919 will be taking passengers right away. First, it must pass a battery of safety tests. But a successful flight on Friday would be an important step in selling the planes to airlines. Right now, most of those waiting to buy C919s are located in China, but that's also where the most money is expected to be. Thanks in part to its growing middle class, China boasts the  fastest-growing  aviation market.  SEE MORE: China's New Unveiling Might Have The World Taking Notice It's expected to overtake the U.S. as the  largest commercial market  in less than a decade. Analysts don't believe the C919 will threaten Airbus' or Boeing's dominance. But because the Chinese market is so huge, the makers of the C919 expect to sell thousands of planes by 2037. And that could still be worth  hundreds of billions  of dollars.

Ron T. Ennis Star-Telegram archives Congress May 04, 2017 5:00 PM Congress is not happy with the Pentagon’s F-35 office By Alex Daugherty adaugherty@mcclatchydc.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story WASHINGTON Lawmakers on Capitol Hill are not pleased with the Pentagon office that is assigned to work with Lockheed Martin on negotiating a price for the F-35 fighter jet, the nation’s most expensive defense program. Inside a 372-page document explaining the impacts of the 2017 budget on defense spending is a two-page mention of the F-35 fighter jet, which is assembled in Fort Worth, Texas, by Lockheed. The document blasts the Pentagon office tasked with running the F-35 program as non-communicative with Congress. “Throughout the fiscal year 2017 budget review process, the Joint Strike Fighter Joint Program Office provided insufficient justification and incomplete information in an untimely manner,” the document reads. “It is imperative that requested information is received promptly for proper congressional oversight of this major defense acquisition program.” The Pentagon did not return a request for comment. Lockheed Martin declined to comment. “They need to be transparent, don’t they?” said Rep. Roger Williams, an Austin, Texas, Republican. “We need to have better communications, we need to demand that they watch expenses. This is taxpayer money they are spending. There should be no surprises in Congress based on what the Pentagon has done.” The document is part of a temporary spending bill that lasts through Sept. 30 and received the blessing of both parties after weeks of negotiations. It includes an $15 billion increase in defense spending, although not as much as President Donald Trump wanted. The spending bill is expected to be signed by Trump before midnight on Friday, avoiding a government shutdown. Additionally, Congress says in the report that the Pentagon failed to contract the number of F-35 that it asked for in the 2015 and 2016 budget bills, which resulted in “impeding production efficiencies.” “Four F-35s included in the Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2015 and 13 F-35s included in the Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2016 were not part of their respective low rate initial production (LRIP) contracts due to the ... contracting strategy,” the document reads. Richard Aboulafia, a military aircraft analyst with Teal Group, a Northern Virginia based aeronautics analysis firm, said the difference between the number of F-35’s appropriated by Congress and ultimately built by Lockheed could be due to production bottlenecks on the Fort Worth assembly line or among Lockheed’s myriad subcontractors. “This is clearly not a problem that can be solved by throwing cash at it,” Aboulafia said. “It might be that planes need to be modified and reworked, and trying to get the learning curve with three different planes is difficult. Production is happening at a much lower rate than we hoped for.” Part of the difference between Congress’ desires for the F-35 and what is ultimately agreed to between the Pentagon and Lockheed is the complexities of the F-35C, the variant of the jet designed to take off and land on aircraft carriers. The F-35C has experienced issues with excessive shaking during take off and inadequate wing strength in recent months, and those problems need to be corrected before full production ramps up. “It’s very telling that the Joint Program Office is not providing information Congress is asking for at this time in particular, when the program office is really working to secure a significant increase in production,” said Dan Grazier, a fellow at The Project for Government Oversight, a government watchdog group that opposes the F-35. “The program is supposed to shift into test and operation period, so this is a very concerning ... development.” Defense Secretary Gen. James Mattis ordered a review of the F-35C in January after Trump complained that the F-35 program was too expensive. The review compares the F-35C with the F-18 Super Hornet, a plane built by Lockheed competitor Boeing. The review is still ongoing. EDITORS: STORY CAN END HERE While Congress provides oversight for the F-35 program and allocates money to the Pentagon, it does not have the ability to negotiate with Lockheed on a price for the jets, which recently fell below $100 million per jet for the conventional take off and landing model. But critics of the program, including Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., are worried that long-term costs of the F-35 program will continue to increase even as the price per plane goes down. The Government Accountability Office released a report in April saying that F-35 testing delays could cost taxpayers and additional $1 billion “I have been recently informed the F-35’s system development and demonstration phase has been delayed another seven months, another costly stumble that will cost the American taxpayer at least $500 million,” McCain said in a statement. “This is yet another troubling sign for a program that has already nearly doubled in cost, taken nearly two decades to field, and has long been the poster child for acquisition malpractice.” The F-35 is scheduled to begin full rate production in April 2019 and the testing delays put that date in jeopardy. But Aboulafia said there isn’t much Congress can do other than complain, unless it wants to pull the plug altogether, which is highly unlikely. “There are two flavors of programs in the Pentagon, one is a healthy program and the other is a death spiral,” Aboulafia said. “Unless they want to inflict a death spiral they can give the money and complain while they do it.” Vera Bergengruen contributed to this article.

Valley Park Mayor Michael A. Pennise sent a letter to residents and business owners Thursday afternoon, saying a mandatory evacuation that went into effect Tuesday will be lifted at 8 a.m. Friday. But he advised the city will continue to monitor a secondary crest that’s expected on the Meramec after this week’s rain. “Please exercise caution in the levee protected areas as city maintenance crews are still working to pump some storm water levee detention basins,” Pennise said. “For the business owners affected south of the Meramec River, the city asks you to respect them by not driving in the immediate area while they clean up and recover after this flooding event.” Crews are clearing roads of debris to get them reopened, the mayor said. The river crested in Valley Park at 43.31 feet early Wednesday. It had dropped below 36 feet by Thursday night. After a second crest on Sunday at about 32 feet, the river was forecast to drop to 12 feet there by next Thursday, illustrating how quickly the Meramec can swell and shrink. ‘Better than last time’ In downtown Eureka, several businesses had started cleaning up the water damage. But the sandbags will remain, said Don Tomnitz, assistant chief with the Eureka Fire Protection District. Scott Barthelmass of the Eureka Fire Department said the concern isn’t more flooding, but rather safety with respect to the continuing rain. Removing the sandbags can wait. The river was at 34.5 feet late Thursday after cresting at 46.11 feet Tuesday night. The river was expected to continue dropping. Still, a second, smaller crest is expected over the weekend. That crest was forecast at about 34 feet. The levels of damage varied greatly. Chick-n-Elly’s fried chicken restaurant did not take in any water. The owners hope to open on Saturday. The office of Shelter Insurance agent Steve Parker got 41 inches of water. When the flood happened in December 2015, he was away on vacation and came back to find everything damaged. This time, employees were able to move the furniture and other items out of harm’s way, leaving the damage primarily to the carpet, which was being torn out Thursday morning. At St. Francis’ Episcopal Church, workers were cutting away drywall and rolling out carpet soaked by water that rose to 4 feet. All the items at ground level had been moved to safety prior to the flood. Across the region, schools and roads remained closed as floodwater continued making commutes near the river a challenge. However, both lanes of Interstate 55 running through Jefferson County were open. In Arnold, residents were praising city leaders and utility companies for being better prepared than when floods pummeled the area 16 months ago. Michael Doutre, of the 2300 block of Boeing Drive, said that in December 2015 water filled his basement and made its way into the main level of the house. This go-around, three pumps running in his basement kept the water out of the rest of the house. “This is a whole lot better than last time,” Doutre said as he and neighbors cleaned up. Because authorities did a better job of predicting the flood and warning residents it was coming, Doutre said he was able to move furniture and other items into a neighbor’s house where high water was not expected. The added time allowed neighbors to build sandbag walls and get pumps in place. But flood damage twice within two years was too much for some residents. “Every 500 year flood? Shouldn’t it be like every 15 month flood?” said Keith Roeder, who lives on Electra Drive with his wife, Stacy Robinson. Three weeks ago, they had finally finished basement repairs from the December 2015 flood, which included new drywall and turning a bedroom into a home office. This time, water and sewage rose more than 2 feet. It wiped out the inventory of Robinson’s bath salts business, and the couple are considering moving. “We can’t live with this,” Roeder said. The river crested at 45.62 inches near Interstate 55 in Arnold on Wednesday afternoon, a bit short of the 46-foot forecast. Southbound lanes of I-55 closed about noon Wednesday and reopened early Thursday. The northbound lanes never closed. The river was forecast to remain at between 41 and 45 feet through the weekend with additional rain. A sigh of relief In Pacific, much of the water downtown had drained. City officials were inspecting homes and checking with Ameren to get electricity turned back on, according to City Administrator Steve Roth. City officials estimated more than 150 homes and businesses were damaged by the flood. In 2015, that number was more than 200, but some of those buildings were demolished because of damage. The river was at about 21 feet in Pacific late Thursday, after a crest of 33.05 feet on Tuesday. A second crest at about 25 feet is expected over the weekend due to additional rain. Throughout the region, relieved authorities warned that flood-prone areas were not completely out of the woods. A flash flood watch remained in effect through Friday morning for a large swath of the area including the Metro East, St. Louis city and the Missouri counties of St. Louis, St. Charles, Jefferson and Lincoln.

Stringer, Esq. Managing Director & Practice Leader, Site Selection and Business Incentives Group, BDO USA Tim Feemster Managing Principal, Foremost Quality Logistics Workforce Development | Skilled Labor / STEM Workforce Supply and Demand in the Automotive Industry The automotive industry today is all about technology. Think the gadgets you find inside your car, the apps you use to find a last-minute ride, and the production lines that churn out automobiles. Joshua Wright, Director of Marketing and PR, Emsi Q1 2017 This article is adapted from Emsi’s presentation at Area Development’s Consultants Forum Automotive Workshop. The blurring of automotive and technology stands out in the real-time job postings data and the online worker profiles that Emsi parses every day. Auto makers are looking for design engineers and software developers with skills like design failure mode and effects analysis, Simulink, and computer-aided 3D interactive applications (CATIA). There are workers with these skills based on our professional profile database that normalizes publicly available data from CareerBuilder, Facebook, Twitter, Github, Google, and Quora, and other professional networking sites. Related Research The “Truth” on the Ground: Understanding Your Potential Workforce Labor Force Challenges / Solutions in the Auto Industry Regional Talent Attraction Study Results: It’s Not All About Core Cities Automated Vehicles Revolutionizing the Automotive Industry But are there enough of them in the right places considering the changing geography of the auto industry? We looked at the most common skills and job titles asked for in job postings from 11 major auto makers from January 2016 to January 2017. (Job ads don’t give the full picture of potential hiring, especially in production-intensive industries, but they still indicate the skills and job titles that auto makers are requesting in their online postings.) We then matched the job postings data with our profile database as a proxy for gauging current workforce supply and demand. Auto Makers’ Job Posting Patterns In the last year, Chrysler has posted the most raw job ads of any automotive manufacturer. But when we de-duplicate these postings, GM and Tesla stand above Chrysler and every other auto maker. And after the top three, there’s a big drop-off in unique job postings from Chrysler to Ford and Honda … and an even bigger drop-off from Honda to Volkswagen and Toyota. Expand Close Auto Makers’ Job Posting Patterns: Jan 2016 - Jan 2017 The Detroit area (Auburn Hills, Dearborn, Warren) make up the largest percentage (over 30% of where these ads are posted. But Bay Area cities like Fremont and Palo Alto, as well as Oxnard in southern California and Austin and Dallas, also show up prominently in postings of auto makers. This indicates, as does standard labor market data, that the concentration of auto jobs is flattening—first from the Rust Belt to the South, and now to the West Coast and Texas. The 11 auto makers shown in the chart above posted more than 100,000 de-duplicated postings from January 2016 to January 2017. And of those unique job ads, nearly 10% were for three job titles: design engineers, software engineers, and systems engineers. Other common job titles in auto makers’ postings: project managers, quality assurance engineers, research specialists, and control engineers. (As hinted at above, job postings tend to be biased toward high-skill positions.) Expand Close Top Job Titles in Auto Makers’ Postings: Jan 2016 - Jan 2017 The most unique or relevant hard skill these auto makers asked for in postings was powertrain, followed by design failure mode and effects analysis, and engineering. After CATIA and manufacturing, stamping—or metalworking, a more traditional auto manufacturing skill—appears on the list. The Supply Side How do these job posting trends match the supply of the workforce? We found 134,500 workers who mentioned five of these specific skills (powertrain, design failure mode and effects analysis, CATIA, stamping, and Simulink) and have updated their online profiles since 2015. These workers can be found at Ford, GM, Boeing, Chrysler, Cummins, and thousands of other companies. And most of them have the same job titles that the auto makers are putting in their job ads—design engineer, mechanical engineer, and systems engineer are three most common based on the percentile distribution of profiles. And what about the geographic distribution of these profiles? The epicenter is Detroit, with 14% of the 134,500 profiles. Los Angeles, Chicago and tech hotspots Seattle and San Francisco also have around 2% each of these workers. Expand Close Most Relevant Hard Skills in Auto Makers’ Job Postings: Jan 2016 - Jan 2017 Conclusion So, back to the question we posed at the start: Are there enough engineers, software developers, and other highly skilled workers to meet auto makers’ needs? It’d be helpful to extend this analysis to investigate more skills and more job titles, but at quick glance, it’s no surprise that auto companies have a hard time locating talent. For example, we show 144,000 online profiles for design engineers nationwide, but fewer than 13,000 of these profiles include the five core skills we mentioned that auto makers have solicited in their job ads. In response to these types of talent needs, economic developers and their community workforce partners should have a firm grasp on their key industry clusters and supply chains. We find that there’s often high skills transferability between suppliers and manufacturers. And these suppliers, many of them small- to mid-sized businesses, can make great partners for local training providers that are addressing the auto industry’s increasingly tech-focused workforce challenges.

Photo by Robert Cohen, rcohen@post-dispatch.com VALLEY PARK • The high water that enveloped communities along the Meramec River had begun to recede Thursday, but authorities remained cautious about moving back into hard-hit areas. Valley Park Mayor Michael A. Pennise sent a letter to residents and business owners Thursday afternoon, saying a mandatory evacuation that went into effect Tuesday will be lifted at 8 a.m. Friday. But he advised the city will continue to monitor a secondary crest that’s expected on the Meramec after this week’s rain. “Please exercise caution in the levee protected areas as city maintenance crews are still working to pump some storm water levee detention basins,” Pennise said. “For the business owners affected south of the Meramec River, the city asks you to respect them by not driving in the immediate area while they clean up and recover after this flooding event.” Crews are clearing roads of debris to get them reopened, the mayor said. The river crested in Valley Park at 43.31 feet early Wednesday. It had dropped below 36 feet by Thursday night. After a second crest on Sunday at about 32 feet, the river was forecast to drop to 12 feet there by next Thursday, illustrating how quickly the Meramec can swell and shrink. ‘Better than last time’ In downtown Eureka, several businesses had started cleaning up the water damage. But the sandbags will remain, said Don Tomnitz, assistant chief with the Eureka Fire Protection District. Scott Barthelmass of the Eureka Fire Department said the concern isn’t more flooding, but rather safety with respect to the continuing rain. Removing the sandbags can wait. The river was at 34.5 feet late Thursday after cresting at 46.11 feet Tuesday night. The river was expected to continue dropping. Still, a second, smaller crest is expected over the weekend. That crest was forecast at about 34 feet. The levels of damage varied greatly. Chick-n-Elly’s fried chicken restaurant did not take in any water. The owners hope to open on Saturday. The office of Shelter Insurance agent Steve Parker got 41 inches of water. When the flood happened in December 2015, he was away on vacation and came back to find everything damaged. This time, employees were able to move the furniture and other items out of harm’s way, leaving the damage primarily to the carpet, which was being torn out Thursday morning. At St. Francis’ Episcopal Church, workers were cutting away drywall and rolling out carpet soaked by water that rose to 4 feet. All the items at ground level had been moved to safety prior to the flood. Across the region, schools and roads remained closed as floodwater continued making commutes near the river a challenge. However, both lanes of Interstate 55 running through Jefferson County were open. In Arnold, residents were praising city leaders and utility companies for being better prepared than when floods pummeled the area 16 months ago. Michael Doutre, of the 2300 block of Boeing Drive, said that in December 2015 water filled his basement and made its way into the main level of the house. This go-around, three pumps running in his basement kept the water out of the rest of the house. “This is a whole lot better than last time,” Doutre said as he and neighbors cleaned up. Because authorities did a better job of predicting the flood and warning residents it was coming, Doutre said he was able to move furniture and other items into a neighbor’s house where high water was not expected. The added time allowed neighbors to build sandbag walls and get pumps in place. But flood damage twice within two years was too much for some residents. “Every 500 year flood? Shouldn’t it be like every 15 month flood?” said Keith Roeder, who lives on Electra Drive with his wife, Stacy Robinson. Three weeks ago, they had finally finished basement repairs from the December 2015 flood, which included new drywall and turning a bedroom into a home office. This time, water and sewage rose more than 2 feet. It wiped out the inventory of Robinson’s bath salts business, and the couple are considering moving. “We can’t live with this,” Roeder said. The river crested at 45.62 inches near Interstate 55 in Arnold on Wednesday afternoon, a bit short of the 46-foot forecast. Southbound lanes of I-55 closed about noon Wednesday and reopened early Thursday. The northbound lanes never closed. The river was forecast to remain at between 41 and 45 feet through the weekend with additional rain. A sigh of relief In Pacific, much of the water downtown had drained. City officials were inspecting homes and checking with Ameren to get electricity turned back on, according to City Administrator Steve Roth. City officials estimated more than 150 homes and businesses were damaged by the flood. In 2015, that number was more than 200, but some of those buildings were demolished because of damage. The river was at about 21 feet in Pacific late Thursday, after a crest of 33.05 feet on Tuesday. A second crest at about 25 feet is expected over the weekend due to additional rain. Throughout the region, relieved authorities warned that flood-prone areas were not completely out of the woods. A flash flood watch remained in effect through Friday morning for a large swath of the area including the Metro East, St. Louis city and the Missouri counties of St. Louis, St. Charles, Jefferson and Lincoln. Kristen Taketa, Ashley Jost and Jesse Bogan of the Post-Dispatch contributed to this report.

Southwest Airlines Co. 04 May, 2017, 12:01 ET Share this article DALLAS, May 4, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Southwest Airlines Co. (NYSE: LUV) announced today that it'll be adding its award-winning Cargo services to its new operation at Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport (CVG) starting June 5, 2017. The carrier begins passenger service one day before with flights between Chicago Midway (MDW) and Baltimore/Washington International Airport (BWI), Southwest's two busiest airports in terms of daily departures. "Companies around the country rely on Southwest's relentlessly reliable Cargo Team to get the job done," said Matt Buckley, Vice President of Southwest's Cargo and Charters. "Our Hospitality, Customer Service, and attention to detail are what set us apart from our competitors. We're looking forward to assisting businesses throughout the Cincinnati region with their shipping needs while also enabling shippers from across the country to reach this key business market." Southwest Airlines' Bold Look; Same #SouthwestHeart (PRNewsFoto/Southwest Airlines) "We're very pleased that Southwest will be offering cargo services at CVG," said Candace McGraw, chief executive officer, CVG. "We look forward to Southwest starting service and growing its partnership with CVG and the businesses in our region." The carrier will offer its Cargo services on its normally scheduled domestic flights through Wright Brothers Aero, Inc. Their offices will be located at 1360 Donaldson Road Center I, Suite D, Erlanger, Ky., 41018, and open Monday through Friday from 5:00am to 1:00am.

Weather Your 4-day local weather forecast Friday May 5, 2017 Life & Style Travel Larger / SmallerNight Mode Best new travel destinations, hotels and travel experiences of 2016 named 3 Jan 2017, 9:50 a.m. From Italy’s new Tuscany to Africa’s true adventure island, these are our best travel discoveries for 2016. Best new travel destinations, hotels and travel experiences of 2016 named Escape the crowd: Tours run from Hamilton Island to the stunning and secluded Chalkies Beach. Photo: Kara Rosenlund Best region: The increasingly popular Basilicata, Italy. Photo: iStock Tweet Facebook of ╳ exit Even travel writers get excited. Even those of us lucky enough to see the world for a living, to travel, to experience, to taste and to feel and call it a job – we still get excited about new discoveries. The world, you see, is always changing. It always retains the power to surprise. There's a constant supply of new places to visit, new sights to see, new experiences to have. And even those places we as travellers know so well still beg to be seen with fresh eyes every visit, still have the intrigue to reveal something previously unknown. For the past 12 months, the Traveller team has been scouring the globe in search of the new, the updated, the fascinating and the exciting. We've searched not just for destinations, but for the trends and the technological advancements that are changing the way we see the world today. This year we've flown hundreds of thousands of kilometres, and touched down on every continent. We've slept in hotels and hostels, on mountaintops and by the sea. We've tasted foods both traditional and new. We've hiked, we've biked, we've driven and we've sailed. We've been inspired, we've been surprised, and we've been delighted. From the luxury to the budget-friendly, from the unknown to the famous, from destinations far ashore to those on this big island we call home, these are the discoveries that have excited us most here at Traveller in 2016. - Ben Groundwater BEST FINDS 2016 PLACES BEST REGION Basilicata, Italy We all know about the Tuscan sun and the Venetian dream, but the next big thing in Italy could be far to the south, in the once-impoverished Basilicata region. One of only two Italian regions with coasts on two seas, Basilicata is headlined by the extraordinary troglodyte city (and now Hollywood favourite) of Matera, but it's also home to the country's largest national park, Pollino, which has alpine peaks up to 2267 metres in height and autumn slopes of brilliant shades. See discoverbasilicata.com See also: Italy's best hidden beaches BEST TOWN Haapsalu, Estonia It's said that Pyotr Tchaikovsky was so taken with Haapsalu that he was inspired to compose Swan Lake, and the classical charm of the Estonian fishing town hasn't wilted in the subsequent 150 years. The town centre is almost enclosed by a lagoon-like piece of the Baltic Sea (yes, usually covered in swans) and lorded over by an incongruously large castle. Ranged across the foot of the castle is a line of Scandinavian-style buildings containing restaurants with outdoor decks that literally spill into the main street. See visitestonia.com/en See: One of the best regions to cycle in Europe BEST DESERT Sossusvlei, Namibia Spectacular Sossusvlei, in the southern Namib, is deep desert, with some of the world's tallest dunes, painted vivid pink and orange. Meaning dead-end marsh, this is an extraordinary world of stony outcrops, severe clay pans and gobsmacking heat. Only those few creatures that have adapted can survive. The sculptural "star dunes", with their high iron content, change shape with the wind – a photographer's dream. Hard to get there, but worth it. See sossusvlei.org See also: Taking 'the world's most luxurious train' through Namibia BEST ISLAND Madagascar Photo: iStock Deforestation has scarred much of the world's fourth biggest island, but it remains one of the planet's most compelling destinations. Madagascar's wildlife, including many species of lemur, and the cat-like foussa, is the big draw, with 92 per cent of its mammals found nowhere else. Landscapes, like the razor-sharp limestone forest in World Heritage-listed Tsingy National Park, the spirited, un-tourist weary Malagasy people, and the deeply rutted roads, make travelling here a real adventure. See worldexpeditions.com See: The unforgettable badlands of Madagascar BEST LESSER-KNOWN AUSTRALIAN BEACHES Chalkies Beach and Bryan's Beach, Queensland Photo: Kara Rosenlund When visiting Queensland's Whitsunday Islands or Tasmania's pristine Freycinet National Park, locals happily watch visitors flock in their thousands to the iconic Whitehaven Beach and Wineglass Bay – largely considered Australia's best beaches. But the lesser known and closely guarded Chalkies Beach (opposite Whitehaven Beach) and the glorious Bryan's Beach are not only just as magnificent (arguably more so), they're crowd-free too. Tours run to Chalkies Beach from Hamilton Island. Bryan's Beach (not far from Saffire, Freycinet) is harder to reach but oh so worth it. See hamiltonisland.com.au See also: Australia's best beach named - and no one has ever heard of it BEST GARDEN Brief Garden, Sri Lanka Just inland from Sri Lanka's resort town of Bentota, Brief Garden covers just two hectares yet it feels like a small world. Created by Bevis Bawa, brother of the island's famous architect Geoffrey Bawa, the garden's snaking paths, swooning tropical foliage and aromatic trees that drip voluptuously, make a wild kingdom, but there's style in the dark tunnel of cannonball trees that leads to classical amphitheatre and the stone staircase that rises through sculpted bamboo. See also: Sri Lanka, the world's newest five-star destination STAYS BEST ACCOMMODATION Solomon Islands Tavanipupu Resort is a stunning getaway-from-it-all private island in Guadalcanal Province. After the short scenic flight from Honiara lands on a grass airstrip, you slide into Tavanipupu's pure romantic serenity, as Wills and Kate did in 2012. The ten spacious, free-standing bungalows are beautifully presented and with no phone, Wi-Fi or TV you are free to snorkel, fish, relax, take a sunset cruise or visit the traditional village across the channel. Room service? Sure, just bang your drum. tavanipupu.com Read: Traveller's Tavanipupu full review BEST NEW LUXURY LODGE explora Valle Sagrado, Peru Luxury doesn't have to be about exquisite food and spa baths (although you'll find both here); luxury, too, can refer to experiences – and that's what Chilean company explora is all about. Their newest opening is explora Valle Sagrado, a sustainably designed 50-room lodge located in Peru's Sacred Valley. Although it's a delightful base, a stay here focuses on the outside rather than the inside, with 20 different styles of guided excursions spanning hiking, biking and road adventures. See explora.com BEST FOODIE STAY Brae, Birregurra, Victoria On official lists of the world's and Australia's best restaurants, when Victoria's Brae restaurant launched its on-site accommodation, it needed to be good. What chef Dan Hunter and his wife and business partner Julianne Bagnato achieved with their six luxury suites, designed by Six Degrees Architects and Studio Round, is sublime. A simpatico extension of the fine dining Brae restaurant experience, these environmentally efficient villas are as much a statement of Hunter's personality and attention to detail as is his menu. Recycled materials, local artworks and a great collection of vinyl records comprise a sumptuous crash pad to sleep off Hunter's amazing degustations, with waking up to the lush Otways countryside a sweet finale. See braerestaurant.com Read: Traveller's full review of Brae's suites BEST HOTEL La Residence, Franschhoek, South Africa There are good hotels, there are great hotels, and then there are places like La Residence in South Africa. This boutique property in the Cape wine country, set amid the vines just an hour from Cape Town, does everything right. The rooms are huge and opulently furnished. The staff are professional and greet you by name. And the small touches that make you feel like a star – the valet parking, the chauffer service into town, the open mini-bar, the a la carte breakfast, the sunset drinks – just keep on coming. See laresidence.co.za. Read: Traveller's full La Residence review BEST COUNTRY HOUSE Lime Wood Hotel, Lyndhurst, UK Surrounded by horse-cropped fields in a fold of the New Forest less than two hours from London, this retreat pulls out all the country stops – ivy-clad walls, meandering garden paths, crackling fires and snifters of brandy – and yet doesn't overindulge in stereotypes. The spa is resolutely contemporary, Laura Ashley is banished; the bar features pink leather chairs and the restaurant stylish Italian nosh. See limewoodhotel.co.uk BEST AFRICAN LODGE Phinda Mountain Lodge, South Africa Phinda is a super-stylish &Beyond property, set on 14,000 hectares in the dramatic KwaZulu-Natal region. The decor is designer-bush – its spacious, light-filled suites are decorated with contemporary African artefacts, you have an outdoor shower and plunge pool on your deck and the airy dining room has wide-ranging views over the plains and mountains. The reserve is renowned for its cheetah sightings and it more than lives up to its reputation. See andbeyond.com FOOD AND WINE BEST FOOD Korea The Korean food scene is on the brink of fame. Asia's quite achiever finally began to get the recognition it deserves in 2016, with Michelin releasing its first "red guide" to Seoul's restaurants, and travellers flocking to see what the fuss is about. The country's fine-dining scene is taking off. However, most Koreans will tell you their food is best at its simplest: meat barbecued at the table; fried chicken served with beer; fresh-caught fish steamed to perfection. It's cheap, too. See visitkorea.or.kr See: Korean street food - how to eat like a local in Seoul BEST FOOD TOUR BY FOOT You could be forgiven for thinking that Dubai wouldn't be much use for a walking food tour, but during the temperate winter months, Frying Pan Adventures offer just that. With various programmes taking in different ethnic foods around the historic creek and its surrounding neighbourhoods, the idea isn't so much to try Arabic food as to take part in the immigrant experience. Run by sisters Arva and Farida Ahmed, this is a chance to see and taste a side of Dubai you probably didn't know existed. See fryingpanadventures.com BEST CELLAR DOOR EXPERIENCE Heifer Station's new cellar door in a converted wool shed in Orange not only serves up great wine from its cool climate vineyard, but has opened a petting farm as well so kids can play while mum and dad imbibe. The bucolic winery will also set you up with a picnic among the vines and come back and collect you when you're done. Wine tasting with children has never been more appealing. See heiferstation.com CRUISE BEST ON-BOARD CRUISE EXPERIENCE The Haven on NCL's Norwegian Epic Book into the "ship within a ship" on Norwegian Epic and you can enjoy all the big-ship facilities – rock-climbing walls, waterparks, Broadway shows – while having exclusive access to The Haven's pool, sundeck, restaurant, lounge, bar and spa. The service there is top-notch and when the non-stop action gets a bit much, it's the perfect retreat. Ideal for multi-generational cruisers, The Haven is also on Norwegian Escape, Getaway, Breakaway, Gem, Jade, Jewel and Pearl. See ncl.com/au/en BEST CRUISE SHORE EXCURSION Private wine tour, Tuscany, Italy Photo: iStock For a taste of Tuscany away from the madding midsummer crowds, consider a private vineyard tour with sommelier Massimo Cenci. Massimo takes small groups on individually tailored itineraries that focus on the wines of five lesser-known Tuscan coastal regions. We visited two boutique vineyards – I Giusti e Zanza and Michele Satta – and enjoyed a wonderful long lunch at Osteria La Gattaiola in the tiny town of Fauglia between sampling sessions. A truly grand day out. Email massimocenci1969@gmail.com See also: The ultimate food lovers' guide to Italy's best restaurants BEST CRUISE SHIP Star Clipper If cruise ships ever begin to seem the same-same, then it's time to board one of this cruise company's fabulous ships such as Star Flyer for something akin to a 19th-century sailing experience – though without the weevils and hammocks. Expect polished mahogany and teakwood, gleaming brass work and, above all, 16 billowing white sails across four towering masts that bring thrilling romance back to the sailing experience. See starclippers.com/au BEST ON-SHORE FEAST Pulau Jaco, East Timor Overseas lines that cruise the Kimberley have to make "technical stops" outside Australian waters. Silver Discoverer spends a day in the uninhabited island of Pulau Jaco in East Timor, within the Nino Konis Santana National Park. The crew sets up a fabulous barbecue and bar on the beach and just a couple of metres offshore colourful coral reefs swarm with tropical fish. So refreshing to plunge into the sea without worrying about being devoured by crocodiles. See silversea.com BEST FEEL-GOOD SHORE EXCURSION Cheung Kok, Cambodia There's not a plastic bag to be seen in this picturesque Khmer eco-village. The community is supported by Amica, an international voluntary association that helped the villagers set up traditional handicraft businesses and retain a way of life that is hundreds of years old. Gorgeous children chase you along sandy streets and who can resist buying silk and cotton kramas (multi-purpose scarfs) when you've just seen them being hand-woven? See scenic.com.au BEST ON-BOARD COOKING SCHOOL Regent Seven Seas Explorer, Culinary Arts Kitchen The uber-luxury line's first culinary school on its newest ship is, as you'd expect, top notch. It has 18 cooking stations, giant TV screens for close-up views of the action and fabulous sea views. Chef Noelle takes our group through the Mediterranean menu and with her expert help – and humorous comments – we produce three delicious dishes. The enjoyment factor is considerably heightened when you don't have to shop, prep, or wash up. See rssc.com TRANSPORT BEST ARRIVAL Monaco by helicopter To make a real entrance in Monaco, do it by air. One problem — this postage stamp principality doesn't have an airstrip. Instead, at Nice Airport you step into a sleek, black Monacair helicopter which zips out to sea before banking along the Mediterranean coast. Seven minutes later an enclave of apartments and glittering yacht harbours appears, and at the last moment a waterfront heli-pad. Price: €145 including a limo to whisk you to your hotel. Worth it. See monacoair.mc See: 20 reasons to visit Monaco BEST CAR FOR TOURING The Fiat 500 In 1957, Italy was introduced to the Nuova 500, a car so excellent it was re-introduced 50 years later as the Fiat 500. It remains compact and excellent as a town car, particularly the "C" models with a retractable roof. Given that many roads in Europe were never designed for automobile traffic – try driving through an ancient Etruscan village for hair-raising proof – this is a dependable solution, as nimble in tight spots as a mouse. Looks good, too. See fiat.com.au BEST AIRCRAFT The A350 Shiny and new and offered on numerous new services to and from Australia in 2016, the A350 is revolutionising the route map with its long range capabilities. Airbus's newest is also relatively quiet, roomy and atmospherically flyer-friendly, offering some perceived advantages – according to many pundits – over its direct competitor, the B-787. Those include more individual space in economy and window shades. The 787 has electronically dimming windows and a little less room in economy on most configurations, though it's still a fabulous aircraft. See airbus.com See: Airbus A350 vs Boeing Dreamliner - which plane is best on a long haul? BEST NON FOSSIL-FUELLED TRANSPORT Camel power, South Australia. The remote reaches of the northern Flinders Ranges are tough, dry and unyielding on foot ... unless you have some powerful companions carrying hundreds of litres of water. Hiking with pack camels opens up this arid country in ways possible through no other form of transport. Camp can be made anywhere and far from roads, and exploration is limited only by the agility of the animals, which are surprisingly companionable hiking partners. See worldexpeditions.com/au BEST DEPARTURE Launceston Airport Holding on to the holiday vibe a bit longer is easier at Launceston Airport after a $3.5 million transformation of the terminal that includes the best of local food and wine at this gateway to the north of the state. Watch planes come and go with an Oomph gourmet coffee in hand or sample the local Josef Chromy pinot on tap and an Ashgrove cheese board before boarding. See launcestonairport.com.au BEST CYCLING DAY TOUR Viator electric bike Gaudi tour, Barcelona, Spain Riding an e-bike allows you to cover more distance than a regular bike and our enthusiastic guide, Alessandra, led four of us on a swooping tour around the striking buildings designed by Barcelona's famous architect Antoni Gaudi. She was incredibly well-informed about the city and her passion for Gaudi's works was inspiring. Highlights included viewing La Sagrada Familia from a quiet park, stopping at El Born Cultural Centre and visiting places we may never have discovered independently. See viator.com BEST SCENIC FLIGHT Bungle Bungle Adventurer, Western Australia A flight of about two hours in a 14-seater plane from remote Kununurra gives a bird's eye view of land and water masses that are almost incomprehensibly vast. As we flew over Lake Argyle, massive cattle stations and the beehive-like Bungle Bungles, our pilot told us that the Argyle Diamond mine, famed for its rare pink diamonds, also produced an intriguing insider crime operation back in the 1980s. You'll have to go to hear the story.

You can hardly blame the wearer – it's stretchy, comfy and does double time as workout wear – should you ever work out on holiday. But will it get you an upgrade? Melbourne brand Sassind has simplified a woman's conundrum of balancing in-the-air comfort with on-the-ground style, via a range of co-ordinated basics in natural fibres that are not only comfy for long haul, but perfectly stylish. They are ethically produced, as well. See sassind.com BEST APP maps.me It's not often we discover an app that truly changes the way we travel. By utilising GPS technology to provide real-time offline map navigation, maps.me has done away with the need for travellers to connect to Wi-Fi or to clock up huge data roaming charges while figuring out the way from A to B in Marseille, Manhattan and many other places. After the initial map download, which does require Wi-Fi or data, the free, worldwide app provides accurate navigation even when the device is in airplane mode. See maps.me BEST SHOE Athleisure Hybrids of anything can turn out to be Frankenstein's monsters, such as the pizza-burger, or Madonna's accent. But some, like say, the cronut, turn out to be sheer genius. And the athleisure shoe falls into the latter category. A nifty combination of athletic and smart footwear, this is a shoe that can have you strolling kilometres of shops in fashion-conscious Milan without a disdainful glance in the direction of your feet, or going from a Montmartre walking tour to a trendy Parisian bar with stylish confidence. Many active shoe companies now make them; Merrell is a champ at it. See merrellaustralia.com.au BEST CAMERA GEAR EVO GP 3 Axis Handheld Gimbal Action cameras like the GoPro give the wow factor to adventure holidays but the footage can be shaky and rough. Gimbals are hand-held motorised stabilisers that iron out the shakes in that hard-to-watch video for a pro grade result. Your panning shots, shots from fast moving boats or cars are transformed into silky smooth cinema productions. Several Go-Pro gimbals are available, none of them cheap, and the EVO is one of the best. See evogimbals.com CULTURE BEST THEATRE Shakespeare Theatre in Gdansk, Poland You wouldn't expect to find a link to The Bard in Poland's historic Baltic port, but in the 17th-century, Gdansk hosted English actors in a theatre based on an Elizabethan London playhouse. Constructed on the same site, the Shakespeare Theatre is an imposing structure of black brick, with a bright timber interior and a retractable roof. Take a guided tour for fine rooftop views of the city, or catch a surtitled play within. See teatrszekspirowski.pl BEST EXHIBITION Exhibitionism This Rolling Stones retrospective opened in London in 2016 to huge crowds. It is now in New York, and slated for an Australian visit in 2018. Exhaustive, and occasionally exhausting, it offers music fans a staggering bounty of Stones artefacts: posters, guitars, art work, photographs, and even a recreation of their scummy 1960s London flat. The costumes are particularly fascinating, and a concert film in 3D is brilliantly done, with Jagger slobbering right in your face. See stonesexhibitionism.com BEST ART MUSEUM San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (SFMOMA), US Yet another reason to visit San Francisco is to peruse the seven floors of the magnificently enhanced Museum of Modern Art. Designed by Norwegian architecture firm Snøhetta, there's plenty of natural sunlight and vistas to enjoy moments of repose between viewing the greatest hits of modern art. The marriage of art, landscape and architecture is most impressive in the Alexander Calder Motion Lab where colourful mobiles gently twirl in front of a giant living wall. You'll need more than a day to see it all. See sfmoma.org See: Inside San Francisco's new museum MISCELLANEOUS BEST SPA TREATMENT The Goddess at Gwinganna, Queensland Jodie Wagner's The Goddess at Gwinganna treatment, launched in 2016, is much more than just a spa treatment. Jodie is passionate about helping women rediscover their feminine essence and her two-hour sessions are all about reawakening that powerful force. She combines Ka Huna massage with hot stones, essential oils, chakra awareness and body reading, but it's her chanting and singing that takes the experience to a metamorphic level. Prepare to walk out a different person. See gwinganna.com See: How the peace of Gwinganna keeps you coming back BEST SERVICE Ski valet at Falls Creek, Victoria Victoria's largest alpine resort, Falls Creek is famed for its ski-in-ski-out environment. However this works only if there's enough of the white stuff around and if you have adequate experience to get down to a lift without breaking a limb. For absolute beginners, it simply doesn't work. Falls Creek's answer is Ski Valet, at the base of the Falls Express chair, where you can store hired gear overnight free of charge. It means you can move around the resort in comfortable footwear and is, especially, a blessing for families where beleaguered parents would otherwise be schlepping everyone's cumbersome equipment.

There are beautiful old buildings set on perfectly manicured estates, where staff are attentive and there's a sense of classical opulence to the whole experience. And then there's Nairobi's Giraffe Manor, which is all of those things, plus giraffes. This is part hotel, part giraffe sanctuary, and guests come for one amazing experience: eating breakfast in the company of these beautiful, inquisitive creatures.

Valley Park Mayor Michael A. Pennise sent a letter to residents and business owners Thursday afternoon, saying a mandatory evacuation that went into effect Tuesday will be lifted at 8 a.m. Friday. But he advised the city will continue to monitor a secondary crest that’s expected on the Meramec after this week’s rain. “Please exercise caution in the levee protected areas as city maintenance crews are still working to pump some storm water levee detention basins,” Pennise said. “For the business owners affected south of the Meramec River, the city asks you to respect them by not driving in the immediate area while they clean up and recover after this flooding event.” Crews are clearing roads of debris to get them reopened, the mayor said. The river crested in Valley Park at 43.31 feet early Wednesday. It had dropped below 36 feet by Thursday night. After a second crest on Sunday at about 32 feet, the river was forecast to drop to 12 feet there by next Thursday, illustrating how quickly the Meramec can swell and shrink. ‘Better than last time’ In downtown Eureka, several businesses had started cleaning up the water damage. But the sandbags will remain, said Don Tomnitz, assistant chief with the Eureka Fire Protection District. Scott Barthelmass of the Eureka Fire Department said the concern isn’t more flooding, but rather safety with respect to the continuing rain. Removing the sandbags can wait. The river was at 34.5 feet late Thursday after cresting at 46.11 feet Tuesday night. The river was expected to continue dropping. Still, a second, smaller crest is expected over the weekend. That crest was forecast at about 34 feet. The levels of damage varied greatly. Chick-n-Elly’s fried chicken restaurant did not take in any water. The owners hope to open on Saturday. The office of Shelter Insurance agent Steve Parker got 41 inches of water. When the flood happened in December 2015, he was away on vacation and came back to find everything damaged. This time, employees were able to move the furniture and other items out of harm’s way, leaving the damage primarily to the carpet, which was being torn out Thursday morning. At St. Francis’ Episcopal Church, workers were cutting away drywall and rolling out carpet soaked by water that rose to 4 feet. All the items at ground level had been moved to safety prior to the flood. Across the region, schools and roads remained closed as floodwater continued making commutes near the river a challenge. However, both lanes of Interstate 55 running through Jefferson County were open. In Arnold, residents were praising city leaders and utility companies for being better prepared than when floods pummeled the area 16 months ago. Michael Doutre, of the 2300 block of Boeing Drive, said that in December 2015 water filled his basement and made its way into the main level of the house. This go-around, three pumps running in his basement kept the water out of the rest of the house. “This is a whole lot better than last time,” Doutre said as he and neighbors cleaned up. Because authorities did a better job of predicting the flood and warning residents it was coming, Doutre said he was able to move furniture and other items into a neighbor’s house where high water was not expected. The added time allowed neighbors to build sandbag walls and get pumps in place. But flood damage twice within two years was too much for some residents. “Every 500 year flood? Shouldn’t it be like every 15 month flood?” said Keith Roeder, who lives on Electra Drive with his wife, Stacy Robinson. Three weeks ago, they had finally finished basement repairs from the December 2015 flood, which included new drywall and turning a bedroom into a home office. This time, water and sewage rose more than 2 feet. It wiped out the inventory of Robinson’s bath salts business, and the couple are considering moving. “We can’t live with this,” Roeder said. The river crested at 45.62 inches near Interstate 55 in Arnold on Wednesday afternoon, a bit short of the 46-foot forecast. Southbound lanes of I-55 closed about noon Wednesday and reopened early Thursday. The northbound lanes never closed. The river was forecast to remain at between 41 and 45 feet through the weekend with additional rain. A sigh of relief In Pacific, much of the water downtown had drained. City officials were inspecting homes and checking with Ameren to get electricity turned back on, according to City Administrator Steve Roth. City officials estimated more than 150 homes and businesses were damaged by the flood. In 2015, that number was more than 200, but some of those buildings were demolished because of damage. The river was at about 21 feet in Pacific late Thursday, after a crest of 33.05 feet on Tuesday. A second crest at about 25 feet is expected over the weekend due to additional rain. Throughout the region, relieved authorities warned that flood-prone areas were not completely out of the woods. A flash flood watch remained in effect through Friday morning for a large swath of the area including the Metro East, St. Louis city and the Missouri counties of St. Louis, St. Charles, Jefferson and Lincoln. Kristen Taketa, Ashley Jost and Jesse Bogan of the Post-Dispatch contributed to this report.

Popular Mechanics reports. Continue reading original article The Military & Aerospace Electronics take: 4 May 2017 -- "NASA has been kind of stuck for much of the last decade," says Jack Burns, who serves as a member of President Trump's NASA transition team. "After the space shuttle stopped flying, people were even confused as to whether NASA existed any longer -- I mean it was that bad." On a recent visit to the University of Colorado at Boulder where Burns teaches and works, Popular Mechanics sat down with the astrophysics professor to learn a little about what we can expect from NASA in the coming years. Up first: flying people to space again. American astronauts haven't flown to orbit on an American launch vehicle since the last Space Shuttle flight in July 2011. Since then, NASA astronauts have been hitching rides on the Russian Soyuz rocket, and the U.S. has been paying for the privilege. The new NASA wants to change that.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 4 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) Industry – Top winning Stratergies of key Investors Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Market Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), commonly referred as drones, are aircraft without a human pilot aboard. The flight is controlled either autonomously, or by an onboard computer, or by remote control from the ground or another vehicle. The large-sized remotely pilot aircraft (RPA) are powered by internal combustion engines, while relatively small UAVs are driven by electric motors. Such small electric-powered UAVs are mainly used for military and defense applications, as without combustion, they produce low sound and are, hence, found to be more suitable for spy missions. In addition, there has been an increasing interest in civilian or commercial applications of UAVs, such as aerial photography, agriculture, 3D mapping, and wildlife protection. Research analysts forecast the global UAV market to grow at a CAGR of 12.7% during the period 2017-2021.

As both a Festival Director and Producer I was keen to see an event that spanned 11 days encompassed, music, digital, film creative industries and encompassed the whole city of Austin, and to see for myself the SXSW model seen as an exemplar for regeneration around the world. Let us continue to embrace what we love about this city. So the trip was about making connections, learning from others and seeing how we can showcase our talent to the world with hopefully a bit of good music and Texas hospitality thrown in. For eleven days the city rocked, the music was loud, varied and spilled out into garage forecourts, backyards with over a 1,000 licenses distributed by Austin City Hall. Hipsters, gamers and musicians were interchangeable, with the exception of the rucksack and the foot attire (cowboy boots for hipsters and trainers for those who know the peril of 11 days running from venue to venue), marking out which part of the festival the attendees were registered for. The festival is immense and attracts over a million people, it showcases local, national and international talent with pop up embassies from the UK, Germany and many more countries. Austin as a city has embraced this event, it created this event but it also carried a warning sticker ‘Keep Austin Weird’ as it realises the very grassroots ecology that created this phenomenon was being priced out or alienated from the success story it created. It reminded me of my time at the University of Pittsburgh as a visiting Professor, our twin city and arguably the regeneration story of how a post-industrial city has found a new narrative, but where the newly cleaned gleaming buildings reclaimed from years of industrial pollution sit alongside slogans urging the city fathers to ‘keep Pittsburgh Dirty’. I could see lessons for Sheffield in both these great American cities, the post-industrial landscape of Pittsburgh regenerated by becoming the healthcare capital of the US, crossed with the musical heritage of Austin which has created spawned a thousand imitators. But Sheffield does not seek to imitate other cities or transplant wholesale concepts from its neighbours but only has to look within to see what can be achieved. So we can learn from Austin and Pittsburgh and many other magnet creative cities in the world but we do not need to copy them or became an inferior version. As the city is reborn, as Attercliffe is renamed East Sheffield, our city centre becoming home to 23,400 people and has won three national awards for safety with an increase of 3,900 new jobs in the past five years, let us continue to embrace what we love about this city. Its great universities who play an increasingly important role as place makers not only for our students but for our staff and residents and the people of Sheffield. Our world leading Advanced Manufacturing Park, home to the University of Sheffield’s AMRC and creating world class partnerships with Boeing Rolls Royce and now Maclaren. The wonderful parks and countryside used by the 10,000 climbers and 14,000 park runners based in our green and pleasant city, one third of which is situated in a National Park. A city which is home to the incredible Sheffield theatres, the largest theatre complex outside London, with its three stages presenting over 700 performances a year. Keep Sheffield Real, allow space for the creatives, and maintain the spirit of independence and quirkiness that sets us apart from our shinier Northern counterparts. To celebrate a city where students are embraced as locals, where 75 per cent of the beer made in the City is consumed in the city but the ambition of a new bottling and canning unit can allow us to export it to the world. Enable a city centre where our fantastic independent offer as showcased in the recent publication This is Sheffield from the Sheffield BID which highlights our bars, cafes, bookshops, retail and food offer and sits alongside the newly emerging retail quarter and the regeneration of the Moor.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 4 May 2017 by Rahul Jadhav Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) Markets Offer Increasing Growth Opportunities Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), commonly referred as drones, are aircraft without a human pilot aboard. The flight is controlled either autonomously, or by an onboard computer, or by remote control from the ground or another vehicle. The large-sized remotely pilot aircraft (RPA) are powered by internal combustion engines, while relatively small UAVs are driven by electric motors. Such small electric-powered UAVs are mainly used for military and defense applications, as without combustion, they produce low sound and are, hence, found to be more suitable for spy missions. In addition, there has been an increasing interest in civilian or commercial applications of UAVs, such as aerial photography, agriculture, 3D mapping, and wildlife protection. Research analysts forecast the global UAV market to grow at a CAGR of 12.7% during the period 2017-2021.

Friday, May 5, 2017 Latest: World Domestic Politics – OpEd UN Study Accuses Israel Of ‘Distorting’ Palestinian Economy The North Korean Nuclear Conundrum – Analysis Saudi Arabia: Women No Longer Need Guardians’ Consent To Receive Services Deceit, Betrayal And The Left: The ‘Traitor Of The Year Award’ – OpEd Eurasia Review A Journal of Analysis and News News Opinion Analysis Business Social Religion Entertainment Environment Technology About Editorial Staff Authors and Partners Contact Submit an Article Buzz Future Privacy Policy And Terms Of Use 1 Opinion  US Shooting Itself In Foot With Sanctions Against Eurasia – OpEd May 4, 2017 Rahul Manchanda 0 Comment Armenia, Azerbaijan, Banking, China, Economics, Foreign Policy, Georgia, Khazakstan, Russia, Turkey, United States By Rahul Manchanda If average Americans could visit the sprawling countries of Eurasia, including Russia, Khazakstan, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Armenia, Turkey, China, and other nations, they would quickly surmise that those nations are literally drenched in oil, gas, minerals, and natural resource wealth which is literally just begging to be developed and marketed in the international stream of commerce. Brand new buildings, with the latest advances in structural and physical ingenuity, dot the landscape of these nations, being commissioned and put up by the latest geniuses who brought us the towers in Dubai and other fabulously wealthy nations in the East, while the infrastructure and architecture of the United States and Great Britain lay in self-pleased antiquity and junky comparison. The United States has always been a nation of progress, ingenuity, discovery, wonder, and periodic renewal in almost each and every capacity for growth and development, but for some reason, the kernel of genius and wisdom so carefully inserted into the U.S. Constitution and Bill of Rights by the Founding Fathers has been subverted and stifled by the International Central Bankers and their minions within the Executive, Legislative, and Judicial Branch, as well as its lapdog corporate Mainstream Media, to literally prevent and paralyze America from joining in this absolute financial and economic boom currently underway in Eurasia. Even though the United States has the most advanced technological abilities to fully assist and help develop the natural resources and markets of all of the countries that the short-sighted and idiotic U.S. Treasury Department on its own is waging a “sanction war” against, American corporations and its employees are being held back and kept out of the loop by various members of the U.S. Government itself, who are often shareholders and members of the Board of Directors of those foreign companies from Eurasian nations, who are in fact, making a “killing” on these new and emerging and developing markets going on right now. The stench and sickness of hypocrisy in denying the American citizenry the boons and benefits of this newfound wealth and natural resource prosperity by their U.S. Treasury masters with idiotic and counterproductive sanctions is truly mind-boggling, while these governmental economic suppressors continue to take part in and financially benefit, through their own corporate and international cronyism, in these burgeoning industries. These idiots within the U.S. Treasury Department, using their half-educated nimrods within the U.S. Congress and Senate, continue to pump out international economic stifling sanctions, seemingly 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days per year, under the idiotic appellation and specious banner of “combating international Islamic terrorism,” against certain nations which, if the USA actively encouraged trade and friendly relationships with, would yield untold and limitless bountiful economic fruit to all segments of the U.S. economic sector and its people, but again these “harbingers of doom” working within the U.S. Government would rather deprive their fellow American citizenry while all the while having one foot in the Eurasian economic door through their international relationships overseas. And “international Islamic terrorism” has also been revealed to be simply a disruptive “boogeyman” created, funded, armed, trained and dispatched by our friendly neighborhood International Central Bankers and their equally stooge-like Intelligence Services for precisely this purpose, to foment conflict, division, and provocation so that they can use variously selected, idiotic, and shortsighted world leaders to sanction, embargo, invade and terrorize other world nations not towing the proverbial line of their international and global agenda. For example, in Azerbaijan, Georgia, Khazakstan, and other oil/gas rich nations, we are constantly repressing and sanctioning integral nations such as Iran, Russia, Syria, Belarus, Balkans, China, Kyrgyzstan, Venezuela, and scores of other nations who are being idiotically alienated and provoked with financially crippling U.S. embargoes and sanctions, instead of enjoying full diplomatic relations in the spirit of working together, thus hitting all Americans directly where it counts the most – in their pocket book. George Washington, in his Farewell Address, stated that “it is our true policy to steer clear of permanent alliance with any portion of the foreign world.” Thomas Jefferson, at his Inauguration, pledged “peace, commerce, and honest friendship with all nations-entangling alliances with none.” It is quite striking when one of our most powerful and wealthy American companies, Boeing, can not even sell its passenger airplanes to a country like Iran, potentially making trillions of dollars and creating hundreds of thousands of high-paying U.S. jobs, just because a handful of disloyal and crony members of the U.S. Treasury and their minions in the U.S. Legislature carry out their bidding and prevent them all from doing business, thus driving this massively lucrative business and jobs creation directly into the hands of Airbus, Europe’s number one passenger airline company, to the tune of trillions of dollars in current and future revenue. But this is only one example out of thousands of U.S. Corporations and Foreign Nations that they target. But our counterproductive sanctions and embargoes against so many different nations, under the dubious guise of “terrorism,” rather than through direct problem solving, conflict resolution, and resolute negotiation procedures through diplomacy and communication, are having the ultimate and pernicious effect of leaving America in the economic and financial dirt, while augmenting and increasing the economic and logistical development of the nations (and their friends) that we are targeting. However this might be the grand game and goal of the International Central Bankers in their international economic chess game, in the first place. ← The Risks Of Growing Urbanization – OpEd Post-May Day Thoughts: Need To Distinguish Between Organized And Unorganized Classes – OpEd → Rahul Manchanda Rahul D.

The Airplane left Tehran’s International Imam Khomeini Airport at 7:30 local time for Stockholm, Sweden, reported Irna, the official Iranian news agency. Following the implementation of Iran nuclear deal – known as JCPOA – and the removal of arbitrary sanctions on Tehran, Iran Air began renovating its fleet signing contracts for purchase of 200 modern airplanes from Boeing, Airbus and ATR. Three of the purchased planes from the French aircraft manufacturer have been delivered to Iran Air so far, two of which are Airbus 330 and the other one is Airbus 321 with 190 seats and is being used in domestic lines. Boeing is also due to deliver the first aircraft to the Iranian national carrier in 2018, the report said, noting that four of the planes purchased from ATR are scheduled to arrive in the country within the next few days.   Tags: Iran Air | Airbus A330 | More Travel, Tourism & Hospitality Stories Ministry of Health & Prevention organises 8th Travel Road Exhibition Drager named GM of Shangri-La Al Husn Resort Get Dubai Parks and Resorts summer flash sale tickets from $20 Middle East Airlines, Turkish Airlines ink codeshare deal Madinat Jumeirah welcomes new managing director Jazeera posts $2.9m net loss for Q1 ME carriers see slowdown in air travel demand Action Hotels to develop fourth property in Australia Dubai Airports hosts first Airline Excellence Awards Special Ramadan offers at Millennium Airport Hotel Dubai Luxury weddings a 'key segment of tourism sector' Abu Dhabi targets Chinese tourist market Mövenpick Istanbul Golden Horn offers exclusive Ramadan services Flydubai to add new destinations to summer schedule Qatar Airways named official airline partner of electric street racing series AirBaltic appoints new PR head Bahrain showcases local craftsmanship at Tunisian handicrafts events Etihad boosts capacity to Kerala City Seasons Group of Hotels welcomes new group sales head New GM for Mercure Grand Hotel Doha City Centre Incredible India eyes ME tourists UAE, Saudi Arabia top destinations for UK travellers Middle East freight demand up 16.3pc in March Hawthorn Suites by Wyndham JBR welcomes new team members Jazeera tops ‘On-Time Performance' list for ME UAE ranked 2nd most popular destination for Muslim travellers New Universal Orlando hotel to open in 2018 summer New water theme park set to open in US this month Thailand’s Muslim-friendly travel app now in Arabic Asaas to build key facility at Muscat airport Calendar of Events View all events Tools Exchange Rates Weather Forecast BBC World Service Ads Sectors | Information | About Us | Construction & Real Estate Energy, Oil & Gas Finance & Capital Market Industry & Logistics IT & Telecommunication Health & Environment Motoring Retail & Wholesale Travel, Tourism & Hospitality Government & Laws Media & Promotion Back to top Trade News Newsletter Events Business Directory TradeArabia Network Advertising Contact Feedback Privacy Statement Terms of Service Web Feeds

This sponsorship reflects the importance of the Mexican National Team for the country and our upcoming partnership with Delta. We are excited to launch this new sponsorship and look forward to the benefits it will bring to our customers and employees," said Anko van der Werff, Chief Revenue Officer at Aeromexico.

Skip to Navigation St. Louis Review Search: Archdiocese of Saint Louis Twitter Facebook RSS Rookie all-girls robotics team put Frank Sobotra to the test Submitted on May 04, 2017 By Joseph Kenny | jkenny@archstl.org | twitter: @josephkenny2 Frank Sabotra, the robot built by Ursuline Academy students (6391), competed under the remote direction of, from left, Libby Trn, Amanda Kohne and Elizabeth Edmunds. The Ursuline Academy Bearbotics team battled other robots in the competition venue and was recognized earlier as a “Chairman’s Award team in the making.” Sid Hastings Related Articles:  A series of "FIRSTS" for robotics team at Rosati-Kain High School The students and their coach yelled and leaped for joy when Frank Sabotra climbed a rope and turned on a light just before a buzzer sounded. Frank is a robot, built and programmed by 10 students who are part of Ursuline Academy's robotics team — the Ursuline Bearbotics — the only all-girls team in Missouri to compete in the FIRST Robotics Championshp at America's Center in Downtown St. Louis April 26-29. The Bearbotics earlier earned distinction as FIRST's top rookie team in the St. Louis Regional in March at Chaifetz Arena, qualifying for the championship with 407 teams, including 18 from Missouri and five from the St. Louis area. Frank, a box-like mix of metal and wires with padded bumpers, participated in 10 preliminary rounds of competition. He hit a snag on the first day when he crashed into another robot frantically making its rounds in "the pit" to perform tasks. But in this round on April 28 and guided by one of the team members, Frank performed flawlessly, sending sprockets up a path to turn rotors, shooting balls and climbing the rope. Though the competition is important, the experience with teams from across the world is much more comprehensive, said freshman Amanda Kohne, safety leader for the Ursuline team. "It's a great opportunity," Kohne said. "I met people from Quebec, Philadelphia ... We came here as a family of 10 and left as a family of 400." Senior Emma Jane Douthitt, mechanical leader of the team, applied the skills her grandfather taught her about working on cars. As a member of the Bearbotics team, she learned a lot more, however. "I used to not be very good at directions, and now I am," said Douthitt, who is interested in studying mechanical engineering at Western Kentucky University, where she'll attend in the fall. Senior Claire Roberson, assistant team leader, followed FIRST Competition for a few years and wanted to start a team at Ursuline. Her chance came when Shane Hanson was hired to teach physics and engineering. He had been a mentor for FIRST at another school. The new FIRST club at Ursuline has a good foundation despite being in its first year, Roberson said. Roberson gained confidence in using tools, especially power tools, and learned electrical wiring. She was "astounded" when Frank worked when they tested him. "To see that something we built could work and we could drive was so cool," Roberson said. And when she learned her team was moving on from regionals to the championships against teams from around the country, "I was so happy I practically ran down to receive our award," said Roberson, who plans to major in aerospace engineering at Wichita State University in Kansas. "This really confirmed and solidified that this is what I want to do." She'd like Ursuline's success to inspire other Catholic girls schools to form teams. "It's not just a man's world. Women can do anything they want. They can be engineers, mechanics, whatever they want with their lives regardless of stereotypes," she said. The teams at various schools help each other. Ursuline relied on assistance from Rosati-Kain and Nerinx Hall high schools in particular prior to the championship and other schools while there. Under strict rules, limited resources and a six-week time limit, teams of students are challenged to raise funds, design a team "brand," hone teamwork skills, and build and program industrial-size robots. It's considered as close to real-world engineering as a student can get. Volunteer professional mentors lend their time and talents to guide each team. Scott Edmunds, an engineer at Boeing and dad of one of the team members, helped guide the Bearbotics. Junior Madison Yakstis is the team leader. Other members are freshmen Kelly Zipfel, Elizabeth Edmunds and Mary Weissert, sophomores Anna Gonsalves and Libby Trn and junior Caeley Kates. The students' joy when Frank performed his tasks made the time and effort worthwhile. "The thing I enjoy most is their excitement," Hanson said.  Ursuline Academy earned the Rookie All-Star Award during the St. Louis Regional FIRST Robotics Competition at Chaifetz Arena in March. The award recognizes a strong partnership effort between students and sponsors and their understanding and promotion of the mission of FIRST to inspire students to enjoy and learn more about science and technology. The team was interviewed by the regional judges, designed and created a robot appropriate to the game's challenges, and, based upon students' leadership, vision and spirit, qualified as a "Chairman's Award team in the making." Inventor Dean Kamen founded FIRST (For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology) in 1989. Based in Manchester, N.H., FIRST seeks to build self-confidence, knowledge and life skills while motivating young people to pursue opportunities in science, technology and engineering. With support from more than 200 Fortune 500 companies and more than $50 million in college scholarships, the not-for-profit organization hosts the FIRST Robotics Competition for students in grades 9-12; FIRST Tech Challenge for grades 7-12; FIRST LEGO League for grades 4-8; and FIRST LEGO League Jr. for grades K-4. The main sponsors of Ursuline's team were Monsanto, Boeing, Girl Scouts of Eastern Missouri and the Mercy Health Foundation St. Louis.

Evans told a U.S. Senate commerce subcommittee that the April 9 removal of Dr. David Dao was "deeply saddening and personally offensive." The department suspended four employees in the incident and said neither the Chicago Police Department nor airport security officers will go on aircraft to deal with customer service matters including overbooking. The harsh criticism of United extended to the entire airline industry as senators criticized airline fees, customer service flaps and the lack of competition in the heavily consolidated sector. "Here we are, with an industry facing self-inflicted PR problems, sitting before us asking for our forgiveness and to allow them to fix their own problems," Democratic Senator Bill Nelson of Florida said at the hearing of the Subcommittee on Aviation Operation, Safety, and Security. Since Dao was dragged off United Flight 3411 to make room for airline employees, lawmakers have threatened to increase oversight on the largely deregulated industry. United again sought to stop congressional legislation, with its president, Scott Kirby, testifying on Thursday - apologizing again to Dao and his family and promising the airline will improve conditions for customers. United has said it will no longer call security to remove non-threatening passengers from planes and will offer up to $10,000 for volunteers to forfeit their seats on overbooked flights. Republican Senator Roy Blunt of Missouri, the subcommittee chairman, said the panel was trying to determine how much leeway to give to airlines to make changes on their own, versus "what needs to be taken care of in federal law itself." Democratic Senators Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut and Edward Markey of Massachusetts said they planned to introduce a new passenger bill of rights that would place limits on airlines' ability to impose "ridiculous" fees for baggage, ticket changes and cancellations. Beyond the April 9 incident, the airline industry was repeatedly censured by senators for customer service failures, including cutting leg room by cramming additional seats onto jets. American Airlines's new Boeing jets will add seats, cutting two inches of leg room from some economy seats, it has said. The airline did not send a representative to the hearing on Thursday.

second test-firing of Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missile The US Air Force (USAF) has conducted a further test-fire of an unarmed Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) equipped with a single test re-entry vehicle. On 3 May, the latest test launch was conducted from the Vandenberg Air Force Base (AFB), California, following a similar test-firing carried out on 26 April. The test launches validate the accuracy and reliability of the ICBM weapon system, while the data collected will be used by the US Department of Defense, the Department of Energy, and US Strategic Command for continuing force development evaluation. A team of Air Force Global Strike Command airmen carried out the launch from the 341st Missile Wing at Malmstrom Air Force Base, Montana. 30th Space Wing commander colonel Chris Moss said: "The dedication and expertise of the combined 341st Missile Wing, 576th Flight Test Squadron and 30th Space Wing team is simply amazing. "Their efforts to make this mission possible over the past ten months shows why they are some of the most skilled operators in the Air Force." “Their efforts to make this mission possible over the past ten months shows why they are some of the most skilled operators in the Air Force." Consisting of a telemetry package used for operational testing, the re-entry vehicle travelled approximately 4,200 miles to the Kwajalein Atoll in the Marshall Islands. The ICBM test launch programme is conducted to demonstrate the operational capability of the Minuteman III, while it is also said to ensure the country's ability to maintain a strong, credible nuclear deterrent as a key element of national security and the security of its allies and partners. The Boeing-built Minuteman III is a ground-based strategic impediment that is intended to replace the USAF's LGM-30G Minuteman III ICBM weapon system. Expected to enter service in 2027, the missile will remain in use until 2075.

ROS LBoard 1 Selangor is shaky, says Najib FMT Reporters Read More FMT BAHASA FMT BORNEO+ FMT VIDEO CONTRIBUTE NEWS HOME NATION OPINION WORLD LEISURE SPORTS BUSINESS ADVERTISE WITH US New routes, more staff for Malaysia Airlines by year-end Reuters | May 4, 2017 CEO Peter Bellew says company evaluating at least 26 more routes that could be introduced by 2018. KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysia Airlines will add 11 new routes and embark on a hiring spree by year-end amid a boost in demand from international customers, Chief Executive Peter Bellew said on Wednesday. The Malaysian national carrier is in the midst of a turnaround after suffering two tragedies in 2014 – when flight MH370 from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing mysteriously disappeared, and flight MH17 from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur was shot down in eastern Ukraine. Bellew said the number of routes being introduced now was the most in a single year in the airline’s history, and that the company was evaluating at least 26 more routes that could be introduced by 2018. The airline, he said, was seeing an increase in customers in Asia, particularly from China, India and Australia, despite a fall in the number of fliers to Europe and the United States. Malaysia Airlines was looking to hire more staff towards the end of this year and add several wide-body aircraft to its fleet. However, he did not discuss on how many jobs would be introduced. The company was de-listed from the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange in 2014, and had removed around 6,000 jobs, at least a third of its workforce, at the peak of the airline’s crisis in 2015. “Business is very good at the moment… business on the international front is extremely strong,” he told reporters in Putrajaya, Malaysia’s administrative capital. “We need more pilots, more crew, engineers and everything.” Last month, Bellew told Reuters the airline was looking to lease between six and eight Airbus A330s or Boeing 777s for use from 2018 and another seven to nine aircraft from 2019. The company aims at a return to profitability by 2018, and a stock market listing again in March the following year.
