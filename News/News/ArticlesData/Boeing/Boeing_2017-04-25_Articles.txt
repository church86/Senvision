WASHINGTON (Sputnik) — US aerospace giant Boeing has received a nearly $50 million contract to extend the service life of the Super-Hornet combat jets beyond the original flight hour service life, the Department of Defense said in a press release. "The Boeing Company [of] St. Louis, Missouri, is being awarded a $49.7 million… [contract] to extend the service life of the F/A-18E/F beyond the original design of the 6,000 flight hour service life,” the release stated on Tuesday. © Photo: Lockheed Martin NeverEnding Story: Pentagon Awards $109M to Upgrade F-35's Hardware, SoftwareUS Defense Secretary James Mattis ordered a comparison of the hugely expensive and controversial Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II Joint Strike Aircraft and the F/A-18 not long after President Donald Trump was inaugurated. Around the same time Boeing which manufactures the F/A-18, circulated a document suggesting that the Navy had a "significant capability gaps against emerging threats" with the F-35, according to the Navy Times, and that updating the F/A-18 was more efficient that buying new F-35s. ...

 Apple might compete with SpaceX in an unexpected business Evan Niu, The Motley Fool Apr. 25, 2017, 6:44 PM 2,389 facebook linkedin twitter email print A SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket lifting off. Joe Skipper/Reuters Investors already know that Apple is actively searching for its next big hit, be it autonomous electric cars, augmented reality, or a toaster-refrigerator. There's now a clue of another possible idea floating around Cupertino: space internet. Bloomberg reported on Friday that Apple has poached two high-level Alphabet executives that worked on satellite and spacecraft projects for Google, John Fenwick and Michael Trela. Trela served as Google's head of satellite engineering from August 2014 to March 2017, according to his LinkedIn profile. Fenwick was Google's head of spacecraft operations over the same time frame, according to his LinkedIn profile. Neither executive's profile has been updated to mention Apple. Apple may have "potential interest in space" The report notes that aerospace giant Boeing has expressed interest in pursuing space internet with a network of 1,000 satellites, saying that Boeing has held talks with Apple as a potential investor and partner. Apple may in fact be helping fund the project, according to Bloomberg, citing a blog post from satellite and telecom consultant Tim Farrar, but Apple's involvement beyond that is unclear. Farrar wrote last month, "Boeing has also indicated to these people that it does not need export credit funding for the project, which supports the idea that this project is backed by a deep pocketed US entity." After ruling out other tech giants that have expressed extraterrestrial interest, Farrar concludes, "That only leaves Apple as never having discussed publicly its potential interest in space." Apple does have the deepest pockets of any company on Earth, after all. Tim Cook vs. Elon Musk This all comes a few months after The Wall Street Journal got ahold of leaked financials for Elon Musk's SpaceX, which is privately held. Of course, SpaceX's primary mission is to achieve full and rapid reusability of rockets in order to realize massive reductions in the cost of space travel, which the company hopes will pave the way for subsequent colonization of Mars. The business is currently built on launch contracts, but the internal information that was obtained shows that SpaceX has lofty ambitions for creating a satellite internet business within a matter of years, potentially starting as early as 2019. SpaceX's projections estimate that the service could garner 40 million subscribers and generate over $30 billion in revenue by 2025, according to the report. In contrast, the launch business is only expected to bring in $5 billion in sales that year, meaning that SpaceX believes that there's much more financial opportunity in beaming space internet down to Earth than launching reusable rockets. Operating income is forecast between $20 billion and $25 billion in 2025, which would largely be driven by the new business. The company had previously disclosed plans to launch over 4,400 satellites into low-Earth orbit to deliver low-latency internet from space, but had not mentioned financial expectations. Apple has been wanting to grow services revenue People have been dreaming of space internet for over a decade, and there have been many casualties over the years. But as things tend to go in technology, things change rapidly over time, and that rate of change only accelerates. Falling costs have opened up the potential for a new wave of space entrepreneurs; start-up OneWeb raised $1.2 billion last year to build and launch a space internet network. It's entirely possible that Apple has something else in mind, but given the company's heavy emphasis on services in recent quarters, it seems conceivable that Apple sees potential in building a strong base of recurring revenue from a literal moonshot like space internet. However, even if you accept SpaceX's forecast, $30 billion still isn't a game changer on Apple's income statement, although it would be a welcome addition to the services segment (currently a $25 billion business). There would immense costs associated with building such a constellation, but the Mac maker is currently sitting on the most cash that it's ever had ($246 billion at last count, before factoring in debt). Space internet revenue also wouldn't have as high of margins compared to Apple's terrestrial services, given these costs. Still, I'm hoping that Apple one day announces "the most extraterrestrial service we've ever made." 10 stocks we like better than Apple When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade, Motley Fool Stock Advisor, has tripled the market.* David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the ten best stocks for investors to buy right now… and Apple wasn't one of them!

Fiji Time: 7:05 PM on Wednesday 26 April Home Politics Local Sport World Letters Editorial Nai Lalakai Business Features Classifieds Weather Gallery Archives / Front page / Business Ready to fly Reuters Wednesday, April 26, 2017 THE COMAC C919 jet is expected to stage its maiden flight in the coming weeks, and foreign media and potential buyers will be invited in force — illustrating how Beijing is adjusting to competition for a slice of global jet sales worth $2 trillion over the next 20 years. But after three years of delays and almost a decade in development, China's answer to the Boeing 737 and its state-owned designers face a daunting phase: selling the jet abroad in a market dominated by Boeing (BA.N) and Airbus (AIR.PA). "They will be trying to compete on price against people who are building aircraft at a much faster pace and with more experience, so there's a risk of getting bled dry," said Richard Aboulafia, aerospace analyst at Virginia-based Teal Group. Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC) has some cards to play: its plane has Western engines and avionics coupled with a new design; it's rolling out a pilot training program, expanding international staff and has strong, behind-the-scenes backing from Beijing, industry executives say. And though still unproven, COMAC could be the single biggest threat over the coming decades to the dominance of Boeing and Airbus, both in China's own huge aviation market and, longer-term, overseas. The C919 is the first step to this. Beijing's backing for the single-aisle plane gives COMAC a springboard in the world's fastest-growing domestic market, even though the company acknowledges much bigger hurdles abroad. "You can't compare us to Boeing or Airbus, they're in a different strategic stage... We took half a century to solve the first strategic issue (of plane development), it will also take many years to solve the second (market) problem," said Jeff Cheng, a spokesman for COMAC. "After the first flight, we have to focus and research on how to improve the plane's and COMAC's market competitiveness." Eric Chen, president of Airbus Commercial Aircraft China, welcomed the competition from COMAC, and a China-based spokesman for Boeing congratulated the company on developing the C919.

Roselle Chen reports. ▲ Hide Transcript ▶ View Transcript Boeing is close to launching the 737 MAX 10X to counter strong sales of the Airbus A321neo, sources told Reuters. The plan is to unveil the new jet at the Paris Airshow in June. Reuters sources say, Boeing is talking to airlines and expects to sell 1,000 of the fuel-efficient, long-range planes. It could begin delivery in 2020 if airlines start ordering this year. But, asked for comment, Boeing said no decision has been taken, and it's too early to talk about launch. Travel industry analyst Henry Harteveldt (SPUNDBITE) HENRY H. HARTEVELDT, PRESIDENT & TRAVEL INDUSTRY ANALYST, ATMOSPHERE RESEARCH GROUP (ENGLISH) SAYING: "It's a long-haul airplane. It's not designed to be short-haul flying. And Boeing wants this to be competitive, both for defensive reasons to get sales that would otherwise go to Airbus, but also it's a stop-gap in the Boeing product mix. Right now, the largest plane that Boeing has is the 737 MAX 9, which can carry approximately 189 - 200 people, and, while that's good, some airlines want more capacity." The 737 jetliner has been Boeing's best selling product for the past fifty years. The company is making four new 737 versions, including MAX 10X. But the new planes are coming to market just as demand for aircraft has slowed.

ATSG Subsidiary PEMCO Launches B737-700 FlexCombi™ & Full-Freighter Aircraft Conversion Programs PEMCO World Air Services offers two conversion programs for the Boeing Next Generation 737-700 aircraft: the Passenger-to-Freighter (B737-700F) conversion and the Passenger-to-FlexCombi™ (B737-700FC) conversion. (Photo: Business Wire) Download Full Size Small Preview Thumbnail April 25, 2017 03:00 PM Eastern Daylight Time WILMINGTON, Ohio--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Aviation maintenance and engineering company PEMCO World Air Services (PEMCO), a wholly owned subsidiary of Air Transport Services Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:ATSG), has launched its Passenger-to-FlexCombi™ and Passenger-to-Freighter conversion programs for the Boeing Next Generation 737-700 aircraft. The programs will be marketed as B737-700FC (FlexCombi™) and B737-700F (Freighter). “We’re excited to finally announce the launch of our 700-series conversion programs for the Boeing 737,” said PEMCO Director of Conversion Programs Mike Andrews. “Over the past several months, we have worked closely with our customers to fully understand their requirements and implement a comprehensive solution.” The launch customer for the PEMCO B737-700FC is Bahrain-based Chisholm Enterprises, an internationally recognized provider of tailored aviation and business solutions in the Middle East. Its subsidiary Texel Air, a non-scheduled cargo airline, will operate the B737-700FC from Bahrain International Airport. “We made a significant investment to develop our specification for the FlexCombi™ to meet our operational requirements,” shared Chisholm Enterprises CEO George Chisholm. “I acknowledge the professionalism and support received from the PEMCO team during our extensive evaluation process culminating in PEMCO’s confirmation of proof of concept. This underwrote our decision to become the launch customer for the B737-700FC.” Chisholm added, “We have also worked with PEMCO as the end customer for four previous B737-300 conversions including the current two aircraft in the Texel fleet. We have benefited from the trouble-free PEMCO cargo system since 2009. We are very confident of a successful partnership with PEMCO on the B737-700FC.” PEMCO will induct the first aircraft for B737-700 Passenger-to-FlexCombi™ modification at PEMCO’s facilities in Tampa, Fla., during the second quarter of 2017. PEMCO expects to receive a U.S. Federal Aviation Administration supplemental type certification (STC) by mid-2018. After the initial issuance, PEMCO plans to certify both B737-700 conversion programs with the European Aviation Safety Agency and the Civil Aviation Administration of China shortly thereafter.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 25 April 2017 by Maciej Heyman ATSG Subsidiary PEMCO Launches B737-700 FlexCombi™ & Full-Freighter Aircraft Conversion Programs WILMINGTON, Ohio–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Aviation maintenance and engineering company PEMCO World Air Services (PEMCO), a wholly owned subsidiary of Air Transport Services Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:ATSG), has launched its Passenger-to-FlexCombi™ and Passenger-to-Freighter conversion programs for the Boeing Next Generation 737-700 aircraft. The programs will be marketed as B737-700FC (FlexCombi™) and B737-700F (Freighter). “We’re excited to finally announce the launch of our 700-series conversion programs for the Boeing 737,” said PEMCO Director of Conversion Programs Mike Andrews. “Over the past several months, we have worked closely with our customers to fully understand their requirements and implement a comprehensive solution.” The launch customer for the PEMCO B737-700FC is Bahrain-based Chisholm Enterprises, an internationally recognized provider of tailored aviation and business solutions in the Middle East. Its subsidiary Texel Air, a non-scheduled cargo airline, will operate the B737-700FC from Bahrain International Airport. “We made a significant investment to develop our specification for the FlexCombi™ to meet our operational requirements,” shared Chisholm Enterprises CEO George Chisholm. “I acknowledge the professionalism and support received from the PEMCO team during our extensive evaluation process culminating in PEMCO’s confirmation of proof of concept. This underwrote our decision to become the launch customer for the B737-700FC.” Chisholm added, “We have also worked with PEMCO as the end customer for four previous B737-300 conversions including the current two aircraft in the Texel fleet. We have benefited from the trouble-free PEMCO cargo system since 2009. We are very confident of a successful partnership with PEMCO on the B737-700FC.” PEMCO will induct the first aircraft for B737-700 Passenger-to-FlexCombi™ modification at PEMCO’s facilities in Tampa, Fla., during the second quarter of 2017. PEMCO expects to receive a U.S. Federal Aviation Administration supplemental type certification (STC) by mid-2018. After the initial issuance, PEMCO plans to certify both B737-700 conversion programs with the European Aviation Safety Agency and the Civil Aviation Administration of China shortly thereafter. The first of its kind, the PEMCO B737-700FC offers three configurations: a 24-passenger cabin plus a 2,640-cubic-foot cargo hold for up to 30,000 pounds of payload in six pallet positions; a 12-passenger cabin plus a 3,005-cubic-foot cargo hold for up to 35,000 pounds of payload in seven pallet positions; or full-freighter mode consisting of a 3,370-cubic-foot cargo hold for up to 40,000 pounds of payload in eight pallet positions.

By: Reuters | Paris | Published:April 25, 2017 10:17 pm Boeing is nearing a decision to launch a larger version of its 737 workhorse jet within two months to counter strong sales of the Airbus A321neo, after a breakthrough on the design for one of its parts, industry sources said. The 737 MAX 10 would narrow the gap between the 178-220 seat 737-9, which first flew this month, and the 185-240 seat A321neo, which dominates the top end of a market for narrowbody jets worth $2 trillion over 20 years. Boeing has been studying how to solve a tricky problem with the design of the plane’s landing gear, without adding cost or delaying a 2020 target for first deliveries. The sources said a solution had been found and that Boeing was talking more deliberately to airlines about launching the 737-10 at the Paris Airshow in June. Boeing is said to anticipate a total market of 1,000 of the planes. “Boeing is actively engaged in discussions with customers about the 737 MAX 10X,” a spokesman said. “No decision has been made on the airplane and any discussion on timing of a possible launch would be speculative.” Boeing shares were up slightly in early trading. Reuters reported last year that the 737-10 marks a tactical response to the A321neo, while Boeing works on strategic plans for a 220-260-seat twin-aisle, mid-market jet. But it has produced a puzzle so tricky that Boeing has asked for help from its combat jet experts to design a space-saving gear for the 737-10. A solution is needed because the 737-10 will be longer than the 737-9 to make room for about 12 extra seats. The landing gear must become taller too or the tail could scrape the runway. Anxious to avoid costly changes to the rest of the plane and stay on schedule, Boeing aims to make the gear longer only when needed, but small enough to fit in the 737’s existing wheel bay. It has not made final decisions but is testing an advanced proposal to allow the 737 to effectively sit back on its heels as it leaves the runway. This is what aerospace engineers call a “semi-levered” design and is a nod to two bigger jets: the 777 and 787-10. In a further twist, the gear would lengthen telescopically for the 737-10 to charge down the runway. Afterwards, it would shrink again to retract into the same space. COMPETITION IMPACT Drawing-board decisions like these feed directly into the battle for jet sales. A longer gear allows pilots to use the same take-off angle rather than easing off to avoid striking the runway with the tail of the longer jet. Shallower take-offs need more runway, limiting the number of airports served and restricting sales. Airbus, which declined comment, will try to persuade potential 737-10 buyers that it is little different from the slow-selling 737-9. It is meanwhile said to be working on its own improvements to the A320 family codenamed A320neo-plus. Market sources say Boeing is offering 5 percent lower costs per seat than the A321neo for the 737-10. Some experts are more cautious on operating costs, leaving jetmakers to slug it out over two other important drivers: range and performance. Boeing decided against using a bigger engine to boost those features and is gambling that some airlines will prefer extra seats and fly the 737-10 mainly on short routes. Although reports have focused on the clash between the A321neo and 737-9/10, industry sources say it’s not just the top end of the narrowbody market that drives the new design. Because most carriers stick to one jet family, they say Boeing seems worried the A321neo’s success could prompt fleet decisions that weaken the smaller 737 MAX 8. The 737-10 would thus be an extra rampart to defend Boeing’s biggest cash cow. “It’s a defensive move. Boeing wants to prevent the A321neo being a Trojan Horse in its own fleet,” one strategist said.

The delegation is due to fly to Boeing Renton factory in Seattle to pick up the plane and return within days to join the company's fleet, which would include 28 plane of the same model after the deal is completed. The B737/800 NGs is almost six years old and is considered one of the best-selling in the Boeing 737 family, as it has several advantages, including low fuel consumption and the ability to fly for up to six hours nonstop. Safwat Mesallam, chairman of the company, said the choice of this type of Boeing comes within the interest of promoting EgyptAir's services to clients, to improve their travel experience. The new airplane has 154 seats including 16 seats for business class. It has a front video screen for every passenger and wider spaces for carry-on luggage in the overhead bins. EgyptAir will replace the newspapers on the new airplanes with electronic applications for a number of Egyptian, Arab and international newspapers that can be browsed via each passenger’s screen. In previous statements, Mesallam explained the plan for upgrading the EgyptAir fleet targets a total of 105 aircrafts by the end of 2020 and 156 aircrafts by the end of 2025.   Tweet Printer-friendly versionSend to friend aircraft, Boeing, Egypt, EgyptAir                                             Our Recommendations Social media users infuriated by online calls disruption, NTRA denies blockage Russia grants 9 Arab countries visa-free entry, excludes Egypt In photos: Pharaonic cemetery with dozens of coffins, gold-colored masks discovered in Luxor MPs suggest Facebook users pay monthly subscription to aid state surveillance Why does Egypt's largest Muslim beacon, Al-Azhar, refuse to declare IS 'apostate'?

Humor on the wall of Building 5. Eric Berger Last October, during a White House Frontiers Conference in Pittsburgh, President Obama sat down in a simulator of Boeing's Starliner spacecraft, which will begin transporting astronauts to the International Space Station within a couple of years. The commander-in-chief wanted to try his hand at a task astronauts would eventually have to perform. After taking the controls and cleanly docking to the station, Obama gleefully exulted, “Your ride is here, baby." Further ReadingBoeing releases snazzy new blue spacesuits for Starliner fliers So when I sat down in the same simulator on a recent Friday morning at the FIRST Robotics Competition in Houston, I felt a little pressure to match the president's success. Even though this simulator has been "dumbed" down for the general public from the real thing, it still wasn't trivial to guide the Starliner, nose first, into a docking port on the station's Node 2 module. Fortunately, I had an experienced hand in the copilot's seat in the person of Dan Nelson. He is Boeing's guidance, navigation, and control technical lead engineer and has worked extensively to develop the systems that allow Starliner to safely fly to the station. As we moved toward the international laboratory at a fraction of a meter per second, Nelson gave me advice on controlling the spacecraft during its approach. A little more thrust. Move up. That kind of thing. Enlarge / Eric Berger, left, and Dan Nelson, try not to crash into the International Space Station. Boeing After we nailed the docking—saving the station from billions of dollars in damage and myself from humiliation—Nelson still chided me a bit. "These kids," he said, looking around at the milling students participating in the robotics competition, "are pretty good at this without any help. Especially the ones who play Kerbal Space Program." Getting ready for flight In 2014 both Boeing and SpaceX won contracts from NASA to develop commercial crew spacecraft that would ferry astronauts to the ISS and end NASA's dependence on Russia for such transportation services. At the time, NASA had hoped those flights could begin by the end of this year, but now they will slip into 2018 or even 2019 due to technical troubles. Nevertheless, Boeing has made progress, both with the integration of the spacecraft (hundreds of components, made by a multitude of contractors, must be put together and tested extensively) and other aspects of its development, including limiting the impacts of orbital debris. The company also believes it has solved acoustic issues related to turbulence during its launch aboard an Atlas V rocket. Video courtesy of Boeing. Boeing is moving forward with other aspects of the launch not directly involving the spacecraft, too. Last August the company installed a 50-foot, 90,000-pound "crew access arm" at Space Launch Complex-41 in Florida, which astronauts will walk across to climb inside the Starliner for flight. Boeing has also installed, or soon will, training devices at Johnson Space Center for the astronauts. These include crew part-task trainers that provide a more detailed simulation of mission phases and flight conditions than the public simulator. The company is also finalizing a full-scale, high-fidelity simulator to train astronauts on all aspects of the flight, including emergency egress. Finding pizzazz The public display of the flight simulator comes as Boeing has made a concerted push to publicize the development of its Starliner spacecraft. This represents a new challenge for Boeing, a traditional aerospace contractor that in recent years has had to grapple with the rise of flashier new space companies, such as SpaceX. Whereas Elon Musk and SpaceX have proven masterful at garnering public attention and adoration for their efforts, Boeing has historically let NASA take credit for its work. But the commercial crew program is funded differently from NASA's traditional cost-plus contracts. NASA will pay less money for Boeing's Starliner and SpaceX's Dragon capabilities, but the companies will retain control of the spacecraft and will be able to use them for commercial opportunities that arise. Further ReadingQuietly, the new space race between SpaceX and Boeing burns hot So during the last year, Boeing has made efforts to add pizzazz to the Starliner. There was President Obama's use of the simulator last October, and the machine is visiting a handful of conferences, like the FIRST Robotics event in Houston. The company has also cultivated a relationship with Stephen Colbert, who helped roll out the company's new blue spacesuit. Boeing has had some success with its effort, but it has been difficult to match the attention SpaceX has received for its accomplishments of late—particularly launching and landing a reused rocket. But for both companies, the real publicity prize will come along with the first launch of US astronauts from US soil since the space shuttle's retirement in 2011. Not only will this be the first time a private company has sent humans into orbit, it will also be a mom-and-apple-pie moment for the country in a patriotic sense. For this, Boeing remains locked in a race with SpaceX to reach the launch pad first, and the race remains too close to call.

(Boeing) The second BTX prototype aircraft to be built by Boeing and Saab performed its maiden flight on 24 April. The flight out of Boeing's St Louis facility in Missouri lasted for approximately one hour, and was used to validate key aspects of the aircraft which is identical to the first prototype which flew in December 2016. According to Boeing, the aircraft 'met all expectations'. Developed for the US Air Force's (USAF) T-X training requirement, the BTX features a single General Electric Aviation GE 404 engine, a 'glass' cockpit, and open systems architecture. While officials have previously declined to provide details of the work split between Boeing and Saab, it has been noted that BTX features aspects of both the Boeing F/A-18E/F Super Hornet and the Saab Gripen combat aircraft in its design. Boeing-Saab is one of five teams potentially aiming to secure a potential USAF order for up to 350 new trainer aircraft to replace the service's ageing Northrop Grumman T-38 Talons. Lockheed Martin-Korean Aerospace Industries is entering with the T-50A (a derivative of the T-50 Golden Eagle), as is Leonardo with the T-100 (a T-X-specific variant of the M-346). Boeing confirmed that its bid had been submitted in March, While Leonardo, which recently had to replace its Raytheon prime for T-X with its own Leonardo DRS subsidiary, has said that it is to assemble its T-100 aircraft in Tuskegee, Alabama. A team comprising the Sierra Nevada Corporation and Turkish Aerospace Industries (TAI) is also reported to be developing a clean-sheet design (a Jane's request for confirmation was not answered), while US company Stavatti says it will offer its Javelin clean-sheet design. Northrop Grumman decided not to enter the Model 400 aircraft it developed for the competition for unspecified reasons, while Textron has discounted its Scorpion jet which was previously reported to be a possible contender.

Tim Hepher Boeing seems worried the A321neo’s success could prompt fleet decisions that weaken the smaller 737 MAX 8, its main cash cow. Photo: Andrey Rudakov/Bloomberg Paris: Boeing is nearing a decision to launch a larger version of its 737 workhorse jet within two months to counter strong sales of the Airbus A321neo, after a breakthrough on the design for one of its parts, industry sources said. The 737 MAX 10 would narrow the gap between the 178-220 seat 737-9, which first flew this month, and the 185-240 seat A321neo, which dominates the top end of a market for narrowbody jets worth $2 trillion over 20 years. Boeing has been studying how to solve a tricky problem with the design of the plane’s landing gear, without adding cost or delaying a 2020 target for first deliveries. The sources said a two-part technical solution is being tested and that Boeing is negotiating with airlines with the aim of launching the 737-10 at the Paris Airshow in June. Boeing is said to anticipate a total market of 1,000 of the planes. “Boeing is actively engaged in discussions with customers about the 737 MAX 10X,” a spokesman said. “No decision has been made on the plane and any discussion on timing of a possible launch would be speculative.” Reuters reported last year that the 737-10 marks a tactical response to the A321neo, while Boeing works on strategic plans for a 220-260-seat twin-aisle, mid-market jet. But it has produced a puzzle so tricky that Boeing has asked for help from its combat jet experts to design a space-saving gear for the 737-10. A solution is needed because the 737-10 will be longer than the 737-9 to make room for about 12 extra seats. The landing gear must become taller too or the tail could scrape the runway. Anxious to avoid costly changes to the rest of the plane and stay on schedule, Boeing aims to make the gear longer only when needed, but small enough to fit in the 737’s existing wheel bay. It has not made final decisions but is testing an advanced proposal to allow the 737 to effectively sit back on its heels as it leaves the runway. This is what aerospace engineers call a “semi-levered” design and is a nod to two bigger jets: the 777 and 787-10. In a further twist, the gear would lengthen telescopically for the 737-10 to charge down the runway. Afterwards, it would shrink again to retract into the same space. Competition impact Drawing-board decisions like these feed directly into the battle for jet sales. A longer gear allows pilots to use the same take-off angle rather than easing off to avoid striking the runway with the tail of the longer jet. Shallower take-offs need more runway, limiting the number of airports served and restricting sales. Airbus, which declined comment, is likely to try to persuade potential 737-10 buyers that it is little different from the slow-selling 737-9. Sources say it is meanwhile working on its own improvements to the A320 family, code-named A320neo-plus. Experts say more capacity could put costs per seat of the 737-10 in the same ballpark as the A321neo, leaving jet-makers to slug it out over range and performance. Boeing decided against using a bigger engine to boost those two features. It is gambling that some airlines will prefer extra seats and fly the 737-10 mainly on short routes. Although reports have focused on the clash between the A321neo and 737-9/10, industry sources say it’s not just the top end of the narrowbody market that drives the new design. Because most carriers stick to one jet family, they say Boeing seems worried the A321neo’s success could prompt fleet decisions that weaken the smaller 737 MAX 8, its main cash cow. “It’s a defensive move. Boeing wants to prevent the A321neo being a trojan horse in its own fleet,” one strategist said.

This is what aerospace engineers call a "semi-levered" design and is a nod to two bigger jets: the 777 and 787-10. In a further twist, the gear would lengthen telescopically for the 737-10 to charge down the runway. Afterwards, it would shrink again to retract into the same space. COMPETITION IMPACT Drawing-board decisions like these feed directly into the battle for jet sales. A longer gear allows pilots to use the same take-off angle rather than easing off to avoid striking the runway with the tail of the longer jet. Shallower take-offs need more runway, limiting the number of airports served and restricting sales. Airbus, which declined comment, is likely to try to persuade potential 737-10 buyers that it is little different from the slow-selling 737-9. Sources say it is meanwhile working on its own improvements to the A320 family codenamed A320neo-plus. Experts say more capacity could put costs per seat of the 737-10 in the same ballpark as the A321neo, leaving jetmakers to slug it out over range and performance. Boeing decided against using a bigger engine to boost those two features. It is gambling that some airlines will prefer extra seats and fly the 737-10 mainly on short routes. Although reports have focused on the clash between the A321neo and 737-9/10, industry sources say it's not just the top end of the narrowbody market that drives the new design. Because most carriers stick to one jet family, they say Boeing seems worried the A321neo's success could prompt fleet decisions that weaken the smaller 737 MAX 8, its main cash cow. "It's a defensive move. Boeing wants to prevent the A321neo being a Trojan Horse in its own fleet," one strategist said.

The 737 MAX 10 would narrow the gap between the 178-220 seat 737-9, which first flew this month, and the 185-240 seat A321neo, which dominates the top end of the market for narrowbody jets. Boeing has been studying how to solve a tricky problem with the design of the plane's landing gear, without adding cost or delaying a 2020 target for first deliveries. The sources said a two-part technical solution is being tested and that Boeing is negotiating with airlines with the aim of launching the 737-10 at the Paris Airshow in June. "Boeing is actively engaged in discussions with customers about the 737 MAX 10X," a spokesman said. "No decision has been made on the airplane and any discussion on timing of a possible launch would be speculative." Reuters reported last year that the 737-10 marks a quick tactical response to the A321neo, while Boeing works on pivotal plans for a 220-260-seat twin-aisle, mid-market jet. But it has produced a puzzle so tricky that Boeing has asked for help from its combat jet experts to design a space-saving gear for the 737-10. A solution is needed because the 737-10 will be longer than the 737-9 to make room for about 12 extra seats. The landing gear must become taller too or the tail could scrape the runway. Anxious to avoid costly changes to the rest of the plane and stay on schedule, Boeing aims to make the gear longer only when needed, but small enough to fit in the 737's existing wheel bay.

In a further twist, the gear would lengthen telescopically for the 737-10 to charge down the runway. Afterwards, it would shrink again to retract into the same space.

Boeing is said to anticipate a total market of 1,000 of the planes. "Boeing is actively engaged in discussions with customers about the 737 MAX 10X," a spokesman said. "No decision has been made on the airplane and any discussion on timing of a possible launch would be speculative." Boeing shares were up slightly in early trading. Reuters reported last year that the 737-10 marks a tactical response to the A321neo, while Boeing works on strategic plans for a 220-260-seat twin-aisle, mid-market jet. But it has produced a puzzle so tricky that Boeing has asked for help from its combat jet experts to design a space-saving gear for the 737-10. A solution is needed because the 737-10 will be longer than the 737-9 to make room for about 12 extra seats. The landing gear must become taller too or the tail could scrape the runway. Anxious to avoid costly changes to the rest of the plane and stay on schedule, Boeing aims to make the gear longer only when needed, but small enough to fit in the 737's existing wheel bay. It has not made final decisions but is testing an advanced proposal to allow the 737 to effectively sit back on its heels as it leaves the runway. This is what aerospace engineers call a "semi-levered" design and is a nod to two bigger jets: the 777 and 787-10. In a further twist, the gear would lengthen telescopically for the 737-10 to charge down the runway. Afterwards, it would shrink again to retract into the same space. COMPETITION IMPACT Drawing-board decisions like these feed directly into the battle for jet sales. A longer gear allows pilots to use the same take-off angle rather than easing off to avoid striking the runway with the tail of the longer jet. Shallower take-offs need more runway, limiting the number of airports served and restricting sales. Airbus, which declined comment, will try to persuade potential 737-10 buyers that it is little different from the slow-selling 737-9. It is meanwhile said to be working on its own improvements to the A320 family codenamed A320neo-plus. Market sources say Boeing is offering 5 percent lower costs per seat than the A321neo for the 737-10. Some experts are more cautious on operating costs, leaving jetmakers to slug it out over two other important drivers: range and performance. Boeing decided against using a bigger engine to boost those features and is gambling that some airlines will prefer extra seats and fly the 737-10 mainly on short routes. Although reports have focused on the clash between the A321neo and 737-9/10, industry sources say it's not just the top end of the narrowbody market that drives the new design. Because most carriers stick to one jet family, they say Boeing seems worried the A321neo's success could prompt fleet decisions that weaken the smaller 737 MAX 8. The 737-10 would thus be an extra rampart to defend Boeing's biggest cash cow. "It's a defensive move. Boeing wants to prevent the A321neo being a Trojan Horse in its own fleet," one strategist said.

Photo: Reuters mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 5:15 PM, April 25, 2017 Updated: 7:30 AM, April 26, 2017 PARIS - Boeing <BA.N> is nearing a decision to launch a larger version of its 737 workhorse jet within two months to counter strong sales of the Airbus <AIR.PA> A321neo, after a breakthrough on the design for one of its parts, industry sources said. The 737 MAX 10 would narrow the gap between the 178-220 seat 737-9, which first flew this month, and the 185-240 seat A321neo, which dominates the top end of a market for narrowbody jets worth $2 trillion over 20 years.

The Comac C919 jet is expected to stage its maiden flight in the coming weeks, and foreign media and potential buyers will be invited in force – illustrating how Beijing is adjusting to competition for a slice of global jet sales worth $2 trillion over the next 20 years. But after three years of delays and almost a decade in development, China’s answer to the Boeing 737 and its state-owned designers face a daunting phase: selling the jet abroad in a market dominated by Boeing and Airbus. “They will be trying to compete on price against people who are building aircraft at a much faster pace and with more experience, so there’s a risk of getting bled dry,” said Richard Aboulafia, aerospace analyst at Virginia-based Teal Group. People take pictures and videos as the first C919 passenger jet made by the Commercial Aircraft Corp of China (Comac) is pulled out from behind a curtain during a news conference at the company’s factory in Shanghai, November 2, 2015. Image: Reuters/China Daily Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (Comac) has some cards to play: its plane has Western engines and avionics coupled with a new design; it’s rolling out a pilot training program, expanding international staff and has strong, behind-the-scenes backing from Beijing, industry executives say. And though still unproven, Comac could be the single biggest threat over the coming decades to the dominance of Boeing and Airbus, both in China’s own huge aviation market and, longer-term, overseas. The C919 is the first step to this. Beijing’s backing for the single-aisle plane gives Comac a springboard in the world’s fastest-growing domestic market, even though the company acknowledges much bigger hurdles abroad. “You can’t compare us to Boeing or Airbus, they’re in a different strategic stage… We took half a century to solve the first strategic issue (of plane development), it will also take many years to solve the second (market) problem,” said Jeff Cheng, a spokesman for Comac. “After the first flight, we have to focus and research on how to improve the plane’s and Comac’s market competitiveness.” Eric Chen, president of Airbus Commercial Aircraft China, welcomed the competition from Comac, and a China-based spokesman for Boeing congratulated the company on developing the C919. Image: Comac Global Support Network The C919 has chalked up 570 firm orders and commitments from 23 customers, mainly Chinese state-backed airlines and leasing companies, but says it is not able to give a breakdown. In comparison, the latest version of the Boeing 737 had more than 3,000 firm orders before it flew last January. Those types of numbers from the two big global planemakers come after decades of trimming costs and honing marketing pitches. The two have global support networks able to respond whenever a jet breaks down just about anywhere, and the number of jets flying makes it easier for airlines to raise loans to buy them. While Chinese financiers have muscled into the global aviation arena, Comac has a relatively low-key presence at international air shows and has said the C919 will initially be aimed at the domestic market. But there are signs it’s adopting a more outward-facing approach. While operating manuals for Comac’s smaller ARJ21 regional jet, which took its first flight in 2007, were written in Mandarin, the C919’s will be in English to support sales. Image: Comac Comac’s sales and support networks – it has at least 50 people in its sales and marketing departments, says Cheng – are, however, a fraction of those at Boeing and Airbus. Still, Comac’s home advantage is significant as Chinese airlines are likely to drive airplane demand over the next two decades, buying nearly 7,000 planes – mostly from Boeing and Airbus. “Their sales person is the government,” said a Chinese airline executive, who didn’t want to be named for risk of damaging business relationships. “As long as the government tells the state airlines to purchase planes, that will happen.” Airline executives say the first flight is when Comac can realistically start discussing deposits and firming up customers, even if the plane still faces years of testing. “We haven’t placed a deposit; at the moment it’s intentions,” said Che Shanglun, chairman of Xiamen Airlines, a subsidiary of China Southern Airlines, which has committed to buying up to 50 of the 158-seat C919s. “We signed for 50, but we actually want to buy 30. We have to see if they’re able to produce it… They (Comac) are very enthusiastic, they meet us every month and send us updates.” Image: Comac How Safe is it? Executives at two Chinese airlines which have not placed orders for the aircraft said they wanted to see the C919’s safety record, as well as the creation of a global support team. The safety certification of the new plane – which state media says will have a catalog price tag of around $50 million, less than half that of a Boeing 737 or Airbus A320 – could be among the biggest issues for the C919 internationally. Having a plane certified to fly commercially is tough enough even for Western jetmakers as aircraft become more complex and supply chains expand. There is still uncertainty over approvals needed for the C919 to secure a foothold beyond China, with the United States and European Union having the most influence. Although the EU has agreed to recognize some of the checks carried out by China, it is expected to insist on some of its own tests before issuing a safety certificate and is trying to understand where discrepancies between the two systems lie.

Image: Reuters/Bobby Yip “We are just at the start of the process,” said Patrick Ky, executive director of the European Aviation Safety Agency. The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Without Western approvals, China would only be able to sell to countries that accept its certification standards. Zimbabwe, Bolivia and Tajikistan have previously bought Chinese planes. Without Western certification, “sales of the aircraft in developed economies and many developing economies will be difficult to impossible,” said Bradley Perrett, a veteran China watcher at Aviation Week. The C919’s only real foreign buyer so far is leasing firm GE Capital Aviation Services, whose parent General Electric co-built the plane’s engine with France’s Safran. “Only once our plane enters the market and is tested can we see what gaps it has,” Cheng said.

(AP Photo/Andrew Harnik) A transcript of an Oval Office interview Friday with President Donald Trump by AP White House Correspondent Julie Pace. Where the audio recording of the interview is unclear, ellipses or a notation that the recording was unintelligible are used. AP: I do want to talk to you about the 100 days. TRUMP: Good. AP: I want to ask a few questions on some topics that are happening toward the end of the interview. TRUMP: Did you see Aya (Hijazi, an Egyptian-American charity worker who had been detained in the country for nearly three years) … AP: Can you tell me a little bit about how that came about? TRUMP: No, just — you know, I asked the government to let her out. … TRUMP: You know Obama worked on it for three years, got zippo, zero. AP: How did you hear about this story? TRUMP: Many people, human rights people, are talking about it. It’s an incredible thing, especially when you meet her. You realize — I mean, she was in a rough place. AP: Did you have to strike a deal with (Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah) el-Sissi over this? TRUMP: No. No deal. He was here. He — I said, “I really would appreciate it if you would look into this and let her out.” And as you know, she went through a trial. And anyway, she was let go. And not only she, it was a total of eight people. … ___ TRUMP: Yeah, it’s funny: One of the best chemistries I had was with (German Chancellor Angela) Merkel. (Crosstalk) AP: Really? TRUMP: Chancellor Merkel. TRUMP: And I guess somebody shouted out, “Shake her hand, shake her hand,” you know. But I never heard it. But I had already shaken her hand four times. You know, because we were together for a long time. AP: Did you expect you would have good chemistry with her? TRUMP: No. Because, um, I’m at odds on, you know, the NATO payments and I’m at odds on immigration. We had unbelievable chemistry. And people have given me credit for having great chemistry with all of the leaders, including el-Sissi. … TRUMP: So it was a great thing to see that happen. ___ AP: Do you feel like you have changed the office of the presidency, how the presidency can be used to effect change? TRUMP: I think the 100 days is, you know, it’s an artificial barrier. It’s not very meaningful. I think I’ve established amazing relationships that will be used the four or eight years, whatever period of time I’m here. I think for that I would be getting very high marks because I’ve established great relationships with countries, as President el-Sissi has shown and others have shown. Well, if you look at the president of China, people said they’ve never seen anything like what’s going on right now. I really liked him a lot. I think he liked me. We have a great chemistry together. … TRUMP: I’ve developed great relationships with all of these leaders. Nobody’s written that. In fact, they said, “Oh, well, he’s not treating them nicely,” because on NATO, I want them to pay up. But I still get along with them great, and they will pay up. In fact, with the Italian prime minister yesterday, you saw, we were joking, “Come on, you have to pay up, you have to pay up.” He’ll pay. AP: Did he say that? In your meeting? Your private meeting? TRUMP: He’s going to end up paying. But you know, nobody ever asked the question. Nobody asked. Nobody ever asked him to pay up. So it’s a different kind of a presidency. AP: Do you feel like that’s one thing that you’ve changed, that you maybe are actually asking the direct questions about some of these things? TRUMP: Yeah. Let me give me an example. A little before I took office there was a terrible article about the F-35 fighter jet. It was hundreds of billions of dollars over budget. It was seven years behind schedule. It was a disaster. So I called in Lockheed and I said, “I’m sorry, we’re going to have to bid this out to another company, namely Boeing,” or whoever else. But Boeing. And I called in Boeing and I started getting competing offers back and forth. … TRUMP: I saved $725 million on the 90 planes. Just 90. Now there are 3,000 planes that are going to be ordered. On 90 planes I saved $725 million. It’s actually a little bit more than that, but it’s $725 million. Gen. Mattis, who had to sign the deal when it came to his office, said, “I’ve never seen anything like this in my life.” We went from a company that wanted more money for the planes to a company that cut. And the reason they cut — same planes, same everything — was because of me. I mean, because that’s what I do. TRUMP: Now if you multiply that times 3,000 planes, you know this is on 90 planes. In fact, when the Prime Minister (Shinzo) Abe of Japan came in because they bought a certain number of those … The first thing he said to me, because it was right at the time I did it, he said, “Could I thank you?” I said, “What?” He said, “You saved us $100 million.” Because they got a $100 million savings on the 10 or 12 planes that they (bought). Nobody wrote that story. Now you know that’s a saving of billions and billions of dollars, many billions of dollars over the course of — it’s between 2,500 and 3,000 planes will be the final order. But this was only 90 of those 2,500 planes. AP: And you expect those savings to carry out across that full order? TRUMP: More. I’m gonna get more than that. This was a thing that was out of control and now it’s great. And the woman that runs Lockheed, Marillyn (Hewson), she was great. But all of a sudden it was a different kind of a thing. You know? ___ AP: Do you feel like you’ve been able to apply that kind of a relationship to your dealings with Congress as well? TRUMP: I have great relationships with Congress. I think we’re doing very well and I think we have a great foundation for future things. We’re going to be applying, I shouldn’t tell you this, but we’re going to be announcing, probably on Wednesday, tax reform. And it’s — we’ve worked on it long and hard. And you’ve got to understand, I’ve only been here now 93 days, 92 days. President Obama took 17 months to do Obamacare. I’ve been here 92 days but I’ve only been working on the health care, you know I had to get like a little bit of grounding right? Health care started after 30 day(s), so I’ve been working on health care for 60 days. …You know, we’re very close. And it’s a great plan, you know, we have to get it approved. AP: Is it this deal that’s between the Tuesday Group and the Freedom Caucus, is that the deal you’re looking at? TRUMP: So the Republican Party has various groups, all great people. They’re great people. But some are moderate, some are very conservative. The Democrats don’t seem to have that nearly as much. You know the Democrats have, they don’t have that. The Republicans do have that. And I think it’s fine. But you know there’s a pretty vast area in there. And I have a great relationship with all of them. Now, we have government not closing. I think we’ll be in great shape on that. It’s going very well. Obviously, that takes precedent. AP: That takes precedent over health care? For next week? TRUMP: Yeah, sure. Next week. Because the hundred days is just an artificial barrier. The press keeps talking about the hundred days. But we’ve done a lot. You have a list of things. I don’t have to read it. ___ AP: You did put out though, as a candidate, you put out a 100-day plan. Do you feel like you should be held accountable to that plan? TRUMP: Somebody, yeah, somebody put out the concept of a hundred-day plan. But yeah. Well, I’m mostly there on most items. Go over the items, and I’ll talk to you … (Crosstalk.) TRUMP: But things change. There has to be flexibility. Let me give you an example. President Xi, we have a, like, a really great relationship. For me to call him a currency manipulator and then say, “By the way, I’d like you to solve the North Korean problem,” doesn’t work. So you have to have a certain flexibility, Number One. Number Two, from the time I took office till now, you know, it’s a very exact thing. It’s not like generalities. Do you want a Coke or anything? AP: I’m OK, thank you. No. … TRUMP: But President Xi, from the time I took office, he has not, they have not been currency manipulators. Because there’s a certain respect because he knew I would do something or whatever. But more importantly than him not being a currency manipulator the bigger picture, bigger than even currency manipulation, if he’s helping us with North Korea, with nuclear and all of the things that go along with it, who would call, what am I going to do, say, “By the way, would you help us with North Korea? And also, you’re a currency manipulator.” It doesn’t work that way. AP: Right. TRUMP: And the media, some of them get it, in all fairness. But you know some of them either don’t get it, in which case they’re very stupid people, or they just don’t want to say it. You know because of a couple of them said, “He didn’t call them a currency manipulator.” Well, for two reasons. Number One, he’s not, since my time. You know, very specific formula. You would think it’s like generalities, it’s not. They have — they’ve actually — their currency’s gone up. So it’s a very, very specific formula. And I said, “How badly have they been,” … they said, “Since you got to office they have not manipulated their currency.” That’s Number One, but much more important, they are working with us on North Korea. Now maybe that’ll work out or maybe it won’t. Can you imagine? … AP: So in terms of the 100-day plan that you did put out during the campaign, do you feel, though, that people should hold you accountable to this in terms of judging success? TRUMP: No, because much of the foundation’s been laid. Things came up. I’ll give you an example. I didn’t put Supreme Court judge on the 100 (day) plan, and I got a Supreme Court judge. AP: I think it’s on there. TRUMP: I don’t know. … AP: “Begin the process of selecting.” You actually exceeded on this one. This says, “Begin the process of selecting a replacement.” TRUMP: That’s the biggest thing I’ve done. AP: Do you consider that your biggest success? TRUMP: Well, I — first of all I think he’s a great man. I think he will be a great, great justice of the Supreme Court. I have always heard that the selection and the affirmation of a Supreme Court judge is the biggest thing a president can do. Don’t forget, he could be there for 40 years. … He’s a young man. I’ve always heard that that’s the biggest thing. Now, I would say that defense is the biggest thing. You know, to be honest, there are a number of things. But I’ve always heard that the highest calling is the nomination of a Supreme Court justice. I’ve done one in my first 70 days. TRUMP: Our military is so proud. They were not proud at all. They had their heads down. Now they have their heads up. … TRUMP: I’m rebuilding the military. We have great people. We have great things in place. We have tremendous borders. I mention the F-35 because if I can save $725 million — look at that, that’s a massive amount of money. And I’ll save more as we make more planes. If I can save that on a small number of planes — Gen. (Jim) Mattis (the defense secretary) said, “I’ve never seen anything like this,” because he had to sign the ultimate (unintelligible) … He had to sign the ultimate, you know. He said, “I’ve never seen anything like this before, as long as I’ve been in the military.” You know, that kind of cutting. AP: Right. TRUMP: Now, if I can do that (unintelligible) … As an example, the aircraft carriers, billions of dollars, the Gerald Ford, billions and billions over budget. That won’t happen. AP: Is that something you’re going to take on? TRUMP: (unintelligible) But as we order the other ones, because they want to order 12, the other ones are going to come in much less expensive. … ___ AP: Can I ask you, over your first 100 days — you’re not quite there yet — how do you feel like the office has changed you? TRUMP: Well the one thing I would say — and I say this to people — I never realized how big it was. Everything’s so (unintelligible) like, you know the orders are so massive. I was talking to — AP: You mean the responsibility of it, or do you mean — TRUMP: Number One, there’s great responsibility. When it came time to, as an example, send out the 59 missiles, the Tomahawks in Syria. I’m saying to myself, “You know, this is more than just like, 79 (sic) missiles. This is death that’s involved,” because people could have been killed. This is risk that’s involved, because if the missile goes off and goes in a city or goes in a civilian area — you know, the boats were hundreds of miles away — and if this missile goes off and lands in the middle of a town or a hamlet …. every decision is much harder than you’d normally make. (unintelligible) … This is involving death and life and so many things. … So it’s far more responsibility. (unintelligible) ….The financial cost of everything is so massive, every agency. This is thousands of times bigger, the United States, than the biggest company in the world. The second-largest company in the world is the Defense Department. The third-largest company in the world is Social Security. The fourth-largest — you know, you go down the list. AP: Right. TRUMP. It’s massive. And every agency is, like, bigger than any company. So you know, I really just see the bigness of it all, but also the responsibility. And the human responsibility. You know, the human life that’s involved in some of the decisions. ___ AP: You’ve talked a little bit about the way that you’ve brought some business skills into the office. Is there anything from your business background that just doesn’t translate into the presidency, that just simply is not applicable to this job? TRUMP: Well in business, you don’t necessarily need heart, whereas here, almost everything affects people. So if you’re talking about health care — you have health care in business but you’re trying to just negotiate a good price on health care, et cetera, et cetera. You’re providing health. This is (unintelligible). Here, everything, pretty much everything you do in government, involves heart, whereas in business, most things don’t involve heart. AP: What’s that switch been like for you? TRUMP: In fact, in business you’re actually better off without it. AP: What’s making that switch been like for you? TRUMP: You have to love people. And if you love people, such a big responsibility. (unintelligible) You can take any single thing, including even taxes. I mean we’re going to be doing major tax reform. Here’s part of your story, it’s going to be a big (unintelligible). Everybody’s saying, “Oh, he’s delaying.” I’m not delaying anything. I’ll tell you the other thing is (unintelligible). I used to get great press. I get the worst press. I get such dishonest reporting with the media. That’s another thing that really has — I’ve never had anything like it before. It happened during the primaries, and I said, you know, when I won, I said, “Well the one thing good is now I’ll get good press.” And it got worse. (unintelligible) So that was one thing that a little bit of a surprise to me. I thought the press would become better, and it actually, in my opinion, got more nasty. ___ AP: But in terms of tax reform, how are you going to roll that out next week? TRUMP: Well I’m going to roll (out) probably on Wednesday, around Wednesday of next week, we’re putting out a massive tax reform — business and for people — we want to do both. We’ve been working on it (unintelligible). Secretary Mnuchin is a very talented person, very smart. Very successful (unintelligible). … We’re going to be putting that out on Wednesday or shortly thereafter. Let me leave a little room just in case (unintelligible). … And that’s a big story, because a lot of people think I’m going to put it out much later. AP: Do you have any details on that in terms of rates? TRUMP: Only in terms that it will be a massive tax cut. It will be bigger, I believe, than any tax cut ever. Maybe the biggest tax cut we’ve ever had. … ___ AP: Obviously, that’s going to come in a week where you’re going to be running up against the deadline for keeping the government open. If you get a bill on your desk that does not include funding for the wall, will you sign it? TRUMP: I don’t know yet. People want the border wall. My base definitely wants the border wall, my base really wants it — you’ve been to many of the rallies. OK, the thing they want more than anything is the wall. My base, which is a big base; I think my base is 45 percent. You know, it’s funny. The Democrats, they have a big advantage in the electoral college. Big, big, big advantage. I’ve always said the popular vote would be a lot easier than the electoral college. The electoral college — but it’s a whole different campaign (unintelligible). The electoral college is very difficult for a Republican to win, and I will tell you, the people want to see it. They want to see the wall, they want to see security. Now, it just came out that they’re 73 percent down. … That’s a tremendous achievement. … Look at this, in 100 days, that down to the lowest in 17 years and it’s going lower. Now, people aren’t coming because they know they’re not going to get through, and there isn’t crime. You know the migration up to the border is horrible for women, you know that? (Unintelligible.) Now, much of that’s stopped because they can’t get through. AP: It sounds like maybe you’re beginning to send a message that if you do get a spending bill that doesn’t have border funding in there, you would sign it. TRUMP: Well, first of all, the wall will cost much less than the numbers I’m seeing. I’m seeing numbers, I mean, this wall is not going to be that expensive. AP: What do you think the estimate on it would be? TRUMP: Oh I’m seeing numbers — $24 billion, I think I’ll do it for $10 billion or less. That’s not a lot of money relative to what we’re talking about. If we stop 1 percent of the drugs from coming in — and we’ll stop all of it. But if we stop 1 percent of the drugs because we have the wall — they’re coming around in certain areas, but if you have a wall, they can’t do it because it’s a real wall. That’s a tremendously good investment, 1 percent. The drugs pouring through on the southern border are unbelievable. We’re becoming a drug culture, there’s so much. And most of it’s coming from the southern border. The wall will stop the drugs. AP: But, just trying to nail you down on it one more time, will you sign a spending bill if it doesn’t have — TRUMP: I don’t want to comment. I just don’t know yet. I mean, I have to see what’s going on. I really do. But the wall’s a very important thing to — not only my base, but to the people. And even if it wasn’t, I mean I’ll do things that aren’t necessarily popular. … The wall is very important to stopping drugs. AP: If you don’t have a funding stream, your message to your base is what? TRUMP: My base understands the wall is going to get built, whether I have it funded here or if I get it funded shortly thereafter, that wall’s getting built, OK? One hundred percent. One hundred percent it’s getting built. And it’s also getting built for much less money — I hope you get this — than these people are estimating. The opponents are talking $25 billion for the wall. It’s not going to cost anywhere near that. AP: You think $10 billion or less. TRUMP: I think $10 billion or less. And if I do a super-duper, higher, better, better security, everything else, maybe it goes a little bit more. But it’s not going to be anywhere near (those) kind of numbers. And they’re using those numbers; they’re using the high numbers to make it sound impalatable (sic). And the fact it’s going to cost much less money, just like the airplane I told you about, which I hope you can write about. ___ (Off-the-record discussion.) ___ TRUMP: They had a quote from me that NATO’s obsolete. But they didn’t say why it was obsolete. I was on Wolf Blitzer, very fair interview, the first time I was ever asked about NATO, because I wasn’t in government. People don’t go around asking about NATO if I’m building a building in Manhattan, right? So they asked me, Wolf … asked me about NATO, and I said two things. NATO’s obsolete — not knowing much about NATO, now I know a lot about NATO — NATO is obsolete, and I said, “And the reason it’s obsolete is because of the fact they don’t focus on terrorism.” You know, back when they did NATO there was no such thing as terrorism. AP: What specifically has NATO changed? TRUMP: (Cites Wall Street Journal article) … I did an interview with Wolf Blitzer, and I said NATO was obsolete — I said two things — obsolete, and the country’s aren’t paying. I was right about both. I took such heat for about three days on both, because nobody ever criticized NATO. I took heat like you wouldn’t believe. And then some expert on NATO said, “You know, Trump is right.” But I said it was obsolete because they weren’t focused on terror. … It’s not fair that we’re paying close to 4 percent and other countries that are more directly affected are paying 1 percent when they’re supposed to be paying 2 percent. And I’m very strong on it and I’m going to be very strong on it when I go there in a month.” __ AP: This morning you tweeted that after the possible terrorist attack in Paris, that it will have a big effect on the upcoming French election. What did you mean by that? TRUMP: Well, I think it will have a big effect on who people are going to vote for in the election. AP: Do you think it’s going to help Marine Le Pen? TRUMP: I think so. AP: Do you believe that she should be the president? TRUMP: No, I have no comment on that, but I think that it’ll probably help her because she is the strongest on borders and she is the strongest on what’s been going on in France. AP: Do you worry at all that by saying that, that a terrorist attack would have an impact on a democratic election, that it would actually embolden terrorists to try to —. TRUMP: No. Look, everybody is making predictions who is going to win. I am no different than you, you could say the same thing. … AP: I just wonder if you are encouraging, you are the president of the United States, so to say that you worry that it encourages terrorists … TRUMP: No, I am no different than — no, I think it discourages terrorists, I think it discourages. I think what we’ve done on the border discourages it. I think that my stance on having people come in to this country that we have no idea who they are and in certain cases you will have radical Islamic terrorism. I’m not going to have it in this country. I’m not going to let what happened to France and other places happen here. And it’s already largely, you know — we have tens — we have hundreds of thousands of people that have been allowed into our country that should not be here. They shouldn’t be here. We have people allowed into our country with no documentation whatsoever. They have no documentation and they were allowed under the previous administrations, they were allowed into our country. It’s a big mistake. AP: Just so that I am clear. You are not endorsing her for the office, but you are — TRUMP: I am not endorsing her and I didn’t mention her name. AP: Right, I just wanted to make sure I have that clear. TRUMP: I believe whoever is the toughest on radical Islamic terrorism and whoever is the toughest at the borders will do well at the election. I am not saying that person is going to win, she is not even favored to win, you know. Right now, she is in second place. ___ AP: I have a question on the markets, actually. One thing that I think has been different about this White House is that you do point to the markets as a sign of progress. Do you worry, though — I mean, the markets go up and down. TRUMP: You live by the sword, you die by the sword, to a certain extent. But we create a lot of jobs, 500,000 jobs as of two months ago, and plenty created since. Five hundred thousand. … As an example, Ford, General Motors. I’ve had cases where the gentleman from China, Ma, Jack Ma (chairman of Alibaba Group), he comes up, he says, “Only because of you am I making this massive investment.” Intel, only because of you. … The press never writes that. ___ AP: What about NAFTA? What’s the plan on NAFTA? TRUMP: What would you like to know? AP: I would like to know what your plan is in terms of renegotiating. TRUMP: I am very upset with NAFTA. I think NAFTA has been a catastrophic trade deal for the United States, trading agreement for the United States. It hurts us with Canada, and it hurts us with Mexico. Most people don’t even think of NAFTA in terms of Canada. You saw what happened yesterday in my statements, because if you look at the dairy farmers in Wisconsin and upstate New York, they are getting killed by NAFTA. AP: Is your plan still, though, to renegotiate the whole deal? TRUMP: I am going to either renegotiate it or I am going to terminate it. AP: Termination is still on the table. TRUMP: Absolutely. If they don’t treat fairly, I am terminating NAFTA. AP: What’s a timeline for that decision? TRUMP: It’s a six-month termination clause, I have the right to do it, it’s a six-month clause. ___ AP: If I could fit a couple of more topics. Jeff Sessions, your attorney general, is taking a tougher line suddenly on Julian Assange, saying that arresting him is a priority. You were supportive of what WikiLeaks was doing during the campaign with the release of the Clinton emails. Do you think that arresting Assange is a priority for the United States? TRUMP: When Wikileaks came out … never heard of Wikileaks, never heard of it. When Wikileaks came out, all I was just saying is, “Well, look at all this information here, this is pretty good stuff.” You know, they tried to hack the Republican, the RNC, but we had good defenses. They didn’t have defenses, which is pretty bad management. But we had good defenses, they tried to hack both of them. They weren’t able to get through to Republicans. No, I found it very interesting when I read this stuff and I said, “Wow.” It was just a figure of speech. I said, “Well, look at this. It’s good reading.” AP: But that didn’t mean that you supported what Assange is doing? TRUMP: No, I don’t support or unsupport. It was just information. They shouldn’t have allowed it to get out. If they had the proper defensive devices on their internet, you know, equipment, they wouldn’t even allow the FBI. How about this — they get hacked, and the FBI goes to see them, and they won’t let the FBI see their server. But do you understand, nobody ever writes it. Why wouldn’t (former Hillary Clinton campaign chairman John) Podesta and Hillary Clinton allow the FBI to see the server? They brought in another company that I hear is Ukrainian-based. AP: CrowdStrike? TRUMP: That’s what I heard. I heard it’s owned by a very rich Ukrainian, that’s what I heard. But they brought in another company to investigate the server. Why didn’t they allow the FBI in to investigate the server? I mean, there is so many things that nobody writes about. It’s incredible. AP: Can I just ask you, though — do you believe it is a priority for the United States, or it should be a priority, to arrest Julian Assange? TRUMP: I am not involved in that decision, but if Jeff Sessions wants to do it, it’s OK with me. I didn’t know about that decision, but if they want to do it, it’s OK with me. ___ AP: On Iran, which is another thing you talked a lot on the campaign — TRUMP: And the other thing that we should go after is the leakers. … AP: On Iran, you also talked about it quite a bit on the campaign trail. And you said in the press conference yesterday that you think that Iran is violating the spirit of the agreement. When you say that, do you mean in terms of the actual nuclear accord, or do you mean what they are doing in the region? TRUMP: In terms of what they are doing all over the Middle East and beyond. AP: So you believe that they are complying with the agreement? TRUMP: No, I don’t say that. I say that I believe they have broken the spirit of the agreement. There is a spirit to agreements, and they have broken it. AP: In terms of what they are doing elsewhere in the Middle East? TRUMP: In terms of what they are doing of all over. AP: When you talk to European leaders, when you talk to Merkel, for example, or Teresa May, what do they say about the nuclear deal? Do they want you to stay in that deal? TRUMP: I don’t talk to them about it. AP: You don’t talk to them about the Iran deal? TRUMP: I mention it, but it’s very personal when I talk to them, you know, it’s confidential. No, they have their own opinions. I don’t say that they are different than my opinions, but I’d rather have you ask them that question. AP: At this point, do you believe that you will stay in the nuclear deal? TRUMP: It’s possible that we won’t. ___ AP: Dreamers, you’ve talked about them, you’ve talked about heart earlier. This is one area where you have talked — TRUMP: No, we aren’t looking to do anything right now. Look, the dreamers … this is an interesting case, they left and they came back and he’s got some problems, it’s a little different than the dreamer case, right? But we are putting MS-13 in jail and getting them the hell out of our country. They’ve taken over towns and cities and we are being really brutal with MS-13, and that’s what we should be. They are a bad group, and somebody said they are as bad as al-Qaida, which is a hell of a reference. So we are moving criminals out of our country and we are getting them out in record numbers and those are the people we are after. We are not after the dreamers, we are after the criminals. AP: And that’s going to be the policy of your administration to allow the dreamers to stay? TRUMP: Yes. Yes. That’s our policy. I am not saying … long-term, we are going to have to fix the problem, the whole immigration problem. But I will tell you: Right now we have a great gentleman, one of my real stars is Gen. (John) Kelly, now (Homeland Security) Secretary Kelly. We are down 73 percent at the border, we are cleaning out cities and towns of hard-line criminals, some of the worst people on earth, people that rape and kill women, people that are killing people just for the sake of having fun. They are being thrown in jails and they are being … all over the country and nobody’s ever done it like us, so we are being unbelievably thorough with that. We are out in Long Island cleaning out the MS-13 scum, they are all scum, that’s probably the worst gang anywhere on Earth. … AP: A lot of the dreamers have been hoping to hear something from you. I don’t want to give them the wrong message with this. TRUMP: Here is what they can hear: The dreamers should rest easy. OK? I’ll give you that. The dreamers should rest easy. … ___ (An aide talks about the president’s address to Congress.) TRUMP: A lot of the people have said that, some people said it was the single best speech ever made in that chamber. AP: You seem like you enjoyed it. TRUMP: I did. I did. I believed in it and I enjoyed it. It was a great feeling to introduce the wife of a great young soldier who died getting us very valuable information. Have you seen the tremendous success? … That’s another thing that nobody talks about. Have you seen the tremendous success we’ve had in the Middle East with the ISIS (an abbreviation for the Islamic State group)? When (current Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al) Abadi left from Iraq, he said Trump has more success in eight weeks than Obama had in eight years. … We have had tremendous success, but we don’t talk about it. We don’t talk about it. AP: Do you mean you don’t talk about it personally because you don’t want to talk about it? TRUMP: I don’t talk about it. No. And the generals don’t talk about it. ___ AP: You had put a request into the Pentagon to put forward an ISIS plan within 30 days. I know they have sent that over. Have you accepted a plan? Are you moving forward on a strategy? TRUMP: We have a very strong plan, but we cannot talk about it, Julie. AP: So you have decided on a plan? TRUMP: Remember how many times have you been to the speech where I talked about Mosul. AP: Right. TRUMP. Right. Mosul. Four months we are going in, three months. We are still fighting Mosul. You know why? Because they were prepared. If we would have gone in and just done it, it would have been over three months ago. AP: Can you say generally what the strategy is? Should people — TRUMP: Generally is we have got to get rid of ISIS. We have no choice. And other terrorist organizations. AP: Should Americans who are serving in the military expect that you are going to increase troop numbers in the Middle East to fight ISIS? TRUMP: No, not much. AP: In terms of the strategy, though, that you have accepted, it sounds like, from the generals — TRUMP: Well, they’ve also accepted my strategy. AP: Does that involve more troops on the ground, it sounds like? TRUMP: Not many. AP: So a small increase? TRUMP: It could be an increase, then an increase. But not many more. I want to do the job, but not many more. … This is an important story. I’ve done a lot. I’ve done more than any other president in the first 100 days and I think the first 100 days is an artificial barrier. And I’m scheduled … the foundations have been set to do some great things. With foreign countries. Look at, look at President Xi. I mean … AP: What do you think it was about your chemistry? TRUMP: We had good chemistry. Now I don’t know that I think that’s going to produce results but you’ve got a good chance. AP: Uh-huh. TRUMP: Look, he turned down many coal ships. These massive coal ships are coming where they get a lot of their income. They’re coming into China and they’re being turned away. That’s never happened before. The fuel, the oil, so many different things. You saw the editorial they had in their paper saying they cannot be allowed to have nuclear, you know, et cetera. People have said they’ve never seen this ever before in China. We have the same relationship with others. There’s a great foundation that’s built. Great foundation. And I think it’s going to produce tremendous results for our country. ___ AP: One more 100 days question. TRUMP: That’s fine. AP: … is do you think you have the right team in place for your next 100 days? TRUMP: Yes. I think my team has been, well, I have different teams. I think my military team has been treated with great respect. As they should be. I think my other team hasn’t been treated with the respect that they should get. We have some very talented people, and very diverse people. AP: Do you mean your White House team when you say that? TRUMP: Yeah, my White House team. I think Reince (Priebus) has been doing an excellent job. I think that, you know, this is a very tough environment not caused necessarily by me. Although the election has, you know, look, the Democrats had a tremendous opportunity because the electoral college, as I said, is so skewed to them. You start off by losing in New York and California, no matter who it is. If, if Abe Lincoln came back to life, he would lose New York and he would lose California. It’s just the registration, there’s nothing you can do. So you’re losing the two biggest states, that’s where you start. OK. The Electoral College is so skewed in favor of a Democrat that it’s very, very hard. Look at Obama’s number in the Electoral College. His numbers on the win were … but the Electoral College numbers were massive. You lose New York, you lose Illinois. Illinois is impossible to win. And you look at, so now you lose New York, Illinois, no matter what you do, and California. Right. And you say, man. Now you have to win Florida, you have to win Ohio, you have to win North Carolina. You have to win all these states, and then I won Wisconsin and Michigan and all of these other places, but you remember there was no way to, there was no way to 270. AP: Right. TRUMP: So she had this massive advantage, she spent hundreds of millions of dollars more money than I spent. Hundreds of millions … Yeah. Or more, actually because we were $375 she was at $2.2 billion. But whatever. She spent massive amounts of money more and she lost. Solidly lost, because you know it wasn’t 270, it was 306. So there’s anger. But there was massive anger before I got there, so it’s not easy for a White House staff to realize that you are going into a situation where you are going to be at no, where are going to get no votes. I mean, here’s a judge who is No. 1 at Columbia, No. 1 at Harvard and an Oxford scholar. And he got three votes. AP: Three Democratic votes, but yeah. TRUMP: Three Democratic votes. OK. He’s an Oxford scholar at the highest level. The No. 1, you know, one of the great academics, one of the great writers. No bad decisions with all … nothing. He’s like a … AP: Do you think that you can break through that? I mean this — TRUMP: Yeah, I do. AP: Is one of the biggest challenges for a president. TRUMP: I think (I) can to an extent. But there’s a, there’s a basic hard-line core that you can’t break though, OK, that you can’t break through. There’s a hard-line group you can’t break through, you can’t. It’s sad. You can’t. Look, I met with Congressman Cummings and I really liked him, a lot. Elijah Cummings (of Maryland). I really liked him a lot. And during the conversation because we have a very strong mutual feeling on drug prices. He came to see me, at my invitation, because I saw him talking about, he came to see me about drug prices because drug prices are ridiculous. And I am going to get them way, way, way down and he liked that. He said you will be the greatest president. He said you will be, in front of five, six people, he said you will be the greatest president in the history of this country. AP: He disputed that slightly. TRUMP: That’s what he said. I mean, what can I tell you? AP: Yeah. TRUMP: There’s six people sitting here. What did he, what, what do you mean by slightly? AP: He said, he said that he felt like you could be a great president if and then — TRUMP: Well he said, you’ll be the greatest president in the history of, but you know what, I’ll take that also, but that you could be. But he said, will be the greatest president but I would also accept the other. In other words, if you do your job, but I accept that. Then I watched him interviewed and it was like he never even was here. It’s incredible. I watched him interviewed a week later and it’s like he was never in my office. And you can even say that. ___ AP: And that’s one of the difficulties I think presidents have had is that you can have these personal relationships with people from the other party, but then it’s hard to actually change how people vote or change how people — TRUMP: No I have, it’s interesting, I have, seem to get very high ratings. I definitely. You know Chris Wallace had 9.2 million people, it’s the highest in the history of the show. I have all the ratings for all those morning shows. When I go, they go double, triple. Chris Wallace, look back during the Army-Navy football game, I did his show that morning. AP: I remember, right. TRUMP: It had 9.2 million people. It’s the highest they’ve ever had. On any, on air, (CBS “Face the Nation” host John) Dickerson had 5.2 million people. It’s the highest for “Face the Nation” or as I call it, “Deface the Nation.” It’s the highest for “Deface the Nation” since the World Trade Center. Since the World Trade Center came down. It’s a tremendous advantage. I have learned one thing, because I get treated very unfairly, that’s what I call it, the fake media. And the fake media is not all of the media. You know they tried to say that the fake media was all the, no. The fake media is some of you. I could tell you who it is, 100 percent. Sometimes you’re fake, but — but the fake media is some of the media. It bears no relationship to the truth. It’s not that Fox treats me well, it’s that Fox is the most accurate. AP: Do you believe that? That Fox — TRUMP: I do. I get treated so badly. Yesterday, about the thing, you know when I said it’s a terrorism … it may be. I said it may be a terrorist attack and MSNBC, I heard, went crazy, “He called it a terrorist attack.” They thought it was a bank robbery. By the way, I’m 10-0 for that. I’ve called every one of them. Every time they said I called it way too early and then it turns out I’m … Whatever. Whatever. In the meantime, I’m here and they’re not. ___ AP: Do you feel that one of the things with cable is there’s such real-time reaction with everything you say? TRUMP: Yeah. AP: Can you separate that sometimes from that actual decision? TRUMP: The one thing — AP: That you have to do — TRUMP: OK. The one thing I’ve learned to do that I never thought I had the ability to do. I don’t watch CNN anymore. AP: You just said you did. TRUMP: No. No, I, if I’m passing it, what did I just say (inaudible)? AP: You just said — TRUMP: Where? Where? AP: Two minutes ago. TRUMP: No, they treat me so badly. No, I just said that. No, I, what’d I say, I stopped watching them. But I don’t watch CNN anymore. I don’t watch MSNBC. I don’t watch it. Now I heard yesterday that MSNBC, you know, they tell me what’s going on. AP: Right. TRUMP: In fact, they also did. I never thought I had the ability to not watch. Like, people think I watch (MSNBC’s) “Morning Joe.” I don’t watch “Morning Joe.” I never thought I had the ability to, and who used to treat me great by the way, when I played the game. I never thought I had the ability to not watch what is unpleasant, if it’s about me. Or pleasant. But when I see it’s such false reporting and such bad reporting and false reporting that I’ve developed an ability that I never thought I had. I don’t watch things that are unpleasant. I just don’t watch them. AP: And do you feel like that’s, that’s because of the office that you now occupy — TRUMP: No. AP: That you’ve made that change? TRUMP: I don’t know why it is, but I’ve developed that ability, and it’s happened over the last, over the last year. AP: That’s interesting. TRUMP: And I don’t watch things that I know are going to be unpleasant. CNN has covered me unfairly and incorrectly and I don’t watch them anymore. A lot of people don’t watch them anymore, they’re now in third place. But I’ve created something where people are watching … but I don’t watch CNN anymore. I don’t watch MSNBC anymore. I don’t watch things, and I never thought I had that ability. I always thought I’d watch. AP: Sure. TRUMP: I just don’t. And that’s taken place over the last year. And you know what that is, that’s a great, it’s a great thing because you leave, you leave for work in the morning you know, you’re, you don’t watch this total negativity. I never thought I’d be able to do that and for me, it’s so easy to do now. Just don’t watch. AP: That’s interesting. TRUMP: Maybe it’s because I’m here. I don’t know.   Share this: Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window) Related Post TagsChina Donald Trump North Korea Categories Macau Share This Post Related Posts Gaming | Revenue growth could be stalled by China’s macro drop Secretary agrees to review affordable housing rules Diversified products needed to attract returning visitors Labor | HK to receive Cambodian domestic helpers No Comments Cancel Reply Notify me of follow-up comments by email.

Reuters/Stringer/File Photo SHANGHAI/PARIS - When China unveiled an historic order for its first large commercial jetliner at a national air show in 2010, Western journalists were kept away, and only local media were allowed to witness a major turning point in China's aviation ambitions. The COMAC C919 jet is expected to stage its maiden flight in the coming weeks, and foreign media and potential buyers will be invited in force - illustrating how Beijing is adjusting to competition for a slice of global jet sales worth $2 trillion over the next 20 years. But after three years of delays and almost a decade in development, China's answer to the Boeing 737 and its state-owned designers face a daunting phase: selling the jet abroad in a market dominated by Boeing and Airbus . "They will be trying to compete on price against people who are building aircraft at a much faster pace and with more experience, so there's a risk of getting bled dry," said Richard Aboulafia, aerospace analyst at Virginia-based Teal Group. Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC) has some cards to play: its plane has Western engines and avionics coupled with a new design; it's rolling out a pilot training program, expanding international staff and has strong, behind-the-scenes backing from Beijing, industry executives say. And though still unproven, COMAC could be the single biggest threat over the coming decades to the dominance of Boeing and Airbus, both in China's own huge aviation market and, longer-term, overseas. The C919 is the first step to this. Beijing's backing for the single-aisle plane gives COMAC a springboard in the world's fastest-growing domestic market, even though the company acknowledges much bigger hurdles abroad. "You can't compare us to Boeing or Airbus, they're in a different strategic stage... We took half a century to solve the first strategic issue (of plane development), it will also take many years to solve the second (market) problem," said Jeff Cheng, a spokesman for COMAC. "After the first flight, we have to focus and research on how to improve the plane's and COMAC's market competitiveness." Eric Chen, president of Airbus Commercial Aircraft China, welcomed the competition from COMAC, and a China-based spokesman for Boeing congratulated the company on developing the C919. GLOBAL SUPPORT NETWORK The C919 has chalked up 570 firm orders and commitments from 23 customers, mainly Chinese state-backed airlines and leasing companies, but says it is not able to give a breakdown. In comparison, the latest version of the Boeing 737 had more than 3,000 firm orders before it flew last January. Those types of numbers from the two big global plane makers come after decades of trimming costs and honing marketing pitches. The two have global support networks able to respond whenever a jet breaks down just about anywhere, and the number of jets flying makes it easier for airlines to raise loans to buy them. While Chinese financiers have muscled into the global aviation arena, COMAC has a relatively low-key presence at international air shows and has said the C919 will initially be aimed at the domestic market. But there are signs it's adopting a more outward-facing approach. While operating manuals for COMAC's smaller ARJ21 regional jet, which took its first flight in 2007, were written in Mandarin, the C919's will be in English to support sales. COMAC's sales and support networks - it has at least 50 people in its sales and marketing departments, says Cheng - are, however, a fraction of those at Boeing and Airbus. Still, COMAC's home advantage is significant as Chinese airlines are likely to drive airplane demand over the next two decades, buying nearly 7,000 planes - mostly from Boeing and Airbus. "Their sales person is the government," said a Chinese airline executive, who didn't want to be named for risk of damaging business relationships. "As long as the government tells the state airlines to purchase planes, that will happen." Airline executives say the first flight is when COMAC can realistically start discussing deposits and firming up customers, even if the plane still faces years of testing. "We haven't placed a deposit; at the moment it's intentions," said Che Shanglun, chairman of Xiamen Airlines, a subsidiary of China Southern Airlines, which has committed to buying up to 50 of the 158-seat C919s. "We signed for 50, but we actually want to buy 30. We have to see if they're able to produce it... They (COMAC) are very enthusiastic, they meet us every month and send us updates." HOW SAFE IS IT? Executives at two Chinese airlines which have not placed orders for the aircraft said they wanted to see the C919's safety record, as well as the creation of a global support team. The safety certification of the new plane - which state media says will have a catalogue price tag of around $50 million, less than half that of a Boeing 737 or Airbus A320 - could be among the biggest issues for the C919 internationally. Having a plane certified to fly commercially is tough enough even for Western jetmakers as aircraft become more complex and supply chains expand. There is still uncertainty over approvals needed for the C919 to secure a foothold beyond China, with the United States and European Union having the most influence. Although the EU has agreed to recognize some of the checks carried out by China, it is expected to insist on some of its own tests before issuing a safety certificate and is trying to understand where discrepancies between the two systems lie. "We are just at the start of the process," said Patrick Ky, executive director of the European Aviation Safety Agency. The US Federal Aviation Administration did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Without Western approvals, China would only be able to sell to countries that accept its certification standards. Zimbabwe, Bolivia and Tajikistan have previously bought Chinese planes. Without Western certification, "sales of the aircraft in developed economies and many developing economies will be difficult to impossible," said Bradley Perrett, a veteran China watcher at Aviation Week. The C919's only real foreign buyer so far is leasing firm GE Capital Aviation Services, whose parent General Electric co-built the plane's engine with France's Safran. "Only once our plane enters the market and is tested can we see what gaps it has," Cheng said.

The 737-10 would narrow the gap between the 178-220 seat 737-9, which first flew this month and the 185-240 seat A321neo, which dominates the top end of the market for narrow body jets. Boeing has been studying how to solve a tricky problem with the design of the plane’s landing gear, without adding cost or delaying a 2020 target for first deliveries. The sources said a two-part technical solution is being tested and that Boeing is separately talking to airlines with the aim of launching the 737-10 at the Paris Airshow in June. In all, it is said to anticipate a market of 1,000 of the planes. “Boeing is actively engaged in discussions with customers about the 737 MAX 10X,” a spokesman said. “No decision has been made on the airplane and any discussion on timing of a possible launch would be speculative.” Reuters/NAN.

Print Story X Print Story Business April 25, 2017 Share Advertisement Qatar Airways closes in on Italy deal DUBAI: Qatar Airways will finalise a long-negotiated agreement to buy 49 percent of Italy´s Meridiana in the coming days, and soon apply with Qatar´s sovereign wealth fund to start an Indian airline. Qatar Airways will sign the agreement with Italy´s second biggest airline in the next "few days", Chief Executive Akbar al-Baker told reporters in Dubai on Monday. The airline has been negotiating to buy a stake in Meridiana for more than year, a deal that could help the loss-making Italian carrier´s ability to compete in Europe. Meridiana would operate as a full-service carrier to destinations in Europe and beyond, al-Baker said, with the airline taking delivery of 20 Boeing 737 MAXs from the second quarter of 2018.The 737s will come from a Qatar Airways order of Boeing jets announced last October. Al-Baker declined to say how much Qatar Airways would invest in the Italian carrier. Meridiana, which offers flights to and from the island of Sardinia and other destinations in Italy, is owned by the Aga Khan, a businessman and spiritual leader of the Ismaili Muslims.  Qatar Airways will also apply with the Qatar Investment Authority (QIA) for a domestic Indian airline operating licence in the next few weeks, al-Baker said. The Indian carrier would be majority owned by QIA, with Qatar Airways controlling a minority interest, he said. Manufacturers Airbus, Boeing, Bombardier and Embraer would be welcome to bid for orders from the Indian carrier, al-Baker said.  Qatar Airways has said it plans to operate a domestic Indian carrier with around 100 jets. The Doha-based airline also announced on Monday 12 new destinations to start in 2018, including direct flights to San Francisco in the United States.  The U.S. expansion contrasts with rival Emirates, which said this month it would cut flights on five U.S. destinations from May due to a "significant deterioration" in bookings.   Advertisement Comments Comment Advertisement Topstory 14 van passengers martyred in Kurram blast Opposition MPs tear up pro-PM resolution in Kashmir Assembly Maryam not cleared by SC in Panama case?

The plane is marketed as a platform for advanced pilot training, with the US Air Force considered its primary customer. "The jet handled exactly like the first aircraft and the simulator, meeting all expectations," Boeing Test Pilot for Air Force Programs Matt Giese said in a press release. "The front and back cockpits work together seamlessly and the handling is superior. It's the perfect aircraft for training future generations of combat pilots." The T-X has a single-engine, is twin-tailed, and is double-seated with embedded training technology in the cockpit. "This aircraft was built to Air Force requirements and designed to fulfill the Air Education and Training Command mission," lead test pilot Steve Schmidt said. The T-X is anticipated to replace the venerable T-38 training aircraft that dates back to 1959, and is expected to be operational by 2024. The first model was revealed by Boeing and Saab in 2016, and has been in flight since December of 2016. "Boeing T-X is a production aircraft; it is not a prototype," Boeing has previously said of the aircraft. "The system also includes state-of-the-art ground-based training and a maintenance-friendly design for long-term supportability."

According to an exclusive report Tuesday morning from Reuters and U.S. News & World Report, Boeing Co. (NYSE: BA) is nearing a decision to launch a larger version of its 737 MAX family, the 737-10, following what the company believes is a technical solution to the problem of how to minimize the cost of lengthening the plane to accommodate more seats. Quotes in the article Boeing Co BA ▲ 183.51 +1.45 +0.80% Boeing announced technical specifications for the 737-10 in early March with plans to launch the program before the end of this year and to meet a first delivery scheduled for 2020. Boeing claims the plane will carry the same number of passengers in a two-class configuration as the Airbus A321neo and will have more range. Airbus, of course, disputes the claim. But the question for Boeing is whether to launch the single-aisle 737-10 program at the same time that it is considering a new "middle of the market" dual-aisle passenger jet, unofficially dubbed the 797. The 737-10 and the A321neo would carry about 190 passengers (in a two-class configuration) with a range of around 3,000 to 3,300 nautical miles. An A321LR variant has a range of around 4,000 nautical miles. The 797 would carry 220 to 270 passengers (in two versions of the plane) some 4,500 to 5,000 nautical miles. Airbus claims its A330 dual-aisle plane covers this part of the market. Market reaction to a 737-10 has been lukewarm at best. Air Lease CEO John Plueger thinks the 2020 date for first deliveries is too late. He believes the plane must be delivered in 2019. Boeing estimates the total market of 1,000 for the new airplane. If the reaction to the 737-10 has been tepid, the dual-aisle 797 makes up for it. Boeing has had little to say about this potential new airplane, but one thing the new plane would do is improve Boeing's position in the market for dual-aisle planes, a market it dominated as recently as two years ago. Boeing's dilemma is how to build a dual-aisle plane for the price of a single-aisle plane. For the airlines, the larger plane needs to offer the range, comfort and capacity of a dual-aisle plane at the cost per seat of a single-aisle plane. In the 1990s, Boeing solved the dilemma by offering the 757 single-aisle and the 767 dual-aisle planes. At the time, it had the dual-aisle market almost all to itself. Today, Boeing sees the 737-10 as a replacement for the 757 and the 797 as a replacement for the 767. But does the market need both planes? Aerospace industry analyst Richard Aboulafia of the Teal Group is not convinced: The problem, though, is that the market views Airbus’s A321neo as better able to replace the 757. And while Boeing could change course and make the 797 a new single-aisle jet, that would imply the 737 MAX would merely be an interim product. Orders would take a serious hit. Also, Boeing might find it difficult to differentiate a new large single-aisle from the A321neo, turning this segment into a low-profit commodity product battlefield. The current market demand for larger single-aisle planes like the A321 and the 737-10 is about three times larger than mid-market demand for dual-aisle planes. That could be due to the fact that a true 767 replacement isn't out there. The 797 may be it. Go to MSN Home Go to MSN Money Join the conversation Report Abuse Report inappropriate content Sorry!

Go For Launch Willing to hear your thoughts about Pluto News NASA, Space and Science Go For Launch Manned missions in sight as Kennedy Space Center transitions Richard TribouContact ReporterOrlando Sentinel Privacy Policy It's hard to keep track of all the moving parts at Kennedy Space Center, but Director Robert Cabana this month touched on all of its progress in a panel discussion with five other space center directors at the Space Symposium in Colorado. "Kennedy Space Center is the poster child for change during a time of transition," Cabana said. "In the last six years, we have evolved to be America's premier spaceport. This was KSC six years ago: One government program utilizing all the facilities, paying all the bills. Today it's a totally different story, as we look at Boeing, SpaceX, Blue Origin." The space center that last saw a manned mission take flight in 2011 when Space Shuttle Atlantis launched on STS-135, is progressing toward human spaceflight aboard NASA's Space Launch System. At the same time, Kennedy Space Center is home to four commercial companies building hardware to send humans to space. "You know, if you look at the Kennedy Space Center, five years ago, we had a vision," Cabana said. "We've made that vision a reality. Public-private partnerships work." Elon Musk’s SpaceX has now launched three times from Launch Complex 39A with its Falcon 9 rocket, and that will eventually support the company’s Crew Dragon capsule. The Dragon capsule is currently used for resupply missions of cargo only to the International Space Station. A manned test flight come could as early as 2018. Boeing is working on the CST-100 Starliner at what used to be Orbiter Processing Facility 3 as well as supporting the Air Force X-37 space plane on site. Starliner test flights are schedule for 2018 with the company’s current plan having operational crewed missions to the International Space Station by December 2018. Jeff Bezos’ company Blue Origin is amid construction at a facility to build its New Glenn rocket, and has already two customers to launch satellites from Cape Canaveral. Blue Origin also has plans to use the rocket and capsule for manned missions, but no timetable for that has been given. And Lockheed Martin is using the Operations and Checkout Building to build the Orion spacecraft that will be on board the Space Launch System, starting with Exploration Mission-1. That mission is not currently planned to have humans, although NASA and the Trump administration are performing a feasibility study to weigh the risk of adding a crew to that flight. As of now, though, the first manned SLS mission is supposed to be between 2021 and 2023. As part of the SLS effort, NASA has been prepping all the systems that could be in operation in just a year and half. The Vehicle Assembly Building is now outfitted to support the giant rocket of SLS with its high bay to be complete this month, while the mobile launcher platform that moved the space shuttle from the VAB to the launch pad is set to be complete by September. On the launch pad, the flame trench, fire brick and flame deflector are in progress as well. "I tell my program manager, Mike Bolger, without undue pressure, that KSC will not be the reason that we don't launch on time," Cabana said. Cabana, who was joined by NASA officials from Goddard Space Flight Center, John H. Glenn Research Center, Marshall Space Flight Center, Johnson Space Center and Jet Propulsion Laboratory, outlined for the group gathered in Colorado Springs the geography of where all the progress around the space center is taking place. "We have transformed KSC," he said. "It's not government programs or commercial programs. If we are going to be successful, it's government and commercial. We need them both. they are fully integrated for us to be successful as a nation, and Kennedy is ready to support the future. And I think it's an absolutely outstanding one."

The Politico report did not provide any details on the timing or conditions of his new position, but his diplomatic and military experiences were likely taken into account in his appointment. Former US Ambassador to South Korea Mark Lippert (Yonhap) Boeing has longstanding ties with South Korea, not only as one of the biggest suppliers of passenger and cargo planes, but also as a partner of local defense contractors. A former Navy SEAL who served in Iraq and Afghanistan, Lippert also took up key posts at the National Security Council and the Pentagon under the Barack Obama administration. The 44-year-old envoy returned home last January in line with the inauguration of President Donald Trump. During his three years here, Lippert facilitated timely responses to North Korea’s provocations and policy coordination with Seoul, thanks partly to his old, personal ties with President Obama. An avid fan of the Doosan Bears, he flew back to Seoul to attend the team’s opening game at Jamsil baseball stadium late last month.

پارسی العربية اردو کوردی Türkçe English Mehrnews English Wed 26 April 2017 × Economy Home All News Iran World Politics Economy Culture Technology Sports Photo Cartoon Video Opinion First ATR aircraft to land in Mehrabad on Friday News ID: 3962482 - Wed 26 April 2017 - 09:12 Economy TEHRAN, Apr. 26 (MNA) – A director of Iran Air has announced that the first out of four ATR 72-600 airplanes will arrive in Tehran on Friday April 28 after going through flight tests. The official at Iran's national carrier, Iran Air (Homa), made the announcement adding “the three remaining aircraft are scheduled to fly to Tehran individually on next Sunday, Wednesday and Friday, respectively. It is worth noting that all four airplanes purchased from by the French-Italian aircraft manufacturer ATR have successfully passed primary tests and are conducting pilot takeoffs and landings at Toulouse–Blagnac Airport in France. Additionally, logo of Iran Air has been painted in the fuselage of the manufactured jetliners. Previously on April 25, Iran Air CEO Farhad Parvaresh stated that the Iranian airline will receive four ATR aircraft within three weeks given that the deadline for the French-Italian aircraft manufacturer has expired for a week. Parvaresh also noted that, as per the contract with Boeing, the first Boeing 777 Wide-body jet airliner will be delivered to Homa in a year’s time. He also touched upon the latest status of negotiations with the largest German airline Deutsche Lufthansa AG explaining “not long ago, a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) was sealed with Lufthansa on technical and operational training, catering and corporate restructuring as well as business cooperation. The agreement was recently implemented in the commercial sector though talks are still underway on other provisions. “So far, good progress has been made with Lufthansa for issues like repair, maintenance, pilot training and catering which will probably lead to further cooperation between the two sides,” underlined Iran Air CEO Parvaresh. The French-Italian ATR plane manufacturer has signed a deal with Homa to provide it with 20 planes. This is a third plane manufacturer after Airbus and Boeing had successfully signed lucrative deals with Iran. Efforts to sign a deal with Brazilian manufacturer Embraer had been uninspiring and plans were abandoned in favor of Airbus and Boeing.  HA/3962105/3962409 Related News Deal with ATR to provide Iran with 20 planes Iranian airliner buys 60 Boeing airplanes Iran interested in purchase of 100 Sukhoi superjet planes: Russian Min.

Ex-Ambassador Lippert Becomes Vice President of Boeing Facebook 0 Twitter 0 E-mail More Google+ LinkedIn KakaoStory April 26, 2017 13:04 Mark Lippert Former U.S. Ambassador to Korea Mark Lippert has been appointed a vice president of aircraft giant Boeing, according to news website Politico on Monday. Lippert is expected to be in charge of international government affairs, which presumably means trying to sell airplanes to foreign countries. Lippert was an aide to ex-U.S. President Barack Obama and became the youngest U.S. ambassador here at age 41 in October 2014. He was seriously injured in a slasher attack in downtown Seoul in March 2015. Later he endeared himself to his hosts with frequent social media postings about his enjoyment of local customs, a smattering of Korean phrases and by giving both his son and daughter, who were born here, Korean middle names. He left on Jan 20 after just two years and three month service, after the Donald Trump administration was inaugurated.

By Tracie Mauriello / Post-Gazette Washington Bureau WASHINGTON — One makes bolts. Another makes water purifiers. Several make money from coal. And they all helped President Donald Trump shatter the record for the most money ever raised for a presidential inauguration. Western Pennsylvania companies provided $1.5 million of the $106.7 million raised. Their contributions helped pay for three balls, an appearance by the Radio City Music Hall Rockettes, fireworks and a concert at the Lincoln Memorial with music by Lee Greenwood and Toby Keith. One of the biggest contributions nationally — $1 million — came from Clifford Forrest, owner of Rosebud Mining Co. in Kittaning. Mr. Forrest also gave $100,000 to the Trump campaign, records show. He has been a regular contributor to campaigns for many years. Since 2010, Mr. Forrest gave $482,000 to candidates for federal office on top of $725,000 to candidates for office in Pennsylvania. Most of his contributions went to Republicans. Mr. Forrest did not respond to a request for comment. Many high-dollar contributors received special access to Mr. Trump and his cabinet appointees during inauguration weekend in January, raising questions about whether such treatment of corporations conflicts with the president’s campaign promises. “It’s stunningly hypocritical when you’re telling the public you’re going to ‘drain the swamp’ and that the system is rigged and that special interests have the ear of politicians in Washington and you’re going to be different,” said Alex Howard, spokesman for the Sunlight Foundation, a Washington-based watchdog group that fights for transparency in government. “If you’re going to represent yourself as someone responsible to the people and that you’re a populist fighting for the people who’ve been forgotten, the silent Americans and the people left behind, then how does taking huge amounts of money from corporations connect with that?” Barack Obama forbade corporate giving for his first inauguration. That changed for his second inauguration, whose major contributors included AT&T, Microsoft, Chevron and Boeing. Mr. Obama’s inaugural committee raised $55 million in 2009 and $44 million in 2013. The Trump inaugural committee originally said he hoped to raise $65 to $75 million, and a spokesman recently told the Associated Press that the excess would be given to charity. Because inaugural committees are not required to disclose expenditures it’s unclear how much that is, and critics wonder whether it will be given at all. Their questions stem from the Washington Post’s Pulitzer Prize-winning work revealing that Mr. Trump had not followed through on promises to give millions to veterans groups. “The question is: why create this vector for influence from corporate and wealthy individuals when you don’t need to?” Mr. Howard said. The inaugural committee could have declined contributions once it had enough to pay for the event which, he noted, should have cost less than the Obama inaugurations because it had fewer balls and headliners. The biggest contributor to Mr. Trump’s inauguration was from casino magnate Sheldon Adelson, who provided $5 million. Other top contributors were Bank of America, Boeing, Pfizer, Qualcomm and Dow Chemical, which each contributed at least $1 million. Mr. Forrester was Western Pennsylvania’s only six-figure contributor. Other contributors from the region who gave at least $5,000 were: Consol Energy of Canonsburg, $150,000. Joseph Reschini of Indiana, president of The Reschini Group, $75,000. Jay W. Cleveland Jr. of Cleveland Brothers Equipment Inc. in Murrysville, $50,000. CSE Corp. of Monroeville, $39,100. Reschini Agency of Indiana, $35,000. Ashok Trivedi of Mastech Digital in Moon, $25,000. Lee Supply co. of Charleroi, $20,000. Frank Calandra Inc. of Pittsburgh, $20,000. J-Lok Corp. of Pittsburgh, $15,000. JENNCHEM of Pittsburgh, $10,000. AB Arrison of Mount Morris, $10,000. Global Mine Service of Belle Vernon, $10,000. Melanie A. Schwartz of McMurray, $5,300. Gary L. Morrell of Ellsworth, owner of Royal Hydraulic Services, $5,000. Royal Hydraulic Services of Cokeburg, $5,000. Lincoln Contracting and Equipment Inc. of Boswell, $5,000. Chemstream Inc. of Stoystown, $5,000. Many of those contributors work for energy companies or suppliers that support the energy industry. And Mr. Trump already has been taking steps that support their interests, including in February when he signed a law repealing a regulation that would have required energy companies to disclose royalty payment that oil, gas, coal and mineral companies pay to foreign governments.

The country will need 6,810 aircraft valued at more than $1 trillion in the two decades through 2035, Boeing Co. predicted in September. That would make China the biggest single-country market for planes, and the third-largest as a region, behind Europe and North America. State-backed Commercial Aircraft Corp. of China Ltd. is poised to conduct the first flight of the locally built C919 before the end of May, according to two people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified because the information isn’t public. The test flight is delayed by more than a year. The nation will surpass the U.S. as the world’s largest air-travel market even sooner, around 2024, according to the International Air Transport Association. The number of people flying to, from and within China will jump to 1.3 billion by 2035, compared with 1.1 billion for the U.S., IATA said. Of China’s total plane demand in the 20-year period, 75 percent will be single-aisle -- a category dominated by Boeing’s 737 and Airbus SE’s A320 family that the C919 will be looking to break. China Eastern Airlines Corp. will be the first carrier to take delivery of the C919. Comac received 570 orders as of November for the plane, which will need to be certified by U.S. and European authorities before it can fly there. — With assistance by Dong Lyu Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 25 April 2017 by Maciej Heyman Ballard’s Protonex Subsidiary Powers Successful Test Flights of Boeing Insitu ScanEagle UAV VANCOUVER and SOUTHBOROUGH, MA, April 25, 2017 /PRNewswire/ - Ballard Power Systems (NASDAQ: BLDP; TSX: BLDP) announced that the company's subsidiary, Protonex, has successfully powered test flights of the ScanEagle unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) with the Company's PEM (proton exchange membrane) fuel cell propulsion system. The ScanEagle is manufactured by Insitu (www.insitu.com), a wholly owned subsidiary of The Boeing Company. "These test flights have successfully demonstrated the integration and operation of our fuel cell propulsion system as well as the high pressure hydrogen fuel tank," said Paul Osenar, President of Protonex. "The tests also documented acoustic footprint reduction that will enable mission routes that take the ScanEagle closer to its targets. In addition, test flights confirm that our fuel cell propulsion system offers power during flight that can be used to support greater payload diversity. When combined with improved reliability and other advantages over internal combustion systems, fuel cells are proving to be a tremendous fit for UAVs." Advantages of the Protonex fuel cell propulsion modules over traditional internal combustion engine propulsion systems include: significant improvement in the expected MTBF (mean time between failures) of up to 5x; silent operation; 100% throttle flexibility, including mid-air start-stop capability; and use of existing JP8 fuel in ground refueling systems. Peter Kunz, Insitu's Chief Technology Officer noted, "Insitu continues to progress toward our goal of offering all-electric power and propulsion system options for Insitu platforms. Now in developmental testing, the Protonex fuel cell system has exceeded our power requirements and has integrated very well with the initial target aircraft systems and with general unmanned aerial system, or UAS, operations. Additional performance tests and customer demonstrations are planned throughout the remainder of this year." Insitu's ScanEagle is a versatile platform with multiple payload capabilities, including high-definition imaging at a fraction of the cost of larger UAV systems and has logged over 800,000 flight hours in military and civilian applications, making it one of the most successful UAV platforms to date. The ScanEagle is operated in conjunction with Insitu's Mark4 Launcher – a low-maintenance, runway-independent platform – along with its SkyHook® recovery system. ScanEagle is 1.55 meters (5.1 feet) in length, has a wingspan of 3.11 meters (10.2 feet) and maximum takeoff weight of 22 kilograms (48.5 lbs). The ScanEagle can fly at a maximum speed of 41.2 meters per second (80 knots), reach a ceiling of 5,944 meters (19,500 feet) and has an endurance capability of more than 24-hours.

Now in developmental testing, the Protonex fuel cell system has exceeded our power requirements and has integrated very well with the initial target aircraft systems and with general unmanned aerial system, or UAS, operations. Additional performance tests and customer demonstrations are planned throughout the remainder of this year." Insitu's ScanEagle is a versatile platform with multiple payload capabilities, including high-definition imaging at a fraction of the cost of larger UAV systems and has logged over 800,000 flight hours in military and civilian applications, making it one of the most successful UAV platforms to date. The ScanEagle is operated in conjunction with Insitu's Mark4 Launcher – a low-maintenance, runway-independent platform – along with its SkyHook® recovery system. ScanEagle is 1.55 meters (5.1 feet) in length, has a wingspan of 3.11 meters (10.2 feet) and maximum takeoff weight of 22 kilograms (48.5 lbs). The ScanEagle can fly at a maximum speed of 41.2 meters per second (80 knots), reach a ceiling of 5,944 meters (19,500 feet) and has an endurance capability of more than 24-hours.

Quotes in the article Caterpillar Inc CAT ▲ 104.42 +7.61 +7.86% Boeing Co BA ▲ 183.51 +1.45 +0.80% Amazon.com Inc AMZN ▲ 907.62 +0.21 +0.02% Microsoft Corp MSFT ▲ 67.92 +0.39 +0.58% AdChoices The Nasdaq composite jumped 0.7 percent, sending the index above 6,000 for this first time ever. "It's certainly a psychological factor," said Jeff Carbone, managing partner of Cornerstone Financial Partners. "It took us many years to get back above 5,000 and now we're at 6,000. But you've got to be careful." He noted that about 40 percent of the index is being driven by five companies: Amazon, Facebook, Netflix, Alphabet and Apple. "If we see a downturn in those names," the index could be in trouble. The Dow rose 232 points, closing just shy of the 21,000 level, with Caterpillar and McDonald's contributing the most gains. The S&P 500 advanced 0.6 percent, with financials and materials rising more than 1 percent to lead advancers. "I think we've come to believe that Q1 is soft because of some reason that economists or market analysts haven't been able to pinpoint," said Kim Forrest, senior equity analyst at Fort Pitt Capital. "That doesn't seem to be happening now." "Earnings thus far have been good," said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at First Standard Financial. "That's a good sign that Corporate America is on a renewed path toward growth." More than 190 S&P components are expected to have reported by the end of the week. Other big names scheduled to release quarterly results this week include Boeing, Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft and General Motors. The major U.S. stock indexes soared on Monday after the first round of the French presidential election went as most investors expected. Centrist Emmanuel Macron advanced to the runoff against far-right candidate Marine Le Pen. The runoff is scheduled for May 7. "I have to say I was surprised because what happened with Marine Le Pen is what we were expecting. So why get got a bump off that is interesting," said Maris Ogg, president at Tower Bridge Advisors. "But I think that removed a big cloud [over the market] and people are starting to focus on the fundamentals again." Nevertheless, investors also zeroed in on Washington, as President Donald Trump tried to avoid a government shutdown. Government funding will end Friday unless Congress can agree on at least a temporary funding resolution. The Trump administration is also expected to release an outline to potential tax reform later this week. Tax reform expectations have been one of the key market drivers since the presidential election. "Earnings and tax reform are the main story" in the market, said Bruce Bittles, chief investment strategist at Baird. "For two months, we were in a consolidation phase and now we have the Nasdaq at an all-time high." Overseas, European equities rose broadly, with the pan-European Stoxx 600 index 0.21 percent. In Asia, stocks closed mostly higher, with the Shanghai composite rising 0.16 percent and the Nikkei 225 advancing 1.08 percent. In economic news, U.S. home prices rose more than expected in February, according to new data from the S&P/Case-Shiller U.S. National Home Price Index. The national home price index jumped 5.8 percent in February, while analysts were expecting home prices to climb by 5.7 percent. New home sales rose 5.8 percent to 621,000 in March, above expectations. Consumer confidence held at 120.3 for April.  CNBC's Lauren Thomas contributed to this report.

TTB Webmaster No comments yet Obits 63 Views Related Walter Lee Kohl Margie McPhie Patton Death Notice: Fredrick Roddy April 25, 2017 Martha Jean Hicks Butler Martha Jean Hicks Butler, beloved wife, mother, great-grandmother, sister, aunt, and friend returned to her Heavenly Father and dear husband on April 21, 2017. She was born on June 4, 1934, to Matthew Henry Hicks and Genevieve Susan Dean in Grand Junction, Colorado. Martha’s early years were spent in the beautiful high mountain valley of Gunnison, Colorado. She moved to the Tooele Valley in her early teen years. Through family acquaintances, she met and eventually married the love of her life, Farrell Butler, on July 23, 1951. Their marriage was solemnized for time and all eternity in the Salt Lake Temple in 1958. Martha and Farrell with their young family lived in Seattle, Washington, where Farrell worked for Boeing Aircraft. Eventually, they returned to Grantsville where they spent the “best years of their lives.” Most important to Martha were her family, church and community. She supported her many children, grandchildren and great grandchildren in all of their activities. Martha was so proud of each one’s accomplishments, whatever that might be. She was the Grantsville Cowboys’ No. 1 fan, no matter what the sport. Many a time, her ‘yell’ could be heard by all in attendance. She really enjoyed watching the Grantsville Cowboys, Utah Utes, BYU Cougars and Utah Jazz. If you needed to know a score, you could just ask Grandma. It was through Martha’s strong faith in her Savior that she was able to witness many miracles during her life. She served faithfully, never wavering, in many callings in the LDS Church. Whether it was teaching in primary, serving in scouts, or Relief Society, she did it joyfully. Martha and Farrell were the founding directors of the Grantsville Family History Center, served a mission at the LDS Employment Center in Tooele, and were temple workers in the Salt Lake Temple. She was grateful to serve wherever she was called. Kind, loving, and caring are the words that best describe Martha. She always put others first, greeted everyone with a smile, and in her loving way would say, “you are special!” Martha’s home was always open to those in need. Martha and Farrell spent over 64 years together enjoying each other’s company and raising a family of seven children and a nephew to whom they truly devoted their lives. It is difficult to express the love and gratitude her children feel for their parents growing up together as a family in Grantsville. From the oldest to the youngest, they are Wayne (Jeannine), Linda Christiansen (Steve), Bob (Belinda), Curtis (Pam), Jolene Droubay (Scott), John (Marjorie) and Christie Carlson (Todd). Martha is survived by her seven children; 24 grandchildren and 29 great-grandchildren (with one on the way); sister-in-law Leila Riding and many nieces and nephews who she loved dearly. She was preceded in death by her parents, siblings, and nephew Raddie, whom she raised many years as a son. Funeral services for Martha were held Tuesday, April 25, 2017, at 1 p.m. at the LDS Chapel located at 428 S. Hale Street in Grantsville, Utah. Viewings were held Monday, April 24 from 6-8 p.m. and Tuesday from 11 a.m.-12:30 p.m. prior to service at the same location. Interment followed at the Grantsville Cemetery. A special thanks to medical professionals who cared for Martha through the years and most recently the staff at the Huntsman Cancer Institute, Harmony Home Health and Didericksen Memorial for their loving care of Martha.

Fracking has really taken off in the past few years, but how does it work? Our energy analysts explain the ins and outs and name a few of the best companies investors will want to look at. Taylor Muckerman and Sean O'Reilly (TMFrunAMuck) Apr 25, 2017 at 2:15PM Fracking is where it's at for U.S. oil production, but it's more than a little complicated. In this week's episode of Industry Focus: Energy, Motley Fool analysts Sean O'Reilly and Taylor Muckerman walk investors through what they need to know about the fracking process and about some of the best-established businesses in the industry. Find out how the new technology lets drillers access more oil, what steps frackers take to make the process cleaner, a few ways investors can get exposure to the space without buying directly into an exploration company, and more. Also, the hosts look into the sudden seat change at Arconic (NYSE:ARNC), where CEO Klaus Kleinfeld has been abruptly ousted from his position by investment-management company Elliott Management. A full transcript follows the video. This video was recorded on April 20, 2017. Sean O'Reilly: Welcome to Industry Focus, the podcast that dives into a different sector of the stock market every day. Today is Thursday, April 20, 2017, so we're talking about energy, materials, and industrials. I am your host, Sean O'Reilly, and to my left is Motley Fool Premium analyst and St. Louis Cardinals die-hard, Mr. Taylor Muckerman. What's up, Taylor? Taylor Muckerman: Sporting my red today, got a sweep yesterday, first series win. O'Reilly: You feeling good? Muckerman: Better. O'Reilly: Very good. I'm a Cleveland Indians fan. We're not going to talk about last year. Muckerman: I would talk about last year. You lost in Game 7, but you still went to the World Series. O'Reilly: How far did you guys get? Muckerman: Oh, funny. That's why I'm saying, I would want to talk about last year if I was you. O'Reilly: Thank you. If I were you? We need a couple of those editors from upstairs. Muckerman: Yeah, hold up paper on the glass. "You said that wrong!" O'Reilly: Use your commas! So, on today's show, we're going to walk our Foolish listeners through the fracking process. I know that sounds really attractive, doesn't it? Muckerman: We use the word a lot, but we haven't ever really described it. O'Reilly: That's true. And we'll, of course, mention a few interesting companies along the way, maybe some cool fracking sand companies. Muckerman: If our listeners ask politely. O'Reilly: We should have a chat sometime, "Tweet at us right now if you want ... " Muckerman: We could. We do live chats with our members. We could do a live stream using Slido. O'Reilly: Could we use Slido? Muckerman: Yeah, you just have to throw a password over the podcast, and if people listen to it they get treated with the password. O'Reilly: And, of course, the password, if you had to pick, would be Go Cardinals!, or something. Muckerman: No, then people who don't listen every week wouldn't be able to figure it out. O'Reilly: Yeah, OK. So we'll walk through the fracking process. But first, we have to briefly talk about what's going on with Arconic. Basically, this week, the sudden ouster of its CEO Klaus Kleinfeld. Arconic is the lightweight metals and engineering manufacturer. It's the successor -- Muckerman: Well, not successor, because Alcoa (NYSE:AA) still exists.  O'Reilly: It spun off the original aluminum production operations, and this is the advanced stuff. So Alcoa took the name. Muckerman: Alcoa kept the aluminum production, and they spun off the aluminum products division into Arconic. O'Reilly: Yeah. It was interesting to me, because in every press release I've ever seen for this, or analysis, Arconic is not mentioned as a spinoff. It's just, "We're separating, and that's it." Muckerman: Yeah, I guess maybe not a spinoff, technically.  O'Reilly: But bottom line, that's just semantics to this point. This happened about six months ago. The guy that steered Arconic through this process of becoming an individual company was, again, CEO Klaus Kleinfeld. Total surprise -- it was announced on April 17 that Kleinfeld has been forced out by investment manager Elliott Management. This is actually where it gets even weirder. Arconic said that Mr. Kleinfeld's exit came after he sent an unauthorized letter to Elliott Management, that Arconic's board of directors said showed poor judgement. The company then said that Mr. Kleinfeld is stepping down by mutual agreement. I don't know what was in this letter. That sounds awesome. If somebody knows, tweet at me, I guess. Elliott said in a statement that the letter from Mr. Kleinfeld "read as a threat to intimidate or extort a senior officer of Elliott Management based on completely false insinuations, a threat that we took seriously and about which we immediately and privately informed the board." Whoa. Muckerman: Yeah, I would believe them if they didn't already want him out of there for over a year. This is just their excuse. O'Reilly: That's the final cap on this whole -- Muckerman: They were probably poking the bear for a year, and he finally woke up from hibernation. O'Reilly: Arconic is going to have a shareholder meeting on May 16, and they had it on the docket to get him out. That letter, I want to know what's in that letter. That sounds insane, from a professional CEO of a large corporation. Muckerman: Yeah. If you're a shareholder of Alcoa -- because he's been the CEO of Alcoa before the split -- he pushed back against the split in 2012 and 2013, when the price of commodities started to fall, eventually succumbing to investors' demands, and successfully overseeing the split and then taking control as the CEO of Arconic. He's a visionary. He has long-term visions for Arconic, not these near-term visions that Elliott Management has. If you look at his success at Alcoa and Arconic now as a businessman and a relationship man with their customers, Boeing was going to go all composites, they were going to completely eliminate the aluminum products that they used from Alcoa and now Arconic. He had the CEO come to their plant, they hashed it out, and they proved that they needed to remain an Arconic customer. And it's one of their biggest contracts. And then you see the CEOs of Airbus, on top of Boeing, United Technologies, and to [General Electric] Aviation all voicing their support for Klaus Kleinfeld. But Elliott Management, they have some ulterior motives, some short-term motives, I'm sure. O'Reilly: This is not news, yeah. Muckerman: The stock did pop a little bit, but all these reports you see about his track record in the market for Alcoa, all say, "Oh, this stock's done so poorly since he's been there!" But they never mention the fact that the price of aluminum has also done quite poorly since he was CEO. O'Reilly: Right. Lemons out of lemonade. Last thing before we move on, what you were talking about, he's a visionary. When the split happened six months ago, I saw it mentioned in The Wall Street Journal, he had this big, long production video of the future, 60 years from now. And he's like, "We're going to build the future, these towers, with robots, we're going to build it all," and it's like, oh my gosh, this guy is thinking long-term. Muckerman: Using Arconic's products. As Fools, we appreciate that, and as Fools, we don't appreciate, at least I don't appreciate, what happened. I'm going to keep my eye on him and see where he ends up. If he doesn't choose to retire, I think somebody is going to want him on their board, or in their C-suite. I'd be interested which company that is. Hopefully they're public so I can follow along.  O'Reilly: We've been doing this for a year and a half together. We've talked a lot about fracking. It's kind of all we talk about. Muckerman: Well, it's what's disrupted the industry over the last decade or so, and it's what put American oil and natural gas back on the map. O'Reilly: I have a good friend who's a petroleum geologist. I remember when he was in school 10 years ago, he gave a presentation about this, and I happened to be on campus. I was just passing through. He was talking about this and how revolutionary it was. He was talking about -- we're going to talk about it in a second -- drilling sideways and all this stuff. It was a big deal, and we hadn't been able to do that until recently. So, first and foremost, we need to clarify some terms. Fracking is actually what happens after a well is drilled. We've been drilling oil wells for over a hundred years. Muckerman: The technology there has definitely improved, but it's not what fracking is. O'Reilly: Have you ever been to Drake's Well, Pa.? Muckerman: I haven't. That's the original, right? O'Reilly: It's so anticlimatic. Muckerman: Yeah, I'm sure. Kind of like the geyser in Yellowstone. Whatever, dude. O'Reilly: The actual well drilling, which, again, going down, we can now go 360 degrees around. That immediately makes any given oil well more valuable. You used to just drill a hole and oil would come up, and that would be it. Muckerman: And you would have to go straight down. But we're going up to 10,000, maybe even a little further down now. O'Reilly: I saw this graphic, and they had Empire State Buildings down. Muckerman: Yeah, multiple Empire State Buildings. O'Reilly: Yeah, they had, like, five. Muckerman: We can go over a mile horizontally once we're a couple miles below the surface. We're not just going straight horizontal anymore. We have directional drilling, where it's basically like a video game -- O'Reilly: Does the bit do any dances, like a shimmy-shimmy? Muckerman: I imagine the movie Tremors, with that big monster eating its way through the ground, and choosing its path at will. O'Reilly: Do you think they saw the movie and thought, "We need to do that"? Muckerman: Yeah. I mean, it's not doing spirals. It has to have some sort of straight direction to it, because they have to have the casings and cement to fortify it. But yeah, we're not just going at a 90-degree angle anymore. O'Reilly: Correct me, but, basically, when they're doing all these drills and the fracking, which we're going to touch upon in a second, a lot of what they do is to basically make sure the hole stays in place and together. Muckerman: Yeah, a lot of pipe and a lot of cement go into this process. The first thousand or so feet, I don't know, it depends on the water level, but they have to protect them first and foremost. O'Reilly: And that gets cased in cement. Muckerman: It does. They lower the piping down, and before they drill any further, they force cement down the hole, and wraps around the pipe at the bottom, and then upfills, and once it's cemented then they can use the drill bit to drill back through the hardened cement, and then they can continue drilling down to the oil and natural gas. First and foremost, they're protecting the water level. O'Reilly: So they're making a thousand-foot straw out of cement. Muckerman: The whole thing is a straw, but that's the most heavily protected part of the straw. O'Reilly: OK, and that's so things don't collapse -- Muckerman: Well, that and so we don't mess up the water table. O'Reilly: Important also. Muckerman: Yeah, so the oil and natural gas aren't seeping out into the water table through cracks in the casings. Basically, what you can imagine is, the top of this hole has the widest casing, and then they just put smaller and smaller casings down through, so it's kind of like a police baton when they snap it out. O'Reilly: Right, or an inverted skyscraper. That's actually a good analogy, the baton. Respect. So, hydraulic fracturing is the use of -- this is what I got offline -- fluid and material to create and restore small fractures and rock formations. One that hopefully has oil and natural gas in it, of course. Muckerman: Yes, you would hope. There's companies out there that help them arrive at that conclusion. O'Reilly: Right. So, historically, you find these geologic formations, and we know the types of rock that usually have reservoirs of oil. That's easy. Muckerman: Yeah, that's called conventional oil. O'Reilly: Yeah, that's conventional oil, and it's easy. It's drilling a hole and There Will Be Blood. Muckerman: Big basins, generally long-lasting wells. O'Reilly: Right. That's what Saudi Arabia has with their Ghawar Field; that's what we're talking about here. This is going down there thousands of feet, and there's oil stuck between the tiniest of rocks. It's actually crazy to think about, that we're getting it out. Muckerman: Yeah, it's thin layers that are separated by sediment and rock. So they drop a wire line into these drilled wells and send an electrical charge through this wire that then creates, like you said, a small explosion, and they do it over stages. O'Reilly: Are you saying they're fracturing the rock, Taylor? Muckerman: They are, they're fracturing the rock. Through the steel casing, and then through the rock, with pellets and things that diffuse reaction. They do it in stages. That's one reason why we're producing more oil now, because we're being able to tighten the spacing, so we can have more stages per well. They frack, they plug, they frack, they plug, they frack, they plug. Then, once they've fracked all the stages, they remove the plugs, and then they start the process of forcing the fluids and proppants down into the fractures. O'Reilly: This is like putting a man on the moon. This is really complex. Muckerman: Maybe even more complicated. O'Reilly: You ever hear the computers they used for the first Apollo 11, the original Game Boy had more computing power than those computers. Muckerman: Yeah, now you're just walking around with several of those in your pocket. O'Reilly: Yeah. We've covered a lot of ground here. What companies -- Muckerman: Yeah, there's companies in every stage of this. O'Reilly: If I have some acreage in the Delaware basin over there in West Texas, one, I'm obviously a millionaire, automatically. But do I sell the land to EOG Resources or Pioneer [Natural Resources] and call it a day? Or can I hire a company to just do the fracking for me? Muckerman: EOG and the exploration and production companies aren't necessarily buying the land. Maybe sometimes they do, but they're leasing it. Then, as an acreage holder, you get lease payments, and you probably negotiate some royalties on top of that. O'Reilly: So that's what I would do, theoretically. Muckerman: Yeah, theoretically, yeah. We're not going to talk about the producers today, because those are some of the bigger names we mention all the time, because they're the folks that are most directly impacted by the price of oil. But yeah, you're calling companies, A, you can call a company that can do pretty much everything, which is going to be a Schlumberger, Halliburton, Baker Hughes, or Weatherford -- those are the ExxonMobil of the drilling and fracking world. They do everything. O'Reilly: But they do not own or produce or sell the oil. Muckerman: They don't. Maybe there's some kind of way that they can negotiate a contract with royalties, but no, for the most part, you're buying a stock in these companies because they're going to do the dirty work. O'Reilly: And then they get a day rate, and that's it. Muckerman: They get a day rate for the rigs, and then for all the equipment they use, and rental prices and things like that, yeah. O'Reilly: So all along, they were giving oil companies a break on these day rates and stuff. But now, they're like, "All right, now that oil is up, we need to ... " Muckerman: They have to eat, too. So you get them to provide some of the equipment to do the drilling, to do the fracking, to do the completing. And then once the oil starts flowing, they throw the wellhead on it, sometimes call it a Christmas tree because that's what it looks like when it's sitting on top of the well. Then, once the oil is producing -- O'Reilly: On to the next one. Muckerman: They clean their hands with some of the orange automotive soap that really degreases everything, and then they move on to the next one. Another reason why we're producing and drilling so much more efficiently is because we have what we call pad drilling now, where they basically put some of these rigs on tracks, and without disassembling them like they used to have to do, they used to have to take apart the drilling rig every single time. O'Reilly: I'm picturing a crane. Muckerman: It's like a bulldozer or a tank. It's basically on a track. It's called pad drilling, where they can slide it over to the next well site. Disassembling these rigs was the bulk of the time these companies were spending on actual drilling. O'Reilly: You can imagine it's complex. Muckerman: Yeah, exactly. And if one bolt is wrong, you're screwed. O'Reilly: Let's talk a bit about water and sand. Muckerman: Water and sand make up about 98%-99% of what you're forcing down there, and then you have some chemical additives that are used for -- O'Reilly: Like slickwater solutions, whatever that is. Muckerman: -- to reduce the growth of bacteria, which can be dangerous, releasing gases. It also provides a bit more of a fluid environment. Yeah, predominantly water and frack sand and some sort of proppant, depending on what kind of well you're drilling. O'Reilly: There are companies like U.S. Silica and Hi-Crush Partners that literally just make the sand for these guys. Muckerman: Yeah. U.S. Silica is not just sand. I don't even know if they do just strictly sand. O'Reilly: Silica implies some kind of glass, too. Muckerman: Yeah, they can actually create a very specific proppant for a specific well. O'Reilly: Based upon the geologic properties that are downstairs. Muckerman: Yeah. And a company like Core Labs can tell you what kind of proppant might work best, because they're a core and fluid analysis company that's used by pretty much everybody in the business. O'Reilly: And you can send them a core to their lab and make them tell you stuff. Muckerman: You can send it to them; they can come get it for you. We visited them a couple years ago, and they were telling us that companies even as big as Exxon and Chevron were outsourcing their core sample analysis to Core Labs because they did it so much better than everybody else. But they've been hurt recently because their future was very heavily reliant on deepwater, so once that comes around, maybe that's another company to look at. But you analyze the core sample, and then you can determine your water to sand, water to proppant chemical ratio that's specific for each individual well. Again, technology helping us produce more oil and natural gas per individual well. O'Reilly: All this stuff, over the last five years, I assume they've been getting better at what we just described even in just the last five years and that's kind of what we're talking about with these companies lowering their cost of production even since 2012. Muckerman: But you look at these companies using much more sand -- so, not only the companies you mentioned, but CARBO Ceramics as well, and a couple smaller ones, Fairmount Santrol Holdings and Emerge Energy Services, all companies you can look at on the proppant side of the business -- as these companies use more and more proppants, demand should drive the price up, as long as they don't create too much supply too soon. O'Reilly: Right. Before we finish up here, what's the flushing stage? It's just using water to flush out the well when you're done? Muckerman: Basically, yeah. Clean up on aisle oil. But a lot of these companies now, the wells aren't being cleaned out as quickly because they're going back and using carbon dioxide to go back in and try to force more oil out. O'Reilly: And that's usually on really old wells, as I understand. Muckerman: Yeah, really old wells. They're even going back and trying to fracture conventionally drilled wells -- O'Reilly: From 100 years ago, I hear, sometimes. Muckerman: You're not getting nearly 100% of the oil and natural gas out of these wells. I would be surprised if some of these wells or even reaching 70% or 80%. O'Reilly: The conventional wells? Muckerman: Yeah. And fracking wells are leaving even more, percentage-wise, in the ground than conventional. You're going back and trying to use carbon dioxide, more water flowing through these, and refracking things in different stages after they've exhausted the conventional resource. There's a lot of activity going on -- not only those companies that we've mentioned, but National Oilwell Varco, huge equipment supplier. If you're looking at the drilling rigs, Nabors is the largest land drilling rig provider in the United States. O'Reilly: Distribution NOW gets these guys all the parts that they need when things happen. Muckerman: Helmerich & Payne is a very widely respected rig operator and rig manufacturer. Then, Patterson-UTI as well. Different stages. If you want the whole thing outside of the proppants, look at a Halliburton, Schlumberger, Baker Hughes, or Weatherford. If you want to get more specific, you can go proppants with the companies we mentioned -- U.S. Silica, Hi-Crush Partners, CARBO Ceramics, and those other smaller ones. Then, if you want the rig providers and operators, Helmerich & Payne, Patterson-UTI, and Nabors. They do other things, but that's the bread and butter of those three companies, the rig and drilling side of it. O'Reilly: Cool. Thanks for your thoughts, Mr. Muckerman. Muckerman: Yeah, I appreciate it. It's very important, it's going on all over the United States and the world, eventually, on the same scale that we have here. O'Reilly: Watch out. Muckerman: Yeah, you can definitely not invest in the exploration and production companies and still profit from fracking. O'Reilly: Awesome, cool. That is it for us, folks.

That’s what’s happening to Lockheed Martin Corp. (NYSE: LMT) Tuesday morning, but the effects are not rippling through other defense contractors as we might have expected to see. Lockheed missed first-quarter earnings estimates by $0.18 per share (nearly 6.5%) and revenues by $170 million (about 1.5%). The company also chopped its full-year earnings per share (EPS) estimate by a dime (about 0.8%). Lockheed did raise its full-year operating cash flow guidance by $300 million to $6 billion. Sales of the company’s F-35 joint strike fighter rose by about $305 million and sales of the F-16 rose by $60 million. But the F-35 program has come under increasing scrutiny by the Trump administration and under some pressure from Boeing Co. (NYSE: BA), which has been promoting an upgraded F-18 as a cheaper and roughly equivalent option to more F-35s. In general, though, defense contractors are living large based on investors’ belief that the Trump administration will boost defense spending. The S&P 1500 index is trading at 16 times the consensus 2018 EPS estimates; the top five defense contractors are trading anywhere from 17 to 19 times the estimate. So, where Lockheed is taking a hit this morning, other defense contractors’ stocks appear to have overcome downbeat openings and turned positive. Boeing, for instance, started off the day in the green following a report that the company is preparing to launch its much-discussed 737-10 program in about two months at the Paris Air Show. The shares traded up nearly 1% Tuesday morning, at $183.68 in a 52-week range of $122.35 to $185.71. The consensus price target on the stock is $181.90, and the company’s multiple to estimated 2018 earnings is 17.9. General Dynamics Corp. (NYSE: GD) saw shares trading roughly flat at $191.92, in a 52-week range of $132.68 to $194. The stock’s 12-month price target is $203.06. General Dynamics reports earnings before the opening bell on Wednesday and is expected to post EPS of $2.32 ($2.08 last year) and revenues of $7.71 billion ($7.72 billion last year). The stock’s price multiple to expected 2018 EPS is 18.14. Raytheon Co. (NYSE: RTN), maker of the Tomahawk missiles used in the attack on a Syrian airport earlier this month, reports first-quarter results Thursday morning and analysts are looking for EPS of $1.61 ($1.43 a year ago) and revenues of $5.83 billion ($5.76 last year). Shares traded up almost 0.3% Tuesday morning at $156.44 in a 52-week range of $124.98 to $157.59. The consensus price target is $169.17, and the multiple to expected to 2018 earnings is 18.88 Northrop Grumman Corp. (NYSE: NOC) traded up about 0.2% Tuesday morning, at $249.55 in a 52-week range of $200.55 to $253.80. The stock’s 12-month price target is $258.06. Northrop reports earnings on Thursday morning and is expected to post EPS of $2.92 ($3.03 last year) and revenues of $6.14 billion ($5.96 billion a year ago). The stock’s price-to-2018 consensus earnings estimate is 18.69. Lockheed traded down about 2.3% after reporting earnings Tuesday morning. Shares traded at $269.98 in a 52-week range of $227.85 to $276.64. The consensus 12-month price target is $281.05, and the multiple to 2018 estimated EPS is 19.16.

Airline spokeswoman Erin Benson says the two-engine Boeing 737 circled to burn fuel, then returned Monday to the airport in Liberia, Costa Rica. She says the plane was over normal landing weight, so fire crews stood by at the airport. A reporter among the 165 passengers tweeted that it was a frightening experience. Aviation-safety consultant John Cox says Boeing 737s can’t dump fuel but are designed to land slightly overweight. He says it sounds like the United crew did everything right, including throttling back and returning to Costa Rica on one engine. Sign up for the online chat with Air Force Deputy CIO Bill Marion II on May 9, at 10 a.m. (EDT). Advertisement Benson says the passengers will get compensation and fly to Houston on Tuesday.

"It's certainly a psychological factor," said Jeff Carbone, managing partner of Cornerstone Financial Partners. "It took us many years to get back above 5,000 and now we're at 6,000. But you've got to be careful." He noted that about 40 percent of the index is being driven by five companies: Amazon, Facebook, Netflix, Alphabet and Apple. "If we see a downturn in those names," the index could be in trouble. The Dow rose 232 points, closing just shy of the 21,000 level, with Caterpillar and McDonald's contributing the most gains. The S&P 500 advanced 0.6 percent, with financials and materials rising more than 1 percent to lead advancers. "I think we've come to believe that Q1 is soft because of some reason that economists or market analysts haven't been able to pinpoint," said Kim Forrest, senior equity analyst at Fort Pitt Capital. "That doesn't seem to be happening now." "Earnings thus far have been good," said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at First Standard Financial. "That's a good sign that Corporate America is on a renewed path toward growth." More than 190 S&P components are expected to have reported by the end of the week. Other big names scheduled to release quarterly results this week include Boeing, Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft and General Motors. The major U.S. stock indexes soared on Monday after the first round of the French presidential election went as most investors expected. Centrist Emmanuel Macron advanced to the runoff against far-right candidate Marine Le Pen. The runoff is scheduled for May 7. "I have to say I was surprised because what happened with Marine Le Pen is what we were expecting. So why get got a bump off that is interesting," said Maris Ogg, president at Tower Bridge Advisors. "But I think that removed a big cloud [over the market] and people are starting to focus on the fundamentals again." Nevertheless, investors also zeroed in on Washington, as President Donald Trump tried to avoid a government shutdown. Government funding will end Friday unless Congress can agree on at least a temporary funding resolution. The Trump administration is also expected to release an outline to potential tax reform later this week. Tax reform expectations have been one of the key market drivers since the presidential election. "Earnings and tax reform are the main story" in the market, said Bruce Bittles, chief investment strategist at Baird. "For two months, we were in a consolidation phase and now we have the Nasdaq at an all-time high." Overseas, European equities rose broadly, with the pan-European Stoxx 600 index 0.21 percent. In Asia, stocks closed mostly higher, with the Shanghai composite rising 0.16 percent and the Nikkei 225 advancing 1.08 percent. In economic news, U.S. home prices rose more than expected in February, according to new data from the S&P/Case-Shiller U.S. National Home Price Index. The national home price index jumped 5.8 percent in February, while analysts were expecting home prices to climb by 5.7 percent. New home sales rose 5.8 percent to 621,000 in March, above expectations. Consumer confidence held at 120.3 for April.  CNBC's Lauren Thomas contributed to this report.

"Following" : "Follow"}} April 25, 2017 1:06pm   Comments Share: Now that it seems to be a regular occurrence, traders don’t seem to be  paying too much attention to the potential government shutdown that could  occur if lawmakers can’t agree on plans to fund the federal government. Instead, more focus appears to be on global risks—even those seem like less of a focus following the latest round of French election results—and first-quarter earnings results. On the earnings front this week, airplane maker Boeing Co (NYSE: BA), American Airlines Group Inc (NASDAQ: AAL), and Southwest Airlines Co (NYSE: LUV) are reporting.   Boeing (BA) Earnings: Q1 Deliveries Down Big orders are generally indicative of demand and might be what grabs attention in the news, but deliveries are an important figure to watch because that’s what brings the money in. Earlier in the month, Boeing said its total first-quarter deliveries dropped to 169 from 176 a year ago. Deliveries for the 737 and 777 models as well as military aircraft fell, although the company did deliver two additional 787 Dreamliners. Boeing reports first-quarter earnings before market open on April 26 with expectations for earnings of $1.91 per share on revenue of $21.44 billion, according to consensus third-party analyst estimates. Those estimates project almost a 10% rise in earnings per share on a 2.7% decline in revenue. Boeing’s stock had a pretty nice run since the start of the year, increasing 16.94% year-to-date compared to just over a 6% gain for the S&P 500 (SPX), and hit an all-time high of $185.71 at the beginning of March. Still close to all-time highs, the options market has priced in almost a 2.5% potential stock move in either direction around the earnings release, according to the Market Maker Move indicator on the thinkorswim platform. In short-term options trading, calls at the 180 and 185 strike prices and puts at the 175 strike have been active. The implied volatility sits at the 38th percentile. Note: Call options represent the right, but not the obligation, to buy the underlying security at a predetermined price over a set period of time. Put options represent the right, but not the obligation to sell the underlying security at a predetermined price over a set period of time. AAL and LUV: Declining Earnings Ahead? The airlines industry is also in the spotlight for its estimated earnings decline this quarter. According to FactSet, earnings for the airline companies in the SPX are expected to decline 50%, the largest year-over-year decline out of all twelve industries in the industrials sector. What might be driving the expected weakness? Delta Air Lines, Inc. (NYSE: DAL) attributed it to higher fuel costs and foreign currency headwinds in its earnings press release earlier this month. Some analysts are expecting those same things to impact American Airlines and Southwest. American Airlines reports first-quarter earnings before market open on April 27 with expectations for earnings of $0.57 per share on revenue of $9.62 billion, according to consensus third-party analyst estimates. Southwest also reports first-quarter earnings before market open on April 27 with expectations for earnings of $0.62 per share on revenue of $4.89 billion, according to consensus third-party analyst estimates. Revenue estimates for both are up slightly compared to the same quarter a year ago while earnings estimates are down significantly. For American Airlines, the options market has priced in just over a 2% potential stock move in either direction around the earnings release, according to the Market Maker Move indicator on the thinkorswim platform. In short-term options trading, calls were active at the 45, 45.5 and 47 strike prices and puts were spread out across strikes. The implied volatility sits at the 14th percentile, the lower end of the range. Looking at Southwest, the options market has priced in just under a 4.5% potential stock move in either direction around the earnings release, according to the Market Maker Move indicator on the thinkorswim platform. In short-term options trading, there hasn’t been any real pattern to trading with some activity in puts at the 55 strike price. The implied volatility sits at the 55th percentile. It’s a packed earnings week that finishes off with major tech companies Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN), Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT), and Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC) reporting on Thursday. They’ll set the stage for Apple Inc.

Moon is ankling the stations to join her fiance, Alain Garcia, a former Navy fighter pilot who has been assigned to Kuwait City for the Boeing Co.    Moon's last day on the air will be May 12. She told station officials she plans to do freelance television work in the Middle East. A Florida native who plays the piano and the harp, Moon worked in Tampa and Washington before settling in St. Louis. In 2013, Moon was central to a social-media flap when she hugged Ryan Ferguson, upon his release from prison. Ferguson had served 10 years for the murder of a Columbia newspaper editor. Moon had covered the story for both KPLR and KTVI. Some media observers said her actions brought her objectivity into question.

In 2017, it's international buyback stocks that are on top, gaining 8.5 percent. Tim Mullaney, special to CNBC.com 17 Hours AgoCNBC.com SHARES Jabin Botsford | The Washington Post | Getty Images Donald Trump One of the ideas that seemed like a no-brainer in a Donald Trump-led stock market was to bet on a bigly benefit from stock buybacks. Analysts agree buybacks will blossom if the administration gets its way on corporate tax cuts. So how have domestic stock buyback funds done since Trump's election? Looking back, you wouldn't buy them. They've been laggards compared to a straight-up S&P 500 bet. The two exchange-traded funds whose strategy is to ride U.S.-based companies that buy back the highest percentage of their shares have risen less than the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index this year. The best buyback ETF, by far, is the one most divorced from U.S. tax policy: the $125 million PowerShares International Buyback Achievers Portfolio (IPKW), which is up 9 percent this year, according to Morningstar data through April 20, placing it way ahead of the U.S. buyback funds and also ahead of the global MSCI ACWI index. In general, overseas stocks have outperformed the U.S. market this year. John Feyerer, director of equity ETF product strategy at PowerShares, said IPKW may continue to benefit from ongoing quantitative easing in both the EU and Japan, which has served to strengthen corporate balance sheets and provide cash for buyback programs. Companies in Japan, in particular, have announced a record amount of buyback programs amidst an environment that has a continued focus on enhancing shareholder value. The ETF has nearly one-third of its weight in Japanese equities and an additional 25 percent of its weight in European equities. show chapters Things could be looking up for Japan    Tuesday, 18 Apr 2017 | 9:19 PM ET | 01:26 The biggest buyback ETF has done the worst: Invesco's $1.4 billion PowerShares Buyback Achievers Portfolio (PKW), including U.S. stocks, is up just 2.88 percent. The relatively small State Street's SPDR S&P 500 Buyback Achievers Fund (SPYB) is up 4.47 percent. That's despite projections by Goldman Sachs that big companies will spend as much as three-quarters of any gains from repatriating profits made outside the United States on buybacks. They spent repatriated gains on buybacks the last time Congress offered a tax holiday, even though it was technically prohibited, according to congressional research. More from Trading the World: Why millionaire investors don't care about Trump's time-traveling tax reform You may actually want to reject this investing advice from Bogle and Buffett Pick up in global growth concentrated on emerging markets: Economist "Mostly, this has been a wait-and-see trade," said David Nadig, CEO of ETF.com. "For traders I talk to, tax reform seems like such an uncertainty at this point that it's hard to bet on anything." There are three big reasons why Trump hasn't been able to boost the buyback bandwagon much, experts say. 1. The biggest holdings in buyback funds aren't the same companies that have the most offshore cash, and which are expected to benefit most if Trump's expected tax proposal becomes law. Buyback funds pick stocks that have bought back a lot of shares in the past, but companies like Apple and Microsoft, which are sitting on the most offshore cash, have not bought back a high enough percentage of their shares to be major holdings for buyback funds. Technology stocks have led the U.S. market this year. PowerShares Buyback Achievers Portfolio top holdings include Boeing, McDonalds, General Electric, Goldman Sachs, United Technologies, Gilead Sciences and American Express. The tech sector is less than 9 percent of the ETF, according to Morningstar, while financials and consumer cyclicals comprise roughly 50 percent. The five biggest winners under the repatriation provision of Trump's bill are expected to be Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Cisco Systems and Oracle, Moody's Investor Service estimated last fall. Not one of these stocks is among the top 25 holdings in PKW, according to Morningstar ETF holdings information. "Apple has done some buybacks, but not to the extent of a Boeing or a GE," Nadig said. He added that the move in buyback shares "won't be about the funds — it will be about the single-share plays" that will become big buyers of their own stock once the tax break is law. Although the ETF's methodology looks at the corporations that have bought back shares outstanding of 5 percent or more in the trailing 12-month period, the ruled-based approach serves investors well in that they are able to understand just how PKW will behave, Feyerer said. "It takes the emotional aspects out of shorter-term trends that may or may not prove beneficial." And until tax reform and cash repatriation become reality, "we think it's most prudent for investors to consider strategies that have proven value over time," he added. 2. The Trump tax bill may be arriving sooner than expected, but that comes after the administration tempered expectations. It's been a chaotic process that raises doubts about passage. For months the White House was saying a tax bill could be approved by summer. Then last week Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said the timeline was aggressive and unrealistic. But then Mnuchin reversed his position on April 20, saying tax reform would come very soon. The next day, Trump said tax reform would be unveiled this week and include the biggest tax cut ever. But Trump seemed to waver on the timing, with the White House issuing a subsequent statement, saying, "The president was saying what we've been saying all along, that he wants to do tax reform as quickly as possible while still doing it right." Trump is expected to present a broad framework for tax reform, but he has been insisting it include a 15 percent corporate tax rate even if that complicates deficit-reduction efforts. The biggest problem is that the White House wants to revive its failed health-care proposal in some form first. The savings from eliminating health-insurance subsidies for middle-class families and young workers who don't get coverage at work were expected to help pay for the tax-cut package, says C. C. Huang of the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities. Blackstone group chair Steve Schwarzman, who heads a Trump CEO advisory council, said on CNBC earlier this month that a new health-care bill will probably be considered before tax changes. "Some of these issues are tough, because the numbers don't work easily," he said. "On the tax side, I think it will be slower. People don't want to make a mistake.'' "For traders I talk to, tax reform seems like such an uncertainty at this point that it's hard to bet on anything." -David Nadig, CEO of ETF.com But prospects for Trump's health plan remain dubious, even in amended form, given the hard-to-reconcile split between the House Freedom Caucus, a group of about 15 staunch conservatives who wanted even deeper Medicaid cuts than in the failed bill, and a group of about 10 GOP moderates who wanted the exact opposite. When Mnuchin said last week that tax reform would not be delivered on Trump's original timeline (August), he cited the health-care bill failure among the reasons. On Monday the White House said a vote on a new health-care bill may not come for weeks. Assuming the health-care issue is resolved, the GOP is split deeply about how to cut taxes and whether it's important to restructure the code in a way that doesn't add to the budget deficit. In particular, Republicans from different parts of the country are split over whether to use import taxes on consumer goods to help pay for corporate tax cuts, a move vocally opposed by Republican Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas, whose state is home to Wal-Mart Stores' headquarters. "If I were an investor, I wouldn't be trying to model U.S. tax law a year from now," said Alex Bryan, director of passive strategies research at Morningstar. "It's too hard to have an edge.'' 3. Buybacks complement fundamentals; they don't replace them. Apple is a leading example here: Its prospects this year probably have been helped by the prospect of bigger buybacks but helped more by the looming prospect of 8th-generation iPhones, expected this fall. Industry mavens are high on the phone's rumored glass-and-stainless-steel body, wireless charging and other new features. Shares, up more than 20 percent year-to-date, have also been boosted by a recovery in sales growth in China. The lesson: Buybacks do often help stocks of well-run companies beat the market. PKW has outperformed the S&P 500 over the past 10 years. It has gained 8.4 percent per year since 2006, topping the 7.2 percent gain (sans dividends) for the S&P 500. But the hopes for a Trump bump adding to the normal case for buyback-focused investing has fizzled. — By Tim Mullaney, special to CNBC.com Related Securities Symbol Price   Change %Change AAPL --- More From Trading the World You may actually want to reject this investing advice from Bogle and Buffett Latest Special Reports Modern Medicine Take an in-depth look at the world of modern medicine - examining the treatments, companies and people making a difference in the way we treat illness and injuries today, and laying the foundation for the medical treatments of tomorrow.

The Dow jumped more than 200 points, briefly breaks back above 21,000. "Earnings and tax reform are the main story" in the market, says Baird's Bittles. Fred Imbert | @foimbert 10 Hours AgoCNBC.com SHARES show chapters Stocks surged on Tuesday    11 Hours Ago | 01:04 U.S. equities rose sharply on Tuesday as solid quarterly reports from several large-cap companies rolled through. The Nasdaq composite jumped about 0.7 percent, sending the index above 6,000 for this first time ever. "It's certainly a psychological factor," said Jeff Carbone, managing partner of Cornerstone Financial Partners. "It took us many years to get back above 5,000 and now we're at 6,000. But you've got to be careful." He noted that about 40 percent of the index is being driven by five companies: Amazon, Facebook, Netflix, Alphabet and Apple. "If we see a downturn in those names," the index could be in trouble. The Dow Jones industrial average rose about 230 points, with Caterpillar and McDonald's contributing the most gains and briefly broke above 21,000. The S&P 500 advanced 0.6 percent, with materials rising more than 1 percent to lead advancers. "I think we've come to believe that Q1 is soft because of some reason that economists or market analysts haven't been able to pinpoint," said Kim Forrest, senior equity analyst at Fort Pitt Capital. "That doesn't seem to be happening now." Here are some of the firms that posted quarterly results before the bell: Caterpillar: posted EPS of $1.28 and sales of $9.822 billion, versus expected EPS of 62 cents and $9.271 billion revenue forecast. McDonald's: posted EPS of $1.47 and revenue of $5.68 billion, versus expected EPS of $1.33 and sales of $5.53 billion. 3M: posted EPS of $2.16 and revenue of $7.685 billion, versus expected EPS of $2.06 and sales of $7.472 billion. DuPont: posted EPS of $1.64 and sales of $7.743 billion, versus expected EPS of $1.39 and revenue of $7.504 billion. "Earnings thus far have been good," said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at First Standard Financial. "That's a good sign that Corporate America is on a renewed path toward growth." More than 190 S&P components are expected to have reported by the end of the week. Other big names scheduled to release quarterly results this week include Boeing, Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft and General Motors. The major U.S. stock indexes soared on Monday after the first round of the French presidential election went as most investors expected. Centrist Emmanuel Macron advanced to the runoff against far-right candidate Marine Le Pen. The runoff is scheduled for May 7. Getty Images "I have to say I was surprised because what happened with Marine Le Pen is what we were expecting. So why get got a bump off that is interesting," said Maris Ogg, president at Tower Bridge Advisors. "But I think that removed a big cloud [over the market] and people are starting to focus on the fundamentals again." The Dow soared more than 200 points, while the S&P and Nasdaq climbed about 1 percent. Nevertheless, investors also zeroed in on Washington, as President Donald Trump tried to avoid a government shutdown. Government funding will end Friday unless Congress can agree on at least a temporary funding resolution. The Trump administration is also expected to release an outline to potential tax reform later this week. Tax reform expectations have been one of the key market drivers since the presidential election. "Earnings and tax reform are the main story" in the market, said Bruce Bittles, chief investment strategist at Baird. "For two months, we were in a consolidation phase and now we have the Nasdaq at an all-time high." Overseas, European equities rose broadly, with the pan-European Stoxx 600 index 0.21 percent. In Asia, stocks closed mostly higher, with the Shanghai composite rising 0.16 percent and the Nikkei 225 advancing 1.08 percent. In economic news, U.S. home prices rose more than expected in February, according to new data from the S&P/Case-Shiller U.S. National Home Price Index. The national home price index jumped 5.8 percent in February, while analysts were expecting home prices to climb by 5.7 percent.

Here, Stephen Mitchell, manager of the Jupiter Global Managed Fund, says Trump now needs to deliver on some of his promised tax and regulatory reforms to maintain positive momentum. The rally in global stock markets following the election of Donald Trump came about on expectations, so far largely unrealised, that his presidency would usher in a new era of low taxation, market deregulation and infrastructure spending that would boost US growth, with a positive knock-on effect for economies worldwide. Certainly, his election helped changed the mood among investors in the US, contributing to positive market sentiment and the so-called “Trump Bump”, but on the global economy, the 45th US President has also had his fair share of luck. Trump Gets Lucky With Market Rally Trump was elected just as the global markets were beginning to feel the beneficial effects of a renewed stimulus package put together by the Chinese authorities in early 2016 to boost an economy slowed by an anti-corruption drive. These stimulus measures have helped sustain growth both domestically and worldwide, alleviating concerns a Chinese slowdown would act as a drag on global GDP, and thus have been a helpful tailwind for Trump. The modest recovery in the price of oil has also been a boon to the US economy just as Trump took on the presidency. After spending the early part of 2016 hovering around the $30 a barrel mark, oil has now steadied around $50 a barrel, a price at which more US shale producers are able to operate oil rigs which has led to a rebound in industrial production. Thus, Trump has benefited from two helpful tailwinds in the early days of his presidency. That said, recent visits to Florida and Texas did uncover real support for Trump and his policies among the business community. This support has translated into surging levels of economic confidence among small businesses and rising consumer sentiment. Job creation and hiring seem to be holding up, with unemployment falling to 4.5% in March from 4.8% in October the month prior to his election. Trump, as one would perhaps expect from a businessman, has also been courting the country’s big corporations, setting up a Business Advisory Council to give seventeen chief executives from firms such as Pepsico (PEP), JP Morgan (JPM) and Boeing (BA) a platform where they can influence and shape business-friendly policies. Knowing these titans of US industry have the ear of the president, and are offering a guiding hand does offer some reassurance – he does appear to listen. Will the Market Fall as Reality Bites? Yet the “Trump Bump” shows signs of flagging as the three pillars on which the stock market rally has been built have looked increasingly shaky, with some questioning the gap between expectation and the new president’s ability to deliver on his promises. Talk has turned to a “Trump slump” as his failure to get his new healthcare bill passed raised questions about his ability to get other measures adopted. We believe this pessimism over delivery may be becoming overblown. In our view, Trump will have some marginal scope to deliver on tax, can make significant headway in the area of regulation, but is likely to disappoint on infrastructure. On Tax Reform Because the US has a relatively high corporate tax rate of 35%, many US companies choose not to repatriate profits they make from their overseas activities. It is estimated that the 500 largest US companies hold between $2.1 trillion and $2.5 trillion in cash overseas in order to avoid what they view as a punitive tax rate. Repatriation of this overseas cash has merits which are recognised across political parties which may ease its passage. A repatriation ‘tax holiday’ where companies are given a temporary window in which their overseas earnings are only taxed at a proposed 10% rate, could see a lot of money returning to the US which could be used for investment or mergers and acquisitions. It should, in our view, be possible to implement, in that it would not require budget cuts to be made elsewhere to change the law, and is thus a win-win for Trump’s “America First” policies. Other tax reforms, including cutting corporate tax to 20%, are likely to prove far more problematic. These tax cuts would have to be paid for by difficult budget cuts elsewhere, and with the country already $19 trillion in debt, appetite for such reforms may be limited. There is a significant cross-party movement to restrain America’s already high level of indebtedness, rather than increase it. On Infrastructure Spending Time is Trump’s greatest enemy here. It can take a minimum of five years to get work started on large infrastructure projects such as new highways, transport systems, bridges and airports. He may make announcements in this area but any positive benefit to the US economy is only likely to be felt long after Trump’s first (and possibly only) term. On Deregulation As for cutting red tape, many rules and regulations governing business come from regulatory bodies where Trump can directly make the key leadership appointments. The one caveat is that his administration has been slower than most in making those appointments. At a legislative level, Trump has had some modest success in his first 100 days; he managed to push through an internet privacy bill that will allow some companies to sell-on information on consumers’ internet habits to other firms who are then able to market goods and services to them. Unlike the passage of the healthcare bill, Trump should find a Republican-dominated Congress is amenable to a further loosening of the regulatory burden on US businesses, especially in the financial arena. How Has He Fared 100 Days In? For his first 100 days in office, Trump has managed to chalk up some modest achievements, but there remains much work to be done to satisfy expectations. Whereas he started his presidency with a few favourable tailwinds– Chinese stimulus, higher oil prices– he now faces a formidable headwind in the form of the US Federal Reserve. The US central bank seems determined to pursue its policy of raising interest rates closer to a neutral rate in 2017 amid concern over a tightening labour market and rising asset prices. Higher interest rates mean the average US consumer will see more of their income being used to service debt, with less money available for discretionary purchases. As a global equity manager, a slowing US economy would be of concern to me, as it would almost inevitably lead to a drop in US demand for global goods and services. The political calendar is a second potential headwind. Trump may only have 18 months to implement his key reforms on tax and regulation before mid-term elections due in November 2018 usher in a new Congress that would be potentially more hostile to the president’s policies. While such a deadline may seem daunting, Trump has shown an ability to adapt quickly to situations and to take counsel in order to achieve his goals. His first 100 days in office, while not an unqualified success, have demonstrated his unconventional approach is not always a barrier to policy implementation, and his flexibility in dealing with problems may turn out to be a strength.

It is projection/opinion and not a statement of fact. Morningstar assigns star ratings based on an analyst’s estimate of a stock's fair value. Four components drive the Star Rating: (1) our assessment of the firm’s economic moat, (2) our estimate of the stock’s fair value, (3) our uncertainty around that fair value estimate and (4) the current market price. This process culminates in a single-point star rating that is updated daily. A 5-star represents a belief that the stock is a good value at its current price; a 1-star stock isn't. If our base-case assumptions are true the market price will converge on our fair value estimate over time, generally within three years. Investments in securities are subject to market and other risks. Past performance of a security may or may not be sustained in future and is no indication of future performance.

Politico said on its website, Monday, that the U.S. plane manufacturer has added Lippert as vice president of international government affairs. An aide to former U.S. President Barack Obama, Lippert returned to the U.S on Jan. 20 after President Donald Trump ordered all politically appointed ambassadors to quit by his inauguration day. Beginning his ambassadorship in October 2014, Lippert, 44, was the youngest U.S. ambassador to Seoul. He was also the first U.S. envoy to have fathered children here. Lippert also tried to befriend as many Koreans as possible in person and on social media, which was a new approach compared to his predecessors. A diehard Korean baseball fan, Lippert visited Korea in late March to attend the Doosan Bears opening game in Seoul He was injured in a knife attack in March 2015, when Kim Ki-jong, an anti-U.S. activist, slashed his cheek and stabbed his left hand at a breakfast meeting in central Seoul.

On the campaign trail he excoriated Wall Street and pledged to “drain the swamp” of lobbyists. In office he has stuffed his cabinet full of gilded bankers and hidden the White House guest book so we will never find out who has his ear. Trump's 25 executive orders in 100 days: more cosmetic than substantive Read more He promised to slash environmental regulation (done), reassess the post-financial crash Dodd Frank financial regulations (doing) and to slash taxes on businesses (pending). All these things should be pro-business. “Business likes to follow the path of least resistance,” says Peter Henning, law professor and regulatory expert at Wayne State. “He campaigned as a populist president but I’d say that so far the banks sure like him.” But even more than tax cuts and deregulation, business likes certainty and here Trump’s first 100 days suggest business is out of luck. Trump is also arguably the US’s most protectionist president since Herbert Hoover, a view that may have got him elected but that sends the global elite of Davos into the horrors. Nor has the president been shy to name and shame those companies that offend him. Trump has used the bully pulpit (mostly via his Twitter account) to lambast companies including GM and Ford for their plans to manufacture overseas. He wiped $1bn, temporarily, off Boeing’s value after threatening to cancel its contract to build the new Air Force One 747. Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) General Motors is sending Mexican made model of Chevy Cruze to U.S. car dealers-tax free across border. Make in U.S.A.or pay big border tax! January 3, 2017 Even the Kochs, usually every Republican president’s favorite rightwing billionaires, aren’t happy with Trump’s tough talk on trade. The brothers recently financed ads attacking a “border adjustment tax” on goods coming into the US that Trump wants to use to build his “big, beautiful wall” to keep Mexicans out (you may remember it as the one Mexico was going to pay for). The Koch’s ads claim US shoppers will end up paying for that tax in higher prices at Walmart etc. But having got off to a galvanizing start, there are some signs that Wall Street is no longer glued to Trump’s every word. Repealing Obama rules is one thing Trump has done effectively, but drafting and passing his own – not so much. Talk of tax cuts last week did little for stock prices which rallied after his election (the Trump Bump), but peaked in March and have drifted down ever since. Elizabeth Warren (@SenWarren) .@realDonaldTrump .@realDonaldTrump’s actions in his first 100 days have shown his tough talk against Wall Street and big corporations was just that: all talk April 22, 2017 The administration’s humiliating defeat, at the hands of its own party, over its plans to repeal and replace Obamacare have shown the limits of his authority. When Trump came out in support of Bill O’Reilly, Fox News’s fallen idol, O’Reilly still lost his job. Already some business leaders, even those with terrible reputations (that’s you Uber’s Travis Kalanick) have dropped out of Trump’s business advisory council, lest their proximity be read as approval. Donald Trump's first 100 days as president – daily updates Read more Thanks to the supreme court, corporations are people too and as the fight for equal bathroom rights for transgender people in North Carolina has shown, corporations are increasingly more liberal in their views than the Trump administration. On issues such as the environment, women’s rights, immigration and the treatment of the LGBTQ community, it’s not hard to see companies increasingly siding with consumers and activists against the Trump administration (especially if the president’s poll numbers keep falling). But while the president may look less powerful 100 days on, business has not forgotten what Potus represents. Rihanna may have 71 million followers on Twitter compared with Trump’s 6.6m but she doesn’t have the nuclear codes. Foreign policy remains the great uncertainty as Trump exits his “honeymoon”. He has softened the rhetoric on China but is still insisting on his border wall, has bombed Syria and made worrying noises about North Korea. One hundred days in, business may be taking Trump a little less seriously at home – for now, overseas issues look more worrying. All that could change in a tweet. This is a president who likes surprises, and business hates surprises.

Toggle navigation Login Register RS Gathering Diaries × Toggle navigation Bill Nye Isn’t Really a Science Guy But He’ll Play One on TV to Push His Leftist Agenda Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Bill Nye Isn’t Really a Science Guy But He’ll Play One on TV to Push His Leftist Agenda Posted at 4:00 am on April 25, 2017 by Jim Jamitis Share on Facebook Share on Twitter There was a time when I was a big fan of Bill Nye’s. That was long before he became an authoritarian, supercilious fraud. Bill Nye is just another leftist celebrity promoting a leftist agenda. People need to stop looking to him as if he were an authority on…well…anything. Although he is not a scientist, Nye seldom if ever reminds the people that he’s speaking to that he is only a former engineer who decades ago jumped careers into entertainment. He parlayed a regional sketch comedy television gig into a successful children’s television show. He used that to gain access to real scientists and allows people to assume based on his proximity that he is one himself. In the early 1990s, Nye was a cast member on Almost Live, a local sketch comedy show that aired right before Saturday Night Live on a Seattle NBC affiliate. The “Bill Nye the Science Guy” character began—or at least appeared regularly—on Almost Live. Years later, after the Bill Nye the Science Guy television show had become a nationwide hit I was at a symposium on space exploration in Washington, D.C. Nye participated on a panel about science education with Don Herbert (aka Mr. Wizard). I got to meet Nye briefly afterward, but looking at what he has become, I actually regret being as excited as I was about the opportunity. At the time though I liked what he was doing on his show. Having an engineering degree myself, I loved seeing someone get kids interested in STEM subjects. The fame ultimately went to his head. Now he is just one of many celebrities who believe that by virtue of being famous, they are also authoritative. His delusion is made worse because to an army of millennials he is a cult hero who introduced them to science while they slurped overly sugared cereal in their pajamas. They’re the same people who think the clownish Neil DeGrasse Tyson is the second coming of Galileo. Nye has actually surpassed Tyson in the area of being an annoyingly condescending douche. That in itself is no small achievement. Lately, Nye is gunning for Chelsea Clinton’s spot in that hierarchy. Among climate jihadis, he probably now outranks Al Gore. His megalomania is evident even in the titles of his recent projects. He published a book in 2015 titled Unstoppable which naturally was well received by loony left Salon.com. As only Bill Nye can, he uses the book to explain the science behind climate change, debunks popular myths, and asks readers to take action in their own lives to create a sustainable future. The book is shot through with optimism, but Nye has no illusions about what lies ahead. The message is simple: Climate change is real; humans are causing it; and we have no choice but to build a better and cleaner world. As only Bill Nye (the actor/comedian with a B.S. in mechanical engineering) can… Salon referred to Nye as a scientist in their puff piece in 2015, but apparently Bill hasn’t had time to correct them. He told Salon what his goals were back then. My goal is to change the world! Really, that’s what I’m trying to do. Obviously, this book isn’t going to change the world, but it is part of the bigger idea that we all have to think optimistically about this. We’ve got to go into this knowing we have a hard challenge but that we’re going to win this fight, and we’re going to save the earth for humanity. As I like to say, you’re a human being no matter what you do. So we have to save the earth for us. Things are going to change; there’s going to be upheaval, but we have to deal with it as best we can. And that means getting to work! Uh huh. Nye is talented as a sugarcoated propagandist. It’s easy to imagine him in another place and time printing posters depicting happy people laboring for the motherland to the chagrin of top hat wearing capitalists. How do you respond to the recalcitrant skeptics, the ones who say, “OK, I acknowledge that the earth is heating up, and I understand why that’s a bad thing. However, we don’t really know what’s causing that. And we don’t really know to what degree humans are responsible.” Yes, we do! It’s human activity. It’s the burning of fossil fuels and the release of methane, a natural gas mostly from agriculture, but to a lesser extent from leakage, so-called fugitive gas from an oil field. But these are solvable problems. And the science is clear on that, right? Absolutely. We know exactly why the climate is changing — it’s human activity! Trust him. He worked for Boeing for a few years before becoming a TV star. He’s even qualified to tell television networks what opinions they should allow to be expressed. “I will say, much as I love CNN, you’re doing a disservice by having one climate change skeptic, and not 97 or 98 scientists or engineers concerned about climate change,” Nye said during an appearance on CNN’s “New Day.” Without a hint of irony he later said this. “If you suppress science, if you pretend that climate change isn’t a real problem, you will fall behind other countries that do invest in science – that do invest in basic research,” Nye said. Allowing skeptics to speak is “suppressing” science but CNN is duty bound to “suppress” skeptics who disagree with him. The totalitarian impulse in Bill is strong. Trending Bill Nye Isn't Really a Science Guy But He'll Play One on TV to Push His Leftist Agenda Jim Jamitis Nye makes ham handed attempts to speak to people where they are—while proving that he’s not especially bright. He tries to sell his climate change agenda by citing the Constitution and fails badly. The Daily Caller reported on this. “And it is interesting to note, I think, that Article 1 Section 8 of the U.S. Constitution refers to the progress of science and the useful arts,” Nye said. “Useful arts in 18th Century usage would be what we call engineering or city planning or architecture,” Nye said. He made similar statements to Vox, where I assume they needed a mop to soak up the fanboy drool. Unsurprisingly nobody Voxplained why he was horribly wrong. Article 1 Section 8 isn’t about federally funded science projects. It reads: “To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries.” The Copyright Clause has nothing to do with government-funded science, but everything to do with establishing a legal framework to protect intellectual property rights. It’s difficult to believe that he only read half the Copyright Clause, so he’s either just parroting something an underling wrote up for him or he’s being deliberately deceptive. Now he’s gone from being “unstoppable” to literally saving (not just changing) the world, at least according to his new Netflix series which is literally called Bill Nye Saves the World. The first step in saving the world is apparently promoting the current unscientific fad of inventing new genders and modes of sexuality. (Language warning. NSFW.) Bill Nye says this performance sends “exactly the right message.” (By the way, this show is only rated TV-14 for you parents of young teenagers.) The promising thing is that the ratings on YouTube for this clip are overwhelmingly negative as was also reported at The Daily Caller. Actually, even some outlets that you might expect to be totally in the tank for Bill Nye aren’t exactly giving the show rave reviews. Gizmodo is part of the Gawker family of sites, which means they may write about non-political things, but if politics comes into the story, you can usually count on it coming in from stage left if you know what I mean and I think you do. But here’s how Gizmodo introduced Bill Nye Saves the World: If you’re skeptical about human-caused climate change or the safety of vaccines, would being berated in front of a live studio audience by a bombastic old man make you change your mind? Then congratulations, Bill Nye’s new Netflix show, Bill Nye Saves The World, is literally just for you! Wait…where’d you go, bud? I was excited when I heard that a new science show for adults was hitting Netflix, especially one starring ‘90s-kid nerd hero Bill Nye. But either the science guy’s jokes haven’t aged well or his schtick—a zany dad-figure in a lab coat stirring beakers full of colored liquids—doesn’t quite work when he’s bellowing, red-faced, about the dangers of climate change denial, alternative medicine, and the anti-vaxxer movement. While seemingly aimed at the average layman who holds some science-skeptical views, Nye’s new show delivers so little information in such a patronizing tone it’s hard to imagine a toddler, let alone a sentient adult, enjoying it. Hopefully no one is letting their toddler watch Bill Nye grooving to Rachel Bloom singing about her sex junk, but point taken. This, unfortunately, is quintessential of the show—a small amount of information packaged to promote a cartoon-caricature understanding of a complex science issue, slanted to the POV of an unabashedly political science comedian. And there is why the left treats Bill Nye like an expert. That is exactly how the left packages virtually every issue for people. It’s why no one can disagree with leftists without being accused of hate. Nye does the same thing but he specializes in accusing people of being anti-science which is just a specific kind of hate. Look, I know you may have fond memories of a funny guy on television showing you how to make baking soda rockets or do cool tricks using dry ice. It may well have inspired you to enter a scientific or technical career. That’s great, but you need to know that Bill Nye the Science Guy is a fictional television character. The guy who invented the character is just another political talking head with an agenda. The real Bill Nye is to science what Bernie Sanders is to economics. He is no more an expert on climate change than Jenny McCarthy is on vaccines. I don’t believe Bill Nye should be silenced or prevented from expressing his opinions. He probably wouldn’t say the same for me since I’m skeptical about his dogmatic pronouncements about the cause of climate change. What I believe is that people should be fully informed about the credentials, qualifications, and backgrounds of people the media presents to us as experts. Treating Bill Nye as if he is a real life “science guy” confers upon him an authority and a perceived objectivity that he has not earned and Nye himself is abusing the trust of people who confuse him with an actual scientist.

Forbes, jforbes@post-dispatch.com CAMDENTON, Mo. • In a rural central Missouri town of 3,600 people, teenagers are making robotics as cool as football. Those teens include Catherine Sauer, 18, who is working on programming robots to see by themselves — something many college students don’t learn how to do. Eli Mangone, 16, welds aluminum — which is one of the hardest metals to precisely weld without warping — into the frames of robots. Josh Harmon, 16, uses software to design a more than 100-pound robot based on his team’s priorities for speed, sturdiness and function. “Once I got involved, I saw that it’s really cool,” Catherine said. “It’s outside of the classroom, so it’s not just like homework and the boring stuff that you have to learn in a textbook… In robotics, it’s not word problems. It’s an actual application.” Catherine, Eli and Josh are members of the LASER 3284 robotics team — not club, the students stress — at Camdenton High School, the single high school in a rural school system of 4,200 students that covers 350 square miles around Lake of the Ozarks. For a long time, the district’s greatest renown was its football program, which has won five state championships. Now, the district has arguably become a Missouri capital of youth robotics. And it has done so without many of the advantages of affluent suburban schools, many of which enjoy high-dollar support from nearby corporations. On Wednesday, LASER 3284 will join 17 Missouri high school teams and hundreds of others from around the world in St. Louis for the annual FIRST robotics championship. “All school districts are known for something,” said Camdenton Superintendent Tim Hadfield. “This has been one of the things we’ve wanted to hang our hats on.” Robotics is in such high demand here that the schools have to hold lotteries for spots on elementary teams. Almost 300 students were turned away just this year. One in 14 students districtwide is somehow involved with the after-school robotics program. Founded in 2009, Camdenton’s robotics program is one of the fastest-growing in the country. The district has more robotics coaches than football coaches. The high school team brings in awards from regional competitions and thousands of dollars in prize money and sponsorship year after year. The high school students’ level of engineering skill puts the education of many adults to shame. This month, when the high school team returned victorious from a competition, the school held a balloon launch to celebrate — just like it does with the football team, after-school activities director Sherry Comer pointed out with delight. “Last summer, I was reading an editorial in the newspaper,” said robotics coach Mitch Comer. “I knew we had done something when they said, when they hear Camdenton, they think of our robotics and football.” Homegrown success +11  Lucas Mosher, 16, looks at the robotics model the younger elementary students were making in the after school program.

Photo by J.B. Forbes, jforbes@post-dispatch.com J.B. Forbes Camdenton’s robotics program began when Comer, a technology teacher at Camdenton High who was born and raised in rural Missouri, attended a conference in Kansas City. He heard other educators talking about their robotics teams and the big sponsorships they enjoyed from places such as the Kansas City-based Kauffman Foundation that were right in their backyards. The resources they had, which are often harder to procure for rural schools, inspired Comer. He became determined to bring an opportunity like that to his own students in Camdenton, which sits hundreds of miles from major companies such as Boeing. For Comer, a school robotics program also signified a kind of personal redemption. When he was in high school, he dropped out of geometry class because his teacher couldn’t show him how the math he was learning applied to the real world. It’s a regret he still can’t shake today. “I don’t want the kids to make the same mistake I did,” he said. He and Sherry Comer, his wife, built a robotics program for Camdenton together. One problem was funding: being too far away from major companies and nonprofits based in the cities, they didn’t qualify for many grants or sponsorships. The first grant came to them from J.C. Penney for $10,000. Later, they no longer qualified for the grant because they were located too far from a store, Mitch Comer said. But their students went door to door looking for sponsors, asking the local chamber of commerce, the local Optimist Club, car dealerships and more. Sherry Comer secured federal after-school activity grants. They found a few professional engineering mentors — a key part of a robotics team’s success — at a small firm in Lake of the Ozarks. Now, the program is largely funded by sponsorships that the students procure themselves, including one from a company in Japan and one from Boeing. On top of that, the district has embraced robotics, allocating more than $100,000 to the program this school year. The program has grown from its first class of 21 students to more than 250.

Forbes Camdenton’s team is organized through FIRST, which was founded in 1989 by engineer and businessman Dean Kamen. Kamen set out to start not just an organization but a movement, one that would turn robotics into a sport as revered and respected as football and basketball. FIRST stands for “For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology,” “Our society just doesn’t celebrate the great minds,” Mitch Comer said. “We celebrate people who can sing and dance and play sports. But our true heroes are the ones who are going to solve cancer and global warming. We’re trying to change that culture … because math and science holds all the world’s problems.” While school officials across the state are rushing to adopt science, technology, engineering and math — or STEM for short — curricula and programs to make their schools more attractive and competitive, students and staff have invested much time and energy into Camdenton’s robotics program. And that careful investment produced an impressive track record. +11  Emily Haas, 9; and Kassee Westhoff, 9, work on their team's lego model.

Forbes About 92 percent of its students go on to either study STEM at a university or go directly to work in a STEM field. LASER 3284 has sent alumni to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, California Institute of Technology, Missouri University of Science and Technology and Stanford University. At least one current student is headed to MIT this fall. By the time they graduate, the students don’t just learn how to build robots, but how to run their own company, speak in front of an audience and work in a team. The students make their own presentations to prospective sponsors and to judges at robotics competitions. LASER 3284 students have also helped to start 65 FIRST teams in other schools. They organize and host robotics competitions, programming camps and workshops for coaches. They even lend their practice robots to other Missouri teams who don’t have the resources or expertise to build one on their own. This outreach work won LASER 3284 the prestigious FIRST Chairman’s Award this year. “It’s definitely a huge part of my life,” said LASER 3284 team member Melissa Stout, 16. “I’ve learned a lot from being involved about leadership and about different skills that you necessarily wouldn’t expect students to learn in a robotics program.” 3 O'clock Stir e-newsletter 3 O'clock Stir from the St. Louis Post-Dispatch Shake off your afternoon slump with the offbeat or overlooked news of the day.

Rodger Mallison rmallison@star-telegram.com Business April 25, 2017 11:44 AM Lockheed Martin shares drop as profits disappoint Wall Street Staff and wire reports LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story Lockheed Martin lowered its earnings forecast for 2017 after its first-quarter profit missed analysts’ estimates for only the third time this decade despite increased sales and profit in the Fort Worth-based aeronautics division. The first-quarter results were clipped by $184 million in charges related to international sales and investments, Lockheed said in a statement Tuesday. The biggest drag came from an $120 million charge recorded by the company’s rotary and missions systems unit to design, integrate and install an air missile defense system for an international customer. Aeronautics sales, bolstered by the F-35 program, increased 8 percent to $4.11 billion as Lockheed delivered 15 fighter jets in the quarter. Aeronautics division profit grew by 4 percent to $436 million. Overall, first-quarter earnings from continuing operations were $2.61 a share, Lockheed said, lagging the $2.79 average of analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Net sales of $11.1 billion were less than the $11.2 billion expected by analysts. The results caught investors off guard for a second consecutive quarter, sending shares down the most since the Bethesda, Md.-based company reported earnings in January. Shares (ticker: LMT) dropped $6.19 a share, or more than 2 percent, to $270.02. Lockheed predicted earnings this year will be $12.15 to $12.45 a share, 10 cents less than it had forecast in January. Analysts had estimated $12.59 a share. Investors have wondered whether the defense company will be able to maintain margins for the F-35, its largest source of income, with President Donald Trump fixated on the program’s expense. Trump criticized the jet’s costs as “out of control” late last year and suggested an upgrade of Boeing’s Super Hornet as a possible replacement for some Navy models of the F-35, prompting a review by U.S. Defense Secretary James Mattis. Adding to the concerns: Bloomberg News reported Tuesday that the Pentagon’s contract management agency estimates that the company will actually deliver nine fewer Joint Strike Fighters than the company’s current forecast of 66 planes. Lockheed hammered out an overall agreement for the F-35’s ninth, 10th and 11th production batches during extended negotiations with the Pentagon, Chief Executive Officer Marillyn Hewson told analysts Tuesday. The company agreed to drop its challenge to contract terms imposed by the Defense Department and gained improved cash payment terms for all three lots. The company expects to conclude talks for the 11th and largest batch of F-35s during the third quarter. This article includes material from Bloomberg News and the Star-Telegram archives.

REUTERS/Louis Nastro/File Photo    Competition And The “Open Skies Agreement” Neil Siefring Vice President, Hilltop Advocacy 8:16 PM 04/25/2017      Pinterest  Reddit  LinkedIn  WhatsApp     Share         TOP 5615824 Over the last few weeks, the news has been full of stories of domestic airlines treating their passengers poorly. Increasingly, antiquated airlines are treating their passengers like obstacles instead of paying customers who deserve respect. It is no surprise that legacy airlines are joining forces to restrict the options available to flyers by going after Open Skies agreements that give flyers flexibility. United, Delta, and American Airlines, are working to overturn Open Skies agreements, which have saved passengers billions of dollars in fares, into a way to weaken their competitors. Open Skies agreements have helped improve aviation across the globe for passengers and cargo flights, these agreements between countries have helped make aviation more predictable, and price responsive, benefiting the consumer. They may be in danger because aged airlines are feeling the impact of competition from other airlines. The push to revisit some of these agreements is being led by older, legacy carriers United, Delta, and American Airlines. Their more consumer friendly and innovative  competitors, including JetBlue, don’t support them, and the airline industry’s top trade association isn’t backing them, either. The old three airlines are using Open Skies to harm competing airlines. This move could easily harm all U.S. airlines if other countries responded in kind. This dinosaur triumvirate is pulling out all the stops to demonize smaller airlines who oppose them, and the travel industry, that represents a much broader set of interests than just airlines. Despite record profits in the past several years, the airline industry’s dinosaurs are asking the federal government to intervene against several airlines based in the United Arab Emirates and Qatar, purportedly because they are subsidized. The airlines — Emirates, Qatar Airways, and Etihad Airways — deny they are subsidized. It is curious that these three U.S. airlines are complaining about subsidies. The U.S. federal government has stepped in over the years to keep the U.S. legacy carriers from keeling over, through assuming billions of dollars in pension obligations to issuing stabilization grants. While U.S. carriers take money from the federal government, Middle Eastern airlines create thousands of American jobs by, among other things, buying Boeing airplanes. The collection of older carriers are afraid of competition, while JetBlue, Hawaiian, FedEx and Alaska all oppose the bid. That these are the innovative and customer friendly airlines is hardly a surprise. Airlines for America, the leading industry trade association, has declined to back the older airlines in their anti-competitive zeal. They are standing against American labor unions that want to prevent new airlines from being created. The unions have gone so far as to call for the repeal of a 2012 law that required airlines to disclose hidden fees in ticket prices. The airline cartel and their fellow travelers really don’t like competition and innovation. Perhaps they are trying to avoid competition because their product is inferior. Skytrax, a leading authority on air travel service ranked Delta at 35 in the world’s top 100 airlines. That looks good compared to United, which came in at 68 (two spots better than Azerbaijan Airlines) and American Airlines at 77 (one spot behind Ethiopian Airlines). It is no surprize that two of the Middle Eastern airlines the three legacy carriers are trying to harm by altering Open Skies finished first and second respectively in the rankings: Emirates and Qatar. Etihad came in at a very respectable sixth place. United, Delta, and American Airlines are being dragged kicking and screaming into the innovative economy. The next time you are stuck on hold with one of these legacy carriers, get bumped from a flight, or suffer through poor customer service, remember they are trying to fight Open Skies to limit your horizons.They should be working to improving service, not to stifle their competitors.

There was some trepidation that the plan, touted by President Donald Trump as "massive," could be a letdown after hyped-up expectations. Stocks soared Tuesday and bond yields rose ahead of the tax plan and as it appeared Congress will act on the budget in time to avoid a shutdown of the government later this week. "I don't think much of the move is related to renewed optimism over the tax plan," said Mark Cabana, head of U.S. short-rate strategy at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. "There's still an expectation that there's a long way to go on this plan. "We expect to see essentially the outlines of the broad strokes they would like to have, but not too much details," he said. "That leaves a lot of room for negotiation that will be needed between the White House and Congress." But earnings alone won't carry the market, and if there are a few big misses in the mix, it could trigger profit-taking. "It will only take disappointment from one or two household names to tip over the apple cart," said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Wunderlich Securities. He said the tax plan should be neutral unless it is not received well or there is some new feature the market views as negative. "It wouldn't take much commentary from the deficit hawks to say it's not passable," said Hogan. "It just feels like after two powerful rallies we're due for a reset." Yuri Gripas | Reuters Donald Trump Tax man When Trump unveils his tax plan, it is expected to sound familiar. Early indications suggest it will be much like the plan he introduced during the campaign, with a 15 percent corporate tax rate. There are not expected to be any new revenue-generating schemes, so bond market traders who have been talking about how it could swell the deficit will continue to focus on that. "Trump is pivoting away from the concept of deficit-neutral tax reform towards deficit-financed tax cuts. Trump is keeping his original plan of a 15 percent corporate tax rate, which is just a marker," wrote Dan Clifton, head of policy research at Strategas. Clifton said Trump may not have specifics on deductions, but he will be clear on lowering the effective corporate tax rate. Clifton expects, at the end of the day, that the corporate tax rate could fall from 35 percent to somewhere between 23 and 27 percent. The House plan currently proposes a 20 percent rate but includes a controversial Border Adjustment Tax, which would raise $1 trillion in revenues over 10 years. But the White House is not expected to embrace that plan, and traders believe it will rely instead on economic growth generating more tax revenues to pay for the tax cuts. Krishna Memani, CIO of OppenheimerFunds, said it will take a deficit-widening plan to charge up growth. "He can have policies that can improve the regulatory environment and cut tax rates, but the likelihood that it will jump-start the economy and get the growth rate to 3 percent ... for that the deficit has to widen. A tax plan where everything is paid for will not do it. ... The trend [growth] rate is 2 percent, and to jump-start that you need some new driver," Memani said. Powerful punch Earnings news has been packing a punch, and stocks were firing on all cylinders Tuesday, with big moves up in several big Dow components — Caterpillar, 3M, McDonald's, and Dupont. After the bell, movers included U.S. Steel, down nearly 20 percent on a big miss, and Chipotle, up 6 percent on better earnings. As of Tuesday morning, S&P 500 companies had beat earnings estimates at a pace of 78 percent. Earnings growth, including actual reports and estimates, was coming in at about 11.4 percent so far, over last year's first quarter, according to Thomson Reuters. The Nasdaq surged above 6,000 for the first time, and the S&P 500 rose 14 points to 2,388, 7 points shy of its record close. The Dow was up 232, or 1.1 percent, to 20,996. On Wednesday, Boeing, Procter and Gamble, Pepsico, Anthem, Norfolk Southern, United Technologies, Fiat Chrysler, Daimler, GlaxoSmithKline, Twitter and General Dynamics all report before the bell. Amgen, PayPal, F5 Networks, Fortune Brands and Tractor Supply are among those reporting after the market close. "Earnings have been pretty good, and given the growth environment, earnings expectations will probably get realized for at least the first half of 2017. There is a bit of risk the U.S. may be rolling over," but that won't be clear for awhile, Oppenheimer's Memani said. Oil inventories Oil could be a factor Wednesday, after a surprise jump in oil supply showed up in the American Petroleum Institute inventories report after the closing bell Tuesday. U.S. government data on inventories is reported at 10:30 a.m. ET. Stock traders have been eyeing oil prices, which have been sliding recently. West Texas Intermediate futures have been trading below $50 per barrel, a key technical area and a psychological level important for shale drillers. API reported a surprise 900,000 increase in crude inventories in the last week. WTI futures fell slightly, to just below $49.50 per barrel. But there was a shocking increase in gasoline inventories of 4.4 million barrels, suggesting that gasoline demand remains weak. "I'd say it remains lackluster but refiners are cranking out high volumes of supply," said John Kilduff of Again Capital. "If we get confirmation of these numbers, we'll have another leg lower," Kilduff said. "This could be another catalyst, particularly if gasoline leads the way down. It's the commodity in the complex that you look to see either supporting them or undermining them." Platts says analysts expect a drop in crude stocks of 1 million barrels when the Energy Information Administration report is released and a decline in gasoline supply of 1.1 million barrels. Distillates, which include diesel, are expected to fall 1.8 million barrels. Stock traders have been nervously eyeing crude, but it has not held back the stock market this week. "For global growth, even if the U.S. slows down, what oil prices are telling you is that emerging market growth may be slowing down," said Memani. "That would be really bad news since that was the driver of the entire trade from the second quarter of 2016." But he said he expects that oil is in a trading range as long as emerging market growth does not slow down meaningfully. "I don't think it's correcting," he said. "We'll be fretting about it without panicking." Patti DommCNBC Markets Editor

Tritten | Apr 25, 2017, 5:12 PM Share on Twitter Share on Facebook Email this article Share on LinkedIn The scheduled launch from Vandenberg Air Force base is meant to demonstrate U.S. nuclear capabilities, the Air Force said. (AP Photo/Lee Jin-man, File) The Air Force will test launch a Minuteman III, the country's nuclear-tipped intercontinental ballistic missile, from California on Wednesday. The scheduled launch from Vandenberg Air Force base is meant to demonstrate U.S. nuclear capabilities, the Air Force said, and comes as tensions are flaring over North Korea's recent missile tests. However, a spokeswoman for Air Force Global Strike Command, which is overseeing the test, said the launch was planned about a year in advance and had no connection to the provocations by Kim Jong Un's regime. The last Minuteman III test was in February, and they happen about four times a year. "These Minuteman launches are essential to verify the status of our national nuclear force and to demonstrate our national nuclear capabilities," Col. John Moss, the 30th Space Wing commander who will order the launch, said in a statement. The land-based Minuteman III can be launched from silos inside the United States. It forms the "backbone of the nuclear deterrence triad," according to Boeing, the defense contractor that makes the missiles. Despite the Air Force's comments, the launch is likely to be seen as a statement to the North Koreans as they appear to test U.S. resolve to stop their nuclear program, which could soon result in missiles capable of striking the West Coast. The Trump administration recently announced the USS Carl Vinson carrier strike group would steam to the Korean peninsula as a show of force, and a U.S. submarine equipped with cruise missiles has also deployed to the area.

REUTERS/Regis Duvignau By Cyril Altmeyer and Tim Hepher | PARIS PARIS French engine maker Safran (SAF.PA) reported higher-than-expected first-quarter revenue on Tuesday, buoyed by aerospace services, and told investors it was pushing ahead with plans to increase production of its LEAP civil jet engine. Safran confirmed its 2017 outlook and said its adjusted revenue rose 5.5 percent to 3.982 billion euros ($4.36 billion). It also said it continued to hold merger talks with French seats maker Zodiac Aerospace, after outlining an agreed offer in January, but declined to discuss how they were going or how it might go ahead with the two-pronged bid and merger plan. Zodiac said on April 14 it would delay publication of its half-year results by a week from April 20, saying it had too much on its plate due to the talks. Reuters reported this month that Safran is exploring plans to lower its $9 billion bid for Zodiac Aerospace (ZODC.PA) and may simplify its structure amid continued turmoil at the seats maker and pressure from its own shareholders. British hedge fund TCI renewed criticism of the deal on Tuesday, saying Safran should suspend the talks pending an audit. Safran Chief Executive Philippe Petitcolin said the company was "not distracted by this or that investor which chooses to express itself publicly". Despite doubts raised by some investors over its plans to buy Zodiac, Safran shares have risen since the talks began. Jefferies analyst Sandy Morris said this may be explained by a relatively trouble-free launch so far of the LEAP engine, co-produced with General Electric in the CFM International venture, as well as mishaps affecting rival engine maker Pratt & Whitney. CFM still faces a major hurdle in executing plans for LEAP engine deliveries this year but there have been few problems so far and the first Boeing 737 MAX is on time, he wrote in a note. Deliveries of Pratt & Whitney's engines, which compete with LEAP on the Airbus A320neo, have been slowed by various snags. One expert said as many as 72 Pratt engines have been taken off wing for inspection or repairs since entering service. As of mid-April, industry sources say Airbus had delivered a total of 100 A320neo aircraft since the fuel-efficient plane entered service in January 2016, including 53 fitted with Pratt & Whitney engines and the rest with CFM's LEAP engines. CFM's shareholders have said they could deliver 450 to 500 LEAP engines this year instead of 500 stated earlier. Petitcolin reaffirmed that CFM would be interested in a possible new twin-aisle, mid-market plane being studied by Boeing.

BUDGET Lockheed CEO 'hopeful' over budget resolution before Friday deadline By Ross Wilkers Apr 25, 2017 Media reports last night indicated President Donald Trump may be willing to wait until this September or even longer to seek federal funds for his border wall in a move that could help avert a government shutdown and move a spending bill through Congress by 11:59 p.m. Friday. Against that backdrop, Lockheed Martin CEO Marillyn Hewson told investors in the company’s first quarter earnings call Tuesday she is “hopeful” ongoing lawmaker discussions will result in the passage of a fiscal year 2017 defense spending bill. “We continue to urge our country’s leadership to reach an agreement,” Hewson said. The Defense Department is operating on a continuing resolution passed in December that sets its 2017 budget at the prior year’s level. House lawmakers passed a $578 billion 2017 defense spending bill in March and the Pentagon also wants an added $30 billion amendment to that. President Donald Trump proposed a $54 billion boost to defense spending in his fiscal 2018 budget blueprint and also seeks a $30 billion supplemental package for DoD. The 2018 “skinny budget” proposal has spending levels over the cap mandated by the Budget Control Act. Hewson told investors she was “pleased to see” the higher amounts in both the supplemental and 2018 budget outlines. She also referenced discussions at the February Munich International Security Conference that centered around an “increasingly more volatile” global environment. “Recent events around the world have only served to confirm this sentiment,” Hewson said. “We as a nation, need to recognize these threats and provide our military leaders relief from current budgetary constraints and allow them to address challenges in defense of our country and citizens. “We remain hopeful that progress will continue to be made in this area and upcoming legislation will include the increases necessary to equip and maintain our fighting forces.” Hewson noted the defense spending bill passed by the House includes money for additional F-35 fighter jets and Black Hawk helicopters. Lockheed’s first quarter call with investors is the first in a series of earnings statements and subsequent conferences with large government contractors this week that coincides with the current CR’s expiration. Wednesday’s schedule includes financial statements and calls with Boeing, General Dynamics and Northrop Grumman. Raytheon and L3 Technologies will follow on Thursday. On the financial front, shares in Lockheed traded almost 3 percent lower to $268.59 as of mid-afternoon as investors appeared spooked over $184 million in charges on the company’s first quarter earnings statement related to an international air missile defense program and an international joint venture. Both charges took $114 million off of first quarter profit, which came in at $763 million. On a per share basis, first quarter earnings were $2.61 with the charges versus Wall Street’s $2.79 consensus forecast with sales of $11.06 billion also short of analysts’ $11.13 billion. Lockheed cut full-year earnings guidance to $12.15-$12.45 per share versus the prior $12.25-$12.55 range. The company lifted its sales forecast to $49.5-$50.7 billion versus the prior $49.4 billion-$50.6 billion range. About the Author Ross Wilkers is a senior staff writer for Washington Technology.

Economy Federal Reserve Capitol Report Economic Report Columns Darrell Delamaide Irwin Kellner Rex Nutting Tools Economic Calendar Real Estate Location Scouts realtor.com My MarketWatch Watchlist Alerts Games Log In Home Industries Investing/Securities A big chunk of the Dow’s gains have come from earnings By Tomi Kilgore Published: Apr 25, 2017 4:53 p.m. ET Share Half the Dow components have reported results, with those stocks contributing about a third of the Dow’s gains littleny / Shutterstock.com Earnings are doing the heavy lifting for the Dow industrials By TomiKilgore Reporter and editor Investors can thank earnings, as much as they can anything else, for the Dow Jones Industrial Average’s rally over the last couple of weeks. The surge this week in the Dow DJIA, +1.12% which posted the first back-to-back 200+-point gains since the two days following the U.S. election, is being attributed by many to the reduced risk of euro dissolution in the wake of French election results and hopes for corporate tax cuts and a budget deal. But there is a lot more to it than that. Since April 13, when J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. JPM, +0.87%  kicked off first-quarter earnings reporting season before the market opened, 15 of the Dow’s 30 components have reported results through Tuesday morning, with 11 beating earnings expectations, according to FactSet. That 73% beat rate is above the 5-year average of 68% for S&P 500 index SPX, +0.61%  companies, FactSet said. More important, the shares of the Dow companies that have revealed results have gained a combined total of $20.69 in price since the reports were released through Tuesday, with 10 winners rising a combined $35.87 and five losers falling $15.01. The combined price gains added about 142 points to the Dow, which is a price-weighted index. That would represent about 35% of the Dow’s 404-point gain since earnings season started. Most of those earnings-related gains have come on Tuesday alone. The stocks of the five Dow companies that reported results added a combined 128 points to the Dow’s price, or more than half of the Dow’s 232-point rally. The biggest contributors were shares of Caterpillar Inc. CAT, +7.86% which added 52 points, and McDonald’s Corp. MCD, +5.57% which added about 51 points. Some Dow members scheduled to report earnings later this week include United Technologies Corp. UTX, +0.47% Boeing Co. BA, +0.80%  and Procter & Gamble Co. PG, +0.50%  on Wednesday; Microsoft Corp. MSFT, +0.58% Intel Corp. INTC, +0.33%  and Pfizer Inc. PFE, +0.06%  on Thursday; and Chevron Corp. CVX, +0.76%  and Exxon Mobil Corp. XOM, +0.76%  on Friday.

The surge this week in the Dow DJIA, +1.12% which posted the first back-to-back 200+-point gains since the two days following the U.S. election, is being attributed by many to the reduced risk of euro dissolution in the wake of French election results and hopes for corporate tax cuts and a budget deal. But there is a lot more to it than that. Since April 13, when J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. JPM, +0.87%  kicked off first-quarter earnings reporting season before the market opened, 15 of the Dow’s 30 components have reported results through Tuesday morning, with 11 beating earnings expectations, according to FactSet. That 73% beat rate is above the 5-year average of 68% for S&P 500 index SPX, +0.61%  companies, FactSet said. More important, the shares of the Dow companies that have revealed results have gained a combined total of $20.69 in price since the reports were released through Tuesday, with 10 winners rising a combined $35.87 and five losers falling $15.01. The combined price gains added about 142 points to the Dow, which is a price-weighted index. That would represent about 35% of the Dow’s 404-point gain since earnings season started. Most of those earnings-related gains have come on Tuesday alone. The stocks of the five Dow companies that reported results added a combined 128 points to the Dow’s price, or more than half of the Dow’s 232-point rally. The biggest contributors were shares of Caterpillar Inc. CAT, +7.86% which added 52 points, and McDonald’s Corp. MCD, +5.57% which added about 51 points. Some Dow members scheduled to report earnings later this week include United Technologies Corp. UTX, +0.47% Boeing Co. BA, +0.80%  and Procter & Gamble Co. PG, +0.50%  on Wednesday; Microsoft Corp. MSFT, +0.58% Intel Corp. INTC, +0.33%  and Pfizer Inc. PFE, +0.06%  on Thursday; and Chevron Corp. CVX, +0.76%  and Exxon Mobil Corp. XOM, +0.76%  on Friday.

By Danny Vinik 04/25/17 01:24 PM EDT Facebook Twitter Google + Email Print Heading into the 100th day of Donald Trump's presidency, the leader who promised to overhaul American tax policy hasn't named anyone to fill the top tax job in Washington. After promising a shake up of government hiring, he still has an empty slot for Washington's head of personnel. And as he takes on a rollback of Barack Obama's regulatory state, he hasn't submitted his nomination for the nation's regulatory czar. Trump's government so far is as notable for who it's missing as for what it has done. The gaps making headlines are his empty cabinet posts—former presidents Bush and Obama both had their cabinets filled by the 100th day of their presidencies, while Trump still doesn't have a confirmed labor secretary or U.S. trade representative, and added his agriculture secretary only on day 95. But when it comes to the real functioning of government, there are a host of crucial lower-profile jobs that are not only still empty but have no one in line to fill them—and are likely to have serious effects on Trump's ability to put his promises into action. For 470 of 556 key positions that require Senate confirmation, Trump has yet to announce a nominee at all, according to a tracker maintained by the Partnership for Public Service and Washington Post. In nearly half the cases where he has announced a nominee, the White House hasn't formally sent the nominations to the Senate, awaiting clearance from the Office of Government Ethics and an FBI background check. Though many of these empty jobs might sound obscure—deputies, assistant secretaries, general counsels—they're often critical to Trump actually delivering on his promises. Cabinet secretaries serve as the face of their respective departments, but it's the next tier of presidential appointees who do the day-to-day work ensuring Trump’s ideas make real headway through the massive government bureaucracy. Of the 15 deputies in cabinet-level departments, Trump has formally nominated candidates for just four—and only one, Elaine Duke at the Department of Homeland Security, has been confirmed. (Trump's nominee for deputy attorney general is set to be confirmed later today.) In one job, Trump has actually been going backwards: Todd Ricketts, Trump’s original pick for deputy secretary at Commerce, withdrew his nomination last week. And a number of other key jobs outside of the cabinet, from the Federal Reserve to the White House budget office, are still waiting for Trump to formally send nominee names to the Senate. Of course, senior roles in the government aren’t exactly empty. Nearly every unfilled position has someone keeping the seat warm in an acting role. But the lack of permanent personnel creates uncertainty throughout agencies and makes it harder for the Trump administration to develop real proposals to get laws passed. “When you are in an acting role, you are the equivalent of a substitute teacher,” said Max Stier, CEO of the Partnership for Public Administration, a nonpartisan group that has tracked the nomination process. “They can be a phenomenal educator but those around them understand that they are short-termers and are not going to be perceived has having real authority.” The White House blames Democrats for the slow pace of nominations. On NBC’s “Meet the Press” on Sunday, Chief of Staff Reince Priebus argued that cabinet secretaries had to be confirmed before choosing lower level staff. “We've got a secretary of commerce that was chosen in November, not confirmed until February,” Priebus said. “That person is going to take the time to choose who his undersecretaries are.” But the administration hasn't always been so deferential, sometimes nominating deputies along with secretaries—and even after confirmation of cabinet secretaries, the White House been slow to officially nominate the next tier of management. What are the biggest unfilled roles in the Trump administration, beyond the missing cabinet secretaries? Creating an objective ranking is impossible; there’s no way to make direct comparisons across departments. But a number of key unfilled positions stand out, either because of their role within government, or responsibilities in implementing Trump’s specific promises. 1. Deputy Director, Office of Management and Budget. Trump promised to run the government like a business, and he's already taken multiple steps to do so, creating a new Office of American Innovation run by his son-in-law Jared Kushner. But it’s OMB that has the staffing and the actual authority to oversee and reform agencies across the federal government. Following an executive order from Trump, OMB Director Mick Mulvaney released a 14-page memo in April directing agencies to create plans to reduce staff size and become more efficient. It’s an ambitious plan that will require a huge amount of manpower, and Mulvaney is heading into it without the two deputies who are supposed to execute his plans. The OMB deputy director may not sound like an especially powerful position—the wonky No. 2 to an already wonky post—but it's traditionally a crucial job, touching on every corner of the government. As the administration develops its annual budget, the deputy oversees the development of each agency's individual budget, ensuring it actually does what the president wants. In Trump’s case, his budget blueprint for fiscal 2018 proposed sharp cuts, including large reductions in personnel. The OMB deputy director will be tasked with enforcing it. On April 7, Trump announced he was nominating Russ Vought, a former vice president of Heritage Action, the lobbying arm of the conservative think tank Heritage Foundation, for the role, but he has not formally sent the nomination to the Senate. The nomination is a sign of progress, though another big role at OMB also remains unfilled: the deputy director for management, who is responsible for managing day-to-day government functions, such as procurement and IT issues. For that job, there's no nominee in sight. 2. Assistant secretary for tax policy, Treasury Department. Given the difficulties of replacing the Affordable Care Act, tax reform is perhaps the biggest domestic policy issue where Trump could leave a legacy. The last time Congress successfully overhauled the tax code was in 1986, a testament to its difficulty—and an indication to many that the time is ripe for an overhaul. The White House is speeding ahead, releasing a set of principles this week ahead of Trump’s 100th day in office. The Treasury Department is the lead agency overseeing and developing policy ideas on tax issues, and the assistant secretary for tax policy is the department’s top official on taxes. The White House has promised to develop its own tax proposal, a massive undertaking that requires extensive policy development, economic analysis and communication with stakeholders. Central to that process would be—normally—the assistant secretary for tax policy. Trump has yet to announce someone for the position. 3. Deputy secretary, State Department. The president has more direct power over foreign affairs than perhaps any other arena, and Trump has promised a new approach, rethinking the principles and interventionism of both his conservative and liberal predecessors. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, one of Trump’s first major nominees, is new to the federal government and has struggled to navigate the State Department bureaucracy, sidelining senior staff and conducting little outreach to lower level officials. The generals who serve as Trump's key advisers on defense and national security have actually said they need support from State to help the U.S. military, and Trump's young presidency has already faced its share of overseas challenges, starting with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's gassing of his own people, and an increasingly aggressive North Korea, all of which require a strong diplomatic hand. Yet Trump is still trying to operate without one of his most important diplomats: the deputy secretary of state. The exact priorities of the deputy secretary of state change with each administration, but the role oversees the day-to-day operations of the department and plays a senior role in diplomatic relations, including attending National Security Council meetings and representing the United States at international events and conferences. On April 11, Trump said he would nominate John Sullivan, a Republican lawyer, for the job, but has not formally sent the nomination to the Senate. [UPDATE: The White House sent Sullivan's nomination to the Senate on Tuesday.] 4. Deputy secretary, Defense Department. The deputy secretary of defense is a critical position for managing the nation’s armed forces, overseeing the operations and policies of each agency at the Pentagon, which has an annual budget of more than $500 billion. (The military has already provided Trump with his single biggest claim to appearing effective, striking Syrian airfields after Assad's gas attack.) But as with the State Department, Trump has announced—but not formally nominated—someone for the No. 2 position at the Pentagon. In March, he tapped Patrick Shanahan, a Boeing executive, for the role. Robert Work, an Obama holdover, is currently acting deputy secretary of defense. 5. Vice Chair of Supervision, Federal Reserve. Trump has made a great deal of noise about rolling back Dodd-Frank financial reforms and promising to deregulate Wall Street. But he hasn’t formally nominated anyone for perhaps the most important financial regulatory position in the government: the vice chair of supervision at the Federal Reserve. In this, Trump has something in common with Obama, who never formally nominated anyone for the position after the passage of Dodd-Frank in 2010. Former Fed Governor Daniel Tarullo informally filled the role since its creation, but he resigned in April, giving Trump a key opening to shape financial regulatory policy. The vice chair of supervision, who also sits on the Fed Board of Governors, oversees the Fed's oversight of its regulatory responsibilities, which were greatly expanded under the 2010 Dodd-Frank law. They include the annual bank “stress tests” to gauge whether large banks have enough capital to survive an economic downturn and the “living wills” for the banks determined to be systemically important to the economy. Last week, POLITICO reported that Trump plans to choose Treasury veteran Randy Quarles for the job, although the White House has not announced the nomination. Fed Governor Jerome Powell is serving in Tarullo’s place in the interim. In addition, the Fed’s Board of Governors has two other vacancies, the first opportunity for Trump to begin reshaping the central bank. 6. Administrator, Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs. Beyond financial deregulation, Trump has promised to roll back Obama-era regulations across the federal government. In fact one of his first high-profile announcements was an executive order in January requiring agencies to eliminate two regulations for every new regulation issued, among other things. The person in charge of rules overall is the administrator of OIRA, sometimes called the regulatory czar. The job would, presumably, be the linchpin of any major assault on regulations. It's still unfilled, although earlier this month, Trump announced he intended to nominate Neomi Rao, a law professor at George Mason University, for the position. As of press time, however, he has not formally sent the nomination to the Senate. 7. Director, Office of Personnel Management. Along with downsizing agencies, Trump has promised to better use federal resources, removing underperforming employees and promoting effective ones. Such changes will require deep buy-in from agencies, along with significant oversight and direction from the Office of Personnel Management, which effectively oversees the entire government workforce. During the Clinton administration’s reinventing government initiative, for instance, OPM offered federal employees incentives of up to $50,000 to leave their jobs. Eventually, more than 420,000 jobs were cut, with only 25,000 coming through layoffs. If Trump intends to reduce the federal workforce in a similar way, his OPM director will play a critical role. He has yet to announce any nominee for the position.

After the hydrogen is collected, it can be converted into electrical energy for inflight use. This innovation could open doors for less-polluting, more-electric aircraft that substitute pneumatic and hydraulic systems usually powered by the main engine. The revolutionary work was published in the International Journal of Hydrogen Energy. Hydrogen produced onboard the aircraft during flight can be channeled to a fuel cell for electrical energy generation. This technology offers a good solution to several challenges, such as hydrogen storage, without the problems associated with storing hydrogen in a liquid or gas state. Dr. Shani Elitzur, Technion Faculty of Aerospace Engineering While the application of hydrogen fuels has been a probable greener energy solution for a specific period, storing hydrogen has always been an issue. The engineers overcame the hydrogen storage problem by using non-polluting Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) fuel cells and a process of aluminum activation patented by the paper’s co-authors, Prof. Alon Gany and Dr. Valery Rosenband. Dr. Elitzur’s research looked at the reaction between the activated aluminum powder and water (from different types) to generate hydrogen. The technology’s foundation is in the chemical reaction between aluminum powder and water to generate hydrogen. Either waste water or fresh water, already onboard the aircraft, can be used for activation, which means the aircraft need not carry any extra water. Related Stories What are Hydrogen Fuel Cells Used For? Hydrogen Refuelling With HySTAT Hydrogen Stations from Hydrogenics Hydrogen Energy - The Perfect Energy Source for the Future? The spontaneous and continuous reaction between powdered aluminum and water is facilitated by a special thermo-chemical process of aluminum activation the researchers created. The protective properties of the hydroxide or oxide film covering the aluminum particle surface are altered by a small fraction of lithium-based activator diffused into aluminum bulk, allowing water at room temperature to react naturally with the aluminum. The process does produce heat, which the researchers say can be used for many tasks, including de-icing operations, heating food and water in the galley, or heating aircraft fuel before starting the engines. According to the team, their technology would offer: Quieter operations on board an aircraft More efficient electric power generation Significant reductions in CO2 emissions Compact storage; no need for hydrogen storage tanks onboard aircraft Thermal efficiency (fuel cell produced heat can be used for de-icing, heating jet fuel) A reduction in wiring (many fuel cells can be placed near their point of use) Decreased flammable vapors in fuel tanks (Inert gas generation) The possibility of using available, onboard wastewater boosts both the efficiency and safety of the system. Also, the PEM fuel cells exhibit high efficiency in electric energy generation. Dr. Valery Rosenband, Technion Faculty of Aerospace Engineering Aircraft manufacturers, including Airbus and Boeing, have already examined using onboard fuel cells. Boeing has tried them out in smaller aircraft, hoping to use them on its 787-8, the current advanced electric airplane. According to the Technion researchers, fuel cells can even aid in saving energy in airline and airport ground support operations when they are used for systems such as runway light towers and de-icing. Efficient hydrogen production and storage represents the future for efficient and safe aircraft inflight energy needs.

This macro trend is alive and well in travel. Larger travel companies use these models to capitalize on new ideas, markets and technologies that startups pursue. These investments are intended not only to keep close to potential threats to an established business model. There is also a very clear incentive for these companies to be active participants in the industry’s future. Without a stake in potentially disruptive technologies, industry players are either forced to innovate on their own – or face an even-more uncertain future defined exclusively by others. Clearly a commitment to travel startups has become de rigeur in travel. Here’s a detailed look at the ecosystem as it stands today. The GDS: Amadeus and Travelport In May 2015, Amadeus jumped into bed with incubator program Travel Startups to launch Amadeus for Startups. Given that many startups seem to be unfamiliar with the extraordinary complexities of travel, the initiative is primarily focused on education. In announcing the efforts, Amadeus North America’s vice president of online travel said that the effort will align “the technology, investment and academic communities to offer new travel companies a simplified, affordable consulting partnership.” The company is mum in specifics, but claims to have nurtured “dozens of online startup travel and search companies, as well as developers and travel content providers.” Beyond startups, the company also has Amadeus Ventures, which focuses on strategic co-investments in late-stage travel startups. Investments here include Bluesmart, BookingPal, Eva, Yapta, Flyr, and Betterez, as well as successful exits from Cabify (stake sold during subsequent investment rounds) and Olset (purchased by Deem for an undisclosed amount). The investments have slowed somewhat over the past year. Travelport Labs is another approach from the GDS segment. The format of this program is more TechStars-style, with two classes per year and accept up to six teams per class. The Labs program has graduated two classes, with a total of nine graduates so far. Startups accepted into the program will receive a four-month crash course into the world of Travelport, based at the company’s Denver offices. According to the company’s terms, Travelport invests $30,000 in up to ten companies each year, in return for an 8% equity stake. Helping founders and seeing startups learn fast is our jam. https://t.co/MXc9rnRP0i #accelerator #traveltech @raymondcollins3 @wolorewards pic.twitter.com/ZfXZREVGzA — Travelport Labs (@TravelportLabs) April 10, 2017 It makes sense for the primary inventory platforms in travel to get involved at the earlier stages of startups. As early companies make decisions on where to source inventory, the larger entity enjoys a deeper integration with its distribution system. Not to mention the energy and potential future hires that come out of the startup ecosystem. The agencies: Booking.com, Flight Centre and Carlson Wagonlit Booking.com recently announced its first set of startups for its Booster program. Ten businesses will experience a three-week sprint, culminating in a chance to compete for grants of up to 500,000 Euros. These are grants, rather than investments, which makes the program especially unique. The global scope of both the company and the OTA sector has led to a cohort from across the word. Flight Centre looked to its founding story for its incubator, which is named after the first bus: Little Argas. The slogan is to “become a market leader and go global,” which the travel agency promises to offer its chosen startups. The objective is familiar: “Our goal is to work with our partners to nurture new business ideas and fast track travel start-up companies incorporating areas of our DNA. We want to be the destination of choice for a wide range of travel and technology start-ups.” The company partners with current travel startup incubators to help screen, incubate and accelerate startups, which are then plugged into the relevant parts of the group’s experts. The company is actively seeking diversification outside of its core business across a long-term, twenty year horizon. There’s no set amount for the fund, but the company will invest up to $50,000 for 7.5 percent equity. For later stage companies, there’s up to $300,000 for growth and up to $2 million for scaling up. Little Argas made its first investment recently take a stake in an artificial intelligence tools for business travel. While Carlson Wagonlit Travel doesn’t have a standalone incubation process, it has tested the waters as a partner to other organizations supporting travel startups. In 2015, Carlson Wagonlit Travel joined the Paris travel incubator Welcome City Lab as a founding member. A year later the company also inked a partnership with incubator Plug and Play to provide mentorship and support to travel and hospitality related startups. The hotels: Marriott and AccorHotels Hotels are not as active in this space, as there are fewer obvious benefits. There are certainly new technologies that might benefit hotels but there’s not always a clear way to integrate this kind of program into the structure of the hotel business. One exception to this is Marriott. The massive global brand claims to have launched the first hotel innovation program. Called TestBed, the ambitious effort offered startups access to a real-world hotel to test their products. This offered a completely fresh way for a startup to go from product to development, and then use an operational hotel to pilot the technology. There were 150 startups up for consideration, and the two finalists were Dazzle (a voice activated assistant) and Jambo (a location-based professional platform). Another exception is AccorHotels, which captured global headlines with its acquisition of onefinestay for nearly €150 million. This was a capstone purchase, as the brand had several previous investments in accommodation-related startups. The company has also been actively pursuing new strategies, including an investment in digital distribution to move beyond simply its own hotels. Accor has also employed a more internal model for incubating new concepts in hospitality. Outside a hackathon in Russia, the company has focused resources on pushing its internal teams to think like startups, listen to customers, and disrupt its own core business. The result is its new Jo&Joe concept, which will ramp up to 50 units by 2020. By employing the same techniques that startups use, the company hopes to evolve its own business alongside its external investments and acquisitions. The airlines: JetBlue, British Airways, EasyJet and El Al JetBlue has been one of the most active investors in emerging travel and transportation companies. Its venture arm, JetBlue Technology Ventures, invested in a startup called Zunum Aero alongside Boeing. JTV president Bonny Simi explained why the airline made the investment: “We believe that electric propulsion will disrupt the regional airline industry. By investing now, we will literally have a seat at the table to see how this technology evolves.” As a guiding focus, JTV “invest in, incubates and partner with early-stage startups at the intersection of technology, travel and hospitality. JTV has also formed a partnership with Israeli airline El Al on a project called Navigator. The partnership stems from El Al’s own innovation initiative, a centre based in Tel Aviv called Cockpit. Navigator is a four-month accelerator program for startups focused on aviation. According to a joint press release, the program includes access to “strategic partners, initial funding and ongoing close guidance.” Chosen companies will spend three months being mentored in Tel Aviv, followed by one month in Silicon Valley. British Airways is one of the most active legacy airlines in this space, originally launching its UnGrounded Innovation Lab in the Sky back in 2013. More recently, its parent company IAG created a standalone accelerator called Hangar 51. The initial pilot was successful, and the program was repeated again last year. Out of 450 applications, twenty-six startups were selected and four moved on to a ten-week mentorship program with executives. IAG recently announced its investment in two startups as part of the Hangar 51 initiative. The manufacturers: Boeing and Airbus Boeing recently made headlines with its investment in Zunum. The startup is in the early stages of manufacturing an electric-powered regional jet that could make short-haul flying far more economical. The jet is expected to take off starting in 2020. As far as range, the planes can fly up to 700 miles in the earliest configurations. And the planes are small. With only ten to fifty seats, airlines would be able to operate the jets on routes without enough demand for larger regional aircraft.This makes them viable for plugging gaps in regional travel ecosystems. The investment is one of the first for Boeing’s investment arm, HorizonX. Principal Steve Nordlund explains the fund’s goals: “Our charter is to look beyond the horizon. We’re looking at traditional, non-traditional partnerships that help us accelerate innovation and market opportunities.” As far as why he chose to invest in Zunum, Nordlund says: “We want to be close to them to see, number one, if we can be helpful in their success as one of their investors. As well as the innovation that we think they can bring forward.” The company also invested an undisclosed amount in Upskill, a company that provides Google Glass-style technology for assembly workers. Airbus is certainly not out of the race. In 2015, the French firm landed in Silicon Valley with a centre capitalized by a $150 million fund. The A³ group is tasked with building “the future of flight now, by disrupting Airbus Group and its competitors before someone else does”. Cargo and logistics have also seen some interest from airlines, with Lufthansa Cargo participating as an inaugural partner for the Rocketspace Tech Accelerator.

There is more money entering the travel tech ecosystem right now than at any other time. I was at a travel tech conference today in San Francisco and I sent a startup founder to read this post. Funny thing is that we were working on writing up something similar but TNOOZ beat us to the punch. When we launched Travel Startups Incubator in late 2014 there was literally no one funding startups, today there are at least 20 investors dedicated to investing in startups in travel tech at the pre-seed/seed stage many of which you listed here. Kudos to the corporate travel venture arms for stepping in to fund startups in one of the biggest industries in the world. Reply 8 hrs ago   Russell Winter In my experience, when corporations start venture capital divisions it is the sign of the start of a “bubble.” I liken it to when one’s neighbours start investment clubs. As word spreads, more jump in, scared to miss the boat, and then reality sets in with a crash. I laud innovation, but frankly a lot of companies that corporations are investing in at the moment are marginal at best in my opinion.

The C919 prototype, developed by the state-owned Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (Comac) since 2008, is now expected to take off next month, CNN reports. Grounds tests conducted at Shanghai Pudong International Airport saw the 158-seat, narrow-body twin-engine plane simulate takeoff at speeds hitting 170 miles per hour, successfully earning it a special flight permit from the Civil Aviation Administration of China. For more about aviation, watch Fortune's video: The single-aisle aircraft, intended to compete for sales with the Boeing (ba) 737 and the Airbus (airbus.group-n-v) A320 was originally scheduled to make its debut two years ago before encountering repeated delays for additional testing and certification.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 25 April 2017 by Monika Donimirska Near-Term Outlook for Unmanned Combat Aerial Vehicle (UCAV) Industry An unmanned combat aerial vehicle (UCAV), or an attack drone, usually carries aircraft ordnance such as missiles, bombs, and laser weapons. Earlier, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) were primarily used for surveillance and patrolling. With the growing need for operational requirements, UAVs were armed and converted into UCAVs. Broadly, UCAVs are used for surveillance, direction of artillery fire, gathering electronic intelligence (ELINT) information, lasing targets for fighter aircraft, and for post-strike damage assessment. While several nations operate unarmed UAVs, as of 2016, only the US, Turkey, Israel, Italy, Iran, China, India, and Pakistan had manufactured UCAVs.

The hydrogen can then be converted into electrical energy for inflight use. The breakthrough could pave the way for non-polluting, more-electric aircraft that replace current hydraulic and pneumatic systems typically powered by the main engine. The groundbreaking work was reported in a recent paper published in the International Journal of Hydrogen Energy. “Hydrogen produced onboard the aircraft during flight can be channeled to a fuel cell for electrical energy generation,” said lead researcher Dr. Shani Elitzur of the Technion Faculty of Aerospace Engineering. “This technology offers a good solution to several challenges, such as hydrogen storage, without the problems associated with storing hydrogen in a liquid or gas state.” While the use of hydrogen fuels has been a potential greener energy solution for some time, storing hydrogen has always been a problem. The engineers were able to work around the hydrogen storage problem by using non-polluting Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) fuel cells and a process of aluminum activation patented by the paper’s co-authors, Prof. Alon Gany and Dr. Valery Rosenband. Dr. Elitzur’s research was focused on the reaction between the activated aluminum powder and water (from different types) to produce hydrogen. The foundation for the technology is in the chemical reaction between aluminum powder and water to produce hydrogen. Either fresh water or waste water, already onboard the aircraft, can be used for activation, which means the aircraft does not need to carry any additional water. The spontaneous and sustained reaction between powdered aluminum and water is enabled by a special thermo-chemical process of aluminum activation the researchers developed. The protective properties of the oxide or hydroxide film covering the aluminum particle surface are modified by a small fraction of lithium-based activator diffused into aluminum bulk, allowing water at room temperature to react spontaneously with the aluminum. The process does generate heat, which the researchers say can be used for a number of tasks, including heating water and food in the galley, de-icing operations, or heating aircraft fuel prior to starting the engines. According to the researchers, their technology would provide: Quieter operations on board an aircraft Drastic reductions in CO2 emissions Compact storage; no need for hydrogen storage tanks onboard aircraft More efficient electric power generation A reduction in wiring (multiple fuel cells can be located near their point of use) Thermal efficiency (fuel cell generated heat can be used for de-icing, heating jet fuel) Reduced flammable vapors in fuel tanks (Inert gas generation) “The possibility of using available, onboard wastewater boosts both the efficiency and safety of the system,” explained Dr. Rosenband. “Also, the PEM fuel cells exhibit high efficiency in electric energy generation.” Aircraft manufacturers, including Boeing and Airbus, have already investigated using onboard fuel cells. Boeing has experimented with them in smaller aircraft, in anticipation of using them on its 787-8, the current state-of-the-art electric airplane. According to the Technion researchers, fuel cells can even play an energy saving role in airline and airport ground support operations when they are on used for systems such as de-icing and runway light towers. “Efficient hydrogen production and storage represents the future for efficient and safe aircraft inflight energy needs.” summarized Prof. Gany. The Technion-Israel Institute of Technology is a major source of the innovation and brainpower that drives the Israeli economy, and a key to Israel’s renown as the world’s “Start-Up Nation.” Its three Nobel Prize winners exemplify academic excellence. Technion people, ideas and inventions make immeasurable contributions to the world including life-saving medicine, sustainable energy, computer science, water conservation and nanotechnology. The Joan and Irwin Jacobs Technion-Cornell Institute is a vital component of Cornell Tech, and a model for graduate applied science education that is expected to transform New York City’s economy. American Technion Society (ATS) donors provide critical support for the Technion—more than $2 billion since its inception in 1940. Based in New York City, the ATS and its network of supporters across the U.S. provide funds for scholarships, fellowships, faculty recruitment and chairs, research, buildings, laboratories, classrooms and dormitories, and more.

Trump spoke with ISS commander Dr. Peggy Whitson on the day she broke the record for time in orbit by an American, having now spent 535 days off-planet. Whitson, 57, at 1:27 am Washington time on Monday broke the previous record set by Jeff Williams, who until now had been the American who had spent the most time in space. In the videoconference, broadcast live by the NASA television channel, Trump chatted with Whitson and with engineer Jack Fischer, both of whom are aboard the ISS. Seated in the Oval Office with his daughter Ivanka and astronaut Kate Rubins, Trump congratulated Whitson in the name of all Americans for breaking the countrys time-in-space record. Whitson, in turn, said that it was a great honor for her to set the milestone and to be aboard the ISS, noting that its a great time to be working for NASA because of all the pending projects and exciting missions in the offing, including future crewed flights to Mars. In late March, Trump signed a bill allocating $19.5 billion to NASA for the current fiscal year and setting the objective of sending humans to the Red Planet during the 2030s. At one point in their conversation on Monday, the president asked Whitson about the state of NASAs plans to send humans into Mars orbit or onto the planets surface and when that might be possible. Whitson responded that, as per the law Trump had signed in March, getting Americans to Mars would be possible approximately in the 2030s, although she emphasized that  to be successful  such a mission requires a lot of time and money, along with a certain amount of international cooperation. That was when Trump commented that hed like to move up the timeline for the mission so that it could come about during the next eight years, if possible. Last October, then-President Barack Obama said that the US was going down the right road by pursuing cooperation between the government and private companies with an eye toward sending humans to Mars. Currently, several private firms, including Boeing and SpaceX, are working to undertake crewed missions into space with the aim of transporting US astronauts to the ISS without having to depend on third countries, specifically Russia, given that NASA ended its space shuttle program in 2011. When Whitson concludes her ISS mission and returns to Earth on Sept. 3, she will have spent 666 days in space, although six people will have been off-planet for longer than that. Whitson, however, has made other firsts in orbit, being the oldest female astronaut ever to go into space, the first female ISS commander and the woman who has made the most space walks, with eight.   Enter your email address to subscribe to free headlines (and great cartoons so every email has a happy ending!) from the Latin American Herald Tribune:   RSS Feed [ Home ] [ About Us ] [ Who's Who ] [ Contacts ] [ Help ] Copyright Latin American Herald Tribune - 2005-2015 © All rights reserved

Major banks could move many of their employees to the continent. [Michael Garnett/Flickr] Comments Print This article is part of our special report Brexit: Where to, Brefugees?. Britain’s labour market has so far been resilient but salaries could fall as a result of increased competition after the country exits the EU. The UK’s decision to leave the EU after 44 years of membership was expected to trigger the perfect labour storm, frightening away companies and investors and lowering output. But uncertainty took less of a toll than expected and Britain has even succeeded in creating new jobs. However, this resilience may be tempered by falling salaries as a result of increased competition once the divorce is settled. The UK’s Labour Force Survey reported this month that, between September and November 2016 and in the three months to February 2017, the number of people in work increased and the number of unemployed fell. The number of people in work reached 31.84 million from December 2016 to February 2017, 39,000 more than for September to November 2016 and 312,000 more than the same period 12 months earlier. Employment stood at 74.6%, the highest since the survey began in 1971. The Brief: What happens next with Brexit The UK today said it will fire the starting gun on Brexit by triggering Article 50, the legal process taking the country out of the bloc, on 29 March. Meanwhile, there were 1.56 million unemployed, 45,000 fewer than for September to November 2016 and 141,000 fewer than a year earlier. John Springford, director of research at the Centre for European Reform, explained that the economic slowdown and job losses have been less dramatic than predicted, as British consumers have kept spending on the back of their savings. In addition, he noted that Britain’s labour market has proven to be “extremely flexible”, pointing to an unemployment rate that remained under 8% during the 2007-2008 financial crisis. The European Commission agrees. “Although the moderation in GDP growth may have a lagged impact on employment, the effect is expected to be relatively limited, reflecting the flexible response of real wages to weaker demand,” the institution said in its winter forecast published last February. Days before the Commission’s forecast, the governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, stated that “growth has remained resilient since the referendum”. Its robustness led the central bank to conclude that the UK economy will be capable of maintaining the unemployment level below the 5% threshold at least until 2019, when the formal Brexit talks should reach their conclusion. “Brexit journey is just beginning” Carney’s optimism went beyond the Commission’s forecast. Brussels did not improve its unemployment rate for the UK, as it predicts 5.6% in 2018. The executive will update its forecast for the EU member states on 11 May. But Carney warned that “the Brexit journey is just beginning”. The future of jobs in the UK will depend largely on the future Association Agreement that London and Brussels will start negotiating once the divorce terms have been settled, most likely after this autumn. This new relationship will not only bring the certainty that firms need to hire and spend, but it will also clarify how easily UK-based companies will be able to continue operating on EU soil. Currently, some 12% of UK goods and services are exported to EU member states, translating into 3.3 million jobs. The City of London looks set to suffer the most as a result of the break-up. Financial players could lose their passport to do business freely across the Channel. Law firms and accounting companies would be collateral victims. Brexit will destroy the City of London as we know it Should the UK vote to leave the EU in a future referendum, the decision will have far-reaching and damaging consequences for London’s financial sector, writes Sajjad Karim. Almost 1.1 million people worked in the financial services sector in the UK in 2015. The services sector, especially financial and business services, today represents 41% of UK exports compared with 28% in 1997. Other major exporters, like car manufacturers and suppliers “could be forced to retrench if obstacles to exporting to the EU increase”, said Iain Begg and Fabian Mushövel from the London School of Economics. The automotive industry, together with the aerospace industry, computer and electronics, and pharmaceuticals industries, represents an important source of GDP growth and job creation for the UK. Silver lining? But big manufacturers like Boeing and Google have expressed their commitment to creating new jobs in the UK once it leaves the EU. There could be also a silver lining on the cloudy horizon of the complex divorce. Some industries could see job growth as they become more competitive, “either because a new trade regime raises the costs of imports or because they can then avoid regulations that impair their competitiveness”, said Begg and Mushövel. As migration restrictions will be strengthened, low-paid jobs, such as plumbers and nannies, could also see demand for workers rise. In order to maintain the export pulse, experts are eyeing the digital and creative industries as important drivers. Unless both sides fail to seal a deal on the Brexit divorce and a new relationship, CER’s Springford said that the job market will remain stable. While in the short term there could be some relocation, in particular in the financial sector, in the long run the effect will be increased competition. This will push up production and wages could be slashed. In addition, as savings continue to fall to historic low levels and inflation rises, Springford also warned that private consumption would no longer be the lifeline of the British economy. Fighting for new jobs In Europe, the EU institutions and national governments have repeated that while Brexit is bad news for the UK economy, it will also have adverse effects on their markets. But behind their public lamentations, the EU’s national governments are fighting tooth and nail to poach thousands of jobs from the British Isles. Commission wants to speed up relocation of UK-based agencies The European Commission wants to find a new seat for London-based EU agencies as soon as possible. The United Kingdom will have no say in the process. France, Germany, the Netherlands and Luxembourg are competing to attract well-paid bankers and traders. A total of 89% of the employees (26,629) of the top five investment banks (Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, JP Morgan, Citigroup and Bank of America Merrill Lynch) are based in the UK. Around 40% of top 250 companies have their headquarters in London, compared with 8% in Paris, the second European capital on the list. Meanwhile, carmarkers could move their operations in the UK to countries like Spain, in the case of Nissan-Renault, or Germany, in the case of Ford.

Top Asia-Pacific experts delivered that news to lawmakers at a Senate Armed Services Committee, which covered a range of possible outcomes on U.S. engagement with China and North Korea to deter a threatened missile capability. The hearing was held a day ahead of a planned Senate briefing on North Korea at the White House.  "We're all going to the White House tomorrow night to be briefed," Graham said. "[There are] no good choices left, but if there's a war today, it's over there. In the future, if there's a war and they get a missile, it comes here." The panel of experts were also skeptical that China will exert economic pressure against North Korea to change its behavior.

Six trailers carrying parts of the THAAD system were taken to a deployment site at a South Korean golf course. ADVERTISEMENT The decision to move the equipment ignited a dispute between law enforcement officials and local residents, Yonhap reported. The move comes amid increased tensions between the U.S. and North Korea. Concerns have grown in recent weeks that the north could be preparing to launch its sixth nuclear test. Meanwhile, the U.S. has increased its military presence in the region, saying earlier this month that it would be sending a Navy strike group closer to the Korean Peninsula. Top Trump administration officials have repeatedly said that they are keeping military options on the table. Read the rest here.   ARMY NOMINEE PUSHES BACK ON CRITICS OF LGBT RECORD: Army secretary nominee Mark Green is pushing back on critics who he says are "blatantly falsifying" his past statements. "The liberal left has cut and spliced my words about terrorism and ISIS blatantly falsifying what I've said," Green said in a Facebook post Tuesday. "I believe that every American has a right to defend their country regardless of race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity and religion. It's the radical left that won't allow the latter." The post linked to an article defending Green on a website that says it's geared toward Christians in the military. LGBT groups have criticized Green's nomination because of comments he has made in the past, as well as based on his record as a Tennessee state senator. Read more here.   TOP DEMS PUSH TRUMP ON SYRIA STRIKE: Two top Democrats are asking President Trump to provide legal justification for this month's missile strike on a Syrian airfield. "It has now been over two weeks since you ordered the strike on the airfield, and your administration has yet to put forward any detailed legal analysis or justification for that action under domestic and international law," Sen. Tim KaineTim KaineOvernight Defense: US moving missile defense system to South Korea | Dems want justification for Syria strike | Army pick pushes back against critics of LGBT record Kaine, Schiff press Trump on legal justification for Syria strike Democrats thought they could produce a political earthquake in Kansas MORE (D-Va.) and Rep. Adam SchiffAdam SchiffOvernight Defense: US moving missile defense system to South Korea | Dems want justification for Syria strike | Army pick pushes back against critics of LGBT record Kaine, Schiff press Trump on legal justification for Syria strike Schiff to Trump: Taxpayers will 'bear the brunt of your broken promises' MORE (D-Calif.) wrote in a letter to Trump released Tuesday. "The legal justification for an attack on the Syrian government is not an afterthought, but rather a first order consideration, and something that is vital for the American people to understand at the outset." Trump ordered the April 6 strike on the air base in retaliation for a chemical attack on civilians that U.S. officials say was carried out by forces loyal to Syrian President Bashar Assad. The strike was the first time the U.S. military has directly intervened in the six-year-old Syrian civil war.

"The deployment has been planned for some time, has no relations to current events and was conducted in close coordination with Estonian allies," the Air Force said in a release Tuesday. "It allows the F-35A to engage in familiarization training within the European theater while reassuring allies and partners of U.S. dedication to the enduring peace and stability of the region." The deployment, though, comes at a time of heightened tension with Russia after the U.S. missile strike against Syrian President Bashar Assad, an ally of Moscow.

About us Membership Contact us Wed April 26, 2017 Home Society Economy Politics Sports Culture Multimedia Iran to receive 3 ATR airplanes in 3 weeks Economy April 25, 2017 TEHRAN- Iran’s national flag-carrier airline Iran Air signed a contract for purchasing 20 turboprop passenger planes from the French-Italian aircraft manufacturer ATR in mid-April and three planes of the kind will be delivered to the country in three weeks, Managing Director of Iran Air Farhad Parvaresh announced, Mehr news agency reported on Tuesday. The agreement was signed in Tehran between Parvaresh and the CEO of ATR Christian Scherer. According to the contract, four of the accorded 70-seat ATRs were supposed to be delivered to Iran within a month from the date of the signing agreement and five ones of them were to be received by 2017 yearend. The rest will arrive by the end of 2018. ATR has reportedly vowed to assist Iran with training pilots and providing technical services, too. Jointly owned by Airbus and Italian company Leonardo, ATR said the deal is worth $536 million at list prices.  The contract with ATR follows deals between Iran Air and plane giants Airbus and Boeing for 180 passenger jets. It is signed after months of talks that required navigating a way through separate U.S. sanctions and regulations still in place.

Facebook Twitter Google + Email Print Infrastructure plan meets 'polite and quiet resistance' By Tanya Snyder and Brianna Gurciullo 04/25/17 10:00 AM EDT With help from Stephanie Beasley GO BIG OR … : At Monday night’s POLITICO event, Rebuilding America: A New Infrastructure Agenda (full video here), Sens. Deb Fischer (R-Neb.) and Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) both supported the new push in Washington to revitalize the nation’s infrastructure, but they differed on ways to go about it. Fischer wants to see each element — airports, broadband, roads — get its own bill, while Klobuchar argued it was best to “go big.” Story Continued Below What they agreed on: Fischer and Klobuchar both seek to preserve rural interests — both in an infrastructure bill and a possible restructuring of the air traffic control system. Fischer said public-private partnerships “don’t work in every state” and noted that she’ll be “watching the funding to make sure that funding is going to be available to states that aren’t going to be able to take advantage of [P3s].” Klobuchar agreed: “Yeah, we don’t have a lot of toll roads [in Minnesota].” And when Klobuchar noted her concerns with House Republicans’ plan to separate air traffic control from the FAA — concerns related to rural service and general aviation — Fischer echoed the sentiment. ‘Polite and quiet resistance’: David McIntosh, president of the Club for Growth, said Trump’s infrastructure plan “has run into a lot of polite and quiet resistance among Republicans if it’s not offset and paid for.” He said his group was concerned about the $1 trillion price tag but wouldn’t necessarily rule it out if it focused on spending offsets and private investment rather than tax increases. McIntosh admitted that “a compelling case has been made for investments in transportation in the country.” Gas tax spat: While Ed Mortimer, executive director of transportation infrastructure at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said the current level of enthusiasm about infrastructure represents a “once-in-a-lifetime opportunity” to raise sustainable revenues, McIntosh insisted that a gas tax hike was not good business. “The real business response would not be to automatically raise prices on their customers — in fact they’re disciplined in a market environment not to be able to do that,” McIntosh said. “The real business response would be to say, ‘How do we take those billions of dollars and actually squeeze down the cost?’ That, we’ve failed to do.” MT CONTEST: When will the Trump administration release an infrastructure proposal? Whoever’s guess is closest to the actual date will be invited to our office for coffee and donuts with their favorite transportation reporters. (That’s us, jerks.) Place your bets: bgurciullo@politico.com and tsnyder@politico.com. Subject line: Infrastructure contest. April 30 will be your last day to send your guess.

When I'm hangin' out drinking in the back of an El Camino.” (h/t Pro Budget & Appropriations Brief’s Sarah Ferris, who proudly knows every word to this song) Want to keep up with MT’s song picks? Follow our Spotify playlist. THE TIMELINE IT IS A-CHANGING: Don’t blink or you might miss another shift in the ongoing saga of when the Trump administration’s infrastructure plan might be unveiled. Last week, Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao told the Boston Globe that she expects the administration to release its $1 trillion plan this summer. She had previously indicated that it might come out in May. “We’re on track,” Chao told the Globe. “There’s a great deal of discussion over the most difficult part of the initiative, which is funding it.” When asked about Trump’s proposed budget cuts, especially to public transportation, Chao said states “need to plan for the future” and that Congress will do what it wants. “Let’s see what the budget process will yield,” she said. Spicer concurs: In his press briefing Monday, White House press secretary Sean Spicer sought to lower expectations on the infrastructure bill. “That's another thing that's on the list, but I think we seem to have our hands full right now with healthcare and tax reform,” Spicer said. “[Trump] is obviously still committed to seeing infrastructure, something he's talked about a lot in terms of roads and bridges and rebuilding things. But let's get these first two things moving. But I think you're going to see a continued commitment to infrastructure as well.” CHAO ON THE ROAD: Chao was on the road again Monday, touring Ohio’s Transportation Research Center with Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio), part of an administration push to get Cabinet secretaries out into the community to mark President Donald Trump’s 100th day in office. Chao toured the facility’s 7.5-mile high-speed vehicle testing track and the 50-acre vehicle dynamics area. The center is preparing to start testing automated vehicles, which Chao said “can significantly increase mobility and safety.” She said she was "pleased to see firsthand a public-private partnership that will help make the automotive industry and Ohio a leader in the President's plan to create jobs and growth in the innovation economy.” 1 … 2 … P3: DOT has given the green light to an initial request to let Missouri’s biggest airport become a part of an FAA pilot program meant to help airports “generate access to sources of private capital for airport improvement and development,” the department said in a release Monday. Chao said in a statement that DOT’s decision regarding St. Louis Lambert International Airport “demonstrates the administration’s commitment to leveraging innovative financing strategies to revitalize our nation’s aviation infrastructure.” St. Louis officials are now expected to identify a private operator for Lambert. Not set in stone: “This is a great opportunity to explore a public-private partnership for the airport,” Lyda Krewson, the mayor of St. Louis, said in a statement. “I appreciate their consideration of our application and look forward to working with the FAA throughout the process, but as always, the key is in the details.” CLOCK TICKING FOR WMATA: FTA is threatening to cut some of WMATA’s grant funding if the agency doesn’t come up with a better worker protection plan this week, our Stephanie Beasley reports for Pros. There have been at least four instances in which WMATA workers were allowed on roadways without proper authorization and trains traveled through work zones without waiting for a signal that the area was clear, FTA told WMATA General Manager Paul Wiedefeld. If the problems aren't addressed in five calendar days, WMATA stands to lose up to 25 percent of its urban formula grant funding. ON THE LEGISLATIVE MENU: The House will vote today on a bill (S. 496) to do away with a DOT rule on metropolitan planning organizations. The Senate passed the same measure last month. The House will also vote on a bill (H.R. 876) introduced by Rep. John Katko, the chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee’s transportation-focused panel, related to screening for aviation workers. GOOD TO KNOW: “If a partial government #shutdown starts this weekend, here is how @USDOT would implement one there,” the Eno Center for Transportation’s Jeff Davis tweeted Monday, linking to this. GM ON THE HOOK FOR IGNITION-SWITCH DEFECT: The Supreme Court refused Monday to consider GM’s appeal to block hundreds of lawsuits over an ignition-switch defect that has killed 124 people and injured 275 more. GM had argued that it had bankruptcy protection against those lawsuits, but the New York-based Second Circuit Court of Appeals last year, and the Supreme Court Monday, rejected that claim. GM stock rose $0.33 Monday despite the ruling. What was that defect again? The faulty ignition switch could cause the engine to stall without warning, cutting power to brakes, steering and airbag systems. "Hundreds of death and injury cases have been frozen in place for years as GM wrongly tried to hide behind a fake bankruptcy," Robert Hilliard, lead counsel for the plaintiffs, said in a statement, as reported by Reuters. "Now, GM can hide no more." MORE, MORE, MORE: Qatar Airways will start a route to San Francisco next year, bringing the airline’s destinations in the United States to a total of 15, Bloomberg reports. The news follows Emirates Airline’s decision to roll back some flights to the United States — a change it said comes in response to lower demand, which it blamed on the Trump administration’s travel and electronics bans. Etihad Airways, meanwhile, has said demand “continues to remain strong on all 45 weekly services between Abu Dhabi and its six US gateways of New York, Washington, Chicago, San Francisco, Los Angeles and Dallas.” LISTEN UP! POLITICO Europe’s Cathy Buyck talked with the top negotiators of the EU-U.S. Open Skies agreement signed in 2007. “It was a landmark agreement in many aspects for both sides, removing significant restrictions on pricing, capacity and frequencies,” Cathy reports. She chatted with John Byerly, former deputy assistant secretary for transportation affairs at the State Department, and Daniel Calleja, former director for air transport for DG Move. Check out the podcast here. SLICE OF PI: “Boeing has added Mark Lippert as vice president of international government affairs,” our friends at POLITICO Influence report. “Lippert was previously the U.S. ambassador to South Korea, where he survived a knife attack in 2015. He has also held senior positions at the Pentagon.” SHIFTING GEARS: John Wetzel is leaving the Association of American Railroads, where he has been vice president of government affairs for over a decade. “Though officially retiring, he will not be slowing down,” AAR spokeswoman Jessica Kahanek said. “Next week, Wetzel and his wife of 38 years, Angela, will start hiking all 40 miles of the Maryland stretch of Appalachian Trail.” Bret Manley, who has worked as legislative director in Rep. Jeff Denham’s office, will head to AAR in May to do government affairs. Denham, a California Republican, is the chairman of the House Transportation railroads subcommittee. THE AUTOBAHN: — “Amtrak at a junction: invest in improvements, or risk worsening problems.” The New York Times. — "White House ‘confident’ of averting shutdown as Trump shows flexibility on wall." The Washington Post. — “Lawyer representing David Dao now working with woman in American Airlines incident.” NBC News. — “Amazon forms team to focus on driverless technology.” The Wall Street Journal. — “With budget debate looming, growing share of public prefers bigger government.” Pew Research Center. — “21 potential jurors dismissed in first day of Corrine Brown trial.” News4Jax. — “Why doctors should consider giving their patients a ride.” POLITICO. — “U.S. Supreme Court deals struggling taxi industry another blow.” The Chicago Sun-Times. — "Lyft drivers sue Uber saying it spied on them to gain edge." Bloomberg. THE COUNTDOWN: DOT appropriations run out in 3 days. The FAA reauthorization expires in 158 days. Highway and transit policy is up for renewal in 1,255 days. « View Archives Authors: Tanya Snyder tsnyder@politico.com Brianna Gurciullo bgurciullo@politico.com @brigurciullo About The Author Tanya Snyder is a POLITICO Pro transportation reporter.

At 1.27 a.m. ET on April 24 she became the U.S. astronaut with the longest cumulative time spent in space: 534 days, 2 hours, 49 minutes and counting. Whitson took the crown during her third long-duration mission, beating Jeff Williams, who had racked up 534 days, 2 hours and 48 minutes. In her previous two missions to the ISS in 2002 and 2008, Whitson recorded a total 376 days in space. Her current mission started in November, when she set off from Kazakhstan with Russian cosmonaut Oleg Novitskiy and French astronaut Thomas Pesquet, and will end in September, when she will have clocked in a record of more than 650 days spent in space. U.S. President Donald Trump, his daughter and special adviser Ivanka Trump, and NASA astronaut Kate Rubins are expected to make a 20-minute, Earth-to-space call at 10 a.m. ET Monday to congratulate Whitson. NASA will screen the call live via its television channel and via social media: Subscribe to Newsweek from $3.25 per week The Iowa native is accustomed to making space history. She became the first woman to command the ISS in 2008 and in April she became the first woman to do that twice. Whitson, who at 57 is also the oldest woman to go to space, began her NASA career in the 1980s after gaining a doctorate in biochemistry. She became an astronaut in 1996 and made her first trip to the ISS in 2002. In 2009 she became the first woman to be appointed chief of the Astronaut Office, a position she held until 2012. U.S. Astronaut Peggy Whitson flew to her third mission to the International Space Station (ISS) in November 2016. When her mission ends in September, she will have spent more than 650 cumulative days in space. Maxim Zmeyev/Reuters In March, her eighth spacewalk set a new record for the most spacewalks by a woman and she is set to make her ninth on May 12, increasing her time of more than 53 hours spent outside the space station. The recent spacewalks aim to prepare the space stations for the arrival of commercial spaceships in the years to come, fitting the exterior of the outpost with parking spots for a new generation of crew vehicles flying astronauts to the ISS, as per the plans of companies such as SpaceX and Boeing. Whitson commented on her achievement via social media accounts. “It is one of those rides that you hope never ends. I am so grateful for all those who helped me on each of my missions! #LifeInSpace” she wrote on Twitter. NASA encouraged supporters to cheer on the astronaut with the hashtag #CongratsPeggy.

Washington is awash with commentary that the president is "moving to the center" and abandoning his conservative principles for a more "moderate" posture pushed by son-in-law Jared Kushner and other New Yorkers who don't share the heartland populism of Trump's most ardent supporters. In recent weeks, the president has swiftly altered his position on a range of topics: the relevance of NATO, trade relations with China and Mexico, the Federal Reserve, and the value of the Export-Import Bank, which finances American companies doing business abroad. "As he nears 100 days in the White House, Mr. Trump has demonstrated that while he won office on a populist message, he has not consistently governed that way," reports The New York Times. But to frame these changes as an ideological shift, from the right to the center, misunderstands this president and his approach to politics. He is not an ideologue. He has no fixed principles or goals, except to win, to make a deal, to enhance his own ego and reputation. As he has often made clear, his business experience taught him to be a pragmatist, to consider the world as it is, not as it should be. And that practicality is emerging as a core element of his presidency. That's why he's marginalizing advisers like Steve Bannon, a hard-eyed bomb-throwing nationalist who is clearly out of sync with Trump's essential nature. And why he's elevating business types like Kushner and former Goldman Sachs executive Gary Cohn, who share Trump's basic worldview that you do what it takes to get the deal done. The president's pragmatic streak alarms and even enrages true believers, who thought they were promoting a kindred spirit. As one Bannon ally told The Wall Street Journal: "We didn't elect Kushner to bring a New York establishment mentality to Washington. The reason we worked so hard and gave so much money was because we were promised a nationalist revolution. We didn't send him there to go native once he gets to Washington, D.C." This is Bernieism, but on the right: the willful self-delusion that this is somehow a revolutionary country. In fact, thank goodness, this is a stable, centrist country that will celebrate the 241st anniversary of its last revolution this July. Sure, Trump keeps employing overheated rhetoric on issues like immigration and the media, but he's never been a revolutionary -- or even a Republican. He's a Trumpian, and true Trumpians recognize reality. Take China. During the campaign, Trump bashed Beijing as a bad commercial partner and threatened a trade war to set things right. Once in office, the world looks very different. The president's discovered that he needs China, so he's offering a bargain: You rein in North Korea, I'll ease up on trade demands. As Trump told the Journal after his meeting with Chinese president Xi Jinping: "Now, I did say -- but you want to make a great deal? Solve the problem in North Korea. ... That's worth having not as good a trade deal as I would normally be able to make." A "nationalist revolution" that's not. Or take NATO. Trump called it "obsolete" during the campaign, but after meeting with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, he declared, "It's no longer obsolete." Trump has now realized that for all his happy talk about Russia during the campaign, Moscow under Vladimir Putin remains an aggressive and expansionist power -- and NATO exists for a very good reason: to check and balance that power. Once more, reality reigns. Another instructive example of Trump's pragmatism is the Ex-Im Bank, which enjoyed bipartisan support for more than 80 years before Tea Party types started blasting it as an example of "crony capitalism." Candidate Trump -- he of no fixed principles -- adopted the line as a handy way to burnish his populist credentials. But corporate executives like Dennis Muilenburg of Boeing have told him the truth: the Ex-Im Bank is a valuable asset to America's job-creating companies that want to compete in the global marketplace. "So instinctively you would say it's a ridiculous thing, but actually it's a very good thing and it actually makes money," Trump conceded to the Journal. The president is still an impulsive, intemperate and unqualified leader, but his lack of fixed principles could turn out to be an advantage. He seems willing to listen and learn, at least on some issues, and that's a positive sign.
