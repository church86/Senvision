(Boeing) Share Written by Leslie Josephs Obsession Getting There September 19, 2016 Meet Boeing, lighting designer. The company that designed the 747 jumbo jet and helped drive down the cost of air travel worldwide is hard at work on its planes’ interiors. Boeing is trying to patent a projection system that would allow the airplane maker to project images, such as a blue sky with fair-weather clouds or stars, onto the plane’s surfaces interior surfaces, like ceilings and walls, according to a filing published last week. “Projection lighting is simply one of many technologies we are exploring to see if it can bring advances in both airline economics and passenger experience,” a Boeing spokesman said. “In theory, airlines could use lighting enhancements on the walls and bulkheads to display information about destinations or to project scenes that get passengers thinking about where they’re going.” (Courtesy Boeing) It’s part of the airline industry’s current mood-lighting movement. Aircraft manufacturers and airlines are trying to improve their cabins’ historically harsh cabin lighting schemes, which had largely consisted of florescent lights and harsh overhead reading lights that shouldn’t be looked at directly for more than three seconds. Aircraft manufacturers are trying to make their planes ever-more attractive to buyers. Some airlines are favoring planes that are smaller, cost less, and are cheaper to fly. Carriers are also scaling back on some of their airplane purchases altogether to save money. And airlines want to make their planes more attractive to customers, as they battle for passengers amid historically low fares and higher competition from discount carriers and traditional airlines. Whether the images of clouds or the expanse of space (may we also suggest dogs?) gives the illusion of a more spacious ride is yet to be seen, but small changes could make what is a cramped, uncomfortable ride for most of us, a little more pleasant.

One of Boeing's most important customers just said something very troubling Business Insider 9/19/2016 Benjamin Zhang © Provided by Business Insider Norwegian Air Shuttle Boeing 787 Norwegian Air is making waves in the airline industry. Quotes in the article Boeing Co BOE ▼ 146.92 -0.05 -0.03% Norwegian Air Shuttle ASA 0FGH ▼ 268.51 -4.30 -1.58% Recently, Norwegian Air chief commercial officer Thomas Ramdahl told Business Insider in an interview his airline plans to launch $69 fares on trans-Atlantic flights starting next year. As a long-time Boeing customer, Norwegian selected the new generation 737 MAX 8 to launch the new fare. In fact, the airline, who currently operates a fleet made up exclusively of more than 100 Boeing jets, has 100 of the planes on order. But there's more to this story.

In other words, Norwegian is in need of a tweener. Traditionally, those routes have been the domain of Boeing's 757. However, Boeing discontinued the controversial plane in 2004 and still does not have an aircraft capable of matching its capabilities. Although Boeing did tell Business Insider that it is currently studying the possibility of a 757 replacement.© Provided by Business Insider Airbus A321neo That's where the 30 A321neo LR jets Norwegian ordered from Boeing's arch rival Airbus comes into play. "From the figures I've seen so far, the A321neo LR will have longer range than the MAX, so that gives us opportunities in smaller cities where frequency is more important having a large wide-body jet," Ramdahl said. While some airlines are holding onto its aging fleets of 757s, Norwegian seems to believe that it may have found a worthy successor for the long-serving jet. "It's difficult to say yes or no, but I think so," Ramdahl told us when asked if the A321neo LR is a true replacement for the 757. "It's interesting to see if Boeing is coming up with a replacement for the 757 as well, because they'll need to if the LR does what Airbus is saying it will do." In fact, Ramdahl told us that the A321neo offers 10% to 15% lower costs per seat than a wide-body jet. Based on Airbus' projected range of more than 4,600 miles, the A321neo LR should be able to match or beat the 757's range, the Norwegian executive told Business Insider. In addition, Norwegian Air's A321's are expected to be equipped with 220 to 230 seats — which is on par with the capacity of the 757-200.  © Provided by Business Insider Boeing 757 La Compagnie This is potentially distressing news for Boeing. Even though the segment traditionally occupied by the 757 is not as large as the 737s or as profitable as the large wide-bodies, there is still plenty of demand for airplanes of its type. With the Boeing answer to the LR — the 737 MAX 9 — being old-sold 5-1, it looks like Airbus is the only one with a truly competitive product on offer in the segment. And if a major, long-time customer just as Norwegian is willing to defect, then it certainly stacks the deck against Boeing when it comes to conquest customers. The 737 MAX jets features new fuel-efficient CFM LEAP-1B engines, upgraded avionics, and aerodynamics. It's one of the most advanced and efficient airliners in the world. The A321neo LR also feature upgraded avionics and aerodynamics, but is equipped by a more powerful CFM LEAP-1A engine. However, Boeing is not in a position to simply bolt on larger engines to match the A321neo LR's range because there is a direct correlation between the diameter of a turbofan engine's fan blades and the amount of thrust the engine can produce. For example, the more powerful 1A engine's fan blades have a diameter of 78 inches — nine more than the 1B. © Provided by Business Insider Boeing 737Max Norwegian An upgrade to a larger engine will likely involve a redesign of the 737's landing gear. That's because the 737 was designed in the 1960s to be powered by Pratt & Whitney's JT8D engine with a much more compact fan diameter of 49 inches. Since then, Boeing has been bolting on larger and larger engines on the 737, but the under-wing space has not changed. The 737 has essentially maxed out on the engine size that can fit under its wings. As a result, Boeing will have to raise and relocate the plane's landing gear. This means that regardless of whether it decides to modify the 737 or build a new plane from scratch, it'll be a move that will likely cost billions. Norwegian expects to take delivery of its 737 MAX 8 in 2017 with the first A321neo LR expected in 2019.

MAGAZINE SUBSCRIBE WIN FUTURETECH ADVERTISE CONTACT US Wheels Tech Science Videos Test How to How to make How to fix Biofuel takes off 19 September 2016  print 0 Previous Next Air travel is predicted to treble in the next two decades. To cope, we will need nearly 40 000 new commercial aircraft. But more travel means more pollution, so there’s renewed vigour in the hunt for aviation biofuel. On a modest 50 hectares in the sleepy farmlands around Marble Hall in Limpopo, a quiet revolution in air travel is under way. That’s where a leafy plant sprouting from the red clay soil is being hailed as the answer to the challenge of creating sustainable aviation biofuel. The plant in question is Solaris, a member of the tobacco family (nicotine-free, for what it’s worth). Oil from Solaris seeds is converted into bio-jet fuel in a process developed and patented by the Italian company Sunchem Holding. What’s more, in time to come, emerging technologies are expected to exploit the leaves and stems to increase biofuel production. With the first harvest barely in, already there’s talk of an imminent test flight. That flight is planned for this year, in collaboration with SAA. Boeing and SAA, along with partners SkyNRG and Sunchem SA, are driving the local biofuel venture, which involves both commercial and small-scale farmers. If test farming in Marble Hall is successful, the project will be expanded to more farms in South Africa – and potentially to other countries. Since aviation biofuel was approved for commercial use in 2011, airlines have conducted more than 2 000 commercial flights using it. About three types have been approved by ASTM (the American Society of the International Association for Testing and Materials) International, the worldwide standards organisation. Demand and interest in the fuel are high, from both airlines and the military. The problem: insufficient supply. Refinery capacity remains small, the fuel comes at a price premium and currently sustainable feedstock is available in limited quantities only. “SAA continues to work towards becoming the most environmentally sustainable airline in the world and is committed to a better way of conducting business,” says Ian Cruickshank, Environmental Affairs Specialist, SAA Group. “The impact that the biofuel programme will have on South Africans is astounding: thousands of jobs mostly in rural areas, new skills and technology, energy security and stability and macro-economic benefits to South Africa and, of course, a massive reduction in the amount of CO2 that is emitted into our atmosphere.” Boeing International’s managing director for Africa, J Miguel Santos,said it is exciting to see early progress in South Africa towards develop-ing sustainable aviation biofuel from energy-producing tobacco plants. “Boeing strongly believes that our aviation biofuel collaboration with South African Airways will benefit the environment and public health while providing new economic opportunities for South Africa’s small farmers. This project also positions our valued airline customer to gain a long-term, viable domestic fuel supply and improve South Africa’s national balance of payments.” The project is intended to support South African Airways’ environmental goals as well as national objectives for economic and rural development. Solaris-based jet fuel will meet the Roundtable of Sustainable Biomaterial’s CO2 life cycle reduction threshold of at least 50 per cent. When produced in an optimised supply chain set-up, savings are expected to reach up to 80 per cent, compared with fossil jet fuel (www.projectsolaris.co.za) The partners in the South African venture are leaders in the field. Boeing, which describes itself as the industry leader in global efforts to develop and commercialise sustainable aviation biofuel, is involved in about 20 biofuel collaborations spanning the globe. Besides its South African connection, it is also active in the United States, Middle East, Europe, China, Japan, Southeast Asia, Brazil and Australia. SkyNRG (www.skynrg.com) sees its mission as creating sustainable fuels for transport segments that have no other green alternative in the foreseeable future: aviation, marine and heavy trucking. It is the world market leader for bio-jet fuel, supplying more than 20 airlines worldwide. Maarten van Dijk, the organisation’s chief technology officer, described the Solaris project’s launch as an important milestone for his organisation. “(It) marks the start of our first operational feedstock project,” he says. “Commitment of all partners in the supply chain is crucial to realise our joint ambition and make this project a success and that’s why we’re proud to work together with Sunchem SA, Boeing and SAA. We also want to thank the Dutch Government for its strong support in this project, and for the development in sustainable jet fuel in general.” After two years of proving Solaris’ potential in small-scale trials, it is exciting to see the parts falling into place and work in progress on the next phase of the project, adds Joost van Lier, managing director of Sunchem SA. There is a strong belief in the project’s potential as a great opportunity for both commercial and community farmers. The final member of the collaboration, Sunchem Biofuel Development South Africa, is a joint venture between Sunchem Holding and an international group of investors/entrepreneurs, seasoned in developing alternative energy initiatives in Southern Africa. Trials with Solaris, dating back to 2013, have shown encouraging results. On the production side, the initial 11 hectares produced three tons of oil, six tons of press cake/animal feed and 45 tons of fresh biomass per hectare. Socially, they also helped forge strong ties with the commercial farming community and the regional smallholder farming co-ops. Emissions baseline confirmed Tough standards on new commercial aircraft CO2 emissions due to come into force from 2020 will lay down a strict do-not-exceed maximum fuel burn per flight kilometre. From 2023, this will also apply to existing aircraft designs still in manufacture. Commercial air travel’s umbrella body, the Geneva-based International Air Transport Association (IATA) has welcomed the standard for commercial aircraft, produced by representatives at the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO). It took six years of negotiation and technical work before approval was granted by ICAO’s Committee on Aviation Environmental Protection. The standard does not solve aviation’s climate challenge on its own, IATA conceded, but was nevertheless an important element in a comprehensive strategy for tackling carbon emissions. “The next milestone will be the implementation of a market-based measure to address CO2 emissions, which we hope to see agreed at the ICAO Assembly in September,” the organisation said. The industry’s goal is carbon-neutral growth from 2020 and for a halving of CO2 emissions by 2050. The world’s other big aircraft manufacturer, Airbus, has also commended the CO2 agreement. The aim, the company said, was to reduce CO2 emissions from aviation by encouraging the integration of fuel-efficient technologies into aircraft design and development, ensuring older aircraft are replaced by newer, more efficient designs. This is part of a broader set of actions aimed at tackling aviation’s climate change impact including improvements in flight operations, deployment of sustainable jet fuels and the reduction of noise and other emissions together with the development of a global market based measure for aviation to be agreed at the ICAO General Assembly in October 2016. Airbus pointed out that it had invested significantly in improving the environmental performance of its sites, products and services. New aircraft coming to market would offer significantly reduced CO2 emissions and even the existing A380, in service since 2007, showed a 40 per cent reduction compared with previous-generation very large aircraft. Get set for an aviation boom More people, in more countries, are travelling by air. But we’re on the brink of an unprecedented boom. Data provided by Boeing show that, a little more than 20 years ago, about 1,5 trillion revenue passenger kilometres (RPK) were flown. Of that, nearly three-quarters was undertaken in Europe and North America. By 2014, total RPK had soared to six trillion. What’s note-worthy is that the Europe/North America travel more or less equally combined to make up only half the total. The other half was dominated by Asia (excluding China), with China next at about one-eighth of the total. By 2034, air travel will stand at 16 trillion RPK. Europe and North America’s share of that is estimated at 38 per cent, equal to China and the rest of Asia combined. According to a presentation by Boeing International’s managing director for Africa, J Miguel Santos, between now and 2034, airlines will need 38 000 new aircraft, valued at $5,6 trillion. By far the bulk of these will be standard single-aisle craft, which will account for 70 per cent. However, small and medium wide-body models will form a significant part of the total, accounting for between them 22 per cent. And who will be buying these planes? According to a Boeing estimate, nearly two out of every five will be destined for Asia. That’s as much as North America and Europe combined. Despite all that activity, aviation’s contribution to global greenhouse gases is minimal by comparison with terrestrial activities. As at 2010, according to a report from the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, aviation’s share was two per cent. Still, the industry is committed to carbon-neutral growth bu 2020. By 2050, it’s predicted, CO2 emissions will cut to half that of 2005. Boeing’s strategy for reducing emissions rests on three pillars: l More efficient aeroplanes l More efficient flight l Sustainable fuels. The most significant chunk of that, judging by a graphic indicating the company’s strategy, is sustainable fuels. What aviation needs, they say, is a drop-in biofuel that can be blended directly with petroleum jet fuel and meets or exceeds performance standards of petroleum – with no change to aircraft, engines or fuelling infrastructure.

David Pugliese, Ottawa Citizen More from David Pugliese, Ottawa Citizen Published on: September 18, 2016 | Last Updated: September 18, 2016 11:10 PM EST Share Adjust Comment Print If Lockheed Martin is worried about the potential of a legal challenge by Boeing over Denmark’s proposed purchase of the F-35, then the company isn’t showing it. Denmark rejected the Boeing Super Hornet and instead decided to purchase the same F-35 stealth fighter that Stephen Harper’s government originally wanted to buy. But Boeing says Denmark’s procurement process is flawed and has now submitted a “request for insight” which would require the country’s defence ministry to provide the data it used to select the F-35 over the Super Hornet. Boeing said this is the first stage for a formal legal challenge of the proposed F-35 purchase. But even if Boeing goes to court, can it stop a sovereign nation from buying a product it wants? In June, Denmark’s parliament approved the government’s recommendation to buy the F-35. Boeing might win in the courts and receive a determination that the procurement process was flawed. But how long would that take? And what if Denmark ignores the legal outcome and cites national security reasons to proceed on the acquisition since it needs an immediate replacement for its aging F-16s? The F-35As will be delivered between 2021 and 2026, Denmark says. Lockheed Martin will likely be moving quickly to acquire any long-lead items it needs for the aircraft and it is already positioning itself for industrial participation from Danish companies. It sent the following statement to Defence Watch: “Lockheed Martin respects the Danish government’s sovereign acquisition process and the outcome of the fighter replacement competition. We are confident the F-35 is the best choice for Denmark’s future defense needs. We will continue to support the post-decisional process and are now focused on executing the program, including industrial participation for Danish industry.”   RCAF squadrons, SAR Techs, civilian SAR personnel take part in major...

It projected a demand for 6,810 new airplanes in the country over the next two decades, estimating the total value of the new aircraft at $1.025 trillion. "As China transitions to a more consumer-based economy, aviation will play a key role in its economic development," Randy Tinseth, vice president of marketing with Boeing Commercial Airplanes, was quoted as saying in a company statement. With travel and transportation becoming key services, passenger traffic is expected to grow 6.4 percent annually in China over the coming 20 years, he said. China will need 5,110 new single-aisle airplanes through 2035, accounting for 75 percent of the total new deliveries, according to the statement. Driven by China's growing e-commerce business, air cargo is expected to become a key driver for the continuous growth of aviation in the country, with a need for 180 new freighters and 410 converted freighters in the future, said the statement. Globally, Boeing predicted investment of $5.9 trillion for 39,620 new commercial airplanes to be delivered during the next 20 years, with China accounting for 17 percent of the total in both value and number.

The country's national airline has provisionally agreed to buy U.S. and European aircraft worth over $50 billion at list prices, marking a high-profile test case for the reopening of its economy under a deal with world powers to ease sanctions. Nine months after the sanctions deal took effect, foreign banks are reluctant to get involved because of concerns that they could be caught up in restrictions applying to U.S. banks, which are still banned from doing business with Iran. Under the deal to lift nuclear-related sanctions, Iran can buy passenger planes and other goods but is not allowed to pay for them in dollars or to use the U.S. financial system, due to core U.S. sanctions that remain in force. The ban on paying in dollars is a particular headache for Boeing and international leasing companies, which usually account for their portfolios in the world's leading currency. Paying in other hard currencies could generate fleeting movements in the U.S. financial system known as U-Turn transactions, which are also banned. "We are negotiating and I hope that during the trip of President (Hassan) Rouhani to the U.S. today or tomorrow, we can have some news on the subject," Deputy Roads and Urban Development Minister Asghar Fakhrieh Kashan told foreign investors at the CAPA Iran Aviation Finance Summit in Tehran. IranAir Chairman Farhad Parvaresh is traveling to New York as part of Rouhani's delegation for the U.N. General Assembly. The United States has said it has no plans to reinstate "U-turn" authorization, which would allow foreign banks to use its financial system to transfer funds for some Iran-related trade. Iran wants to pay Boeing in dollars but failing such an agreement - which many observers consider unlikely - it wants the U.S. Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) to approve the financing as part of a separate process under which it must also grant licenses before jets can be exported to Iran. Industry sources say Boeing is talking to third-parties about handling the transactions and paying it in dollars, but is unlikely to proceed without clear guidance from Washington. EXPORT LICENSES Although it usually sells planes in dollars, France-based Airbus is expected to be paid in euros and would not need further permission to absorb the cash, industry sources said. However it does need the same U.S. export licenses as Boeing due to the high proportion of U.S. parts in its aircraft. Kashan said earlier he felt the U.S. Treasury export licenses for all of Iran's potential suppliers could be granted by end-September. Foreign banks, some of which have faced huge fines for breaking U.S. rules, are worried about financing the deals. "The problem for European banks is that we don't know the conditions under which OFAC will approve (the deals) and the second is that it is a question of reputation," Bertrand Grabowski, a managing director at Germany's DVB told Reuters. "Even if OFAC gives approval, what most of the big European banks fear, because they have great franchises in the U.S., is that there may be some fight-back in an unknown form and at an unknown time for the business they may have with Iran." Republicans who oppose the nuclear deal have warned against allowing Iran to use the dollar in business transactions. Lack of clarity over the currency regulations is also causing headaches for leasing companies which are expected to play a major role in Iran's fleet renewal by taking ownership of many of the jets and leasing them back to IranAir."If there are significant restrictions, that would be a real issue" said Firoz Tarapore, Chief Executive of Dubai Aerospace.

 One of Boeing's most important customers just said something very troubling Benjamin Zhang Sep. 18, 2016, 11:45 AM 33,412 facebook linkedin twitter email print A Norwegian Air Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner. Flickr/Eric Salard Norwegian Air is making waves in the airline industry. Recently, Norwegian Air Chief Commercial Officer Thomas Ramdahl told Business Insider in an interview his airline plans to launch $69 fares on trans-Atlantic flights starting next year. As a long-time Boeing customer, Norwegian selected the new generation 737 MAX 8 to launch the new fare. In fact, the airline, which currently operates a fleet made up exclusively of more than 100 Boeing jets, has 100 of the planes on order. But there's more to this story. Even though the 737 Max has a range of about 4,000 miles, there are routes where Norwegian will need greater range than the plane can deliver but won't require the services of a pricey wide-body jet. In other words, Norwegian is in need of a 'tweener. Traditionally, those routes have been the domain of Boeing's 757. However, Boeing discontinued the controversial plane in 2004 and still does not have an aircraft capable of matching its capabilities, although Boeing did tell Business Insider that it is currently studying the possibility of a 757 replacement. An Airbus A321neo LR. Airbus That's where the 30 A321neo LR jets Norwegian ordered from Boeing's arch rival, Airbus, come into play. "From the figures I've seen so far, the A321neo LR will have longer range than the MAX, so that gives us opportunities in smaller cities where frequency is more important than having a large wide-body jet," Ramdahl said. While some airlines are holding onto their aging fleets of 757s, Norwegian seems to believe that it may have found a worthy successor for the long-serving jet. "It's difficult to say yes or no, but I think so," Ramdahl told us when asked if the A321neo LR is a true replacement for the 757. "It's interesting to see if Boeing is coming up with a replacement for the 757 as well, because they'll need to if the LR does what Airbus is saying it will do." In fact, Ramdahl told us that the A321neo offers 10% to 15% lower costs per seat than a wide-body jet. Based on Airbus' projected range of more than 4,600 miles, the A321neo LR should be able to match or beat the 757's range, the Norwegian executive told Business Insider. In addition, Norwegian Air's A321's are expected to be equipped with 220 to 230 seats — which is on par with the capacity of the 757-200. A La Compagnie Boeing 757-200. La Compagnie This is potentially distressing news for Boeing. Even though the segment traditionally occupied by the 757 is not as large as the 737s or as profitable as the large wide-bodies, there is still plenty of demand for airplanes of its type. With the LR outselling its Boeing rival — the 737 MAX 9 — 5 to 1, it looks like Airbus is the only one with a truly competitive product on offer in the segment. And if a major, long-time customer like Norwegian is willing to defect, then it certainly stacks the deck against Boeing when it comes to drawing customers. The 737 MAX jets features new fuel-efficient CFM LEAP-1B engines, upgraded avionics, and aerodynamics. It's one of the most advanced and efficient airliners in the world. The A321neo LR also features upgraded avionics and aerodynamics but is equipped with a more powerful CFM LEAP-1A engine. However, Boeing is not in a position to simply bolt on larger engines to match the A321neo LR's range, because there is a direct correlation between the diameter of a turbofan engine's fan blades and the amount of thrust the engine can produce. For example, the more powerful 1A engine's fan blades have a diameter of 78 inches — 9 more than the 1B. A Norwegian Boeing 737 MAX 8. Boeing An upgrade to a larger engine will likely involve a redesign of the 737's landing gear. That's because the 737 was designed in the 1960s to be powered by Pratt & Whitney's JT8D engine with a much more compact fan diameter of 49 inches. Since then, Boeing has been bolting larger and larger engines onto the 737, but the under-wing space has not changed. The 737 has essentially maxed out on the engine size that can fit under its wings. As a result, Boeing will have to raise and relocate the plane's landing gear. This means that whether it decides to modify the 737 or to build a new plane from scratch, it'll be a move that will likely cost billions. Norwegian expects to take delivery of its 737 MAX 8 in 2017, with the first A321neo LR expected in 2019.

PetroTalk Infogram Docs فارسی French فارسی French Iran says US to OK its plane purchases Sun Sep 18, 2016 1:7PM Home Iran Economy Iran says it expects the US Treasury to approve sales of planes by aviation including giants Airbus and Boeing to the country by the end of September. Iran says it has been told that the US Treasury Department will approve licenses for global aviation giants such as Airbus and Boeing to export planes to the country within the next weeks. "Today we are expecting that (approval) by the end of September for Boeing, Airbus and ATR," Iran’s Deputy Roads and Urban Development Minister Asghar Fakhrieh Kashan told the CAPA Iran Aviation Finance Summit in Tehran. Fakhrieh Kashan emphasized that the Treasury approval was expected to be issues by the end of August and warned that any failure by the US to approve the licenses would breach a nuclear deal that Iran sealed with the P5+1 group of countries – the five permanent members of the UN Security Council plus Germany – last year.  On a related front, Iran’s Roads and Urban Development Minister Abbas Akhoundi told reporters that Tehran the Islamic Republic hopes that the US Treasury would soon move to facilitate purchases of planes by the country.  Akhoundi further emphasized that the strong participation by aviation companies in the CAPA event shows that all businesses in this industry want the US to move ahead with approving sales of planes to Iran.       The Iranian minister further emphasized that Tehran has no problems in providing the required funds for its planned purchases of planes.  He added that the country is ready to proceed with other aviation companies over purchases of planes.  Any new negotiation with the companies, Akhoundi emphasized, will nonetheless depend on a much-delayed move by the US Treasury to lift restrictions in dealing with the Islamic Republic.    Loading ...

Iran is urging the US to remove obstacles to its purchase of passenger planes. Photograph: Vahid Salemi/AP Reuters in Tehran Sunday 18 September 2016 09.29 EDT Last modified on Friday 11 November 2016 06.32 EST Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email View more sharing options Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Close This article is 2 months old Iran urged the US on Sunday to remove remaining obstacles to its ability to buy passenger planes, following the lifting of international sanctions, and it spread out the welcome mat to foreign investors as it seeks to boost its aviation sector. Iran provisionally agreed earlier this year to buy more than 200 jets worth $50bn at list prices from Airbus and Boeing under an agreement between Tehran and world powers to ease sanctions in exchange for curbs on Iran’s nuclear activities. Both deals hinge on the longer-than-expected process of winning US treasury approval, which is needed due to the high proportion of US parts in virtually all modern jetliners, including those made by Europe’s Airbus. There have also been delays in getting European banks to finance the deals because of restrictions over the use of US dollars and concerns over legal risks if sanctions are reimposed. West failing to deliver nuclear deal promises, says Iran vice-president Read more Roads and urban development minister Abbas Akhoundi told an aviation conference that Iran was complying with its obligations and meanwhile continued to negotiate with other plane makers. “We are negotiating with all those big names … There are a lot of obstacles but I am sure that because we have respected all the international rules and regulations, all those problems are going to be resolved,” he told the CAPA Aviation Finance Summit, the second large gathering of aviation leaders in Tehran since sanctions were lifted in January. Critics in Congress argue that Iran could use passenger jets for military purposes such as transporting fighters to battle US troops or allies in Syria or transfer the aircraft to airlines still under US sanctions. US critics of the nuclear deal also say it could allow Iran to skirt remaining sanctions by transferring jets acquired by national carrier IranAir to airlines that remain on a US blacklist, such as the country’s largest carrier, Mahan Air. In an interview with Reuters, Akhoundi dismissed the concerns. “We have a contract. We will stick to it,” he said. He also told a news conference that the Tehran event, attended by dozens of foreign firms, proved that aviation was international in scope and “the US government cannot stand against it”, according to a translation of his remarks. The House of Representatives in July passed two amendments that would stop the aircraft sales, although to become law they need to be approved by the Senate and signed by Barack Obama. Iran estimates it will need at least 400 aircraft to renew and expand its fleet, including some 250 in the next 10 years. Besides the aircraft sales, Iran is dangling the prospect of significant business for western companies including nationwide airport expansion as it emerges from decades of sanctions. “There are more than 60 airports in Iran, but 80% of flights are in just 10 and these are working beyond capacity; that is why we need to develop,” Akhoundi said. “They are all ready to attract investors, who are welcome to invest in any part,” he told the conference held at Tehran’s Imam Khomeini airport, which plans a $2.8bn expansion.

McIntyre September 18, 2016 8:59 am EST Print Email Tweet Boeing Co. (NYSE: BA), humbled by competition from Airbus, financial results that have not met expectations, fraud accusations and mechanical problems with one of its planes, has had a share price of 12.37% this year, the largest drop of any Dow Jones Industrial Average component. Its current share price is $126.71. The Dow has moved the other direction. It has risen 4.01% to 18,123.80. Twenty of the 30 Dow stocks are higher this year. Among Boeing’s troubles is its disclosure of a large drop in its earnings forecast. According to MarketWatch, [T]he aircraft maker warned second-quarter charges will reach $2.05 billion, stemming from setbacks and difficulties in three separate programs and including problems related to weaker air-cargo market trends. In its 787 program, Boeing decided not to invest funds for the refurbishment and sale of the two remaining unsold flight test aircraft. The costs associated with these aircraft were reclassified to research and development expenses, resulting in a non-cash after-tax charge of $847 million, Boeing said in a statement. Moreover, due to “current and anticipated weakness” in the air-cargo market, Boeing will no longer increase the production rate of its 747-8 aircraft in 2019, resulting in a $814 million after-tax charge, also reflecting lower estimated revenues on future aircraft sales. The company will also recognize a $393 million after-tax charge related to its KC-46 Tanker program, to account for higher costs associated with the previously announced program schedule and technical challenges, Boeing said. Boeing will update its 2017 guidance when it reports second-quarter earnings on July 27, the company said. Although earnings beat expectations, the numbers from the most recent quarter were poor. Revenue was up only 1% to $24.8 billion. The company posted a net loss of $234 million, compared to a profit of $1.1 billion in the same quarter a year ago. If orders, earnings and revenue do not rise soon, Boeing could be at the bottom of the Dow list at year end. I'm interested in the Newsletter Get Newsletter terms and conditions   By Douglas A.

Photo / Mike Kane The smallest aircraft made by Boeing and Airbus Group are about to find a new role operating trans-Atlantic routes that were previously the preserve of some of the world's biggest planes. The re-engined 737 Max and A320neo jets offer a 15 per cent fuel saving meant to cut costs on the shortest inter-city services. At the same time the revamp has added about 500 miles to their range -- just enough to allow the narrow-bodies to span the 3,000 miles between the eastern US and Western Europe. While eight hours on a 130-foot plane with three toilets and one gangway might not immediately appeal to travelers used to the spacious cabins of an Airbus A380, airlines say the smaller jets will open up direct routes that wouldn't otherwise be viable. That would do away with the need to switch between flights at a busy hub. At the same time people can look forward to competitive fares as carriers seek out smaller airports where access charges are lower. Norwegian Air Shuttle, JetBlue Airways and Portugal's TAP are among airlines buying the jets for trans-Atlantic routes, with NAS set to lead the way when it becomes one of the first carriers to get Boeing's Max 8 next year. Its initial flights may link Edinburgh, Birmingham in England and Cork and Shannon in Ireland to smaller airports in New England and the New York area. "The Max is very competitive," Norwegian Air Chief Executive Officer Bjorn Kjos said in an interview in London. "It has huge potential from the smaller cities along the Atlantic coast. But you can't go into New York as you do with wide-bodies. You must target airports with a totally different cost structure." Boeing's 757, the world's longest single-aisle airliner with around 200 seats and a range in excess of 4,000 miles, has been plying the Atlantic for years, with companies including United Continental Holdings Inc. still deploying the model on routes such as Newark, New Jersey, to Birmingham, England. Continued below. Related Content Cartoon: Uncle Sam is 'well and truly impaled' The best workplace in New Zealand named Meet New Zealand's youngest politician and high school drop-out Production ceased in 2004, however, leaving those 757s still flying in the twilight of their lives and with fuel consumption way in excess of modern jets. The 737 and A320, by contrast, were designed for much shorter flights, with the original 737-100 seating just 85 people and limited to trips of about 1,200 miles. While ranges have increased, the 3,300-mile reach of the 737-800 and -900 is insufficient for fully laden operations on trans-Atlantic routes where jets must carry enough reserve fuel to fly about 500 miles in an emergency. A handful of carriers operate services at reduced capacity, which cuts the weight of a plane and increases its range, with SAS serving Boston from Copenhagen using an 86-seat 737-700 and British Airways connecting London City airport and New York with an Airbus A318 carrying just 32 passengers. It has huge potential from the smaller cities along the Atlantic coast. But you can't go into New York as you do with wide-bodies. You must target airports with a totally different cost structure. The only current trans-Atlantic 737 or A320 services with a near-normal load are flown by Canada's WestJet Airlines and link St. John's, Newfoundland, with Dublin -- distance 2,000 miles -- and Halifax, Nova Scotia, with Glasgow in Scotland. The 737-700s used have 136 seats. The UK and Irish routes planned for Norwegian's 189-seat Max 8s will span about 3,000 miles. Subsequent flights could serve Stavanger, Trondheim and Bergen in Norway and Aalborg in Denmark, though they'll likely involve a long-range version of Airbus's A321neo known as the LR and able to fly more than 4,000 miles using extra fuel tanks, spokesman Lasse Sandaker-Nielsen said. Norwegian ordered 30 of the planes with 220 seats in a single class in July. JetBlue and TAP also plan to deploy the model, which is due to be available from 2019. The U.S. carrier has agreed to buy 30 A321neos with an option to take some as LR variants, saying it wants an aircraft with "trans-Atlantic range." TAP has orders for 10 A321neoLRs, saying it could use them to serve Brazil and possibly the US. For the moment we haven't really got the planes out there. Its Lisbon base is about 3,500 miles from both New York and Recife, the South American country's sixth-largest city.Ireland's Aer Lingus is also a likely operator of the A321neoLR across the Atlantic, Willie Walsh, CEO of parent company IAG SA, said in July, adding that the jet represents a "fantastic opportunity." It already flies 757s to locations including Hartford, Connecticut, typical of the cities smaller planes could serve. With the LR emerging as a favored successor to the 757, Boeing is studying designs for a stretch of its biggest Max 9 -- dubbed the Max 10 -- that would offer much of the range and payload of the A321 and could be ready by the decade's end, or a more elaborate revamp using the larger engines developed for the Airbus jet. It's also working on a new family of mid-range aircraft that would debut about five years later, CEO Dennis Muilenburg said Wednesday. Whatever the outcome, passengers seem certain to be making longer trips on the smallest class of jetliners in coming years. "For the moment we haven't really got the planes out there," said Yan Derocles, an analyst at Oddo Securites in Paris. "But they're coming."

(Photo: Michael Kappeler/DPA /Newscom) Commentary By Diane Katz / @Dianeskatz Diane Katz, who has analyzed and written on public policy issues for more than two decades, is a research fellow in regulatory policy at The Heritage Foundation. Read her research. Let’s put two and two together, shall we? For more than a year now, the U.S. Export-Import Bank has been limited to financing export deals of less than $10 million—a real hardship, evidently, for Ex-Im President Fred P. Hochberg and his buds who much prefer subsidies in the high nine digits for multinational corporations and foreign governments. Alas, the bank charter requires that those big-dollar deals win approval from three members of the five-member board, which is a no-go these days, with only two board seats presently occupied. On the upside, that leaves Ex-Im personnel more time to oversee the $102 billion in taxpayer-backed subsidies outstanding. These include a $5 billion loan to Sadara Chemical Co., a joint venture between Saudi Arabia, with a world’s top 10 gross domestic product of $1.6 trillion, and Dow Chemical Co., market cap $59.5 billion. Meanwhile, after months of relative quiet on Capitol Hill, the Ex-Im issue has popped up front and center in congressional negotiations over a spending bill to keep the government running after Sept. 30. The cronies are lobbying like there is no tomorrow for an appropriations “rider” that would quash the requirement that the Ex-Im board have a quorum of three (out of the five seats) in order to approve deals larger than $10 million. To do so would be bad policy. The quorum ensures that no one person controls the billions of dollars in loans and loan guarantees doled out by the bank each year. That’s the very essence of America’s system of checks and balances. Such a procedural stunt also would circumvent the legislative process that contributes to a full consideration of major policy change, and also override the Senate Banking Committee, which otherwise has jurisdiction over confirmations of Ex-Im board members. Bank advocates such as Thomas Donohue, president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, insist that Ex-Im’s more generous subsidies are “vital to American businesses and their supply chains trying to compete in a fierce global economy.” That’s a stretch. Ex-Im transactions benefit a mere 2 percent of U.S. exports and, until this year, overwhelmingly profited just a few multinational corporations. And speaking of Iran: This latest effort to override Ex-Im’s charter just happens to coincide with news from Tehran that the Iranian government expects the U.S. Treasury to grant licenses by month’s end for Boeing Co. to sell the Islamic regime, the world’s foremost sponsor of state terrorism, a fleet of new jets. The $17.6 billion deal between the aviation giant and Iran was made possible by President Barack Obama’s lifting of economic sanctions against Tehran in January. Under terms of a memorandum of agreement, Boeing reportedly will supply 80 planes—including intercontinental jumbo jets—to state-owned Iran Air. Financing for the purchase has not been announced. Boeing (market cap $86 billion) long has been the principal beneficiary of Ex-Im largesse—until the bank lost its board quorum. But in fiscal year 2014 alone, the bank supplied more than $5.6 billion in taxpayer-backed loans and loan guarantees to foreign airlines on Boeing’s behalf, including: • $842 million to Kenya Airways. • $139 million to Virgin Australia Airlines. • $277 million to Biman Bangladesh Airlines. • $454 million to Air Canada. • $292 million to China Southern Airlines. • $734 million to Air China Cargo. • $424 million to Air China. • $296 million to Ethiopian Airlines. • $496 million to Korean Airlines. • $194 to Norwegian Air Shuttle. • $703 million to Russia’s Vnesheconombank Leasing JSC. • $497 million to Thai Airways International Ltd. • $284 million to Emirates Airline. All that taxpayer-backed financing for a single company, amounting to half of the total awarded during the entire year. And that’s exactly the type of crony deal-making that is driving the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National Association of Manufacturers, and a bunch of other special interests to demand that Congress overrun the bank charter. The charter they all endorsed just nine months ago. But now the special interests are chafing under the charter constraints that limit the size of Ex-Im subsidies. Those constraints interfere, for example, with deals as big as Boeing’s pending fleet sale to Iran’s terrorist regime. The Daily Signal depends on the support of readers like you.

Friday November 18, 2016 Analysis Argentina Community Economy World Culture Media Sports English on the Side   Number of Locals travelling to giant neighbour expected to rise sharply this summer Monday, September 19, 2016 Air travel shows signs of recovery as flights with Brazil take off Gol workers inspect a Boeing 737 aircraft at the firm’s maintenance centre at the Tancredo Neves International Airport in Confins, Minas Gerais, Brazil in this Thursday, September 15 picture. By Ignacio Portes Herald Staff Flights between Argentina and Brazil set to increase this summer as more firms target local market Argentina and Brazil might both be struggling with recessions, with bilateral trade between the two plunging dramatically over the last two years, but the market for air travel between the two Mercosur members is showing signs of recovery. After years of cutting costs amid falling demand, one of Brazil’s biggest airlines, Gol — which is partnered with Argentina’s state-owned Aerolíneas — says the number of extra flights this summer is expected to double compared to the 2015-2016 season. And it is Argentines who are leading the way, with the country’s travellers to Brazil outnumbering the Brazilians visiting Argentina for the first time in years, bucking a history of predominantly inverted flows. “Argentina’s number one destination is Brazil and Brazil’s is Argentina. And there’s a particular twist to that today, which is that Argentines are travelling more to Brazil than the other way round,” Gol’s Director of Institutional Relations Alberto Fajerman told the Herald. “Firstly because it’s a great destination, then because of the end of restrictions to purchase foreign currency, and finally because the real had a bigger devaluation than other currencies on the continent, and that turned Brazil into a reasonably economical destination.” Summers are always a period of increased demand, with firms adding special flights (be them chartered or sold on an individual basis) to cover for rising tourism, but despite two consecutive years of recession in Brazil and a 2016 of plunging purchasing power in Argentina, Gol said it was expecting roughly 250 extra flights when compared to nearly 125 a year ago. Asked if they do this because they expect more demand or if its the result of a special policy aimed at capturing a larger share of the market despite a stalled economy, another source close to Gol said that “the company would not move like this if it wasn’t expecting a positive response from the market.” The firm’s outlook for the Argentina-Brazil market is significant as roughly a third of those flights are covered by Gol, a figure which rises comfortably above 50 percent if its partner Aerolíneas Argentinas is included in the calculations. The news comes shortly after other foreign airlines made moves to expand in Argentina, with Colombia’s giant Avianca buying the small local firm MacAir in March and Ireland’s low-cost Ryanair also suggesting it could enter the local market. Cost saving Gol is also sometimes seen as a low-cost airline too, as the firm emphasizes flying on standarized planes to simplify operations, and even uses the lightest paint possible in order to reduce fuel costs. It was cost-saving that kept the firm afloat throughout the past few years, the firm’s spokesman said. “It is a difficult market. Business travellers have gone down from 60 percent of tickets sold to 50 percent, with leisure travellers, who usually pay less, growing in proportion. So each flight is producing reduced yields too. Our answer has been to cut costs so as to mantain margins,” Fajerman said, although repeatedly stating that this was not done at the expense of security measures. He was speaking after an event on the 10-year anniversary of Gol’s maintenance centre in Confins, Minas Gerais, the biggest in Latin America. Technicians for the company there said that they could use the facilities to fix planes from other firms, including Aerolíneas, but that this was more of an informal arrangement on an individual basis and not part of a wider agreement. With the United States’ Federal Aviation Administration authorizing the centre to repair US planes, the firm could now also use it for an additional profit stream. Changes in the market Historically, Brazilians have accounted for “two thirds or more” of the bilateral air travel between both countries, down to 55 percent “in good times,” but not frequently. Now, the market seems to be changing. Brazil, whose currency the real strengthened for years allowing for more travel abroad, has now gotten cheaper for foreign tourists going there. And while Argentina also devalued recently when the clamp on foreign currency trade was lifted in December, capital inflows are expected to keep the peso strong over the next few years, meaning that travel abroad will remain relatively affordable when compared to internal tourism. While purchasing power for the working person has fallen significantly in both countries as of late, the business sector, whose influence in air travel is strong, has gotten more optimistic after a couple of years of decline with the rise of market-friendly governments. Gol, Tam, Latam and Azul, the biggest carriers in Brazil, got rid of 60 planes over the last two years to reduce costs by downsizing their fleet. Now, they expect a timid recovery. Fajerman also hinted at a strategy targeting new destinations, adding direct flights from Buenos Aires to Manaos following the success of others to Fortaleza, Recife and Natal, while he said they also wanted to encourage Brazilians to visit cities outside of Buenos Aires, Córdoba and Mendoza, the typical three destinations for them. Formally, however, a bilateral agreement means that there is a weekly limit of slots for regular flights between Argentina and Brazil, which is unlikely to be expanded until Argentine firms sell their share in full, something which Gol is already doing. Only in the summer does this figure grow as an exception to keep the additional demand in check. “We are not adding regular flights because we are occupying the 76 slots we are assigned per week. We are shifting flights from one destination to another to keep demand satisfied,” Gol said. Outlook for the region As for other expansion plans, Fajerman said that it was only natural to think about focusing on Latin America due to the firm’s policy of only using Boeing models whose fuel capacity limits them to medium-distance travel. “We want to go to Peru next, then maybe Colombia,” he forecasted. “Sadly, we have suspended flights to Venezuela. Not for political reasons, but because of commercial problems, with exchange rates, access to dollars, that have meant that flights at the moment cannot be justified. But it is still a fantastic market that we know will come back, just as Brazil,” the director said. @ignacioportes Size email Print Share Vote Tweets por @BAHeraldcom Get to File LATEST NEWS MOST POPULAR BEST RANKED Photo of the week Macri meets with Canada’s Trudeau: 'We seek to enhance trade relations' Yellen says Fed could raise interest rates 'relatively soon' Gov't says income tax changes to be retrospective Trump shuffles transition team, eyes loyalists for Cabinet                     Edition No. 5015 - This publication is a property of NEFIR S.A. -RNPI Nº 5293935 - Issn 1852 - 9224 - Te. 4349-1500 - San Juan 141 , (C1063ACY) CABA

Argentina: Aerolineas Argentinas faces a tough turnaround with government's new liberal mindset CAPA > Aviation Analysis > Argentina: Aerolineas Argentinas faces a tough turnaround with government's new liberal mindset 19-Sep-2016 Tweet © CAPA A new liberalised mindset emerging in Argentina has drawn the attention of Latin American airline groups looking to capitalise on new opportunities in the country’s historically closed-off domestic aviation market. Avianca’s major shareholder Synergy Group is aiming to launch a new domestic airline in Argentina, and the Viva Group is also eying establishing a new airline in the country after abandoning plans to launch its third low cost carrier in Costa Rica. At the same time, Argentina’s state-owned flag carrier Aerolineas Argentinas is attempting to transition to a more commercially minded airline after years of bleeding cash and being propped by the former Argentinian government. The airline is aiming to become solvent by 2018, but formidable challenges lie ahead for Aerolineas in reaching that goal, evidenced by the airline’s pilots recently resorting to a familiar tactic – staging a strike. Argentina’s pledge for a more liberalised aviation market is a welcome change, but obstacles loom large for the country’s largest airline and prospective start-ups as the government still regulates domestic fares, and infrastructure costs remain high. Still, a move toward liberalisation in one of Latin America’s most closed-off markets could be one of the most important developments in the region’s aviation industry in the medium to long term. Aerolineas Argentinas faces an uphill climb to achieving financial stability After Argentina’s current president Mauricio Macri was elected in late 2015, his new government made several overtures toward liberalisation, and stated its objective to double domestic air traffic over the next four years, after growing 60% from 2011 to 2015. See related report: Argentina Aviation Part 2: Aerolineas Argentinas is pressured as competition intensifies Aerolineas remains a government-controlled entity, but a new president is attempting to transform the airline into a viable commercial enterprise. The company has not released a balance sheet update since 2013, when it lost USD247 million on USD2 billion of revenue. Argentina’s government has outlined plans to cut subsidies to the airline; in fact, Aerolineas president Isela Costantini has been quoted in the press with the statement that in assuming leadership at the airline she has inherited a fleet of unpaid aircraft and high levels of debt. Aerolineas has 53 aircraft in its operating fleet and 21 on order.  Aerolineas Argentinas fleet summary, as of 18-Sep-2016 Aircraft In Service Inactive On Order* Total: 53 1 21 Airbus A330-200 8 0 1 Airbus A340-300 0 1 0 Airbus A340-300X 6 0 0 Boeing 737-700 16 0 0 Boeing 737-800 23 0 20 Source: CAPA Fleet Database Orders include those placed directly by the operator and by lessors assigned to the operator, from 18-Sep-2016 onwards. CAPA’s Fleet Database indicates that Aerolineas has 10 Boeing 737-800s scheduled for delivery in 2017, followed by five additional deliveries in 2018. Aerolineas Argentinas projected delivery dates for aircraft purchased from OEMs and leased from lessors, as of 18-Sep-2016 Source: CAPA Fleet Database Aircraft operated by subsidiaries/associates of the main airline may be listed separately. Firm orders include those placed directly by the operator and by lessors assigned to the operator, from 19-Sep-2016 onwards. Excludes aircraft for which the delivery date has not been announced, cannot be reasonably projected or is unlikely to be delivered. According to local news outlets, Aerolineas could post a USD1 billion loss for 2016. Ms Costantini has a stated goal of making the airline solvent by 2018; achieving that target entails slashing costs, cutting staff, and finding viable aircraft financing. Aerolineas recently took delivery of the first of two A330-200s from the aircraft lessor Aircastle, and Ms Costantini has highlighted the "unprecedented conditions" reached on the aircraft. With the onset of A350 widebodies leasing rates for the A330s are obviously favourable, but given Aerolineas credit profile – the airline’s suppliers and lessors are assuming considerable risks. Aerolineas did secure a 10.5 year, USD280 million loan from GE Capital Aviation Services in Aug-2016, secured by four A330-200s with GE engines and three 737-800s. During 2015 Aerolineas has USD110 million in debt to Boeing, which swelled to USD200 million in 2016. As the former GM executive Ms Costantini works to reconcile Aerolineas’ tangled and complex web of finances, labour unrest has once again surfaced at the airline. In mid-Sep-2016 pilots staged a strike, triggering the cancellation of dozens of flights. The airline’s pilots resorted to striking after failing to reach an agreement with Aerolineas’ management on wages. Aerolineas faces a wildcat strike as it works to bolster its leading domestic position The timing of any strike action for an airline is ill-fated, but Aerolineas is in the process of expanding domestically and the cancellations due to the strike do not engender a lot of confidence among passengers in a country where long haul luxury bus travel remains popular. Aerolineas has undertaken domestic expansion at the same time as the country’s new government has outlined plans to double domestic traffic during the next four years. As previously reported by CAPA, Aerolineas’ weekly domestic seats in Nov-2016 will grow 15% year-on-year, coinciding with the summer season of the Southern Hemisphere that begins in Oct-2016. Starting in Oct-2016 Aerolineas is adding frequencies to several markets, and introducing flights from La Rioja to Catamarca and El Calafate to Bariloche. Data from CAPA and OAG show that Aerolineas’ domestic seats are projected to rise in early 2016, growing 11% year-on-year for the first week of Jan-2017.

Argentina domestic capacity by airline (% of seats): 2-Jan-2017 to 8-Jan-2017 Source: CAPA - Centre for Aviation and OAG The small charter and business jet operator MacAir Jet will represent a fraction of Argentina’s domestic seats in early Jan-2017, but changes are under way at the operator after it was acquired by Avianca Holdings’ major shareholder Synergy. Synergy plans to transform MacAir Jet into a scheduled turboprop operator with a base at Cordoba, Aerolineas’ second largest domestic base measured by seat deployment. However, Aerolineas’ deploys more than four times more seats from its largest domestic base at Buenos Aires Aeroparque. Aerolineas has expanded from Cordoba ahead of the establishment of Synergy’s new airline at the airport, growing from nine point-to-point domestic routes from the airport in Jun-2016 to 13 in Sep-2016. Aerolineas Argentinas top 10 domestic hubs/bases/stations by seats: 19-Sep-2016 to 25-Sep-2016 Source: CAPA - Centre for Aviation and OAG. Aerolineas is clearly attempting to strengthen its network breadth in Argentina’s domestic market ahead of the establishment of new competitors, with Synergy being the greatest near-term threat. At one point Synergy aimed to launch the new airline by YE2016, but it is not clear if the company will meet that targeted start date. The Viva Group has also expressed an interest in establishing its third LCC in Latin America in Argentina and has met with Argentinian government officials about doing so, but Viva has yet to outline any definitive plans for entering the Argentinian market. LATAM Argentina is also likely to resume expansion in Argentina after being hamstrung from expanding by the previous government, in order to protect Aerolineas. But conditions also need to be favourable for LATAM Argentina’s expansion. Domestic fares are low, on average, and regulated by the government, while airport and other fixed costs are high. Those dynamics, along with Argentina’s weak economy, which is forecast to contract by 1% in 2016, create some challenges in operating profitably in Argentina’s domestic market. Yet the chance to inject true low cost competition in one of the few remaining markets without a true low cost airline is an opportunity not to be overlooked – if a prospective airline can achieve a cost profile that allows for the stimulation of traffic through lower fares. There should be more options for Argentinians than just a dominant flag carrier, one that is undertaking a painful transformation to a more legitimate and accountable commercial entity. After years of constraint, Argentina is now one of Latin America's most interesting markets The move toward a more liberalised aviation business within and to and from Argentina is a welcome sign for one of the few remaining countries without a true low cost airline, and for Latin America overall. Despite the current economic weakness stubbornly hanging over the region opportunities remain to stimulate some of Latin America’s domestic markets with the low cost model, if governments recognise the value of increased competition. Argentina appears to be taking positive steps in that direction. A real test for Argentina’s government is adhering to its pledge of lowering the subsidies that Aerolineas Argentinas receives, in order for the airline to transition to a competitive entity that operates with a new level of fiscal responsibility. Each changing dynamic will take some time to reach fruition, resulting in Argentina emerging as one of Latin America’ most interesting markets during the next few years. Want more analysis like this?

Argentina Aviation Part 2: Aerolineas Argentinas pressured as competition intensifies 30-Jun-2016 Argentina’s domestic market is poised for more rapid domestic growth driven by further expansion at Aerolineas Argentinas and intensifying competition. Aerolineas has focused primarily on domestic expansion since its renationalisation in 2008 and continues to grow its domestic fleet. Argentina’s domestic market grew by approximately 60% from 2011 to 2015, driven entirely from expansion at the Aerolineas Argentinas Group. Competition during this period was limited by the restrictive and protectionist policies of the previous government, enabling Aerolineas to increase its market share without having to fend off expansion from its local rival LATAM Argentina, or potential start-ups. Under the more liberal policies of Argentina’s new government, LATAM Argentina is now free to expand. New airlines are also able to launch, starting with a regional start-up backed by Avianca parent Synergy and a potential new affiliate of the Latin American LCC group Viva. Aerolineas is responding to the prospect of new competition by pursuing more domestic expansion. Avianca airline group: bracing for changing Colombian market as Latin America starts to recover 14-Nov-2016 Latin American airline group Avianca Holdings is welcoming continued improving trends in the region, which started to emerge in 2Q2016 and appear to be gaining strength in 2H2016. The company’s yield decreases slowed year-on-year in 3Q2016 to the single digits, and Avianca posted a rise in yields sequentially from 2Q2016 to 3Q2016. Avianca’s optimism rests on robust load factors, particularly on long haul routes from its largest market – Colombia –to the US and Europe. Demand is also picking up in South America as travellers adjust to the effects of currency depreciation that, while improving, have become a mainstay in many markets in the region. Avianca’s booking trends for Nov-2016 and Dec-2016 indicate that positive momentum is continuing into 4Q2016. The company faces changing dynamics in its largest market Colombia in late 2016 when Copa Airlines shifts its business model in the country to a low cost operation in order to compete more effectively. Avianca seems unconcerned about Copa’s change in strategy, citing its strong position in Colombia despite increased competition arising in the country’s domestic market during the last few years. Colombia’s market should undergo further changes in 2017 when LATAM Airlines Group begins instituting a new pricing model in its domestic markets, including in Colombia. © 2016 CAPA Centre for Aviation :: Contact Us :: Terms & Conditions :: Cookies & Privacy Policy :: Glossary :: Feedback :: All times are in AEST (GMT +11)

The story of how this was done not only proves that the Clintons are behind the loss of American jobs, but shows how Bill Clinton established a Democratic strategy for manipulating foreign policy that was copied by both Hillary while she was Secretary of State and Obama while he was president. At the time, U.S.-China trade relations were conditioned upon China’s humanitarian treatment of its own citizens. Americans had seen protesters in Tiananmen Square crushed by Chinese tanks. The brutality of the Chinese toward unarmed protesters had shocked Americans so much that China was required to treat its citizens in a humanitarian way in order to maintain its MFN (Most Favored Nation) status. China desperately needed to keep its MFN status for one reason: only with MFN status could it get a huge discount on tariffs it had to pay to the U.S. With MFN Chinese manufacturers only had to pay a 6% tariff. Without it they would have had to pay an unprofitable 40%. So without its MFN status China couldn’t as easily compete with American manufacturers. China’s MFN status was suspended during the Korean War, but conditionally reinstated in 1980 under the Jackson-Vanir freedom of emigration amendment to the Trade Act of 1974. This is where Bill Clinton stepped in. With his 1993 Executive Order, he unconstitutionally seized control of the MFN conditions, removing it from the involvement of Congress, just as Obama seized treaty control away from the Senate with his Iranian nuke deal. Clinton’s Executive Order was issued at a time when the U.S.-China trade deficit was only $18 billion a year. In 2015 the deficit was $367 billion. It’s important to understand that at the time China’s MFN status was annually up for review by Congress. The effective law was passed in 1974. What Bill Clinton did, with an unconstitutional Executive Order, was to use “the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States” to rewrite a Congressionally approved treaty and change the terms. The way he changed it is eerily similar to the way Hillary practiced State Department decisions when she was Secretary of State from 2009 to 2012. Bill Clinton intentionally, with great harm to jobs in the U.S., changed the terms of the law in this way: instead of requiring a vote of Congress to reaffirm China’s MFN status every year, Bill Clinton illegally shifted the decision-making role to the Secretary of State. This eliminated the power of Congress to approve the annual MFN status. President Clinton, in his 1993 statement, said this was necessary to avoid the “annual battles between Congress and the Executive” which was divisive. Of course it was divisive -- the Framers of the Constitution intended it to be so. Without the input of the elected members of Congress the people had no say. Similarly, Hillary Clinton used her position as Sec. of State to personally approve/disapprove many agreements. President Obama was to emulate this shifting of foreign policy making to bureaucrats in 2015 with his so-called Iranian “deal.” An agreement with a foreign nation is a treaty, not a deal. This is because the authority of the U.S. government is used to both make the treaty and adhere to its terms. The Constitution properly gives the people, working through the Senate, the opportunity to have a voice in the terms of the treaty. Bill Clinton, Hillary, and Obama all stole this input from the voters and placed it under their control. And just as the Clinton Foundation has been linked to relationships Hillary had to her speech payers and donors, Bill Clinton’s decision to send jobs to China by permanently controlling its MFN status has been linked to campaign donations. Boeing Company wanted the EO. Boeing was the parent company of the Loral Corporation, which donated $100,000 to the Democratic National Committee in June, 1994, according to a Washington Post report at the time. A nice reward to Clinton for his MFN status change. The Loral Corporation is a major developer of missile flight control software and at the time they wanted to launch satellites from China. Boeing also owned McDonnell-Douglas which in 1994 made an agreement with China to open a parts factory in Beijing. If this all seems oddly similar to the deals Hillary made with foundation campaign donors, well, that’s because it is. While Bill Clinton made this deal through an Executive Order, it’s important to note that there are other developments which have evolved from the EO. The Clinton Foundation is legally located in Canada, allowing the Clintons to hide the identities of their donors. They also used the foundation as a method of obtaining payment for delivering unprecedentedly expensive speeches. In return, it appears that Hillary allowed donors access to her office and granted State Department permission on numerous foreign trade deals. Since these agreements and deals were made through email the Clinton email scandal is seen as an effort to hide the pay for play evidence. In 2001 Boeing got a $63 million dollar incentive “deal” from the Democratic mayor of Chicago to relocate its headquarters there. These incentives will likely be paid for, in typical Democratic Party style, by the middle-class and poor taxpayers who will have to make up that $63 million through their own family’s budgets. Boeing only brought 500 jobs to the city, costing taxpayers $126,000 per job. This, like the Chinese MFN Executive Order, promoted as a good investment for the city. When all of these actions are thoroughly investigated, these deals will reveal that the Democratic Party’s globalization initiative is mostly a scheme to get rich by trading U.S. governmental authority, and American jobs, to enrich a tiny number of people. As the Clintons and Obama get richer the American people lose jobs and become poorer. Those are facts. This is primarily done by shifting the authority of government. Bill Clinton bestowed the authority to reauthorize China’s MFN status to the Secretary of State. Hillary Clinton bestowed upon herself the authority to negotiate with companies with foreign interests and the foreign nations themselves. And Barack Obama seized the power of Federal agencies through his 32 czars, bypassing the restraints imposed by the Constitution. The basic strategy is to shift authority, then control that newly created authority, bypassing the role of Congress.  It’s only just begun. Voters can decide if they want to see more unrestrained power brokering by Hillary.

Iran provisionally agreed earlier this year to buy over 200 jets worth $50 billion at list prices from Airbus and Boeing under an agreement between Tehran and world powers to ease sanctions in exchange for curbs on Iran's nuclear activities. Both deals hinge on a longer-than-expected process of winning U.S. Treasury approval, which is needed because of the high proportion of U.S. parts in virtually all modern jetliners, including those made by Europe's Airbus. There have also been delays in getting European banks to finance the deals because of restrictions over the use of U.S. dollars and concerns over legal risks if sanctions are re-imposed. Roads and Urban Development Minister Abbas Akhoundi told an aviation conference that Iran was complying with its obligations and continued to negotiate with other planemakers. "We are negotiating with all those big names. ... There are a lot of obstacles but I am sure that because we have respected all the international rules and regulations, all those problems are going to be resolved," he told the CAPA Aviation Finance Summit, the second large gathering of aviation leaders in Tehran since sanctions were lifted in January. Critics in the U.S. Congress argue that Iran could use passenger jets for military purposes such as transporting fighters to battle U.S. troops or allies in Syria or transfer the aircraft to airlines still under U.S. sanctions. ALSO READ: Iran executes Kurdish Islamists for armed attacks U.S. critics of the nuclear deal also say it could allow Iran to skirt remaining sanctions by transferring jets acquired by national carrier IranAir to airlines that remain on a U.S. blacklist, such as the country's largest carrier, Mahan Air. In an interview with Reuters, Akhoundi dismissed the concerns. "We are committed to any contract that we sign," he said. Tweet Do you ever witness anything interesting or exciting?

According to the U.S. Navy, Boeing and other sources, the P-8A is armed with missiles, mines, torpedoes, bombs, and a High Altitude Anti-Submarine Warfare Weapon system. The older P-8 type conducts anti-submarine warfare, anti-surface warfare, shipping interdiction and an electronic signals intelligence (ELINT) role. This involves carrying torpedoes, depth charges, Harpoon anti-ship missiles, and other weapons. It is also able to drop and monitor sonobuoys.

It's not a rhetorical question -- it might be a question of financial life or death. Rich Smith (TMFDitty) Sep 18, 2016 at 10:13AM SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket explosion, microseconds after it began on September 1, 2016. Image source: YouTube still. For SpaceX, it's back to square one -- or more precisely, square zero. A little over three weeks ago, a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket undergoing pre-launch testing at Cape Canaveral exploded on its launch pad. Along with the rocket, and an on-board Israeli satellite, the explosion sent SpaceX's year-long streak of successful launches up in smoke, resetting it to zero. Now the question is: How long will it take SpaceX to return to space? How long to get back to square one? A competitor chimes in Last week, a controversial headline from Reuters implied that United Launch Alliance (ULA) CEO Tory Bruno had predicted SpaceX would be out of commission for between nine and 12 months. Such an apparent assertion from a SpaceX rival (ULA is a joint venture between Boeing (NYSE:BA) and Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT), two of the biggest names in spaceflight and two of SpaceX's biggest competitors), naturally raised eyebrows. But reaching out to ULA, I was able to confirm that Bruno wasn't predicting such a long delay for SpaceX in particular -- or even necessarily. Rather, Bruno referred to the results of an internal ULA study surveying "the entire history of rocket failures dating back decades," which suggested nine to 12 months was the norm for any space company recovering from a mishap. So, what does history tell us about this? A tale of two space explosions No Boeing or Lockheed rockets have blown up in ULA's past 111 launch attempts. Rival Arianespace, the Airbus (NASDAQOTH:EADSY) subsidiary, boasts a streak nearly as long: 73 successful flights by its Ariane 5 launch vehicle, and a 74-flight streak by the Ariane 4 before it. But there are a couple of recent examples to guide us. Orbital ATK and Antares Take Orbital ATK (NYSE:OA), for example. On October 28, 2014, an Orbital ATK Antares launch vehicle carrying supplies to the International Space Station exploded over Wallops Island in Virginia, mere moments after liftoff. It took more than 13 months for Orbital to return to space (on December 6, 2015). Even then, it did so not on its own rocket -- but on a Lockheed Martin Atlas V. 13 months -- that's already past the high mark on ULA's timeline for rocket companies recovering from a setback. What's more, Orbital's efforts to return to space on its own rockets (to be powered by upgraded RD-181 engines from Russia) seem to be taking longer than expected. The revamped Antares has yet to make an operational flight, and its planned launch in August was postponed until later this month -- nearly two full years after the explosion at Wallops. SpaceX and the Falcon 9 SpaceX itself provides our second example. Prior to this month's explosion, SpaceX had successfully launched nine rockets in 12 months without incident. Moreover, its first launch of the streak featured a history-making re-landing of the launched rocket on Earth. But what preceded that streak? On June 28, 2015, a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket (like Orbital's, loaded with supplies for ISS) exploded two minutes into its flight -- the company's first failure after a previous streak of 20 successful launches. It took the company several weeks to confirm that a support strut within the rocket's second stage had failed, causing the explosion, and six months total to fix the problem and prepare Falcon 9 for its return to space. And there you have two examples -- one high of Bruno's nine-to-12 months estimate for the average time to return to space, and one below it. A question of financial life or death Facing the difficult task of determining what made its rocket explode when the "engines were not on and there was no apparent heat source" is a tough nut to crack. In fact, SpaceX CEO Elon Musk says this month's "anomaly" is "the most difficult and complex failure we have ever had in 14 years." But tough as the task seems today, SpaceX's previous success in getting its rocket ready to fly again in record time suggests the company may "beat the odds" again. In fact, SpaceX spokesman Dex Torricke-Barton tells me SpaceX expects "to have identified and resolved the cause of the anomaly" and "return to flight in November" -- a mere two-month turnaround time. Let's hope that's true -- because if it takes much longer, SpaceX could be in real trouble. SpaceX isn't like United Launch Alliance, you see. Unlike ULA, it cannot depend on backing from widely diversified aerospace giants Boeing and Lockheed Martin to keep it afloat when things go awry. Unlike Ariane, it has no Airbus to fall back on. SpaceX isn't even like Orbital ATK, a diversified military hardware supplier with a thriving business in building satellites. SpaceX launches rockets -- and that's it. Aside from that space launch, SpaceX has precious few revenue streams to fall back on. Every minute that SpaceX must spend figuring out why its rockets are blowing up, instead of launching them, is time the company is not collecting revenue, not earning profits, and not making progress toward Elon Musk's goal of amassing enough money to finance a manned mission to Mars. So long as SpaceX is kept busy figuring out the SpaceXplosion phenomenon, there can be no relaunch of a "used rocket," and no test launch of the company's new Falcon Heavy rocket, either. Meanwhile, SpaceX's website continues to describe the company as "profitable and cash-flow positive" -- even after two explosions and a combined seven months of inactivity over the past 15 months. The longer SpaceX remains grounded, though, the more questionable those claims will become. Fool contributor Rich Smith does not own shares of, nor is he short, any company named above.

Quotes in the article Boeing Co BA ▲ 145.98 +0.65 +0.45% Singapore Airlines Ltd SINGY ▼ 13.57 -0.44 -3.11% Delta Air Lines Inc DAL ▲ 48.73 +0.22 +0.45% As impressive and attention grabbing as the aircraft may be, it hasn't had the same paradigm-shifting effect that the Boeing 747 had upon its debut decades earlier.  Most of the airlines around the world who either operate the A380 or are thinking about investing in the plane have struggled to figure out a way to maximize its revenue generating potential. As a result, Airbus has struggled mightily over the past few years to find new customers for its flagship airliner.  However, the double-decker jet has no bigger supporter than Emirates Airlines. Of the 319 orders Airbus has won for the super jumbo, 140 of them have come from the Dubai-based airline. In comparison, Singapore Airlines has the second largest order with 24 A380s. < PREVIOUS SLIDESLIDE 1 of 4NEXT SLIDE > Airbus A380 © Provided by Business Insider Why does Emirates love the A380 so much? "Airport congestion around the world is getting worse," Emirates President Sir Tim Clark told Business Insider. "And up-gauging aircraft is a solution for this." Emirates' business strategy involves funneling large masses of people to its palatial home base in Dubai and dispatching them to various destinations around the world. Often times, those destinations are either well-developed first world cities or under developed third-world cities, that are both plagued by airports bursting at the seams with people and planes.  According to Sir Tim Clark, the A380 allows Emirates to get ahead of congestion issues at major airport around the world. With infrastructure struggling to keep up with demand for landing slots and airport gates, the superjumbo allows the airline to increase passenger volume with fewer aircraft and fewer flights. "It works great for our network structure's long-haul to long-haul connections," Emirates senior vice president for operations Hubert Frach told Business Insider in an interview. "It allows us to offer efficient connections between developing economies with well established economies." As a result, Emirates and its centrally located-Dubai base has become a gateway — connecting Europe and North America with Africa and Asia.  While other carriers operating the A380 have concerns over filling the double decker's cavernous cabin, Emirates does not seem to have that concern. "Although you can't operate each and every destination with the aircraft, we do see the demand pull of the A380," Frach said. "Take London for example. We operate nine A380 flights into London every day and, believe me, they are all full." And the strategy seems to be working. In May, Emirates announced a record $1.93 billion profit for the last fiscal year with a margin of 8.4%. Although it should be noted that Emirates, along with the rest of the airline industry, has benefited greatly from plummeting fuel costs. In addition, the rapid growth of Emirates and its fellow Middle Eastern carriers Etihad and Qatar have come under criticism from American, United, and Delta Air Lines. The US3 allege that the ME3's stellar performance and service are unfairly augmented by as much as $42 billion in subsidies over the past 10 years. The ME3 have denied these allegations. In addition to the operational benefits of the A380, it's also a great marketing piece. "At the Berlin Air Show, we usually bring a brand new A380 that's just been delivered from the Airbus factory in Hamburg and the line to see the plane usually a mile long," Sir Tim Clark told us while in New York for the US Open tennis tournament for which his airline is a major sponsor.  It's a sentiment echoed by Frach. "Every time I'm on an A380, I still see people taking selfies and photos of the plane," the executive added. "It's iconic and it's a customer magnet." Emirates isn't the only airline that understands the marketing power of the superjumbo. In May, Qatar Airways launched its inaugural flight to Atlanta — the home fortress for Delta, arguably the Middle Eastern airlines' staunchest critic. Although the flight is normally operated by a smaller Boeing 777, Qatar decided to make a splash by rolling into town with a superjumbo — an aircraft Delta does not possess in its 800-plane fleet. Etihad operates its glamour routes to London and New York using its A380s as well. Why don't more airlines buy the A380? If the A380 works so well for Emirates, why don't more airlines around the world commit to the plane? "Since the great recession, airlines around the world are run by risk averse boards who don't want to spend $400 million on a single plane,"  Clark said. "Here, we don't have that, it's just me and my boss (Emirates Group chairman H.H. Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum)." Due to geography, Emirates operates only international flights and boasts a fleet of roughly 250 wide-body long haul jets. In addition to the world's largest fleet of A380s, it also boasts the world's largest fleet of Boeing 777s with more than 150 of the twin-engined jets.   However, the reality of the A380 is that it is the largest and most expensive airliner in the world at $428 million a plane. Boeing's 777-9X is second at $400 million. Even though it's capable of offering its operators the lowest per-seat cost of any airliner in the world, its four-massive turbo fan engines are far from economical. As a result, even Emirates' well-financed neighbor Etihad have limited its fleet of A380s to just 10 planes.  "No, we're done," Etihad Aviation Group CEO James Hogan told Business Insider last year when asked whether he'd buy more A380s. "We just believe in two-engine technology — they are much more efficient."  But for now, the Airbus A380 is alive and moving forward with its most important customer.   "We are taking another 50 or so A380s," Clark said. "So we're keeping the production line going."

Rich Smith (TMFDitty) Sep 18, 2016 at 8:13AM Image source: United States Navy via Flickr. August was not a kind month to unmanned aerial vehicle maker AeroVironment (NASDAQ:AVAV). News that the company's revenues had declined 23% in fiscal Q1, while losses swelled 66%, sent AeroVironment's shares into a tailspin -- down 19% in a single day. But fear not, says AeroVironment. There's better news on the way -- and you can thank the U.S. Navy for it. Eyes in the sky On Sept. 7, AeroVironment announced the successful completion of a run of tests it conducted with the Naval Undersea Warfare Center. These tests showed how U.S. navy submarines can use AeroVironment Blackwing unmanned aircraft vehicles (UAVs) to communicate with "swarms" of drone submarines (called unmanned underwater vehicles, or UUVs). "Using an open-architecture communication system," says AV, Navy subs of the future will be able to communicate with and "control ... multiple unmanned vehicles over long distances." And there's more. At the same time they help sub-drivers to control "a swarm of unmanned undersea vehicles" wirelessly, these same Blackwings serve another purpose: As aerial eyes in the sky, they can beam down "unique intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) capability to submarine commanders." "Swarms"? Do we even have "swarms"? Now, if you've been following news in the world of underwater military robots, you know that the Navy does not actually possess literal "swarms" of UUVs for Blackwing to talk with. It has "a handful" at best. Boeing (NYSE:BA), Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT), General Dynamics (NYSE:GD), and Huntington Ingalls (NYSE:HII) all have prototype UUVs in development. And presumably, these are the "multiple UUVs" that Blackwing was communicating with during the Navy's Annual Naval Technology Exercise on Aug. 16, where Blackwing was tested.  In fact, if you squint, you can probably just make out depictions of Boeing's Echo Ranger, General Dynamics' Knifefish, and what might be either Huntington Ingalls' Proteus or Lockheed Martin's troubled "RMMV" drone submarines in AeroVironment's illustration of the Blackwing in action: Image source: AeroVironment. What it means for investors But that's not the point. Even if AeroVironment perhaps stretched the definition of "swarms" a bit, the major thesis of its argument rings true. Earlier this year, AV confirmed U.S. Navy plans in place to deploy its Blackwing across its fleet of attack and guided missile submarines. That fleet currently boasts 70 boats, with more on the way. As I've stated before, my best guess at the value of deploying Blackwing across this fleet is that it's worth roughly $5 million in revenue to AeroVironment, multiplied by the number of Blackwings deployed per submarine. I also assume that each sub would carry multiple Blackwings -- and now we're learning there may be more revenue streams in play as Blackwing gains new capability in commanding and controlling remotely operated drone subs. AeroVironment is notorious for holding the price of its wares close to the vest, so it's hard to say at this point precisely how big of a revenue opportunity this is. But for a small defense contractor like AV, it sure does sound like a sizable opportunity. One more thing: In its press release describing Blackwing, AeroVironment also disclosed that it has partnered with Sparton Corporation (NYSE:SPA) on the project. Smaller in size than General Dynamics or Huntington, and far smaller than Boeing and Lockheed, Sparton boasts a revenue stream 65% greater than AeroVironment's own -- but a market cap less than half AV's size. If you think AeroVironment is worth investing in on the prospect that Blackwing will take off, Sparton Corp may make for an even more promising opportunity.

Iran Air signs agreement to buy Boeing 737, 777 aircraft Khamenei has himself to blame for Iran's lack of foreign investment Saudi Arabia bans Iran’s Mahan Air over safety Iran to buy 114 Airbus planes this week, transport minister says Iran said the United States would now wait until the end of this month before deciding whether to approve export licences enabling Tehran to rebuild its civil aviation sector, according to a senior Iranian official on Sunday. Approval had been expected by the end of August, but that has been pushed back to the end of September, the deputy roads and urban development minister Asghar Fakhrieh Kashan said. "Today we are expecting that [approval] by the end of September for Boeing, Airbus and [European turboprop maker] ATR," he told the Capa Iran Aviation Finance Summit in Tehran. The US treasury can veto sales of modern aircraft to Iran, including non-US ones, due to the high proportion of US parts. An IranAir official said the airline is meanwhile looking to acquire second-hand aircraft or hire crewed aircraft to help to meet its most urgent needs. Iran had earlier urged the United States on Sunday to remove remaining obstacles to it buying passenger planes. Tehran provisionally agreed this year to buy more than 200 jets worth US$50 billion at list prices from Airbus and Boeing under an agreement between Iran and world powers to ease sanctions in exchange for curbs on Iran’s nuclear activities. There have also been delays in getting European banks to finance the deals because of restrictions over the use of US dollars and concerns over legal risks if sanctions are re-imposed. The roads and urban development minister Abbas Akhoundi said Iran was complying with its obligations and meanwhile continued to negotiate with other plane makers. "We are negotiating with all those big names … There are a lot of obstacles but I am sure that because we have respected all the international rules and regulations, all those problems are going to be resolved," he told the Capa summit, the second large gathering of aviation leaders in Tehran since sanctions were lifted in January. Critics in the US Congress argue that Iran could use passenger jets for military purposes such as transporting fighters to battle US troops or allies in Syria or transfer the aircraft to airlines still under US sanctions. US critics of the nuclear deal also say it could allow Iran to skirt remaining sanctions by transferring jets acquired by the national carrier IranAir to airlines that remain on a US blacklist, such as the country’s largest carrier, Mahan Air. The house of representatives in July passed two amendments that would stop the aircraft sales, although to become law they need to be approved by the senate and signed by the US president Barack Obama. Iran estimates it will need at least 400 aircraft to renew and expand its fleet, including some 250 in the next 10 years. The country is also planning nationwide airport expansion. "There are more than 60 airports in Iran but 80 per cent of flights are in just 10 and these are working beyond capacity; that is why we need to develop," Mr Akhoundi said. "They are all ready to attract investors, who are welcome to invest in any part," he told the conference held at Tehran’s Imam Khomeini airport, which plans a $2.8bn expansion. business@thenational.ae Follow The National’s Business section on Twitter Pages: Add your comment View all comments Related As the US withdraws, what changes must be made?

X Close World Home > News > World < Back to SMG 45 Sunday, 18 September 2016 | MYT 6:38 PM Iran expects U.S. export licences for aircraft at end-Sept - official TEHRAN (Reuters) - Iran has been told that the United States will issue export licences within weeks to facilitate the purchase of Boeing and Airbus jets and European ATR turboprop planes, a senior Iranian official said on Sunday. Approval had been expected by the end of August, but that has been pushed back to the end of September, Deputy Roads and Urban Development Minister Asghar Fakhrieh Kashan said. "Today we are expecting that (approval) by the end of September for Boeing, Airbus and ATR," he told the CAPA Iran Aviation Finance Summit in Tehran. The U.S. Treasury can veto sales of modern aircraft to Iran, including non-U.S. ones, due to the high proportion of U.S. parts. Failure to issue the required U.S. approval would breach an agreement between Tehran and world powers to ease sanctions in return for curbs on Iran's nuclear activities, Kashan said. An Iranair official said the airline is meanwhile looking to acquire second-hand aircraft or hire crewed aircraft to help meet its most urgent needs.

Iran provisionally agreed earlier this year to buy over 200 jets worth $50 billion at list prices from Airbus and Boeing under an agreement between Tehran and world powers to ease sanctions in exchange for curbs on Iran's nuclear activities. Both deals hinge on the longer-than-expected process of winning U.S. Treasury approval, which is needed due to the high proportion of U.S. parts in virtually all modern jetliners, including those made by Europe's Airbus. There have also been delays in getting European banks to finance the deals because of restrictions over the use of U.S. dollars and concerns over legal risks if sanctions are re-imposed. Roads and Urban Development Minister Abbas Akhoundi told an aviation conference that Iran was complying with its obligations and meanwhile continued to negotiate with other planemakers. "We are negotiating with all those big names ... There are a lot of obstacles but I am sure that because we have respected all the international rules and regulations, all those problems are going to be resolved," he told the CAPA Aviation Finance Summit, the second large gathering of aviation leaders in Tehran since sanctions were lifted in January. Critics in the U.S. Congress argue that Iran could use passenger jets for military purposes such as transporting fighters to battle U.S. troops or allies in Syria or transfer the aircraft to airlines still under U.S. sanctions. U.S. critics of the nuclear deal also say it could allow Iran to skirt remaining sanctions by transferring jets acquired by national carrier IranAir to airlines that remain on a U.S. blacklist, such as the country's largest carrier, Mahan Air. In an interview with Reuters, Akhoundi dismissed the concerns. "We have a contract. We will stick to it," he said. He also told a news conference that the Tehran event, attended by dozens of foreign firms, proved that aviation was international in scope and "the U.S. government cannot stand against it," according to a translation of his remarks. The House of Representatives in July passed two amendments that would stop the aircraft sales, although to become law they need to be approved by the Senate and signed by President Barack Obama.     Iran estimates it will need at least 400 aircraft to renew and expand its fleet, including some 250 in the next 10 years. Besides the aircraft sales, Iran is dangling the prospect of significant business for Western companies including nationwide airport expansion as it emerges from decades of sanctions. "There are more than 60 airports in Iran but 80 percent of flights are in just 10 and these are working beyond capacity; that is why we need to develop," Akhoundi said. "They are all ready to attract investors, who are welcome to invest in any part," he told the conference held at Tehran's Imam Khomeini airport, which plans a $2.8 billion expansion.

Comair CEO Erik Venter said this week that for everyone to stay in business, an airline had to go belly-up or airfares needed to increase. Aviation analyst Joachim Vermooten said there was over capacity due to SAA and Mango increasing their aircraft and the entry of FlySafair. Turning to Africa, Venter said that routes in Africa were “very thin” and most routes could only handle one airline. If another airline entered a route, both airlines would become lossmaking. “Opportunities in Africa are few and far between.” Comair has taken delivery of three new 737-800s from Boeing, with the last aircraft from the original order of eight aircraft scheduled for delivery in November. The delivery of eight Boeing 737-8 MAX aircraft will be made from 2019 to 2021. Venter said that the new aircraft saved Comair about R20 million in costs a year because they were more cost-efficient and reliable. “These are bigger aircraft and more seats can be sold,” he said. Comair was focused on its non-airline interests for growth and these included its airport lounges, pilot training centre and on-board food catering unit, Venter said. The airline would like to see half of its profits coming from its non-airline interests, up from 18% at the moment, he added. Venter said the new SAA board had “strong people”, but there was only so much they could do because the airline didn’t have the right people in its top executive. Venter said that Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan was likely to have persuaded a number of new board members to sit on the board. “If Pravin Gordhan goes, those people are also likely to go,” he said during an interview. At least six of SAA’s top 13 executives are in an “acting” or “interim” capacity, including CEO Musa Zwane. At the beginning of this month, Cabinet reappointed Dudu Myeni as SAA chair for a further year and appointed 11 new nonexecutive directors for three years, starting this month. SAA’s new board has three nonexecutives that have aviation industry experience. They are Myeni; deputy chairperson Tryphosa Ramano, who was SAA chief financial officer from 2004 to 2006; and Thandeka Mgoduso, who has served on the board of Air Traffic Navigation Services. Comair, which owns the local British Airways (BA) and kulula.com businesses, has a 17-person board and Venter said that five nonexecutive directors, excluding executives on the board, had aviation industry experience. These included Comair chairman Pieter van Hoven, who was Comair managing director from 1980 to 2006; Martin Moritz, Comair deputy chairman, who has been involved with Comair since 1969; Wrenelle Stander, a Comair nonexecutive and previously CEO of Air Traffic and Navigation Services; Khutso Mampeule, a Comair nonexecutive, who was CEO of SA Express from 1999 to 2001; and Gavin Halliday, a Comair nonexecutive, who served at BA for 18 years. Comair has brought a damages claim of as much as R2 billion, once interest has been factored in, against SAA for abusing its market dominance.

"There is no problem for selling airplanes to Iran and conditions are ripe for obtaining license from Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC)," Benturd told reporters in Ashgabat on Friday. He underlined that Boeing and the Iranian airliners are continuing their talks on the sale of passenger planes. OFAC is a financial intelligence and enforcement agency of the US Treasury Department. In mid-June, Head of Iran’s Civil Aviation Organization (CAO) and Deputy Road Minister Ali Abedzadeh announced that the country has signed a deal with Boeing on purchasing 100 planes from the US manufacturer. "The two sides reached a written agreement to purchase 100 planes," Abedzadeh said. He said that the written agreement was made after representatives of Iran and Boeing company held several rounds of talks, adding that the planes will be provided to Tehran through a financing deal. Earlier this month, Iranian Minister of Roads and Urban Development Abbas Akhoundi had also disclosed that the country has reached an agreement with global aviation giant Boeing. "We have reached a deal with the global aviation giant Boeing over the purchase of new planes that could set a new milestone in the country’s efforts to revamp its aging air fleet," Akhoundi said. The Iranian minister reiterated that the deal with Boeing has been finalized, and said, "Its details will be announced within next few days." Akhoundi reiterated that Iran has been able to save at least $5 million in its last negotiations over the finalization of the purchase.         Related News Japan's Mitsubishi Emerging as New Rival for Boeing, Airbus in Iran's Aviation Industry  Iran Declares Deal with Boeing  Minister: Iran, Boeing Agree on Airplane Purchase Deal  Official: Iran Negotiating with Boeing to Buy Aircraft from Giant Aviation Company  Boeing Official: Iran Can Purchase Airplanes in Euro  Boeing to Fix “Dollar Issue” for Iran Plane Deals  Boeing Offers 3 Plane Models to Iran  Boeing Due in Tehran Next Week to Talk Planes  LATEST STORIES (48) Syrian Soldiers Clash Fiercely with Nusra Terrorists in Dara'a City 15 Terrorists Killed, Wounded in Syrian Army Shelling in Southwestern Damascus Syrian Army Storms ISIL's Positions in Energy-Rich Region in Deir Ezzur 20 ISIL Terrorists Killed in Army Attacks in Deir Ezzur AEOI Spokesman: Iran to Export Extra Heavy Water to Foreign Countries Thailand Calls for Boosting Tourism Cooperation with Iran Commander: Iranian Navy to Provide Security for Further Development of Makran Coastline Iran, France to Hold Joint Economic Commission Meeting in Tehran Soon Terrorists Suffer Heavy Casualties in Syrian Army, Air Force Attacks in Aleppo Syrian Army Continues to Shell ISIL's Defense Lines in Eastern Homs Intelligence Minister: Enemies Unable to Distort Security in Iran Senior Cleric Blasts US for Sponsoring Terrorism in Region Iran Calls for Lifting Visa Barrier with Russia Entire Members of Terrorist Group Killed in Clashes with Syrian Army in Deir Ezzur Iran, Norway Ink MoU on Oilfield Development Syrian Soldiers Clash Fiercely with Nusra Terrorists in Dara'a City TEHRAN (FNA)- Syrian military forces engaged in heavy fighting with the militants of Fatah al-Sham Front (previously known as the al-Nusra Front) in Dara'a al-Balad district, killing several terrorists and destroying their positions. 15 Terrorists Killed, Wounded in Syrian Army Shelling in Southwestern Damascus TEHRAN (FNA)- Syrian Army's artillery units opened heavy fire at the concentration centers of Fatah al-Sham Front (previously known as the al-Nusra Front) in Western Ghouta, inflicting at least 15 casualties on the militants.

Under the agreement, JetBlue plans to purchase more than 33 million gallons of jet fuel with 30 percent renewable jet fuel content. The renewable jet fuel portion, which will be produced from select non-food plant oils, is targeted to achieve a 50 percent or higher reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions per gallon on a life-cycle basis. “With this announcement, U.S. airlines continue to lead the way to a more secure and environmentally friendly future,” said A4A’s Vice President, Environmental Affairs Nancy Young. “Sustainable alternative aviation fuels help our members build on their already strong environmental record and help reduce price volatility and enhance energy security by providing a competitor to petroleum-based jet fuel.” A4A and its members have long been leading advocates for the development and deployment of commercially viable, environmentally friendly alternative jet fuel. In 2006, A4A joined the Federal Aviation Administration, the Aerospace Industries Association and Airports Council International-North America in co-founding the Commercial Aviation Alternative Fuels Initiative® (CAAFI), which has helped take sustainable alternative jet fuels from test flights to commercial deployment. A4A also co-founded the Farm to Fly program with the U.S. Department of Agriculture and Boeing, a program linking sustainable feedstock supply with production and deployment, which now includes multiple government and industry partners. JetBlue joins other A4A members, including United, FedEx, Southwest and Alaska, with purchase agreements for alternative jet fuel, with United already receiving supply for aircraft operations at Los Angeles International Airport. U.S. airlines drive 5 percent of U.S. economic activity but account for only 2 percent of GHG emissions. U.S. airlines burned 6 percent less fuel in 2015 than they did in 2000, resulting in a 6 percent reduction in carbon dioxide emissions, even though they carried 24 percent more passengers and cargo over that period. Even so, the U.S. airlines are active participants in a global aviation coalition that has committed to 1.5 percent annual average fuel efficiency improvements through 2020 and carbon neutral growth from 2020, subject to critical aviation infrastructure, operational and technology advances achieved by government and industry. ABOUT A4A Annually, commercial aviation helps drive nearly $1.5 trillion in U.S. economic activity and more than 11 million U.S. jobs. Airlines for America (A4A) vigorously advocates on behalf of the American airline industry as a model of safety, customer service and environmental responsibility and as the indispensable network that drives our nation’s economy and global competitiveness. Our member carriers and their affiliates transport more than 90 percent of all U.S. airline passenger and cargo traffic. America needs a cohesive National Airline Policy that will support the integral role the nation’s airlines play in connecting people and goods globally, spur the nation’s economic growth and create more high-paying jobs. A4A works collaboratively with the airlines, labor groups, Congress and the Administration to improve air travel for everyone.

Continue Reading Below Wall Street’s major averages traded in tight range, capping the session virtually unchanged as global oil prices trimmed gains and traders mulled key central bank meetings set for mid-week. Meanwhile, shares of defense companies that play a role in the war against terror-group ISIS climbed, including Lockheed Martin (LMT), Boeing (BA), General Dynamics (GD), Northrup Grumman (NOC).  While the impact of terror-related incidents tends to have a dampening impact on investor psychology, investors have become somewhat immune to singular acts, said Peter Kenny, senior market strategist at Global Markets Advisory Group. “To a degree, investors and the markets have become inoculated [or] immune to lone actor acts of violence and terror. In the bigger picture, the acts of violent and terror that have punctuated the landscape globally have begun to have an additive effect on the collective mindset of investors,” he said.

The BoJ is reported to be considering making negative interest rates a key component of future easing, while the Fed will discuss a prudent time to raise short-term interest rates.   Continue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT Still, federal funds futures, a tool used to show Wall Street’s expectations for changes in monetary policy from the Fed, showed a 15% probability of a rate rise this month, with forecasts for a rate hike by the end of the year sitting at just above 50%.   Given a string of weak economic data, Nomura Chief U.S. Economist Lewis Alexander said he expects to punt yet again on rate hikes at the conclusion of its two-day meeting this week, though given recent comments from Fed officials, a rate increase can’t be completely ruled out. “The economy’s performance in the first half of the year was relatively weak. There is some evidence of a pickup in recent months, but the latest data suggest that activity slowed at the end of the summer. We think the FOMC will need to see a more sustained acceleration of economic activity before raising rates again,” Alexander said.    The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a handful of global currencies, slipped 0.3% in recent action. Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury bond, which moves inversely to its price, was down 0.014 percentage point to 1.68%.   Elsewhere in the market, global oil prices pared gains of more than 2% in early-afternoon action. Prices were elevated after Venezuela said both OPEC and non-OPEC producers were close to solidifying a deal to bring stability to the market. Oil prices have seen heightened volatility since the summer of 2014 as oversupply worries have plagued the marketplace and large foreign producers have refused to cut prices to help clear the glut. West Texas Intermediate crude traded around $43.30 a barrel on Monday, while Brent, the international benchmark, climbed to just above $46 a barrel.  What do you think?

Anytime. Anywhere. NEWS OPS By Youkyung Lee. Updated September 19, 2016 9:08AM SHARE ALSO SEE Samsung Galaxy Note Note7 Smartphone Battery South Korea Verizon Samsung's recall of 2.5 million Galaxy Note 7 phones after several dozen caught fire and exploded may stem from a subtle manufacturing error, but it highlights the challenge electronics makers face in packing ever more battery power into ever thinner phones, while rushing for faster release dates. Announcing the recall on Sept. 2, Samsung confirmed dozens of cases where Note 7 batteries caught fire or exploded, mostly while charging. It plans a software update that will cap battery recharging at 60 percent capacity to help minimize risks of overheating. But it is urging owners to keep the phones turned off until they can get them replaced, beginning Monday. U.S. safety regulators stepped in Thursday with an official recall, saying Samsung's voluntary efforts were inadequate. Though Samsung promised replacement devices, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission said U.S. customers would be eligible for refunds if they choose. Replacements are expected in stores by next Wednesday. The Note 7 debuted to rave reviews in August thanks to its speed, new software features and -- not least -- the estimated nine hours it would run between charges. But all that power comes at a price: Users began reporting the phones were catching fire or exploding, in one case incinerating the SUV it had been left in. Aviation authorities in the U.S., Australia and Europe have urged passengers not to use or charge Note 7s while flying and not to put them in checked baggage. On Monday, Canada issued an official recall. Koh Dong-jin, Samsung's mobile president, said in announcing the recall on Sept. 2 that an investigation turned up a "tiny error" in the manufacturing process for the faulty batteries in the Note 7s that was very difficult to identify. The end of the pouch-shaped battery cell had some flaws that increased the chance of stress or overheating, he explained. That kind of manufacturing error is unimaginable for top-notch battery makers with adequate quality controls, said Park Chul Wan, a former director of the next generation battery research center at the state-owned Korea Electronics Technology Institute. Samsung and other experts should search for factors outside the battery cells that could have led to overheating, he said. "If Koh's argument is right, that makes Samsung SDI a third-rate company," Park said. "But it does not appear to be a simple battery problem." Time also is a factor in marketing and making the phones. In 2015, Samsung moved up its unveiling of its new Galaxy Note model to August from September, seeking a leg up on Apple's September iPhone upgrades. Before the issue of battery explosions emerged, supplies were not keeping pace with demand for the Note 7. Samsung has not recalled Note 7s sold in China, but the company has refused to say which of its two battery suppliers made the faulty batteries or clarify whose batteries are used in which Note 7 smartphones. The company also refused comment on South Korean media reports that it has stopped using batteries from Samsung SDI, one of its two suppliers, in the Note 7. C.W. Chung, an analyst at Nomura Securities in Seoul, cited SDI officials in estimating that about 70 percent of the batteries for the Galaxy Note 7 smartphones came from SDI. The other 30 percent are thought to have been supplied by Amperex Technology Ltd., a Chinese-based manufacturer that reportedly also is a main supplier of batteries for the iPhone. Problems with lithium batteries have afflicted everything from laptops to Tesla cars to Boeing's 787 jetliner, though having so many lithium-ion battery fires in a short time is unheard of, Park said. The batteries are ubiquitous in consumer electronic devices, favored by manufacturers because they are lightweight and pack much more energy into a small space than other power cells. But storing so much energy in a tiny space, with combustible components separated by ultra-thin walls, makes them susceptible to overheating if exposed to high temperatures, damage or flaws in manufacturing. If the separators fail, a chemical reaction can quickly escalate out of control. That's what happened with the Note 7, Samsung's Koh explained. "The flaw in the manufacturing process resulted in the negative electrodes and the positive electrodes coming together," he told reporters in Seoul. It is unclear how Samsung failed to discover the battery problem before launching the Note 7. It confirmed delays in shipments for extra quality tests weeks later, in late August, after photos of charred phones began popping up on social media. South Korean experts suggested Samsung may have been so ambitious with the Note 7's design that it compromised safety. "There was no choice but to make the separator (between positive and negative anodes) thin because of the battery capacity," said Lee Sang-yong, a professor at Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology who worked more than a decade at LG Chem, a leading lithium battery maker. Thicker separators can improve safety but will not necessarily prevent all overheating issues, he said. Doh Chil-Hoon, head of the state-run Korea Electrotechnology Research Institute's battery research division, said that based on the limited information provided by Samsung, he believes the push to increase battery power was part of the problem. "Even with a small manufacturing mistake, if there had been enough elements to ensure safety, it would not explode," Doh said. "It is a roundabout way of admitting weak safety." The Note 7 phones have a powerful 3,500 milliampere hour battery, whereas the Galaxy S7 smartphone, which has a slightly smaller body than the Note 7, features a 3,000 mAh battery. So does the Note 5, launched in 2015. Apple does not provide information on the iPhone's battery capacity in milliampere hours. But two research firms that specialize in analyzing tech gadgets and their components said the battery in the iPhone 6S Plus is 2,750mAh. The size of the battery in the newly released iPhone 7 is not yet known. The 3,500 mAh battery in the Samsung Note 7 is "one of the highest, if not the highest, capacity battery we've seen in a phone," said Wayne Lam, an industry analyst at IHS Markit Technology. Lam said he thinks the Note 7 battery problem resulted from weak controls in manufacturing, not a poor or unsafe design. A spokeswoman at iFixit, which publishes repair guides for electronic gadgets, offered a similar view. "We don't think any internal design changes in the Note 7 are responsible for the exploding batteries -- more likely just a manufacturing defect," IFixit's Kay-Kay Clapp said in an email. Apple has tweaked hardware and software it developed itself to make iPhones use power more efficiently, while Samsung has increased the capacity of the batteries in its phones. That can be done without increasing size by adjusting components or changing the production process, Lam said. "You have two different trajectories, with Samsung packing in more energy density, versus Apple trying to trim it down by optimizing everything else," he said, adding that the two rivals are "constantly locked in this arms race of improving and one-upping." While Apple and Samsung are using built-in batteries for their premium phones, LG Electronics, Samsung's smaller South Korean rival, has opted for a replaceable, 3,200 mAh capacity battery for its new premium, jumbo screen smartphone, the V20. LG chose to make the phone thinner and allow customers to extend battery life by swapping out batteries. "The security of the battery isn't directly related to whether the battery is replaceable or not," Cho Joon-ho, head of LG's mobile business, told reporters. "But we make efforts to secure safety with quality controlling tests beforehand." © 2016 Associated Press syndicated under contract with NewsEdge. All rights reserved.

National World Business Tech Sport Entertainment Life & Style Travel Motoring Profile Settings Sign Out travel Search Destinations Themes News Travel Troubles Cruising Snow Kiwi Traveller Real estate company wants to help you beat jet lag with an app MADELINE STONE Last updated 13:27, September 19 2016 MGM Hotels Special light systems, air purification and aromatherapy are all part of the "Stay Well" hotels. For people who have to travel frequently for work, maintaining a healthy lifestyle can be exceedingly difficult. Now a company has partnered with several US hotels to create a line of "Stay Well" hotel rooms equipped with high-tech features that have health in mind. The features — like a slowly increasing light that simulates the dawn, air purification systems, aromatherapy, memory foam mattresses, nutritious meals, and ambient sound that gradually increases in volume — are meant to improve air and water quality, regulate sleep patterns, and keep travellers from being exposed to allergens and germs. iSTOCK The apps suggest "Vitamin D Walks" that you can take at prime times to increase your sun exposure. Read more: * Researchers explain why jet lag can be worse when you travel east * Boeing is making a major change to its planes that could end jet lag as we know it First launched with 41 rooms at Las Vegas' MGM Grand in 2012, the Stay Well program has recently expanded to include 171 rooms at that hotel as well as others throughout the US.  Each of those properties also offers its own app, which can give travellers local recommendations and go into more detail on the wellness features you can expect to find in your room. A jet lag tool can give you a personalised jet-lag-fighting itinerary based on what time your flight lands and how far you've travelled. It will give you tips as specific as the best time to drink coffee and when to expose yourself to light to effectively beat jet lag. Blackout shades and circadian lighting make it easier for travellers to control their exposure to direct light. The apps suggest "Vitamin D Walks" that you can take at prime times to increase your sun exposure — a helpful reminder if you've been napping or suffering from jet lag. The Stay Well apps also come loaded with video meditations led by Deepak Chopra (Chopra sits on Delos' advisory board, along with Leonardo DiCaprio and former US Congressman Dick Gephardt). Ad Feedback Delos announced that it had raised an additional $20 million at an $800 million valuation in July. Bill Gates' Cascade Investment and Tampa Bay Lightning owner Jeffrey Vinik led a previous investment round of $108 million in October 2015. Delos has raised a total of $171.24 million in venture capital since it was founded in 2013 by Paul Scialla.

The Iranian government also spread out the welcome mat to foreign investors as it seeks to boost its aviation sector. Iran provisionally agreed earlier this year to buy more than 200 jets worth US$50 billion at list prices from Airbus and Boeing under an agreement between Tehran and world powers to ease sanctions in exchange for curbs on Iran’s nuclear activities. Both deals hinge on the longer-than-expected process of winning US Treasury approval, needed due to the high proportion of American parts in virtually all modern jetliners, including those made by Europe’s Airbus. There have also been delays in getting European banks to finance the deals because of restrictions over the use of US dollars and concerns over legal risks if sanctions are reimposed. Roads and Urban Development Minister Abbas Akhoundi told an aviation conference that Iran was complying with its obligations. “There are a lot of obstacles but I am sure that because we have respected all the international rules and regulations, all those problems are going to be resolved,” he told the CAPA Aviation Finance Summit, the second large gathering of aviation leaders in Tehran since sanctions were lifted in January. Critics in the US Congress argue that Iran could use passenger jets for military purposes such as transporting fighters to battle American troops or allies in Syria or transfer the aircraft to airlines still under US sanctions. American critics of the nuclear deal also say it could allow Iran to skirt remaining sanctions by transferring jets acquired by national carrier IranAir to airlines that remain on a US blacklist, such as the country’s largest carrier, Mahan Air. In an interview with Reuters, Akhoundi dismissed the concerns. “We have a contract. We will stick to it,” he said. He also told a news conference that the Tehran event, attended by dozens of foreign firms, proved that aviation was international in scope and “the US government cannot stand against it.” The House of Representatives in July passed two amendments that would stop the aircraft sales, although to become law they need to be approved by the Senate and signed by President Barack Obama. Iran estimates it will need at least 400 aircraft to renew and expand its fleet, including some 250 in the next 10 years.

Deputy Managing Director of Boeing Martin Benturd had two days earlier said the company is prepared to sell planes to Iran, adding however that the sales should be permitted by the Office of Foreign Assets Control. Intense competition between two giant aircraft manufacturers has posed obstacles over Iran's purchase of Airbus crafts, an Iranian aviation official said in June. Secretary of Association of Iranian Airlines Companies Maqsoud Asadi Samani has said that the major deal Tehran signed with Airbus to purchase 118 planes from the European aviation giant is still pending authorization from the US. Meanwhile the Americans seek to resolve the issue of a possible deal on exporting Boeing aircrafts to Iran before issuing the authorization for Airbus purchase, he added. The official added that the Iranian aviation company is in talks with Airbus and Boeing to settle the issue. US approval for Iran's purchase of Airbus crafts is necessary because more than 10 percent of components in Airbus planes are of American origin. Meanwhile all those individuals aiming to do business with Iran need to apply for OFAC license from the US Treasury.

Iran is trying to upgrade its aging airline fleet and in June signed an agreement with Boeing to buy 80 planes and lease 29 more. But the deal has come under pressure from lawmakers in the U.S. who have discussed various measures to restrict the sale, including prohibiting the Treasury Department from licensing it. The transaction would be the Chicago-based plane maker’s first in Iran since sanctions on the country were lifted in January and follows a $27 billion agreement with Airbus Group SE for 118 planes. Airbus jets have more than 10 percent U.S. content so they also require export licenses. “The U.S. should’ve issued the licenses already and they haven’t done that,” Kashan said, adding that they will be granted by the Office of Foreign Assets Control, known as OFAC. Kashan said Iran has an agreement with a leasing company for $10 billion in financing for the Airbus deal and that it will be signed within days. He didn’t disclose the name of the leasing company or say where it was based. The value of Iran’s deal with Boeing has yet to be finalized and financing talks are ongoing, he said. “Our latest forecast is that by the end of the current Iranian year (March 2017), we will definitely see a number of those planes, both from Airbus and Boeing, arrive in Iran,” he said.

Iran is ready to welcome foreign investors. Published: 15:57 September 18, 2016 Reuters   SMALL MEDIUM LARGE Tehran: Iran urged the United States on Sunday to remove remaining obstacles to it buying passenger planes following the lifting of international sanctions and spread out the welcome mat to foreign investors as it seeks to boost its aviation sector. Iran provisionally agreed earlier this year to buy over 200 jets worth $50 billion (Dh183.5 billion) at list prices from Airbus and Boeing under an agreement between Tehran and world powers to ease sanctions in exchange for curbs on Iran’s nuclear activities. Both deals hinge on the longer-than-expected process of winning US. Treasury approval, which is needed due to the high proportion of US parts in virtually all modern jetliners, including those made by Europe’s Airbus. There have also been delays in getting European banks to finance the deals because of restrictions over the use of US dollars and concerns over legal risks if sanctions are reimposed. Obstacles Roads and Urban Development Minister Abbas Akhoundi told an aviation conference that Iran was complying with its obligations and meanwhile continued to negotiate with other plane makers. “We are negotiating with all those big names ... There are a lot of obstacles but I am sure that because we have respected all the international rules and regulations, all those problems are going to be resolved,” he told the CAPA Aviation Finance Summit, the second large gathering of aviation leaders in Tehran since sanctions were lifted in January. Critics in the US. Congress argue that Iran could use passenger jets for military purposes such as transporting fighters to battle US troops or allies in Syria or transfer the aircraft to airlines still under US sanctions. US critics of the nuclear deal also say it could allow Iran to skirt remaining sanctions by transferring jets acquired by national carrier IranAir to airlines that remain on a US blacklist, such as the country’s largest carrier, Mahan Air. In an interview with Reuters, Akhoundi dismissed the concerns. “We have a contract. We will stick to it,” he said. Amendments He also told a news conference that the Tehran event, attended by dozens of foreign firms, proved that aviation was international in scope and “the US government cannot stand against it,” according to a translation of his remarks. The House of Representatives in July passed two amendments that would stop the aircraft sales, although to become law they need to be approved by the Senate and signed by President Barack Obama. Iran estimates it will need at least 400 aircraft to renew and expand its fleet, including some 250 in the next 10 years. Besides the aircraft sales, Iran is dangling the prospect of significant business for Western companies including nationwide airport expansion as it emerges from decades of sanctions. “There are more than 60 airports in Iran but 80 per cent of flights are in just 10 and these are working beyond capacity; that is why we need to develop,” Akhoundi said. “They are all ready to attract investors, who are welcome to invest in any part,” he told the conference held at Tehran’s Imam Khomeini airport, which plans a $2.8 billion expansion.

Iran provisionally agreed earlier this year to buy over 200 jets worth $50 billion at list prices from Airbus and Boeing following the removal of anti-Tehran sanctions. Later, the US House of Representatives in July passed two amendments that would stop the aircraft sales, although to become law they need to be approved by the Senate and signed by President Barack Obama. The Iranian minister also said that CAPA proved that aviation was international in scope and "the US government cannot stand against it”. The two-day CAPA Iran Aviation Finance Summit opened at Novotel Imam Khomeini International Airport on September 18 with the participation of business leaders and representatives of 150 aviation companies such as Airbus, Bombardier and Embraer. While the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) - a lasting nuclear deal between Tehran and world powers- came into force in January, some Iranian officials have complained about the US failure to fully implement the accord. Back in March, Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Seyed Ali Khamenei said Americans have yet to fulfill what they were supposed to do as per the nuclear deal. Iran still has problems in its banking transactions or in restoring its frozen assets, because Western countries and those involved in such processes are afraid of Americans, the Leader said at the time, criticizing the US for its moves to prevent Iran from taking advantage of the sanctions removal.

Fri 18 Nov 2016 | 10:58 GMT You are here: Home > News > World > Article Home News News by Country Top News Sport World Oddly Enough Investing Video AlertNet Humanitarian News About Thomson Reuters Iran urges U.S. to unblock aircraft deals, seeks investors Sun Sep 18, 2016 9:53pm GMT   Print | Single Page [-] Text [+] By Tim Hepher TEHRAN (Reuters) - Iran urged the United States on Sunday to remove remaining obstacles to buying passenger planes following the lifting of international sanctions and it spread out the welcome mat to foreign investors as it seeks to boost its aviation sector. Iran provisionally agreed earlier this year to buy over 200 jets worth $50 billion at list prices from Airbus (AIR.PA: Quote) and Boeing (BA.N: Quote) under an agreement between Tehran and world powers to ease sanctions in exchange for curbs on Iran's nuclear activities. Both deals hinge on a longer-than-expected process of winning U.S. Treasury approval, which is needed because of the high proportion of U.S. parts in virtually all modern jetliners, including those made by Europe's Airbus. There have also been delays in getting European banks to finance the deals because of restrictions over the use of U.S. dollars and concerns over legal risks if sanctions are re-imposed. Roads and Urban Development Minister Abbas Akhoundi told an aviation conference that Iran was complying with its obligations and continued to negotiate with other planemakers. "We are negotiating with all those big names. ... There are a lot of obstacles but I am sure that because we have respected all the international rules and regulations, all those problems are going to be resolved," he told the CAPA Aviation Finance Summit, the second large gathering of aviation leaders in Tehran since sanctions were lifted in January. Critics in the U.S. Congress argue that Iran could use passenger jets for military purposes such as transporting fighters to battle U.S. troops or allies in Syria or transfer the aircraft to airlines still under U.S. sanctions. U.S. critics of the nuclear deal also say it could allow Iran to skirt remaining sanctions by transferring jets acquired by national carrier IranAir to airlines that remain on a U.S. blacklist, such as the country's largest carrier, Mahan Air.   Continued...

Approval had been expected by the end of August, but that has been pushed back to the end of September, Deputy Roads and Urban Development Minister Asghar Fakhrieh Kashan said. "Today we are expecting that (approval) by the end of September for Boeing, Airbus and ATR," he told the CAPA Iran Aviation Finance Summit in Tehran. The U.S. Treasury can veto sales of modern aircraft to Iran, including non-U.S. ones, due to the high proportion of U.S. parts. Failure to issue the required U.S. approval would breach an agreement between Tehran and world powers to ease sanctions in return for curbs on Iran's nuclear activities, Kashan said. An Iranair official said the airline is meanwhile looking to acquire second-hand aircraft or hire crewed aircraft to help meet its most urgent needs.

A recent history of exploding batteries; plus other infamous recalls By Laura Berman of The Street | < PREVIOUS SLIDE SLIDE 1 of 10 NEXT SLIDE > Companies have been plagued by safety concerns and large-scale recalls Samsung Electronics is in damage control mode. The world's largest smartphone retailer halted sales of its Galaxy Note 7 phone and recalled millions of units after 35 reports of the phones' batteries catching fire. The phone, universally well-received by reviewers, was released as Samsung rival Apple struggled to live up to its record of innovation. "As a gesture of appreciation, consumers will receive a $25 gift card or bill credit from select carrier retail outlets when choosing a Galaxy S7 family device or the Galaxy Note 7 within the exchange program," Samsung said in a Sept. 2 statement, noting that it was "taking great care" despite the "small number of reported incidents." At issue are the phones' lithium-ion batteries, which have forced product recalls in many products and companies over the years. While more efficient than conventional batteries, they're also more flammable, and have caused issues in everything from computing technology to automotive engines to cooling systems. Companies including Tesla and Boeing, Sony to Hewlett Packard to name a few have been affected. In Samsung's case, New York City's Metropolitan Transit Authority is cautioning riders to turn the phones off before entering a subway station or boarding a bus. Click ahead for a look at some of the best-known cases of catastrophic product recalls, some of which also feature the dreaded lithium-ion battery. © TheStreet AdChoices AdChoices Up Next 15 of the biggest business disasters of all time Lovemoney AdChoices More From The Street 20 Companies Pushing the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade The Street 10 Four-Wheel Drive Vehicles That Are All Set for the Snow The Street 10 Ways to Make Your LinkedIn Profile Stand Out The Street 25 Winter Warmer Beers Worth Enjoying This Season The Street The Street View the full site Home News Weather Entertainment Sports Money Lifestyle Health & Fitness Food & Drink Travel Autos Video election 2016 © 2016 Microsoft Privacy Legal About our Ads Feedback Help MSN Worldwide Newsletter

November 17, 2016 in News // Fuel Your App-etite November 17, 2016 in News // The Emoji Takeover State of the Union: Economic Solutions for Middle Class Posted on January 29, 2015 in News, Opinion, Uncategorized As President Barack Obama revealed his new economic plans during last Tuesday’s State of the Union address, the cries of socialism inevitably rose on my Facebook feed. After reading the speech, I was reminded of an old life lesson: no one rides for free. While the president discussed everything from foreign policy to education, the big focus of his address was on unrolling new economic plans for America. This new strategy focused on a few key points involving tax breaks for the middle class, tax hikes for the wealthy, new labor benefits, a higher minimum wage and two years free community college. For the past few years, people considered these ideas as “freebies” given out by the federal government. Truthfully, that is a very short-term view of this type of policy which ignores the fact that there are certain unspoken expectations to any favor being offered. Middle class economics, as Obama calls it, comes with a few unmentioned purse strings attached. Reduced taxes and new write-offs are done in order to develop a feeling of financial stability for the working class that was stolen during the 2008 recession. As many families lost their jobs and savings, tightened budgets meant less frivolous spending. In a capitalist-based economy when consumers don’t spend, then profits, companies and workers take massive blows. “To give working families a fair shot, we still need more employers to see beyond next quarter’s earnings and recognize that investing in their workforce is in their company’s long-term interest,” Obama said. An aspect not discussed on increasing education and labor protections is that it encourages more people to go to work. The yearly cost of two children in a daycare center is more than the cost of the median rent for a year in every state, according to a study done by Child Care Aware. By offering tax breaks, it encourages families to have two working parents, meaning more financial security and more income to tax. Offering free education and programs like Biden’s workforce training gives Americans who have been struggling for years new opportunities. “Tonight, I’m also asking more businesses to follow the lead of companies like CVS and UPS, and offer more educational benefits and paid apprenticeships — opportunities that give workers the chance to earn higher-paying jobs even if they don’t have a higher education,” Obama said. Basic mathematics tells us that it is impossible to work 40-hours a week on the current minimum wage and live above the national poverty line. After food and rent comes living expenses, leaving very little after to a splurge on a new pair of shoes. When a trip to Target seems out of reach, it also affects more than four million Americans who are employed by the retail industry, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Those little trips to the mall or a restaurant fuel private industry and states, like Florida, that impose a sales tax. Everything you spend is revenue, which is why the government wants you to feel able to buy more. “And to everyone in this Congress who still refuses to raise the minimum wage, I say this:  If you truly believe you could work full-time and support a family on less than $15,000 a year, try it,” Obama said. President Obama claims that 17 of the 50 states raised minimum wages in his first interview after the speech with Hank Green. Some of the benefits of increased minimum wages are not only more money in the bank accounts of Americans, but also less turnover and training costs for companies as more workers are incentivized to stay in their positions. This was a concept implemented by the famous businessman Henry Ford, who paid twice the minimum wage in 1914 in order to allow his laborers to purchase the Ford product. It is as simple as this: the government will help you put more back in your pocket so you can go out and buy more, therefore improving our economy. Increasing taxes on the wealthy is not a permanent solution, but a Band-Aid to cover the real problem of funding this new fiscal policy. With all the loopholes in the tax code, the entire thing should be re-evaluated and rewritten, a fact Republican Joni Ernst agreed with in her response to Obama’s address. With different agendas at heart, both parties agree Uncle Sam wants Americans to pay their taxes. “Republicans think tax filing should be easier for you, not just the well-connected. So let’s iron out loopholes to lower rates — and create jobs, not pay for more government spending,” said Ernst in her GOP rebuttal. Early in 2014 there was a large controversy regarding a study published revealing that 26 of America’s largest corporations paid no taxes, including big names like Verizon and Boeing. Now this was released by an independent activist group, Citizens for Tax Justice, but it isn’t the first time the issue has been brought about. Unfortunately, the lack of money being brought in to government revenue is completely legal due to legislation that has historically been pushed for by lobbyists and special interest groups that hold the purse strings. “As Americans, we don’t mind paying our fair share of taxes as long as everybody else does, too.  But for far too long, lobbyists have rigged the tax code with loopholes that let some corporations pay nothing while others pay full freight,” Obama said. Democrats are hoping to use these tax changes to fund this new economic plan, but I highly doubt that will manage to pass a Republican-dominated Senate without serious compromises along the way. In theory, middle-class economics will pay for itself over time. The wealthy tax increase will have a very short lifespan even if it does manage to succeed through the Senate floor. If this economic plan goes forward, it will go forward in a modified capacity with compromises on corporate tax incentives to help develop labor protections and create American jobs. Once consumer spending increases and expands the private market, tax cuts for the wealthy will once again pass through Congress. NASA HQ PHOTO/flickr.com President Barack Obama waves upon entering Congress before beginning the State of the Union address on Tuesday, January 20. So what happens in the long term? “If America cannot get its act together on the jobs front, its many other serious wounds will not heal,” wrote Bob Herbert, author of Losing Our Way. Unemployment and poor job opportunities aren’t the only problems facing us today but as Herbert points out in his book, the only way to fix this nation is through a strong middle class. A representative government has long since fallen to special interest groups and lobbyists to create policies that do nothing for the people. Right now, we may have to spend the money to get back to solid ground. Frankly, unless anyone else can come up with a bipartisan plan to help decrease the wage gap and stabilize the working class, Obama’s plan may be the only option to move the American economy back from barely surviving to thriving.   Doha Madani can be reached at doha.madani@theminaretonline.com   Share this: Twitter Facebook Google Like this: Like Loading...

While few expect Federal Open Market Committee to announce a rate hike this week, most bet they will do so later this calendar year. “Fears about the Fed increase and then dissipate, and all you can do is try to follow that news flow,” lan Higgins, chief investment officer at Coutts & Co in London, told Bloomberg. “The Fed is very aware of what the market is looking for and hopefully we’ll get no policy shock.” In 3.10pm trading in New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.2 percent, while the Nasdaq Composite Index inched 0.01 percent higher. In 2.55pm trading, the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index gained 0.3 percent. "The market has been all over the place. It’s been driven by the threat of higher interest rates," Jake Dollarhide, chief executive officer of Longbow Asset Management in Tulsa, told Reuters. "Most people feel the most unloved bull market in recent memory will be cut off at the knees by higher interest rates and the Fed is certainly threatening that in the near term.” The Dow moved higher as advances in shares of 3M and those of Boeing, recently trading 1.2 percent and 1.1 higher respectively, outweighed slides in shares of Merck and those of Intel, down 1.3 percent and 1 percent respectively. Some are keen for the Fed to move now. "Let's get on with it already," Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors, told Reuters. "It will cause some challenges to the market but I think that is healthy in context of a normal business cycle. It will increase the cost of capital, and flush out some riskier assets in the short term. But that is probably the right thing to do." Meanwhile, a report showed that a gauge of US home builder sentiment in September climbed to the highest level in almost a year, according to the National Association of Home Builders and Wells Fargo. “As household incomes rise, builders in many markets across the nation are reporting they are seeing more serious buyers, a positive sign that the housing market continues to move forward,” NAHB Chairman Ed Brady, a home builder and developer from Bloomington, Illinois, said in a statement. “The single-family market continues to make gradual gains and we expect this upward momentum will build throughout the remainder of the year and into 2017.” In Europe, the Stoxx 600 Index ended the day with a gain of 1 percent from the previous close. Germany’s DAX index rose 1 percent, France’s CAC 40 index climbed 1.4 percent, while the UK’s FTSE 100 Index increased 1.5 percent.

Recent news shows that more Chinese are travelling and demanding more services. The stories show that, reflecting this, the Chinese travel industry is taking increasing global market share, developing digital strategies and services, and online companies are pulling in the money.  Even the economy, a key driver for outbound tourism, is producing positive numbers. Just out is that very accurate barometer of activity, power consumption: it rose by over 8% in August. While the outbound travellers figures are not rocketing in the way they have in the past (from a smaller base) they are still strong. According to the ChinaTravelNews website, travel agencies organised 13.7 million outbound trips in Q2 2016, up 17.3% quarter-by-quarter. Last year’s numbers were up ‘only’ 9.8% compared to 20% growth in earlier years, but they are forecast to rise by 11.5% this, it says. Fuelled by experience-hungry millennials and a growing middle class, the number of Chinese passport holders is forecast to swell by over 100 million over the decade ‘Dramatic increases’ in Chinese visitors to destinations across Asia, Europe and beyond, have been forecast in an oft-quoted Goldman Sachs industry report. Analysts at the international banking group point out, in their report ‘The Chinese Tourist Boom’, that as yet only 4% of Chinese have passports. The report says: ‘Fuelled by experience-hungry millenials and a growing middle class the number of Chinese passport holders is forecast to swell by over 100 million over the decade - equal to 1.5X all outbound US tourists today.’ Thus, by 2020 outbound numbers will, it states, rise from this year’s 120m by 220m by 2025. Moneybags The moneybags certainly seem happy with China travel. BlaTravel, an aggregator platform for tours and boutique hotels, said a few days ago that it has received millions of yuan from a group of investors. SaaS platform Zowoyoo got away another round of funding, raising an undisclosed amount from Guangdong Cable Network. The parent company of Joyu, which aims to be the China’s one-stop travel industry O2O group, is going for RMB1bn to help establish it. PMS provider Green Cloud pulled RMB 15 million and is looking for a further RMB 30m. China’s largest OTA Ctrip said that two of its existing shareholders, Baidu and Priceline, have put in more money to boost its $2.7bn cash pile. The moneybags certainly seem happy with China travel. The buoyant mood is shared by China’s airline industry, which is rushing to fill demand. Three Chinese airlines have filed applications (Sept 8) with the Civil Aviation Administration of China to launch new international services, according to China Aviation Daily. As China builds up to become a major transit hub, Air China, China’s flag carrier, announced on September 1 that it would be the first airline to launch a thrice-weekly flight from Shanghai to California. Beijing and Shanghai are presenting themselves as new alternatives to traditional stops like Tokyo, Seoul and Hong Kong. (And hope that more travellers will stop a few days.) At this rate, major aircraft manufacturer Boeing estimates, China’s will need 6,810 new aircraft in the next 20 years (costing $1 trillion-plus) - over 70% for growth rather than replacement. Those planes will make China the first $1 trillion aircraft market, and many of them will be for international travel. The strength of China Air has attracted Lufthansa, which has just finalised a JV for share revenue and co-ordinate routes with its Star Alliance partner. (Air France-KLM already has JVs with Skyteam alliance partner Southern Airlines, China’s largest airline by passengers.) The right ‘personal’ moves Everything seems to be pushing in the right direction - the government target is to increase wages across the board; the Chinese want to spend this extra income ‘having fun’, says Goldman’s, getting abroad to tour and shop. This is especially the case among ‘the young millennial travellers who make up two-thirds of outbound travellers’, adds the report.  Visa barriers are tumbling in the face of the anticipated wall of Chinese cash. Another change is that today’s Chinese travellers are becoming more sophisticated and increasingly travelling independently rather than in organised groups. This is what China’s largest online travel player, Ctrip, chairman James Liang told investors on a conference call in early September. Today the Chinese want to ‘personalise their travel experience’. Today the Chinese want to ‘personalise their travel experience’. Ctrip is responding by ‘..focusing on enhancing our one-stop travel platform, increasing our international inventory coverage...’ As the company centres in on travellers outside of China it is offering international products covering air tickets, hotels, rental cars, local attractions and shopping. In its package tour business (up 44% year-on-year) its tour-guide booking service enables customers to chose their own tour guide. To raise the game and its brand image overall it has become the first travel service management company to become certified for the British Standards Institute’s ISO 27001 standard. What if China’s growth is not as steady as this month’s numbers indicate? Goldman’s ‘do not expect economic slowdown in China to have major impact on tourist numbers’. Rather, it expects tourist numbers to increase given: the Chinese passport ratio; middle class income is rising; households are spending more and millenials are not adverse to foreign travel. To back up its view it points out that the Japanese did not stop holidaying abroad when Japanese economic bubble burst. Not only does there seem to be little of a link between the economy and foreign holidays in South Korea or even the UK, it notes, but not even a weak currency fails, it seems, to put off travellers.

WOOD brooke@southwesttimes.com “In the Army, we learned to go where they sent you, do your job and that was it,” Ronald Vaughan says. Vaughan, a 93-year-old Pulaski native, was among those who served stateside during World War II. Slightly more than a quarter of the men and women who served during that war served right here, protecting U.S. shores, and building, testing and inspecting the equipment being used by American soldiers fighting in the European, Pacific and African theaters. Vaughan inspected B-17s, B-24s and B-29s to make sure they were safe and ready before an American pilot ever stepped into the cockpit. Before he was inspecting planes, Vaughan was growing up in Pulaski. He was born on Pulaski Street and still lived there at the beginning of the Great Depression with his parents, Oscar and Nina McCroskey Vaughan. “My father had a good job at a local foundry, and then one day, he didn’t have anything. He was out of work.” After the plant closed, the Vaughans moved with Ronald and his sister into his maternal grandparents’ house on nearby Cliff Street. Today, he and his wife, Louise, live in a house beside that same house that they now own. As a teen, he developed a severe eye infection: “I was sitting in the movie theater one night, and I reached up to wipe my eye and everything went blank.” Vaughan ended up being treated by a Roanoke doctor for “inflammation of the right eyeball.” He graduated from Pulaski High School in 1941. He was eventually drafted, but the vision problems caused by his infection led to him being turned down twice. “I couldn’t see. But they did end up drafting me and sent me to Shepard Field, Texas for basic training,” he says. After that, he was sent for training to Kessler Field, Miss. He then went to Ypsilanti, Mich. for advanced training in B-24s. But his first assignment was working on B-17s. On his first furlough, he returned to Pulaski to marry Louise, a Radford native he had met through friends who set them up. They were married in his parents’ house. The Vaughans don’t remember where they went for their first date, but they think it may have been the Roundhouse in Fairlawn near the intersection of Route 11 and Pepper’s Ferry Road. A few years ago, the couple started eating out for every meal – and they celebrated their 72nd wedding anniversary last month by eating out. After marrying Louise, he headed to Alexandria, La., where he stayed until he was shipped to Andrews Field in Washington, D.C. He stayed there for the last six months of the war. Vaughan said he never thought about not being sent overseas since he did what they told him to do. Vaughan was trained on Boeing’s new B29, and was later selected for special mechanical training on the aircraft. The B29, sometimes called the “Superfortress,” was a four-engine propeller-driven heavy bomber. The high-tech plane was one of the largest aircraft used during World War II, and historians refer to it as the single most expensive aircraft project undertaken by the United States in World War II. This plane included a pressurized cabin, all-dual wheeled, tricycle landing gear, and a remote, computer-controlled fire-control system that directed four machine gun turrets that could be operated by a single gunner and a fire-control officer. They were later used in the atomic bomb attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. “I was on the flight line. We checked them out after every flight,” Vaughan explains. After the war, Vaughan worked at Jefferson Mills for 21 years. Vaughan adds, “Then I went to work at the Radford Army Ammunition Plant (RAAP) for another 21.” He retired a few months short of 65. Their two children both became doctors. Ronald O. Vaughan is a retired dentist, and Dennis Vaughan is a Radford orthodontist. According to Louise, “They were always good boys.” Today, they have six grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren spread from Richmond to Panana City, Fla. In his younger days, Vaughan was a serious bowler, spending at least four nights a week strategically knocking down pins. “I was pretty good at it,” he says. He won competitions while bowling with several different teams, including one group from Jefferson Mills. Until this year, the couple spent several weeks at Myrtle Beach every year. Five years ago, the couple was standing in the living room of their Cliff Street home when the Pulaski tornado came through. “We were watching it happen, but didn’t realize what we were watching. We had no idea it was a tornado,” Vaughan explains. In fact, Vaughan remembers just thinking it was a very bad wind. “I told Louise, ‘There’s my shingles going.’ I knew it must be a bad wind, and it was.” The grandparents’ home next door received considerable damage. Some of their trees snapped, and a big pine tree broke the fence. “We felt lucky, overall,” Vaughan says. Written by: Editor on September 19, 2016.

(Air Force graphic) The Air Force’s secretive and stealthy new bomber has a name, the B-21 Raider, the Air Force announced Monday. The name was unveiled by retired Lt. Col. Richard Cole, a 101-year-old veteran who served as a member of the “Doolittle Raiders,” which embarked on an audacious plan to bomb Japan months after the attack on Pearl Harbor in World War II. Cole served as the co-pilot of Jimmy Doolittle, whom he has called “the greatest pilot in the world.” The naming of the aircraft, to be built by Northrop Grumman, marks a significant milestone in a program that has been controversial almost from the start. After Northrop won the contract, the losing team of Boeing and Lockheed Martin protested the award. Critics have taken aim at the secrecy surrounding its cost. Analysts have also said that it is going to have to fight for funding every year, as it competes with other high-profile Air Force projects, such as the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter and the KC-46 tanker. [How much does the Pentagon’s secretive comber really cost?] “The bomber program has been progressing well, but critics have already painted a target on its back so large you could sail an Ohio-class sub or fly a Joint Strike Fighter through it,” Mackenzie Eaglen, a defense analyst at the American Enterprise Institute, wrote in an op-ed at Real Clear Defense. Falls Church-based Northrop is working on building 100 of the B-21 bomber, which is designed to penetrate deep into enemy territory and is capable of carrying nuclear weapons. The fleet is slated to enter service in the 2020s and would eventually replace the aging B-52s and the B-1s. world national-security checkpoint Get 2016 Olympics updates by email Our best news and analysis from Rio, delivered to your inbox. post_newsletter333 magnet-olympics2016 false endOfArticle false Please provide a valid email address.

Weather Your 4-day local weather forecast Saturday November 19, 2016 Opinion Larger / SmallerNight Mode NSW government vows to help protect and promote Defence jobs in the Hunter Anthony Roberts 19 Sep 2016, 10:30 p.m. The defence industry, as a vital part of the Hunter's economy, needs protecting. LANDING WORK: With support, the Hunter's growing defence industry sector can work to win future contracts to help bring more jobs, and investment, to the region. THE defence and security of a nation is the first order of duty for any national government and in Australia, NSW plays a most important role in that mission. We have more Defence bases and a larger defence industry than any other state. In fact, the defence industry is one of the most important industries for NSW, and a top priority for the NSW government. The industry is especially important here in the Hunter, the region with largest defence presence in NSW. The strength of the defence industry supply chain in the Hunter gives this region the competitive edge to feed into Australia’s major air, sea and land projects and the Australian government shares my confidence in this region. Only last month it awarded $300 million in procurement contracts for Williamtown and the Hunter. This month, Adelaide played host to Land Forces 2016, the nation’s premier land defence exhibition that attracts the leaders in defence technology from around the globe. One of the most impressive exhibitors was from the Hunter. Bohemia Interactive Solutions was showcasing its new simulator that replicates the experience of a soldier driving an Australian Defence Force vehicle over difficult terrain. The simulator trains our personnel to stay safe in hostile environments. NSW government support for Bohemia dates back to 2014 when we helped it become a foundation tenant at the Williamtown Aerospace Centre. Defence contributes $5.5 billion to the NSW economy each year and employs 30,000 people. For the Hunter, Defence plays a crucial role in the region’s economy. We want to see that continue, and with the Australian government’s Defence White Paper outlining programs and acquisitions worth more than $195 billion over the next 10 years, it’s vital that the Hunter positions itself to take advantage of the opportunities. My time at Land Forces was spent promoting our capabilities to the Australian government’s head of Defence acquisitions Kim Gillis, as well as meeting with ‘prime contractors’ like BAE Systems, Northrop and Boeing, who award sub-contracts worth many millions of dollars.  On Monday I attended the HunterNet Defence Conference, the largest of its type in Australia, to meet with local small and medium-sized business operators that fulfill sub-contracts for the major players. Because of the broad range of skills available across the Hunter they are in a prime position to tender for and win valuable Defence work. The Hunter is the centre of gravity for RAAF fast jet operations and maintenance activities by industry to support the fleet. With the introduction of the Joint Strike Fighter F-35 aircraft and their presence at Williamtown from 2018, further opportunities will arise for Hunter businesses. The NSW government is seeking to maximise those opportunities. As part of our efforts to boost the Hunter’s Defence sector, we’re also supporting the establishment of an Innovation Defence Hub at the Williamtown Aerospace Centre. The University of Newcastle was awarded $1 million to lead development of the hub. In June, I announced the appointment of retired air marshal John Harvey AM to the new position of defence advocate. He is working to grow Defence activities in NSW. Whether it’s vehicle simulators or jet maintenance, the NSW government is working to ensure the defence industry continues to bring jobs, innovation and diversity to the Hunter’s economy.

The study released on Monday by researchers at the non-partisan Peterson Institute for International Economics illustrates how, even as the New York businessman pledges to boost growth and create millions of jobs, most mainstream economists view his economic policies as dangerous quackery. The study also offers a sceptical view of Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton’s trade policies, and particularly her opposition to the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a vast new Pacific Rim trade pact the US has negotiated with Japan and 10 other economies.  But Mr Trump’s threats to rip up existing US trade agreements and impose punitive 45 per cent tariffs on goods from China and a similar 35 per cent levy on products imported from Mexico would probably set off a trade war and wreak huge damage on the US economy, the study found.  “While [Mrs] Clinton’s stated trade policy would be harmful, [Mr] Trump’s stated trade policy would be horribly destructive,” said Adam Posen, the institute’s president. “His stated approach to the global economy of waging trade war and protecting uncompetitive special interests would be disastrous for American economic wellbeing and national security.”  Mr Trump in a speech last week pledged to boost US growth to almost 4 per cent and create 25m jobs if he was elected. But the Peterson study shows that if he delivered on his trade policy promises and America’s trading partners responded in kind, as would be likely, the US economy would end up in recession within two years as consumption, investment and government spending all contracted.  Such a trade war would also hit the blue-collar workers to whom Mr Trump has pitched his trade policies hardest.  The biggest trade-related employment impact, the researchers found, would be in manufacturing and on states such as Washington, home to aircraft maker Boeing, and places such as Los Angeles, where the city’s port is the arrival point for much of the trade with China. Were China to retaliate and stop purchasing US aircraft, for example, it would result in the loss of 179,000 jobs, they calculated.  But the biggest impact on jobs would come as the consequences of a trade war reverberate out across the economy hitting retail distribution hubs, grocery stores, restaurants and even hospitals, the study found.  It also would likely lead to shortages and higher prices of consumer goods — including popular products such as smartphones — and potentially even have an impact on US retirement savings.  Because China extracts relatively little of the value of Apple’s popular smartphone, which is assembled in the country, for example, “the iPhone could be China’s secret weapon in retaliation,” the researchers wrote. “China’s self-inflicted losses would be minimal, but cutting off supplies to Apple could severely disrupt the availability and increase the price of a beloved consumer product.”  “In light of the ubiquity of Apple stock in [US retirement] plans, this action could adversely affect Americans’ retirement plans as well,” they wrote.  The researchers cited studies that have shown it would be impossible to build an iPhone from scratch in the US and that even if Apple were able to do so the additional cost would be about $100 per phone.  “Moreover, with Chinese firms moving into the smartphone market, China could disrupt not only the production of iPhones but also supply the alternative models,” they wrote. “The collective howl of pain might induce even the most ardent protectionist to reconsider.”  In a statement, the Trump campaign called the Peterson study a “globalist hit job”. “The Peterson Institute dresses up propaganda in a wardrobe of “scholarship” that shamelessly promotes globalism and criticises anyone who dares oppose it,” Trump advisers Wilbur Ross and Peter Navarro said. Rather than provoke a trade war, Mr Trump and his threats would lead to negotiations that would “end the undeclared trade war now being waged on American workers by cheaters like China”, they said. “This fear-mongering fails to understand the negotiating power of the US in the world economy.” US sectors that would be worst affected by a full trade war Sector Percentage of jobs lost High-speed drives and gear manufacturing 10.2 Construction equipment manufacturing 10.0 Iron and other metal ore mining 10.0 Semiconductor equipment manufacturing 9.7 Other metalwork manufacturing 9.6 Sample the FT’s top stories for a week You select the topic, we deliver the news.

"We are negotiating and I hope that during the trip of President (Hassan) Rouhani to the US today or tomorrow, we can have some news on the subject (removal of banking obstacles)," Fakhrieh Kashan told foreign investors at the CAPA Iran Aviation Finance Summit in Tehran on Sunday, Reuters reported. President Rouhani will travel to New York to participate in the 71st Regular Session of the UN General Assembly which opened at the UN headquarters on Tuesday, September 13, 2016. IranAir Chairman Farhad Parvaresh is also travelling to New York as part of Rouhani's delegation for the UN General Assembly. Earlier on Sunday, Iran’s Roads and Urban Development Minister Abbas Akhoundi said that Tehran was complying with its obligations under the JCPOA, giving assurances that remaining obstacles put by the US in the way of global aviation giants to sell passenger aircraft to the country will be removed soon. “We are negotiating with all those big names …there are a lot of obstacles but I am sure that because we have respected all the international rules and regulations, all those problems are going to be resolved," Akhoundi told the Summit. The two-day CAPA Iran Aviation Finance Summit opened at Novotel Imam Khomeini International Airport on September 18 with the participation of business leaders and representatives of 150 aviation companies such as Airbus, Bombardier and Embraer. Iran provisionally agreed earlier this year to buy over 200 jets worth $50 billion at list prices from Airbus and Boeing following the removal of anti-Tehran sanctions. Later, the US House of Representatives in July passed two amendments that would stop the aircraft sales, although to become law they need to be approved by the Senate and signed by President Barack Obama. While the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) - a lasting nuclear deal between Tehran and world powers- came into force in January, some Iranian officials have complained about the US failure to fully implement the accord. Back in March, Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Seyed Ali Khamenei said Americans have yet to fulfill what they were supposed to do as per the nuclear deal. Iran still has problems in its banking transactions or in restoring its frozen assets, because Western countries and those involved in such processes are afraid of Americans, the Leader said at the time, criticizing the US for its moves to prevent Iran from taking advantage of the sanctions removal.

By Kedar Grandhi September 19, 2016 06:18 BST The job cut move comes at a time when Rolls-Royce is planning to double the production of its jet engines for the Boeing 787 Dreamliner and the Airbus A350Reuters Rolls-Royce Holdings has announced that it is expanding its job cuts. The British company which makes power systems for the aviation and other industries said it will cut more than 200 jobs at the middle management level. The move is part of a larger restructuring programme announced by CEO Warren East in November 2015. It aims at rebuilding investor confidence in the engineering company after a series of earnings disappointments. It is expected to save between £150m ($195.53) and £200m annually beginning 2017. The current job cuts follow 400 management positions Rolls-Royce said it would eliminate in May. This takes the total trimming of management positions under East's leadership to more than 600. Overall, including job cut announcements across all levels, the latest move takes the total redundancy count to about 4,000 in less than two years. While the current job redundancies will be across the group, most of them are said to be at the company's aircraft engine business division, which has clients such as Boeing and the Airbus Group. This division has already seen about 2,600 other job cuts being announced. The Financial Times cited an unnamed company insider as saying that the move brings to an end the first stage of the restructuring programme that was aimed at streamlining the senior and middle management levels. The source added that additional job cuts could not be ruled out as the company continues to seek efficiencies wherever possible. Further redundancies could be done on a voluntary basis wherever possible, the source added. The move comes ahead of a meeting scheduled in November, where East is expected to update investors on further savings in the next stage of his restructuring plan in order to increase the group's competitiveness. It also comes at a time when the company is planning to double the annual production of its jet engines to meet demand for Boeing 787 Dreamliner planes and the Airbus A350.

The country’s national airline has provisionally agreed to buy U.S. and European aircraft worth over $ 50 billion at list prices, marking a high-profile test case for the reopening of its economy under a deal with world powers to ease sanctions. Nine months after the sanctions deal took effect, foreign banks are reluctant to get involved because of concerns that they could be caught up in restrictions applying to U.S. banks, which are still banned from doing business with Iran. Under the deal to lift nuclear-related sanctions, Iran can buy passenger planes and other goods but is not allowed to pay for them in dollars or to use the U.S. financial system, due to core U.S. sanctions that remain in force. The ban on paying in dollars is a particular headache for Boeing and international leasing companies, which usually account for their portfolios in the world’s leading currency. Paying in other hard currencies could generate fleeting movements in the U.S. financial system known as U-Turn transactions, which are also banned.

One pilot says he's been "blown away" by the controversial plane's capabilities.(Aug 12, 2016) 1. Soundbite: Lt.-Col. George Watkins, US Air Force pilot 2. Soundbite: Lt.-Col. Curtis PittsUS Air Force pilot Placeline: Abbotsford, British Columbia Credit: The Canadian Press Storyline: The new-age fighter jet once poised to replace Canada's aging CF-18 fleet, but whose ballooning price tag and controversial selection process threw its purchase into doubt, has made its inaugural visit to Canada. A pair of F-35 stealth fighters roared into British Columbia on Thursday in preparation for the annual Abbotsford International Airshow. The next-generation aircraft, whose development has been marred with delays and cost overruns, has been the source of ongoing angst in Ottawa as Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's government grapples with finding a replacement for the country's long-outdated fighter jets. Trudeau told the House of Commons in June that the F-35 "does not work and is far from working," two months before a surprise announcement last week that the aircraft is ready for combat. Lt.-Col. George Watkins, a pilot with the U.S. air force's 34th Fighter Squadron, flew one of two operational planes to B.C. from Hill Air Force Base in Utah. Speaking on the tarmac in front of one of the aircraft, he described flying the F-35 as "awesome." "I'm very confident in the combat declaration that we made, combat ready," Watkins said. "Being a combat commander in a fighter squadron, I personally wouldn't go to war with any other jet beside the F-35 right now. The stealth technology and the advanced radar and the threat detection system makes me more capable so I can strike first and it makes it so that my pilots are more survivable in war time." The federal Liberal government promised during last year's election campaign that it would hold an open competition to replace Canada's aging CF-18 fleet, but it also pledged not to buy the F-35. Former prime minister Stephen Harper said in 2010 Canada would buy 64 of the stealth fighters, a commitment that was derailed when the Liberals came to power last year. Lockheed Martin, the U.S.-based defence contractor overseeing the F-35's development, has since asked the Canadian government for the chance to compete in an open and fair competition to provide the next generation of airplanes to Canada's military. Still, the federal government paid more than $30 million earlier this year to remain part of a consortium of nine countries backing the development of the fifth-generation aircraft. Canada has contributed more than $311 million to the group, which ensures it an eventual discount to buy the jet as well as access in the meantime to lucrative development contracts. The government said Canadian companies have received US$812 million in contracts since Canada's first F-35 payment in 1997. The rival aircraft vying to become Canada's next fighter jet is Boeing's F/A-18 Super Hornet, which was also scheduled to make an appearance at Abbotsford's air show. A published report earlier this year said the Liberals had decided to purchase the Super Hornet as an interim measure to buy time for landing on a long-term fix for the Air Force. That prompted an outcry from the Opposition Conservatives over what they described as a rigged process that allowed Boeing to "jump the queue." Canada bought its current fleet of CF-18s in the 1980s. The jets were designed to last 20 years, but the former Conservative government opted to spend $400 million to overhaul the fleet to keep the 77 aircraft in operation until at least 2025. — Follow @gwomand on Twitter You Might Like Facebook Page People Donald Trump Jared Kushner Barack Obama Kanye West José Mourinho Current Topics Attorney General Volkswagen Jeff Sessions Buckingham Palace Spotlight 📺 Live TV 📺 ONP TV Movie Reviews Totally Aesthetic Staff Stories DOCTOR WHO: Is Season 10 The Last For Peter Capaldi?

An Atlas 5 rocket was to carry WorldView-4 into orbit from Vandenberg Air Force Base. The satellite is designed to produce high-resolution images of Earth. The fire in a remote canyon didn’t immediately threaten the space launch complex, Col. Paul Nosek said on the base’s Facebook page. But he said firefighters were not available to stand by at the launch. Nearly 800 firefighters were trying to corral the fire that was slightly less than a square mile. The launch will be postponed until at least Sept. 26, according to United Launch Alliance, a joint venture by Lockheed Martin and Boeing Co. The satellite is the latest in a series of imaging satellites built by Lockheed Martin. Operated by Colorado-based DigitalGlobe, which provides images for government and private customers, it is designed to spot the make of a car from nearly 400 miles above Earth.

Mobile phone users rarely consider the mini power plants that keep their devices multi-tasking all day. Now those rechargeable lithium-ion batteries are big news. Samsung Electronics Co. is ending production of its big-screen Galaxy Note 7 following more than 100 reports of fires or explosions, which affected even some of the replacement phones distributed after a recall. As batteries have gotten both smaller and more powerful, lithium-ion woes have been popping up more frequently. The batteries that power much of the information economy have led to recalls of laptops, bans of hoverboards and a delayed jetliner debut. 1. Why are Samsung phones catching fire? The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission said the compartment for the battery is a little too small and pinches the battery, causing short circuits and overheating. Samsung previously said that a manufacturing flaw brings negative and positive poles into contact, triggering excessive heat. The company said in a different report that a piece of technology that separates the electrodes might be thinning out, leading to short-circuiting. While the company had said the problem was isolated to one supplier, fires were reported on replacements as well, leading to the decision to end production entirely. 2. Why didn’t the phones just stop working? The Note 7 features a larger battery than its predecessor, one that can store 3500 milliamp hours of electric power, compared with 3000 mAh for the Note 5. More power means more danger when something goes wrong. Rather than simply malfunction, these batteries have enough stored energy to catch fire or explode. 3. Are other phones dangerous? Potentially, but it’s a long-shot. The iPhone 7 Plus, the Note 7’s main competitor, has a less-powerful 2900 mAh battery, which reduces the danger if the battery malfunctions. In general, lithium-ion batteries are safe because manufacturers have gone through rigorous testing of the designs. But smartphone makers have pressed for smaller and more powerful battery packs, as well as a fast-charging feature, which puts additional stress on the batteries. A number of other phones have that feature, while the iPhone does not. 4. How do lithium-ion batteries work? Lithium ions move from the negative pole (anode) to the positive pole (cathode) while discharging and vice versa while charging. Between the electrodes is a liquid chemical, an electrolyte, and a permeable membrane, a separator, that allows only ions to pass through. One way to increase the power capacity has been to make that separator thinner, increasing the chance that the wall will be penetrated, according to Martin Reynolds, a vice president at research firm Gartner.  5. How else have lithium-ion batteries caused problems? A Sony Corp.-made battery pack that overheated led to the recall of millions of laptops made by Dell Inc., Toshiba Corp. and others in 2006. Problems with the batteries also triggered a global grounding during the debut of the Boeing Co.’s 787 Dreamliner in 2013. Earlier this year, about 500,000 hoverboards were recalled in the U.S. by 10 companies after reports of overheating, sparks and fire. 6. How did Samsung respond?

That includes any new replacement device they received due to the recall. Samsung is offering to give users all their money back, or they can exchange their phone for a Galaxy S7, with Samsung refunding the difference. 7. What does this mean for Samsung? The end of the Note 7 represents a big setback for the South Korean electronics giant in its battle with Apple, whose iPhone 7 hit stores in September. The Note 7 stood out with its stylus, large edge-to-edge display, iris scanner and better waterproofing techniques. Along with the S7, it was the device that Samsung pitched at premium users to battle Apple. The Note 7 was rolled out in August, just before Apple unveiled the iPhone 7. Samsung has now lost much of the momentum it built in smartphone sales. Instead of celebrating a triumphant launch of a premium product, the company has had to deal with consumer complaints and employees’ feelings of humiliation and the death of a product that fueled earnings in its semiconductor and display businesses. Now it needs to recover its reputation. The Reference Shelf What to do with your Note 7. A story on the perils of building better batteries. An explainer on batteries.

Like all people, we want a secure home, steady income, healthy kids, and good meals. As liberals, we'd like everyone to enjoy these, but our own comfort tops the list. We care about poor people in distant lands, but vote for those who kill them. We condemn exploitation of peasant labor and land, but enjoy the products they make. We deplore destruction of the environment but devour its bounty. We sign petitions, march with signs, read liberal news, write checks to right wrongs. Genuine caring, though, is risky. Justice requires social change that's bold and deep. This means living and voting very differently. Many of my friends will vote for Hillary because she is a woman or because she is not Trump. Few will vote for her because she is liberal, because instead both she and Trump, technically speaking, are fascists. Fascism is the merger of government and large corporations. Together these dominate law, labor, money, military, media, and politics. During the past 40 years, through corporate mergers and immense political contributions, our country has become extensively fascistic. Our freedom becomes bounded more by corporations than by Constitutions. Nazism is fascism that dominates by exterminating dissent, and attacking nations without first being attacked. This is "aggressive war," the chief war crime for which Nazi leaders were hung. By these international standards, most U.S. presidents since William McKinley have been war criminals. Most recently, LBJ, Nixon, Reagan, Bill Clinton, both Bushes and Obama have approved various war crimes. This is easy to do, with 900 military bases worldwide. Our country has bombed 30 countries since World War Two, none of which attacked us. During Bill Clinton's presidency (1993-2001), for example, hundreds of thousands of Iraqi children died from his embargo. Corporate control of media and the military ensured you did not see them die on television. Clinton's extraordinarily racist "three strikes" law and TANF legislation led to an explosion of the African-American prison population and family collapse. But Bill is a Democrat, so liberals admire him still. Hillary stood by Bill, then while Secretary of State pushed her own attacks on Libya, Syria, Yemen. The Clinton Foundation bagged millions of dollars from some of the world's worst dictators-- Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Algeria, Oman, the Emirates-- and some of the most toxic corporations-- Monsanto, ExxonMobil, Dow Chemical, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, NRG Energy, Pfizer, Boeing. Now as candidate for president she is backed by her "friend" Henry Kissinger, a war criminal. She would likewise revive the Cold War with Russia. She has threatened to "obliterate" Iran. Others are welcome to vote for Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump, but both Trump and Hillary will continue America's decay. Trump will shred our flag by dividing us by race and religion. Hillary will aggravate every problem by serving the industries that have been dragging us down-- the military-industrial complex, the prison industry, agribusiness, big pharma, big oil and fracking, predatory banks, medical insurers, job loss by globalization, and global warming. - Advertisement - Every society, including ours, contains the seed of fascism, ready to sprout from fear and anger. We were taught after World War 2 that "just following orders" made us "good Germans" but bad Americans. We were taught pride in America's revolutionary history and our obligation to speak against tyranny. We were taught that obedience to evil makes one evil. So I do not vote for war criminals. And I say so though many friends disagree. Trump would harm us unpredictably. Hillary would harm us systematically. Neither is inclined to push back. They are both creatures of this machine. Such a situation reduces voting to a noble folly. Even when there are worthy candidates, elections are corrupted by slush money, closed debates, hacked voting machines and crooked voting officials. Many liberals vote for fascists because for decades they have rejected third parties. They've narrowed their choices to fascists by repeatedly relying on a Democratic Party that is abandoning liberalism. Just as the Republican Party is no longer the party of Lincoln, the Democratic Party is no longer the party of FDR. Today, Republicans throw us off the cliff, while Democrats escort us politely over the edge. Liberals have also allowed this decline because many of us depend on the very institutions which threaten us. We seek to conserve our remaining privileges as consumers benefitting from a global military empire. The Democratic Party invites us to believe they are at least comparatively humane. Every year, however, the Party becomes less humane, less liberal, and less democratic. - Advertisement - The challenge of replacing fascist parties, and fascist politicians regardless of their gender, color, religion, style, promises, or charm is thus up to us, not to them. I will vote for Jill Stein, but real change will come through revolution. Nonviolent revolution requires us to rely less on the corporations that rule elections. We do this by leaving the Middle Class to become the Mutual Class. What is the Mutual Class? We build grassroots eco-housing on land trusts, we start local health co-ops, we invest in regional organic farms, green schools, promote transit and biking, credit unions, state banks, regional stock exchanges, and local currencies. We own the essential systems that keep us alive, and manage them co-operatively. We take control of the economy, starting where we live. We focus on creating, more than consuming. There is no shortcut to restoring our liberties. While the Middle Class goes further into debt, the Mutual Class gets ahead by getting together.

Iran provisionally agreed earlier this year to buy over 200 jets worth $50 billion at list prices from Airbus and Boeing under an agreement between Tehran and world powers to ease sanctions in exchange for curbs on Iran's nuclear activities. Be the first to know - Join our Facebook page. Both deals hinge on the longer-than-expected process of winning US Treasury approval, which is needed due to the high proportion of US parts in virtually all modern jetliners, including those made by Europe's Airbus.

More here from The Wall Street Journal: “The cease-fire in Syria was in jeopardy on Sunday as clashes escalated the day after the U.S.-led coalition targeting Islamic State mistakenly killed dozens of Syrian government forces in an airstrike. Both the Syrian government and rebels accused each other of violating the truce. Rebels said the regime and its Russian allies restarted airstrikes on opposition fighters in the northern city of Aleppo, the epicenter of the war in recent months. Story Continued Below “The Russian defense ministry said Sunday the situation in Aleppo was ‘especially tense,’ but added Syrian government forces hadn’t broken the cease-fire or responded to fire from opposition forces. The airstrike added to the tension and led to charges and countercharges between Washington and Moscow, which back opposite sides in the conflict and brokered the cease-fire.” — U.S. SAYS STRIKE BELIEVED TO BE TARGETING ISIL: The U.S. Central Command issued a statement saying that U.S.-led forces “believed they were striking a Da’esh fighting position that they had been tracking for a significant amount of time before the strike.” “The coalition airstrike was halted immediately when coalition officials were informed by Russian officials that it was possible the personnel and vehicles targeted were part of the Syrian military,” the statement said. “Coalition forces would not intentionally strike a known Syrian military unit.” — AIRSTRIKE ON SYRIAN TROOPS WEAKENS U.S. EFFORTS TO CURB VIOLENCE, writes The New York Times: “The United States’ accidental bombing of Syrian troops over the weekend has put it on the defensive, undercutting American efforts to reduce violence in the civil war and open paths for humanitarian relief. The United States had thought that if a deal to ease hostilities in Syria, struck by Secretary of State John Kerry and his Russian counterpart in Geneva nine days ago, fell apart, it would reveal Russia’s duplicity in the war, in which Moscow has supported the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad. “Instead, the mistaken bombing — American pilots thought they were aiming at Islamic State jihadists but instead killed more than 60 Syrian soldiers, according to the Russian military — again exposed the White House’s struggle to put together a coherent strategy in a multisided war. The United States has conflicting aims in the war, from defeating the Islamic State to ultimately easing Mr. Assad out of office.” BOMBS IN NORTHEAST, STABBINGS IN MINNESOTA RAISE TERROR FEARS ON THE HOME FRONT: A pair of bombings in Manhattan and New Jersey on Saturday and stabbings at a Minnesota mall — along with more bombs found at a New Jersey train station Sunday evening — are heightening terrorism concerns in the U.S. The Associated Press has the latest on the Northeast bombings here: "Authorities are looking for a naturalized Afghanistan citizen for questioning in a weekend explosion in a Manhattan neighborhood that injured 29 people as the governor conceded Monday that investigators could no longer rule out international terrorism. "The man sought for questioning was identified as 28-year-old Ahmad Khan Rahami. Mayor Bill de Blasio said he could be armed and dangerous. 'We need to get this guy in right away,' de Blasio said on CNN. "My experience is one the FBI zeroes in on someone, they will get them." — MANHATTAN BOMBS DESIGNED TO BE DEADLY, writes the NYT: “A bomb that injured 29 people on Saturday in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan, and another that failed to detonate, were filled with shrapnel and made with pressure cookers, flip phones and Christmas lights to set off a powerful explosive compound, law enforcement officials said on Sunday. Both bombs appeared designed to create maximum chaos and fatalities. They also provided a trove of clues.” — FIVE DEVICES FOUND IN NEW JERSEY, via NJ Advance Media: “An explosive device in a backpack detonated near the Elizabeth, N.J., train station early Monday as authorities were using a bomb robot to examine the item, officials said. … The explosion was not a controlled blast, but happened as the robot was cutting the device, according to Mayor Christian Bollwage. No one was injured in the blast, Bollwage said. Authorities found five devices inside a single backpack near the train station, including one that went off.” — THE ISLAMIC STATE CLAIMS CREDIT FOR MINNESOTA STABBINGS, writes the Star Tribune: “The claim, broadcast Sunday on social media, had a familiar ring: The man who stabbed nine people before being killed by an off-duty police officer in a St. Cloud mall on Saturday was ‘a soldier of the Islamic State.’ His attack, the message continued, was an ‘operation in response to calls to target the citizens of the crusader coalition.’ The Amaq News Agency, media wing of the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant, has used nearly identical language in taking credit for at least a half dozen other attacks in Western countries in recent months, analysts say.” IT’S MONDAY AND WELCOME TO MORNING DEFENSE, where we want to wish the Air Force a happy belated 69th birthday (It was on Sunday).

Learn more at acibc.org ** HAPPENING TODAY — AFA CONFERENCE KICKS OFF: The Air Force Association Air, Space and Cyber conference kicks off at the Gaylord National Resort and Convention Center in Maryland, where the big news likely this morning will be the official name of the B-21 bomber. Air Force Secretary Deborah Lee James is expected to make the announcement in her “State of the Force” address. “Tune in to my keynote Monday morning at 1020 for an update on the state of the force. And maybe an announcement,” she tweeted, adding a winking emoji at the end. WHAT’S IN A NAME? We want to hear your thoughts about the name once it’s out. Email Morning D (jherb@politico.com) with your praise, criticism and perhaps some humor. ALSO TODAY AT AFA: James and Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. David Goldfein speak this afternoon at an Air Force town hall, and Air Force Global Strike Command chief Gen. Robin Rand discusses the B-21 bomber on an afternoon panel. The full three-day conference agenda is here, and a livestream is here. Our colleague Ellen Mitchell will be on the ground at the AFA convention with the latest, and you can follow her on Twitter here. ALSO THIS WEEK — U.N. GENERAL ASSEMBLY IN NEW YORK: President Barack Obama is in New York for the U.N. General Assembly, which will make for an interesting dynamic in the wake of the latest Syrian developments. In addition to the speeches — Obama’s last U.N. General Assembly address — the president will be holding a bilateral meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the White House said Sunday. He’ll also be meeting with the Iraqi prime minister to discuss Mosul. 2016 WATCH — TRUMP VS. ROBERT GATES: Donald Trump added a new target for scorn at his rally Saturday: former Defense Secretary Robert Gates. After insulting Gates on Twitter Saturday morning, Trump called him “a clown” Saturday evening. "We had a clown today, an absolute clown, Robert Gates," Trump said at his rally in Colorado Springs, adding he “probably has a problem we don't know about." Why is Trump going after Gates? The former defense secretary in both the Obama and George W. Bush administrations wrote an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal attacking Trump for being “cavalier about the use of nuclear weapons” and being “willfully ignorant” about the world. “When it comes to credibility problems, though, Donald Trump is in a league of his own,” Gates wrote. PROGRAMMATIC PROBLEMS — 15 F-35s GROUNDED OVER INSULATION ISSUE, via The Washington Post: “Less than two months after declaring the controversial F-35 Joint Strike Fighter ready for combat, the Air Force on Friday announced that it was temporarily grounding 15 of the jets after it discovered that insulation was ‘peeling and crumbling’ inside the fuel tanks. … In a statement, Lockheed Martin said that ‘the issue is confined to one supplier source and one batch of parts.’ It emphasized that ‘this is not a technical or design issue; it is a supply chain manufacturing quality issue.’” — AND THE FORD CARRIER HAS A POWER PROBLEM, reports Defense News: “For over a year, the U.S. Navy and its shipbuilders have been anxious to get the new aircraft carrier Gerald R. Ford (CVN 78) to sea and begin engineering trials of the first-of-class design. A number of publicly-announced target dates have come and gone, but the ship is still firmly moored at Newport News Shipbuilding in Virginia. “Now, however, a key factor in preventing the ship from casting off lines and getting underway is coming into view. A serious voltage regulator problem on the carrier’s four main turbine generators (MTGs) has prevented engineers from running the motors up to full power, and only now has the problem been identified and a fix decided upon.” EVENT ALERT- OUTSIDE, IN: Join POLITICO and featured guests: AARP Public Policy Institute’s Jean Accius, ChenMed’s Jessica Chen, NaviMed’s Bijan Salehizadeh, U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs’ Kenneth Shay, and U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ Edwin Walker for a discussion on whether tech can transform aging in America.

The SpaceX CEO took to Twitter Friday evening to say the Colonial Transporter needed a new name, as it might be travelling to different spots in the solar system besides Mars. “Turns out MCT can go well beyond Mars, so will need a new name.” Turns out MCT can go well beyond Mars, so will need a new name… — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) September 17, 2016 Musk was flooded with suggestions with Twitter users proposing names like Heart of Gold, Zaphod Beeblebrox’s stolen ship in Douglas Adams’ The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy, and Colonial One from Battlestar Galactica. Other suggestions include Millennium, Ultimate Mars Ship II, Snickers, Marathon, Indestructible II, from the game Orion Trail, and Booster McBoosterface. The next day Musk had his name; he dubbed his new spacecraft the Interplanetary Transport System (ITS). The ITS is capable of carrying 100 tons of cargo or 100 people to Mars or beyond. The red planet isn’t the only place in the solar system worth colonizing, its just the most popular. Humans could establish other offworld colonies in places like Venus, the moon, the asteroid Ceres, and possibly the moons around the outer planets. Musk didn’t go into further details about the range of the Colonial Transporter, nor did he imply SpaceX has any further goals of establishing more colonies on more worlds than Mars. He has, however, promised to reveal many of his plans for a Martian colony at the upcoming International Astronautical Congress in Mexico on Sept. 27. (Photo by NASA via Getty Images) During the conference, Musk is scheduled to deliver the keynote address entitled “Making Humans a Multiplanetary Species.” The SpaceX Colonial Transporter is slated to make an unmanned test flight to Mars, which will be followed by one with human passengers in 2024. Musk has warned would-be red planet settlers that the first Earth Mars transits’ will be difficult and dangerous, according to the International Business Times. “It’s dangerous and probably people will die – and they’ll know that. And then they’ll pave the way, and ultimately it will be very safe to go to Mars, and it will be very comfortable.” <noscript><iframe width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xaSimiNLJp4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></noscript> The news about Musk renaming his Colonial Transporter comes after the recent explosion of a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket on its launch pad during a test earlier this month, which rocked the space travel industry. The resulting fire destroyed the $62 million reusable rocket and the $200 million satellite it was carrying. The investigation into the cause of the explosion, caused when an anomaly in the rocket’s second stage sparked a massive fireball, is sure to delay the SpaceX launch schedule. That’s bad news for SpaceX customers who have been waiting to have their satellites flown into orbit, but it may also slow down SpaceX’s own test flight schedule and delay construction of a future Mars colony. SpaceX isn’t the only company looking to capitalize on the renewed interest in space travel. Already, one company is building an asteroid-mining spacecraft with the goal of extracting valuable resources from passing space rocks. (Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images) They would fit well in the cislunar economy that United Launch Alliance is establishing in low-Earth orbit. The partnership between Lockheed Martin and Boeing envisions 1,000 people living and working in space within our lifetime. With NASA planning to abandon the International Space Station in the 2020s and divert federal funds to a manned Mars mission, it will need a commercial interest to take over its responsibilities. The space station could find itself as the new hub of a cislunar economy, as it becomes a gas station in orbit receiving loads of cargo from ULA space trucks and trading supplies for resources mined from passing asteroids.
