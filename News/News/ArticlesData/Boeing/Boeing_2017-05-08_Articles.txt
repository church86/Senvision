The low cost carrier (LCC) is currently working out the economies of this model and says return fares could be about Rs 25,000 to places like London, Paris and Amsterdam in all-economy seating wide body aircraft. Return fares on these sectors is mostly upwards of Rs 40,000 on full service Indian and foreign airlines, especially in peak travel seasons. This January SpiceJet had placed an order for up to 205 Boeing aircraft — 155 B-737 and an optional order for 50 more that was a mix of wide and narrow body planes. "We are evaluating the low cost long haul model for which an optional order for wide body planes has been placed. There is a good market for this segment in India if a good product is offered at the right price. Imagine the demand that a fare of Rs 10,000-15,000 on Delhi-London will have," SpiceJet chairman Ajay Singh had said on January 13 while signing the deal with Boeing. The airline has made headway with those plans and shared some key features with TOI. "SpiceJet will follow the same low cost/no frills model on its long haul routes as it does on its domestic and short haul international sectors where passengers pay for additional services like meals, seat selection, priority check-in, priority boarding and excess baggage. However, unlike some other international LCCs, the first (check-in) bag would be free of charge," said a SpiceJet official. A leading international long haul LCC, for instance charges $32 for a check-in bag of up to 20 kg — one way -- on its India-Southeast Asia flights. So if SpiceJet is able to offer this service at no extra cost, that will be significant saving for flyers. "SpiceJet plans to have 350-380 seats on a Boeing 787 Dreamliner. It would be an all-economy class configuration with few select rows of SpiceMax seats offering extra leg room. Full service Air India has 256 seats on its Dreamliners with 18 in business class. (With this seating capacity) if we can cap return fares at levels of about Rs 25,000, many would prefer a European vacation when a domestic return ticket can cost the same during peak season," said another SpiceJet official, adding that the LCC is looking at London, Birmingham, Paris, Amsterdam, Frankfurt and Zurich as the possible destinations. It will offer in flight entertainment on its flights from later this year. The airline did not give a firm date for starting these flights. "SpiceJet continues to study the viability of low-cost long haul travel and a decision will be taken in due course," said Ajay Singh. However, actual fares will depend on oil prices when SpiceJet launches these flights. Indian LCCs — IndiGo, SpiceJet and GoAir — have narrow body planes like B-737 and Airbus A-320 in their fleet. IndiGo and SpiceJet operate to nearby foreign countries like Gulf and Southeast Asia and GoAir also plans to do the same. But as of now, no Indian budget airlines flies long haul. On the other hand, foreign LCCs offer connections to as far as Australia and eastern Europe through their hubs in Dubai and Singapore and Indians are already flying long haul on them. The biggest foreign LCCs currently operating to India are Singapore-based Scoot and Tiger (both part of Singapore Airlines' Group); Kuala Lumpur-based AirAsia; Dubai-based flydubai and Sharjah's Air Arabia. While the SIA budget carriers offer connections to China, Southeast Asia and Australia from their hub, the Gulf LCCs do so to eastern Europe, West Asia and Africa. In fact, flydubai gets a significant transfer traffic for its Europe flights from India. Indian LCCs like SpiceJet now want a share of the growing pie of long haul budget travel to and from the country.

This is at least the third attempt by the Chinese to build a commercial passenger aircraft that can successfully compete with Western manufacturers. “It’s like watching a competitor creep up on you at a snail’s pace and not necessarily moving in a straight line,” said Richard Aboulafia, vice president of analysis at Virginia-based industry consultancy Teal Group. Last Friday, a 158-seat jetliner built by the state-owned Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China took its maiden flight from Shanghai. The Chinese press hailed the flight of the so-called C919 passenger aircraft as a sign of the country’s growing influence and manufacturing prowess, though experts say it still faces significant hurdles. The C919 is a narrow-body twinjet similar in size to Boeing’s 737 or the Airbus A320. The Chinese passenger jet has been under development since 2008, and its maiden flight was about three years behind schedule. The C919 will be assembled in China, with some technology from Western partners, including affiliates of Honeywell and General Electric . “There’s an expectation of reliability in the components, but the US$64,000 question is the quality of the assembly [on the C919],” said Moody’s analyst Jonathan Root. China has been trying to break into the commercial jetliner business for decades. The Chinese developed a narrow-body jet known as the Y-10 in the 1970s, though it was considered a Boeing 707 knockoff. Then in 2008 China’s regional jet, known as the ARJ21 — featuring up to 90 seats — made its maiden flight and last June began commercial operations. “If the Chinese were doing anything except what they’re doing I think the Western manufacturers would be terrified,” said Aboulafia. “They are taking a convoluted and at times a counterproductive approach to developing this industry.” Aboulafia believes there are two “fundamental” mistakes the Chinese made in developing the C919. First, he believes the heavy hand of a state-owned enterprise is the wrong approach to cracking into the global commercial aircraft business. Second, he maintains that partnering with Western equipment manufacturers under preconditions such as a requirement of Chinese manufacturing will add risk and ultimately not bring the most current technology, due to intellectual property concerns. “Basically, they’re telling them they have no intellectual property protection,” said Aboulafia. “This means you have Western manufacturers sometimes showing up with the ‘latest and best’ from 1985.” CNBC reached out to GE and Honeywell for comment. According to reports, the C919 secured at least 570 orders from Air China and several other Chinese-based carriers as well as a handful of foreign airlines. The Chinese previously stated that they intended to sell more than 2,000 of the aircraft over two decades after the jet entered into service. Analysts say major Western carriers are likely to be hesitant to switch to a Chinese plane solely to save costs. “If I’m running a fleet for a U.S. airline or a European airline, I’m going to want to observe the reliability of the airplane — its efficacy in service, its operating profile, its reliability and so on,” said Root. “I think that would have to take a number of years being in service in order for me to consider inducting that aircraft into the fleet.” The C919 received a flight permit last month from the Civil Aviation Administration of China. It still requires certification from U.S. and EU safety agencies to fly in those markets. Even so, looking out five to 10 years from now the Moody’s analyst said he believes the established airlines will stick with Boeing and Airbus rather than the C919. “From our perspective, it’s a long time away before it might become a risk,” said Root. If the C919 does take off in terms of sales, however, Boeing could potentially see its China business start to decline. The strongest demand for Boeing’s commercial planes is for its narrow-body models. In October, Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg told analysts on the company’s earnings call that it sees China as “a US$1 trillion market opportunity” in terms of commercial planes over the next 20 years. Boeing’s total commercial order book had just over 5,700 planes through April, with the Asia market identified as having about 1,300 planes and China having 323. There are about 1,000 planes in Boeing’s backlog that are not identified, so it’s possible a portion of those are also for the Chinese market.

Double top levels are resistance points in technical analysis. They are often catalysts for pullbacks and that is what I expect on Boeing Co. Until this point, Boeing was bullish. Now the chart analysis tells us to flip it to bearish. The pullback target can be as low as $169.00 as first target and $161.00 as second target.

The unmanned Boeing X-37B landed at NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida on Sunday, after making a sonic boom that could be heard from miles away. The space plane was launched from the nearby Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in May 2015, aboard an Atlas 5 rocket built by United Launch Alliance (ULA), a partnership between Lockheed Martin Corp and Boeing. This was the spacecraft's first landing in Florida. All the previous missions had landed in California's Vandenberg Air Force Base. The orbiter spent 718 days in the space, setting a new on-orbit endurance record. Overall, the two X-37Bs built so far have spent 2,085 days in space. Also known as Orbital Test Vehicle (OTV), the 29-feet-long drone was first launched into space in April 2010 and returned after eight months. It was sent on a second mission in March 2011 and remained in space for 15 months. The spacecraft set on its third mission in December 2012 and returned after 22 months. Brigadier General Wayne Monteith, commander of the 45th Space Wing, thanked his forces for conducting the last mission. "Our team has been preparing for this event for several years, and I am extremely proud to see our hard work and dedication culminate in today's safe and successful landing of the X-37B," he said in a statement. According to the USAF, the reusable plane "performs risk reduction, experimentation and concept of operations development for reusable space vehicle technologies." This is while, military analysts say the spacecraft will be ultimately used for spying activities. The Secure World Foundation, a nonprofit promoting the peaceful exploration of space, says the US military is using the platform to test intelligence-related hardware. The USAF is planning to launch the fifth X-37B mission from Cape Canaveral air force station later this year. "The ability to land, refurbish, and launch from the same location further enhances the OTV's ability to rapidly integrate and qualify new space technologies," said Monteith.

GE and Honeywell are among Western partners supplying technology to the new Chinese passenger jet. Jeff Daniels | @jeffdanielsca 8 Hours AgoCNBC.com SHARES show chapters China's first giant passenger jet takes its maiden test flight    Friday, 5 May 2017 | 5:35 PM ET | 01:18 China's domestic airlines have been major buyers of large passenger aircraft from Airbus and Boeing but the Western manufacturers shouldn't lose sleep over China's ambitions in the market, according to analysts. This is at least the third attempt by the Chinese to build a commercial passenger aircraft that can successfully compete with Western manufacturers. "It's like watching a competitor creep up on you at a snail's pace and not necessarily moving in a straight line," said Richard Aboulafia, vice president of analysis at Virginia-based industry consultancy Teal Group. Last Friday, a 158-seat jetliner built by the state-owned Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China took its maiden flight from Shanghai. The Chinese press hailed the flight of the so-called C919 passenger aircraft as a sign of the country's growing influence and manufacturing prowess, though experts say it still faces significant hurdles. The C919 is a narrow-body twinjet similar in size to Boeing's 737 or the Airbus A320. The Chinese passenger jet has been under development since 2008, and its maiden flight was about three years behind schedule. The C919 will be assembled in China, with some technology from Western partners, including affiliates of Honeywell and General Electric. "There's an expectation of reliability in the components, but the $64,000 question is the quality of the assembly [on the C919]," said Moody's analyst Jonathan Root. China has been trying to break into the commercial jetliner business for decades. The Chinese developed a narrow-body jet known as the Y-10 in the 1970s, though it was considered a Boeing 707 knockoff. Then in 2008 China's regional jet, known as the ARJ21 — featuring up to 90 seats — made its maiden flight and last June began commercial operations. "If the Chinese were doing anything except what they're doing I think the Western manufacturers would be terrified," said Aboulafia. "They are taking a convoluted and at times a counterproductive approach to developing this industry." Aboulafia believes there are two "fundamental" mistakes the Chinese made in developing the C919. First, he believes the heavy hand of a state-owned enterprise is the wrong approach to cracking into the global commercial aircraft business. Second, he maintains that partnering with Western equipment manufacturers under preconditions such as a requirement of Chinese manufacturing will add risk and ultimately not bring the most current technology, due to intellectual property concerns. "Basically, they're telling them they have no intellectual property protection," said Aboulafia. "This means you have Western manufacturers sometimes showing up with the 'latest and best' from 1985." CNBC reached out to GE and Honeywell for comment. According to reports, the C919 secured at least 570 orders from Air China and several other Chinese-based carriers as well as a handful of foreign airlines. The Chinese previously stated that they intended to sell more than 2,000 of the aircraft over two decades after the jet entered into service. Analysts say major Western carriers are likely to be hesitant to switch to a Chinese plane solely to save costs. "If I'm running a fleet for a U.S. airline or a European airline, I'm going to want to observe the reliability of the airplane — its efficacy in service, its operating profile, its reliability and so on," said Root. "I think that would have to take a number of years being in service in order for me to consider inducting that aircraft into the fleet." The C919 received a flight permit last month from the Civil Aviation Administration of China. It still requires certification from U.S. and EU safety agencies to fly in those markets. Even so, looking out five to 10 years from now the Moody's analyst said he believes the established airlines will stick with Boeing and Airbus rather than the C919. "From our perspective, it's a long time away before it might become a risk," said Root. If the C919 does take off in terms of sales, however, Boeing could potentially see its China business start to decline. The strongest demand for Boeing's commercial planes is for its narrow-body models. In October, Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg told analysts on the company's earnings call that it sees China as "a $1 trillion market opportunity" in terms of commercial planes over the next 20 years. Boeing's total commercial order book had just over 5,700 planes through April, with the Asia market identified as having about 1,300 planes and China having 323. There are about 1,000 planes in Boeing's backlog that are not identified, so it's possible a portion of those are also for the Chinese market.

Last week, the final 2017 federal budget allotted $1.1 billion for 14 new Super Hornet fighter jets. While it wasn't the 24 fighter jets at $2.3 billion the president had proposed in his supplemental budget proposal, it marked a win nonetheless: the original Defense Department budget proposal, released early last year, had requested none. "We always thought that the Navy buying additional Super Hornets made sense because they need airplanes to last into the 2040s," said Dan Gillian, head of Boeing's (NYSE: BA) F/A-18 and EA-18 programs. Of course Boeing would think that — and it may have made sense. Still, until recently, the F-18 program had been viewed by many to be a production line on life support, as newer planes including Lockheed Martin's (NYSE: LMT) F-35 Joint Strike Fighter roll off assembly lines and into future U.S. carrier air wings. Now, "St. Louis and the fighter business stays on for the next round of programs," said Richard Aboulafia, vice president of analysis at Virginia-based industry consultancy Teal Group. "It didn't look like that would be the case a year ago. Super Hornet orders had been expected to be down by end of decade." Boeing's St. Louis, Missouri-based F-18 assembly line complex is currently turning out EA-18G Growlers, the jamming planes outfitted from Super Hornets, for the fiscal 2015 budget year. That year the Navy only ordered Growlers. The following year's budget included five Super Hornets, but the 2017 budget that just passed through Congress is the one that will prove to be an inflection point. "Today we're producing two shipsets per month — Super Hornets and Growlers — in this factory," said Gillian, clad in safety goggles as he walks the plant floor, past stations stocked with workers and plane parts. "As we think about the U.S. Navy's demands for additional airplanes to address the Super Hornet shortfall, as we think about their international demands, we can see that going up to 3 or 4 per month sometime in the early 20s," he said. Boeing anticipates the U.S. Navy will purchase at least another 100 F/A-18s in the five budget cycles beginning with 2018, ensuring its place on aircraft carriers through the next two decades. The long game, however, isn't the plane it's gearing up to manufacture for its 2016 and 2017 orders. Rather, it's the adoption of a new version called "Block III," which Boeing hopes the Navy will opt for before the decade is out. Block III has a longer life cycle, and more advanced avionics that would better complement the F-35C, EA-18G Growler, and other planes comprising the air wing. The aircraft would act as a smart "node" on the naval fighter "network," Gillian said. Block III is based off of the Advanced Super Hornet the company first unveiled in 2013, though today's version focuses less on stealth and more on capability. The general idea: a stealthy F-35 could conduct short-range reconnaissance and transmit that data back to the Super Hornet, which loaded with weapons, could pack the needed punch from farther away. It's this plane that Trump likely had in mind when he asked Boeing to price a "comparable" plane to the fifth generation, stealthy F-35 — a move that caused industry experts to balk but also spurred a Pentagon review of the two fighters' operational capabilities. Still Gillian is quick to stress that Boeing has been engaged in F/A-18 discussions with the Navy for years now, amid inventory shortages. Earlier this year, Navy officials disclosed that two out of every three F-18 fighter planes in its fleet are out of commission on any given day, awaiting repairs. They've been flown hard in a post-9-11 world, which coupled with maintenance backlogs tied to budget cuts, has resulted in a serious maintenance bottleneck for all planes. That coupled with delays for the naval variant of the F-35, which is now expected to be operational in 2018, and the Navy faces a fighter jet shortfall. This is the reason, analysts point out, the service has been pursuing more Super Hornet purchases as it pairs back F-35C orders — even before Trump entered the Oval Office. Read More Aboulafia said over the past five years, the Navy has requested about five times as many Super Hornets as F-35Cs. Boeing has also developed a service life modification program to extend flight hours from 6,000 up to 9,000 for the more than 560 planes the Navy already operates, as the oldest Super Hornets begin to hit that max threshold in 2018. Cost and timing will likely continue to dictate where future defense dollars go. "The F/A-18 is the legacy fighter and the F-35 is the new fighter. The new fighter is going to have some improvements over the legacy fighter. It's going to be stealthier… and have a longer range. But those factors come at a price and I think President Trump has made it very clear that he's looking for the lowest price possible," said John Eade, president and senior analyst at New York-based Argus Research. The Super Hornet currently costs between $70 million and $75 million, according to Boeing. An advanced version will add $3 million to that price tag. By comparison, the naval variant of the F-35 is $121 million, according to the most recent government contract. Boeing is pouncing on that cost component. In a one-page white paper obtained by Defense One, the company makes the argument for the Defense Department to buy more of its new advanced F/A-18s and fewer F-35Cs, suggesting the move would save tens of billions of dollars over 20 years.

 How the Air Force plans to keep the legendary B-52 Stratofortress flying for 100 years Jared Keller, Task & Purpose May 8, 2017, 4:18 PM 7,099 facebook linkedin twitter email print A B-52 drops a load of bombs in Afghanistan. U.S. Air Force/Master Sgt. Ralph Hallmon/AP That the B-52 Stratofortress is still in service for the U.S. Air Force is something of a minor miracle. Designed by Boeing, the 160-foot-long strategic bombers weren’t much to look at when the first operational prototype took flight in 1952, earning the new class of bomber the unofficial nickname “BUFF” — short for “Big Ugly Fat Fuckers.” But for decades, the B-52 has remained the backbone of America’s global military presence, from relentlessly trolling the nuclear-armed Soviet Union and bombarding enemy forces during the Vietnam War to providing close air support in modern conflicts from Serbia and Yugoslavia to Iraq and Afghanistan. According to the Air Force, B-52s delivered 40% of all the weapons dropped by coalition forces during Operation Desert Storm in 1991. “The long rifle was the great weapon of its day,” Air Force Chief of Staff General Nathan Twining reportedly declared during the unveiling of the first 10 B-52Bs to enter into service in March 1954. “Today, this B-52 is the long rifle of the air age.” As Wired observed in 2016, “recent crew members have been sons and grandsons of previous-generation B-52 crew members.” If the Air Force gets its way, a few more generations will be able to make the same boast. In an interview with Task & Purpose, Eric Single, acquisition chief of the Air Force Global Strike Division, said the Pentagon intends to keep the B-52 in service through 2050 — at least. As of this year, 76 of the 742 B-52 models produced between 1954 and 1963 remain in service, most of them culled from the late-model 102 B-52H bombers that rolled off the assembly line after 1961 and flew missions out of Barksdale Air Force Base and Minot Air Force Base. And with good reason: According to Single, the B-52 was intended from the outset for both high and low altitude bombing operations, the airframe, power plants and engines designed for maximum durability. A B-52 takes off in support of Giant Lance. US Air Force Photo “Global Strike Command intends to keep [the B-52] flyable and viable through that date, even as we deliver on the new B-2s in the mid-[20]20s,” Single said. “It has a structural service life that’s good well beyond 2050.” While most bombers are “very heavily engineered,” Single told Task & Purpose, the aircraft’s longevity is thanks to “both over and under-engineering,” as an Air Force Global Strike Command representative told Wired in 2016: A relatively low empty weight, low drag, expansive wingspan, and the specially engineered airframe mean maximum adaptability. The B-52 may be a big, ugly fat fucker, but it’s the most versatile airframe in the Air Force fleet, well suited for successive upgrades throughout its life. “It was meant to withstand the [buffeting] of nuclear explosion,” Air Force Magazine editorial director John Tirpak told NPR in 2014. “There have been other attempts to replace it with other bombers, and through the years a lot of those bomber programs got canceled. It has a very long range, and it can be used for all kinds of missions, and it’s just been a very rugged, adaptable design for a long time.” Despite frequent updates — 17 B-52s go through a tip-to-tail refurbishment and maintenance annually, and 30 aircraft have had their nuclear weapons systems removed in recent years, as part of the New START treaty — the Pentagon’s fleet is certainly showing some wear and tear after more than 60 years of service. But in 2010, the Air Force announced $11.9 billion umbrella contract with Boeing for a decade of support services, including a far-ranging modernization plan. While the Air Force Global Strike Command directorate of logistics has been engaged in modernization efforts for the legendary bomber since the command initiated its B-52 Avionics Midlife Improvement Program in 2004, the Boeing package is both comprehensive and impressive. The command is giving the historic bomber not just new ears and eyes, but new teeth. Starting in 2005, Air Force Global Strike Command initiated the Combat Network Communications Technology (CONECT) program, a $40 million fleet-wide modernization of the B-52’s tactical datalink and voice communications capabilities, along with improved threat and situational awareness — the bomber’s first avionics upgrade since the 1960s. The modern integrated communications and mission management systems don’t just give B-52s the ability to rapidly retarget weapons in flight, it brings the aircraft’s avionics into the late 20th century, finally. Until 2014, when the first B-52s upgraded with CONECT officially returned to service, this backbone of America’s Cold War strategy relied on fuzzy green screens powered by cathode-ray tubes, like your grandmom’s old television. “Even the flight controls—the yokes in the cockpit, the seats, the control surfaces on the wings and tail assembly, the cable linkages between them—are largely the same as they were when they were built in 1960 and 1961,” observed Wired. It’s hard to overstate how significant this upgrade is. “I was an operational bomber pilot for my whole career,” Single said. “I flew both the B-52 and the B-2, and it’s a night-and-day difference between initial capabilities of the two aircraft.” Single was commander of the 393rd Bomb Squadron at Whiteman on the night the then-controversial stealth B-2 first saw combat during 1999’s Operation Allied Force in Yugoslavia. The B-52 isn’t just behind when it comes to internal systems architecture. Single says the bomber remains the only aircraft in the Pentagon’s inventory without LINK 16 , a tactical data link that connects with other aircraft and strike packages and funnels targeting data and new intelligence through the bomber’s command and control platforms, providing real-time situational awareness. But the most exciting part of the B-52 modernization program is, naturally, on the weapons side. The DoD’s plan includes $163 million for a 1760 internal weapons bay upgrade, or IWBU, to convert the bomber’s carrying capacity. While the B-52 has been raining the advanced GPS-guided bombs that grew out of the Gulf War for more than 15 years, the upgrade will enable them to carry more “smart” bombs than ever in the internal space usually reserved for conventional “dumb” munitions. Chart showing the conventional munitions currently in development for the B-52. DOD The internal weapons bay upgrade focuses on the J-series munitions that are a staple of Air Force ordnance, and consists of eight Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAM) and assorted variants, including the laser-guided variety, on a rotary launcher; eight Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missiles (JASSM), including variants designed for extended range; and eight Miniature Air Launched Decoys used to confuse and disrupt enemy radar. “The B-52 used to carry JDAM on the wing pylons, but now we can carry far more internally and get GPS data directly from the bomber itself,” Single says. “That’s huge. Right now, the B-52 carries the largest range of munitions of any platform out there. This just allows you to carry more.” The key to the upgrade is the Conventional Rotary Launcher, which boasts “multiple types of munitions, which will allow mission planners and weaponeers to pick the perfect cocktail of weaponry for a given mission or target set,” Tyler Rogoway reported in 2015. “For instance, a B-52H assigned to close air support duties may have its CRL loaded a third full of 500lb laser JDAMs, a third full of large 1,000 JDAMs and the rest filled with deadly CBU-105 Sensor Fused Weapons .” Additionally, the B-52’s expansive 185-foot wingspan will receive modifications to house additional JDAM and JASSM weapons packages.Overall, the upgrade will increase the B-52’s carriage capacity by some 66%, Single says. The weapons upgrades, divided into two tiers, are expected to finish by 2022.   Chart showing the timeline for the internal weapons bay upgrade’s (IWBUY) expanded smart munitions capability as part of Air Force Global Strike Command’s B-52 modernization program DOD The weapons’ upgrades will make their way into the fleet sooner than you think. A B-52 dropped a JDAM precision-guided bomb from an internal weapons bay for the first time in July 2016 and JASSMs the next month . But while the CONECT, IBWU, and LINK 16 upgrades have clear roadmaps ahead for development and adoption, the B-52 faces another major update on the horizon: the possible replacement of its legendary engines. For the last two years, Air Force Global Strike Command has been actively evaluating potential replacements for the B-52’s eight Pratt & Whitney TF33 turbofan engines, according to Defense News. GE, Rolls-Royce, and Pratt were vying for the contracts as recently as March. “I think this year will be the point of some decisions on how or if the [engine] program would go forward,” Scot Oathout, Boeing’s director of bomber programs, told Defense News in February. “We’re estimating that [each substitute engine is] roughly at least 30% more efficient on the fuel, which gives us huge operational benefits.” (The Air Force loves to brag that “two B-52s, in two hours, can monitor 140,000 square miles of ocean surface.”) The engine upgrades are still an over-the-horizon project, likely hamstrung by design and procurement constraints, but the weapons and data updates can’t come soon enough. In April 2016, a B-52H Stratofortress out of Barksdale Air Force Base landed Al Udeid Air Base, Qatar, to take part in combat operations as part of Operation Inherent Resolve, the first deployment of a B-52 in U.S. Central Command’s area of responsibility since Desert Storm in 1991. With more than 9,000 airstrikes (and more than 65,000 bombs) dropped on jihadi targets between mid-2014 and the end of 2016, according to U.S. Central Command, the B-52 may just be the arsenal plane the multinational coalition needs to bring the pain to ISIS. “We still rely heavily on it,” Single says. “B-52s are heavily in the fight, every day, and they will be for years to come.” Read the original article on Task & Purpose.

Last week, the final 2017 federal budget allotted $1.1 billion for 14 new Super Hornet fighter jets. While it wasn't the 24 fighter jets at $2.3 billion the president had proposed in his supplemental budget proposal, it marked a win nonetheless: the original Defense Department budget proposal, released early last year, had requested none. "We always thought that the Navy buying additional Super Hornets made sense because they need airplanes to last into the 2040s," said Dan Gillian, head of Boeing's F/A-18 and EA-18 programs. Of course Boeing would think that — and it may have made sense. Still, until recently, the F-18 program had been viewed by many to be a production line on life support, as newer planes including Lockheed Martin's F-35 Joint Strike Fighter roll off assembly lines and into future U.S. carrier air wings. Now, "St. Louis and the fighter business stays on for the next round of programs," said Richard Aboulafia, vice president of analysis at Virginia-based industry consultancy Teal Group. "It didn't look like that would be the case a year ago. Super Hornet orders had been expected to be down by end of decade." Source: US Navy An F/A-18E Super Hornet assigned to the Stingers of Strike Fighter Attack Squadron (VFA) 113 takes off from the flight deck of the aircraft carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt. Boeing's St. Louis, Missouri-based F-18 assembly line complex is currently turning out EA-18G Growlers, the jamming planes outfitted from Super Hornets, for the fiscal 2015 budget year. That year the Navy only ordered Growlers. The following year's budget included five Super Hornets, but the 2017 budget that just passed through Congress is the one that will prove to be an inflection point. "Today we're producing two shipsets per month — Super Hornets and Growlers — in this factory," said Gillian, clad in safety goggles as he walks the plant floor, past stations stocked with workers and plane parts. "As we think about the U.S. Navy's demands for additional airplanes to address the Super Hornet shortfall, as we think about their international demands, we can see that going up to 3 or 4 per month sometime in the early 20s," he said. Boeing anticipates the U.S. Navy will purchase at least another 100 F/A-18s in the five budget cycles beginning with 2018, ensuring its place on aircraft carriers through the next two decades. The long game, however, isn't the plane it's gearing up to manufacture for its 2016 and 2017 orders. Rather, it's the adoption of a new version called "Block III," which Boeing hopes the Navy will opt for before the decade is out. Block III has a longer life cycle, and more advanced avionics that would better complement the F-35C, EA-18G Growler, and other planes comprising the air wing. The aircraft would act as a smart "node" on the naval fighter "network," Gillian said. Block III is based off of the Advanced Super Hornet the company first unveiled in 2013, though today's version focuses less on stealth and more on capability. The general idea: a stealthy F-35 could conduct short-range reconnaissance and transmit that data back to the Super Hornet, which loaded with weapons, could pack the needed punch from farther away. It's this plane that Trump likely had in mind when he asked Boeing to price a "comparable" plane to the fifth generation, stealthy F-35 — a move that caused industry experts to balk but also spurred a Pentagon review of the two fighters' operational capabilities. show chapters Replacing the Navy's planes    Thursday, 4 May 2017 | 10:55 AM ET | 01:25 Still Gillian is quick to stress that Boeing has been engaged in F/A-18 discussions with the Navy for years now, amid inventory shortages. Earlier this year, Navy officials disclosed that two out of every three F-18 fighter planes in its fleet are out of commission on any given day, awaiting repairs. They've been flown hard in a post-9-11 world, which coupled with maintenance backlogs tied to budget cuts, has resulted in a serious maintenance bottleneck for all planes. That coupled with delays for the naval variant of the F-35, which is now expected to be operational in 2018, and the Navy faces a fighter jet shortfall. This is the reason, analysts point out, the service has been pursuing more Super Hornet purchases as it pairs back F-35C orders — even before Trump entered the Oval Office. Aboulafia said over the past five years, the Navy has requested about five times as many Super Hornets as F-35Cs. Boeing has also developed a service life modification program to extend flight hours from 6,000 up to 9,000 for the more than 560 planes the Navy already operates, as the oldest Super Hornets begin to hit that max threshold in 2018. Source: US Navy An F/A-18E Super Hornet from the "Kestrels" of Strike Fighter Squadron (VFA) 137 launches from the Nimitz-class aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson (CVN 70) during flight operations in the western Pacific Ocean. Cost and timing will likely continue to dictate where future defense dollars go. "The F/A-18 is the legacy fighter and the F-35 is the new fighter. The new fighter is going to have some improvements over the legacy fighter. It's going to be stealthier… and have a longer range. But those factors come at a price and I think President Trump has made it very clear that he's looking for the lowest price possible," said John Eade, president and senior analyst at New York-based Argus Research. The Super Hornet currently costs between $70 million and $75 million, according to Boeing. An advanced version will add $3 million to that price tag. By comparison, the naval variant of the F-35 is $121 million, according to the most recent government contract. Boeing is pouncing on that cost component. In a one-page white paper obtained by Defense One, the company makes the argument for the Defense Department to buy more of its new advanced F/A-18s and fewer F-35Cs, suggesting the move would save tens of billions of dollars over 20 years.

During flight testing at Nellis Air Force Base, Nev., Talon HATE pods on two F-15C aircraft enabled test pilots to share information through the military’s Link 16, Common Data Link and Wideband Global SATCOM satellites. The tests also validated intra-flight datalink network capabilities used by F-22 aircraft. Pilots using the system can transmit information quickly between the F-15C and other Air Force aircraft and weapon systems, enabling efficient information sharing in real time. “We’ve completed developmental flight test,” said Lt. Col. Christopher Bradley, Air Force Talon HATE manager. “We look forward to fielding this system, not only to immediately provide aircrews with actionable information faster and at a higher quality, but also to help the Air Force learn important lessons for the employment of tactical gateway systems in the future.” “This aerial network is a giant leap forward in tactical fighter capability with real-time connectivity and expanded information sharing,” said Paul Geery, vice president, Phantom Works Mission Solutions and Boeing’s Talon HATE program manager. “We are now demonstrating secure datalink connections between F-15Cs and F-22s in a way that integrates information for the pilot into a common operating picture.” Boeing will conduct additional tests later this year with advanced sensors, which will offer improved aircraft targeting capabilities.

Boeing disclosed in March that it would locate the headquarters for its new global services division in the $3 billion Legacy West development on the Dallas North Tollway at State Highway 121. Plano's city council is set to approve a cash grant of up to $200,000 to Boeing for the new operation. Driving forces: Toyota's road to the future merged well with Plano's corporate path To get the funding, Boeing will have to rent 15,000 square feet of office space and locate 50 employees in Legacy West. The aerospace giant will join Toyota, JPMorgan Chase, Liberty Mutual Insurance and FedEx with offices in the 240-acre development. The new division will provide training, supply chain management, aircraft modernization and data optimization for its customers. The Chicago-based aircraft maker plans to have the new division up and running with a few dozen senior management officials by later this year. Landing the aerospace firm's division headquarters is another big win for Legacy West, which started construction just over two years ago and will be mostly finished by the end of this year. What Boeing taught D-FW 16 years ago helped land the jet giant this time Boeing will have its office in the same building just North of Legacy Drive where Toyota is housing its high-tech Toyota Connected division headquarters. To get the full economic grant from Plano, Boeing wil have to have its office fully staffed by the end of 2018. Boeing said it will invest more than $2 million in improvements in the new office.

2017 P-8A Poseidon. Gripen D. F-35 Lightning II. Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missile. April's top stories: Boeing wins $2.2bn contract, Israel commissions David's Sling Boeing secured a $2.2bn contract to modernise maritime patrol capabilities of P-8A Poseidon aircraft worldwide, Israel commissioned David's Sling missile defence system. Airforce-technology.com wraps-up the key headlines from April 2017. Boeing wins $2.2bn contract to modernise 17 P-8A Poseidon aircraft Boeing secured a $2.2bn contract to modernise maritime patrol capabilities of P-8A Poseidon aircraft worldwide. The contract covers modernisation of at least 17 P-8A Poseidon aircraft for the US, Australia, and the UK. Boeing's military aircraft mobility, surveillance, and engagement division and P-8 programme manager Jamie Burgess said: “The P-8A is a textbook example of Boeing’s commercial derivative expertise. “Every day our customers get to fly incredible aircraft that perform exceptionally well and are built by the best of Boeing.” Israel commissions David's Sling missile defence system Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reportedly announced the commissioning of the new long-range, anti-missile David's Sling Weapon System (DSWS), which is intended to safeguard the country from threats posed by hostile nations. The US and Israel have jointly developed the system to intercept largecalibre rockets, short-range ballistic missiles and other developing threats. Netanyahu was quoted by The Times of Israel as saying: “We are completely committed to the security of Israeli civilians. “Within the framework of that commitment we are systematically working to strengthen Israel’s strike capabilities against its enemies and, in the same way, we are systematically working to strengthen our ability to defend ourselves against our enemies.” Saab carries out first test flight of biofuel-powered Gripen aircraft Saab conducted a series of test flights of its JAS 39 Gripen powered solely by biofuel made from rapeseed oil. The company said the flights marked the first time a single-engine fighter had flown powered by 100% biofuel and was part of a wider initiative that aims to reduce the environmental impact of aviation. Saab used a dual seat Gripen D for the first biofuel demonstration flight, which was conducted at its facility in Linköping, Sweden. US missile strikes against Syria increase tensions with Russia Tensions rose between Russia and America following the US missile strikes on an air base in Syria in response to the Syrian Government's chemical weapons attack in Khan Sheikhoun. The strikes against Shayrat Airfield in Homs Governorate were ordered by US President Donald Trump. Prior to launching the strikes, Trump said: “Tonight, I ordered a targeted military strike on the airfield in Syria from where the chemical attack was launched. “It is in this vital national security interest of the US to prevent and deter the spread and use of deadly chemical weapons. There can be no dispute that Syria used banned chemical weapons, violated its obligations under the Chemical Weapons Convention and ignored the urging of the UN Security Council.” Norway begins testing drag parachute brake system for F-35 Lightning II Norway continued testing its drag parachute brake screen to ensure safe landing of the F-35 Lightning II joint strike fighter aircraft in harsh weather. Brake chute testing is being carried out in two phases using AF-2 test aircraft specially developed for this purpose. Phase I of the testing at Edwards Air Force Base, California, involves evaluating how F-35 behaves in the air with a fitted drag chute and how the chute acts on dry and wet runways. Rafale completes final guided firing of Meteor long-range air-to-air missile The French Defence Procurement Agency (DGA) completed the final guided firing of the Meteor long-range air-to-air missile from a Rafale omnirole combat aircraft. The integration flight test involved firing of the Meteor missile at an air target and was supported by Dassault Aviation, MBDA and Thales. During the test, the Meteor successfully engaged and destroyed a very long-range, high-speed air target named Mirach. USAF test-fires Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missile The US Air Force (USAF) successfully test-fired an unarmed Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) equipped with a single test re-entry vehicle. The launch was conducted from the Vandenberg Air Force Base (AFB), California, by a combined team of Air Force Global Strike Command airmen. The team comprised 90th Missile Wing (MW) at FE Warren AFB, Wyoming, 341st MW at Malmstrom AFB, Montana, and 625th Strategic Operations Squadron at Offutt AFB, Nebraska. Iraq requests $1.6bn sale of pilot training and logistical support from US The US Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) notified Congress of a potential $1.6bn foreign military sale of pilot training, maintenance training and contractor logistical services support to Iraq. Iraq sought to receive pilot and maintenance training and contractor logistical support for up to five years for trainer aircraft such as C-172, C-208, and T-6 The sale covers contractor aircraft modification, repair and spare parts, publications, aircraft ferry, and miscellaneous parts. It also includes training base operation support, base life support, security, construction, and other related elements of programme support. Royal Air Force Typhoons to participate in Nato's enhanced air policing mission The British Royal Air Force's (RAF) Typhoon detachment was deployed to the Mihail Kogalniceanu (MK) airbase near Constanta, Romania, in order to take part in Nato's enhanced air policing mission. To secure Nato's airspace over Romania, four Typhoon FGR4s will operate alongside 150 personnel from the RAF. The latest four-month deployment forms a part of the alliance's assurance measures introduced in 2014 to respond to new security challenges from the east and the south. Italian Air Force receives Eurofighter Typhoon combat aircraft from Leonardo The Italian Air Force received a new Eurofighter Typhoon combat aircraft from Leonardo Aircraft Division. The latest Eurofighter Typhoon is the 500th aircraft produced by the company so far. Leonardo delivered the first and 100th Eurofighter to the British Royal Air Force in 2003 and 2006 respectively.

In April 1942 Boeing opened a factory in Renton, and over the past 75 years it has produced some of the greatest advancements in aviation including the most technologically advanced airplane of World War II, the world’s first tankers, the world’s first successful commercial jet and one of the most advanced production systems in the world. Renton was originally selected by the U.S. Navy as the assembly site for the Boeing PB2B Sea Ranger, a long range flying boat patrol bomber, and ground was broken for the new plant on the shores of Lake Washington in September 1941. As World War II progressed, the U.S. Navy began to rely more on land based bombers rather than flying boats, resulting in the cancelation of the Sea Ranger program. Fortunately, this was not the end for the Renton plant. While the Navy was looking for land based bombers, the U.S. Army Air Force was looking for a site to build the most technologically advanced airplane of the war — the Boeing B-29 Super-fortress bomber. The Army constructed an airfield next to the plant and on December 30, 1943, a B-29 called the “Renton Girl” became the first of thousands of Boeing planes to make their first flight from the airfield. The production system devised to assemble the B-29 was one of the most modern in the world, making it possible for Boeing workers in Renton to achieve an amazing production record of 160 B-29s during July 1945. After the war the plant reverted to government use, but Boeing returned in 1949 to build the C-97 Stratofreighter and later the KC-97 — the world’s first production aerial refueling tanker. Following the KC-97 was one of the most important airplanes in aviation history. Given the Boeing model number 367-80, it would go down in history as the “Dash 80” — the prototype for the 707. The Dash 80 rolled out at Renton on 1954 and was christened by Bertha Boeing, wife of company founder William Boeing who was the guest of honor. The Dash 80 lead to two different airplanes: the Air Force KC-135 Stratotanker, the world’s first jet tanker, and the 707, the world’s first successful commercial jet. Renton produced all 707s and KC-135s. The plant also built all of the 727s that followed — the first of which rolled out fifty years ago this month on November 27, 1962. That same year Boeing purchased the Renton plant from the Air Force. In 1966 to accommodate assembly of the popular 727 and the highly anticipated Supersonic Transport, Boeing built the two high bay assembly buildings which dominate the site today. In 1970, an economic downturn led the company to a number of diversification programs including hydrofoil boats. Renton built six USS Pegasus class Hydrofoil Missileships for the U.S. Navy as well as 24 commercial Jetfoils. The airplane business turned up in the 1980s and Renton launched the 757, which along with the 767 introduced the two-crew “glass cockpit” to commercial aviation. Following in the tradition of the B-29, Renton has been a proving ground for a number of highly effective production innovations, including the moving line and the “Move to the Lake” consolidating the resources of a once sprawling site into the major production buildings, putting engineering and other resources next to the production line. Today Renton is the home of the 737 and the site continues to make history as one of the world’s most productive airplane assembly plants, going to a staggering 47 planes produced a month. While in the midst of making commercial aviation history, Renton is also producing the P-8A Poseidon in the original buildings built by the U.S. Navy in 1941 — after 75 years the historic plant is finally building long range patrol planes for the U.S. Navy.

The secret US Air Force plane that spent over 700 days in space Why has the X-37B has been in low Earth orbit for so long? By Agamoni Ghosh Updated May 8, 2017 10:27 BST The US Air Force's X-37B autonomous experimental space plane, which was orbiting the Earth on a secret missionUS Air Force The US Air Force's Boeing X-37B, often dubbed as a mystery space vehicle, returned to Earth on 7 May, after spending 718 days in low Earth orbit. The Air Force took to Twitter to announce the feat. This was the X-37B programme's fourth successful test, significant as it is the first time the vehicle has both launched and landed at a single home port - the Kennedy Space Center. The US military maintains that the X-37B was sent to space for tests pertaining to the performance of future space missions. However, speculation has been rife about the secret space plane for years now, with many saying it is a weaponised platform used by the US for various activities such as spying and destroying other satellites. It is even said to be capable of releasing weapons at targeted areas on Earth. What is the Boeing X-37B? Alternatively known as the Orbital Test Vehicle (OTV), the X-37B is a reusable unmanned spacecraft that is launched into space by a carrier rocket. It then re-enters the Earth's atmosphere as a spaceplane. The X-37 programme was started by Nasa in 1999, which initially planned to construct two space vehicles; an Approach and Landing Test Vehicle (ALTV), and an Orbital Vehicle. In 2004 the project was transferred to the US military, specifically its research wing, Darpa (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency), famous for running an array of classified projects. Although Nasa's objective to build an Orbital Vehicle did not materialise, it nevertheless served as the base for what is the X-37B now. The purpose of the X-37B remains a mystery. Boeing X-37B technical specifications The 4,990kg spaceplane measures 8.92m long, with a wingspan of 4.55m. It has a small payload bay of 2.1 x 1.2m, and carries no crew. It is powered by gallium arsenide solar cells with lithium-ion batteries. It has only one manoeuvring engine that burns hydrazine and nitrogen tetroxide. Why was the Boeing X-37B sent to space? After Darpa finished the ALTV part of the programme, the first flight drop test was conducted on 7 April, 2006, at Edwards Air Force Base, California. The actual space orbital was launched four years later on 22 April 2010 using an Atlas V rocket. When asked about the purpose of the mission, neither Nasa nor the US military have given clear answers, simply repeating the line that it is for future space research. An X-37B fact sheet provided by the Air Force defines the primary objectives of the X-37B as twofold: reusable spacecraft technologies advancement for America's future in space; and operating experiments which can be returned to and examined on Earth. The X-37B programme is currently run by the Air Force's Rapid Capabilities Office, and to date two different X-37B vehicles have completed a total of four missions, known as OTV-1, OTV-2, OTV-3 and OTV-4. Rumours and speculation about the mission's real purpose The secrecy surrounding the mission resulted in rumour and speculation. Shortly after its maiden orbital launch in 2010, SpaceDaily wrote a lengthy feature suggesting the X-37B could be a "Space Bomber" designed to destroy enemy satellites, or act as a "launch vehicle" that could deliver bombs or missiles to any part of the planet. Some experts dismissed these possibilities, saying the plane is too small and not manoeuvrable enough for such work. Other conspiracy theorists claimed that while it may not be able to destroy satellites, it could be deploying its own. Others opined that it is used for spying on countires such as China and North Korea. The latest theories suggest the vessel is testing out an experimental propulsion system. 1 of 3 Illustration and diagram of the U.S. Air Force X-37B reusable space plane which is expected to land in the coming days after a secret 15-month space missionReuters Illustration and diagram of the U.S. Air Force X-37B reusable space plane which is expected to land in the coming days after a secret 15-month space missionReuters The X-37B Orbital Test Vehicle waits in the encapsulation cell of the Evolved Expendable Launch vehicle at the Astrotech facility in Titusville, Florida in this April 5, 2010 handout photo provided by the U.S. Air Force.

The cost of the program is also classified. Don't miss: Is Banksy's Latest Work Too 'Boring?' Gallerist Evaluates the Street Artist's Brexit Mural in Dover The Secure World Foundation, a nonprofit group promoting the peaceful exploration of space, says the secrecy surrounding the X-37B suggests the presence of intelligence-related hardware being tested or evaluated aboard the craft. The vehicles are 29 feet long and have a wingspan of 15 feet, making them about one quarter of the size of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s now-retired space shuttles. The X-37B, also known as Orbital Test Vehicle, or OTV, first flew in April 2010 and returned after eight months. A second mission launched in March 2011 and lasted 15 months, while a third took flight in December 2012 and returned after 22 months. Most popular: Pension Savers Need Straight Advice.

The new pod—which can connect via Link 16, Common Data Link and Wideband Global SATCOM satellites—allows the fourth-generation jets to plug into the fifth-generation Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor air superiority fighter and to ground stations using the fifth-generation jets’ own network. While the Raptor has its own proprietary Intra-Flight Data Link (IFDL), the F-22 does not have the ability to transmit on the standard Link-16 network—though it can receive data. The Talon HATE allows the F-15 to connect with the Raptor’s IFDL network. “This aerial network is a giant leap forward in tactical fighter capability with real-time connectivity and expanded information sharing,” said Paul Geery, vice president of Boeing’s Phantom Works Mission Solutions and the company’s Talon HATE program manager. “We are now demonstrating secure datalink connections between F-15Cs and F-22s in a way that integrates information for the pilot into a common operating picture.” The key to the Talon HATE system is that it can share information between the F-22, F-15C and other platforms in real time. Right now, F-22 and F-15C pilots—who are the Air Force’s air superiority team—are forced to share data via voice communication over encrypted radio. The process, while effective, is inefficient. Real time machine-to-machine data transfers would allow the Air Force’s two key air dominance platforms to seamlessly share their data—and perhaps more importantly—share targeting information. Thus, a F-15C could use its AIM-120 AMRAAMs to engage a target that is being spotted far ahead by a stealthy F-22—without forcing the Raptor to use its expend its limited payload of missiles. According to the Air Force, the most recent Talon HATE tests at Nellis Air Force Base in Nevada showed that the system could handle multiple aircraft on the network in realistic conditions. “We’ve completed developmental flight test,” Lt. Col. Christopher Bradley, Air Force’s Talon HATE manager said. “We look forward to fielding this system, not only to immediately provide aircrews with actionable information faster and at a higher quality, but also to help the Air Force learn important lessons for the employment of tactical gateway systems in the future.” Indeed, the full potential of the Talon HATE system has yet to be fully realized. Only when frontline combat air forces squadrons learn how to use the system will the service realize the Talon HATE’s true potential. Those frontline units will develop new tactics and procedures in ways the developers never imagined possible. But already, the Talon HATE shows great promise.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 9 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman How Harmful Is the Air Quality on Planes? Riverdale, NJ, 05/08/2017 /SubmitPressRelease123/ Although we tend to focus a lot on the outdoor pollution that is plaguing many major cities throughout the world, indoor air quality is also a big problem, and that includes the air you breathe when you fly on an airplane. Air quality on planes can affect your health in ways that you may not even realize. “The problem with air quality on planes is that you are really talking about incubating pollutants that are generated inside the cabin,” stated Kevin Wood, Camfil USA Vice President Sales & Marketing. “And without an air filtration system, passengers can inhale or swallow these pollutants, which are capable of worsening respiratory problems such as asthma. So, it’s important for airline passengers to understand what determines the quality of air inside an airplane.” According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) article, potential cabin air hazards include: (1) Carbon monoxide Carbon dioxide Pesticides Communicable diseases from passengers who are ill Pressurization changes that affect cabin air circulation And according to a piece published on the Association of Flight Attendants website, (2) there are other sources of airplane cabin pollution, including ‘bio effluents,” which enter the air when you exhale: “….your breath contains all kinds of gases and vapors, such as carbon dioxide, ethanol and aldehydes…[and] water droplets in your breath or in a sneeze or cough can transport bacteria or viruses into the air. Meanwhile, you are busy shedding skin particles that can also serve to transport bacteria and viruses, and your digestive system is busy generating gases.” And here’s something you probably didn’t know. Although there are engineering standards that recommend levels of air filtration for airplanes there is no federal requirement for airplanes to install air filters, so that means that the air in many cabins may not be filtered or cleaned in any way, exposing you to harmful particulates. Toxic Fumes Becoming an Issue The issue of air quality on planes became a big issue recently when four flight attendants filed a lawsuit against Boeing, accusing the aircraft giant of negligence regarding the presence of toxic fumes inside an aircraft’s cabin. Per an article in USA Today, (3) the four flight attendants were all working an Alaska Airlines flight that was forced to make an emergency landing after toxic fumes escaped into the cabin. When the plane landed, all four flight attendants were rushed to a hospital, and two of them lost consciousness while the plane was still in flight. The four filed suit against Boeing – a supplier of planes for Alaska Airlines – for “exposing them and the plane’s passengers to toxic fumes that seep into the plane’s ventilation system.” As the article explained, the majority of airplanes receive ventilation through outside air that circulates through the aircraft’s engines into the cabin. This is known as the “bleed air system,” and is used in a wide variety of aircraft to generate clean air inside a cabin. But if something goes awry, such as a broken seal inside an engine, then oil can contaminate the air that flows into the cabin. The flight attendant’s lawsuit accuses Boeing of being aware of the issue since the 1950s, but not doing anything to fix the problem. What’s more concerning, however, is that the bleed air system can create contaminated air in a cabin without black smoke blowing into the cabin, which means passengers can easily inhale toxic air and not be aware of it. That’s the reason that part of the lawsuit asked for Boeing to install air quality sensors to alert pilots that bad air is circulating throughout the cabin. And according to an article in Gizmodo, (4) bad air quality on planes can cause symptoms such as “…irritation to the eyes, nose and throat, headaches, light-headedness and dizziness, fatigue, weakness, generally feeling unwell, confusion and difficulties in concentration.” The challenge for health care experts trying to make the case that air quality on planes can be hazardous to public health, is that there are not many passengers who report these types of symptoms to their doctors, so there is very little anecdotal evidence. In most cases, flight attendants are the ones who report their symptoms, and unless they file lawsuits, it is doubtful that the quality of air inside plane cabins will be as publicized as it needs to be to help protect passengers. Providing Solutions Energy efficient air filtration solutions  can help eliminate a significant amount of pollutants from airplane cabins. Most airliners are designed with HEPA filters to clean the air recirculated within the airplanes. Sometimes the filters are removed by the air carriers because moving air through the filters uses energy which costs the airlines additional fuel dollars. Most apply the filters properly for the protection of their customers and employees. At Camfil, we have also developed products specifically designed to reduce the pollution generated in the airports. Our goal is to protect people in the airports and after they step into the airliner cabin.

ULA is a partnership between Lockheed Martin Corp and Boeing. What did it do in space? The X-37B conducted unspecified experiments for more than 700 days while in orbit. It was the fourth and lengthiest mission so far for the secretive program, which is managed by the Air Force Rapid Capabilities Office. Are there plans for more missions? Yes. The Air force intends to launch the fifth X-37B mission from Cape Canaveral later this year. In tweets Ce matin, le #x37b s'est posé en Floride après 718 jours dans l'espace à faire… on ne sait quoi.

The project will use advanced sensing equipment mounted on a research aircraft operated by the NRC to measure the impact of biofuel blends on contrail formation by aircraft on five biofuel flights operated by Air Canada between Montreal and Toronto. During these flights the National Research Council of Canada will trail the Air Canada aircraft with a modified T-33 research jet to sample and test the contrail biofuel emissions. The sustainable biofuel is produced by AltAir Fuels from used cooking oil and supplied by SkyNRG. "The National Research Council of Canada is proud to collaborate with our Canadian partners on this important research that will further reveal the viability of biofuels. By contributing our unique T-33 research aircraft specializing in contrail data collection and our expertise in emissions analysis, we hope to provide key information toward biofuel inclusion in all future flights," said Jerzy Komorowski, General Manager of NRC's Aerospace portfolio. A reduction in the thickness and coverage of contrails produced by the jet engines of aircraft could reduce aviation's impact on the environment, an important beneficial effect of sustainable biofuel usage in aviation. This project involves six stakeholder organizations, with primary funding from the Green Aviation Research and Development Network (GARDN), a non-profit organization funded by the Business-Led Network of Centres of Excellence of the Government of Canada and the Canadian aerospace industry. The project has further financial support from the NRC and the enabling support of Air Canada ground and flight operations. In addition to Air Canada, other CAAFCER partners include (alphabetical order) Boeing, National Research Council Canada (NRC), SkyNRG, University of Alberta, and Waterfall.  Sheila Remes, vice president of strategy at Boeing Commercial Airplanes, said, "We significantly improve airplane fuel efficiency through constant technology and operational improvements. But additional efforts are required to achieve aviation's ambitious carbon-reduction targets. Sustainable aviation fuels have the single greatest potential to reach those goals. Boeing is committed to supporting projects like this around the world to advance aviation's knowledge and growing use of biofuel." Air Canada And The Environment To reduce its emissions Air Canada has adopted a four-pillar strategy that includes: the use of new technology, improved operations, infrastructure changes and the use of economic instruments. One example is Air Canada's participation as an airline partner in Canada's Biojet Supply Chain Initiative (CBSCI). It is a three-year collaborative project begun in 2015 with 14 stakeholder organizations to introduce 400,000 litres of sustainable aviation biofuel (biojet) into the shared fuel system at Montreal airport. The CBSCI project is a first in Canada and is aimed at creating a sustainable Canadian supply chain of biojet using renewable feedstocks. In 2012 Air Canada operated two biofuel flights one between Toronto and Mexico City as part of a series of commercial biofuel flights that took the secretary general of ICAO to the United Nations conference on Sustainable Development held in Rio de Janeiro; the second flight transported a number of Olympic athletes and officials on their way to the London 2012 Olympic Games. Air Canada is also investing in new aircraft. In 2016 the airline continued taking delivery of the Boeing 787 Dreamliner (pictured above). Initial results show these aircraft are delivering approximately 20% improvement in efficiency over the aircraft they replaced. Air Canada plans to introduce 37 of these new aircraft in the coming years.  In addition, later this year, the airline will acquire up to 79 new Boeing 737 Max aircraft, expected to yield a 14% decrease in fuel use over the most current narrow-body aircraft. One of Air Canada's most notable recent accomplishment is a 40% improvement in average fuel efficiency between 1990 and 2016. Air Canada is taking further steps to reduce its carbon footprint including: - Through the National Airlines Council of Canada, supporting the Canadian government in Canada's Action Plan to Reduce GHG Emissions from Aviation; - Endorsing targets set by the International Air Transport Association (IATA), which include cutting CO2 emissions 50 percent by 2050 relative to 2005 levels; and, - Building on its strong record of environmental legislative and regulatory compliance, Air Canada has established an Environmental Management System based on ISO 14001 to address long-term environmental issues and challenges. Following publication in September 2015 of an updated ISO 14001 standard, Air Canada commenced a review of its current EMS and will continue working to bring it into alignment with the new standard.

(Photo via US Air Force) - + CAPE CANAVERAL, FLORIDA - The US military's experimental X-37B space plane landed on Sunday at Nasa's Kennedy Space Center in Florida, completing a classified mission that lasted nearly two years, the Air Force said. The Air Force tweeted Monday that the reusable X-37B Orbital Test Vehicle had landed safely, completing its fourth classified mission. The #AirForce #X37B #OTV4 has returned from orbit and has landed safely @NASAKennedy. Stay tuned for more info. — U.S. Air Force (@usairforce) May 7, 2017 Air Force officials have called the X-37B program, which is managed by the Air Force Rapid Capabilities Office, "the newest and most advanced re-entry spacecraft." The #X37B #OTV4 is the newest and most advanced re-entry spacecraft. Find out more about today's landing here: https://t.co/GUGgOMQiYg pic.twitter.com/HfHHVnWhYc — U.S. Air Force (@usairforce) May 7, 2017 The unmanned X-37B, which resembles a miniature space shuttle, touched down at 7.47am (6.47pm Thailand time, 1147 GMT) on a runway formerly used for landings of the now-mothballed space shuttles, the Air Force said in an email. The Boeing-built space plane blasted off in May 2015 from nearby Cape Canaveral Air Force Station aboard an Atlas 5 rocket built by United Launch Alliance, a partnership between Lockheed Martin Corp and Boeing Co. The X-37B, one of two in the Air Force fleet, conducted unspecified experiments for more than 700 days while in orbit. It was the fourth and lengthiest mission so far for the secretive program, managed by the Air Force Rapid Capabilities Office. The orbiters "perform risk reduction, experimentation and concept-of-operations development for reusable space vehicle technologies," the Air Force has said without providing details. The cost of the program is also classified. The Secure World Foundation, a non-profit group promoting the peaceful exploration of space, says the secrecy surrounding the X-37B suggests the presence of intelligence-related hardware being tested or evaluated aboard the craft. The vehicles are 9 metres long and have a wingspan of 5 metres, making them about one quarter of the size of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s now-retired space shuttles. The Air Force intends to launch the fifth X-37B mission from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, located just south of the Kennedy Space Center, later this year. The X-37B, also known as Orbital Test Vehicle, or OTV, first flew in April, 2010, and returned after eight months. A second mission launched in March, 2011, and lasted 15 months, while a third took flight in December, 2012, and returned after 22 months.

The contract includes a wide variety of inspection and engineering projects, including High Flight Hour programs designed to keep aging airframes flying. Work will be conducted in Jacksonville, Fla., and the funds will be obligated based on individual orders during the duration of the program. The work is expected to be completed by December 2017. The F-18 fighter is the primary naval aviation fighter plane used by the Navy and Marine Corps. It can serve in both a naval superiority and ground attack roles. It can launch from both aircraft carriers and land-based airfields, and can carry a wide variety of ordinance. The F-35 is expected to supplement them within a few years.

 Unmanned US Air Force space plane lands after secret, two-year mission Reuters May 8, 2017, 8:59 AM 3,142 facebook linkedin twitter email print The US Air Force's X-37B Orbital Test Vehicle mission 4 at NASA's Kennedy Space Center Shuttle Landing Facility in Cape Canaveral, Florida. Thomson Reuters CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (Reuters) - The U.S. military's experimental X-37B space plane landed on Sunday at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida, completing a classified mission that lasted nearly two years, the Air Force said. The unmanned X-37B, which resembles a miniature space shuttle, touched down at 7:47 a.m. EDT (1147 GMT) on a runway formerly used for landings of the now-mothballed space shuttles, the Air Force said in an email. The Boeing-built space plane blasted off in May 2015 from nearby Cape Canaveral Air Force Station aboard an Atlas 5 rocket built by United Launch Alliance, a partnership between Lockheed Martin Corp and Boeing Co . The X-37B, one of two in the Air Force fleet, conducted unspecified experiments for more than 700 days while in orbit. It was the fourth and lengthiest mission so far for the secretive program, managed by the Air Force Rapid Capabilities Office. The orbiters "perform risk reduction, experimentation and concept-of-operations development for reusable space vehicle technologies," the Air Force has said without providing details. The cost of the program is also classified. The Secure World Foundation, a nonprofit group promoting the peaceful exploration of space, says the secrecy surrounding the X-37B suggests the presence of intelligence-related hardware being tested or evaluated aboard the craft. The vehicles are 29 feet (9 meters) long and have a wingspan of 15 feet, making them about one quarter of the size of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s now-retired space shuttles. The X-37B, also known as Orbital Test Vehicle, or OTV, first flew in April 2010 and returned after eight months. A second mission launched in March 2011 and lasted 15 months, while a third took flight in December 2012 and returned after 22 months. Sunday’s landing was the X-37B's first in Florida. The three previous landings took place at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. The Air Force relocated the program in 2014, taking over two of NASA’s former shuttle-processing hangars. The Air Force intends to launch the fifth X-37B mission from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, located just south of the Kennedy Space Center, later this year.

Load Error This was the X-37B programme's fourth successful test, but is significant as for the first the time, the plane landed at the Kennedy Space Center, taking forward a long-sought programmatic evolution to combine both launch and landing operations at a single home port. This was the X-37B programme's fourth successful test, but is significant as for the first the time, the plane landed at the Kennedy Space Center, taking forward a long-sought programmatic evolution to combine both launch and landing operations at a single home port. The military took to Twitter to announce the feat and maintained that the X-37B was sent to space for test pertaining to performance of future space missions. However, speculation has been rife about the secret space plane for years now, with many saying it is a weaponised space tool put by the US in orbital Earth for various activities like spying, destroying other satellites. It is even said to be capable of releasing weapons at targeted areas on Earth. IBTimes UK brings you all that you need to know about this spaceplane and its mission. What is the Boeing X-37B? Alternatively known as the Orbital Test Vehicle (OTV), the X-37B is a reusable unmanned spacecraft that is booted into space by a launch vehicle and then re-enters the Earth's atmosphere as a spaceplane. Technical Specifications: The 4,990kg spaceplane measures 8.8 metres long and has a small cargo bay same as the size of a pickup truck bed. It is powered by gallium arsenide solar cells with lithium-ion batteries and its wingspan measures approximately 4.5 metres. It has only one manoeuvring engine that burns hydrazine and nitrogen tetroxide. The X-37 programme was started by Nasa in 1999 which initially planned to construct two space vehicles: an Approach and Landing Test Vehicle (ALTV) and an Orbital Vehicle. However, in 2004 the project was transferred to the US military, specifically its research wing, Darpa (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency), famously known for running an array of classified projects. Although Nasa's objective to build an Orbital Vehicle did not materialise, it nevertheless served as the base for what is the X-37B now. Why was it sent to space? After Darpa finished the ALTV part of the programme, the first flight drop test was conducted on 7 April, 2006, at Edwards Air Force Base, California. The actual space orbital was launched four years later, on 22 April, 2010 using an Atlas V rocket When quizzed about the purpose of the mission, neither Nasa nor the military have given clear answers except for harping on the fact that it is for future space research. An X-37B fact sheet provided by the Air Force defines the primary objectives of the X-37B as twofold: reusable spacecraft technologies advancement for America's future in space and operating experiments which can be returned to, and examined, on Earth. Rumours and speculation about the mission's real purpose The secrecy surrounding the mission, however, resulted in rumours on the US' real intention to put the spaceplane out there. Shortly after its maiden orbital launch in 2010, SpaceDaily wrote a lengthy feature suggesting the X037B could be a "Space Bomber" designed to destroy enemy satellites, or act as a "launch vehicle" that could deliver bombs or missiles to any part of the planet. Some experts, however, dismissed these possibilities saying the plane is too small and not manoeuvrable enough for such work. Some theorists also claimed that while it may not be able to destroy satellites, it may be deploying its own. Some conspiracy theorists have opined it is used for spying on China and other countries like North Korea. Latest theories, however, suggest the vessel is testing out an experimental propulsion system. The X-37B programme is currently run by the Air Force's Rapid Capabilities Office and till date two different X-37B vehicles have completed a total of four missions, known as OTV-1, OTV-2, OTV-3 and OTV-4.

(Photo by Boeing) Embed <iframe src="http://PressTV.com/Default/Embed/520993" width="580" height="326" frameborder="0"></iframe> Download The US military’s mysterious spacecraft has returned to its base, completing a two-year secret mission in Earth’s orbit. The unmanned Boeing X-37B landed at NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida on Sunday, after making a sonic boom that could be heard from miles away. The space plane was launched from the nearby Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in May 2015, aboard an Atlas 5 rocket built by United Launch Alliance (ULA), a partnership between Lockheed Martin Corp and Boeing. This was the spacecraft’s first landing in Florida. All the previous missions had landed in California’s Vandenberg Air Force Base. The orbiter spent 718 days in the space, setting a new on-orbit endurance record. Overall, the two X-37Bs built so far have spent 2,085 days in space. Also known as Orbital Test Vehicle (OTV), the 29-feet-long drone was first launched into space in April 2010 and returned after eight months. It was sent on a second mission in March 2011 and remained in space for 15 months. The spacecraft set on its third mission in December 2012 and returned after 22 months. Brigadier General Wayne Monteith, commander of the 45th Space Wing, thanked his forces for conducting the last mission. “Our team has been preparing for this event for several years, and I am extremely proud to see our hard work and dedication culminate in today's safe and successful landing of the X-37B,” he said in a statement. According to the USAF, the reusable plane “performs risk reduction, experimentation and concept of operations development for reusable space vehicle technologies.” This is while, military analysts say the spacecraft will be ultimately used for spying activities. The Secure World Foundation, a nonprofit promoting the peaceful exploration of space, says the US military is using the platform to test intelligence-related hardware. The USAF is planning to launch the fifth X-37B mission from Cape Canaveral air force station later this year. “The ability to land, refurbish, and launch from the same location further enhances the OTV's ability to rapidly integrate and qualify new space technologies,” said Monteith.

Image: US Air Force A spacecraft unlike any other has returned after a two-year mission, scaring Florida locals with a series of powerful sonic booms. Those living in the surroundings of the Kennedy Space Center in Florida were awoken by a deafening noise yesterday morning (7 May), prompting a flurry of questions on social media. However, just a few minutes after they occurred, the US Air Force confirmed that the sonic booms were the result of one of its most experimental spacecraft breaking the sound barrier on its return to Earth. Three years ago, this same mysterious craft was spotted flying over US skies and was eventually revealed as the Boeing X-37B. The uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV) was originally a NASA concept design dating back to 1999 but, after years of stagnation, it was passed on to the US Air Force, resulting in Boeing producing its first prototype in 2010. Now the military has revealed, unbeknownst to most of us, that the craft has spent the last two years (718 days) orbiting the Earth. It also confirmed its safe arrival on the runway at the Kennedy Space Center. The #X37B #OTV4 is the newest and most advanced re-entry spacecraft. Find out more about today's landing here: https://t.co/GUGgOMQiYg pic.twitter.com/HfHHVnWhYc — U.S. Air Force (@usairforce) May 7, 2017 Advanced but mysterious purpose Marking the first spacecraft touchdown at the runway in six years, the X-37B is one of the most advanced aircraft out there, with an array of advanced computer systems and solar power devices. The US Air Force said that the UAV performs risk reduction, experimentation and concept of operations development for reusable space vehicle technologies. While much of the craft’s activities remain secret, CBS News said that previous X-37B missions have tested all sorts of highly experimental technology, including an engine that produces thrust using electrically charged xenon ions. “Today marks an incredibly exciting day for the 45th Space Wing as we continue to break barriers,” said brigadier general Wayne Monteith. “Our team has been preparing for this event for several years, and I am extremely proud to see our hard work and dedication culminate in today’s safe and successful landing of the X-37B.” Related: spacetech, NASA, US 66 DAYS 4 HOURS 26 MINUTES Get your early bird tickets now!

The unmanned X-37B, which resembles a miniature space shuttle, touched down at 7:47 a.m. on a runway formerly used for landings of the now-mothballed space shuttles, the air force said in an email. The Boeing-built space plane blasted off in May 2015 from nearby Cape Canaveral Air Force Station aboard an Atlas 5 rocket built by United Launch Alliance, a partnership between Lockheed Martin Corp. and Boeing Co. The X-37B, one of two in the air force fleet, conducted unspecified experiments for more than 700 days while in orbit. It was the fourth and lengthiest mission so far for the secretive program, managed by the Air Force Rapid Capabilities Office. The orbiters “perform risk reduction, experimentation and concept-of-operations development for reusable space vehicle technologies,” the air force has said without providing details. The cost of the program is also classified. The Secure World Foundation, a nonprofit group promoting the peaceful exploration of space, says the secrecy surrounding the X-37B suggests the presence of intelligence-related hardware being tested or evaluated aboard the craft. The vehicles are 29 feet (9 meters) long and have a wingspan of 15 feet (about 5 meters), making them about a quarter of the size of NASA’s now-retired space shuttles. The X-37B, also known as Orbital Test Vehicle, or OTV, first flew in April 2010 and returned after eight months. A second mission was launched in March 2011 and lasted 15 months, while a third took flight in December 2012 and returned after 22 months. Sunday’s landing was the X-37B’s first in Florida. The three previous landings took place at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. The air force relocated the program in 2014, taking over two of NASA’s former shuttle-processing hangars. The air force intends to launch the fifth X-37B mission from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, located just south of the Kennedy Space Center, later this year.

[Photo/Xinhua] Over the last few decades, China has made enormous progress in the development of high technology, catching up on the West in many fields in which Western superiority had earlier been established, and competing successfully from an equal basis in many industries which were only launched once China’s reform and opening policy had been established.But aviation has so far lagged behind. Thirty years ago Chinese-built aircraft operated internal flights, as well as a number of second-hand planes bought from the then Soviet Union. But gradually, as China devolved her internal air services to a number of separate airlines, they all wanted to be up with the latest technology and bought in aircraft from Boeing and the European suppliers who were to unite to become Airbus. And this situation was even more acute when it came to international flights: Chinese aircraft technology was little known in the West, and there were a number of safety concerns. So, for some time now China has been dependent on American or European aircraft technology for her domestic and international services. The decision to aim for equal participation in the long-distance aviation market was taken by the State Council in 2007, and great patience and meticulous research was deployed. Although the first C919 was completed by 2015, intensive testing and quality control was demanded before last week’s flight could take place. Anything going wrong might have set China’s program back by decades, and this was successfully avoided. But now the whole world has become confident, through long experience, in using Chinese technology, and so now China has put herself in a position to challenge the existing small group of suppliers of jumbo jets: USA, Europe and Russia. On May 5, the first large Chinese passenger plane, the C919, made its maiden flight from Shanghai, where the manufacturer, Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC), is based. Vice Premier Ma Kai and Shanghai’s Communist Party chief Han Zheng were present to see the plane depart, on a flight which lasted about 80 minutes. There were no passengers aboard, but the aircraft will be fitted to carry about 160. The C919 will compete in the international aviation market at the narrow-body, medium-distance level, with the Airbus A320 and the Boeing 737. The standard range will be just over 4,000 kilometres. It represents a technological partnership with existing players in the industry, including General Electric and France’s Safran – who built the engines – and the U.S. companies Honeywell International Inc. and UTC Aerospace Systems. This demonstrates that China is not afraid to incorporate foreign technological excellence, and also that Western companies welcome Chinese participation in the market. Competition, however, will be no easy affair. It is likely to be some time before the C919 makes a serious impact on the international aviation market. Even in the domestic market, China’s ARJ-21, the first Chinese home-made jet of the 21st century, took eight years from maiden flight to commercial launch. China is clearly planning for the long term here, and will not be daunted if breaking into the market takes a few years. Boeing has been in the business since early in the last century and Airbus for over 40 years. A key element in aircraft construction is establishing an absolutely reliable supply chain, and that will take time, especially in an age of lightning-fast technological developments and requirements. China also comes fresh to the business of selling into a market in which other companies are already well established, and are unlikely to make it easy for a newcomer. There is still plenty of hard work to do, both on the technical and the marketing sides. At the COMAC assembly plant in Shanghai, at the time of the flight, the management hung out banners calling for more hard work, struggle and determination to meet the goals of the company and the Chinese aviation program. This will be a long and steadily developing business. Of course, as many leading Chinese figures have pointed out, China’s need for aircraft, domestic and international, is huge and growing rapidly – and it makes no sense to have to spend billions in foreign exchange sourcing them all from abroad. No less a competitor than Boeing itself has predicted that China will become the world’s foremost aviation market in the next 20 years, needing at least 6,000 new aircraft. And so far foreign and domestic customers, including Air China, have already placed orders for 570 of COMAC’s planes. The absence of a top-quality Chinese long-distance passenger aircraft has been an anomaly in the modern world, and also a great challenge to Chinese technological and innovative capacity. The development of the C919 demonstrates China’s determination to compete at the highest level in this difficult but essential market. Tim Collard is a columnist with China.org.cn.

It prides itself on offering value for money to its customers – from award winning in-flight entertainment to the service of Emirates Multi-national Cabin Crew. Manoj Nair, Country Manager for Ethiopia has worked for Emirates since 2009 and before coming to Ethiopia, he has also been in charge of the portfolio for West Africa. He spoke to Capital about Emirates’ operations in the country and the continent and how they have become so successful. Capital: What is Emirates strategy for the African market? Manoj Nair: I think Emirates has always believed in the economic potential of this continent and we have maintained a very good presence across the African continent our continuous focus is to grow our passenger and cargo operations in this part of the world. One of the things that we are always focused on is to ensure that we give the best value for money to our customers and from a growth perspective, we want to make sure we maintain our presence in this market, increase our capacity as well as increase our frequencies and in places where it suits us upgrade our fleets as well. We feel that it is a region with a lot of potential. Capital: There aren’t a lot of national airlines in Africa, the main one is Ethiopian Airlines, you also have Turkish airlines which has a heavy presence. But you have competitive prices, besides that, what do you offer customers to remain competitive? Nair: We consider ourselves to be a global carrier, and being a global carrier, one of our biggest strengths is our network connectivity. We have connections to more than 150 countries in the world. The other big advantage is our hub, which is Dubai. The reason we say that is because Dubai is not only one of the fastest growing destination in the world but also the most preferred destination for leisure as well as business. It is the most visited country in the world as well so people do have this affinity towards Dubai as a destination which plays to our advantage. We continue to advance our products; we do have a very good fleet, the A380 our customers just love it especially the first and business class passengers because we have an on board lounge service which people just love because it’s a great place to interact with other like-minded business and premium customers. Also with regards to the first class passengers we have a spa shower on board which is also something that is very convenient for people who are going on long flights and when they are about to land they can take a shower and go straight for their meetings and such. Those are the customer experiences that we have enhanced over a period of time and which is our competitive advantage. I think I will also say that for our Ethiopian customers, we do offer all their preferred destinations; we have 12 destinations to the US, 20 destinations to Europe and more than 30 destinations to Asia Pacific, which are destinations which Ethiopian or African customer would like to visit in their travels. We have a very multinational and multi-linguistic crew which speak over 60 languages and a lot of them are Ethiopians as well, so it makes the customer really comfortable when they are on board. Lastly I think the entertainment system is second to none in the world, we have the largest in-seat screen and over 2,200 channels. If you add all these together, we do have a lot of value for money services and that is what keeps us more competitive in this market. Capital: What about regarding a longer term strategy, what should we expect from Emirates in the years to come? Nair: From a long term perspective, we will continue to do what we have been doing all along and that is to make sure that we give the best value for money service, the most important thing is the experience our customers take when they are flying with Emirates and continue to be the first choice of travelers in this market. Capital: What about the challenges you face operating in Africa? Nair: I think from a challenge perspective it’s a very fluid and dynamic market, any market is fluid and dynamic. There are bound to be challenges which are internal and external but the advantage that we have as Emirates is that we are very adaptable. We have a very sole focus on the market, we do understand that the capacity and demand and supply is in context to what influences any market and because of our adaptability we do know how to channel our capacity as well as our flaws in those aspects. Capital: Speaking about challenges, how has the recent ban on items such as laptops to US bound flights affected your operations? Nair: I think Emirates have mitigated the risk or the ban on electronic devices. We have addressed this in two parts; one is where we have the first and business class customers, if they are originating from another point, we have allowed them to carry their electronic items up until Dubai to continue working until the boarding gate. And once they are at the boarding gate they need to declare their electronic devices and then we package it and tag it and then they will get it at the destination. What we have done for the first and business classes on a complimentary bases is provide them with Microsoft tablets which are loaded with Microsoft 2016 programs so that they will be able to continue to work. If any pending work needs to be done, what they can do is load it onto a flash drive and then continue working on board on the tablets that are provided.  This is what we have done to address the situation. The law doesn’t apply to flights which go via Milan and Athens, these two flights will continue with customers having their electronic devices on board. Capital: A lot of Ethiopians travel to Dubai either for vacation or on business. How has that number increased the last few years? Nair: I think it has come a long way. If I run the numbers only from 2015 to 2016, it has nearly doubled.  That clearly shows that the demand for Dubai is ever growing and increasing. One of the features Dubai has to offer it is constantly introducing new things for people to see and experience. Last year, Dubai introduced two theme parks; the Dubai Parks and the IMG. Dubai as a destination has kept the interest of Ethiopians and we can see the results of that with the almost doubled numbers of travelers. That is a very encouraging fact for us. Capital: What is your marketing strategy for Dubai so that more visitors come? Nair: We have a company called Emirates Holidays which is part of the Emirates group and we develop leisure packages that are all inclusive packages which have hotels, car hires, exciting tours and so on. We come up with tailor made offers for different segments of the society in Ethiopia and advertize it to customers. A lot of people like these packages and so we are constantly keep on innovating, come up with offers and deals and we do partner up with certain properties and certain theme parks to make things attractive for the customers and that keeps on creating interest for the customers.

(Source: US Airforce) The US military’s experimental X-37B space plane landed on Sunday at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida, completing a classified mission that lasted nearly two years, the Air Force said. The unmanned X-37B, which resembles a miniature space shuttle, touched down at 7:47 a.m. EDT (1147 GMT) on a runway formerly used for landings of the now-mothballed space shuttles, the Air Force said in an email. The Boeing-built space plane blasted off in May 2015 from nearby Cape Canaveral Air Force Station aboard an Atlas 5 rocket built by United Launch Alliance, a partnership  between Lockheed Martin Corp and Boeing Co. The X-37B, one of two in the Air Force fleet, conducted unspecified experiments for more than 700 days while in orbit. It was the fourth and lengthiest mission so far for the secretive program, managed by the Air Force Rapid Capabilities Office. The orbiters “perform risk reduction, experimentation and concept-of-operations development for reusable space vehicle technologies,” the Air Force has said without providing details. The cost of the program is also classified. Also Read: SpaceX launches top-secret spy satellite for US government The Secure World Foundation, a nonprofit group promoting the peaceful exploration of space, says the secrecy surrounding the X-37B suggests the presence of intelligence-related hardware being tested or evaluated aboard the craft. The vehicles are 29 feet (9 meters) long and have a wingspan of 15 feet, making them about one quarter of the size of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s now-retired space shuttles. The X-37B, also known as Orbital Test Vehicle, or OTV, first flew in April 2010 and returned after eight months. A second mission launched in March 2011 and lasted 15 months, while a third took flight in December 2012 and returned after 22 months.

The Air Force intends to launch the fifth X-37B mission from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, located just south of the Kennedy Space Center, later this year.

(Xinhua/Ding Ting) China took a major step toward becoming a global aviation powerhouse as its homegrown large passenger plane, the C919, took to the sky on Friday. The flight makes China the fourth jumbo jet producer after the United States, Western Europe and Russia. It also marks a milestone for the Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC), the Shanghai-based manufacturer of the C919. The twin-engine plane departed from Shanghai Pudong International Airport with five crew members on board but no passengers. The plane took off at around 2 p.m. amid applause from more than 1,000 spectators on the tarmac, including Vice Premier Ma Kai and Shanghai Party chief Han Zheng. The flight lasted about 80 minutes. The "C" in the aircraft's name stands for both China and COMAC, while 9 symbolizes "forever" in Chinese culture, and 19 represents the 190 seats at maximum capacity. With a standard range of 4,075 kilometers, the narrow-body jet is comparable with updated Airbus 320 and Boeing's new generation 737 planes, signaling the country's entry into the global aviation market. The successful flight moves China one step closer to transforming itself from a manufacturer of low-cost goods to a creator of advanced technology. It marks a major breakthrough of China's large passenger plane project and a major landmark in the development of China's civil aviation industry, the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and the State Council said in a congratulatory letter. It is a great achievement made under the leadership of the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core, said the letter. "The maiden flight is exciting," said Wu Guanghui, the C919's chief designer, hailing it as the start of a new era in China's advanced manufacturing. China has taken pride in developing the homegrown jumbo jet, regarding it as a symbol of national strength. It began developing its own large passenger jets in the 1970s and the first one, the Y-10, had a successful test flight in 1980. But the project was later abandoned. In 2007, the State Council approved plans to develop a large passenger jet. In November 2015, the first C919 jet rolled off the assembly line. More than 200,000 technicians worked on the project. The jet was designed and produced in China and made with resources from around the world. It is an achievement in global cooperation, said Wu. The C919 incorporated parts from over 30 global suppliers such as Honeywell International Inc. Its engines were made by a joint venture between General Electric and Safran Aircraft Engines. The flight marks the culmination of a successful collaboration between Safran and China. "We are very confident that the C919 will play a more important role in the world aviation industry," said Olivier Dubroeucq, Safran executive vice president of the COMAC and AVIC Programs. "China is willing to share growth opportunities with the rest of the world. For Honeywell, which has invested heavily in China's aviation industry, we are picking the winner," said Steven Lien, president of Honeywell Aerospace Asia Pacific. Despite the successful test flight, it may still take time for the C919 to take off in the market. Shaking the dominance of giants Boeing and Airbus in the near future is unrealistic, observers say, but the Chinese jetliner could be a strong option for global carriers in decades to come. A total of 23 foreign and domestic customers, including China's national carrier Air China, have placed orders for 570 aircraft, according to COMAC. But this is only the very first step. Even in China's domestic market, COMAC has a long way to go to turn technical success into business success. Boeing predicted last year that China will become the world's top aviation market within 20 years, projecting a demand for more than 6,000 new aircraft in the next two decades with a total value of 1 trillion U.S. dollars. China will need 5,110 new single-aisle airplanes through 2035, accounting for 75 percent of the total new deliveries, according to Boeing. The C919 will be a strong competitor in this field as it is economical and comfortable, according to a research note from Guosen Securities. COMAC will seek airworthiness certificates from the Civil Aviation Administration of China and foreign aviation safety regulators before making its first deliveries slated for around 2019.

What was it doing up there in the sky? The government won't say. Even the spaceplane's budget is a secret. But the X-37B's landing wasn't so stealthy. The spaceplane caused a sonic boom that woke up people living near NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida. GIF made from US Air Force videos of the X-37B spaceplane landing at NASA 's Kennedy Space Center on 7 May 2017 (US Air Force) Something just went thru the sound barrier. Big sonic boom over my house!!! 🚀💥 — eHardin ♱ (@eHardinda) May 7, 2017 The secret, reusable spaceplane is made by Boeing and is unmanned, allowing it to conduct extended missions, even if the public has no idea what those missions might be. This was the X-37B's fourth mission (all secret, of course), and the spaceplane typically lands in California, not Florida. Again, we don't know enough about the spaceplane's purpose to speculate about why it landed in Florida and woke up the neighbours this time around. The spaceplane beat its own previous record of 674 days in orbit after landing in October of 2014. At that time the speculation was that the US Air Force was using the X-37B for some kind of surveillance of China's space station. Photo of the X-37B provided by the US Air Force after the spaceplane at NASA 's Kennedy Space Center on 7 May 2017 (US Air Force) The X-37B Orbital Test Vehicle (OTV) has now spent an astonishing 2085 cumulative days in orbit since its first mission in April of 2010. When the spaceplane first took off on its most recent mission on 20 May 2015, David Bowie, Leonard Cohen and Prince were all still alive, and Donald Trump was still a month out from announcing his bid for president — something that was met with little more than jokes at the time. Photo of the X-37B provided by the US Air Force after the spaceplane at NASA 's Kennedy Space Center on 7 May 2017 (US Air Force) "The landing of OTV-4 marks another success for the X-37B program and the nation," X-37B program manager Lt Col Ron Fehlen said in a statement without giving away the plot of this real-life mystery movie we seem to be living in. "This mission once again set an on-orbit endurance record and marks the vehicle's first landing in the state of Florida," Fehlen continued. "We are incredibly pleased with the performance of the space vehicle and are excited about the data gathered to support the scientific and space communities. We are extremely proud of the dedication and hard work by the entire team." "The hard work of the X-37B OTV team and the 45th Space Wing successfully demonstrated the flexibility and resolve necessary to continue the nation's advancement in space," Randy Walden, the director of the Air Force Rapid Capabilities Office, said in a statement. "The ability to land, refurbish, and launch from the same location further enhances the OTV's ability to rapidly integrate and qualify new space technologies." The US Air Force provided three videos of the landing, along with several photos. We've uploaded the three videos above for your viewing pleasure. As best I can tell, there's no ET in sight. Here are a few photos of the X-37B on its way to a hangar at the Kennedy Space Center. Image: US Air Force And this one from behind: Image: US Air Force As for this one, I'm not sure these guys understand the whole "secret" part of their project: Image: US Air Force But it's a good thing that this mini-shuttle is unmanned. If I'd left Earth in May of 2015 and had a two year mission I'm not sure I'd want to come back in 2017.

What exactly it does up there is classified. Most Popular U.S. Air Force By Jay Bennett May 8, 2017 The X-37B spacecraft operated by the U.S. Air Force landed at Kennedy Space Center on the morning of May 7, causing a sonic boom that was heard by residents across central Florida. The unmanned spaceplane spent 718 days in orbit before coming down, about a month and a half longer than the craft's previous record of 674 days. The Air Force operates two X-37Bs, which are reusable spaceplanes built by Boeing that launch on Atlas V rockets for extended missions in orbit. Similar to the Space Shuttle in appearance, the X-37B is only about a quarter of the size at 29 feet long. The spaceplane needs no cockpit or life support systems, and can operate in orbit for hundreds of days at a time. Like the Space Shuttle, the X-37B has double doors that cover a payload bay, which is about the size of the bed of a pickup truck. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Most Popular What exactly the Air Force uses the X-37B for is classified. The description of the spacecraft on the USAF website reads: "Managed by the Air Force Rapid Capabilities Office, the X-37B program is the newest and most advanced re-entry spacecraft that performs risk reduction, experimentation and concept of operations development for reusable space vehicle technologies." It has been widely speculated that the craft is used for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) missions, spying on operations in places like Iran and North Korea. Because the craft can land and have its payload swapped out whenever the Air Force deems it necessary, the X-37B could potentially be used for a number of missions and testing platforms. Experts have also guessed that the X-37B could be used for testing autonomous flight technologies, serve as a communications relay in orbit, or serve as a testing platform for systems that could ultimately be used on a manned spacecraft. The Air Force's X-37B Orbital Test Vehicle mission 4 lands at NASA 's Kennedy Space Center Shuttle Landing Facility, Fla., May 7, 2017. U.S. Air Force The operations of the X-37B might be classified, but there is no hiding it when it reenters the atmosphere and shakes the countryside with a sonic boom. This is the first time the craft has landed in Florida, having performed all three of its previous landings in California. Another mission using the X-37B is scheduled to launch from Cape Canaveral later this year. How long the X-37B will orbit this time, and what exactly it will be doing, is known only by a handful of people in the Department of Defense.

Download Our Free Report Law Schools, Politics, SCOTUS, Supreme Court Supreme Court Shortlister Turned General Counsel Calls Out The Court (Plus Presidents And Congress Too) Controversial comments from a leading judge turned general counsel. By David Lat May 8, 2017 at 4:43 PM Shares8 Judge J. Michael Luttig (via YouTube) Looking at the legal luminaries who have spoken or will speak at law school graduations this year, you’ll see a lot of celebrities. There are prominent politicians, like vice president Mike Pence, Governor Kate Brown, and Senators Cory Booker, Bob Casey, and Maggie Hassan. There are Biglaw boldface names, such as Roberta Kaplan, Ted Wells, Mary Jo White. There are famous former prosecutors, including Loretta Lynch, Preet Bharara, and Sally Yates. And there are judges, lots of judges (including such superstars as Judge Alex Kozinski of the Ninth Circuit and Judge Diane Sykes of the Seventh Circuit). For my money, though, one of the most notable names on the list is Judge J. Michael Luttig, the Fourth Circuit judge turned Boeing general counsel. Judge Luttig was appointed to the federal bench at the tender age of 37, and during his time as a judge, he developed a reputation as a great jurist and remarkable writer — who didn’t pull his punches, especially in dissent. His brilliance as a judge brought him thisclose to a Supreme Court seat, and among legal nerds, he became famous as a SCOTUS feeder judge. Judge Luttig sent almost all of his clerks — aka “Luttigators” — into Supreme Court clerkships.[1] Last Friday, Judge Luttig delivered the commencement address at the University of South Carolina School of Law. And true to form, he spoke with courage and candor, refusing to sugarcoat his remarks. He lamented the triumph of partisan politics over the rule of law, and he wasn’t shy about calling to task the actors who have brought about this sad state of affairs. For starters: One can’t help wondering what Judge Luttig would think of President Trump’s likely nominees to judicial office. But — contrary to the views of some progressives — not everything is Trump’s (or the executive branch’s) fault: So it sounds like Judge Luttig wasn’t a fan of what happened to the nominations of either Chief Judge Merrick Garland or then-Judge Neil Gorsuch, suggesting that the processes devolved into “partisan spectacle.” In contrast, note Judge Luttig’s warm words for the late Justice Antonin Scalia, calling his former boss (for whom he clerked on the D.C. Circuit) “the last Lion of the Rule of Law.”[2] But don’t think that Judge Luttig’s praise for Justice Scalia extends to all the justices or to the Supreme Court as an institution. Instead, SCOTUS bears some of the blame as well: He doesn’t name names, of justices or of cases, but we can all think of jurists or decisions that put politics ahead of law. It is, as Judge Luttig makes clear in his remarks, a sin committed on both sides of the aisle. These are just the juiciest parts; Judge Luttig’s speech is worth reading in its entirety. You can do so by flipping to the next page (or clicking here). P.S. In reading his remarks, I couldn’t help noticing Judge Luttig’s greeting of University of South Carolina President Harris Pastides, who happens to be a family friend (he went to college with my father-in-law). Speaking at a dinner held after commencement, Judge Luttig praised President Pastides as “a brilliant mind, a brilliant scholar, a brilliant educator, and a brilliant University President.” President Pastides has led the university since 2008, and USC has grown and flourished under his tenure. But 2016 will surely go down in history as one of the school’s best years ever, with the men’s basketball team making its Final Four debut and the women’s team winning the whole tournament. Go Gamecocks! [1] Depending on how you measure feeder-judge status, Judge Luttig might be the number-one feeder judge in history. Other judges, such as the aforementioned Judge Kozinski, have sent more clerks total to SCOTUS. But Judge Luttig surely is — and probably will remain, for many years — the biggest feeder judge in terms of the percentage of his clerks that have gone on to One First Street. Off the top of my head, I can think of only two Luttigators over the judge’s fifteen-year tenure who did not eventually clerk for the Court. [2] Yes, liberals would lash into Luttig for praising Justice Scalia as putting law over politics. Conservatives would defend Scalia by noting the many cases when his originalist method led to results he’d find politically unpalatable (e.g., wins for flag burners and criminal defendants). Lather, rinse, repeat — it’s a familiar debate, and one that we don’t need to rehash here.

By Ilana Novick / AlterNet May 8, 2017 Print Comments May Day protest in New York City, 2017. Photo Credit: Ilana Novick "You must pick a side," Deborah Axt said of corporate America on a recent press call. "Either you stand with our communities or with hate." Axt, who is the co-executive director of immigration advocacy organization Make The Road New York, was launching Corporate Backers of Hate, a new campaign from Make The Road New York and the Center for Popular Democracy in collaboration with a coalition of other immigrant and labor advocacy organizations. The new campaign targets nine companies—JP Morgan Chase, Wells Fargo, Goldman Sachs, IBM, Disney, Boeing, BlackRock, Uber, and Blackstone—that are close to the Trump administration and have a financial stake in his most abusive policies, particularly immigrant detention and attacks on workers' rights.  The campaign began with a website, where visitors can learn about the nine companies' labor practices and violations and their connections to private prisons and immigrant detention centers. Armed with that information, people can use the site to contact the companies and encourage them to withdraw their investments and refrain from bidding on the opportunity to participate in Trump's border wall construction. There will also be a social media strategy and an upcoming campaign to encourage cities and states to limit business dealings with the nine companies.  The site also has a calendar with opportunities to join upcoming direct actions at the companies' offices across the country, to further remind them that, as Ana Maria Archila, co-executive director of Center for Popular Democracy noted, "you are on notice... Trump's agenda is not just ideological, but economic. We want to make sure the public understands."  The organizers hope to make Americans aware of just how connected these companies are to the larger anti-immigration agenda, and just how easily one's hard-earned money can inadvertently go to corporations whose business practices hurt the most vulnerable. The Corporate Backers of Hate site clearly lays out the connections, making it much easier for consumers to fight back. Many Americans will have to wait until 2018 until they can vote for elected officials, but until then, they can vote with their dollars.  Axt explained that the success of these policies "depends heavily on how much collaboration [Trump] receives from companies willing to finance it." Taking inspiration from the success of the anti-Dakota Access Pipeline campaign, which convinced cities including Seattle to divest from companies that supported the project, Corporate Backers of Hate wants to expand public outcry against Trump to include the companies that make his agenda possible. As Matt Nelson, executive director of Presente, explains, now is the best time to extend the momentum of campaigns like GrabYourWallet, which helps consumers boycott Trump products: "Companies are at an all-time high of vulnerability to public pressures... this campaign marks a new phase of corporate accountability." After all, he notes, "Millions of people are taking daily action, demanding companies be very clear in not siding with Trump.  For example, JP Morgan Chase donated $500,000 to Trump's inaugural committee. Along with Wells Fargo, the two are among the largest financiers of America's largest private prison companies, the GEO Group and CoreCivic. BlackRock has an 11 percent stake in CoreCivic and a 12 percent stake in the GEO Group. Manuel A., a member of Make The Road New York, told reporters about escaping gang violence in El Salvador, only to come to America and face a two-month stay in a CoreCivic Facility inmates called the Ice Box, because it was kept so cold. Manuel said, "I felt like a criminal... did not have my freedom, could not see my family. [Prison staff] blocked my calls and I had to work inside [the] detention center and was paid $1 a day... That's not enough to pay a lawyer."  The direct actions began May 1, when 12 immigration advocates were arrested outside of JP Morgan's New York City headquarters. Those arrested included Center for Popular Democracy's Ana Maria Archila. The protesters carried signs saying "Our Profit, Our Pain” and chanted, “¡Chase, escucha, estamos en la lucha!” ("Chase, listen, we’re in the struggle!"). According to the organizers, this is the beginning of a nationwide series of direct actions, social media campaigns, and eventually, boycotts. All of the organizers acknowledged that in order to convince the companies to divest from private prisons and the looming border wall, it's not enough to appeal to their morals; one has to appeal to their bottom line. Just as Fox News fired Roger Ailes and Bill O'Reilly because they feared losing advertisers, the nine companies must be convinced that their profits will tank in order for the campaigns to make a difference. As Sulma Arias, immigration field director of Fair Immigration Reform Movement, says, "Every place they face the public, they will be held accountable. They should feel their brand is vulnerable any place they interact with the public."

During the spacewalk, the ESA’s Thomas Pesquet and NASA’s Shane Kimbrough prepared the Pressurized Mating Adapter-3 for a second International Docking Adapter, which will allow commercial crew vehicles to dock. Scroll down for video  Pesquet and Kimbrough disconnected cables and electrical connections, allowing PMA-3 to later move from the port side of the Tranquility module to the space-facing side of the Harmony module, the space agency explains A NEW PARKING SPOT In March, astronauts on the ISS began to make preparations for the installation of the second of two parking spots for space taxis, known as the International Docking Adapters. New crew spaceships, being designed by SpaceX and Boeing, will use them when they begin flying astronauts to the station in the coming years, as early as 2018. Currently, the only way the world's astronauts can reach orbit is by buying a ride aboard Russia's Soyuz capsules, at $81 million per seat.  The riveting footage released on YouTube by NASA today was captured by Pesquet on March 24 ahead of the Pressurized Mating Adapter-3’s (PMA-3) robotic move on March 26. Pesquet and Kimbrough disconnected cables and electrical connections, allowing PMA-3 to later move from the port side of the Tranquility module to the space-facing side of the Harmony module, the space agency explains. The video shows the task from the astronaut’s perspective as they carry out the hands-on mission on the outside of the ISS. And, it also gives a breathtaking view of Earth as seen from far above. The spacewalk was conducted to prep the PMA-3 for the docking adapter, which will be delivered by a SpaceX Dragon cargo craft. Along with this, the team installed a new computer relay box on the starboard zero truss, bringing advanced software to the adapter.

The spacewalk was just Pesquet’s second, while it was the fifth for Kimbrough. During an interview on NASA TV the week of the spacewalk, Kimbrough admitted ‘Going outside is always a gee-whiz moment for me.’  Just days after the spacewalk featured in the ‘action cam’ footage, Kimbrough returned to the outside with astronaut Peggy Whitson for her record breaking eighth spacewalk - the most ever performed by a woman.

At around 10:30 a.m., the spacewalking astronauts lost an important piece of shielding needed for the International Space Station, forcing them to carry out an impromptu patch. The cloth bundle floated away midway through the spacewalk. Spacewalkers have lost things before, including an entire tool kit in 2008. But the getaway items are usually small, like bolts.

Just last month, Whitson broke another record after achieving the longest time spent in space by an American. And, she’s extended her trip three months. By the time she lands back on Earth in September, Dr Whitson will have spent 666 days in orbit.

At stake for SpaceX are potential billions in revenue. Meanwhile, rumors continue on Apple jumping into space by funding Boeing's proposed satellite network. SpaceX plans to put an initial 4,425 satellites distributed across 83 orbital planes – think slices – at altitudes between roughly 1,100 kilometers to 1,300 kilometers above the earth, according to testimony given by Vice President of Satellite Government Affairs Patricia Cooper to the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Technology.    The satellites will deliver broadband using Ka- and Ku-band radio frequencies and move data among each other using laser links in a mesh network.  Since the satellites will be much closer to the earth than geosynchronous communications satellites at 36,000 kilometers in the sky, latency will be much lower and won't have the delays and lag associated with traditional satellite services.  A second-generation network would add an additional 7,500 lower flying satellites delivering services in the V-band to provide more capacity and reduce latency in highly-populated areas. SpaceX founder and CEO Elon Musk has said the low-orbiting satellite network would even be faster than traditional fiber-based networks because laser signals would be traveling in straight lines through empty space, rather than slower by following a wandering path through glass cables and multiple routers. SpaceX will launch a first pathfinder satellite before the end of the year and a second one early in 2018. Once the technology has been successfully demonstrated, SpaceX plans to start launch satellites in mass starting in 2019 with the full 4,425 constellation to be finished by 2024.  By 2025, various estimates say the network could be generating tens of billions – yes, billions – of dollars per year, generating enough cash to fund building a fleet of spaceships to colonize Mars. How close is the SpaceX network to becoming reality? Having successfully demonstrated the ability to re-use the first stage of its Falcon 9 rocket – the most expensive part of its launch system – SpaceX should have a fleet of “flight-proven” first stage hardware to put to work.  It will need to ramp up flight operations from a launch of every two weeks in 2017 to performing multiple flights per week at some point.  The math is simple – 4400 satellites in orbit, five years to put the full network in orbit, translating to an average of 880 satellites per year, or about 88 satellites per month, with two months worked in for paying customers, such as the U.S. government and commercial satellite operators.  That would be around 22 SpaceX satellites launched per week, so call it around two to three launches per week, carrying up eight to 12 satellites into orbit at a time. If increasing flight rates from twice a month to two to three times a week isn’t enough of a challenge for SpaceX, the other “long pole” is a factory dedicated to crank out satellites in the quantities necessary.  Consider OneWeb, planning to orbit a mere 900 satellites in total for its satellite broadband cloud, is spending $85 million for a new factory next to Cape Canaveral that will crank out up to three satellites a day. SpaceX will need its own dedicated manufacturing facility operating at similar to or faster production rates to meet its satellite needs.  Fortunately, SpaceX can tap into the experience of its own rocket production as well as potentially that of Musk-owned Tesla, which has built facilities to build cars and lithium ion batteries. But SpaceX isn't alone in looking to the sky for profits. Apple has hired two of Google's satellite people, reports Bloomberg. There have been long standing rumors this year that Apple is funding Boeing's effort to build a large broadband satellite constellation. In 2016, Boeing applied for a Federal Communications Commission (FCC) license to build an initial network of 1,396 satellites operating in the V-band spectrum,  growing the network to 2,956 satellites over time. Apple has more cash than common sense these days, sitting on a Smaug-like hoard of nearly $257 billion as of a couple weeks ago.  While Apple shareholders love fat dividends, the company hasn't had a “Next Great Thing” in quite a while, fumbling about with projects in autonomous cars and  a rumored TV set/over-the-top streaming network, while failing to do simple things like regularly update its laptop and desktop lines. Boeing has the core expertise in communications satellite technology, but would have to translate it into a mass production model.  Could an Apple/Boeing collaboration work? It's an intriguing combination, but both companies will have to embrace a fast-moving ethos akin to Apple's glory days, rather than the plodding pace Apple runs at today.   Author Info Doug Mohney Contributing Editor Click here to read full bio SHARE THIS ARTICLE Tweet Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. blog comments powered by Disqus Related Articles SpaceX and Apple's Dreams of Satellite Broadband Billions By: Doug Mohney    5/8/2017 Last week on Capitol Hill, SpaceX told a Senate committee about its plans to build a massive satellite constellation to provide broadband services aro… Read More Tech Innovations that Will Change the Education System By: Lindsey Patterson    5/4/2017 A lot of people today complain about the state of public education.

Workers in protective suits check out the Air Force’s X-37B Orbital Test Vehcile after its touchdown at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center Shuttle Landing Facility. (U.S. Air Force Photo) After nearly two years in orbit, the U.S. Air Force’s X-37B robotic space plane landed at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida today with a loud sonic boom, but nary a word about what exactly it was doing up there all this time. This was the fourth and longest classified mission for the Boeing-built craft, which was launched from Florida 718 days earlier in 2015 atop a United Launch Alliance Atlas 5 rocket. The three earlier missions were flown in 2010, 2011-2012 and 2012-2014, with landings at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. The Air Force’s fleet of X-37B Orbital Test Vehicles has now spent a total of 2,085 days to gauge the reusable winged plane’s ability to conduct on-orbit operations and return for airplane-style horizontal landings. “The landing of OTV-4 marks another success for the X-37B program and the nation,” Lt. Col. Ron Fehlen, X-37B program manager, said in an Air Force news release. “This mission once again set an on-orbit endurance record and marks the vehicle’s first landing in the state of Florida. We are incredibly pleased with the performance of the space vehicle and are excited about the data gathered to support the scientific and space communities.” The purpose of the X-37B program has been a mystery for well more than a decade. Precursor prototypes were rumored to be designed as “space bombers,” but more recent speculation has downplayed the plane’s potential use against terrestrial targets. Instead, the plane is seen as an experimental test bed for military space technologies. “The primary objectives of the X-37B are twofold: reusable spacecraft technologies for America’s future in space and operating experiments which can be returned to, and examined, on Earth,” the Air Force says in its X-37B fact sheet. Such experiments are thought to include a new type of rocket thruster built by Aerojet Rocketdyne, new sensors for intelligence gathering, and new tools for deploying and retrieving payloads in space. Randy Walden, director of the Air Force Rapid Capabilities Office, took special note of the first-ever Florida landing. “The ability to land, refurbish and launch from the same location further enhances the OTV’s ability to rapidly integrate and qualify new space technologies,” he said. The Air Force says it’s preparing to launch its fifth top-secret X-37B mission from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida later this year.

Over 1,200 virtual, mixed, and augmented reality creators were in Hollywood last week for the Vision Summit, hosted by Unity Technologies, to learn what's next in the realm of the unreal. There, PCMag sat down with executives from Vuforia, leading VR animation studio Baobab, and Scope AR, which specializes in AR-based remote connectivity for businesses. Vuforia has extended its Smart Terrain platform to support Google Tango devices (like the Lenovo Phab 2 Pro), which will allow for room-scale AR experiences. Smart Terrain lets developers define objects within 3D meshes, so consumers can interact in a seamless way between the real and the augmented visual layer. It's still a work in progress, so in the meantime, Jay Wright, president and general manager, used toys for some Vuforia-based VR/AR demos from companies like SwapBots. The UK-based startup lets users "put blocks together to create new characters and then they do things together," Wright explained. Viewed through a Vuforia-enabled mobile device, a blue and pink gelatinous creature was triggered by a SwapBot block and gurgled oddly in mid-air. Wright turned to a member of the Vuforia demo team. "Can you make it so the sombrero works, too?" And there it was; the octopus-style creature morphed into Mexican hat-wearing mode before our eyes. It was fun, engaging, and one got the memo that toys that don't go 4D are dead now. "Every toy manufacturer in the market today, including Lego, has something in play with Vuforia," Wright said. "We don't put new technology into Vuforia until we can deliver in a robust fashion." It's a good point; there's plenty of vaporware in the market. Another company with an actual business model is Scope AR. CEO and co-founder Scott Montgomerie gave PCMag a demo of RemoteAR, which is being used by clients including Boeing, Caterpillar, and Lockheed Martin. "I developed a computer vision technology as part of an earlier startup and found a market much later when a mining company came to us and said, 'Hey, can we use this for training?'," Montgomerie said. "So we did a quick AR proof of concept with them showing how to replace a fuse on one of their massive high-capacity haul trucks, which are as high as a two-story house. The problem they faced was their equipment is very expensive, and not easy to maintain, so their dream was to have in-the-field, on-the-fly training. That's what we built for them." During a demo, we grabbed a tablet and played the role of an on-site maintenance engineer learning how to replace parts on a rock drill drive shaft. Montgomerie, who played the role of teacher back at a manufacturer's headquarters, drew on a tablet of his own, offering step-by-step instructions and virtually walking us through the procedure. Everything he did showed up on our tablet, in real time, with accompanying audio/video support "One of the most amazing moments in The Matrix is when Trinity requests the program to fly a B-212 helicopter," Montgomerie said. "RemoteAR is kinda like that. We're not there yet—we need a cognitive brain implant—but this is one step on the way." It's true. Should I find myself in a shaft mining colliery (you never know), I'm confident I could repair anything—if connected to RemoteAR. Our final meeting was with Maureen Fan, CEO and co-founder of VR animation studio Baobab, which has raised over $31 million (20th Century Fox and Shanghai Media Group are among its investors) and attracted talent from Dreamworks, Pixar, and Zynga. Fan gave us a sneak peek of its latest project, Rainbow Crow, an animated VR series with voice talent from John Legend, Diego Luna, and Constance Wu. The idea is to feel as though you are "walking inside a dream"—Fan's favorite description of merging reality and animated worlds. Related First Look at IMAX's VR Experience Centre First Look at IMAX's VR Experience Centre Baobab's team draws heavily on neuroscience research to affect emotion; it has done "a lot of research, drawing on the neuroscience notion of 'mirror neurons'—as in the main character mirrors your actions to build connection and emotions," Fan said. The company is testing different business models with every release, from subscriptions, pay per view, and in-app purchases to ticket sales from VR-enabled movie theaters. Hollywood has noticed. Roth Kirschenbaum Films—started by Joe Roth, former Chairman of Walt Disney Studios and Jeffrey Kirschenbaum, former president of Universal—is partnering with Baobab to make one of its earlier projects, Invasion, into a full-length feature. The past few years have seen an explosion in experiments around VR, AR, and MR, including mental health, chronic pain, urban planning, the rehabilitation of wounded warriors, and re-entry from military into civilian life. What was clear from this year's Vision Summit is that manufacturing, heavy industry, and Hollywood have now entered the game and found a way to make it pay.

The US Air Force wants to remind you (and China) that its secret space drone is back Written by Tim Fernholz Obsession Space Business May 08, 2017 Nothing to see here. (Reuters/US Air Force) Share Written by Tim Fernholz Obsession Space Business May 08, 2017 One of the weirdest open secrets in space has come back to earth: The X-37B, an experimental US Air Force drone that looks and flies like a miniature Space Shuttle, landed at Kennedy Space Center on May 7 with a sonic boom that surprised local residents. The autonomous craft spent 718 days in space. Unlike its previous three trips, when the Air Force provided few details about its mission, this time military spokespeople can point to two totally not nefarious at all science projects. While more speculative analysts suspect electronic espionage directed at Chinese spacecraft, the US Air Force says this is just a run-of-the-mill experimental craft designed to demonstrate reusable space technology can survive radiation, volatile temperatures and micro-asteroids. The #X37B #OTV4 is the newest and most advanced re-entry spacecraft. Find out more about today's landing here: https://t.co/GUGgOMQiYg pic.twitter.com/HfHHVnWhYc — U.S. Air Force (@usairforce) May 7, 2017 “The landing of OTV-4 [the name of this mission] marks another success for the X-37B program and the nation,” Lt. Col. Ron Fehlen, the officer who manages the program, said in a statement. “This mission once again set an on-orbit endurance record and marks the vehicle’s first landing in the state of Florida. We are incredibly pleased with the performance of the space vehicle and are excited about the data gathered to support the scientific and space communities.” This flight featured the test of an advanced US Air Force engine, designed to propel spacecraft using thrusters powered by electrically charged particles, as well as a NASA experiment to evaluate how dozens of different materials withstand long-term exposure to space. The fourth flight of the Boeing-built spacecraft began with a launch on May 20, 2015. To reach space, the X-37B flies inside a faring—an aerodynamic nose cone—on top of an Atlas rocket, built by the Boeing-Lockheed Martin joint venture United Launch Alliance. On landing, however, it flies back through the atmosphere like a plane, landing on the enormous runway at Kennedy Space Center where its predecessor, the Space Shuttle, would land when it was in regular service. Despite the secrecy around the project’s purpose, the US Air Force regularly releases video and imagery of the craft to the media, and there is an enormous “Home of the X-37B” sign on the outside of Boeing’s facility at KSC. There is rising interest in how low-cost access to space will effect national security—in brief: It could be very destabilizing indeed if new players and advanced weapons become feasible thanks to reusable rockets. The US putting its own secret space project on full display should be taken as an advertisement of American capabilities in space. Amateur astronomers (and no doubt other governments) have tracked the X-37b as it changes orbits, appears to track other satellites or maintains a stable orbit over a specific part of the globe. Even as Russia and China surreptitiously test anti-satellite weapons, the US is reminding them that it has a maneuverable spacecraft capable of hanging out quietly in orbit, shadowing their space assets, and doing, well, who knows what?

By Bethany Allen-Ebrahimian / Foreign Policy Cheap Chinese steel has upset U.S. steel producers for years, as Chinese manufacturers have unloaded excess capacity on world markets at unbeatably low prices. The Trump administration has even invoked the supposed threat to national security from cheap imports to threaten trade restrictions on steel imports. But the United States has plenty of steel-manufacturing capacity to meet its defense needs. What’s genuinely threatened, however, is another sector altogether: Aluminum. A glut of cheap Chinese aluminum has done more than hollow out that industry; it may also actually be jeopardizing national security. Since China joined the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2001, cheap Chinese aluminum has flooded American markets, closing factories and putting people out of work. The number of aluminum smelters in the United States has fallen from 23 to five in that time. Eight smelters have either shut down or scaled back operations since 2015, and about 3,500 aluminum jobs have disappeared in the last 18 months alone. A bigger worry, however, is national security. High purity aluminum is used to make certain kinds of jets, such as Boeing’s F-18 and Lockheed Martin’s F-35, as well as armored vehicles. But the United States now has just one domestic manufacturer of high purity aluminum left — Century Aluminum’s Hawesville, Kentucky. plant, which is currently operating at 40 percent capacity amid dropping prices. The prospects for importing high purity aluminum, from a geopolitical risk standpoint, aren’t friendly; only a few smelters in the world produce it, and those are located mostly in Russia, the Middle East, and China. The situation prompted the Trump administration to launch a probe into aluminum imports on April 26, after launching a similar probe on steel earlier in the month. “It’s very, very dangerous, obviously, from a national defense point of view, to only have one supplier of an absolutely critical material,” said Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross at an April 26 press briefing. The probe invokes a portion of a Cold War-era law, known as section 232, which permits special protections for smelting in industries key to national security. The investigation would determine whether or not the United States produces enough high purity aluminum to meet its needs during wartime. “You’re really left with just a kernel of the industry,” Jesse Gary, executive vice president and general counsel for Century Aluminum, told Foreign Policy. “Century Aluminum is only running at 40 percent capacity. As Secretary Ross mentioned, we truly are on the precipice of losing that smelter.” Punitive tariffs of more than 370 percent have previously been levied on aluminum imports from China. In the past year, the Departments of Justice, Commerce, and Homeland Security have coordinated multiple investigations into U.S. companies suspected of illegally dodging tariffs on aluminum. Relief under section 232 could be broader than tariffs, possibly including quotas or some other kind of remedy. But it still wouldn’t address the source of the problem — Chinese overcapacity. In fact, Chinese supply-side growth has continued unabated; it manufactured a new record of 2.95 million tons of aluminum in February. That overcapacity results from Chinese subsidies to major industries, including not just aluminum but also steel, cement, solar, and glass. As the Chinese export-based manufacturing model of economic development has run out of steam over the past decade, the government has feared the loss of jobs and potential unrest that might result if major industries fail. As a result, it has provided subsidies to keep factories in production and workers at their jobs. Many Chinese aluminum companies could not continue to operate at the size and scale they do without these subsidies. In fact, that China has an aluminum industry of such gargantuan size in the first place — it currently produces more than half the world’s supply — is something of an anomaly. Aluminum production is hugely energy intensive, and so is heavily dependent on access to cheap electricity. Iceland, for example, with its abundant geothermal energy, is one of the world’s leading producers of aluminum. But the market price for electricity in China is significantly higher than in the United States or Europe; big state-owned smelters in China benefit from subsidized electricity. Aluminum producing countries have been slow to mobilize. Steel production is spread out around the world, as many countries have their own steel industries, so a glut of Chinese steel affects a larger number of countries. But aluminum production is concentrated in just a few countries, those with cheap sources of electricity. “Steel has been much more vocal on this issue. We’ve been a step behind,” said Gary. “But the decline of the U.S. aluminum industry has been more steep than anything you’ve seen in steel. The expansion of the Chinese industry and the decline of the U.S. aluminum industry has been much more rapid.” But the U.S. seems to finally be getting serious about addressing the problem. In addition to Trump’s recent probe, in January the Obama administration launched a complaint to the World Trade Organization against Chinese aluminum subsidies. It’s the first such complaint filed to the WTO that addresses the root cause of Chinese overcapacity, rather than aiming to apply a band-aid like anti-dumping duties. Other aluminum-producing countries, including, Russia, Canada, Japan, and the European Union, have all asked to join that WTO request for consultation. On March 9, the Aluminum Association submitted a complaint to the World Trade Organization (WTO), requesting that anti-dumping duties be levied on aluminum foil imported from China. Representatives from the China Trade Taskforce, founded in 2015 with members including Aluminum Extruders Council, United Steelworkers Union, and Century Aluminum, traveled to London last week to lobby Britain and the EU for their support. “It does go to show that this problem is affecting all aluminum producing nations,” said Gary.   Most Read Marysville couple selling it all to travel the world By Steve Powell / Marysville Globe MARYSVILLE — Raising four boys, Roger… May 7th, 2017 Julie Muhlstein Program allows children with disabilities to play baseball Matthew Irish plays third base with Lakewood High School’s Cougars.

Built by Boeing, it blasted off in May 2015 from nearby Cape Canaveral Air Force Station aboard an Atlas 5 rocket built by United Launch Alliance. The X-37B conducted unspecified experiments for 718 days while in orbit, making this the fourth and lengthiest mission so far for the secretive program, managed by the Air Force Rapid Capabilities Office. According to the Air Force, it's used to "perform risk reduction, experimentation and concept-of-operations development for reusable space vehicle technologies."

Irene Klotz, reporting for Reuters: The U.S. military's experimental X-37B space plane landed on Sunday at NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida, completing a classified mission that lasted nearly two years, the Air Force said. The unmanned X-37B, which resembles a miniature space shuttle, touched down at 7:47 a.m. EDT (1147 GMT) on a runway formerly used for landings of the now-mothballed space shuttles, the Air Force said in an email. The Boeing-built space plane blasted off in May 2015 from nearby Cape Canaveral Air Force Station aboard an Atlas 5 rocket built by United Launch Alliance, a partnership between Lockheed Martin and Boeing. The X-37B, one of two in the Air Force fleet, conducted unspecified experiments for more than 700 days while in orbit. It was the fourth and lengthiest mission so far for the secretive program, managed by the Air Force Rapid Capabilities Office. nasa politics usa ← You may like to read: → Artificial Intelligence Closes In On the Work of Junior Lawyers World Reacts To The Worst Mass Shooting In U.S. History The Case Against a Universal Basic Income The FBI Recommends Not To Indict Hillary Clinton For Email Misconduct Trump's Next Immigration Move To Affect H-1B Visas; Require Tech Companies To Try To Hire Americans First: Bloomberg Peter Thiel Is Joining Donald Trump's Transition Team Splitting Up With Apple is a Chipmaker's Nightmare Unmanned US Air Force Space Plane Lands After Secret, Two-Year Mission More | Reply Login Unmanned US Air Force Space Plane Lands After Secret, Two-Year Mission Post Load All Comments  Full  Abbreviated  Hidden /Sea Score: 5 4 3 2 1 0 -1 More | Reply Login   Nickname: Password: Public Terminal Forgot your password?

Finland’s defence in focus Finland’s defence capability faces what the government has described as “an exceptional situation” in the 2020s, as the main core systems of both the country’s air force and army need to be phased out. Finland is set to go on a major military shopping spree said to be worth several billion euros. For a nation that does not have a reputation as one of the world’s big military spenders, and has allocated an average of little more than 1.54% of GDP to defence since 1988, a procurement programme on this scale represents a major step-change after so many years of seriously constrained military budgets. It provides a significant opportunity for the global defence industry and has already caught the interest of a number of international suppliers. Beyond replacing ships and aircraft, Helsinki’s shopping list also includes a counter artillery radar system, long-range, precision artillery projectiles, torpedoes – seemingly for the first time since WWII – and a controversial new kind of anti-personnel land mine. It all forms part of an overall plan to deliver a substantial capability boost in key pivotal areas in what the government’s Defence Report of January 2017 calls the “changed” operating environment of increased tension and military activity in the Baltic Sea region. HX fighter replacement programme The HX programme to replace the current fleet of 62 Boeing F/A-18 Hornet fighters is the biggest single project and by far the most expensive of the lot. "The HX programme to replace the current fleet of 62 Boeing F/A-18 Hornet fighters is the biggest single project and by far the most expensive." Despite around €2bn spent on various upgrades since 2000, a combination of structural fatigue, growing maintenance challenges and their widening capability gap against later, more-advanced aircraft mean that Finland’s Hornets will reach the end of their planned service life in 2025–2030. To maintain the capability of the air force beyond this point, the Finnish Ministry of Defence (MoD) launched its HX programme to identify a suitable multi-role replacement that can be brought into service as the existing fighters retire, and then remain viable in its role for at least 30 years. The MoD issued a request for information (RFI) to manufacturers in November 2016, and Boeing’s F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, BAE Systems’ Eurofighter, Dassault’s Rafale, Saab’s JAS Gripen-E and the Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II are reported to be amongst the possible contenders. With an estimated project value of between €7bn and €10bn, the final procurement decision is expected to be made by the early 2020s. Squadron 2020 The mid-2020s will also see the Rauma-class fast-attack missile craft and Hämeenmaa-class minelayers reaching the end of their service lives, with a total of seven vessels destined for decommissioning, to be replaced by four new ‘Squadron 2020’ ships at an estimated cost of €1.2bn. In addition the four Hamina-class fast-attack missile boats are scheduled for a mid-life upgrade to run between 2019 and 2021, which will include a torpedo-fit to improve the navy’s submarine-hunting capacity. In September 2016, Finland signed a letter of intent with Rauma Marine Constructions to build the Squadron 2020 vessels which will be designed to operate year-round in the Baltic, and perform patrol, mine-laying, anti-aircraft defence, anti-submarine and surface warfare tasks. That was followed in the December by the issuing of RFIs for the new ships’ battle systems to twelve companies – domestic and foreign – covering the full weapons, command and control and sensor package and invitations to tender are to follow for selected suppliers. Shipbuilding contracts are scheduled to be signed in 2019, and the first naval engineering tests are planned for 2020, with the last of the four due to be handed over to the Navy in 2024. Lessons from Ukraine Recent events in Ukraine arguably offered many possible lessons for nations on Russia’s border, but one above all – the enormous battlefield impact of artillery – has resonated particularly strongly with Finland’s military planners. During the conflict it was estimated that around 85% of the casualties were caused by artillery fire, which makes a powerful and obvious case for both the possession of such capability, and the acquisition of effective countermeasures to defend against it. As a result, Finland is set to beef up its already impressive arsenal, looking to complement its existing inventory of big-calibre artillery, heavy grenade launchers and multiple launch rocket systems with a future generation of long-range, high precision munitions. It has also been decided that counter artillery radar should be one of a number of high-priority programmes marked out for accelerated procurement, and the MoD aims to have the whole process completed, with the new radar in place and operational, by 2020. According to the Finnish Armed Forces, six or perhaps seven possible systems could be in the running, including offerings from Elta Systems, Saab and Raytheon, with an overall project value reported to run into tens of millions of euros. Courting controversy Aircraft, ships and artillery systems are one thing; landmines are something altogether different and Finland’s intention to field a replacement for devices prohibited by international agreement was always going to prove contentious. Despite a long held belief in the effectiveness of mines for area denial, Finland signed the Ottawa Treaty in 2011 and by 2015 had destroyed its stockpile of over one million anti-personnel mines (APMs), retaining 16,500 for “training and research” – more than any other signatory state, according to the International Campaign to Ban Landmines. After the National Coalition Party openly called for a withdrawal from the treaty in 2014, Finland’s current round of military upgrades has once again put its stance on APMs under the spotlight. "At the heart of the controversy lies a new kind of domestically developed landmine." At the heart of the controversy lies a new kind of domestically developed landmine which seemingly launches itself into the air when triggered, and sprays fragments downwards from about waist height. While it has been argued that the largely steel construction of this new device makes it much easier to detect, critics rightly point out that it does nothing to make it less of a devastating threat to innocent civilians. With Finland preparing to add these APMs to its inventory as early as 2018, and looking for a possible export market in some of the other European countries reported to have shown an interest in the project, it remains to be seen if, as some have claimed, it really will put the future of the Ottawa Treaty in jeopardy. More spending to come? The Finns will doubtless argue that they feel more threatened now than they did, and that the defence landscape in their region has changed; certainly the rest of the measures outlined in January’s Defence Report would bear out that thinking. The wartime strength of Finland’s Defence Forces is set to rise by around 20% to 280,000, while it estimates that an additional €55m will be needed from 2018 to improve readiness, and a further €150m per year from 2021, over and above index adjustments, to maintain the level of materiel investments. While Russia continues to flex its muscles and the strategic importance of the Baltic region grows, it seems likely that there will be more spending to come.

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it By Rebekah Denn By Rebekah Denn May 8 at 10:00 AM Amanda Saab shares her point of view on religion during the “Dinner With Your Muslim Neighbor” she co-hosted in Seattle. (Meryl Schenker /For The Washington Post) Her face framed by a delicate floral-print headscarf, Amanda Saab stepped into a Safeway. Ninety minutes later, the cashier rang up her groceries: $218.45 between Amanda’s brimming cart and the one steered by her husband, Hussein. The couple called an Uber and loaded the bags into the trunk. The driver asked their plans. A dinner party, Amanda replied: “Would you like to come?” Inviting strangers was one point of the feasts that Saab, 28, prepares for what she calls “Dinner With Your Muslim Neighbor.” She cooks — often in her own home and sometimes, as on this vacation trip, in a borrowed kitchen — and the couple answers any questions guests might have about their religion. Amanda has had exposure to such questions, and the uncomfortable rise in fears about Islam, on a national stage. She’s learned that the answers — and any changes to hearts and minds — best unfold one tableful at a time. Reality TV devotees know the cooking part would be a breeze for Amanda, a fan favorite on Season 6 of Fox’s “MasterChef” in 2015. Friends and relatives knew it, too. Advancing from an Easy-Bake Oven at age 5 to a Kitchen­Aid mixer at 16, she baked tiered cakes and piles of pastries for her extended family’s weekly gatherings in her home town near Detroit, where the Muslim population is among the nation’s largest. On weekends, she stayed up past her bedtime to watch “Iron Chef America.” Amanda and Hussein Saab. (Meryl Schenker /For The Washington Post) Her religion seemed no more a public issue than anyone else’s when Hussein, 30, saw the “Master­Chef” casting call. “You would rock at this,” he told her, and judges agreed after tasting her baklava blood-orange cheesecake at the open auditions. When she survived the first rounds, viewers wrote about the joy of finally seeing a “hijabi” woman on an American cooking show, a fellow “Muslimah” who represented them so beautifully. They praised her favorite comfort food (kibbe neeyah, made with raw beef) and noted her graciousness and generosity as she baked turmeric-date cakes and French toast (with the first bacon she had ever fried, though she didn’t eat it). They asked where she bought her dainty headscarves (everywhere from Target to Haute Hijab). [What happens when two immigrants, five liberals and a Trump voter sit down to dinner] On the flip side came suspicious social-media posts and hurtful ones; she recalls viewers calling her oppressed, asking if she needed the permission of Hussein, a Boeing employee, to appear on the show, questioning her “true” motivations. “It made me realize: Just my existence in the world is bothersome to some people.” Ultimately, she was eliminated because of an underbaked cake. Home in Seattle when the episode aired, she decorated five fancy cakes and delivered them to a local food bank, moving forward. Amanda Saab checks the directions on a carton of matzoh meal while cooking dinner. (Meryl Schenker /For The Washington Post) ‘Have I played a part in that?’ Then came the 2016 election season. Unlike Hussein, who could walk through a crowd without drawing attention, the hijab flagged Amanda as a practicing Muslim, a literal target for people such as the shopper she overheard at a sporting-goods counter who said the guns on sale were needed against people like her. On TV, she heard then-candidate Donald Trump calling for a “complete shutdown” of Muslims entering the United States. Clearly, she said, a lot of people must not know any Muslims. Her voice cracked as she recalled the realization: “Have I played a part in that? Have I not reached out to people and given them an opportunity to meet me?” She told Hussein, “Let’s invite strangers over for dinner.” That’s a tall task in Seattle, where the difficulty of making new connections is so established it has its own name: the Seattle Freeze. That’s on top of standard suspicions of free and supposedly no-strings meals. Once again, the TV exposure helped. Amanda’s social media posts, with invitations to share them widely, brought more volunteer guests than their dinner table could handle. “I wish we could say that we don’t have feelings of contempt for Islam and what it appears to represent,” one local commented on Amanda’s blog after she wrote about the first dinner. She responded with an invitation to the next. Dinner With Your Muslim Neighbor became a regular event, its reach only broadening when the couple moved back to Michigan recently to be closer to their families as they started their own. Hussein Saab, left, leads a prayer before dinner. (Meryl Schenker /For The Washington Post) Hugs, gifts and questions One Friday in April, Amanda asked on Facebook whether anyone wanted to host a Seattle dinner three days later, when she and Hussein would be visiting. “I’ll do the cooking!” she added with a smiley face. Seven solid offers came in by day’s end, some from people she had met, some from people she hadn’t. The Saabs shopped near the home of their selected hosts, Stefanie and Nason Fox, whom they had met at a Seattle vigil for victims of the 2016 massacre at Pulse nightclub in Orlando. The dinner fell during the eight days of Passover, which her hosts observed. Researching the Jewish holiday’s dietary restrictions, Amanda purchased matzoh meal for the first time and arranged her menu around rules of chametz and kitniyot. The welcoming dinner table at the Fox home was set for eight with bright Fiestaware plates and clusters of white hydrangeas, fat beeswax candles alternating with tall lit tapers. Guests arrived bearing more flowers and made their introductions either to the Saabs or the Foxes, depending on whom they knew. (The Uber driver, babysitting grandchildren, texted her apologies.) They filled their plates from the Saabs’ buffet: salmon blanketed in caramelized onions with a contrasting bite from horseradish, rosemary-roasted potatoes, carrots with honey and thyme, a leafy salad, almond-garnished asparagus in an orange-yogurt sauce. Salmon with horseradish and caramelized onion. (Meryl Schenker /For The Washington Post) Roasted carrots with honey and thyme. (Meryl Schenker /For The Washington Post) Hussein led the group in an Arabic prayer, then asked Stefanie whether there was an appropriate Hebrew blessing to follow. After praise for the meal, the questions began. Where’s your family from? (Dearborn, Mich. Both have Lebanese ancestry.) Does Islam have sects like Christianity does? (Yes, Sunni and Shiite are the main ones.) And, eventually, a less-charged query: “Can I ask how you make your potatoes so crispy?” (Bottom rack of the oven, lots of olive oil.) “We’re not theologians,” Hussein said. “We’re not clerics. . . . We try to practice our faith as best we can, and we’ll answer any questions you throw at us as best we can.” Amanda described meeting Hussein in their mosque’s youth group, though they were friends for years before dating. Her mother did not wear a hijab at the time, she noted, but Amanda was a typically rebellious 16-year-old who questioned her religion, studied it and ultimately embraced the covering “to wear my faith outwardly, to remind myself of my inward faith and connection to God.” She donned the hijab midweek, months into the school year. Her Spanish teacher asked if she was a new student. Amanda Saab wipes away tears during an intense discussion. (Meryl Schenker /For The Washington Post) Tears and tool kits As congenial as it was, conversation throughout the two-hour meal was intense and sometimes tearful, covering doctrine and culture and extremism. Both Amanda and her hosts choked up describing the vigil where they met. A stranger yelled, “What are you doing here?” at the hijab-clad woman, steps away from where Stefanie and Nason Fox stood wearing shirts that read “Stop profiling Muslims.” Amanda ran over and embraced the then-strangers. “I’m just so sorry that you walked down the street and people are so terrible,” Stefanie Fox said. Stefanie works for a Jewish organization in Seattle, and noted that “I get a lot of hate mail in my job, but it’s not personal.” Emotions also cranked higher when Fox’s neighbor, Greg Pomrehn, said he doesn’t find his own faith as a Christian represented well in the media and can only imagine it’s the same or worse for Muslims. His wife, Charissa Pomrehn, said she had prayed as a Christian to know more about her Muslim neighbors and that the dinner was like the literal answer to her prayers — with food a “disarming” way to make the connection. “What you are doing, I think, shines a light,” Anjana Agarwal told Amanda. It’s easy to imagine such fraught topics going off the rails with different guides. It helped to have a social worker’s presence, trained in hearing other people’s perspectives. The question is how much one couple can do. The Saabs consider the investment of time and money worthwhile and plan to continue the dinners, but both have full-time jobs, with Amanda now overseeing a social services agency. Their first child is due this summer. Partnering with Michael Hebb, a teaching fellow at the University of Washington’s communication leadership department, they’re assembling a free online tool kit they hope others will use to hold their own dinners. From left: Dinner guests Anjana Agarwal, Charissa Pomrehn and Patricia Rangel. (Meryl Schenker /For The Washington Post) “There’s never been a more important time” for this, said Hebb, a former underground restaurateur who specializes in creating conversations on difficult topics, most recently a global project called “Let’s Have Dinner and Talk About Death.” He thinks Muslim-neighbor dinners can scale up the same way, to the hundreds or thousands — or hundreds of thousands. “If you give people the right tools, you’ll set them up for success.” At the Fox home, that night’s dinner concluded with Amanda’s macaroons and a kosher strawberry trifle. Guests embraced the Saabs and one another as they said good night, bearing ribbon-tied goody bags with date-filled maamoul and coconut cookies from a Middle Eastern bakery in Dearborn. If the country is seeing a rising tide of hatred and fear, Nason Fox told Amanda, the dinner had been “a ripple effect” of response, spreading farther than any of them might know. “There are so many stories,” she said. “Who’s hearing that and taking it in?” Denn is a freelance writer based in Seattle.

and positions companies for the future News provided by YourEncore, Inc. 08 May, 2017, 07:45 ET Share this article INDIANAPOLIS, May 8, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Companies are facing a drastic talent drain. Over 10,000 Baby Boomers retire every day. A shortage of 40 million educationally qualified technicians and scientists is forecast by 2020, and 50% of Science and Engineering workers will be eligible for retirement over the same time horizon. The gap between the skills-experience-wisdom of retiring Baby Boomers and that of up-and-coming Millennials is a serious talent vacuum that many employers cite as their #1 challenge in achieving their business objectives. YourEncore®, the leading provider of proven expertise to the life sciences and consumer goods industries, helps companies close this talent gap through their Alumni Advantage™ solution set. This suite of services includes client-specific Alumni Talent Communities, Alumni Knowledge Capture, and Alumni Mentoring programs, all of which can be designed and deployed within 90 days. "YourEncore pioneered the concept of alumni management services nearly 15 years ago with Procter & Gamble, Eli Lilly, and Boeing," said Mike Lewis, Chief Sales & Marketing Officer at YourEncore. "Since then, we have significantly evolved our model, moving from simple management to comprehensive engagement that allows clients to tap into the wisdom and experience of their knowledge workers both before and after they exit the company. Our expanding list of Alumni Advantage clients, including General Mills, Battelle, and others, is a testament to our performance in this space and the growing need for this type of service." YourEncore® Alumni Talent Communities enroll and engage retirees and other former company employees who have decided to join the "gig economy" as a freelancer. This provides a pool of highly experienced, immediately effective talent that is ready, willing, and able to be deployed as needed. In addition, YourEncore Alumni Talent Communities have access to on-going training, collaboration tools, and social events, all designed and delivered to ensure that those within the Community stay engaged and effective. Clients can focus on business requirements and alumni relationships, confident that their program is being run in accordance with all applicable rules and regulations and that back-office functions are being handled efficiently. YourEncore® Alumni Knowledge Capture allows companies to document mission-critical wisdom and the tacit, experiential knowledge that resides in the minds of key company experts … before they walk out the door. YourEncore brings a disciplined approach and unique expertise to this process, which is critical for meaningful and successful execution. YourEncore® Alumni Mentoring brings retirees and current employees together for shared learning, knowledge transfer, and overall development of business acumen and professional gravitas. Many high-potential, early-career Millennials can benefit from mentoring by a Boomer who has "been there, done that." And Boomers report they learn a lot from and enjoy these mentoring relationships, as well. "It was almost ten years ago when we first connected with YourEncore and started to discuss this 'crazy idea' of leveraging external talent and retirees from diverse industries to help accelerate innovation," said Peter Erickson, Executive Vice President, Innovation, Technology, and Quality at General Mills. "I am very grateful to YourEncore for their leadership and tenacity in advancing a new approach across our organization. I have no doubt that we have brought better new products, product renovations, and cost savings to market than we could have done on our own." "Given the seismic shifts taking place in today's workforce, companies need to think differently about how they utilize talent, and individuals need to think differently about how they approach work," said Lewis. "YourEncore is uniquely positioned to provide both groups with the solutions they need to successfully navigate and take advantage of this perfect storm that is today's economy."

It's a hush-hush project and conspiracy theories are flying!!! ﻿ By Ajith Vijay Kumar | Last Updated: Tuesday, May 9, 2017 - 09:05 Comment 0 Comment Pic/Video courtesy: US Air Force@Twitter Washington: Central Floridians woke up to the sounds of a sonic boom when US Air Force`s secretive X-37B aircraft returned to Earth after being in the space non-stop for 718 days. The touchdown of the Orbital Test Vehicle mission 4 (OTV-4) at the Kennedy Space Center has added to the mystery that has surrounded the X-37B programme ever since the launch of the aircraft in 1999. While OTV-1 spent 224 days in space the subsequent mission OTV-2 and OTV-3 operated for 468 days and 675 days respectively. OTV-4 was the fourth and longest-running mission run by the US Air Force`s Rapid Capabilities Office. The programme began as a NASA project but was later transferred to the Pentagon. The US Air Force has two X-37B planes built by Boeing and they are deceptively very small in size, at least when compared to a space shuttle. This X-37Bs also lift off vertically as a space shuttle and glide back to the earth in a planned sequence, just like other space shuttles made by NASA. Though the unmanned X-37Bs measure just 9 feet 6 inches in height and are 29 feet 3 inches long, the aircraft carries a phenomenal level of awe on its wings. The US Air Force has been very secretive about what exactly are the mission for which X-37B spends these long periods of time in the space. The payload that is carried by plane has been the biggest mystery of all. A report in airspacemag.com says that before the launch of OTV-4 in 2015, the Air Force had, for the first time, revealed two of the payloads: a NASA materials science experiment and an ionizing thruster being tested for the Air Force. Though the announcement did give some understanding about the hush-hush project, there is no official word forthcoming – expectedly – on what the aircraft was up to when it flew around us in a near-Earth orbit for close to two years. The US Air Force insists that the aircraft is being used to conduct “experiments” but what sort of experiments remains a mystery. So, here's a look at all the theories doing the rounds. Sensors and Surveillance The most believable inference that has been drawn by experts is that X-37B was deployed to conduct tests and experiment on advanced surveillance sensors. Given the low orbit, it flies in, the spacecraft can be quickly the spacecraft can be quickly manoeuvred to any precise location, faster than satellites, and start beaming live visuals to the bosses in Pentagon! “The smart money is on advanced surveillance sensors. The Air Force has never mentioned them directly, but everyone seems confident that they’re flying,” the airspacemag.com writes in an article. Space bombing Conspiracy X-37B may have the capabilities to drop bombs from outer space or shoot down/interfere with other satellites to cripple the enemy in the event of a war. However, other reports, like one by Popular Mechanics, have rejected the idea on the basis of the fact that changing an aircraft's orbital plane requires a great amount of thrust and that will in turn increase fuel consumption and reduce the range of the aircraft. Spy satellites and spying on China's space station Tiangong-1 With the NASA working on several projects to reduce the size of satellites and yet maintain the same level of operational efficiency, some theories have claimed that X-37B may be sending out small reconnaissance satellites to place them as 'American spies' in the space. Some other reports had claimed in 2015 that the X-37B was aimed at keeping track of China's Tiangong-1 space station from close quarters. However, owing to their different trajectories around the globe, that report was junked by experts as impossible. Whatever may be X-37B's mission in the space, the entire programme has triggered fears that it may the start of the weaponization of space.

Zunam Aero Listen Listening... / 4:44 In the next decade you may be flying on a tiny battery operated plane for as little as $25 to a destination you might have otherwise driven. Start-up Zunum Aero is building a fleet of hybrid-electric planes to handle those short flights with financial backers such as Boeing Horizon X and JetBlue Technology Ventures. In a news conference this month Zunum said it wanted to be flying routes of up to 700 miles by 2025 and up to 1,000 miles by 2030. CEO Ashish Kumar cities these advantages: Lowering operating costs 40-80 percent Filling the gap for smaller communities where airport flights are dwindling Door-to-door travel times cut by 50 percent Eventually Zunum would rely on batteries exclusively, but according to Aviation Weekly technology editor, Graham Warwick, "The battery technology isn't there yet." He told the BBC, "It's projected to come but it needs a significant improvement. Nobody thinks that it is going to happen anytime soon." Kumar says the battery technology is already here. Zunum is seen as the leader in the hybrid plane field, but the Seattle-based company has competition. The Washington Post reports Airbus has been developing its "E-Fan" hybrid electric aircraft since 2014. The Verge reports Uber, Airbus, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and Google are all developing "VOTLs" (vertical takeoff and landing aircraft). Zunum says the market for electric aviation is between $2 and 3 trillion.

Since 2009, the number of clauses around commercial items skyrocketed from 16 to 142,  according to a preliminary analysis by the Aerospace Industries Association (AIA). Of the 114 new clauses, 40 came from Congress through legislation and 76 from the White House or the government’s acquisition oversight councils, in the form of executive orders or FAR/DFARs cases. And of all of those clauses, most —109 — impact every vendor, not just military contractors, while 33 only are in the DFARs. Sign up for the online chat with Col. Brandon Pearce, NGA's chief information security officer, May 15, 12:30 p.m. Advertisement So over the past eight years, there has been a five-fold increase in commercial item regulations. This not only complicates vendors’ compliance efforts but also adds new complexities to negotiating contracts. Joe Fengler, who leads AIA Commercial Items Working Group, said at the recent Section 809 panel meeting in Arlington, Virginia, the extraordinary increase in acquisition regulations are costing agencies and vendors time and money. “The flow down requirements are huge for contractors and subcontractors,” said Fengler, whose full-time job is director of government affairs for Honeywell. He is a former staff member of the House Armed Service Committee and spent eight years as working on the budget and finance issues for the Army. “Over the last eight years, through the 5200 series guidance, the number of flow down requirements increased to 61 for companies and their supply chains. Companies are required to certify these requirements, and it’s a huge problem, especially when selling and buying on price.” Fengler is referring to the DoD’s swing to using lowest-price technically acceptable (LPTA) in the mid-2010s. It’s more than just concerns about LPTA, however. ‘If you’re a really good federal worker, you should welcome’ the reorganization plan, OMB says He said regulations such as the “don’t text while driving program” that the FAR Council promulgated in 2012 are examples of the difficulties of overseeing many of these regulations. Few would argue that texting while driving isn’t dangerous and something we all shouldn’t avoid, but asking a company such as Lockheed Martin or Boeing to make sure an employee of a tier-two subcontractor isn’t doing the equivalent of texting while driving appears to be unrealistic. And that’s where the Section 809 panel can help. Congress authorized the Section 809 panel in the 2016 Defense Authorization Act to review acquisition regulations related to DoD and make recommendations to streamline and improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the process to maintain the military’s technological advantage. The panel, which includes current and former acquisition experts such as the panel’s chairwoman Deirdre Lee, the former head of Defense procurement and administrator in the Office of Federal Procurement Policy; Elliott Branch, the Navy’s deputy assistant secretary for acquisition and procurement; Maj. Gen. Casey Blake, the Air Force’s deputy assistant secretary for contracting; and Claire Grady, the director of Defense procurement and acquisition policy. By the third quarter of 2018, the Section 809 panel is supposed to deliver Congress a report detailing whether each regulation should be kept as-is, changed or repealed. At the most recent meeting in April, Fengler tried to make the case for the panel to address this eyeopening increase of commercial item regulations. And Fengler said all of these regulations around commercial items impact how the government, and DoD more specifically, are viewed as customers. “Through these laws and regulations, as a commercial company we recognize that the customer comes with 141 regulations that aren’t required when we sell, for example, to Gulf Stream,” he said. “Honeywell and most commercial aerospace companies are not cost accounting standards (CAS) compliant. We do have standard costs. We have standard costs to repair an engine, for example. But under CAS, the government wants to know how many exact hours it will take, or what is the exact price of the products? For Honeywell or any large company to be CAS compliant on production items, it would require us to change the entire process.” Of course, the larger the company, the more costly it is to meet these regulations, and whether the government wants to admit it or not, those costs are passed back to them in the form of general accounting and overhead fees. This review of commercial items becomes even more important when you consider the spending rate by agencies. In fiscal 2016, 52 percent of all DoD actions were commercial in nature. These accounted for about 16 percent of all obligations with the Defense Information Systems Agency, the Defense Logistics Agency, Washington Headquarters Services, the Army and the Defense Health Agency being the top five buyers of commercial items. Among non-DoD agencies, 53 percent of the Homeland Security Department’s actions were commercial with the Coast Guard (48 percent) and the Transportation Security Administration (33 percent) as the top components. This is why federal acquisition experts are pushing for the Trump administration’s new OFPP administrator to make reducing regulations a top priority. Roger Waldron, the president of the Coalition for Government Procurement, wrote in February that the executive order opens the door wide to review procurement regulations. “Across the procurement landscape, there is no better opportunity to reduce regulatory costs in accordance with the EO than the General Services Administration’s portfolio of governmentwide contract vehicles, including the Multiple Award Schedule program,” Waldron wrote in his blog. “GSA has an opportunity to reduce regulatory costs, streamline processes, and increase access to the commercial marketplace. Immediately, GSA should engage in a wholesale review of its procurement processes, focusing on commercial item contracting, including the GSA Multiple Award Schedules program, to identify and eliminate costly and unnecessary government unique terms, conditions, policies, procedures, and requirements.” The Procurement Roundtable, a group of former federal acquisition experts, wrote a letter to President Donald Trump in January offering their recommendations on how to improve federal procurement. While leadership is among the most important factors, the experts say the 18,000-page FAR is just too cumbersome and daunting, particularly for firms new to the government market. The roundtable recommended the Trump administration conduct a review of all acquisition regulations and policies with a goal of reducing them and including sunset provisions in existing ones to force a periodical review. David Drabkin, a former GSA senior procurement executive, said the administration also could add a cost-benefit analysis to determine the costs to both contractors and agencies. He said that’s analysis particularly for agencies is rarely if ever done. The push coming from experts, associations and companies to reduce and reconsider many of these commercial regulations is more than just a coincidence and agencies should pay attention to this trend line and even get ahead of the curve.

MUKILTEO — Peter Zieve, the president of a major aerospace firm who led a campaign last year to try to prevent a mosque from being built in Mukilteo, says he wants to run for City Council. Zieve, 63, has launched his campaign with $50,000 of his own money, according to documents filed with the state’s Public Disclosure Commission. Zieve said it is a loan he made to the campaign. This is his first campaign for public office. Zieve is president and owner of Electroimpact Inc., a prominent maker of automated machines for jetliner assembly and counts the Boeing Co. as a major customer. Last year, he led opposition to plans for opening a mosque in the city, including an anonymous postcard sent to homes citywide. Zieve later apologized for his actions. His company also reached a $485,000 legal settlement with the state Attorney General’s Office agreeing, among other things, to adopt nondiscriminatory hiring policies and encourage more job applications from people of color. The court-monitored decree will be in place at Electroimpact for more than three years. Last year, Zieve gained a reputation for allowing a workplace culture where workers traded hateful jokes about Muslims via company-wide emails. He also was said to pressure single employees to marry and passed over job applicants who appeared to be Muslim. In an interview Tuesday, Zieve said last year’s postcard campaign alerting people to the planned Mukilteo mosque “was the wrong thing to do. “It doesn’t make any sense as far as my current way of thinking,” he said. Zieve said he’s not now opposing construction of the Islamic Center of Mukilteo and wishes backers good luck with the project. He said he has had a number of meetings with Mohammed Riaz Khan, the president of the group that wants to construct the mosque. Khan also plans to run for Mukilteo City Council. “We are negotiating a mutual endorsement,” Zieve said. On Wednesday, Khan said he did meet recently with Zieve at a coffee shop, but he is not endorsing him. “That’s not true,” Khan said. Zieve is welcome to endorse him if he wishes to do so, he added. Candidates can file to run for local offices beginning May 15. Zieve said he plans to run for Position 2 on the council, the seat now held by Bob Champion, council president. Zieve said there’s been no votes made by Champion that he disagrees with, calling the incumbent “a good guy” who will be hard to beat. Instead, he said he thinks that there’s not enough representation on the council by people who have children. “I have no idea if the voters think that’s important or not,” Zieve said. “We’ll find out.” Zieve’s home is in Harbour Pointe. He has three sons ages 11, 9, and 7 living with him. He said there are no playgrounds in the community, leading a lot of parents to ask why. The city decided to build the Rosehill Community Center, but “there’s nothing for kids,” he said. Zieve said the new Boys &Girls Club planned for the city will only have one gym. “We really need two,” to meet the city’s needs, he said. Zieve said he has contributed $200,000 to the project.

According to the US Air Force, the X-37B Orbital Test Vehicle is "the newest and most advanced re-entry spacecraft." This was the fourth flight of this vehicle. Boeing started the secret X-37B Orbital Test Vehicle project under NASA's aegis in 1999. Originally, the reusable X-37 was intended to repair satellites in orbit. However, in 2004 the program was classified and handed over to the US Air Force. Since 2010, the spacecraft are carrying out test orbital flights. According to experts, X-37 can be used both for testing new technologies and for the delivery of reconnaissance satellites into space. Potentially, they can be equipped with weapons, but the Pentagon assures that this is not part of its plans. The X-37B program is the newest and most advanced re-entry spacecraft that performs risk reduction, experimentation and concept of operations development for reusable space vehicle technologies. On March 20, 2015, a United Launch Alliance (ULA) Atlas V rocket successfully launched the AFSPC-5 satellite for the US Air Force from Space Launch Complex-41.

Hackers attempted to influence France's presidential election Hackers attempted - and failed - to influence the French presidential election in favour of far-right candidate Marine Le Pen of the Front National, with the release of nine gigabytes of email data stolen from new president and long-term frontrunner Emmanuel Macron's En Marche! party's data-driven campaign on Friday, just two days before polling opened (Gizmodo). The data dump, which appears to include a number of fake entries along with legitimate content, was credited to Emleaks, but is rumoured to be linked to the Russian hacking group known as APT-28 or Fancy Bear, which has reportedly been targeting the centre-left politician's campaign. It was promoted on Twitter by US 'alt-right' accounts and bots, as well as WikiLeaks. The French public was resoundingly unimpressed by the attempt to influence the vote, with Macron winning by 66.06 per cent to his extremist rival's 33.94 per cent in Sunday's final run-off.

Government considers targeted scrappage scheme in "weak" draft clean air plan The Department for Environment & Rural Affairs has published its Draft UK Air Quality Plan for tackling nitrogen dioxide following a court ruling that that the government had to go ahead with its planned publication despite the impending general election (BBC). The anti-pollution plan, which has been criticised as "half-baked" by environmental campaigners and "weak" by London Mayer Sadiq Khan, proposes measures including a scrappage scheme to take 15,000 older diesel and petrol cars off the road and an expansion of clean air zones in towns and cities that exceed safe levels of nitrogen dioxide, to be managed by local councils. Former energy and climate change secretary Ed Davey told the BBC: "This is not a plan, it's a cop out. Instead of bold commitments to improve air quality, the government is hiding behind yet another consultation and passing the buck to local authorities." 3. Facebook could start streaming 'TV-like' programmes in June Business Insider reports that Facebook plans to begin streaming "TV-like shows" in mid-June, according to "people familiar with the discussions" (Engadget). The sources indicated that the company will be focussing on making shows for teens, in the hope of capturing Snapchat's video audience. Facebook declined to comment on the report, but directed Engadget to older statements saying that the company is "funding some seed video content from our partners, and are evolving the initial Live deals to include other types of video content we'd like to experiment with". 4. Robotic space plane lands after 718 days in orbit On Sunday, May 7, Nasa successfully landed its X-37B robot space plane after a massive 718 days in orbit (Space.com). The mission, known as OTV-4 (Orbital Test Vehicle 4), saw the uncrewed plane take off on May 20, 2015, before spending almost two years in orbit as part of its test mission. The orbiter, which was the first vehicle to land at Nasa's Kenndy Space Center Shuttle Landing Facility since the USA retired its space shuttles, is one of two built by Boeing for the space agency, takes off vertically, lands horizontally and measures 8.8 metres in length. The US Air Force's Captain AnnMarie Annicelli told Space.com: "Technologies being tested in the program include advanced guidance, navigation and control; thermal-protection systems; avionics; high-temperature structures and seals; conformal, reusable insulation, lightweight electromechanical flight systems; and autonomous orbital flight, re-entry and landing."

Nike's two-hour marathon attempt misses the mark by just 25 seconds Eliud Kipchoge completed Nike's Breaking2 run on May 6 in Monza in 2:00:25 - the fastest time ever (WIRED). Although the attempt was agonisingly short of the coveted two hour margin, the result - which doesn't count as an official world record - will enter the history books. The performance by Kipchoge is two minutes faster than the 2:02:57 world record run at the Berlin Marathon in 2014. The three participating runners were supported by a team of 30 pacemakers, specially designed shoes and clothes from Nike, plus a team providing additional nutrition when needed. By using pacers and handing drinks to the runners, the attempt did not qualify as an official world record attempt under International Association of Athletics Federations regulations. "Today was 100 per cent," Kipchoge said in a press conference after the race. "I am happy to have reduced it by two and a half minutes".

Deer have for the first time been found eating human remains New findings published in the Journal of Forensic Sciences document the first known evidence of deer scavenging human bones (Popular Science). Motion-sensitive cameras set up at the Forensic Anthropology Research Facility (FARF) in San Marcos, Texas, captured two incidents of deer carrying human rib bones in January 2015, and the paper describes the characteristic traces left when the ungulates consume human remains. While this is the first time deer have been known to dine on humans, they're known to seek out animal remains, possibly to obtain vital minerals such as phosphorus, salt and calcium during the winter.

New maps show risks to the world's wine-making regions A new project, named WineRisk has mapped the different threats affecting wine-growing regions around the world, from climate change to economic factors (Science). The Australian-European project has assembled meteorologists, geophysicists, and economists to assemble a risk index for over 7000 wine producing areas around the globe. Collating all the factors, the team found that the countries most at risk are Argentina, Georgia and Moldova. 8. Review - Alien: Covenant With Alien: Covenant, returning director Ridley Scott attempts once more to answer questions about the franchise's about decades-old mysteries – but the result is a resounding, confusing failure (WIRED). The opening third of the movie is solid. As the Covenant takes damage from a stellar event early on, and with the crew awakening from cryosleep to deal with the disaster, the film feels like science fiction at its best, with Scott showing glimpses of his past mastery of the genre. It is not to last, as the remainder of the film descends into borderline farce. From the moment the crew set foot on the world, Covenant turns into Aliens-by-numbers, with a dash of inventive bio-horror thrown in. There are admittedly some good ideas here, but, these moments can't make up for the rest of the movie feeling like a redux or best-of collection of scenes from the other five core films. 9. The unreleased Nintendo PlayStation can now play CD-ROM games The only known surviving prototype of a never-released Nintendo PlayStation can finally play games on CD-ROM, thanks to the ongoing efforts of hacker Ben Heck (Ars Technica). In a new video Heck said: "I came in this morning and jiggled the cables around and got ready to work on it some more, and all of a sudden it works". He demonstrated it running homebrew game Magic Floor, although brawler Super Boss Gaiden failed to load, despite working in the no$sns emulator. Heck plans to return the prototype to Terry and Dan Diebold, who discovered it at an estate sale, next month at the Midwest Gaming Classic convention. 10. Watch footage from a cancelled Sonic the Hedgehog skateboarding game YouTube channel DidYouKnowGaming has revealed footage of Sonic Extreme, a never-released Sonic the Hedgehog skateboarding game - technically a hoverboard racing game - for XBox, Gamecube and PlayStation 2 (GameSpot). Unseen64, the gaming history archive behind the channel, has added some historical detail to the footage, which first surfaced in 2011 after being found on an XBox Dev Kit by a collector. It was developed in-house and without permission by Vision Scape, which had previously worked with Sega on cutscenes for Sonic Heroes. The company pitched its concept to Sega, with an initially positive response, but the Sonic rightsholder "went silent" after receiving a design document and budget estimate. Vision Scape's CEO reportedly believes that Sega's own Sonic Riders hoverboard racer was based on Sonic Extreme.

Picture by: AP/Press Association Images 7:44 8 May 2017 Newstalk 1 day ago An unmanned US military space plane has landed at NASA's Kennedy Space Center following a mission lasting more than two years. The X-37B, which looks like a miniature space shuttle, touched down on Sunday morning, causing a sonic boom as it landed on a runway once used for space shuttles which have been mothballed. Twitter users reacted to the sonic boom with one saying her house "shook" and her dog had "gone into a frenzy". Exactly what the space plane was doing during its 718 days in orbit is not entirely clear, with the US Air Force saying the orbiters "perform risk reduction, experimentation and concept-of-operations development for reusable space vehicle technologies". The cost of the mission - the fourth and longest so far - is classified. The Secure World Foundation, a non-profit group that promotes the peaceful exploration of space, says the secrecy surrounding the X-37B suggests intelligence-related hardware is being tested or evaluated aboard the craft. At 29 feet-long and with a wingspan of 15 feet, the Boeing-built craft is about a quarter of the size of NASA's now-retired space shuttles. This mission began in May 2015, when the plane set off from nearby Cape Canaveral Air Force Station aboard an Atlas 5 rocket built by United Launch Alliance, a partnership between Lockheed Martin Corp and Boeing Co. Its first mission was eight-months-long from April 2010, its second from March the following year lasted 15 months. A third took off in December 2012 and ended after 22 months. Another mission is scheduled later this year. According to the Orlando Sentinel, sonic booms used to be common in the area during the 30 years of NASA's manned space shuttle programme, with landings at the Kennedy Space Center preceded by a loud double boom. But the last of those shuttles landed nearly six years ago. There is also a type of rocket - SpaceX's Falcon 9 - which produces sonic booms and these were last heard earlier this month. But officials had refused to confirm the return date for the X-37B, so its arrival was not expected by residents. 7:44 8 May 2017 Newstalk 1 day ago 1 Related articles Mystery space plane lands at US air base after two-year mission most popular latest sport #PornWeek: The A to Z - by way of XXX - of pornography Here's how to renew your passport online Golden State Warriors advance after Utah sweep in NBA Playoffs Eugenie Bouchard defeats Sharapova in highly anticipated clash site terms privacy advertise with us contact competitions apps appliancesdelivered.ie © Copyright 2015 - Newstalk Ltd.

By MikeMurphy Editor A secretive unmanned U.S. Air Force “space plane” landed Sunday in Florida after a record-breaking time in orbit, waking up thousands of Floridians in the process. The X-37B Orbital Test Vehicle, which resembles a mini space shuttle, landed at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center around 8 a.m. Eastern, startling many on the ground as it sent a sonic boom across central Florida. Built by Boeing Co. BA, +0.55%  , the reusable, solar-powered X-37B was in orbit for almost two years — 718 days in all, breaking the endurance record set by a previous X-37B flight of 614 days. Overall, the program’s spacecraft have spent 2,085 days in orbit, according to the Air Force. “The landing of OTV-4 marks another success for the X-37B program and the nation,” said program manager Lt. Col.

The unmanned X-37B, which resembles a miniature space shuttle, touched down at 7:47 a.m. EDT (1147 GMT) on a runway formerly used for landings of the now-mothballed space shuttles, the Air Force said in an email. "The Boeing-built space plane blasted off in May 2015 from nearby Cape Canaveral Air Force Station aboard an Atlas 5 rocket built by United Launch Alliance, a partnership between Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N) and Boeing Co (BA.N)", it added. The X-37B, one of two in the Air Force fleet, conducted unspecified experiments for more than 700 days while in orbit. It was the fourth and lengthiest mission so far for the secretive program, managed by the Air Force Rapid Capabilities Office. //Petra//S Kh 8/5/2017 - 09:18:45 AM     Share |             Library   Facebook Google Plus Video Library Twitter You Tube       Our Services  Useful Links  Jordanian Embassies Weather   Currency Table                              Copyrights © 2017.

In Memoriam: J Michael Kenyon, Master of Mat History By STEVE JOHNSON - SLAM! Wrestling Tweet J Michael Kenyon If you combined Falstaff, Hemingway, and Gus the Wrestling Bear, you might just start to capture some of the essence of J Michael Kenyon. Just some of the essence, mind you, because they never drunkenly drove a car into San Diego's Mission Bay, changed their names to suit a woman, or spent hours sleuthing that it was Wayne Barnett, not Barrett, who wrestled at Turner Hall in Alton, Illinois, in January 1945. "He has led an existence heavy on the theatrical and at times the haphazard, often becoming a better story than the one he was writing," Seattle sportswriter Dan Raley quipped in a 2007 profile. So while Kenyon died May 3 at 73, his lifelong pursuit of wine, women, and wrestling ensures that he will remain as vivid in the afterlife as he was when he was swapping vasectomy stories with "Shag" Thomas, his first wrestling idol. As Dean Silverstone, his friend of more than half a century, wrote in I Ain't No Pig Farmer!: "To the average Joe who has not been involved in wrestling, Kenyon's life would appear extremely odd, but to an old carny such as myself, he's just a decent, normal, fun-loving friend." Living in Port Orford on the southern Oregon coast, Kenyon had not been well for years, suffering from congestive heart failure and a variety of other maladies. Health issues never deterred him from cranking out novella-length emails of obscure wrestlers and results, opining on the oddities of Civil War General Daniel Sickles, or making corrections to the record in his self-appointed role as the Wrestling Spelling Police. Even in death, he was hard to pin down. KIRO, a Seattle TV station, reported that he died April 26 at his home. That date was a surprise to his legion of friends who received an April 28 email from him about 1954 wresting results in Jackson, Tennessee. "We just exchanged emails last week. He warned me that the Wrestling Spelling Police may be paying me a visit over my Honolulu research," said Mark Hewitt, author of Catch Wrestling: A Wild and Wooly Look at the Early Days of Pro Wrestling in America. "J Michael was the keeper of the chronicles and could always be depended on for help." "I met him in 2013, through emails. We never spoke directly, but I considered him a great friend," said Mike Zim, son of "Wild" Bill Zim. "He was the one who inspired me to research dad's wrestling history. That quickly reached into all kinds of topics, since he was such a Renaissance man. Baseball, basketball, movies, history, politics, newspapering, radio, thunder boats, horse racing." The Seattle Mariners expressed their condolences to Kenyon, who covered the team from its inaugural season in 1977 through 1981. "He was a colorful personality, who had a photographic memory and loved baseball, professional wrestling, golf and the game of croquette and the game of life," the team's publicity department said in a statement May 7. "Now that he is gone, who do I discuss some forgotten undercard wrestler of the 1930s that no one else where heard of? We were always asking each other about various ring names. Could this guy be this wrestler?" said Don Luce, whom Kenyon considered a wrestling researcher without peer. "Now that he is gone, there is no one else to replace his knowledge of wrestling, sports, and various other topics." The Budding Author Michael Eugene Glover was born July 9, 1943 in Seattle, the son of a postal carrier who loved the ponies. He described his father Lester as "painfully shy." When colleagues gave the senior Glover a going-away present following a half-century of selling pari-mutuel tickets at the Longacres Race Track in Seattle, all he could say was, "Gee, this is swell." His son had no such inhibitions. He was well into his literary career as a teenager, selling ads for the Roosevelt High School yearbook in Seattle, poring over newspapers at which he'd eventually work, and writing fan letters to sportswriter W.C. "Bill" Heinz, author of The Professional, a boxing novel. "The way I remember it, I read The Professional when it came out in January 1958, and for the first time in my life wrote to the author to tell him how much I liked his book," Kenyon recalled. "I must have taken months to work up the nerve, because the reply from Bill Heinz, which came within a few days, was dated October 11, 1958, my birthday." Though he was only 16, Kenyon had been tinkering with writing westerns, and the lessons Heinz imparted about character development influenced everything he did from then on. Characters, Heinz explained, must be permitted to think for themselves, each with his own manner of speech and level of thought. The writer should not tell, but show. "You cannot imagine how important it was for me to learn these unwritten rules of writing. I had been writing fiction, Westerns, for only the past seven years. I knew I didn't want to write in the classic style of the omniscient author. I didn't have the voice for it, the language. Studying Hemingway, I felt I was getting close to the style I wanted to develop. I began reading The Professional and there it was on every page," Kenyon recalled. At the same time he was learning to write, Kenyon was falling under the spell of Henry Elliott's Seattle wrestling promotionin typical Kenyonesque prose, he said he found himself "gobsmacked" by the wondrous world of pro wrestling. In particular, he was captivated with James "Shag" Thomas, the short, squat ex-Ohio State football player who was touring the Northwest because opportunities for black wrestlers were too few and far between. In 1960, at about the time Thomas was executing a turn from heel to hero in a feud with Tony Borne, Kenyon summoned the courage to approach the wrestler and ask permission to run a fan club. "'No,' he said, sizing me up (as I had reached my full height of six-foot-four, that meant his head was tilted up at a rather severe angle), and laughing about the Mutt and Jeff aspect of our heights. Almost instantly, we seemed to connect on some level ... he asked about me, about where I lived, went to school, how long I'd been a wrestling fan, etc. ... and before I knew it, he'd agreed to let me launch a fan club in his honor," Kenyon said. Outside of relatives, Thomas was the first adult who befriended Kenyon, and he became a confidant of sorts for the 17-year-old boy. "Shag was such an influence on me! Even to the point, I must admit, that I followed his lead ... albeit years later ... when I got a vasectomy. I'll never forget the night I huddled with him prior to a show in Seattle's Eagles Auditorium (must have been sometime late in the fall of 1961) and, when I asked him why he seemed to be walking a little more slowly than usual, he explained, in some detail, the surgical procedure he had undergone that very afternoon. And, with a shrug, he went right into the ring and participated in a slam-bang, 30-minute wrestling match. 'Can't afford not to work,' he said, with the friendly smile he always seemed to have for me." Paul Diamond, and J Michael Kenyon with his wife Joan at a Cauliflower Alley Club reunion. Photo by Rose Diamond New Lines of Work For two dollars, Kenyon -- still lanky Mike Glover at the time -- turned over the reins of the Thomas fan club to Silverstone, three years his junior, as he went into the Army in Texas. Upon exiting, the father of his first wife Trudi -- a serial groom, Kenyon would have five brides -- tried to entice him into a lucrative screw machine products business that claimed aerospace giant Boeing as one of its clients. It wasn't in character for Kenyon. "When confronted with the choice of standing in front of a lathe or sitting in front of a typewriter propped up at the end of the nearest saloon bar, I opted for the latter," Kenyon said. He would work for Washington newspapers in Yakima, Tacoma, and Seattle, among others, By his own count, he was fired and rehired four times between 1965 and 1980 at the Post-Intelligencer, where his beat at the ripe old age of 23 included the first year of the NBA Seattle Supersonics in 1967-68. But wrestling was never far from his mind. In 1966, he and Silverstone hooked up to form Western State Wrestling, a promotion that would run Port Angeles, Washington, every other Thursday night. On the afternoon of the third show, in October, Silverstone swung by Kenyon's house. His business partner sheepishly walked out, still in his pajamas. "My wife won't let me go. We haven't made any money and she doesn't think we will." How could such a marriage last? Answer: it couldn't. Kenyon became smitten with Lee Franke, a woman he met at a Seattle pub, quit the Seattle paper for one in Baltimore, and changed his identity to get married in June 1968. He spotted the Kenyon Printing Co. when he was driving through Lynnwood, Washington, and thought it would be a dandy last name. He put a "J" in front -- no period -- and declared himself to be J Michael Kenyon. Bill McFarland handled the legal aspects of the name change; he was a 315-goal scorer in the old Western Hockey League and one-time president of the World Hockey Association. "His nickname was 'Packy' and that's what I called him when he played and when I handed over his fee, one U.S. Grant ($50), on the day a Superior Court judge in Seattle said, 'Have a nice life, Mister Kenyon.' " Perhaps not coincidentally, Kenyon nee Glover left his love of hockey behind with his name change. Once a front-row customer of the Seattle Ironmen and Americans in the 1950s, he soured on the sport when players started wearing helmets. "When I followed the game, the only guys who wore hats were the ones who already had metal screws fitted into their brain sacs," he fumed. Loving Instability The marriage to Lee didn't last long, and Kenyon was disappointed to find the Baltimore Evening Sun's narrow columns rendered his byline as "Mike Kenyon." By 1970, he had morphed into a boxing entrepreneur in Ohio, with Dean Chance, a former Cy Young Award winner known as one of baseball's freest spirits. Then with the Cleveland Indians, Chance hired Kenyon as matchmaker and publicity guru for his budding boxing business. The idea was to create a year-long, $250,000 program that would produce boxing shows in Canton, Akron, and Youngstown. "I'm amazed at the reception we've received in the area," Kenyon told the Akron Beacon-Journal. "Ninety-five percent of the people we've talked to are tremendously enthused about our plans and many are non-boxing people." The gig spanned two months before the peripatetic Kenyon was on the road again, reviewing films for the Hollywood Reporter. At various points in his career, he'd promote horse racing, croquet, basketball, rodeo shows, and serve as spokesman for the United Hydroplane Racing Association. Some ventures ended badly; others ended even worse. As an editor at a California newspaper during the height of Watergate, he was canned for running a front-page picture of President Richard Nixon with the cutline: "Would you buy a used car from him now?" Yet all roads led back to Seattle, and when the Mariners entered the American League as a not-very-good expansion team in 1977, Kenyon was back at the Post-Intelligencer as their beat writer. The reason was simple: the man could write. All those lessons from Heinz and Hemingway stuck with him even during his excursions into risky businesses. In his daily stories, there was no dry recitation of facts and figures. He always approached his subject sideways, as in his lead to a 1978 piece about a Minnesota Twins-Mariners game: "Within Gene Mauch's right shoe, sans tongue and laces, an inflamed foot nearly as uncontrolled as his pitchers were last night. In the clubhouse, Mauch didn't know which ached more -- the foot or the 13-6 loss to the Seattle Mariners. In the air-conditioned Kingdome palace, there was nothing cool about the bats of either team.  There was nothing cool about Mauch's right foot, either." "The P-I sports department in those days was a Jack Nicholson short of One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest," wrote Seattle journalist Art Thiel. "I'll never forget the informal competition between two of my writer heroes, J Michael Kenyon and Blaine Johnson. Known as 'One for the Thumb,' they raced to see who could be the first to a fifth marriage." Kenyon was one of the earliest sportswriters to branch into radio, hosting shows on KING and KVI in Seattle. At KING, he walked out in the middle of his show to protest a station manager's interference. At KVI, which he joined in 1980, he planned to drop a marshmallow 280 feet from the top of the Kingdome in recognition of New York Yankee manager Billy Martin's fistfight with a marshmallow salesman. American League President Lee McPhail vetoed the gimmick. When Woody Hayes was in Seattle for a clinic, Kenyon called in to the ex-Ohio State football coach to ask about a punching incident at the Gator Bowl that led to his dismissal. Hayes cursed and hung up on Kenyon. "I personally believe the world of wrestling created his personality because, in real life, he acted like a heel worker," Silverstone said. "If someone didn't like what he did, he'd say 'Screw you,' and he'd move on." In fact, Kenyon aid one of his few regrets was choosing radio over newspaper work, instead of trying to find a way to accommodate both. "If I had to do it all over again, I'd argue harder to have the P-I let me do the newspaper and radio thing," Kenyon told Raley in the 2007 profile. "I'd probably still be there."

Photo by Wayne McCarty The Dean of Wrestling History Whatever his game, or his dame, for that matter, Kenyon always kept on top of wrestling history, poring over old newspapers and microfilms for clues to the business that so entranced him as a kid. He collected his musings, scribblings, and notes in "Wrestling As We Liked It," aka the WAWLI papers, probably the single largest arcana collection of its kind. A typical rambling issue included clippings on a 1935 bans on soda bottles at wrestling events in Norfolk, Virginia, and aged results from Bridgeton, New Jersey, and Holyoke, Massachusetts. The carnival aspect of wrestling-- midgets, sideshows, and bears -- was a particular point of pleasure with Kenyon. For years, his "Sunday Punches" column on the Cauliflower Alley Club website was the go-to place for memories of days gone by, since he didn't have much use for wrestling post-1965. "Boy, what I would give to have one more crack at watching the likes of Nomellini, Kiniski, the Torres brothers, Barend and Dubuque, Steve Stanlee, Bob Orton, Bobo Brazil and Lord Blears -- all on one show, at a delightful old venue like the [San Francisco] Winterland, the converted ice skating rink at the corner of Post and Steiner," he lamented. Still, he updated CAC members on current topics such as Vince McMahon's TV shows and the latest from wrestling journalist Dave Meltzer, who turned a lot of Kenyon's research into mainstream articles. "At one point around 1974, he asked me if we could do a newsletter together because his regular sports work made covering wrestling as detailed as he would like difficult," Meltzer wrote upon Kenyon's death. "As it turned out, he lost interest in furthering that within a few months, and would disappear and return to covering wrestling over the years.  Because of his background in promoting events, he had a combination of insider knowledge, trivial and historical knowledge of pro wrestling, and an understanding of the business as it was like nobody of his era." Kenyon had a hand in record books chronicling Gorgeous George, Jim Londos, Sandor Szabo, and others, and posted on wrestling message boards under the moniker "Old Fall Guy," a tip of the hat to Marcus Griffin's 1938 wrestling expose, The Fall Guys. But his most valuable contribution came in digital reams of behind-the-scenes correspondence, from a monograph on a wrestling swindle in 1919 to his talks with Myrtle Casey, the sister-in-law of former world champion Steve "Crusher" Casey. His resources informed every wrestling history book written in the last two decades. "Bloody" Buddy O'Brien was initially an afterthought in our book, The Pro Wrestling Hall of Fame: The Heels. By the time we tapped Kenyon's reservoir of research, O'Brien was a featured section, and his family learned details about him they never knew. In 2010, when he received the James Melby Award from the National Wresting Hall of Fame/Dan Gable Museum, Kenyon took a stab at explaining the history of wrestling research, taking care to credit his longtime allies in minutiae such as Tom Burke, Don Luce, Burt Ray, Steve Yohe, Mark Hewitt, and the late Fred Hornby. "Like movie stars, lots of grapplers used made-up names to begin with -- and then, to shroud the fact they were on losing streaks ("jobbers" in the parlance of the trade), they continued to change their names. My particular passion, for 55 years, has been trying to straighten out all those monikers." In recent years, Kenyon and Joan were pretty much confined to their home in Port Orford. They got an occasional visit from Al Bianchi, a friend of 50 years who coached the inaugural edition of the Supersonics. He was working with Kenyon on a book about the changing nature of basketball. "Along the way, I'll be attempting to correct as many of the errors made by other pro cage historians whose research, here and there, proved a little faulty," Kenyon said, who also may have been the world's leading authority on the history of the Harlem Globetrotters. Otherwise, the Kenyons were pretty much limited to the post office, the grocery store, and the library. "Funny about being a 'shut-in,'" he said. "When Harry Elliott cranked up what would become the halcyon years of Seattle wrestling promotion in 1959, his spiel to the TV audience at the top of the weekly (live) program on would always include a big hello and howdy to 'those shut-ins at home across the Pacific Northwest.' "Now, 53 years later, I'm just about a fully qualified member of the clan ... But, as the Brits forever are reminding us: 'musn't grumble.' And it's true: I haven't got the slightest kick in the world coming ... I've had enough fun and good times for 10 lifetimes."

By MikeMurphy Editor A secretive unmanned U.S. Air Force “space plane” landed Sunday in Florida after a record-breaking time in orbit, waking up thousands of Floridians in the process. The X-37B Orbital Test Vehicle, which resembles a mini space shuttle, landed at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center around 8 a.m. Eastern, startling many on the ground as it sent a sonic boom across central Florida. Built by Boeing Co. BA, +0.55%  , the reusable, solar-powered X-37B was in orbit for almost two years — 718 days in all, breaking the endurance record set by a previous X-37B flight of 614 days. Overall, the program’s spacecraft have spent 2,085 days in orbit, according to the Air Force. “The landing of OTV-4 marks another success for the X-37B program and the nation,” said program manager Lt. Col.

The X-37B, which looks like a miniature space shuttle, touched down on Sunday morning, causing a sonic boom as it landed on a runway once used for space shuttles which have been mothballed. Twitter users reacted to the sonic boom with one saying her house "shook" and her dog had "gone into a frenzy". Exactly what the space plane was doing during its 718 days in orbit is not entirely clear, with the US Air Force saying the orbiters "perform risk reduction, experimentation and concept-of-operations development for reusable space vehicle technologies". The cost of the mission - the fourth and longest so far - is classified. The Secure World Foundation, a non-profit group that promotes the peaceful exploration of space, says the secrecy surrounding the X-37B suggests intelligence-related hardware is being tested or evaluated aboard the craft. At 29 feet long and with a wingspan of 15 feet, the Boeing-built craft is about a quarter of the size of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's now-retired space shuttles. The #AirForce #X37B #OTV4 is back after more than 700 days in #Space. @NASAKennedy pic.twitter.com/02WdzMSDJe— U.S. Air Force (@usairforce) May 7, 2017 This mission began in May 2015, when the plane set off from nearby Cape Canaveral Air Force Station aboard an Atlas 5 rocket built by United Launch Alliance, a partnership between Lockheed Martin Corp and Boeing Co. Its first mission began in April 2010 and was eight months long, its second from March the following year lasted 15 months. A third took off in December 2012 and ended after 22 months. Another mission is scheduled later this year. According to the Orlando Sentinel, sonic booms used to be common in the area during the 30 years of NASA's manned space shuttle programme, with landings at the Kennedy Space Center preceded by a loud double boom. But the last of those shuttles landed nearly six years ago. There is also a type of rocket - SpaceX's Falcon 9 - which produces sonic booms and these were last heard earlier this month. But officials had refused to confirm the return date for the X-37B, so its arrival was not expected by residents.

China joins the jet age with homegrown passenger plane The "C" in the aircraft's name stands for both China and COMAC, while 9 symbolizes "forever" in Chinese culture, and 19 represents the 190 seats at maximum capacity. FAMAGUSTA GAZETTE CYPRUS� China's homegrown large passenger plane, the C919, took to the sky on last week, making China the fourth jumbo jet producer after the United States, West Europe and Russia. It also marks a milestone for the Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC), the Shanghai-based manufacturer of the C919. The twin-engine plane departed from Shanghai Pudong International Airport on Friday with five crew members on board but no passengers. The 80-minute flight was greeted with applause by more than 1,000 spectators on the tarmac, including Vice Premier Ma Kai and Shanghai Party chief Han Zheng. The "C" in the aircraft's name stands for both China and COMAC, while 9 symbolizes "forever" in Chinese culture, and 19 represents the 190 seats at maximum capacity. "The maiden flight was exciting," said Wu Guanghui, C919's chief designer, adding that it was a major breakthrough in China's civil aviation history, as well as the start of a new era of advanced manufacturing in the country. With a standard range of 4,075 kilometers, the narrow-body jet is comparable with updated Airbus 320 and Boeing's new generation 737, signaling the country's entry into the global aviation market. China began to develop its own jumbo passenger jets in the 1970s and the first one, the Y-10, had a successful test flight in 1980. But the project was abandoned later. In 2007, the State Council approved plans to develop a large passenger jet. In November 2015, the first C919 jet rolled off the assembly line. The aircraft was given the go-ahead in April to begin a series of high-speed taxiing tests, the final step before its maiden flight. More than 200,000 technicians worked on the project. The jet was designed and produced in China and made with resources from around the world. It is an achievement in global cooperation, said Wu. The C919 incorporates parts from over 30 global suppliers such as Honeywell International Inc. Its engines were made by a joint venture between General Electric and Safran Aircraft Engines. � � FAMAGUSTA GAZETTE CYPRUS Sitemap { powered by bulletlink.com }

The reusable, unmanned X-37B Orbital Test Vehicle landed at the Shuttle Landing Facility at NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida, an airport used by the U.S. space agency's Space Shuttle for landing until the program's end in 2011. The just-ended mission, known as Orbital Test Vehicle mission 4 (OTV-4), was launched in May 2015 and conducted secret experiments for a total of 718 days while in orbit. It's the fourth and longest-running mission for the X-37B program, run by the U.S. Air Force's Rapid Capabilities Office. The program began as a NASA project in 1999 but was later transferred to the Pentagon. The first three missions all ended with landings at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. The X-37B, built by Boeing, looks much like NASA's retired space shuttles, only much smaller. It is boosted into orbit by a rocket and lands like an aircraft on a conventional runway. The exact purpose of the X-37B was never revealed and the secrecy surrounding the project has led to speculation that the solar-powered X-37B can be used as a spy satellite or to deliver weapons from space.   【1】【2】【3】【4】 (For the latest China news, Please follow People's Daily on Twitter and Facebook) (Web editor: Hu Ximeng, Hongyu) Add your comment Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

Washington state legislature Add State Senator Bob Hasegawa to the growing list of people running for mayor of Seattle as Ed Murray faces allegations of sexual abuse and mulls ending his re-election bid. Hasegawa—whose legislative district includes Sodo, Georgetown, and South Park—is a former UPS driver and union official and the son of Japanese-American parents who were incarcerated during World War II, according to his campaign. In a statement, the campaign said he believes his experience "makes him the strongest candidate to stand toe-to-toe against an increasingly hostile federal government." Hasegawa will make a municipal bank "the lynchpin for his economic justice agenda." Known as a nonconformist Democrat, Hasegawa has pushed for a state bank and complained about Sound Transit. In 2013, he was one of only two state senators who voted against $8.7 billion in tax breaks for Boeing. Last year, he was a delegate for Bernie Sanders. During the Democratic National Convention, Hasegawa wrote that he was witnessing “the most significant shift to the right of our Democratic Party since the 1990s," the Seattle Times reported. The South Seattle Emerald first reported on Hasegawa's campaign this afternoon. He plans to speak at Wells Fargo Center tomorrow at 11 am, joined by supporters. 10 You might also be interested in these: Sponsored: Tutus, Pointe Shoes…And Hairy Chests.

A pioneering spacecraft belonging to the United States military has landed in Florida after completing a secret two-year mission circling the Earth. The experimental X-37B space plane produced a sonic boom that surprised residents along the Florida coastline as it prepared to touch down at the Shuttle Landing Facility at Nasa's Kennedy Space Centre. At 718 days, the mission broke records for being the lengthiest conducted by the Air Force. The X-37B is one of two unmanned planes conducting such orbits. The secrecy around the project has prompted much speculation, with some observers suggesting that the craft is some sort of space weapon. But the Air Force has always denied this notion, insisting that it is testing technologies for future spacecraft travel. The orbiters "perform risk reduction, experimentation and concept-of-operations development for reusable space vehicle technologies," the Air Force has said. The Secure World Foundation, a nonprofit group promoting the peaceful exploration of space, said the secrecy surrounding the X-37B suggests the presence of intelligence-related hardware being tested or evaluated aboard the craft. The Air Force has refused to reveal the cost of the programme. The office of the secretary of the Air Force heralded the landing of the X-37B plane yesterday as proof a major advancement in the project. "The landing of OTV-4 marks another success for the X-37B programme and the nation," said Ron Fehlen, a lieutenant colonel and X-37B programme manager. Continued below. Related Content Woman dies after overnight shooting in Invercargill Your Views: Readers' Letters Fran O'Sullivan: Brownlee understands the Trump talk "This mission once again set an on-orbit endurance record and marks the vehicle's first landing in the state of Florida. "We are incredibly pleased with the performance of the space vehicle and are excited about the data gathered to support the scientific and space communities." The vehicles resemble a miniature version of Nasa's now retired space shuttles. The original Space Shuttle system had carried up to eight astronauts into low Earth Orbit. The shuttle would re-enter the Earth's atmosphere upon completing its mission and land like a glider. It was not without its dangers: in the course of 135 missions flown, two orbiters were destroyed, killing 14 astronauts. These new aircraft are 8.8m long and have a wingspan of 4.5m, making them about one quarter of the size of the original shuttles. Like the space shuttle, the X-37B lands on a runway, plane-style, but does so autonomously. X-37B space plane returns after two-year secret mission https://t.co/0A4E84MdD7— BBC News (World) (@BBCWorld) May 8, 2017 A fact sheet for the vehicle states that the space plane is designed to spend up to 270 days in orbit at a time. But so far several of the missions have much exceeded that limit. Also known as the Orbital Test Vehicle, or OTV, it first flew in April 2010 and stayed aloft for 225 days. A second mission launched in March 2011 and lasted 15 months, while a third flight took off in December 2012 and returned after 22 months. The Boeing-built space plane blasted off for this mission in May 2015 from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station aboard an Atlas 5 rocket built by United Launch Alliance, a partnership between Lockheed Martin Corp and Boeing Company. Experts have suggested that engineers testing technologies for future satellites want to see how well these materials survive in space environment for long periods of time. The Air Force intends to launch the fifth X-37B mission from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, located just south of the Kennedy Space Centre, later this year. - Daily Telegraph UK By Ruth Sherlock Email Print Get the news delivered straight to your inbox Receive the day’s news, sport and entertainment in our daily email newsletter SIGN UP NOW Loading Discover more Loading Loading Herald Services Book your ad Driven Photos for sale True Commercial Death Notices Public Notices Our Regional News Stories The Northern Advocate Tua helps NZ U20s to Oceania glory Northlander Tamati Tua played a hand in NZ U20's win over Australia.

My first day on the job was at our sister facility in Norway, so it was a pretty wild experience. So I got to train there for four months, and just around Thanksgiving I came back, met family in Maryland, and then relocated to Plattsburgh," Schmidt said. Norsk Titanium builds airplane parts with 3-D printing using titanium -- the first approved by the FAA and what the company says is a more efficient process.  Norsk plans to hire hundreds of new employees in the next few years. "It depends on what your skill set is," said Ron Cotto, a Senior Operator with the company. "If we're hiring for operators then we'll look at people with a technical background -- machining, CNC, electrical, hydraulics."  Though titanium is seen as a high-quality product, it's often viewed as too expensive. But Norsk officials say their 3-D printing method can cut the costs of typical production by 25 to 30-percent. "Well in aerospace, in general, they buy 15 pounds of titanium for every pound of titanium they use in an airplane, and what we're gonna do is we're gonna have them buy three pounds of titanium for every pound in an airplane," said Chet Fuller, Norsk's Chief Commercial Officer. Just last month Norsk announced that the Boeing 747 Dreamliner would be the first commercial airline to use their additive manufactured titanium parts. Within the past few weeks Norsk has brought in two new printing machines to Plattsburgh, and they plan to bring 19 more to kick off their full scale production facility.  "Right now it's dependent on some certification activities. It will be happening over the summer, but we hope by third or fourth quarter to fully transition the Boeing production to the U.S., and Norway at that time will remain a technology center, where we work on the process and the machines," said Rebecca McGrane, Vice President & General Manager of Technology Center. Norsk is leasing two buildings in Plattsburgh for their operations, but they hope to eventually build a technology center at the former Clinton County Airport. "We're looking at some finalized plans for that facility this week with New York, so I would be hopeful that ground breaking would still be before the fall, so that construction could begin," said Warren Boley, Norsk's CEO. Boley says they hope to hire as many as 150 employees by the end of the year, depending on demand for their products.      Local NewsMore>> Truck driver smashed into tree in Fairfax Truck driver smashed into tree in Fairfax Updated: Tuesday, May 9 2017 12:58 AM EDT2017-05-09 04:58:48 GMT A truck driver tells police he was having break problems before crashing in Fairfax Monday afternoon.

It's hard to see how this makes sense, unless Trump is trying to strangle this New Deal-era agency, which Garrett tried to do in 2015 - labeling it "corporate welfare" and "the epitome of crony capitalism" shortly before voters from New Jersey's Fifth District tired of his hard-right zealotry and sent the seven-term congressman packing. This attempt to resurrect his career in public service will be greeted with the same level of approbation: The Ex-Im Bank subsidizes small and medium-sized American businesses to sell their products in global markets, allowing them to increase exports, create jobs, and grow the economy. It has had a long history of bipartisan support, but has become a fat target for Freedom Caucus types such as Garrett. That doesn't mean there haven't been dubious subsidies. But when there is legitimate Congressional oversight, and the bank serves small businesses rather than multinational corporations such as Boeing, Ex-Im is invaluable. Garrett's Gambit: Lying his way into Wall Street's favor | Editorial It provided financing for $27.5 billion in exports in fiscal 2014, and that supported 164,000 American jobs. The taxpayer was the beneficiary: Ex-Im returned $674.7 million to the U.S. Treasury that year. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce calls it "one of the most important tools at the disposal of U.S. companies to increase exports and create jobs." Trump isn't likely to be as charitable, which is probably why he nominated Garrett, but the president has flipped in his assessment of the Ex-Im Bank in the past year. He should consult New Jerseyans, who made up their minds about Garrett months ago.

Jarlstrom and the Institute for Justice argue the laws violate the First Amendment. (Photo: Institute for Justice) Mats Jarlstrom’s trouble all began with a red-light camera. In April 2013, Jarlstrom’s wife, Laurie, received a ticket after driving her Volkswagen through an intersection in Beaverton, Oregon, that was equipped with a traffic camera. His wife paid the fine, but the timing of the traffic lights at the intersection piqued Jarlstrom’s interest, so he decided to look into a formula created in 1959 to calculate the length of yellow lights. Jarlstrom says he realized the original formula failed to take into account the extra time it takes for a car to slow before making a right-hand turn safely. “Currently, people are getting tickets for running red lights because they’re slowing down when they’re making turns,” he tells The Daily Signal “It’s a safety issue because any time we run a red light, we’re in the intersection for the wrong reason, and there is cross traffic, and especially pedestrians are in danger.” Jarlstrom, an electronics engineer from Sweden, revised the formula to take the deceleration into account, and decided to take his findings public. But doing so, he quickly learned, came with a risk, and a costly one at that. Jarlstrom shared his findings with local media, policymakers, the sheriff, and Alexei Maradudin, who helped craft the original mathematical formula in 1959. He also emailed his theory to the Oregon State Board of Examiners for Engineering and Land Surveying, in hopes it would take a look at his research. The Oregon panel said it didn’t have any jurisdiction over traffic lights. But it did have jurisdiction over the state’s engineering laws. And it decided to open an investigation into Jarlstrom because of “his use of the title ‘electronics engineer’ and the statement ‘I’m an engineer,’” according to an order from the board. After investigating Jarlstrom for two years, the board fined him $500. The reason? Jarlstrom, according to the board, practiced engineering without a license each time he “critiqued” the traffic-light system and identified himself as an engineer in correspondence with the panel. “You don’t need to be an engineer to understand this,” Jarlstrom says in an interview with The Daily Signal, adding: I read something that was already public and understood it, and I wanted to share that information with the public talking about it. I felt completely shocked when I contacted them that they weren’t interested in listening to the problems that I presented to the board. They accused me of being illegal by saying I was a Swedish electronics engineer. Jarlstrom paid the $500 fine, and the board closed its investigation. But now, the public-interest law firm Institute for Justice is fighting alongside the Oregon man in federal court to challenge the state’s engineering laws. “The issues are classic First Amendment issues,” Sam Gedge, an Institute for Justice lawyer who is representing Jarlstrom, tells The Daily Signal. “The government can’t punish people for expressing their concerns. The government can’t take words and redefine them and then punish people for using them in a way the government doesn’t like.” ‘Unusual’ Jarlstrom does have education and experience in engineering. He has a degree in electronics engineering from Sweden, which is the equivalent of a bachelor’s degree in engineering in the United States. Jarlstrom, 56, also worked for Luxor Electronics before immigrating to the United States in 1992. But in Oregon, anyone who engages in “creative work requiring engineering education, training, and experience” under the state Professional Engineer Registration Act is required to be licensed as a professional engineer. Nearly every state requires professional engineers to have a license. However, those licenses typically are reserved for engineers who build skyscrapers or design electrical plans for buildings. The Institute for Justice is challenging the vague definition of what constitutes a professional engineer in Oregon, which in effect allows the board to regulate the exchange of ideas and of the word “engineer,” Gedge says: What makes Oregon so unusual is they’ve taken the licensing regime for professional engineers and are applying it to people like Mats, who are talking about issues that concern them. That’s unusual. There are two issues for Jarlstrom, Gedge says: He used the word “engineer” to describe himself, and he talked about technical topics. “There have been a number of instances about the board going after people simply because they used the word engineer to describe themselves,” the lawyer says. “There are also examples of the board going after people who have never used the word engineer to describe themselves, but are nonetheless going out in public and speaking about technical topics.” “That word isn’t off-limits to people,” he says. “The laws can’t be used to stop people from sending an email to his sheriff for safety.” Other Incidents Indeed, Jarlstrom’s experiences with Oregon’s Board of Examiners for Engineering and Land Surveying aren’t exclusive to him. Last year, the board opened an investigation into Allen Alley, a Republican gubernatorial candidate, who stated in campaign ads: “I’m an engineer and a problem solver.” Alley received a bachelor of science in mechanical engineering from Purdue University and worked as an engineer for Ford and Boeing. But he isn’t a licensed professional engineer in Oregon. The board’s investigation into Alley is ongoing. In another instance, the panel investigated a woman profiled in Portland Monthly’s “Oregon Woman 2015” edition. Included in the magazine was an article about Marcela Alcantar and a headline about “the incredible story of the engineer behind Portland’s newest bridge.” The board opened a “law enforcement case” against Alcantar based on the line, since she wasn’t a registered professional engineer. Ultimately, the case was closed after the board’s staff spoke with the journalist who wrote the article. The board determined “engineer” was a designation given not by Alcantar, but by the article’s editors. “The definition of the practice of engineering is so broad according to the board, and the board has shown itself to be so aggressive,” Gedge says. “Expressing your concerns on technical topics certainly leaves you at the risk of being investigated.” ‘Whistleblower’ Although Jarlstrom ultimately paid the fine, he says he believes the board’s decision violated his freedom of expression. And while he does have engineering experience, Jarlstrom contends the skills he used to craft his revised formula relied on 6th- and 7th-grade math: It’s interesting that just because students here in Beaverton or elsewhere are using math and looking at some traffic-flow issues in school, they would be considered practicing engineering according to the board. We can’t have laws having that kind of power or overreach. Jarlstrom says he considers himself a whistleblower and is surprised something like this could happen in the United States. But he vows to continue working to “improve our civil rights and freedom of speech so individuals like myself can share ideas, whether they’re good or bad.” “We still need to be able to express them,” he says. “If we can’t, there won’t be any ideas to choose from.” The Daily Signal depends on the support of readers like you.

On Sunday (May 7), the U.S. Air Force's robotic X-37B space plane landed at NASA's Kennedy Space Center (KSC) in Florida, wrapping up a mission that lasted an unprecedented 718 days. As the X-37B zoomed down the tarmac at KSC's Shuttle Landing Facility (SLF), it cruised past what appeared to be a NASA space shuttle. The juxtaposition was jarring for several reasons. First, the pairing shows just how small the X-37B is; it looks a toy next to the giant shuttle. (Indeed, two X-37B vehicles could fit inside the space shuttle's payload bay.) [The X-37B's Fourth Mystery Mission in Photos] The U.S. Air Force's X-37B space plane (right, on runway) approaches Inspiration, a full-size space shuttle mockup, shortly after touching down at Kennedy Space Center's Shuttle Landing Facility on May 7, 2017. Credit: U.S. Air Force And why is a space shuttle parked outside at the SLF? NASA's shuttle program ended in July 2011, and all three surviving space-flown orbiters are on display in museums around the country. Endeavour is on display at the California Science Center in Los Angeles, Discovery is at the National Air and Space Museum in the Washington, D.C., area and Atlantis is at the KSC Visitor Complex (located inside in a dazzling museum display). The shuttle out on the SLF, it turns out, is a full-size, wood-and-plastic model called Inspiration. It was originally built in 1972 by Rockwell International (then known as North American Rockwell), to support the company's ultimately successful bid to build the real orbiters for NASA.

Credit: U.S. Air Force For more than 20 years, Inspiration had been parked outside the U.S. Astronaut Hall of Fame in Titusville, Florida, just west of KSC. But in January 2016, the mockup's new owners, LVX System, moved it to a nearby work yard. Then, in April of that year, Inspiration was rolled out to the SLF, where workers continue to refurbish the vehicle. Eventually, Inspiration will travel by barge along America's waterways, allowing people around the country to see a full-size space shuttle (or a model of one, at least), LVX System representatives have said.   The mockup space shuttle Inspiration was rolled past the Vehicle Assembly Building on its way to the Shuttle Landing Facility at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center on April 27, 2016. Credit: LVX System The Air Force is known to possess two X-37B vehicles, each of which was built by Boeing. The 29-foot-long (8.8 meters) space planes launch vertically and land horizontally, just like the space shuttle used to do. These two X-37Bs have flown a total of four Earth-orbiting missions, each of which has been longer than its predecessors. The first flight, known as OTV-1 (short for Orbital Test Vehicle-1), launched in April 2010 and lasted 224 days. OTV-2 began in March 2011 and stayed aloft for 468 days; OTV-3 lifted off in December 2012 and touched down 674 days later. OTV-4, the just-ended mission, launched on May 20, 2015. All four OTV flights launched from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, which is next door to KSC. The first three landed at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California; OTV-4 was the first to come down at the SLF, which, before Sunday, hadn't seen a touchdown since the July 2011 landing of the space shuttle Atlantis. It's not clear what the X-37B is doing while it circles Earth; most of the vehicle's payloads and activities are classified. But Air Force officials have said that the X-37B program's main goals involve testing technologies for future spacecraft and reusable spaceflight systems, and taking experiments to space and returning them to Earth.

However, lack of skilled and trained personnel to operate and control target drones may restrain the growth of this market. Based on region, North America is estimated to be the largest market for target drones in 2016. The U.S. is the only country converting old fighter aircraft into aerial targets to help in simulating real-time threat scenarios for military anti-aircraft and missile testing training exercises. „Target Drones offer a solution for threat simulation trainings” The target drones market is projected to grow from USD 3.79 billion in 2016 to USD 6.20 billion by 2022, at a CAGR of 8.55% from 2016 to 2022. The growth of the target drones market can be mainly attributed to factors, such as increased emphasis on enhanced military training and various advantages of target drones over manned target vehicles. However, lack of skilled and trained personnel to operate and control target drones may restrain the growth of this market. „The sub-scaled market segment is estimated to lead the target drones market in 2016” Based on target type, the sub-scaled segment is estimated to lead the target drones market in 2016. The growth of this segment can be attributed to the increased procurement of sub-scaled aerial target drones by armed forces across the globe because advanced capabilities in simulating the threat scenario at comparatively low-cost. „The linefit segment is projected to witness highest growth during the forecast period” Based on fit, the linefit is projected to witness the highest growth from period 2016 to 2022. Owing to limited defense budget allocation in emerging countries, customization of fighter aircraft is not feasible, as most of the emerging countries procure fighter aircraft from the U.S. and Russia, and cannot afford to convert them into aerial targets. Hence, target drones are majorly linefitted. „North America is estimated to be the largest market for target drones in 2016” Based on region, North America is estimated to be the largest market for target drones in 2016. The U.S. is the only country converting old fighter aircraft into aerial targets to help in simulating real-time threat scenarios for military anti-aircraft and missile testing training exercises. The U.S. Air Force is planning to convert a total of 126 units of F-16 into QF-16 target drones. The U.S. is a major procurer of sub-scaled aerial targets. Kratos’ unmanned combat aerial target vehicles business is anticipated double in next two year, based on the contracts awarded to the company by the U.S. Air Force. Break-up of profile of primary participants in the target drones market: By Company Type – Tier 1 – 30%, Tier 2 – 35%, and Tier 3 – 35% By Designation – C Level – 32%, Director Level – 38%, and Others – 30% By Region – North America – 27%, Europe – 18%, Asia-Pacific – 46%, and RoW – 9% Major companies profiled in the report include The Boeing Company (U.S.), Northrop Grumman Corporation (U.S.), QinetiQ Group plc (U.K.), Kratos Defense & Security Solutions, Inc.

FAIRNESS & ACCURACY IN REPORTING FAIR Studies Media Activism Internship Program Store Challenging media bias since 1986. What’s FAIR? Browse Extra! CounterSpin Donate Select Page May 8, 2017 Lockheed Martin-Funded Experts Agree: South Korea Needs More Lockheed Martin Missiles By Adam Johnson The THAAD anti-missile system sure is great, say analysts whose salaries are partly paid for by THAAD’s manufacturer. (photo: DoD/Lockheed Martin) As tensions between the United States and North Korea continue to rise, one think tank, the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), has become a ubiquitous voice on the topic of missile defense, providing Official-Sounding Quotes to dozens of reporters in Western media outlets. All of these quotes speak to the urgent threat of North Korea and how important the United States’s deployment of the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) missile system is to South Korea: “THAADs are tailored to those medium-range threats that North Korea has in spades—North Korea regularly demonstrates that kind of capability,” says Thomas Karako, the director of the Missile Defense Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “THAADs are exactly the kind of thing that you would want for a regional area.” (Wired, 4/23/17) But [CSIS’s Karako] called [THAAD] an important first step. “This is not about having a perfect shield, this is about buying time and thereby contributing to the overall credibility of deterrence,” Karako told AFP. (France24, 5/2/17) THAAD is a decent option, says Thomas Karako, director of the Missile Defense Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) in Washington, citing a perfect intercept record in trials to date. (Christian Science Monitor, 7/21/16) Seeing THAAD as a “natural consequence” of an evolving threat from North Korea, Bonnie Glaser, a senior adviser for Asia at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), told VOA that Washington should continue to tell Beijing “this system is not aimed at China … and [China] will just have to live with this decision.” (Voice of America, 3/22/17) Victor Cha, a Korea expert and former White House official now at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, played down the chances that THAAD would be rolled back. “If THAAD is deployed prior to the elections and given the North Korean missile threat, I don’t think it would be prudent for a new government to ask that it be walked back,” Cha said. (Reuters, 3/10/17) Thomas Karako, senior fellow with the International Security Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said China’s indirect, retaliatory measures over the THAAD deployment would only stiffen the resolve of South Korea. He called the Chinese intervention “short-sighted.” (Voice of America, 1/23/17) The list goes on. In the past year, FAIR has noted 30 media mentions of CSIS pushing the THAAD missile system or its underlying value proposition in US media, most of them in the past two months. Business Insider was the most eager venue for the think tank’s analysts, routinely copying–and–pasting CSIS talking points in stories warning of the North Korean menace. Omitted from all these CSIS media appearances, however, is that one of CSIS’s top donors, Lockheed Martin, is THAAD’s primary contractor—Lockheed Martin’s take from the THAAD system is worth about $3.9 billion alone. Lockheed Martin directly funds the Missile Defense Project Program at CSIS, the program whose talking heads are cited most frequently by US media. While it’s unclear how much exactly Lockheed Martin donates to CSIS (specific totals are not listed on their website, and a CSIS spokesperson wouldn’t tell FAIR when asked), they are one of the top ten donors, listed in the “$500,000 and up” category. It’s unclear how high “and up” goes, but the think tank’s operating revenue for 2016 was $44 million. None of these pieces mentioned that 56 percent of South Koreans oppose the deployment of THAAD, at least until new elections are held on May 9. The person who greenlit the THAAD deployment, former President Park Geun-hye, left in disgrace after a fraud scandal—throwing the legitimacy of the THAAD deployment into question, and turning it into a hot-button issue in the subsequent election. In light of her impeachment—and, no doubt, the surprise election of a capricious President Trump in the US—most South Koreans understandably want to wait until the new election before making a decision on THAAD. Beyond a few articles making opaque reference to South Koreans having “mixed” reactions, or glossing over local protests, this fact was omitted from US media reports altogether. Trump, the Pentagon and US weapons contractors knew what’s best and were coming to the rescue. Unlike corporate media outlets, The Nation (2/25/17) felt a need to talk to opponents of deploying new US weaponry. None of the 30 pieces with pro-THAAD talking heads from CSIS quoted South Korean peace activists or anti-THAAD voices. To find out the concerns of Korean THAAD critics, one had to turn to independent media reports, like Christine Ahn’s in The Nation (2/25/17): “It will threaten the very economic and social lifeblood of the communities,” [Korean-American policy analyst Simone Chun] said…. “The deployment of THAAD will increase tensions between South and North Korea,” said Ham Soo-yeon, a resident of Gimcheon who has been publishing newsletters about their resistance. In a phone interview, Ham said THAAD would “make the unification of Korea more difficult,” and that it would “place the Korean peninsula at the center of the US drive for dominant power over Northeast Asia.” None of these concerns made it into the above articles. Five of CSIS’s ten major corporate donors (“$500,000 and up”) are weapons manufacturers: Besides Lockheed Martin, they are General Dynamics, Boeing, Leonardo-Finmeccanica and Northrop Grumman. Three of it its top four government donors (“$500,000 and up”) are the United States, Japan and Taiwan. South Korea also gives money to CSIS through the governmental Korea Foundation ($200,000-$499,000). Last August (8/8/16), the New York Times revealed internal documents of CSIS (and the Brookings Institution) showing how think tanks acted as undisclosed lobbyists for weapons manufacturers: As a think tank, the Center for Strategic and International Studies did not file a lobbying report, but the goals of the effort were clear. “Political obstacles to export,” read the agenda of one closed-door “working group” meeting organized by Mr. Brannen that included Tom Rice, a lobbyist in General Atomics’ Washington office, on the invitation lists, the emails show. Boeing and Lockheed Martin, drone-makers that were major CSIS contributors, were also invited to attend the sessions, the emails show. The meetings and research culminated with a report released in February 2014 that reflected the industry’s priorities. “I came out strongly in support of export,” Mr. Brannen, the lead author of the study, wrote in an email to Kenneth B. Handelman, the deputy assistant secretary of state for defense trade controls. But the effort did not stop there. Mr. Brannen initiated meetings with Defense Department officials and congressional staff to push for the recommendations, which also included setting up a new Pentagon office to give more focus to acquisition and deployment of drones. The center also stressed the need to ease export limits at a conference it hosted at its headquarters featuring top officials from the Navy, the Air Force and the Marine Corps. CSIS denied to the Times that its activities constituted lobbying. In response to FAIR’s request for comment, a CSIS spokesperson “rejected [FAIR’s] assertion entirely” that there was any conflict. CSIS’s consistent promotion of its funder’s missile system could, of course, be a total coincidence. The bespectacled experts at CSIS could honestly believe the majority of South Koreans are wrong, and Trump’s deployment of THAAD is a wise choice. Or it could be that think tanks funded by weapons makers are not impartial arbiters of whether more weapons are a good idea—and not useful sources to readers who are hoping for neutral analysis of such questions.   Filed under: North Korea, Think tanks, War/Military Share: Rate: PreviousTrump Uses Power of FCC to Pay Back Friends at Sinclair Broadcasting About The Author Adam Johnson Adam Johnson is a contributing analyst for FAIR.org.

The US Air Force has two X-37B Orbital Test Vehicles, which it calls its "newest and most advanced reentry spacecraft." At 29 feet long and with a 14-foot wingspan, the planes are about one-quarter of the size of NASA's retired space shuttles and have a cargo bay about the size of a pickup truck's. The first X-37 program started in 1999, and the X-37B first flew in April 2010, returning after eight months. The next mission, launched in March 2011, was 15 months, and the third mission, in December 2012, lasted 22 months. "Our team has been preparing for this event for several years, and I am extremely proud to see our hard work and dedication culminate in today's safe and successful landing of the X-37B," Air Force Brig. Gen. Wayne Monteith, the commander of the 45th Space Wing, said in a release. The most recent X-37B mission, launched in May 2015, brings the orbital test vehicle program to a total of 2,085 days spent in orbit. Amateur astronomers have spotted the craft through telescopes and observed it at relatively low altitudes — a little less than 200 miles, according to some, which is lower than the International Space Station. What the X-37Bs have done during those 2,085 days in orbit is less clear, however. The X-37B program "performs risk reduction, experimentation, and concept-of-operations development for reusable space-vehicle technologies," the Air Force said in its release. The Air Force has said the program is testing "advanced guidance, navigation and control, thermal protection systems, avionics, high-temperature structures and seals, conformal reusable insulation, lightweight electromechanical flight systems, advanced propulsion systems, advanced materials and autonomous orbital flight, reentry and landing." View photos X-37B space plane astronautMore (The Air Force X-37B Orbital Test Vehicle at NASA's Kennedy Space Center Shuttle Landing Facility on May 7.US Air Force) The US government has also released photos and technical details about the craft, revealing that its maneuvering engine runs on hydrazine and nitrogen tetroxide and that its thermal-protection system is different from that of NASA's space shuttle. According to Air & Space magazine, before the May 2015 launch, the Air Force and NASA divulged the details of two of the craft's payloads: a NASA materials-science experiment and an ionizing thruster the Air Force wanted to test. But the craft's sophistication and the secrecy around its operations have led to speculation about more covert motives. In 2011, Arthur Grantz, a chief engineer at Boeing, which built the X-37B, said the vehicle could eventually be modified to carry passengers, though he didn't say exactly what the US military wanted to do with it. Brian Weeden, a technical adviser at the Secure World Foundation, a nonprofit focused on peaceful space exploration, said the low-altitude orbit and type of thrusters on the X-37B could indicate the US military is looking to move reconnaissance satellites to lower orbits where they could take sharper photos but would require more fuel to maneuver. View photos X-37BMore (The X-37B.US Air Force) The craft may also host intelligence-related hardware for testing or evaluation, according to the foundation. Other observers seem confident that the craft is hosting the development of surveillance equipment. Read More "I think that's probably what they're not telling you, that there are payloads in there that might be part of the design for future reconnaissance satellites," James Andrew Lewis, a director and senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told Air & Space in early 2016. The Air Force is looking with interest at small, advanced sensors, Lewis said, because it wants to shift from big satellites with high price tags to "smaller but equally capable satellites." While the equipment and materials the X-37B is testing may be destined for operational deployment, the X-37B crafts themselves may not move in that direction, Weeden told Air & Space. But that doesn't mean the X-37B's days are numbered. The program's fifth mission will take off later this year from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida. "The ability to land, refurbish, and launch from the same location further enhances the OTV's ability to rapidly integrate and qualify new space technologies," said Randy Walden, director of the Air Force Rapid Capabilities Office.

Trump's plan, released last month, proposes lowering the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 15 percent. The Reforming America’s Taxes Equitably (RATE) Coalition argued that the current corporate tax rate is not competitive and has given its members a disadvantage over its competitors from other countries. "We believe that your proposal will spark an economic boom and make all American companies more competitive in the global marketplace," RATE said in a Monday letter to Trump. "We also believe that your proposal would stop the steady erosion of America's corporate tax base by removing the incentive for companies to flee in pursuit of a more favorable tax rate." In the letter, RATE criticizes the current corporate tax rate. ADVERTISEMENT "It has made it more difficult to invest in our American employees and operations, while limiting the value we're able to create for our shareholders," the group said. The coalition's members include Ford, Boeing, Verizon and Walmart. According to the group's letter, its members currently have an average effective tax rate of 32 percent. The coalition said that it wants to work with the White House and Congress on an overhaul of the tax code. "The RATE Coalition applauds you for providing the presidential leadership that is critical to advancing tax reform," the group told Trump in its letter, which was signed by co-chairs Elaine Kamarck and Jim Pinkerton.    View the discussion thread.

"The sub-scaled market segment is estimated to lead the target drones market in 2016" Based on target type, the sub-scaled segment is estimated to lead the target drones market in 2016. The growth of this segment can be attributed to the increased procurement of sub-scaled aerial target drones by armed forces across the globe because advanced capabilities in simulating the threat scenario at comparatively low-cost. "The linefit segment is projected to witness highest growth during the forecast period" Based on fit, the linefit is projected to witness the highest growth from period 2016 to 2022. Owing to limited defense budget allocation in emerging countries, customization of fighter aircraft is not feasible, as most of the emerging countries procure fighter aircraft from the U.S. and Russia, and cannot afford to convert them into aerial targets. Hence, target drones are majorly linefitted. "North America is estimated to be the largest market for target drones in 2016" Based on region, North America is estimated to be the largest market for target drones in 2016. The U.S. is the only country converting old fighter aircraft into aerial targets to help in simulating real-time threat scenarios for military anti-aircraft and missile testing training exercises. The U.S. Air Force is planning to convert a total of 126 units of F-16 into QF-16 target drones. The U.S. is a major procurer of sub-scaled aerial targets.

The US Air Force posted tweets announcing the return of the X-37B spacecraft, which landed yesterday morning at the Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral after 718 days in orbit. Multiple media outlets reported that the 29-foot-long spacecraft’s return caused a sonic boom that rattled central Florida and could be heard as far away as Tampa and Fort Myers. It is the spacecraft’s first landing in Florida. Previous X-37B missions have landed at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. Source: ASSOCIATED PRESSAP It remains unclear what the spacecraft was doing during its time in orbit. However, in a statement, officials said the X-37B spacecraft is “an experimental test program to demonstrate technologies for a reliable, reusable, unmanned space test platform for the US Air Force”. The X-37B is the first vehicle since NASA’s Shuttle Orbiter that can return experiments to Earth for further inspection and analysis. The unmanned spacecraft was an original NASA project dating back to 1999. It ran until 2004 when NASA transferred the programme over to the US Air Force, which eventually resulted in Boeing creating its first prototype in 2010. The Air Force has flown four successful X-37B missions, beginning with its first launch on 22 April 2010 from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station which lasted eight months. This was followed by its second mission in March 2011 and the third took off in December 2012, lasting 22 months. The first four missions have spent a total of 2,085 days in space. The cost of the most recent and longest mission has not been disclosed. Another mission is scheduled to launch from Cape Canaveral later this year.

Tornheim Ostrow Reisin Berk & Abrams Your LinkedIn Connections at Firm Two major accounting rule changes will soon go into effect and they are expected to have major impacts on how many manufacturers and distributors report their financial results. Here are the details, including what is changing, when the changes must be implemented and how they will affect financial statements. A New Lease on Leases Of the two updates discussed here, the changes to lease accounting are much more straightforward. In fact, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) did not even assemble a transition resource group to help companies implement the updated lease guidance. In a nutshell, Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2016-02, Leases, requires operating leases with terms longer than a year to appear on the lessee's balance sheet. As a result, manufacturers and distributors will report leased warehouse space, vehicles, equipment and other property as right-to-use assets, along with the rent they owe as liabilities. The existing lease accounting rules in U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) require companies to record lease obligations on their balance sheets only when the arrangements are similar to financing transactions, such as rent-to-own contracts for buildings or vehicles. So, operating leases are not reported on the balance sheet under existing GAAP. This fundamental change in financial reporting will make lessees appear more leveraged than they did in the past, even if the company's day-to-day operations have not changed. In some cases, the new standards will cause companies to violate loan covenants, requiring them to obtain waivers from lenders or renegotiate financing terms to reflect higher debt ratios. For public companies, the updated lease accounting standard goes live in 2019. Private companies have an extra year to comply. Companies that issue comparative statements will need to start collecting data to implement the changes well in advance of these deadlines. Major Changes to the Income Statement The changes to revenue recognition under ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, are far more complicated than the updated lease guidance. The new revenue recognition update replaces about 180 pieces of industry-specific guidance in GAAP with a broad, principles-based method for most businesses to recognize revenue. (See "Five Steps to Recognize Revenue" below.) This new approach to revenue recognition is more closely aligned with international financial reporting rules. The changes will be significant, especially for manufacturers and distributors that enter into specialized, long-term contracts with customers. For some companies, the updated guidance will result in earlier revenue recognition than in current practice. This is because the new standard will require companies to estimate the effects of sales incentives, discounts and warranties. The new standard also provides guidance on service revenue and contract modifications. Nearly all manufacturers and distributors will need to beef up their footnote disclosures under the new rules. The update requires detailed breakdowns of revenue by product lines, geographic markets, contract length, services and physical goods. The revenue recognition guidance goes into effect a year before the lease standard. It is effective for public companies in 2018 and private companies in 2019. In December 2016, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) estimated that 22% of public companies had not started implementing the revenue recognition standard guidance and that statistic is likely higher among private firms. Proactive manufacturers that have started the implementation process forewarn of the challenges. Last November, Christine DiFabio, assistant controller at Zoetis, a manufacturer of animal medicines, said during a panel discussion at Financial Executives International's Current Financial Reporting Issues Conference, "For those people who haven't started or are very early, try to start to speed it up, because while you may not think it will have a significant impact financially, it is a significant impact in workload and documentation efforts as well." She described the accounting change as "all encompassing." Michael Cleary, Boeing vice president of accounting and financial reporting, also acknowledged during the panel discussion that the changes under ASU 2014-09 would significantly alter when his company records revenue. Boeing's customer contracts are typically long-term and complicated, so he formed a steering team, including officials from the communications and human resource departments, tasked solely with implementing the new standard. Need Help? With the implementation deadlines for the updated lease and revenue recognition standards fast approaching, it is time to review your contracts. That is the first step in implementing the changes. The next step is to contact your CPA to understand how the changes will affect your company's financial statements in the future. Sidebar: Five Steps to Recognize Revenue Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-09 will require companies to follow five steps when deciding how and when to recognize revenue: Identify a contract with a customer; Separate the contract's commitments; Determine the transaction price; Allocate a price to each promise; and Recognize revenue when, or, as the company transfers the promised good or service to the customer, depending on the type of contract. The updated guidance will require companies to exercise more judgment when recognizing revenue than do the existing rules. An accounting professional can help you make informed judgment calls based on the terms of your customer contracts.

America’s “life expectancy gap” is also predicted to grow even wider in future, with 11.5% of US counties having experienced an increase in the risk of death for residents aged 25–45 over the period studied (1980-2014). No previous study has put the disparity at even close to 20 years. “This is way worse than any of us had assumed,” said Ali Mokdad, professor of global health at the University of Washington’s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation and one of the authors of the study, published by the journal JAMA Internal Medicine. The researchers found that while residents of certain affluent counties in central Colorado had the highest life expectancy at 87 years, people in several counties of North and South Dakota, typically those with Native American reservations, could expect to die far younger, at only 66. I hope policymakers will look at this and say it's not about politics any more, but the future of the United States Ali Mokdad “The magnitude of these disparities demands action, all the more urgently because inequalities will only increase further if recent trends are allowed to continue uncontested,” the report states. Overall, the study puts average life expectancy in the US at 79.1 years, an increase of 5.3 years from 1980 – the start of a 35-year period for which the university team compared death records, census returns, the human mortality database and figures from the National Center for Health Statistics on a county-by-county basis. But it concludes that this 5.3-year increase “masks massive variation at the county level”. “Counties in central Colorado, Alaska and along both coasts experienced much larger increases, while some southern counties in states stretching from Oklahoma to West Virginia saw little, if any, improvement over this same period,” the report says. “Similarly, there was considerable variation among counties in the percent decline in the mortality risk within each age group. While all counties experienced declines in mortality risk for children 0 to five years, and nearly all experienced declines in the mortality risk for adolescents and older adults 45 to 85, 11.5% [of counties] experienced increases in the risk of death between ages 25 and 45 years.” Facebook Twitter Pinterest Counties in South and North Dakota were found to have the lowest life expectancy; counties along the lower half of the Mississippi, in eastern Kentucky and southwestern West Virginia also had very low life expectancy compared with the rest of the country. Photograph: Dwyer-Lindgren et al/JAMA Internal Medicine If the figures are surprising, the factors cited in the study to explain the “large and increasing” geographic inequalities perhaps are not. The authors point the finger at differences in socioeconomic and race/ethnicity factors, the availability of – and access to – quality healthcare and insurance, and “preventable risk factors” such as smoking, drinking and physical inactivity. “You expect disparities in any country, but you don’t expect the disparities to be increasing in a country with our wealth and might,” Mokdad said. “We spend more money on healthcare than anybody else, and we debate the hell out of healthcare more than anybody else, and still the disparities are increasing. Guns, car crashes and drugs cut US male life expectancy by a year, research says Read more “Everybody, in Europe and elsewhere, is increasing life expectancy at a greater pace than we are, so that’s also disappointing and not acceptable for a country like the US. “Compare us to Australia – a young country, lots of immigrants, a native population – and they have been more aggressive than us in many of the laws for prevention. On gun control, on drinking and driving, they’re ahead of us. On tobacco – their packaging on tobacco, their advertisements – we’re not even close to them right now.” Analysis of county-by-county statistics allowed the study team to identify the areas of greatest inequality and incorporate their findings into a colour-coded map of the US, where counties in which life expectancy at birth is low are shaded in red, and those with longer expectations are blue. As well as the pockets in the Dakotas, swaths of dark red are particularly prevalent in rural western Mississippi, eastern Kentucky and southwestern West Virginia – areas that are all considered to be generally economically challenged. Meanwhile, the darkest blue covers most of central Colorado, western Wyoming and Texas, the majority of the coastal counties of California and southwestern Florida, with a concentration also seen in southern Minnesota. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Counties in central Colorado, Alaska and along both coasts experienced larger increases in life expectancy between 1980 and 2014, while some southern counties saw little, if any, improvement. Photograph: Dwyer-Lindgren et al/JAMA Internal Medicine According to Mokdad, the ongoing wrangling in the US Congress over health insurance reform perfectly showcases one of the factors cited for the inequality. “Many people don’t have health insurance, but even among those who do it’s misleading,” he said. Inequality index: where are the world's most unequal countries? Read more “My insurance, for example, allows me to go to a doctor for an exam and a blood test and they’ll tell me if I have a problem early on. Many don’t have that luxury, only catastrophic insurance, so if they’re hit by a car they’ll be treated. “There are disparities by race, by economy, by geography. In Seattle there’s a good medical centre but if I have a heart attack and I’m two hours away in the mountains, it’s going to take me longer to get good care. “If you decide to eat right it’s so expensive. We’re one of the richest cities in the country – we have Amazon, Boeing, Microsoft, headquartered here among many other companies – but if you go into some stores here in the poor areas south of the city, you can’t buy fresh fruit, vegetables and salads. “We have places where there’s an obesity epidemic, and we have an epidemic of smoking that’s coming down but still as high in some rural areas as Europe and the Middle East.” Previous studies recorded lower variations ranging from 12 to 17 years between counties, with the highest and lowest life expectancies in both 2007 and 2010. These were an underestimation, according to the University of Washington team, because data from smaller counties was either combined with others or excluded altogether. The Inequality Project: the Guardian's in-depth look at our unequal world Read more Mokdad said he was looking for the report to start a conversation between communities, healthcare experts and policymakers about narrowing the inequality gap. “In the US, do we want to wait for people to come to the hospital so we can treat them? That’s a failure,” he said. “We need to make an investment in prevention. “People who are sick need the best treatment, we all agree, but that investment shouldn’t be at the expense of what is really important: planning the health of a nation and prevention of disease. I’m hoping the policymakers will look at this and say whatever we are doing is not about politics any more, it’s about the future of the United States.” Over the coming year, the Guardian’s Inequality Project will shed new light on issues of inequality and social unfairness around the world.

Credit: USAF James Dean, Florida Today , WVEC 4:49 AM. CDT May 08, 2017 An unmanned Air Force X-37B space plane on Sunday morning landed at Kennedy Space Center's Shuttle Landing Facility, completing a more than 700-day mission. (Photo: US Air Force) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST CAPE CANAVERAL, FL (Florida Today) -- An unmanned military space plane on Sunday morning concluded a nearly two-year mission with its first touchdown on Kennedy Space Center's former shuttle runway. The Air Force reported shortly after 8 a.m. that the reusable X-37B Orbital Test Vehicle had landed safely to complete its fourth classified mission. The exact time was not confirmed. The #AirForce #X37B #OTV4 has returned from orbit and has landed safely @NASAKennedy. Stay tuned for more info.— U.S. Air Force (@usairforce) May 7, 2017 Video posted by the Air Force from a runway camera showed the winged craft whiz overhead, touch down on wheels on the runway's north end and race down the three-mile, concrete strip before rolling to a stop in daylight. Crews wearing protective suits for hazardous operations met the mini-shuttle that measures about 29 feet long — about a quarter the length of NASA's shuttle orbiters — with a nearly 15-foot wingspan. The fourth X-37B mission, known as OTV-4, launched from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station atop a United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket on May 20, 2015, for a total mission duration of 718 days — the most yet by about six weeks. "The landing of OTV-4 marks another success for the X-37B program and the nation," said Lt. Col. Ron Fehlen, X-37B program manager, in a press release. "This mission once again set an on-orbit endurance record and marks the vehicle's first landing in the state of Florida. We are incredibly pleased with the performance of the space vehicle and are excited about the data gathered to support the scientific and space communities. We are extremely proud of the dedication and hard work by the entire team." An unmanned Air Force X-37B space plane on Sunday morning landed at Kennedy Space Center's Shuttle Landing Facility, completing a more than 700-day mission.   (Photo: US Air Force) The landing was the first on KSC’s Shuttle Landing Facility by a spacecraft returning from orbit since Atlantis touched down nearly six years ago to conclude the final flight of NASA’s 30-year space shuttle program. The much larger shuttle orbiters announced astronauts’ return home with twin sonic booms. Before Sunday, it was not known how widely noticed the return of the autonomously flown X-37B would be, but residents in northern Brevard County and across Central Florida reported hearing booms on social media. The Air Force’s two reusable mini-shuttles have now each completed two missions in low Earth orbit, for a total of 2,085 days. The first mission launched in 2010 and flew for about 224 days. Three previous landings occurred at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. PHOTOS: U.S. Air Force's X-37B secret military space plane But the program managed by the Air Force Rapid Capabilities Office and operated by Boeing has since consolidated operations at two of KSC's former shuttle hangars, enabling the mini-shuttles to launch and land in the same place. High bay doors on one hangar identify the site as the “Home of the X-37B.” "Our team has been preparing for this event for several years, and I am extremely proud to see our hard work and dedication culminate in today's safe and successful landing of the X-37B," said Brig. Gen. Wayne Monteith, commander of the Air Force's 45th Space Wing. Details about the purpose of the space planes, which house smaller versions of shuttle payload bays, are mostly kept secret. The Air Force says the vehicles are advancing reusable spacecraft technologies, allowing systems to be tested in space and then inspected back on the ground before being deployed on operational missions. For example, the just-landed mission was known to have included tests of an upgraded electric thruster used by high-value national security satellites, and a NASA materials science experiment. The Secure World Foundation has shot down speculation that the X-37B could be used to attack targets on the ground, saying that scenario has “near zero feasibility." Instead, the foundation says, the platform “is likely to be used for flight testing new reusable space launch vehicle technologies (such as guidance and thermal protection) and on-orbit testing of new sensor technologies and satellite hardware primarily for space-based remote sensing.” The Air Force says the fifth X-37B mission, OTV-5, is scheduled to launch later this year from Cape Canaveral.

Alts Equities Smart-Beta New ETFs ETF Ecosystem Webcasts ETF Newsletter Video Podcasts ETF Strategist Channel Smart Beta Channel Search You Are Here: Home → 2017 → May → Industrial ETFs Look to Cement Trump Trade Status Industrial ETFs Look to Cement Trump Trade Status May 8, 2017 at 10:34 am by Brenton Garen The Industrial Select Sector SPDR (NYSEArca: XLI) is up 8% year-to-date, reaffirming its status as a “Trump trade” and that cyclical sectors remain in style. Although the aerospace and defense industry is perceived as being beholden to Uncle Sam’s whims, the allure of late-cycle sectors, including industrials, in a rising rate environment remains in place. Industrials perform well when interest rates rise because rising rates can go hand-in-hand with economic growth. Increased infrastructure spending is also seen as a catalyst for industrial stocks and ETFs. Potential catalysts for aerospace ETFs include include, renewed airline pricing power evidenced by higher ticket prices, and more fees paid per traveler, increased airline profitability, new aircraft program launches and continued demand for aircraft models and technology. Rivals to XLI include the Fidelity MSCI Industrials Index ETF (NYSEArca: FIDU), iShares U.S. Industrials ETF (NYSEArca: IYJ) and the Vanguard Industrials ETF (NYSEArca: VIS). “Industrial stocks provide opportunities for several styles of investors. They also provide a few bombs that might entice others to buy stocks that are still in serious decline. As for a macro comment on the market and the economy, the signals are a bit mixed. But with more stocks rising than falling, they do lean toward the positive side,” reports Michael Kahn for Barron’s. Even diversified industrial ETFs such as IYJ have significant aerospace exposure. For example, three of IYJ’s top 10 holdings are dedicated aerospace and defense companies while several other industrial conglomerates have large exposure to the aerospace and defense industries. The iShares U.S. Aerospace & Defense ETF (NYSEArca: ITA), PowerShares Aerospace & Defense Portfolio (NYSEArca: PPA) and the SPDR S&P Aerospace & Defense ETF (NYSEArca: XAR) are the aerospace industry ETFs benefiting from the Trump trade. ITA is a cap-weighted ETF, meaning it has larger weights to big-name defense stocks, including Dow components Boeing (NYSE: BA) and United Technologies (NYSE: UTX). XAR is an equal-weight ETF. PPA holds 50 stocks “involved in the development, manufacturing, operations and support of US defense, homeland security and aerospace operations,” according to PowerShares. In addition to political rhetoric, potential catalysts for aerospace ETFs include include, renewed airline pricing power evidenced by higher ticket prices, and more fees paid per traveler, increased airline profitability, new aircraft program launches and continued demand for aircraft models and technology.

With Powerful Sonic Boom Secret Space Plane Lands in Fla. With Powerful Sonic Boom By Matthew Humphries May 8, 2017 06:30am EST 10 Comments The experimental military spacecraft performed over 700 experiments while in orbit, all of which are classified. While every mission SpaceX performs is covered in fine detail and we all await news about Virgin Galactic's attempts to commercialize space flight, the US Air Force has been busy flying an experimental space plane around the Earth. We were reminded of that on Sunday when the unmanned X-37B Orbital Test Vehicle landed at NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida. And what's more impressive than the US military having a functioning space plane is the fact the X-37B orbited Earth for two years without issue (as far as we know). "This mission once again set an on-orbit endurance record and marks the vehicle's first landing in the state of Florida," X-37B program manager Lt. Col. Ron Fehlen said in a statement. "We are incredibly pleased with the performance of the space vehicle and are excited about the data gathered to support the scientific and space communities." The X-37 spacecraft began as a NASA project in 1999 before being transferred to the US Department of Defense in 2004. The first launch occurred in 2010, the second in 2011, the third in 2012, and then this latest mission, OTV-4, launched aboard an Atlas V rocket in May 2015. It now stands as the longest flight yet for the experimental plane. The #X37B #OTV4 is the newest and most advanced re-entry spacecraft. Find out more about today's landing here: https://t.co/GUGgOMQiYg pic.twitter.com/HfHHVnWhYc — U.S. Air Force (@usairforce) May 7, 2017 But while the X-37B's mission was pretty stealth, its arrival back on Earth was a tad noisy. As the Orlando Sentinel reports, the spacecraft's return was accompanied by a huge sonic boom Sunday morning. The paper says these booms were more common when NASA's space shuttle program was in effect. It shut down in 2011, though, so Sunday's landing startled those nearby. Just about everything related to the X-37B is classified. It's a project with an unknown budget for a spacecraft built by Boeing. It was initially funded through a collaboration between NASA, Boeing, and the US Air Force totaling $192 million before a further $301 million contract was awarded to Boeing by NASA in 2002. Clearly a lot more has been spent over the last 15 years to continue development.

We don't know what any of them were, how much the mission cost, or what technology is hidden away inside the space plane's shell, which measures 29-feet long and has a wingspan of 15 feet. The next mission for the X-37B is already being planned. It will launch from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Florida, "later in 2017." Is that going to extend the endurance record yet further?

The FTSE 100 business will own 49pc of the joint venture with Kale, which will target both civilian and military aircraft engine deals, but will initially focus on the TF-X fighter. A co-operation deal was first revealed five months ago, with Rolls using the EJ200 engine that powers the Typhoon jet in service with the RAF as the base from which to develop a new engine. An artist's impression of how the new TF-X fighter may look Rolls is not the only major British business to make inroads in Turkey’s burgeoning defence industry. At the start of the year BAE Systems signed a “heads of agreement” contract with Turkish Aerospace Industries to help design and develop the TF-X. The TF-X is part of Turkey’s plans to develop its defence industry, and the new jet is intended to be a “fifth-generation” aircraft incorporating stealth features that will replace the country’s existing fleet of US-made F-16 jets. It is understood that Turkey could order as many as 250 of the fighters, making it one of the largest military programmes in the world, with each of the jets expected to come with a $100m price tag. Getting on board new defence projects is key to the future of Rolls’s defence aerospace business, which is focused on maintenance of engines already in service rather than developing new ones as a result of a lack of major projects at home. While Rolls won work providing the “lift fan” for the F-35B fighter, rival Pratt & Whitney manufactures the main engine for the stealth jet. Rolls-Royce makes the vertical lift-fan for the F-35B jet Credit: Lockheed-Martin Chris Cholerton, president of defence aerospace at Rolls, said the company was “delighted at the new joint venture”, which will allow it to work with Kale, one of Turkey’s largest industrial conglomerates and which supplies global defence giants including Airbus, Boeing and Lockheed Martin. Osman Okyay, deputy chief executive at Kale, added: “Today we are uniting our energy with one of the biggest jet engine makers of the world. This partnership is a milestone in the development of the aerospace and defence industries of Turkey.” rolls royce shares Turkey is seen as a major market for the global defence industry with the country's position where Europe and the East meet making it a tension point. The country has an annual defence budget of about $15bn, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, making it the 18th biggest in the world. The Ankara government has also previously talked about making the Turkey self-sufficient in defence procurement by the mid-2020s, meaning foreign companies are keen to form partnerships with domestic businesses to ensure they have access to the market.

NEW PRESS RELEASE CATEGORIES ﻿ Business InnovMetric Reports Record PolyWorks® License Sales Worldwide for Fiscal Year 2016 PR-Inside.com: 2017-05-08 14:49:02 QUEBEC CITY, May 08, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- InnovMetric Software Inc., the leading provider of universal 3D metrology software solutions, proudly announced today that worldwide demand for PolyWorks® in fiscal year 2016 (ending March 31, 2017) led to a 20% global sales revenue increase compared to the previous fiscal year. This growth was fueled by all-time record sales of 3300 new licenses of PolyWorks. The PolyWorks sales growth in the three largest Asian markets, China, Japan, and India, has reached an impressive 35%. Moreover, PolyWorks support/maintenance contract sales in North America and in Western European countries have also significantly increased, by 30% and 40% respectively. "2016 represented a defining moment in our company's history: we achieved our 2006 vision of delivering a universal 3D metrology software platform by unifying the worlds of portable metrology and CNC CMMs. Although an impressive achievement in itself, what truly made PolyWorks 2016 a milestone in the metrology industry is the fact that it delivered a truly universal 3D metrology workflow. Portable metrology and CNC CMM operators were now able to define and execute their measurement plans, and review the measurement results, using the same tools and methods within a single software module," said Marc Soucy, President of InnovMetric. "Commercially, it was also a transition year, as our large manufacturing OEM customers needed to assess all the cost-reduction opportunities brought by a universal platform before embracing our unique vision. The remarkable growth in license and support/maintenance sales worldwide shows that PolyWorks 2016 is gaining acceptance and is starting to take root. This is exciting news that should lead to major sales opportunities in FY2017 as we prepare to celebrate the sale of the 20,000th PolyWorks license in June." About InnovMetric Software Founded in 1994 and headquartered in Quebec, QC, Canada, with subsidiaries worldwide, InnovMetric Software Inc. is the leading provider of universal 3D metrology software solutions.

Using large quantities of dune sand from the Arizona desert and crushed basalt from the Napa Valley, ERDC was able to simulate the soil conditions on the moon’s surface. ERDC successfully tested and recommended Boeing-General Motors’ wheel design that consisted of woven zinc-coated music wire, with titanium chevrons riveted to the wire mesh for enhanced traction on the moon’s surface. Apollo 15 landed on the moon with the first operational LRV. ERDC’s recommended solution ensured the successful performance of the LRV and provided a geological bonanza for scientists back on Earth.

Credit: Matt Mills McKnight/Cascade Public Media Can Ballard save America? That’s a lot to ask. But Seattle’s old Scandinavian neighborhood could offer a cultural and political lifeline to the kind of America many in our blue bubble aspire to. It begins with a $47-million project to build a new Nordic Heritage Museum. A year from now, in May 2018, it will open on Market Street — a sleek modern steel structure based on the idea of a glacier-cut fjord. It will form a kind of cultural link between modern Ballard and old Ballard, standing as it does between a gentrifying neighborhood and the fishing boats of Salmon Bay. The old museum had to find a new home. It was lodged for decades in an old school that is now being reclaimed by the school district to meet the demands of new families. Which event provided an opportunity for a museum move and makeover, less devoted to Seattle’s Nordic newcomers who gravitated to Ballard in the 19th and early 20th century to a museum that also connects people with the Nordic countries of today, famed for tech, design and progressive social engineering. These countries  are Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Finland and Iceland — sometimes viewed as the “Five White Swans” that are, in a Danish poet’s phrasing, flying together. The Swans are playing a role in shaping the message you will find in the new Ballard museum. In addition to old steamer trunks and pioneer tools, you’ll find contemporary exhibits on Ballard’s mother countries. The museum itself has been cultivating ties with those nations, seeking their advice and support. The links with the Swans will be reflected in bridges connecting sections of the new museum’s upper floors across a high-ceilinged “Fjord Hall.” You’ll be able to cross between galleries featuring past and present, Seattle and Scandinavia. Eric Nelson, the museum’s director, says the exhibit narrative will be driven by four core themes: openness, social justice, innovation, and respect for nature. Those themes reflect how Seattleites see themselves. Nature, tech, tolerance and fairness are consensus virtues here. They also match exactly the qualities Nordic countries are touting these days, with a sense of pride in their own accomplishments, but also a renewed urgency. That was driven home by a delegation of Nordic diplomats that flew into Seattle in early May to tell us about their countries, and what has made them successful. The group included the Ambassador of Denmark, Lars Lose, and staff from the other Nordic embassies. Seattle is part of an American tour that started in Minneapolis, San Francisco and Seattle — “easy audiences,” says one of the diplomats, places where the progressive politics of Scandinavia — not socialism, but social democratic capitalism — finds sympathetic hearts and minds. A tour of the museum construction project Credit: Matt Mills McKnight/Cascade Public Media Like any missionaries, they have a book that embodies their beliefs. It’s called “Nordic Ways,” a compilation of essays that describe what makes the Nordic countries so special. Taxes are high, but citizens get free health care, free day care and free education through college. Even in a fiercely competitive global economy, the skies of such a welfare state haven’t fallen, at least not yet. There is full employment, women have economic and political equality, and the Nordic economies are doing very well. They are proof that social welfare states can thrive. Madeleine Lyrvall, wife of the Swedish ambassador, tells me the Nordic countries “are a bit like a bumblebee — it shouldn’t be able to fly but it does.” They defy the American conservative view of what works and what will bring disaster. They say they are sharing their formula for success to create dialogue and understanding. But it is clear there is also worry about the direction the U.S. is taking in the Trumptimes. Trade is a huge issue — America is a big partner. So is climate change. Goran Lithell of the Swedish embassy says we have only 10 to 15 years before it’ll be too late to turn around global warming, something the Nordic countries are hyper-aware of, given their fragile Arctic ecosystems. Another big issue is the Nordics working in this country — Scandinavia is a big source of tech talent, and has long been. Boeing used to hire engineers from SAAB, now Microsoft and Amazon hire from the companies that produced Minecraft and Spotify. Seattle is pre-sold on much of the Nordic Model — our public officials junket to Copenhagen for lessons in sustainability, and Bergen and Reykjavik are sister cities. But in revealing their recipes for success, the Nordic Way also reveals barriers. The Nordic peoples trust governments, Americans do not. Nordic culture rests on cultural commonalities and a belief in collaboration. The U.S. is defined by competition and individualism. We might want what they have, but we don’t have the basic ingredients — we’re without the butter, sugar and eggs to bake a proper Danish. The Swans have maximized the assets of homogeneity and common history. If people think Seattle is too white, the Swans are even whiter. Their cultural and ethnic bulwark is being challenged by globalization and immigration. Nationalism is on the rise in Scandinavia as the countries attempt to assimilate huge numbers of refugees and immigrants, many from the Middle East. Will the Nordic Model thrive under such pressures? How will they adapt? Will low-wage workers erode Nordic egalitarianism that seeks to lessen the gaps between rich, poor and middle? But there is value in ties with other countries. As cities like Seattle become more isolated from national politics, maintaining international connections becomes doubly important. We’re undergoing a kind of soft secession from the U.S government under Trump, and we’re going to need friends, partners and allies for moral support, ideas and talent. Through trade and immigration, Seattle has huge ties to Asia and the Pacific. But our ties to the Atlantic are strong too. Eric Nelson says some 600,000 Washingtonians self-identify as being of Nordic or Scandinavian heritage, and Ballard has historically been one of the largest Scandinavian communities outside the old countries. Those ties are a strain of our civic DNA. The new Nordic Heritage Museum is poised to claim a budding role in building and strengthening alliances with like minds. In the new world, Seattle is going to need all the friends — and good role models — it can get. Read more about: mossback Show comments + - Like this article? Help us write more like it.

provided by Grupo Aeromexico S.A.B. de C.V. 08 May, 2017, 08:14 ET Share this article ATLANTA and MEXICO CITY, May 8, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Grupo Aeroméxico, S.A.B. de C.V.  (Mexico: AEROMEX.MX) and Delta Air Lines (NYSE: DAL) today begin their joint cooperation agreement (JCA) to operate transborder flights between the United States and Mexico. Delta and Aeromexico have confirmed with the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) and Mexico's Federal Economic Competition Commission (COFECE) that they have completed the steps required to launch the JCA.  The carriers are writing a new chapter in the history of aviation in the Americas with the first immunized transborder alliance between Mexico and the United States. This partnership will allow the carriers to expand competition and serve new destinations.  Additional service and more convenient schedules will benefit customers of both companies, while deepening the relationship the airlines have shared for more than 20 years.

They found their solution from Terma North America Inc. in Arlington, Va. Officials of the Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division in Lakehurst, N.J., announced a $14.3 million contract late last month to the Northrop Grumman Mission Systems segment in Rolling Meadows, Ill., for 38 Terma ALQ-213 electronic warfare management systems for the P-8A aircraft. Terma’s ALQ-213(V) electronic warfare management unit offers a non-ITAR controller for a military aircraft survivability equipment (ASE) suite, which provides automatic threat reaction and decision support algorithms and on-board training for P-8A aircraft crews. This contract comprises 27 ALQ-213 tactical threat displays for the U.S. Navy; three for the United Kingdom; eight for Australia, as well as 29 OMNI blade antennas for U.S. Navy; two for the United Kingdom; and eight for Australia. Related: Elisra of Israel and Terma of Denmark join forces to develop airborne EW and aircraft survivability systems The contract also involves component and system level software and hardware integration and testing prior to system delivery. Northrop Grumman and Terma agreed in 2007 to cooperate on airborne electronic warfare products and projects. Terma North America is the U.S. holding company for the North American activities of Terma A/S in Lystrup, Denmark. The low-power ALQ-213(V) electronic warfare management unit uses no forced air cooling, has a dual-core PowerPC microprocessor and a large field programmable gate array (FPGA). The unit also has a Wind River VxWorks operating system.[Native Advertisement] The Terma ALQ-213(V) has an expansion slot for drop-in of one special purpose circuit cards. The expansion slot provides a fast PCI express interface to the dual-core CPU and can be supported by a dedicated external connector, with minimal impact to the unit design. The electronic warfare management unit typically integrates several aircraft survivability equipment sensors and effectors typically via one or more MIL-STD-1553B data buses and discrete and serial interfaces. Related: Boeing to upgrade sonar signal processing on Navy P-8A anti-submarine warfare (ASW) aircraft The electronic warfare management unit can integrate cockpit multi-function display and control units or provide graphical human interaction via terma’s advanced threat display. The electronic warfare management unit can integrate available sources for time, position, and attitude data to provide low-latency data in any required format to aircraft survivability equipment systems and functions. On this contract Northrop Grumman will do the work in Rolling Meadows, Ill.; Seattle; Jacksonville Naval Air Station, Fla.; Whidbey Island Naval Air Station, Wash.; Lossimouth, Scotland; and Edinburgh, Australia, and should be finished by February 2020.

Rough cut (no reporter narration) ▲ Hide Transcript ▶ View Transcript ROUGH CUT (NO REPORTER NARRATION) The U.S. military's experimental X-37B space plane landed on Sunday (May 7) at NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida, completing a classified mission that lasted nearly two years, the Air Force said. The unmanned X-37B, which resembles a miniature space shuttle, touched down at 7:47 a.m. EDT (1147 GMT) on a runway formerly used for landings of the now-mothballed space shuttles, the Air Force said in an email. The Boeing-built space plane blasted off in May 2015 from nearby Cape Canaveral Air Force Station aboard an Atlas 5 rocket built by United Launch Alliance, a partnership between Lockheed Martin Corp and Boeing Co . The X-37B, one of two in the Air Force fleet, conducted unspecified experiments for more than 700 days while in orbit. It was the fourth and lengthiest mission so far for the secretive program, managed by the Air Force Rapid Capabilities Office.

U.S. Air Force/Handout via Reuters The US Air Force’s X-37B space plane returned to Earth on Sunday after completing a secret space mission that lasted nearly two years. The reusable, unmanned X-37B Orbital Test Vehicle landed at the Shuttle Landing Facility at Nasa’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida, an airport used by the US space agency’s Space Shuttle for landing until the programme’s end in 2011. The just-ended mission, known as Orbital Test Vehicle mission 4 (OTV-4), was launched in May 2015 and conducted secret experiments for a total of 718 days while in orbit, Xinhua news agency reported. It’s the fourth and longest-running mission for the X-37B programme, run by the US Air Force’s Rapid Capabilities Office. The programme began as a Nasa project in 1999 but was later transferred to the Pentagon. “The landing of OTV-4 marks another success for the X-37B programme and the nation,” Lt. Col. Ron Fehlen, X-37B programme manager, was quoted as saying. The X-37B is an unmanned spacecraft built for the US Air Force by Boeing. The spacecraft is meant to be a testing platform for emerging space technologies. One of the objectives of the spacecraft is to test re-usable spacecraft tech for the future of the American space program, another is to conduct science experiments in space and return them to Earth for further analysis.

The reusable, unmanned X-37B Orbital Test Vehicle landed at the Shuttle Landing Facility at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida, an airport used by the U.S. space agency’s Space Shuttle for landing until the program’s end in 2011. The just-ended mission, known as Orbital Test Vehicle mission 4 (OTV-4), was launched in May 2015 and conducted secret experiments for a total of 718 days while in orbit. It’s the fourth and longest-running mission for the X-37B program, run by the U.S. Air Force’s Rapid Capabilities Office. The program began as a NASA project in 1999 but was later transferred to the Pentagon. “The landing of OTV-4 marks another success for the X-37B program and the nation,” Lt. Col. Ron Fehlen, X-37B program manager, said in a statement. “This mission once again set an on-orbit endurance record and marks the vehicle’s first landing in the state of Florida,” Fehlen said. “We are incredibly pleased with the performance of the space vehicle and are excited about the data gathered to support the scientific and space communities.” The first three missions all ended with landings at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. The X-37B, built by Boeing, looks much like NASA’s retired space shuttles, only much smaller. It is boosted into orbit by a rocket and lands like an aircraft on a conventional runway. The exact purpose of the X-37B was never revealed and the secrecy surrounding the project has led to speculation that the solar-powered X-37B can be used as a spy satellite or to deliver weapons from space. The U.S. Air Force only confirmed that the unmanned aircraft “performs risk reduction, experimentation and concept of operations development for reusable space vehicle technologies.” “Technologies being tested in the program include advanced guidance, navigation and control, thermal protection systems, avionics, high temperature structures and seals, conformal reusable insulation, lightweight electromechanical flight systems, advanced propulsion systems, advanced materials and autonomous orbital flight, reentry and landing,” it said. The U.S. Air Force said it’s now preparing to launch the fifth X-37B mission from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Florida, later this year.     Print       Email Published: 1 min ago on May 8, 2017 By: Foreign Affairs Publisher Last Modified: May 8, 2017 @ 2:10 pm Filed Under: Asia Pacific, Asia Pacific Region, China, China State Council Information Office, Defence, Defense, English, MIL OSI, Open Source Intel, Peoples Republic Of China, PRC State Government, Top News NEXT ARTICLE → More Nigerian schoolgirls to regain freedom soon About the author Foreign Affairs Publisher View all articles by Foreign Affairs Publisher » Recent Posts US X-37B space plane lands after 2-yr secret mission More Nigerian schoolgirls to regain freedom soon Namibia proposes genocide remembrance day Iran’s top leader urges massive turnout in elections Palestinian woman shot dead amidst stabbing attempt © 2017 ForeignAffairs.co.nz.

Then you notice it's restricted to US citizens, over 18, and there's an authorization process before you can download the code.   The goal of this challenge, now live on the TopCoder and HeroX platforms is to modify the specialized computational fluid dynamics (CFD) algorithms that NASA runs on its Pleiades supercomputer.   The overview on the NASA Tournament Lab asks: Do you want to help aerospace engineers solve problems faster? Does the phrase “nonlinear partial differential equations used for unsteady computations” excite you? Do you want to try yourself with the complex computational software that NASA scientists use? and in this video Dr Michael Roger, Project Manager of NASA's Transformation Tools and Technologies Project, part of NASA's Aeronautics Research Program says he is looking for a 10 to 1000 times increase in the speed of computation of it's FUN3D software.     There are two challenges running in parallel between now and June 29. The Architecture one is on TopCoder unti with two prizes of $15,000 and $10,000. According to TopCoder in it contestants need to: Show us how to optimize individual software module code and/or inter-node processing in order to reduce overall model computation time and parallelization efficiency.   Ideal submission may include algorithm optimization of the existing code base,  Inter-node dispatch optimization or a combination of the two.  Unlike the Ideation challenge, which is highly strategic, this challenge focuses on measurable improvements of the existing FUN3d suite and is highly tactical.  The Ideation challenge on the HeroX platform has a First place prize of $10,000 and two runner up prizes of $5.000 and involves: Optimizing source code to improve NASA’s FUN3d Computational Fluid Dynamics suite in such a way that flow analysis that previously took months to compute can now be done in days or even hours.  We are hoping this challenge will identify ideas that will improve FUN3D to complete complex flow analysis 1000x faster.  We think there are several approaches to finding solutions that will help NASA achieve 1000x performance improvement and they don’t all require you to be an aeronautical engineer.  Ideas and approaches may include, but are not limited to exploiting algorithmic developments in such areas as grid adaptation, higher-order methods and efficient solution techniques for high performance computing hardware.  To participate in this challenge you first have to apply for access to FUN3D software, the suite of Fortran fluid dynamic programs used by NASA and aeronautics companies like Lockheed and Boeing, for  through an application process with the US Government.   Some background about this software explains why NASA is turning to crowd sourcing: FUN3D was born in the late 1980s as a research code. The code’s original purpose was to study existing algorithms and to develop new algorithms for unstructured-grid fluid dynamic simulations spanning incompressible flow to transonic flow. The project has since grown into a suite of codes that cover not only analysis, but adjoint-based error estimation, mesh adaptation, and design optimization of fluid dynamic problems extending into the hypersonic regime. For FUN3D, you will need a Fortran 2003 compiler. This code has gone through an extensive cleanup/overhaul over the past few years to lay a solid foundation for the extension to flows in thermochemical non-equilibrium, and is considerably easier to use and modify than ever before.  Considering the value to NASA of the speed optimization they are hoping for the total prize pool of $55,000 seems somewhat exploitative especially as the rules of the Ideation contest include:  Innovators who are awarded a prize for their submission must agree to grant NASA a an irrevocable, royalty free, perpetual, sublicensable, transferable, and worldwide license to use and permit others to use all or any part of the solution including, without limitation, the right to make, have made, sell, offer for sale, use, rent, lease, import, copy, prepare derivative works, publicly display, publicly perform, and distribute all or any part of such solution, modifications, or combinations thereof and to sublicense (directly or indirectly through multiple tiers) or transfer any and all such rights. Looking back to other NASA contests that have been on TopCoder, prizes have been similarly modest and rely for participation on the inherent importance of the topic and the kudos of doing well on the community leaderboard.

The reusable, unmanned X-37B Orbital Test Vehicle landed at the Shuttle Landing Facility at NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida, an airport used by the U.S. space agency's Space Shuttle for landing until the program's end in 2011. The just-ended mission, known as Orbital Test Vehicle mission 4 (OTV-4), was launched in May 2015 and conducted secret experiments for a total of 718 days while in orbit. It's the fourth and longest-running mission for the X-37B program, run by the U.S. Air Force's Rapid Capabilities Office. The program began as a NASA project in 1999 but was later transferred to the Pentagon. "The landing of OTV-4 marks another success for the X-37B program and the nation," Lt. Col. Ron Fehlen, X-37B program manager, said in a statement. "This mission once again set an on-orbit endurance record and marks the vehicle's first landing in the state of Florida," Fehlen said. "We are incredibly pleased with the performance of the space vehicle and are excited about the data gathered to support the scientific and space communities." The first three missions all ended with landings at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. The X-37B, built by Boeing, looks much like NASA's retired space shuttles, only much smaller. It is boosted into orbit by a rocket and lands like an aircraft on a conventional runway. The exact purpose of the X-37B was never revealed and the secrecy surrounding the project has led to speculation that the solar-powered X-37B can be used as a spy satellite or to deliver weapons from space. The U.S. Air Force only confirmed that the unmanned aircraft "performs risk reduction, experimentation and concept of operations development for reusable space vehicle technologies." "Technologies being tested in the program include advanced guidance, navigation and control, thermal protection systems, avionics, high temperature structures and seals, conformal reusable insulation, lightweight electromechanical flight systems, advanced propulsion systems, advanced materials and autonomous orbital flight, reentry and landing," it said. The U.S. Air Force said it's now preparing to launch the fifth X-37B mission from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Florida, later this year.

The Air Force shortly after 8 a.m. reported that the experimental X-37B Orbital Test Vehicle had landed safely on NASA’s former space shuttle runway. The exact time was not confirmed.   The #AirForce #X37B #OTV4 has returned from orbit and has landed safely @NASAKennedy. Stay tuned for more info. — U.S. Air Force (@usairforce) May 7, 2017 Video posted by the Air Force from a runway camera showed the winged craft whiz overhead, touch down on wheels on the runway’s north end and race down the three-mile, concrete strip before rolling to a stop in daylight. Crews wearing protective suits for hazardous operations met the mini-shuttle that measures about 29 feet long — about a quarter the length of NASA’s shuttle orbiters — with a nearly 15-foot wingspan. The fourth X-37B mission, known as OTV-4, launched from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station atop a United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket on May 20, 2015, for a total mission duration of 718 days — the most yet by about six weeks. “The landing of OTV-4 marks another success for the X-37B program and the nation,” said Lt. Col. Ron Fehlen, X-37B program manager, in a press release. “This mission once again set an on-orbit endurance record and marks the vehicle’s first landing in the state of Florida. We are incredibly pleased with the performance of the space vehicle and are excited about the data gathered to support the scientific and space communities. We are extremely proud of the dedication and hard work by the entire team.”   The landing was the first on KSC’s Shuttle Landing Facility by a spacecraft returning from orbit since Atlantis touched down nearly six years ago to conclude the final flight of NASA’s 30-year space shuttle program. The much larger shuttle orbiters announced astronauts’ return home with twin sonic booms. The U.S. Air Force is thinking about consolidating mysterious mini-shuttle operations at Kennedy Space Center or Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, the service said today. Video, narration by Caroline Perez. Reporting by Todd Halvorson. (9-27-12) Before Sunday, it was not known how widely noticed the return of the autonomously flown X-37B would be, but residents in northern Brevard County and across Central Florida reported hearing booms on social media. The Air Force’s two reusable mini-shuttles have now each completed two missions in low Earth orbit, for a total of 2,085 days. The first mission launched in 2010 and flew for about 224 days. Three previous landings occurred at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. But the program managed by the Air Force Rapid Capabilities Office and operated by Boeing has since consolidated operations at two of KSC’s former shuttle hangars, enabling the mini-shuttles to launch and land in the same place. High bay doors on one hangar identify the site as the “Home of the X-37B.” “Our team has been preparing for this event for several years, and I am extremely proud to see our hard work and dedication culminate in today’s safe and successful landing of the X-37B,” said Brig. Gen. Wayne Monteith, commander of the Air Force’s 45th Space Wing. Details about the purpose of the space planes, which house smaller versions of shuttle payload bays, are mostly kept secret. The Air Force says the vehicles are advancing reusable spacecraft technologies, allowing systems to be tested in space and then inspected back on the ground before being deployed on operational missions. For example, the just-landed mission was known to have included tests of an upgraded electric thruster used by high-value national security satellites, and a NASA materials science experiment. The Secure World Foundation has shot down speculation that the X-37B could be used to attack targets on the ground, saying that scenario has “near zero feasibility.” Instead, the foundation says, the platform “is likely to be used for flight testing new reusable space launch vehicle technologies (such as guidance and thermal protection) and on-orbit testing of new sensor technologies and satellite hardware primarily for space-based remote sensing.” The Air Force says the fifth X-37B mission, OTV-5, is scheduled to launch later this year from Cape Canaveral.

Chris Scholey, Sheffield City Region board member, who leads on inward investment for the SCR Local Enterprise Partnership 16:48 Monday 08 May 2017 0 Have your say I am delighted to record that the Sheffield City Region (SCR) is celebrating its best ever year for investment by foreign-owned companies, with growth up by a record 50 per cent on 2016. The nine districts across South Yorkshire, North Derbyshire and North Notts which comprise the SCR have seen a massive £1.9bn pumped into the region, and more than 7,000 jobs created or safeguarded. The figures, compiled by the SCR, represent the most successful year for foreign investment into the region since the SCR was established six years ago to drive economic growth and jobs. Teams from the regeneration departments of the nine local authorities are supported by the region-wide SCR inward investment team to work together to attract foreign companies from overseas, and others already based in the UK looking to relocate and expand. And as the SCR Board member who leads on inward investment for the SCR Local Enterprise Partnership, I would like to pay tribute to the work of the local authorities and their partnership. The nine local authorities and the Sheffield City Region specialists have worked very hard together to encourage investors to come to the region. They have been incredibly successful in securing jobs and investment. As a result the region is looking good. Rachel Clark, director of trade and investment for the SCR, says: “The region is seeing some very exciting success, and the culmination of a lot of hard partnership work with our local authority and business partners. “These investments can often take years to come to fruition – but it’s all worthwhile when the jobs and investment come in and create such fantastic growth.” Among the outstanding success stories are Amazon’s fourth warehouse in Doncaster – the largest number it has in any one place in the UK – and plans by developers Verdion to develop the second stage of the iPort site at Doncaster. Verdion is backed by the giant Canadian pension fund HOOP. A partnership agreement between Sheffield City Council and the Chinese-led Sichaun Guodong will see major investment in Sheffield, including apartments, offices, leisure facilities and, potentially, a five-star hotel. This is the biggest deal for any city outside London, with the first three years worth more than £200m to the city. In the past year foreign companies have invested £500m in 49 projects, creating 2,800 jobs; UK-based foreign-owned companies invested in another 31 projects, creating a further 366 jobs. In the SCR key sectors, advanced manufacturing and engineering accounted for over 30 per cent of the year’s investments. Other important areas, which include automotive, logistics and business, profess-ional and financial services, represented around 60 per cent. Examples include: Peak Resort, the £400m tourism and leisure destination which is underway with £2.9m infrastructure funding from the SCR. The project will create 1,300 jobs. At iPort, the inland port logistics development at Doncaster, investment of £500m has created 1,000 jobs. The SCR is investing £9.1m in the M18 link road to the iPort and on to Doncaster Sheffield Airport. This has also opened up large areas of land for investment and seen record passenger numbers at Doncaster Sheffield Airport. The £300m expansion of Meadowhall shopping centre, set to create 1,000 jobs. A new 44,595 sq m facility at the Markham Vale Enterprise Zone for Great Bear will create 400 new jobs serving the UK domestic market. A second distribution operation at Markham Vale is the largest development there to date. Crean Solutions, the automotive components firm, has established a 2,880 sq metre facility in Barnsley, its first operation in the UK. The £17m investment is expected to create around 40 jobs. The top five project successes in SCR 2016/17 by jobs were: -Amazon, Doncaster 500 -Ferdinand Bilstein, Chesterfield 400 -Aldi, Barnsley 400 -IKEA, Sheffield 400 -McLaren, Rotherham 200 The top five project successes in SCR 2016/17 by investment value were: -Hitachi Maintenance Facility, Doncaster £70m -IKEA, Sheffield £60m -McLaren, Rotherham £50m -Ferdinand Bilstein, Chesterfield £38m -Boeing, Sheffield £20m -Lidl, Doncaster £70m These successes come hard on the heels of the announcement of multi-million-pound investment and the creation of high-value jobs by supercar manufacturer McLaren Automotive and aero giant Boeing. Investment from the big guns McLaren’s move to the SCR sees it working closely with the University of Sheffield Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre to research and produce the chassis for its super cars. Boeing’s first European manufacturing facility in the SCR will produce actuation systems – used on wing flaps – for the next generation 737, 737 MAX and 777 aircraft. This investment is set to produce a significant amount of supply chain opportunities.

Residents tweeted shocked reactions as the sky cracked loudly in the early hours of Sunday morning. Thought somebody crashed into my garage ... It was just a sonic boom 🙄😐 Thanks @NASA for the scare!— Felicity Smoak (@6thGreekLetter) May 7, 2017 thought i was getting robbed, turns out it was the sonic boom pic.twitter.com/RGhf6uXMcb— Vibhuti Patel (@TheVibhutiPatel) May 7, 2017 Lasting some 718 days the X-37B craft broke records for being the lengthiest mission conducted by the Air Force. It is one of two unmanned planes conducting these orbits.  This secrecy around the project has led to much speculation, with some even suggesting the craft is some sort of space weapon. But the Air Force has always denied this notion, insisting that it is testing technologies for future spacecraft travel. The orbiters "perform risk reduction, experimentation and concept-of-operations development for reusable space vehicle technologies," it said said in a statement without providing details.  The Secure World Foundation, a nonprofit group promoting the peaceful exploration of space, says the secrecy surrounding the X-37B suggests the presence of intelligence-related hardware being tested or evaluated aboard the craft. The Air Force has refused to reveal the cost of the programme.  The office of the secretary of the Air Forced heralded the landing of the X-37B plane on Sunday as proof a major advancement in the project. "The landing of OTV-4 marks another success for the X-37B program and the nation," said Ron Fehlen, a lieutenant colonel and X-37B program manager.  A handout photo made available by the US Department of Defense on 08 May 2017 shows the US Air Force's X-37B Orbital Test Vehicle mission 4 after landing at NASA's Kennedy Space Center Shuttle Landing Facility in Florida, USA, 07 May 2017.  Credit: US AIR FORCE / US DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE HANDOUT/US DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE "This mission once again set an on-orbit endurance record and marks the vehicle's first landing in the state of Florida.  "We are incredibly pleased with the performance of the space vehicle and are excited about the data gathered to support the scientific and space communities." The vehicles resemble a miniature version of NASA's now retired space shuttles. The original Space Shuttle system had carried up to eight astronauts into low Earth Orbit.  The shuttle would re-enter the Earth's atmosphere upon completing its mission and land like a glider. It was not without its dangers: in the course of 135 missions flown, two orbiters were destroyed, killing 14 astronauts.  These new aircraft are 29 feet  long and have a wingspan of 15 feet, making them about one quarter of the size of the original shuttles, which were retired in 2011.  Like the space shuttle, the X-37B lands on a runway, plane-style, but does so autonomously. NASA Greatest Achievements and Discoveries, in Pictures A  fact sheet for the vehicle states that the space plane is designed to spend up to 270 days in orbit at a time. But so far several of the missions have much exceeded that limit. Also known as the Orbital Test Vehicle, or OTV, first flew in April 2010 and stayed aloft for 225 days.  A second mission launched in March 2011 and lasted 15 months, while a third flight took off in December 2012 and returned after 22 months.  The Boeing-built space plane blasted off for this mission in May 2015 from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station aboard an Atlas 5 rocket built by United Launch Alliance, a partnership between Lockheed Martin Corp and Boeing Company.  Experts have suggested that engineers testing technologies for future satellites want to see how well these materials survive in space environment for long periods of time.

Wash., May 8, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- When the Coast Guard Cutter STRATTON left its home port in Alameda, Calif., earlier this year, it was the first U.S. Coast Guard cutter to deploy fully equipped with a small unmanned aerial system (sUAS) for an entire patrol. That sUAS was ScanEagle, and by the end of the deployment, the aircraft had directly assisted the STRATTON crew with conducting four interdictions, seizing more than 1,676 kilograms of illicit contraband valued at $55 million and apprehending ten suspected drug traffickers. During the six-week deployment in the eastern Pacific Ocean, ScanEagle flew 39 sorties for a total of 279 hours, including one operation where the aircraft provided persistent surveillance for 22.7 flight hours in a 24-hour period. ScanEagle was equipped with multiple sensors including electro-optic, thermal and telescope cameras that delivered a range of aerial imagery to the STRATTON crew and decision makers, enabling them to better execute real-time actionable intelligence. The information ScanEagle provided will assist with prosecution efforts by the U.S. Department of Justice. Insitu's ScanEagle unmanned air vehicle helped theUS Coast Guard intercept more than six tons of cocaine during a recent deployment aboard USCGC STRATTON. The event marked the first time a USCG cutter used a small UAS for an entire patrol. "We are proud to celebrate the great success of this first deployment, and thank these brave men and women of the U.S. Coast Guard for the work they do to keep our nation and our global waters safe," said Ryan M. Hartman, Insitu's president and CEO. The CGC STRATTON deployment is the first under Insitu's June 2016 contract award to provide UAS ISR services aboard one Coast Guard national security cutter. Last month, the Coast Guard released a draft request for proposal to procure sUAS capabilities for its entire national security cutter fleet.

the Coast Guard Cutter STRATTON left its home port in Alameda, Calif., earlier this year, it was the first U.S. Coast Guard cutter to deploy fully equipped with a small unmanned aerial system (sUAS) for an entire patrol. That sUAS was ScanEagle, and by the end of the deployment, the aircraft had directly assisted the STRATTON crew with conducting four interdictions, seizing more than 1,676 kilograms of illicit contraband valued at $55 million and apprehending ten suspected drug traffickers.

The event marked the first time a USCG cutter used a small UAS for an entire patrol. (PRNewsfoto/Insitu) During the six-week deployment in the eastern Pacific Ocean, ScanEagle flew 39 sorties for a total of 279 hours, including one operation where the aircraft provided persistent surveillance for 22.7 flight hours in a 24-hour period. ScanEagle was equipped with multiple sensors including electro-optic, thermal and telescope cameras that delivered a range of aerial imagery to the STRATTON crew and decision makers, enabling them to better execute real-time actionable intelligence. The information ScanEagle provided will assist with prosecution efforts by the U.S. Department of Justice. "We are proud to celebrate the great success of this first deployment, and thank these brave men and women of the U.S. Coast Guard for the work they do to keep our nation and our global waters safe," said Ryan M. Hartman, Insitu's president and CEO. The CGC STRATTON deployment is the first under Insitu's June 2016 contract award to provide UAS ISR services aboard one Coast Guard national security cutter. Last month, the Coast Guard released a draft request for proposal to procure sUAS capabilities for its entire national security cutter fleet.

No one was injured, and the aging plane, which rolled off the assembly line when John F. Kennedy was president, landed safely. But Air Force Col. April Vogel, the base commander, wasn't taking any chances. She immediately ordered inspections of each of MacDill's 16 tankers, shared and maintained by the 6th Air Mobility Wing and the 927th Air Refueling Wing. It took crews working 12-hour shifts three months to complete the inspections on the aircraft, valued at a total of nearly $1 billion. Such efforts highlight the challenges MacDill crews face trying to keep the KC-135s in the air at a time when they are flying nearly 2 1/2 times their scheduled hours fleet-wide, largely as a result of the ongoing fight against the Islamic State. Every five minutes, tankers like the ones at MacDill refuel an aircraft heading to strike ISIS. Overall, they made more than 110,000 refueling flights last year just in the U.S. Central Command region alone, according to the Air Force. Each tanker carries a maximum of 200,000 pounds of fuel, enough to fill the average car about 2,500 times. It's delivered midair via an extending boom at the back. MacDill tankers fly 19,000 hours and deliver 186 million pounds of fuel to about 14,000 aircraft every year. All that flying gas delivery takes a toll on MacDill's 600-plus aircraft maintenance personnel, who know their task can have fatal consequences. So far, their work has paid off. No MacDill tanker has ever crashed. And though they are old, the jets' safety record actually has improved through the years. There's been just one fatal Stratotanker accident across the entire fleet since 1999, a 2013 crash in Kyrgyzstan that killed all three crew members. "These are antique aircraft," said Capt. Jessica Brown, a spokeswoman for the 6th Air Mobility Wing. "But they are still very much capable because of the airmen tasked with keeping them relevant. Failure is not an option." • • • On a blistering Friday afternoon, seven Stratotankers — nearly half of MacDill's fleet — are lined up on the flight line. The base clock thermometer shows the air temperature is 95 degrees, but the sun reflecting off the flight line makes it seem even hotter. And hotter still inside the parked tanker jets when the air conditioning systems aren't running. High above the surface, sweating members of the 6th Aircraft Maintenance Squadron are perched in a bucket, making repairs to a navigation system. Elsewhere on the flight line, a Stratotanker is missing a landing gear door. The story of its repair illustrates the challenges of fixing things on airplanes that were made between 1957 and 1964. The door had loose rivets, according to Master Sgt. Roger Mitchell, the squadron's lead production superintendent. When it was brought into the shop, crews found that the rib underneath the surface was cracked. From a purely technical standpoint, it would be relatively easy to take off the sheet metal, repair or replace the rib and cover it back up again. But this is the Air Force, and nothing is ever simple. The landing gear door rib is one of many items on the Stratotanker that requires permission from a higher headquarters to repair. That takes time. So would finding a spare rib from one of the many bases that might have one. To save time, the wing just ordered an entire new door assembly. It's a matter of quality assurance, said Maj. Ryan Garlow, commander of the 6th Aircraft Maintenance Squadron. "Before you are allowed to make something that goes on an airplane, we have to make sure the Air Force is willing to take that risk," said Garlow, a pilot whose grandfather also flew Stratotankers. Not every maintenance job involves fixing things. Near the northern end of the flight line, crews give one of the Stratotankers a good scrub-down. It is a routine procedure, usually carried out by the newest airmen, to battle some of the Stratotanker's toughest enemies — Florida's highly corrosive salt air and scorching sun. It's such a big problem that every couple of years, Air Mobility Command moves Stratotankers from base to base to help reduce the corrosive effects. • • • The following Monday, a Stratotanker built in 1961 fills the cavernous Hangar 2. Airmen peer into cracks and crevices. They check hundreds of nuts and bolts and tube fittings. They even remove the jet engines' 44 fan blades one by one, after numbering each one so they fit back in perfect balance. As maintainers work inside a wheel well, a laptop sits atop one of the jet's landing gear so the airmen can check schematics and find out which parts they can fix themselves and which require permission from someone higher up. While the wing command sends at least a few maintainers overseas to keep planes flying in a war zone, there is some work that can be performed only at MacDill. This 900-hour inspection is one of those jobs. It is expected to take two shifts of 12 people each about a week to complete. There is an even more thorough 1,800-hour inspection that takes nearly three weeks. It can be arduous, dangerous work. "Almost everything we do is dangerous," said Lt. Col. Leah Vanagas, commander of the 6th Maintenance Squadron. "Of course, these are flying gas stations." Repairing the problem that led a crew to shut down one of the Stratotanker's engines in December is a good example of the dangers, Vanagas said. The suspected problem: Specialized coating on a wing fuel tank came loose, clogging up the engine. The inspections took three months of crews working 12-hour shifts. At one point, one of the airman's breathing masks failed and he had to be quickly extricated from the tight confines of the Stratotanker's wing tank because of deadly fumes. • • • The KC-135 Stratotanker was made by Boeing, based on the manufacturer's 707 civilian airliner. There are 414 in the inventory, and they are expected to continue delivering fuel, evacuating the injured and carrying cargo until about 2050. That's when they are all scheduled to be replaced by the new KC-46 Pegasus and future airframes still in the concept phase. In addition to the current roster of 16 jets, MacDill will begin receiving eight additional Stratotankers starting this year and is in the running for another dozen. Keeping them flying is a complicated juggling act, moving aircraft, crews and parts around the world while ensuring they are safe and able to perform missions. "We've been at it for 15 years," Vanagas, the squadron commander, said of the frantic pace of operations. "It's been very busy and it won't be ending any time soon."
