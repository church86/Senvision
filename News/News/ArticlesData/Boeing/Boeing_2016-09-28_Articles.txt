While U.S. elites were denouncing Donald Trump as unfit to serve for having compared Miss Universe 1996 to “Miss Piggy” of “The Muppets,” the World Trade Organization was validating the principal plank of his platform. America’s allies are cheating and robbing her blind on trade. According to the WTO, Britain, France, Spain, Germany and the EU pumped $22 billion in illegal subsidies into Airbus to swindle Boeing out of the sale of 375 commercial jets. Subsidies to the A320 caused lost sales of 271 Boeing 737s, writes journalist Alan Boyle. Subsidies for planes in the twin-aisle market cost the sale of 50 Boeing 767s, 777s and 787s. And subsidies to the A380 cost Boeing the sale of 54 747s.These represent crippling losses for Boeing, a crown jewel of U.S. manufacturing and a critical component of our national defense. Earlier, writes Boyle, the WTO ruled that, “without the subsidies, Airbus would not have existed … and there would be no Airbus aircraft on the market.” In “The Great Betrayal” in 1998, I noted that in its first 25 years the socialist cartel called Airbus Industrie “sold 770 planes to 102 airlines but did not make a penny of profit.” Richard Evans of British Aerospace explained: “Airbus is going to attack the Americans, including Boeing, until they bleed and scream.” And another executive said, “If Airbus has to give away planes, we will do it.” When Europe’s taxpayers objected to the $26 billion in subsidies Airbus had gotten by 1990, German aerospace coordinator Erich Riedl was dismissive: “We don’t care about criticism from small-minded pencil-pushers.” This is the voice of economic nationalism. Where is ours? After this latest WTO ruling validating Boeing’s claims against Airbus, the Financial Times is babbling of the need for “free and fair” trade, warning against a trade war. But is “trade war” not a fair description of what our NATO allies have been doing to us by subsidizing the cartel that helped bring down Lockheed and McDonnell-Douglas and now seeks to bring down Boeing? Our companies built the planes that saved Europe in World War II and sheltered her in the Cold War. And Europe has been trying to kill those American companies. Yet even as Europeans collude and cheat to capture America’s markets in passenger jets, Boeing itself, wrote Eamonn Fingleton in 2014, has been “consciously cooperating in its own demise.” By Boeing’s own figures, writes Fingleton, in the building of its 787 Dreamliner, the world’s most advanced commercial jet, the “Japanese account for a stunning 35 percent of the 787’s overall manufacture, and that may be an underestimate.” “Much of the rest of the plane is also made abroad … in Italy, Germany, South Korea, France, and the United Kingdom.” The Dreamliner “flies on Mitsubishi wings. These are no ordinary wings: they constitute the first extensive use of carbon fiber in the wings of a full-size passenger plane. In the view of many experts, by outsourcing the wings Boeing has crossed a red line.” Mitsubishi, recall, built the Zero, the premier fighter plane in the Pacific in the early years of World War II. In a related matter, the U.S. merchandise trade deficit in July and August approached $60 billion each month, heading for a trade deficit in goods in 2016 of another $700 billion. For an advanced economy like the United States, such deficits are milestones of national decline. We have been running them now for 40 years. But in the era of U.S. economic supremacy from 1870 to 1970, we always ran an annual trade surplus, selling far more abroad than Americans bought from abroad. In the U.S. trade picture, even in the darkest of times, the brightest of categories has been commercial aircraft. But to watch how we allow NATO allies we defend and protect getting away with decades of colluding and cheating, and then to watch Boeing transfer technology and outsource critical manufacturing to rivals like Japan, one must conclude that not only is the industrial decline of the United States inevitable, but America’s elites do not care. As for our corporate chieftains, they seem accepting of what is coming when they are gone, so long as the salary increases, stock prices and options, severance packages, and profits remain high. By increasingly relying upon foreign nations for our national needs, and by outsourcing production, we are outsourcing America’s future. After Munich in 1938, Neville Chamberlain and Lord Halifax visited Italy to wean Mussolini away from Hitler. The Italian dictator observed his guests closely and remarked to his foreign minister: “These men are not made of the same stuff as the Francis Drakes and the other magnificent adventurers who created the empire. These, after all, are the tired sons of a long line of rich men, and they will lose their empire.” If the present regime is not replaced, something like that will be said of this generation of Americans.

Resend activation e-mail Scientific Method / Science & Exploration NASA officials mulling the possibility of purchasing Soyuz seats for 2019 Congress, which recently has fully funded the private program, will be displeased. by Eric Berger - Sep 29, 2016 10:40 pm UTC Login to bookmark 51 Johnson Space Center Director Ellen Ochoa and NASA Administrator Charles Bolden are seated inside a mock-up of Boeing's Starliner spacecraft. Chris Ferguson, of Boeing, describes the interior of the spacecraft. NASA Senior managers in NASA’s International Space Station program have begun internal discussions about the possibility of buying additional Soyuz seats for US astronauts in 2019, two sources have told Ars. Although any final decision will likely come after the presidential election, the issue is “on people’s minds” at Johnson Space Center as confidence in operational commercial crew flights beginning from US soil by or before 2019 is shaky. Ars understands that NASA has not formally broached the topic with Roscosmos, the Russian space agency which builds the Soyuz spacecraft and rockets and manages their launches from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan. Negotiations would need to begin fairly soon, however, as it typically takes as long as three years of lead time for the Russians to manufacture additional launch vehicles. Uncertainty in the production timelines for Boeing and SpaceX, which are both developing capsules to carry humans to the space station, has driven contingency discussions about additional seats at the Houston-based space center. Publicly, NASA has maintained the hope that at least one private vehicle would be capable of operational missions by the end of 2017 or early 2018. Boeing has already slipped its schedule into early 2018, however. SpaceX has maintained the possibility of a later 2017 launch date, but with its recent accident, delays seem inevitable. Privately, NASA planners are concerned about additional delays that might slip those schedules further, into 2019. On Thursday, the director of Johnson Space Center, Ellen Ochoa, expressed optimism but not certainty about the private company timelines. “We think it’s very doable to have it in 2018, but you’re always just month to month with the progress,” the former astronaut told Ars. Asked about the SpaceX accident, she added, “It’s really hard to say what that impact will be. I would just say both companies are extremely committed. They are working well with us.” A politically painful decision A decision to buy seats almost certainly won’t be made until December or later, because such an action would be politically painful for the space agency. While it is true that Congress and the President agreed to retire the space shuttle after its final flight in 2011, no one in Washington DC was happy with the gap in US human spaceflight capabilities after the shuttle’s end During the first half of this decade, Congress exacerbated this gap by under-funding the commercial crew program, in which NASA gave contracts to several companies for crew transport spacecraft that were significantly cheaper than NASA could have developed. The lower-than-requested funding, totaling more than $1 billion over the course of several years, led to delays in initial flights from 2015 to 2017. But since NASA down-selected to just Boeing and SpaceX in September 2014, Congress has increased its funding level to more closely align with NASA’s requests. The agency’s own inspector general, Paul Martin, recently concluded that schedule delays beyond 2017 were due to technical challenges with the spacecraft’s design rather than funding issues. Hmm, we wonder why the price went up so much in 2010 and 2011. NASA Inspector General With that in mind, Congress will not be positively predisposed to funding requests for additional Russian seats, especially because the price keeps going up. Since the decision to retire the space shuttle in 2009, the Russian price for a seat has skyrocketed from about $30 million for a trip into orbit to $81.9 million for each of the six seats NASA bought for 2018. (This has led more than one aerospace insider to quip, “The Russians are the best capitalists of all.") It seems likely the price for any seats in 2019 would increase substantially, especially because NASA would be providing less than the three years of lead time as is customary for such orders. Trading seats Another wrinkle that NASA must contend with is how to handle trades for seats on commercial crew spacecraft after they begin flying. That is because when Boeing’s Starliner and SpaceX’s Dragon capsules launch from Florida, they will carry one Russian astronaut in addition to the NASA and any international partner astronauts on board. This is to ensure that every crew that goes to the station has representation of the two main partners, the United States and Russia. The way it works now is that there is an “A-line” Soyuz and, three months later, a “B-line” spacecraft, with a total of four launches a year. The A-line vehicle carries two Russians and one American, and the B-line vehicle typically has one NASA astronaut, one Russian, and one international partner. When the commercial crew vehicles begin flying, there will likely be a Soyuz launch, then a commercial vehicle, then a Soyuz, and so on. Essentially, a Starliner or Dragon will replace the B-line Soyuz now in the schedule. The wrinkle is that it has not been determined how NASA and Roscosmos will trade their seats. For example, one source familiar with the issue said it was unlikely that Russia would pay a comparable amount for a seat on a US commercial vehicle that NASA pays for Soyuz transport. (They might argue, for example, that the US vehicle is still in an experimental mode.) In any case, this may provide an additional point of negotiation—and Congressional consternation—if NASA decides it needs to purchase additional seats in 2019.

A nationwide realignment of military forces moved the jets to other bases, and the last of them flew out in 2009. The F-15s were built across the runways at McDonnell Douglas Corp., which became part of Boeing Co. Photo by Huy Mach, hmach@post-dispatch.com There are excellent defense and geostrategic arguments supporting the Obama administration’s approval of Boeing warplane sales to Kuwait and Qatar, but let’s be honest: For St. Louis, this boils down to economic stability and jobs — thousands of them. The St. Louis area has been in a holding pattern for the past two years, with the future of Boeing’s assembly plant in north St. Louis County in question as the company awaited approval of the two packages, with a total value of $7 billion. Qatar wants to buy 36 to 72 F-15 fighters, and Kuwait needs 28 F/A-18 Super Hornet attack jets. The two deals would keep the St. Louis plant churning at least into the early 2020s. The interaction between commerce here and events in the Persian Gulf region underscore why it’s important for our readers to keep abreast of world events. What happens over there truly matters here in tangible ways. We ignore developments in distant lands at our peril. Consider, for example, Boeing’s proposed $17.6 billion sale of 80 passenger jets to Iran. The very mention of Iran raises hackles for those concerned about Tehran’s nuclear program or those who still have fresh memories of Islamic Republic’s involvement in Middle Eastern upheaval since the late 1970s. State Sen. Eric Schmitt, a Glendale Republican who now is running for state treasurer, opposes the passenger jet sale and wants to punish Boeing by canceling tax breaks that help ensure the company doesn’t leave Missouri. Schmitt clearly wants to garner headlines and burnish his hardliner credentials. But the damage he seeks to inflict could have long-range, serious consequences. If Boeing doesn’t compete for this sale, Iran will almost certainly turn to Boeing’s competitor, Europe’s Airbus. It would help Iran replace a badly aging fleet of passenger jets that have gone poorly maintained after years of punishing international economic sanctions. This is a civilian safety issue. The Obama administration has negotiated a nuclear deal with Iran that, while imperfect, at least has delayed Iran’s ability to produce fissile material for several years. During that time, diplomacy and dialogue will be essential if there’s any hope of extending the nuclear agreement. The Boeing sale absolutely is a part of that diplomacy. Schmitt and his Republican cohorts are meddling in ways that promise to inflict far more damage than good. The Qatar and Kuwait sales underscore the long-term, beneficial effects from such deals. To keep these machines flying, both countries will need to ensure steady supplies of spare parts and maintenance expertise, which require U.S. government approval. That means both governments must maintain cooperative diplomatic ties with Washington. One relationship feeds off the other, increasing the likelihood that additional job-creating deals could come in the future. Schmitt must rethink this short-sighted political ploy.

Kuwait and Qatar requested the sale of the fighters two years ago, and while the US Congress approved of the deal, the White House has been dragging its feet. © AFP 2016/ FAYEZ NURELDINE US Government 'Turns a Corner' With Symbolic Senate Vote on Saudi Arms Deal On Wednesday, Senator Bob Corker, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, confirmed that the White House has, at last, signed off on the package. "I’m glad where we’ve gotten to the point where the notification is coming to Congress. We’ve been pushing for it for some time," he said, according to Defense News. As part of the deal, Qatar will reportedly receive 72 of Boeing’s F-15E fighters, worth approximately $4 billion. Kuwait will purchase 28 Boeing Super Hornets, with an option for 12 more, in a deal worth $3 billion. Bahrain will receive Lockheed Martin’s F-16s. Had the deal not gone through, the F-15 production line would have been halted. © AFP 2016/ GIL COHEN-MAGEN Israel Searching for New Allies Despite Record Military Aid Package From US "In my opinion our national interest is being served by pursuing these sales; That always comes first, but a by-product of that is we are keeping production lines functioning in case we need to utilize those in the future," Corker said. "These countries are buying equipment that is interoperable with our equipment which gives us the opportunity to deal with crises as they occur." Part of the reason for the delay focused on Israeli objections. The United States is legally bound to ensure that Israel maintains a military edge in the region.

Qatar Airways is in the process of firming up the order, which it was due to have placed at July's Farnborough airshow, but which was delayed by the Qatari government in an effort to speed up U.S. approval for the fighter contract, one of the sources said. Bloomberg reported that the deal was for at least 30 Boeing 777 and 787 jets, valued at about $6.7 billion at list prices. Boeing declined to comment and Qatar Airways was not immediately available to comment. If the deal is finalized, it would give the Chicago-based planemaker a substantial sales boost amid a slump in widebody orders this year. It follows news on Wednesday that the United States had begun notifying lawmakers informally that it had approved the sales of 36 Boeing F-15 fighter jets to Qatar, valued at around $4 billion. The United States also approved the sale of fighters to Kuwait. The sales to both states had been pending for more than two years amid concerns raised by Israel, Washington's closest Middle East ally, that they could be used against it, and criticism of Qatar for alleged ties to armed Islamist groups. Qatar Airways Chief Executive Officer Akbar Al Baker said in August that the airline planned to make a major aircraft order to enable its network expansion plans. In July the airline also said it was in advanced talks to purchase up to 30 of Boeing's 737 narrowbody planes. Earlier in the year, Qatar Airways refused to accept three Airbus A320neo narrowbody jets, because of engine cooling issues. The airline has canceled its first A320neo delivery and said it must source alternate planes to meet demand. Engine maker Pratt & Whitney said in March it expected the cooling problem and other software issues to be fixed this year. Airbus is struggling to keep up with deliveries to Qatar Airways of the long-haul Airbus A350 planes. Those delays, combined with the A320neo problems, has put Qatar Airways at risk of posting a loss in the fiscal year that ends in March, Al Baker said in August. "Our relationship is very strained," Al Baker said in August. "What's happening at Airbus with the deliveries is seriously affecting our growth."

REUTERS/Jim Young/File PhotoMore (Reuters) - Boeing Co <BA.N> is close to clinching a large sale of widebody jetliners to Qatar Airways, a deal that moved closer with the recent U.S. approval of Boeing fighter jet sales to the Gulf nation, according to two people familiar with the situation. Qatar Airways is in the process of firming up the order, which it was due to have placed at July's Farnborough airshow, but which was delayed by the Qatari government in an effort to speed up U.S. approval for the fighter contract, one of the sources said. Bloomberg reported that the deal was for at least 30 Boeing 777 and 787 jets, valued at about $6.7 billion at list prices. Boeing declined to comment and Qatar Airways was not immediately available to comment. If the deal is finalized, it would give the Chicago-based planemaker a substantial sales boost amid a slump in widebody orders this year. It follows news on Wednesday that the United States had begun notifying lawmakers informally that it had approved the sales of 36 Boeing F-15 fighter jets to Qatar, valued at around $4 billion. The United States also approved the sale of fighters to Kuwait. The sales to both states had been pending for more than two years amid concerns raised by Israel, Washington's closest Middle East ally, that they could be used against it, and criticism of Qatar for alleged ties to armed Islamist groups. Qatar Airways Chief Executive Officer Akbar Al Baker said in August that the airline planned to make a major aircraft order to enable its network expansion plans. In July the airline also said it was in advanced talks to purchase up to 30 of Boeing's 737 narrowbody planes. Earlier in the year, Qatar Airways refused to accept three Airbus <AIR.PA> A320neo narrowbody jets, because of engine cooling issues. The airline has canceled its first A320neo delivery and said it must source alternate planes to meet demand. Engine maker Pratt & Whitney <UTX.N> said in March it expected the cooling problem and other software issues to be fixed this year. Airbus is struggling to keep up with deliveries to Qatar Airways of the long-haul Airbus A350 planes. Those delays, combined with the A320neo problems, has put Qatar Airways at risk of posting a loss in the fiscal year that ends in March, Al Baker said in August. "Our relationship is very strained," Al Baker said in August. "What's happening at Airbus with the deliveries is seriously affecting our growth."

BERLIN: The United States began notifying lawmakers that it has approved $7 billion in long-stalled sales of Boeing Co fighter jets to Kuwait and Qatar, and more than $1 billion in Lockheed Martin Corp jets to Bahrain, sources familiar with the decision said Wednesday. The sales had been pending for more than two years amid concerns raised by Israel, Washington’s closest Middle East ally, that arms sold to Gulf Arab states could be used against it, and criticism of Qatar for alleged ties to armed Islamist groups. US officials began notifying lawmakers informally about the sale of 36 Boeing F-15 fighter jets to Qatar valued at around $4 billion, and 28 F/A- 18E/F Super Hornets, plus options for 12 more, to Kuwait for around $3 billion, the sources said. They also told lawmakers about plans to sell 17 Lockheed F-16 fighter jets to Bahrain, plus upgrades of up to 20 additional aircraft. The deals will be formally announced once the 40-day informal notification process has ended. Then lawmakers will have 30 days to block the sales, although such action is rare. Reuters reported earlier this month that the US government was poised to approve the long-delayed sales to Kuwait and Qatar. The State Department said it could not comment on any ongoing government-to-government arms sales. Delays in the process had caused frustration among US defense officials and industry executives, who warned that Washington’s foot-dragging could cost them billions of dollars of business if buyers grew impatient and sought other suppliers. The approval of the fighter jet sales comes as the White House tries to bolster relations with Gulf Arab allies who want to upgrade their military capabilities. They fear the United States is drawing closer to Iran, their arch-rival, after Tehran’s nuclear deal with world powers last year. Sources said officials at both the State Department and Pentagon had largely agreed to the deals some time ago, but had been awaiting final approval from the White House. Both Kuwait and Qatar are part of a 34- nation alliance announced by Saudi Arabia in December aimed at countering Islamic State and al Qaeda militants in Iraq, Syria, Libya, Egypt and Afghanistan. The sales will boost fighter production for both companies. Boeing’s F-15 line is set to close in 2019 after Boeing completes work on a large order for Saudi Arabia, unless a follow-on order is approved. As orders slow, Boeing is increasingly relying on technology upgrades and services sales to maintain its revenue stream from fighter jets, Shelley Lavender, president of Boeing’s military aircraft division, said in an interview. The company is adding new technology to the F-15 and F/A-18 and other aircraft, and is refurbishing them on the same assembly lines use to build new aircraft, she said. When the current fighter jet lines end, that loss of revenue will be offset by upgrade efforts. “We’re blurring the traditional lines of new aircraft builds and sustainment,” Lavender said. Boeing’s broad portfolio from commercial derivatives rotocraft, autonomous vehicles, fighters and weapons “will allow us to remain healthy for the decades to come,” she said. Byron Callan with Capital Alpha Partner said he expected all three sales to be approved. —Reuters Share This article was published on 29/09/2016 Most Read Rain expected till end of month Number of Indian nationals in Kuwait reaches 921,666 Govt eyes taxing remittances, privatizing hospitals, schools Anti-expat sentiments on the rise; Interior plans to fines and fees 8-hour ban on travelers return overruled Are our ideals ideal?

It’s easy to do their training here.” The Galveston County Daily News (http://bit.ly/2cE4re8 ) reports Boeing is one of two companies — SpaceX is the other — contracted by NASA in the final part of its commercial crew program, which will allow the United States to again launch people and material into space. Advertisement Continue reading NASA in 2014 awarded Boeing a $4.2 billion contract to develop the Starliner. Once completed, it will allow the United States to return to the International Space Station for the first time since 2011, when the space shuttle was retired. NASA has had to rely on Russian rockets and private contractors to deliver crews and cargo to the space station since then. “This is a big project for Boeing,” commercial crew program Deputy Manager Chris Ferguson said. “We don’t just handle the product, but we are also in charge of training the astronauts as well.” In addition to the contract to develop the Starliner, Boeing also received a $1.18 billion contract last year to fund its Space Training, Analysis and Review (STAR) facility, which opened June 21 at Boeing’s facility about 4 miles from the JSC. Boeing Space Exploration is based in the Clear Lake area and employs about 3,800 people across the state. The training installations at the JSC — which include “part-task” crew trainers, an instructor operation station suite and a cloud-based simulation server — are the most current milestone reached by Boeing on the way to developing the Starliner spacecraft. “It’s a big milestone,” Ferguson said. “But we are also working on software developments and some of the final drops are taking place. Little things need cleaning up, but the big bones are in place.” Included with several other training devices still under development by Boeing, these installations will be used to train Starliner crews and mission controllers for flights to low-Earth orbit, according to a news release. Advertisement Continue reading The part-task trainers, are meant to replicate various phases of the mission and flight to help prepare the astronauts, according to Boeing. “(They) are convenient for us in being able to start and stop the simulation at different parts,” astronaut Bob Behnken said during a simulation. “It lets us repeat things and try out different scenarios until the data is locked in our brains. “It’s nice not to have to have such a large support team each time. We will be able to run more simulations with a limited staff.” Where the part-task trainers are meant to instruct crew members on mission phases, the instructor operator station suite is where controllers and instructors “will monitor flight crew and controller performance, introduce malfunctions and measure trainee responses.” “The base of the cloud-based server allows us to do four simulations at once,” Pete Meisinger, program manager for the Boeing space vehicle training program, said. Still in development, the Boeing Mission Simulator will be the “full-scale, high-fidelity simulator allowing astronauts to practice all aspects of the mission,” according to Boeing. “The structure will look like the CST-100 Starliner,” Meisinger said. “The interior is full-fidelity and has the actual controls and control displays in the spacecraft. If the part-task trainers are the batting cages, then this is getting on the practice field.” Boeing hopes to have the Boeing Mission Simulator ready in the early months of 2017, Meisinger said. Advertisement Continue reading After the installation of the mission simulator in 2017, Boeing looks to install a mock-up trainer in Building 9 at JSC with a delivery target of February to March of 2017. “That will give us the most high-fidelity environment possible,” Meisinger said. Alongside the installation of the training devices, Boeing is working to accomplish other milestones for a scheduled crew test flight in 2018. “I think it’s doable in 2018, but we also recognize this is month-to-month,” Ochoa said. “This is one more milestone in a long list to accomplish on the way to the launch.” Ultimately, the goal of the Starliner goes beyond the NASA partnership into what Boeing hopes will be further commercial development in low-Earth orbit. “NASA is the flightship customer,” Ferguson said. “After that, it will be largely market-driven, but there are three big possibilities. One is space tourism; two is manufacturing in low-Earth orbit, and the third is finding a country interested in having a program for low-Earth orbit, but doesn’t want to develop the infrastructure.” The Starliner will be able to carry up to seven crew members or a mixture of personnel and cargo. It will be reusable up to 10 times. ___ Information from: The Galveston County Daily News, http://www.galvnews.com This is an AP Member Exchange shared by The Galveston County Daily News Share Tweet LinkedIn Print Subscribe Around the Region Suggested Stories: Boeing, SpaceX to transport NASA astronauts – Sep 17, 2014 Bezos' space company to build, launch rockets in Florida – Sep 15, 2015 5 years after shuttle, NASA awaits commercial crew capsules – Jul 20, 2016 How Obama brought capitalism to outer space – Oct 11, 2016 Advertisement Comments Subscribe to the Journal for only $12.

Facts 2016-09-29T14:47+02:00 14:47 29.09.2016 SBU calls intl report on investigation into Malaysian Boeing crash 'sentence to Russia' The results of the investigation conducted by the international investigation commission into the crash of the Malaysian Boeing in Donbas in July 2014 play an important role in determining those responsible for the tragedy, Vasyl Hrytsak, head of the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU), has said. "The tentative conclusions drawn by the Joint Investigation Team on the Boeing downed by Russian aggressors were published yesterday [...]. All people can now judge whether Russia is an aggressor or not. Even tentative investigation data can serve as a sentence to the Russian side," Hrytsak told reporters in Kyiv on Thursday. The Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777 Flight MH17 en route from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur was shot down in the airspace over Donetsk region on July 17, 2014. All 298 people on board were killed. The Joint Investigation Team (JIT), comprising prosecutors and representatives of other law enforcement agencies of Ukraine, the Netherlands, Belgium, Australia and Malaysia, and also representatives of Eurojust, was created on August 7, 2014. The first results of the criminal investigation into the MH17 crash were presented in the Netherlands on September 28, 2016. According to the Joint Investigation Team, the Boeing 777 Flight MH17 operated by Malaysia Airlines was downed by a 9M38 missile of a Buk anti-aircraft missile complex, launched from the Pervomaisk district in Donbas, six kilometers south of the Snizhne populated area which was controlled at the time by Donbas militants. Investigators noted that the missile complex had been brought to eastern Ukraine from Russia and later sent back to Russia. Russian experts said on the day that they find it incorrect that there is no technical investigation into the presentation by the international investigative team on the Malaysian Boeing crash in Donbas. Mikhail Malyshevsky, adviser to the main constructor at Almaz-Antey, said the crash of the Malaysian Boeing in Donbas could have been caused by a missile of an old modification of a Buk system fired from an area controlled by the Ukrainian military. Russian presidential press officer Dmitry Peskov, for his part, said the report by the international investigation group investigating the Boeing 777 crash in Ukraine on July 17, 2014 cannot be regarded as "the final truth." Alexander Zakharchenko, head of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic (DPR), told reporters on Thursday that the militants did not down the Malaysian Boeing.

The new maritime patrol aircraft is based on Boeing’s 737-800 fuselage, and will replace a fleet of AP-3C Orion aircraft currently in service with RAAF. The Orion aircraft is based at RAAF Base Edinburgh and will be replaced over the next three years. RAAF chief air marshal Leo Davies said: “The P-8A is the latest in a pedigree of Boeing aircraft that have provided important and significant operational capability to Australia. “This history includes the C-17A Globemaster, E-7A Wedgetail, F/A-18 Classic Hornet, F/A-18F Super Hornet, Helicopter Aircrew Training System and in the near future E/A-18G Growler.” The P-8A is equipped with weapons bay, under wing and under fuselage hard points for weapons and is designed for continued low level operations and high angle of bank turns. "The P-8A is the latest in a pedigree of Boeing aircraft that have provided important and significant operational capability to Australia." The first aircraft will arrive in Australia on 15 November, with the remaining 11 aircraft to be delivered by March 2020, RAAF said in a statement. Aircrew and maintenance personnel for the P-8A are being trained since early 2015 by working alongside the US Navy at Naval Air Station Jacksonville, Florida. The first P-8A Australian pilot flew a four-hour sortie on 14 April 2015. The aircraft is capable of conducting long-range anti-submarine and anti-surface warfare, along with intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance missions. It can also be used for broad-area maritime and littoral operations. Image: A P-8A Poseidon flying alongside a Lockheed P-3 Orion. Photo: courtesy of US Navy photo by Liz Goettee.

WestJet at Gatwick: WestJet expands its long haul service despite competitor pressure CAPA > Aviation Analysis > WestJet at Gatwick: WestJet expands its long haul service despite competitor pressure 27-Sep-2016 Tweet © CAPA Attempts by WestJet’s competitors to flood the London market with capacity in order to undermine the low cost airline’s widebody experiment in the London Gatwick market have not produced the end result of driving WestJet from the trans-Atlantic space. WestJet is sending a clear message to its competitors that it plans to remain firmly entrenched on long haul routes. The company is currently examining options for more widebody aircraft, and is discussing further long haul expansion with its pilots. After a rocky start to its highly anticipated long haul service to London, WestJet is posting load factors on its routes to Gatwick that are higher than system average, and concludes that the flights are delivering positive returns. An interesting pattern in WestJet’s passenger composition on the company’s trans-Atlantic service to Gatwick is the number of US-originating passengers from large metropolitan areas that currently have nonstop service to London – a dynamic that the airline attributes to its lower fares. The US-originating customers are boosting WestJet’s sixth freedom traffic flowing over Canada to long haul destinations. WestJet seeks compensation over mechanical mishaps with Boeing 767 widebodies In May-2016 WestJet became the first North America-based low cost airline to broaden the low cost model on long haul flights across the Atlantic. The company added used Boeing 767s to the fleet for the launch of year-round flights from Calgary and Toronto to London Gatwick, and seasonal service from Vancouver, St John’s, Edmonton and Winnipeg to Gatwick. WestJet operates four Boeing 767 widebodies on the route in a 262-seat configuration – 24 “Plus” reclining seats and 238 economy seats. WestJet charges for meals, checked bags and seat selection on the flights.

The company’s trans-Atlantic debut was marred by operational disruptions stemming from aircraft mechanical problems, and shortly after the problems occurred WestJet declared that the issues were creating grief for the airline. See related report: WestJet’s 767 operational problems cloud a significant low cost long haul opportunity Recently WestJet CEO Gregg Saretsky offered some insight into the mechanical problems to investors, stressing that the challenges had nothing to do with the company’s organisational capability, “and everything to do with the health of the aircraft we received”. Under WestJet’s arrangement it acquired the aircraft from Boeing, who purchased the jets from Qantas. Boeing’s responsibilities included repainting, reconfiguring and refurbishing the aircraft interiors, and providing a clean bill of health for the aircraft, said Mr Saretsky. Problems alledgedly occurred with the maintenance, repair and overhaul company selected by Boeing to perform the work on the 767s. Mr Saretsky stated that WestJet was receiving the aircraft anywhere from 50 to 120 days late and the first jet had more than 200 snags – but none of the issues had compromised safety of flight, he explained. It took WestJet two months to smooth out the mechanical issues, and during that time the airline hired Omni Air International to operate services when the 767s needed repairs. Mr Saretsky declared that WestJet was holding discussions with both Boeing and the MRO provider for the additional expense that “we incurred as a result of the poor workmanship”. Previously WestJet has cited pressure in its unit costs excluding fuel for 2016, created by the expenses associated with the irregular 767 operations, which included using a third party contractor and compensating passengers for delayed flights. The company now expects its unit costs to increase 2.5% to 3.5% versus previous estimates of an increase ranging from 0.5% to 2.5%. See related report: WestJet’s positive unit revenue trend. 2016 still challenging for airlines, but investors encouraged At the high point of WestJet’s maintenance challenges with the 767s a lot of attention was placed on the age of the aircraft, which for WestJet averages 24 years. Mr Saretsky was quick to dismiss any concerns about the age of its widebody jets, noting that American, Air Canada, Delta, British Airways and KLM all reliably operate 767s of the same vintage. WestJet posts positive results in the Atlantic, despite competitive capacity additions Prior to launching its London Gatwick flights WestJet faced some investor trepidation about its long haul plans, given Canada’s tenuous economic environment driven by weakness in the country’s Western provinces due to the downturn in the oil business. WestJet took great care to stress that the 767 operations were a low-risk exercise; Mr Saretsky characterised the new flights as “almost a throw-away experiment” to see if the markets made sense. See related report: Canada’s airlines Part 2: WestJet stays the course as capacity growth dampens its stock price Mr Saretsky then recently expressed some regret over characterising the 767 operations as an experiment, explaining that it had triggered competitors to do “silly things”, including adding significant capacity in the market. WestJet’s main rival Air Canada did not sit idly by as the low cost airline entered the lucrative trans-Atlantic market with nonstop flights. Air Canada reacted by introducing its own flights to London Gatwick (it serves London Heathrow from several Canadian airports) through its low cost subsidiary rouge. Data from CAPA and OAG show that overall in early Jul-2016 seats between Canada and the UK grew 15% year-on-year, with Air Canada posting 6% growth. British Airways’ seat numbers fell slightly in that period, and Air Transat’s seats increased approximately 4%. Canada to United Kingdom (seats per week, one way): 23-Sep-2013 to 13-Mar-2017 Source: CAPA - Centre for Aviation and OAG Mr Saretsky stated that WestJet’s returns across the Atlantic would be better without the excess capacity; however, the company was happy with the performance of those routes, which have met the company’s goals of being accretive in year one. WestJet attracts US sixth freedom traffic on long haul flights due to its lower fares One observation Mr Saretsky offered regarding the new service is that many passengers on the Gatwick flights originated in the US, in larger metropolitan areas including Boston, Phoenix, Newark, Los Angeles and San Francisco that feature nonstop service to London. The stopovers for those passengers in Canada are driven by WestJet’s lower fares in the markets, and Mr Saretsky cited the benefits of the incremental transborder passengers at a time “when the weaker Canadian dollar is creating headwinds for us”. Although WestJet is enjoying a boost from sixth freedom traffic for its nonstop trans-Atlantic service from the US, it has no feed for beyond flights from London Gatwick. The airline approached British Airways about extending their current codeshare to cover flights beyond Gatwick but British Airways declined WestJet’s offer. As a result, WestJet has decided to end its codeshare with British Airways in Oct-2016 – the agreement covers WestJet’s flights to Canada’s interior beyond the country’s gateways. The dissolution of the codeshare is an interesting by-product of WestJet’s trans-Atlantic expansion, but it has not deterred WestJet from plotting further growth across the Atlantic; nor has the airline been deterred by the additional capacity ushered in by its competitors to quash WestJet’s trans-Atlantic experiment. WestJet declares its intent to remain in the long haul space; competition remains fierce Mr Saretsky has stated that WestJet is in the market looking for additional widebodies to operate further international expansion, and is also holding discussions with its pilots in order to facilitate that growth. WestJet is drawing a line in the sand, stressing that its foray into the nonstop long-haul trans-Atlantic market has moved far beyond the experimental stage. The airline is staking a claim in a market it can hardly walk away from if it wants to reach and maintain its return targets over the long term. During the decades-long duopoly that WestJet has held with Air Canada in Canada’s domestic market WestJet has survived heightened competition with its larger rival. Now WestJet consistently needs to prove that it can handle attacks from its familiar rival in the long haul space. Want more analysis like this?

Mechanical problems with the Boeing 767s have triggered cancellations and operational challenges, which has created passenger frustration, and resulted in reaccommodation and other expenses that are not insignificant. WestJet has been working to smooth out the operational teething pains of the twin aisle jets, and is assuring that the hiccups are temporary. However, the less than ideal launch could call into question WestJet’s ability to spread the low cost model and stimulate traffic from Canada in the North Atlantic market. The company is attracting a higher level of scrutiny since it is the first LCC based in North America to attempt to spread the model on long haul flights. Despite the shaky launch of its long haul flights with widebodies, WestJet cannot ignore long-term opportunities presented by the long haul market from Canada – with a value in the billions. WestJet can ill-afford to cede all the revenue to rival Air Canada and non-Canadian airlines operating on trans-Atlantic routes. In the short term the airline finds itself in a position of now attempting to engender passenger confidence that its operational snafus are temporary, and its product proposition remains intact. jetBlue Airways, armed with its premium product Mint, is poised to disrupt the trans-Atlantic market 3-Oct-2016 Periodically throughout the last few years jetBlue has hinted that long haul trans-Atlantic flights could be a possibility at some point in its evolution. But in mid-2016 the company took a more concrete step towards serving trans-Atlantic routes by altering its Airbus order book – potentially to support long haul expansion. JetBlue’s decision to option the Airbus A321LR occurs at a time when airlines such as WestJet, Norwegian Air Shuttle and WOW Air are pushing the low cost model into the long haul international market. Perhaps the steps those airlines are taking to carve out the low cost niche in the long haul space has accelerated jetBlue’s evaluations of trans-Atlantic service. The company has declared that it would make a decision about its options for the long-range Airbus narrowbody in 2017 ahead of the narrowbody’s debut in 2019. The biggest drivers for jetBlue’s decision to enter the long haul trans-Atlantic market are identifying routes where it can inject low fares to stimulate traffic and drive revenue. The company’s base in Boston is emerging as the epicentre for those potential opportunities. © 2016 CAPA Centre for Aviation :: Contact Us :: Terms & Conditions :: Cookies & Privacy Policy :: Glossary :: Feedback :: All times are in AEST (GMT +11)

MH17 probe 'biased', Moscow 'disappointed': foreign ministry by Staff Writers Moscow (AFP) Sept 28, 2016 Malaysia PM vows justice after MH17 probe Kuala Lumpur (AFP) Sept 28, 2016 - Malaysia on Wednesday promised "firm action" against those behind the downing of Flight MH17 in Ukraine, after a Dutch-led enquiry found the plane was hit by a missile transported from Russia. The international criminal enquiry presented its findings into the crash of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17 in conflict-torn eastern Ukraine in July 2014, which killed all 298 people on board. "The Joint Investigation Team has concluded that MH17 was downed by a Russian-made missile and it was fired from rebel controlled territory," national news agency Bernama reported Prime Minister Najib Razak as saying. "Based on the two findings, Malaysia wants firm action to be taken. We have promised that those who were responsible for the downing of the aircraft will be brought to justice," he told Malaysian media during a trip to Germany. "We owe it to the families. The families want justice. So we will pursue this," he said. Malaysia will call for a meeting with representatives from other countries which lost citizens in the crash, notably the Netherlands and Australia, he said. The report did not assign blame but said the Boeing 777 was shot down by a BUK missile system from an area in eastern Ukraine controlled by pro-Russian separatists, and that the system was brought in from Russia and then taken back there. The dead included 44 Malaysians, along with 192 Dutch nationals and 27 Australians. Moscow on Wednesday described as "biased" and "politically motivated" the Dutch-led inquiry into the downing of Flight MH17 over eastern Ukraine, which concluded the plane was shot down by a missile transported from Russia. "Russia is disappointed that the situation around the investigation of the Boeing catastrophe is not changing," foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said in a statement. "The conclusions of Dutch prosecutors confirm that the investigation is biased and politically motivated," she said. She accused the Joint Investigative Taskforce of "arbitrarily designating a guilty party and inventing the desired results." The taskforce presented its findings on Wednesday after a two-year investigation into the crash of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 in conflict-torn eastern Ukraine, which killed all 298 people on board in July 2014. The conclusion did not assign blame but said the Boeing 777 was shot down by a BUK missile system from an area in eastern Ukraine controlled by pro-Russian separatists, and that the system was brought in from Russia and then taken back there. The ministry statement said the taskforce "excluded Moscow from fully participating in the investigation process" while embracing Ukraine as a "full member of the JIT" and giving Kiev an opportunity to "falsify evidence and twist the case in its favour". "Russia is practically the only (party) that sends true information and discloses more and more new data," the statement said. Yet the "whole 'body of evidence' of the Dutch prosecutors was provided by Ukraine," it said. The taskforce said Wednesday that Moscow had only provided part of the information that it had requested. Russia's defence ministry on Monday released what it claimed were new radar images showing that there was no missile fired from rebel-held territory on that day, which contradicted some of its earlier declarations. Russia's Almaz-Antey missile maker, which produces BUK surface-to-air systems, said in a briefing Wednesday that the inquiry did not include its findings. The state-controlled firm last October alleged the plane was downed from disputed territory by an outdated version of the BUK missile that is no longer in use by the Russian military. Dutch prosecutors said they only received Almaz-Antey's data this month and did not find that it outweighed the probe's conclusions. Points from the MH17 investigation Nieuwegein, Netherlands (AFP) Sept 28, 2016 - An international criminal inquiry into the 2014 downing of Flight MH17 over eastern Ukraine revealed Wednesday that a BUK missile which brought down the plane was transported from Russia. Here are the main findings of the inquiry carried out by the Joint Investigation team (JIT), led by Dutch prosecutors with teams from Australia, Belgium, Malaysia and Ukraine. - The weapon - The JIT said it has "irrefutable evidence to establish that on 17 July 2014, Flight MH17 was shot down by a BUK missile from the 9M38-series." Some 298 people were killed when the Malaysia Airlines plane on a routine flight from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur was blown out of the skies over eastern Ukraine. It made this determination by dismantling various types of BUK, a Russian-made ground-based air defence system, and comparing them to metal parts recovered from the crash site. Investigators also ruled out alternative scenarios that the disaster was caused by an accident or a terror attack. And according to radar data, no other planes were in the area which could have shot it down. - Where did the missile come from? - Using photos, videos and intercepted phone conversations, the investigators retraced the missile system's route which they say originated in Russia. "The system was transported from Russian territory into eastern Ukraine and was later transported on a white Volvo truck with a low-boy trailer. The truck was escorted by several other vehicles and by armed men in uniform," the inquiry concludes. An intercepted telephone conversation said to be between two Russian-speaking men fighting on the side of the separatists suggests the launcher crossed the border on the night between July 16 and 17. The wiretapped conversation intercepted on Wednesday, July 16, 2104 at 7:09 pm records one man, identified as Nikolayevich, saying he doesn't know if "his men can hold" and asking if he can "receive a BUK in the morning... that'd be good. If not things will go totally fucked up". "If you need ... we'll send it over to your area," the other man, called Sanych, replies. - The launch site - The final destination of the BUK-TELAR launch system was farmland near Pervomaiskyi. Investigators said that at the time the field was in rebel-held territory. Witnesses told the investigators they had seen "a plume of smoke, the BUK-TELAR at the launch site in Pervomaiskyi, and the missile right after it had been launched." Multiple witnesses had also photographed the condensation trail of the missile and its movement. "After the BUK missile had been fired, the BUK-TELAR initially drove off under its own power. A short time later it was reloaded onto the Volvo truck and transported back to the Russian border. During the night, the convoy crossed the border into the territory of the Russian Federation," the inquiry says. - The perpetrators - Investigators did not name any suspects, but revealed they have identified about 100 people "who can be linked to the downing of MH17 or the transport of the BUK-TELAR." It is also probing the chain of command, and has extended the investigation to January 2018. "Who gave the order to bring the BUK-TELAR into Ukraine and who gave the order to shoot down flight MH17? Did the crew decide for themselves or did they execute a command from their superiors? This is important when determining the offences committed by the alleged perpetrators," the inquiry states in its report. The JIT team has put a number of intercepted phone conversations on its website www.jitmh17.com and is asking people who recognise the voices to come forward with information.

US approves Boeing, Lockheed fighter jet sales to Gulf BERLIN, September 29, 2016 The US on Wednesday began notifying lawmakers that it has approved $7 billion in long-stalled sales of Boeing Co fighter jets to Kuwait and Qatar, and more than $1 billion in Lockheed Martin Corp jets to Bahrain, sources familiar with the decision said. The sales had been pending for more than two years amid concerns raised by Israel, Washington's closest Middle East ally, that arms sold to Gulf Arab states could be used against it, and criticism of Qatar for alleged ties to armed Islamist groups. US officials began notifying lawmakers informally about the sale of 36 Boeing F-15 fighter jets to Qatar valued at around $4 billion, and 28 F/A- 18E/F Super Hornets, plus options for 12 more, to Kuwait for around $3 billion, the sources said. They also told lawmakers about plans to sell 17 Lockheed F-16 fighter jets to Bahrain, plus upgrades of up to 20 additional aircraft. The deals will be formally announced once the 40-day informal notification process has ended. Then lawmakers will have 30 days to block the sales, although such action is rare. Reuters reported earlier this month that the US government was poised to approve the long-delayed sales to Kuwait and Qatar. The State Department said it could not comment on any ongoing government-to-government arms sales. Delays in the process had caused frustration among US defense officials and industry executives, who warned that Washington's foot-dragging could cost them billions of dollars of business if buyers grew impatient and sought other suppliers. The approval of the fighter jet sales comes as the White House tries to bolster relations with Gulf Arab allies who want to upgrade their military capabilities. They fear the United States is drawing closer to Iran, their arch-rival, after Tehran's nuclear deal with world powers last year. Sources said officials at both the State Department and Pentagon had largely agreed to the deals some time ago, but had been awaiting final approval from the White House. Qatar, home to the largest US air base in the Middle East, and Kuwait have ramped up military spending after uprisings across the Arab world and amid rising tensions between Sunni Muslim Gulf Arab states and Iran, the region's Shi'ite power. Both Qatar and Kuwait are part of a 34-nation alliance announced by Saudi Arabia in December aimed at countering Islamic State and al Qaeda militants in Iraq, Syria, Libya, Egypt and Afghanistan. The sales will boost fighter production for both companies. Boeing's F-15 line is set to close in 2019 after Boeing completes work on a large order for Saudi Arabia, unless a follow-on order is approved. As orders slow, Boeing is increasingly relying on technology upgrades and services sales to maintain its revenue stream from fighter jets, Shelley Lavender, president of Boeing's military aircraft division, said in an interview. The company is adding new technology to the F-15 and F/A-18 and other aircraft, and is refurbishing them on the same assembly lines use to build new aircraft, she said. When the current fighter jet lines end, that loss of revenue will be offset by upgrade efforts. "We're blurring the traditional lines of new aircraft builds and sustainment," Lavender said. Boeing's broad portfolio from commercial derivatives rotocraft, autonomous vehicles, fighters and weapons "will allow us to remain healthy for the decades to come," she said. Byron Callan with Capital Alpha Partner said he expected all three sales to be approved. – Reuters Tags: Gulf | Boeing | F-16 | Lockheed | fighter jets | More Miscellaneous Stories ADGB draws over 180 top UAE, international firms The Saudi Trade Finance Summit opens in Jeddah today Microsoft, CH9 partner to fuel business development in Bahrain 4 killed in suicide bombing at US base in Afghanistan Dubai Customs carries out over 3,000 seizures Saudi Prince Turki bin Abdulaziz passes away World Tea Coffee Expo draws over 3,400 visitors Anti-Trump protests spread across US, flag burnt Isis now using toxic chemical weapons Kanafani invests in Arab Advisors Group Online govt transactions top $5.25m in Bahrain On-demand expert marketplace expands to Mideast Dubai’s RTA to deliver disability cards 40 potential start-ups to pitch at Mena Angel Investors Summit Hellofood, Hungerstation merge UAE's food sector sales poised to top $16bn New law firm AS&H launched in Saudi Arabia Iraqi troops storm town near Mosul, thousands flee Bahrain issues directive on dual nationality Anghami raises funds to support regional expansion British MPs approval must for Brexit, says high court WOP Dubai to feature 15pc more exhibitors Battle for Mosul: Iraqi forces on city edge Calendar of Events View all events Tools Exchange Rates Weather Forecast BBC World Service Ads Sectors | Information | About Us | Construction & Real Estate Energy, Oil & Gas Finance & Capital Market Industry & Logistics IT & Telecommunication Health & Environment Motoring Retail & Wholesale Travel, Tourism & Hospitality Government & Laws Media & Promotion Back to top Trade News Newsletter Events Business Directory TradeArabia Network Advertising Contact Feedback Privacy Statement Terms of Service Web Feeds

Boeing jet deal means big boost for St. Louis jobs By Chuck Raasch St. Louis Post-Dispatch Chuck Raasch Sep 28, 2016 (…) Courtesy Boeing F/A-18E/F Super Hornets, in a photo provided by Boeing. WASHINGTON • The administration of President Barack Obama has approved $7 billion in long-stalled sales of Boeing Co. fighter jets to Kuwait and Qatar, a decision that could preserve thousands of jobs in the St. Louis area. The deal had been delayed for more than two years, amid concerns by Israel that the planes posed a threat to that nation’s security. But members of Missouri’s delegation had long touted the sale as a jobs boost for the St. Louis region, where F/A-18E/F Super Hornets and F-15 Eagles are produced. The Navy also is considering building an additional 14 or more Super Hornets to replace aging ones and add to the Pentagon’s strike-force capabilities, although funding for them has been caught in the ongoing debate over spending bills now stalled in Congress. Reuters reported earlier this month that the sale had essentially been approved and that the next step would be notifying members of Congress. U.S. Rep. Ann Wagner, R-Ballwin, was among lawmakers applauding the decision. The fighter jet sales, she said, “will help our allies located within a volatile region fight the growing threats of Islamic extremism.” “These jets are also critical to the St. Louis manufacturing base and support 5,000 families whose loved ones build these jets, as well as thousands of additional jobs across Missouri,” she said. “I am thrilled that this sale was approved, which will keep the Super Hornet production line in St. Louis running into 2020.” U.S. Rep. William Lacy Clay, D-St. Louis, agreed. “The administration’s approval of additional foreign sales of Boeing F-15 Eagles and Boeing F/A-18 Super Hornets will not only strengthen our Gulf allies, it will protect thousands of skilled manufacturing jobs in north St. Louis County and at Boeing suppliers across Missouri and Illinois,” Clay said in a statement. U.S. Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo., said via Twitter, “I’ve been proud to back the F-15 and F-18 programs and the thousands of jobs they support, and will continue to do so.” The sales were delayed amid concerns raised by Israel, Washington’s closest Middle East ally. U.S. officials have also criticized Qatar for alleged ties to armed Islamist groups. Earlier this month, the U.S. pledged to provide $38 billion in military assistance to Israel over the next decade, the largest such aid package in history. The state of Qatar requested to buy at least 36 of the F-15 air-superiority jets, and possibly 72. Boeing is busy building F-15s for Saudi Arabia, and those orders would keep production lines in north St. Louis County running into 2019. The Qatari orders, worth $4 billion, would extend that into the early 2020s. Kuwait had requested 28 F/A-18 Super Hornet attack jets, with an option for 12 more. Boeing has enough orders to keep that line running into 2018. The $3 billion Kuwaiti order, combined with orders requested by the Navy, would extend production into 2020.

Boeing has never specified the number employed on the fighter programs, but it reaches several thousand.

The sales will be announced formally once the informal 40-day congressional notification period has ended. Then lawmakers will have 30 days to block the sales, although such action is rare.

Share story By Katherine Long Seattle Times higher education reporter Boeing is giving $6 million to a wide-ranging group of nonprofits and education institutions throughout the state in an effort to boost tech training and skills. The company is aiming to reach a diverse group of high school and college students, many of whom historically haven’t pursued STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) education. In a phone interview Wednesday, Boeing CEO Ray Conner said the company wants to provide opportunities for tech jobs to a generation that’s growing more racially and ethnically diverse. “We’re trying to reach out to the population that has been a little bit underserved over the course of time,” he said.

Conner, a graduate of Highline High School in Burien and Central Washington University, said he hoped the grants would help better prepare Washington students for jobs at Boeing and other tech-centered companies in the region. “We talk about being a company that’s committed to the community, to our young people, and we want to put our money where our mouth is,” he said. The grants include $500,000 to the University of Washington to help underrepresented high school students plan their college careers, and be successful in school. It includes money to expand the Dream Project, an 11-year-old mentorship project started by a UW student that trains undergraduate UW students to help high-school students study for the SAT, apply for college and secure financial aid. Another $250,000 will go to Washington State University’s Everett campus, WSU North Puget Sound, to build a state-of-the-art lab space in the university’s new building that opens in about a year. The 900-square-foot lab will include a 3D printer and scanner, computer-controlled machining mill and laser cutter, and will be known as the Boeing Innovation Studio. And $250,000 will go to Seattle University’s College of Science and Engineering, to improve retention rates of nontraditional students in undergraduate engineering and computer science. In all, 50 institutions and nonprofits will receive money from the grants. Among the major recipients are Thrive Washington, which focuses on early learning; Washington STEM, which works with K-12 schools; and SkillUp Washington, which works with community and technical colleges. Some grants are so small as to be experimental in nature, and are meant to encourage new and different ideas, a Boeing spokesman said. Conner said he hopes the programs supported by the grants will give students “more of a near-term vision of what they could do right away” after graduating from high school or college. About half of Boeing’s technical workforce will be eligible for retirement in the next five to seven years. Boeing has 77,000 workers in Washington state, so it will need to fill tens of thousands of jobs in the coming years. “We don’t want to go anywhere else to make that happen,” Conner said. “That would be a real failure.” Katherine Long: 206-464-2219 or klong@seattletimes.com.

(AP Photo/Bob Edme) A dozen years after the U.S. first dragged the European Union to the WTO, the trade body ruled Thursday the EU hasn’t done enough to remedy the harm done by Airbus subsidies. Boeing declared victory while Airbus scoffed. Share story By Dominic Gates Seattle Times aerospace reporter A World Trade Organization (WTO) compliance panel ruled Thursday that the European Union has fallen dramatically short of remedying the harm to Boeing from illegal subsidies to Airbus. The decision opens a path for the U.S. to implement trade sanctions against the EU — potentially imposing billions of dollars in tariffs on its goods or services. In an early-morning news teleconference, the U.S. Trade Representative, Ambassador Michael Froman, called the ruling “a sweeping victory for the United States and its aerospace workers.” “We will not tolerate our trading partners, even our closest trading partners, ignoring the rules at the expense of American workers,” Froman said.

Yet Airbus officials and some independent analysts shrugged off the ruling as another empty step in a tortuous proceeding that’s going nowhere — very slowly. It’s now more than a dozen years since the U.S. first dragged the European Union (EU) before the WTO dispute-settlement panel, and the EU will almost certainly appeal the new ruling. Scott Hamilton, Bainbridge Island-based aviation expert with Leeham.net, said he would be “shocked if tariffs are imposed on any Airbus or Boeing products and it would be stupid to impose tariffs against unrelated industries.” Still, Ted Austell, Boeing vice president for trade issues, declared the ruling a comprehensive legal beating for Airbus. He summarized the WTO report as saying “the EU and Airbus did essentially nothing at all to come into compliance” after the trade organization found the European jet maker had received illegal subsidies from France, Germany, the U.K. and Spain. The subsidies came largely in the form of “launch aid” — upfront loans to fund Airbus’ development of new jet programs. Boeing says Airbus used about $15 billion in launch aid to develop all its planes up to the A380 superjumbo, plus about $2 billion in other subsidies. In 2010, the WTO ruled those loans illegal because the European governments gave Airbus the money on highly favorable, noncommercial terms. In a surprise step, Thursday’s WTO ruling also declared illegal nearly $5 billion in additional government loans that Airbus used to launch its latest jet, the A350, which competes with Boeing’s 787 and 777 airplanes. Though those loans were granted after the U.S. filed its original case, the WTO decided they should be covered by the same ruling. “It is apparent that the A350XWB could not have been launched and brought to market in the absence of launch aid,” the WTO report said. In assessing the competitive harm done, the report said that, as a result of the Airbus launch aid, Boeing lost 50 orders in the 787/777 large-aircraft category, 54 in the 747 very-large jet category and 271 in the 737 narrowbody-jet category. Airbus reacts In a statement, Boeing Chairman and Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg said the ruling “finally holds the EU and Airbus to account for their flouting of global trade rules.” In response, Airbus Chief Executive Tom Enders said Muilenburg “should be careful throwing stones at us while he himself sits in a glass house.” “Boeing might later be hit by a rock when the next WTO ruling comes,” Enders added, referring to the EU’s parallel countersuit against Boeing. In an email after the U.S. Trade Representative’s news conference, Airbus Senior Vice President Rainer Ohler derided the WTO process as “pathetic,” saying it has so far produced no material result for Boeing. He said “only tiny tweaks” will be required to make the A350 launch-aid terms compliant with WTO rules. Ohler praised the European “public-private partnership model,” based on providing reimbursable loans, as “stronger than ever.” In contrast, he was cynical about the U.S. alternative of government funding. He characterized Boeing as tapping “the U.S. military-industrial complex” for money. Ohler also mocked the Boeing 787 as a “subsidy-liner” and said the U.S. jet maker “has laid the biggest egg in subsidy history” with the $8.7 billion in tax breaks for the 777X from the state of Washington. Protracted procedures Inescapably, though, Thursday’s ruling zeroed in on the Airbus subsidies. It has been six years since the world trade body ruled that European government subsidies to Airbus were illegal. A year later, an appeals panel reduced the charges somewhat, but retained major findings against Airbus and required the EU to remedy the harm done to Boeing. The new report undercut the European claim that only “limited changes” in its practices will suffice to fix its funding model. Only two of 36 actions Airbus took toward meeting its WTO obligations qualified as steps toward compliance, the report said. Austell, of Boeing, pointed to the Airbus A380 program as a clear example of how launch aid distorts the market. The A380 program faces potential closure unless the jet maker gets significant new orders in the next couple of years — a situation Boeing also faces with the 747. If the A380 is terminated, Austell said, Airbus’ ability to walk away from its launch-aid loans on that program without fully repaying them is an unacceptable advantage. “Programs like the A380 need to have a commercial consequence,” he said. “The last thing we want is for Airbus to pirouette away from that loan obligation … and have no economic consequence on the balance sheet.” Countersuit vs. Boeing Meanwhile, a countersuit the EU brought against U.S. for subsidies to Boeing is moving in parallel. In that case, the WTO ruled five years ago that a much lower level of Boeing subsidies were also illegal. Boeing was found guilty of receiving about $2.7 billion in subsidies, including NASA research grants and state subsidies such as the 2003 tax breaks granted by the state of Washington. However, the EU filed that suit more than a year after the U.S. filed its case against Airbus, and its outcome is still lagging. A ruling on U.S. compliance with the remedies demanded in that ruling is expected by next spring. Bob Novick, former general counsel to the U.S. Trade Representative during President Clinton’s administration, insisted the two cases are as comparable as an elephant is to a mouse. Novick, now a managing partner at Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale & Dorr and outside counsel to Boeing on the WTO dispute, argued that the impact of those subsidies is tiny compared with the impact of the billions Airbus received upfront every time it developed a new plane. “The nature of launch aid, the effect it has had in allowing Airbus to build all of its airplanes, and the harm the WTO found it caused to Boeing are not matched by anything even alleged by the EU that the U.S. gave to Boeing,” Novick said. Trade war? Michael Lutting, Boeing executive vice president and general counsel, said that “whatever happens in the European cases against the United States,” Airbus needs to end its launch-aid programs. But a European source close to the Airbus case, who asked not to be identified, characterized the whole WTO process as a waste of time and money that will not produce any enforceable outcome. This person said Boeing has merely succeeded in proving the toothlessness of the WTO to the Chinese, the Russians and other competitors. He pointed out that Canada recently poured $2 billion directly into Montreal-based Bombardier’s new CSeries jet program, unafraid of any consequences at the WTO. Richard Aboulafia, aviation analyst with the Teal Group, agreed. “It’s a nice moral victory. It validates what Boeing has been saying. But how does it produce anything tangible?” he asked. “It won’t change much.” Leeham.net’s Hamilton was even more cynical. “Only the lawyers get rich,” he said. An Airbus spokeswoman said any appeal of the ruling will likely center on the narrow issue of whether the interest rates for its government loans correspond to commercial terms. “We are confident that we will win that point on appeal,” the spokeswoman said. “Whatever Boeing will say, nobody will have to go to the bank. There have never been any repayments and there never will be. It is not in the spirit of WTO.” Assuming an EU appeal failed and the WTO approved retaliatory tariffs — which could potentially amount to more than $10 billion — the U.S. government could then move to slap tariffs on EU products or services. Political reality is that a trade war would not begin without serious negotiations between the EU and U.S. Such negotiations are unlikely until the case against Boeing reaches the same stage as the one against Airbus and all appeals in both are exhausted.

Boeing jet deal means big boost for St. Louis jobs By Chuck Raasch St. Louis Post-Dispatch Chuck Raasch Sep 28, 2016 (…) Courtesy Boeing F/A-18E/F Super Hornets, in a photo provided by Boeing. WASHINGTON • The administration of President Barack Obama has approved $7 billion in long-stalled sales of Boeing Co. fighter jets to Kuwait and Qatar, a decision that could preserve thousands of jobs in the St. Louis area. The deal had been delayed for more than two years, amid concerns by Israel that the planes posed a threat to that nation’s security. But members of Missouri’s delegation had long touted the sale as a jobs boost for the St. Louis region, where F/A-18E/F Super Hornets and F-15 Eagles are produced. The Navy also is considering building an additional 14 or more Super Hornets to replace aging ones and add to the Pentagon’s strike-force capabilities, although funding for them has been caught in the ongoing debate over spending bills now stalled in Congress. Reuters reported earlier this month that the sale had essentially been approved and that the next step would be notifying members of Congress. U.S. Rep. Ann Wagner, R-Ballwin, was among lawmakers applauding the decision. The fighter jet sales, she said, “will help our allies located within a volatile region fight the growing threats of Islamic extremism.” “These jets are also critical to the St. Louis manufacturing base and support 5,000 families whose loved ones build these jets, as well as thousands of additional jobs across Missouri,” she said. “I am thrilled that this sale was approved, which will keep the Super Hornet production line in St. Louis running into 2020.” U.S. Rep. William Lacy Clay, D-St. Louis, agreed. “The administration’s approval of additional foreign sales of Boeing F-15 Eagles and Boeing F/A-18 Super Hornets will not only strengthen our Gulf allies, it will protect thousands of skilled manufacturing jobs in north St. Louis County and at Boeing suppliers across Missouri and Illinois,” Clay said in a statement. U.S. Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo., said via Twitter, “I’ve been proud to back the F-15 and F-18 programs and the thousands of jobs they support, and will continue to do so.” The sales were delayed amid concerns raised by Israel, Washington’s closest Middle East ally. U.S. officials have also criticized Qatar for alleged ties to armed Islamist groups. Earlier this month, the U.S. pledged to provide $38 billion in military assistance to Israel over the next decade, the largest such aid package in history. The state of Qatar requested to buy at least 36 of the F-15 air-superiority jets, and possibly 72. Boeing is busy building F-15s for Saudi Arabia, and those orders would keep production lines in north St. Louis County running into 2019. The Qatari orders, worth $4 billion, would extend that into the early 2020s. Kuwait had requested 28 F/A-18 Super Hornet attack jets, with an option for 12 more. Boeing has enough orders to keep that line running into 2018. The $3 billion Kuwaiti order, combined with orders requested by the Navy, would extend production into 2020.

Check our People in Business See how St. Louis stocks are faring Boeing employs nearly 15,000 people in the St. Louis area. Boeing has never specified the number employed on the fighter programs, but it reaches several thousand. The White House also approved a sale of 17 Lockheed F-16 fighters to Bahrain, Reuters reported. The sales will be announced formally once the informal 40-day congressional notification period has ended. Then lawmakers will have 30 days to block the sales, although such action is rare. The approval of the fighter jet sales comes as the White House tries to bolster relations with Persian Gulf Arab allies who want to upgrade their military capabilities. They fear the United States is drawing closer to Iran, their archrival, after Tehran’s nuclear deal with world powers last year. Qatar, home to the largest U.S. air base in the Middle East, and Kuwait have ramped up military spending after uprisings across the Arab world and amid rising tension between Sunni Muslim Gulf Arab states and Iran, the region’s Shiite power. Both Qatar and Kuwait are part of a 34-nation alliance announced by Saudi Arabia in December aimed at countering Islamic State and al-Qaida militants in Iraq, Syria, Libya, Egypt and Afghanistan. Sources said both the U.S. State Department and Pentagon had largely agreed to the deals some time ago but had been awaiting final approval from the White House.

By Richard Tomkins   |   Sept. 28, 2016 at 4:08 PM Follow @upi Comments Sign up for our Security newsletter SEATTLE, Sept. 28 (UPI) -- The first of 12 P-8A Poseidon aircraft for the Royal Australian Air Force has been unveiled by Boeing at a rollout ceremony in Seattle, Wash. The maritime patrol and surveillance aircraft, based on the design of Boeing's 737-800 fuselage, will fly to Australia in November. "It is a privilege to accept the first Australian P-8A Poseidon aircraft," Australia's Chief of Air Force, Air Marshal Leo Davies, said at the rollout ceremony. "The P-8A is the latest in a pedigree of Boeing aircraft that have provided important and significant operational capability to Australia." The aircraft, used for anti-submarine warfare, anti-surface warfare and shipping interdiction, features a weapons bay as well as under-wing and under-fuselage hard points for weapons. It has a maximum speed of 564 miles per hour, a combat radius of 1,200 nautical miles and a service ceiling of 41,000 feet. Australia's Director Maritime Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance and Response Transition Office, Group Captain Roger McCutcheon, says the P-8A will be a fundamental element of Australia's future maritime patrol and response strategy in replacing the country's AP-3C Orion aircraft, which are slated for retirement in 2018-2019. Boeing said the remaining 11 Poseidons for Ausstralia will be delivered by 2020.

Boeing churns out P-8 sub hunters based on 737 Originally published September 27, 2016 at 6:09 pm Updated October 4, 2016 at 1:21 pm Boeing rolled out the Royal Australian Air Force’s first P-8 Poseidon anti-submarine aircraft Tuesday. The plane — a rare military-procurement program delivering on time and under budget — is already in service with both the U.S. Navy and the Indian Navy. Share story By Dominic Gates Seattle Times aerospace reporter Boeing on Tuesday rolled out the first P-8 Poseidon anti-submarine aircraft — based on its 737 commercial jet — destined for the Royal Australian Air Force. On a tour of the plant at Boeing Field where mechanics install the plane’s military systems, Steve Tripp, who heads P-8 sales to foreign militaries, touted the efficiency of Boeing’s P-8 manufacturing operation. The program is going so smoothly that Boeing has been able to drop the base price of the aircraft by about 30 percent from about $170 million to $115 million. “It’s good to be a major defense acquisition program that delivers on time and under budget,” Tripp said.

The Australian jet, the first of 12 for that nation, is the 60th flying P-8 built. The U.S. Navy has already taken six flight-test P-8s and 45 production aircraft, and has deployed those on intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance missions in the western Pacific, the Mediterranean and North Atlantic. The Indian Navy took eight P-8s. Boeing also built two ground-test planes at the program’s outset. At the rollout ceremony, Vice Admiral Mike Shoemaker, commander of U.S. Naval Air Forces, said Boeing has been delivering a “tremendous quality” aircraft. Air Marshal Leo Davies, head of Australia’s Air Force, said the 220 Australians currently training on the P-8 in the U.S. are excited to finally get their hands on the P-8’s advanced technology. The P-8 bristles with antennae and fins used to detect radio or acoustic signals. Sonobuoys are deployed from tubular holes in the jet’s underbelly to listen for submarines. The wings are fitted with pylons to carry Harpoon missiles for striking surface ships. A bomb bay carries Mark 54 torpedoes. Inside the plane, operators sit at five computer work stations with touch screens, monitoring the data from sensors and weapons systems and networking with other aircraft and military assets. An unusual blister on the casing of the standard 737 CFM engine covers a powerful generator that runs all the mission systems on board. Built differently The jets are assembled and painted in Renton, then flown to Boeing Field and moved at night across East Marginal Way South to the old Thompson building — where in the 1960s the first few 737 airliners were built. Because the old building isn’t quite wide enough, the P-8’s raked wingtips are removed before it enters, then put back on when it emerges. A tour of the Thompson site Tuesday — no photos allowed due to military restrictions — indicated how Boeing has been able to achieve the cost efficiency that’s impressed the U.S. Navy. The old way Boeing manufactured a military derivative aircraft — say a 707-based Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS) plane — was to build a basic commercial airframe, then deliver it to a special completion center where holes would be cut out of it for weapons and structural parts beefed up as needed for the mission load. For the P-8, Boeing introduced “in-line production,” meaning that all those structural changes to the airframe are incorporated as it is built, not afterward. So for example, the aluminum skin of a P-8 is almost twice as thick as a regular 737 because the airframe has to withstand much more stressful maneuvers. So from the beginning of production, a different gauge of metal is used. “From the day this was a roll of aluminum, it was always going to be a P-8, not a 737,” Tripp said. Likewise the fuselage and wings have many more stiffening stringers and frames, meaning many more rivets. The holes in the fuselage for regular passenger windows are absent. But one big picture window on each side of the fuselage accommodates a spotter looking for surface vessels. The large bomb bay is cut out of the belly. That’s the way the fuselage is built by Spirit AeroSystems in Wichita, Kan. “We don’t build it, unbuild it and rebuild it,” said Tripp. “We build it from day one with this end state in mind.” As a result, the Thompson building is very quiet. Instead of riveting or metal work, the mechanics are installing, plugging in and testing the systems. Between 1,000 and 1,300 defense-side employees work on the P-8 program in Seattle, with hundreds more staffing the P-8 assembly line in Renton. They are producing 12 of the jets per year now, and moving to 18 per year. The U.K. ordered nine P-8s at the Farnborough Air Show near London in July. Boeing expects more foreign sales.

The objectivity of conclusions made by an international group for investigating the MH17 Boeing crash is doubtful, Russian Defense Ministry Spokesperson Major-General Igor Konashenkov said.

The serious conclusions, which have been announced today, require serious arguments and moreover facts," the Russian Defense Ministry spokesman said. "The data, which the investigation group presented at a briefing on Wednesday, had been taken from two main sources: the Internet and Ukraine’s security services. Therefore, the objectivity of that data and consequently the conclusions made on its basis cannot but be doubtful," Konashenkov stressed. "For our part, we want a maximum objective investigation, which will help identifying persons who are really responsible for the July 17, 2014 crash. We will continue rendering all the necessary assistance to the investigation," he added. Russian air defense systems never crossed Ukrainian border According to Konashenkov, no Russian air defense systems have ever crossed the Ukrainian border. "No Russian air defense systems, including Buk, have ever crossed the Russian-Ukrainian border. We made a firm statement to that effect immediately after the July 17, 2014 disaster," he said.

"The data will be transferred soon. We’re not dealing with this. They have been transferred to the competent bodies. We are using the copies of these records in this demonstration," he said. The Malaysia Airlines Boeing-777 passenger airliner on a flight from the Dutch city of Amsterdam to the Malaysian capital of Kuala Lumpur crashed in the area of hostilities between local militias and Ukrainian governmental troops in east Ukraine’s Donetsk region in July last year.

RT takes a look at what we know so far from investigators and experts. Malaysia Airlines Boeing-777 flight MH17 left from Amsterdam for the Malaysian capital of Kuala Lumpur on July 17, 2014. The airliner was shot down over the war-torn Donetsk region in eastern Ukraine. All 298 people on board, from 10 countries, were killed, 80 children among them. The plane was directed by Ukrainian air traffic control to fly over the armed conflict zone, where Ukrainian government forces had been battling rebels, opposing a coup-imposed government in Kiev. By July 2014, Kiev had lost at least 16 military aircraft in the crackdown, including two that went down just days prior to the MH17 tragedy. The airspace, however, had not been closed to civilian flights. There are two official probes into the MH17 disaster - a technical inquiry led by the Dutch Safety Board, and a separate criminal investigation by the Joint Investigation Team (JIT). It consists of investigators and experts from the Netherlands, Belgium, Australia, Malaysia and Ukraine, and is set to determine who was responsible for the incident. Read more Final MH17 crash report ‘unsubstantiated, inaccurate,’ new Russian probe says Dutch Safety Board report The biggest public report to come out on the downing of MH17 so far was released by the Dutch Safety Board (DSB) in October 2015. According to the DSB’s findings, the Boeing 777 was shot down by a Buk missile with a 9N314M warhead. The Dutch experts were unable to determine which side in the conflict – the Ukrainian government forces or the rebels – was responsible for firing the missile. At the same time the 279-page report, which focused on the technical details connected with the incident and their implications for flying over conflict zones, stressed that the aviation authorities “did not adequately recognize the risks of the armed conflict in the eastern part of Ukraine to overflying civil aviation,” adding that there was “sufficient reason for closing the airspace above the eastern part of Ukraine as a precaution.” The DSB report provided no explanation for Ukraine’s failure to close the airspace over the conflict zone. Read more MH17 downed by outdated BUK missile fired from Kiev-controlled area – Defense system manufacturer Buk producer experiment Two unprecedented large-scale experiments, conducted by the Russian Almaz-Antey defense company in order to recreate the MH17 tragedy, concluded that the missile that downed the flight was an old model last produced in the Soviet Union in 1986 and fired from a Ukraine-controlled area, contesting the theory by Dutch investigators. The Dutch investigators said the missile came from somewhere within a 320 square kilometer area within eastern Ukraine, which would mean it could not establish the side of the conflict which had controlled that launch site. Meanwhile, the experiment conducted by Almaz-Antey (the producer of the Buk missile system) reportedly demonstrated that the aircraft could only have been hit by a Buk missile if it had come from the village of Zaroshchenskoye in Ukrainian military-controlled territory. Read more MH17 could have been downed unintentionally – int’l investigation team Joint Investigation Team comments from June Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 could have been downed “unintentionally,” a preliminary report by the Joint Investigation Team (JIT) said in June, adding that experts working on the case often lack the experience and data needed. “An important question for the criminal investigation is whether a missile can be launched unintentionally. Did anyone accidentally push a button which caused the missile to be launched? Or can this only be done by means of a conscious act?” reads a JIT report, published on the Dutch Public Prosecution Service’s website. The Dutch report gives no answers, complaining that it is often hard to find the relevant information while the investigators involved in the enquiry are simply “untrained” for dealing with such issues. Read more Russian radar data shows no missile attack on MH17 from rebel side, indicates Ukraine involvement New radar data Newly discovered raw data picked up by a civilian radar station on the day of the Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 crash shows no signs of a missile being fired at the plane from territory controlled by rebels, the Russian military and radar producer Lianozovsky Electromechanical Plant reported earlier this week. The plant is the producer of the Utyos-T civilian radar station and one such station is deployed near the village of Ust-Donetsky in western Russia. The data showed three civilian aircraft in the vicinity, including the MH17. The one closest to it was flying about 30km from the Malaysian Boeing at the time it was shot down. “The Ust-Donetsky radar picked up no foreign objects near the Malaysian plane which could have caused its destruction,” said Viktor Meshcheryakov, the company’s deputy chief radar designer. This contradicts the scenario maintained by Kiev, in which a Buk missile could have been fired from the rebel-controlled village of Snezhnoye. The missile could have not been picked up by the radar if it had approached from a direction along the line connecting the radar station and the airliner, Meshcheryakov noted. Gen. Andrey Koban, head of the Russian Air Force radar troops, said that “the fact that Ukraine has not published radar data leads us to the conjecture that the missile, if it was a Buk, was launched from territory under the control of the Ukrainian military.” Read more MH17 downing anniversary: Two years of accusations & few facts Blame game Ukraine and its foreign sponsors accuse Russia of arming and supporting the rebels, an accusation that Moscow denies. Amid the hostilities, Kiev regularly accused Russia of invading Ukraine, claiming that it could not seize control of its eastern territory because of the Kremlin’s fighter jets, tanks, and multiple rocket launchers. Almost immediately after the MH17 was downed, Western media and some governments blamed Russia, claiming Moscow had either provided the Buk system to the rebels or sent its regular troops to take down Ukrainian warplanes on their behalf. In response to the accusations, Moscow has demanded that a thorough investigation be carried out and suggested plausible scenarios that contradict the Western narrative. It has also challenged Kiev’s claims that Ukraine had neither warplanes nor Buk systems in the area by producing public satellite and radar images showing evidence to the contrary. While the US claims to have evidence proving the rebels’ complicity, that data, if it does indeed exist, has never been declassified or shared with the public or investigators. Read more ‘Reading tea leaves’: German expert questions Bellingcat’s MH17 photo scoop Activists’ analysis The mystery behind the MH17 crash has prompted many to launch their own investigations. Among them was British online investigative activist group Bellingcat, which tried to prove that the Malaysian Boeing was shot down by a Buk missile system belonging to the Russian Army. It also accused Russia of altering satellite images from the MH17 disaster. German image forensics expert Jens Kriese criticized their methods and conclusions. “What Bellingcat is doing is nothing more than reading tea leaves. Error Level Analysis is a method used by hobbyists,” Kriese, a professional image analyst and former scientific researcher, said. This month, a group of Russian activists also released what they say is a fresh batch of discrepancies spotted in Bellingcat’s MH17 investigation.

  News Magazines Media Industry Directory Events Products   Home >> News: September 28th, 2016 >> Story Satnews Daily September 28th, 2016 Future Leaders & Mentor Of The Year Named By SSPI The Society of Satellite Professionals International (SSPI) will present their 2016 Promise Awards to: Dr. Jennifer Dawson of Space Systems Loral (SSL) Pascale Dumit of SES Erin Feller of Boeing Network & Space Systems   The Promise Awards honor three satellite executives age 35 and under for outstanding achievement in the early stages of their career. The three recipients will be honored on November 9th in New York City at SSPI’s 11th Annual Future Leaders Dinner. On that night, SSPI will also honor its 2016 Mentor of the Year, David Myers of DataPath, for the encouragement, support, and inspiration he has provided to young professionals throughout his career. “We received a large number of nominations from the US and Europe this year,” said SSPI executive director Robert Bell, “and the choice was particularly difficult.  The three winners represent the most outstanding of an extraordinary group. whom we will be honoring through the rest of the year and into 2017.  And there’s something just as extraordinary about them in this male-dominated industry: on average, three-quarters of winners over the past four years have been women, compared with only one-quarter in the prior four years.” The 2016 Future Leaders Dinner (www.satfuture.com) takes place at The Penn Club in Manhattan on Wednesday, November 9th, on the first night of the 2016 NAB New York Show. The proceeds of the dinner go to fund SSPI’s educational, professional development and industry growth initiatives. During the 2016 NAB New York Show, the three Promise Award winners will participate in the November 10 keynote panel, “Pathways to the Future - A Dialogue Between Today's Industry Leaders and the Promise of the Future,” featuring Mark Spiwak, the President of Boeing Satellite Systems International. The panel will be presented at 11:30 a.m. The SSPI 2016 Promise Award Winners: Dr. Jennifer Dawson Director, Marketing & Sales, Space Systems Loral (SSL) Dr. Jennifer Dawson of Space Systems Loral (SSL). Before joining the company, Jennifer was a researcher at Stanford University, where she developed a cryogenic test facility, conducted experiments on a superconducting position sensor, defined requirements, and fabricated and tested customized electrical connectors. While at Stanford, Jennifer received a NASA Group Achievement Award in 2005 for her work on the Gravity Probe B relativity gyroscope experiment developed by NASA and the university. After finishing her PhD, she went on to teach for two years at York College in Pennsylvania. Jennifer joined SSL in 2010 as a Senior Spacecraft Systems Engineer. In that position, she performed critical analysis of satellite design and led teams in design, test, and anomaly resolution. In particular, she led the mechanical design and environmental accommodation team for a NASA-hosted payload. In 2012, Jennifer became the Chair of SSL’s Shock Committee. The Committee defines company-wide shock qualification requirements and oversees design and test for shock caused by the extreme environment that a satellite has to withstand at launch. As Chair, she redefined the company’s qualification requirements, simplifying them and eliminating over-specification. Jennifer became Product Assurance Program Manager in 2015 and was one of the youngest employees at SSL to ever take on this position. In this role, she led the mission assurance team for one of SSL’s satellites to ensure spacecraft quality and reliability.  She oversaw all analysis, design, integration, and testing, and helped the customer directly with their own oversight. In September 2016 Jennifer assumed her current role as Director of Marketing and Sales, where she channels her technical and customer-focused experience into helping satellite operators develop systems that strengthen their businesses. Her experience as a teacher and researcher has helped Jennifer drive SSL to establish new technical standards and to educate her colleagues in putting these new practices into place. She is known for looking beyond established practices for solutions to problems and is always offering fresh approaches and ideas when confronted with a challenge. According to Senior Vice President of Program Management David Bernstein, Jennifer is “dedicated to doing things the right way” and “explains things very well and is always open to teaching what she knows.” She excels at managing and training others both inside and outside the company and is currently mentoring students through both Bucknell University and Stanford University. Pascale Dumit Manager, Spectrum Management and Development, Americas, SES Pascale Dumit of SES. Pascale began her career in the satellite industry in 2005 at Hughes, where she designed and commissioned broadband satellite networks in Africa and the Americas. Pascale went on to work as a consultant at ITT Exelis (now the Harris Corporation) where she supported NASA as well as the Department of Defense on a broad range of international spectrum management issues and contributed to the overall development and implementation of strategy in national and international spectrum regulatory environments. As a Manager of Spectrum Management and Development at SES, Pascale manages spectrum matters both at the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) and is responsible for the development and protection of spectrum assets for select SES projects over the Americas. She is currently leading all domestic and international spectrum-related activities, including coordination and licensing for SES-15, a new high throughput satellite to be launched in 2017 and expected to serve SES’s leading aeronautical customers and other traffic intensive data applications such as government, VSAT networks and maritime. Throughout her career, Pascale has demonstrated a natural leadership as well as an inherent ability to bring together various parties and drive collaboration among them to achieve successful results. According to Kimberly Baum, Vice President of Spectrum Management and Development for the Americas and Pascale’s manager, she regularly has “government representatives request that Pascale attend their meetings; they know she is the most reliable, effective advocate they could have to achieve the US’s objectives at any given meeting.” In a particularly exemplary display of coordination and leadership, Pascale was instrumental in coordinating efforts among the satellite industry representatives at the international meetings leading up to the ITU World Radiocommunication Conference (WRC-15) and led major advocacy efforts that resulted in the protection of existing spectrum for SES’s customers and regulatory certainty for the industry. In addition to her many achievements at SES, Pascale is an active member of her community. For the last 10+ years, she has consistently dedicated herself to helping other engineers succeed. Pascale was recently recognized by her alma mater, The George Washington University, for her service to the university community and received the university’s 2016 Alumni Outstanding Service Award. She served as Chair of the Engineering Alumni Association (GW EAA) from 2013 to 2015, and held several other positions within the GW EAA in previous years. Pascale remains involved in the GW EAA to this day. Erin Feller Advanced Government Space Systems Project Manager, Boeing Network & Space Systems Erin Feller of Boeing Network & Space Systems. During her time at Boeing, Erin has led space and ground architecture studies aimed at revolutionizing the future of the industry. She has consistently demonstrated her strong communication and leadership skills both within the company and with government customers. According to her direct manager, Matt Richards, Erin “is regularly sought after within the Boeing satellite business as one of the top proposal leads” and he has been “approached by Boeing executives across government and commercial satellite systems organizations requesting Ms. Feller by name to support their highest priority new business campaigns.” Early in her career at Boeing, Erin was instrumental in establishing the Concurrent Integrated Engineering Laboratory (CIEL), used for rapid satellite design development at the Boeing Satellite Design Center. Using the experience and insight she gained from working on the CIEL, she went on to perform many design-to-cost exercises for the development of commercial-like concepts for military satellite communications spacecraft. Erin has led several critical programs at Boeing, recently including one of the company’s largest business orders for 2016. Erin is also spearheading an effort to develop new commercial-like offerings for international partners on military satellite communications (MILSATCOM). As part of this effort, she led the team in developing three different technical spacecraft offerings as well as business strategy. In addition to her technical, leadership, project management, and business skills, Erin brings energy, creativity, and focus to the greater satellite enterprise, and she is known for inspiring the same in others who work with her. She has consistently developed innovative teams as a leader at Boeing, teams that her customers acknowledge as focused and efficient. Erin has been selected for Boeing’s Emerging Leader Development Program and hopes to take on more leadership roles and responsibility in the future. Beyond her many achievements, Erin has consistently worked to help other engineering students beginning during her days as one of them. While working on her Mechanical Engineering degree at the University of Nebraska, she spent two years as a resident assistant and leading recruiting and social activities in the engineering department as an Engineering Ambassador. While at Boeing, Erin has dedicated much of her personal time to helping newly hired Boeing engineers. She is a founding member of “Boeing Spacecraft and Flight Systems Engineering Early Career Think Tank” as well as part of the original team that developed and implemented a campus-wide new hire and early career summer training program. The SSPI 2016 Mentor of the Year David Myers President & CEO, DataPath David Myers, the President and CEO of DataPath. As President & CEO of DataPath, David Myers is leading a renewed privately-owned company that emerged after a spin-out from publically traded Rockwell Collins.  Over the past two-plus years, the revitalized DataPath has developed an array of new offerings including satellite antenna systems, remote management software, connectivity services, and cyber security solutions.  These investments are fueling an overall strategy to provide end-to-end communications solutions for the aerospace, broadcast, defense, and infrastructure markets.  To date, the reinvestment in DataPath has resulted in over $400M in new contract awards. Prior to joining DataPath, David held a number of senior level positions across the satellite industry, developing brands, launching new products and entering new markets.  David spent several years at Harris CapRock (formerly CapRock Communications), as Vice President of Marketing & Product Management, President of Government Solutions, and ultimately Chief Commercial Officer.  One of his proudest accomplishments was the development of “CommandAccess®,” the industry’s first military-grade satellite subscription service. David also previously served as Chief Marketing Officer for ITC Global, where he expanded the company’s market presence from a relative unknown to among the top three brands in the oil & gas and mining markets.  David first entered the satellite industry at Spacenet, where he worked his way up from business development and product management roles to eventually serve as the company’s Senior Vice President of Marketing & Corporate Development. In addition to product and market innovation, David believes the core foundation for any successful company is a highly collaborative culture.  The key is encouraging initiative and creativity from every employee, regardless of title or tenure.  To foster this culture, David regularly walks the factory floor and holds skip level lunch meetings, so he can hear first-hand what “real people” think about their jobs and how the company is doing.  These live interactions often result in a new idea for a product or process.  David’s favorite approach is to empower the person who championed the idea to build a task force and “make it happen.” In a manager’s meeting shortly after taking over as CEO David remarked, “Rapidly growing organizations must be dynamic. You don’t necessarily need to have all the right players in all the right positions, right away.   Making a team successful is about recruiting great all-around athletes and then helping them find something to own, where they can apply their talents and passion to drive the company’s performance.” When notified about his selection for the SSPI Mentor of the Year award, David said, “I consider myself a life-long student of the industry and fortunate to have worked with and learned from some amazing people.  I am a true believer in the SSPI mission to encourage new talent to build impactful careers in the exciting and dynamic industry that is satellite communications.” www.sspi.org   Topical Tags :  Events    Business Moves    Executive Moves    Service Provider          Regional Tags :  North America    Global                 FREE SUBSCRIPTIONS Today's Top News Thrusting Galileo Update: Thursday Evening's Status...ULA's Atlas V Gets Ready To GOES-R Better Satellite World Award Honorees Brought To Light By SSPI Core Concerns Regarding Cybersecurity For The Satellite Industry Voiced By SIA & GVF Pairing Up For Multi-Screen Goodness Are Broadpeak & Eutelsat Communications More News AST Involved In Weather Warning Implementation System In Malaysia Rock Seven Is Buoyed Up For Seafaring SATCOM Solutions The Rebirth Of A UK Satellite Broadcasting Group Care To Chip In To Project Blue?

Speaking at a press conference, held on September 27, Oman Air’s chief executive officer Paul Gregorowitsch delivered a key report on the airline’s progress and plans for continued expansion. Additional details were supplied by chief commercial officer Abdulrahaman Al Busaidy, and executive vice president, Products and Brand Development, Abdulaziz Alraisi. Gregorowitsch said: “I am pleased to report that Oman Air has achieved important progress over the last two years and I am optimistic about the company’s future. With the invaluable support of Oman Air’s board of directors, we have a clear vision, achievable objectives and a set of values to which all our employees are committed. We are also delivering an ambitious and dynamic programme of fleet and network expansion. This has seen the company take delivery of outstanding new aircraft, introduce a range of exciting new destinations and launch new products and services which contribute to a seamless passenger experience. “Despite substantial economic challenges, Oman Air is in a strong position to continue its progress towards becoming a successful, sustainable company of the highest quality: in other words, To Become the Best.” Oman Air’s fleet expansion programme has already made significant progress. With the first of the new aircraft being delivered in the last quarter of 2014, Oman Air fleet size stood at 35 aircraft by January 2015. One year later, in January 2016, the fleet had increased in size to 41 aircraft. Currently Oman Air’s fleet consists of four Boeing 787 Dreamliners, six Airbus 330-300s, four Airbus 330-200s, five Boeing 737-900s, 21 Boeing 737-800, one Boeing 737-700 and four Embraer 175s. Oman Air has operated B737s for many years and the aircraft provide the backbone of the airline’s long and medium haul fleet. Furthermore, Oman Air was the first carrier in the Middle East region to operate the B737-900ER aircraft type. Meanwhile, the introduction of the first of many B787 Dreamliners – initially on the Muscat to Frankfurt service - represents a step-change in the Oman Air long haul passenger experience. The aircraft offers guests more natural light, increased cabin pressure, cleaner cabin air and reduced noise. Benefits for the airline include outstanding fuel economy, reduced emissions and a lower noise footprint. Oman Air’s fleet size stands at 45 aircraft, with at least two more B737s expected to be delivered before the end of the year, and four more B787s due for delivery over the next two years. Gregorowitsch also described how Oman Air’s network has grown in parallel with its fleet expansion. "Recent international destinations to be added to the airline’s network include Manila, Jakarta, Singapore, Goa, Dhaka and Mashhad, while Guangzhou in China will be launched on December 9, 2016. Frequencies have also been increased on many established routes, including Frankfurt, Paris, Zurich and London, whilst all Indian destinations now enjoy at least daily or double-daily services. In addition, we will be launching, Manchester, our second destination in the UK in our Summer 2017 schedule.” Customer choice has been further broadened through the strategic use of codeshare agreements with airline’s that share Oman Air’s commitment to quality. The company currently operates codeshare partnerships with Emirates Airlines, Ethiopian Airlines, Royal Jordanian, Turkish Airlines, Sri Lankan Airlines, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, Garuda Airlines, Saudia and Thai Airways. Gregorowitsch continued: “Oman Air has enjoyed a long history of working closely with commercial partners to deliver added value for our customers. The positive and productive codeshare partnerships that we have entered offer an expanded range of choices and increased convenience, and are also an excellent way of introducing more air travellers to Oman Air’s onboard products, hospitality and network. “We have no current plans to seek membership of one of the global airline alliances, but we will be developing some exciting tactical partnerships. As a result, we will be working closely with One World; with Star Alliance members Lufthansa, United Airlines, Turkish Airlines and with SkyTeam members Kenya Airways and KLM. “Furthermore, we remain committed to the partnerships we have successfully developed elsewhere within our business. These include our work with Cargolux, moving freight between Europe, East Africa, the Middle East and India; with freight handling specialists SATS; and with Menzies Aviation, for ground handling in Oman. In addition, Oman Air has signed agreements with service providers such as Sixt, Bank Muscat, Shangri La hotels and resorts, Rocketmiles, Al Nahdha Resort and Spa, and Muscat Duty Free, among various others that increase the mileage earnings of our FFP members. The accelerated fleet and network growth has required significant investment in new aircraft and landing slots, reported Gregorowitsch. However, further major investment has also been made in many other areas of Oman Air’s operations. Additional investments in a forthcoming new crew village at Muscat, crew reporting, flight simulators, headquarters infrastructure and management information systems are facilitating more efficient and effective delivery of Oman Air’s services, he added. Such investments have been made against a challenging economic background, warned Oman Air’s CEO. Year-on-year reductions in the levels of support offered to Oman Air by the government in 2014, 2015 and 2016 are set to continue and over-capacity within the air travel market is driving prices down, leading to a cut into potential yields. Fleet and network expansion has seen a parallel expansion in the number of staff employed internationally, resulting increases in payroll and on-costs. However, an important positive outcome is that the proportion of Omani citizens employed by Oman Air has continued to grow and now stands at 64 per cent, underlining the airline’s ongoing commitment to Omanisation. In conclusion, Gregorowitsch expressed his concern regarding the existing infrastructure at Muscat Airport which is affecting the growth initiatives of the National airline. He clearly identified the need to have a second runway available as soon as the new passenger terminal is inaugurated to cater for the planned growth and ongoing contribution to the national economy. The CEO’s remarks were followed by those of Al Busaidy. He provided details of Oman Air’s forthcoming Winter 2016/17 flight schedule, including anticipated new destinations, and offered an outline of what customers may expect of the Summer 2017 schedule. Al Busaidy commented: “Having launched many attractive and extremely popular destinations over recent months, we look forward to further expanding Oman Air’s network in the course of the Winter 2016/17 and Summer 2017 schedules. Perhaps the most notable of these will be Guangzhou, our first destination in China, the operations of which will start from December 9.   “The service will initially offer four flights per week on Monday, Wednesday, Friday and Sunday from Muscat to Guangzhou and on Sunday, Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday from Guangzhou to Muscat. Oman Air will serve customers on the new route using award winning Airbus 330-200s, configured with 196 Economy Class seats and 30 Business Class seats. As a result of our new service, we anticipate welcoming many more visitors from China to Oman. In addition, Guangzhou offers access for air leisure travellers from Oman, and from throughout our international network, to a myriad of business and leisure opportunities within South China. “Furthermore, the new Muscat to Guangzhou route will strengthen the important political, economic and trade relations between Oman and China. We are confident that the service will be a great success and we look forward to a long and prosperous presence within the Chinese market. “A major highlight of our Summer 2017 schedule will be our daily flights to Manchester, complementing the double-daily service we currently offer to London. The new service will offer easy access for international visitors to the north of the UK, and many more British travellers will enjoy the convenience of connecting with Oman Air’s global network.” The strategic developments set out by Mr Gregorowitsch and Mr Al Busaidy were followed by a presentation on the subject of ‘Meeting customer expectations’, which was given by Abdulaziz Alraisi. Alraisi went on to detail major changes in cabin service and branding at Oman Air. These include the introduction of improved inflight entertainment systems, which offer an increased choice of recently-released Hollywood movies and a broader range of TV programmes. A new safety video which showcases the destination of Oman, together with its rich historical and cultural heritage will also be introduced. In addition, cabin crew will undergo enhanced training to ensure that all customers are offered the very best inflight service. Alraisi continued: “We are delighted to announce that Oman Air will unveil a brand-new First Class cabin aboard our Boeing B787-900 Dreamliner aircraft, which will be delivered in 2018.

Etihad Airways B787 Dreamliner to fly Abu Dhabi - Riyadh route 28 September, 2016 28 September 2016 RIYADH – Etihad Airways is to deploy a Boeing 787 Dreamliner on one of its twice-daily scheduled flights between Abu Dhabi and Riyadh, with effect from Oct. 30,. The upgrade from a single aisle Airbus A321 aircraft will cater to strong demand to and from the capital of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, offering guests more seats on a wide-body aircraft. Together with the other daily Riyadh service operated by a Boeing 777, Etihad Airways will have more than 8,700 weekly seats on the route. Flight EY317 will be operated with a B787, departing Abu Dhabi at 10:15 hrs, arriving into Riyadh at 11:15 hrs. The return flight EY318 departs Riyadh at 16:25 hrs, arriving into Abu Dhabi at 19:10 hrs. The flights will provide optimal timings for guests in Abu Dhabi and Riyadh, and convenient connections to and from destinations across key markets in Europe, Indian subcontinent, Asia and Australia. The 299-seat aircraft, configured in two classes, offers award-winning cabin interiors with 28 seats in Business and 271 in Economy. Advertisement Guests will be able to experience the airline’s renowned Business Studio on board. The seat, which provides guests with direct aisle access, is also equipped with an in-seat massage and air cushion control system. Business Class guests using the service can choose from three main courses, with further dine-on-demand options available. There are also specialized services onboard, including a Food & Beverage Manager in the premium cabin, multi-national cabin crew and Flying Nannies, who are able to provide support to parents travelling with young children. For B787 Economy Class passengers, the airline’s commitment to providing the best guest experiences is showcased by its ‘Smart Seats’. They have been designed to provide additional comfort through simple design features such as a ‘fixed wing’ headrest, extra seat width and individual TV monitors. Etihad Airways currently operates the latest Panasonic eX3 IFE equipment for its B787 inflight entertainment system. Mobile connectivity with access to onboard Wi-Fi and seven satellite channels of live TV are also available. Kevin Knight, Etihad Airways Chief Strategy and Planning Officer, said: “The Boeing 787 is playing a key role in Etihad Airways’ fleet expansion with routes carefully selected on which to deploy this unique aircraft. We are delighted that Riyadh will soon join our 787 cities giving guests a different experience to and from Abu Dhabi, and with convenient connections to destinations across our diverse worldwide network. “The aircraft also provides significantly more cargo capacity to facilitate the movement of a greater number of goods to and from the Saudi capital. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is a very important market for Etihad Airways, supporting our global expansion since the launch of services 13 years ago. Our commitment to the Saudi market has grown since we began flying to Riyadh in 2004, steadily increasing our presence to the current 63 flights each week to and from four Saudi cities.” On the Riyadh route alone, Etihad Airways has flown more than 2.5 million guests since 2004. Etihad Airways’ flights to Riyadh, Jeddah, Madinah and Dammam are complemented by Saudi codeshare partner flynas, whose dedicated services between Abu Dhabi and both Riyadh and Jeddah provide travellers with even more choice. Riyadh becomes Etihad Airways’ newest B787 destination this year following the induction of the aircraft on flights to Perth, Dusseldorf and Shanghai, with Abu Dhabi – Johannesburg set to become a Dreamliner route on 1 November. Etihad Airways’ current fleet of nine B787s also operates to Singapore, Washington DC, Brisbane and Zurich. © The Saudi Gazette 2016 © Copyright Zawya. All Rights Reserved.

Conner, called, on Tuesday in Tangiers, on Boeing suppliers to take advantage of Morocco’s incentive program. “We have signed an agreement for the setting up of a Boeing industrial ecosystem in Morocco that will allow us to develop an incentive program to bring new Boeing suppliers to settle in the country,” said Conner in a statement to the press after the audience granted to him by HM King Mohammed VI at the Royal Palace in Tangiers. “We will work closely with the government, notably the ministry of Industry to encourage our suppliers to settle in Morocco and develop their aerospace industry, already present in the kingdom, and to benefit from the incentive program introduced by Morocco,” he added. This ecosystem will generate an additional annual turnover from export of one billion dollars and create 8,700 specialized jobs, said the president of Boeing “Commercial Airplanes”. The audience was attended by minister of Industry, Trade, Investment and Digital Economy, Moulay Hafid Elalamy. HM the King had earlier chaired the signing ceremony of a draft agreement for the establishment of a Boeing industrial ecosystem in Morocco. Join the Conversation. What do you think?

Boeing churns out P-8 sub hunters based on 737 Originally published September 27, 2016 at 6:09 pm Updated October 4, 2016 at 1:21 pm Boeing rolled out the Royal Australian Air Force’s first P-8 Poseidon anti-submarine aircraft Tuesday. The plane — a rare military-procurement program delivering on time and under budget — is already in service with both the U.S. Navy and the Indian Navy. Share story By Dominic Gates Seattle Times aerospace reporter Boeing on Tuesday rolled out the first P-8 Poseidon anti-submarine aircraft — based on its 737 commercial jet — destined for the Royal Australian Air Force. On a tour of the plant at Boeing Field where mechanics install the plane’s military systems, Steve Tripp, who heads P-8 sales to foreign militaries, touted the efficiency of Boeing’s P-8 manufacturing operation. The program is going so smoothly that Boeing has been able to drop the base price of the aircraft by about 30 percent from about $170 million to $115 million. “It’s good to be a major defense acquisition program that delivers on time and under budget,” Tripp said.

The Australian jet, the first of 12 for that nation, is the 60th flying P-8 built. The U.S. Navy has already taken six flight-test P-8s and 45 production aircraft, and has deployed those on intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance missions in the western Pacific, the Mediterranean and North Atlantic. The Indian Navy took eight P-8s. Boeing also built two ground-test planes at the program’s outset. At the rollout ceremony, Vice Admiral Mike Shoemaker, commander of U.S. Naval Air Forces, said Boeing has been delivering a “tremendous quality” aircraft. Air Marshal Leo Davies, head of Australia’s Air Force, said the 220 Australians currently training on the P-8 in the U.S. are excited to finally get their hands on the P-8’s advanced technology. The P-8 bristles with antennae and fins used to detect radio or acoustic signals. Sonobuoys are deployed from tubular holes in the jet’s underbelly to listen for submarines. The wings are fitted with pylons to carry Harpoon missiles for striking surface ships. A bomb bay carries Mark 54 torpedoes. Inside the plane, operators sit at five computer work stations with touch screens, monitoring the data from sensors and weapons systems and networking with other aircraft and military assets. An unusual blister on the casing of the standard 737 CFM engine covers a powerful generator that runs all the mission systems on board. Built differently The jets are assembled and painted in Renton, then flown to Boeing Field and moved at night across East Marginal Way South to the old Thompson building — where in the 1960s the first few 737 airliners were built. Because the old building isn’t quite wide enough, the P-8’s raked wingtips are removed before it enters, then put back on when it emerges. A tour of the Thompson site Tuesday — no photos allowed due to military restrictions — indicated how Boeing has been able to achieve the cost efficiency that’s impressed the U.S. Navy. The old way Boeing manufactured a military derivative aircraft — say a 707-based Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS) plane — was to build a basic commercial airframe, then deliver it to a special completion center where holes would be cut out of it for weapons and structural parts beefed up as needed for the mission load. For the P-8, Boeing introduced “in-line production,” meaning that all those structural changes to the airframe are incorporated as it is built, not afterward. So for example, the aluminum skin of a P-8 is almost twice as thick as a regular 737 because the airframe has to withstand much more stressful maneuvers. So from the beginning of production, a different gauge of metal is used. “From the day this was a roll of aluminum, it was always going to be a P-8, not a 737,” Tripp said. Likewise the fuselage and wings have many more stiffening stringers and frames, meaning many more rivets. The holes in the fuselage for regular passenger windows are absent. But one big picture window on each side of the fuselage accommodates a spotter looking for surface vessels. The large bomb bay is cut out of the belly. That’s the way the fuselage is built by Spirit AeroSystems in Wichita, Kan. “We don’t build it, unbuild it and rebuild it,” said Tripp. “We build it from day one with this end state in mind.” As a result, the Thompson building is very quiet. Instead of riveting or metal work, the mechanics are installing, plugging in and testing the systems. Between 1,000 and 1,300 defense-side employees work on the P-8 program in Seattle, with hundreds more staffing the P-8 assembly line in Renton. They are producing 12 of the jets per year now, and moving to 18 per year. The U.K. ordered nine P-8s at the Farnborough Air Show near London in July. Boeing expects more foreign sales.

National World Business Tech Sport Entertainment Life & Style Travel Motoring Profile Settings Sign Out travel Search Destinations Themes News Travel Troubles Cruising Snow Kiwi Traveller An airline pilot reveals why the Boeing 757 is truly a unique aircraft BENJAMIN ZHANG Last updated 13:29, September 28 2016 Supplied The Boeing 757s are known for their versatility, speed and reliability. Twelve years after Boeing discontinued the 757, the long-time 'tweener" in the company's lineup is still popular among airlines. The Royal New Zealand Air Force has two of the aircraft, used as VIP transport and government services since 2003. Even though the US planemaker booked more than 1000 orders for the jets over its two decades in production, it was never a hot seller. NEWSFLARE Shocking footage of a man and his quad bike flying backwards and rolling into the sea after he parked it behind a Boeing 757 about to take off. By the early 2000's, sales of the 757 had all but dried up, and Boeing put the plane out to pasture in 2004. Read more: * Airbus family flight: A380, A350, A330 and A320 perform spectacular formation flight * Humble Boeing 737 and Airbus A320 set for long-haul * Boeing's iconic 747 could come to an end * Turbo props: slower, noisier, more cramped   SAM SHEPHERD / NZDF The RNZAF Boeing 757 at Pegasus Airfield in Antarctica. Although many of the planes are pushing 25 years of service, airlines are hanging onto their 757s. For instance, Delta, who has spent big bucks on a fleet of new jets, recently refurbished the cabins of its ageing 757s instead of replacing them with newer planes. So why are its customers so loyal? Is the 757 that good? To get some answers, we recently spoke with author and Boeing 757 pilot Patrick Smith about the plane. "There's no denying the 757 is an old plane that was designed in the late 1970s, but the versatility of the plane is remarkable and unmatched," Smith, the author of the book Cockpit Confidential, said. DEREK FLYNN/FAIRFAX NZ The same RNZAF Boeing 757 was used to ferry the Duke and Dutchess of Cambridge on their tour of NZ. "It's profitable on both short-haul domestic as well as trans-Atlantic routes." Ad Feedback During it's production life, the 757 was always a bit of an oddity — a 'tweener of sorts. It's larger and offers greater range than the average narrow body jet, but smaller and cheaper to operate than a wide-body. Boeing and its customers, for many years, didn't quite know how to take full advantage of the plane's capabilities. However, when they did figure it out, it became an integral part of the operators' fleets. Boeing is currently marketing a new stretched variant of its long-serving 737 — called the MAX 9 — as a potential replacement for the 757. Now, there's talk that Boeing may make the 737 even larger to get closer to the 757's capacity. HAMAD I MOHAMMED A DHL International Boeing 757-225 freighter. "Boeing is trying to push the 737 as a viable 757 replacement," Smith said, "In some respects it can and in some respects it can't." For instance, the 737 simply isn't capable of the same kind of engine performance as the 757. According to Smith, the 737 falls way short of the 757 in terms of runway performance. The 737 requires a much higher takeoff speed and much more runway to get off the ground. Sign up for the Two Minutes of Stuff newsletter "The 757 can be off the ground in 4,000 ft. and under 140 knots," he told us. However, Smith recounts being in the cockpit jump seat of a 737 as two other pilots were flying. During takeoff, the author noticed that the plane didn't lift off until 160 knots and used up much more runway. Furthermore, the 757 can comfortably climb straight to its cruising altitude. On the other hand, the 737 requires a step climb procedure that calls for the plane to climb to a certain altitude and burn off some fuel to lighten the load before climbing to a higher altitude. Runway performance matters. Especially when it comes to the type of flying the 757 and the 737 are asked to perform — trans-continental or oceanic flights with a full payload from smaller secondary airports. "The 737 falls short when you're trying fly it longer haul, coast to coast. It can do it, but not by much," Smith said. In addition, when it comes to flying across the Atlantic, "there's concern in the winter, when there are ferocious head winds, the 737 may need to stop for fuel." The reality is that Smith believes the Boeing 737 is a good plane, but is being asked to take on a mission the design wasn't meant to perform. "The Boeing 737 was essentially conceived as a small regional jet nearly five decades ago," Smith told us. "It's an extremely popular plane, but it's being asked to perform missions it wasn't designed for." As a result, Boeing is simply not in a position to bolt bigger engines onto the 737. Since its introduction in the 1960s, Boeing has been installing larger and larger engines on the 737 as the size of the plane grew. Unfortunately, the amount of room underneath the wing hasn't changed. Thus, Boeing has all but maxed out on the size of the engines it can mount on the 737 without completely redesigning the plane's under carriage. Instead of a stretched 737, Smith believes Boeing should have gone for an updated version of the 757 at some point during its production run. "Somewhere along the way, had Being just re-engined the 757 with a new cockpit and new internal systems, it could have been a big hit," Smith told us. In a statement to Business Insider, a Boeing spokesperson wrote: "The 737 MAX will extend the Next-Generation 737 range advantage with the capability to fly more than 3,500 nautical miles. That's an increase of 340-570 nmi over the 737NG which gives our customers the flexibility to open up new markets." With that said, the 757 isn't a perfect plane. "It's a 6-across (seating) narrow body that's long and thin," Smith said. "And for passengers, it can take a long time to board and disembark." In addition, the 757's cockpit is pretty old-fashioned when compared to modern airliners such as the 737 MAX. The controls of the 757 are also much heavier for pilots than its sibling — the Boeing 767. The 757 and 767 were developed at the same time and feature virtually identical cockpits. Finally, the Boeing 757 generates a massive amount of wake turbulence as it flies — forcing air traffic controllers to keep other planes far away from passing 757s.  "No one really knows why, but the 757 has really strong wake turbulence," Smith told us. "The early 757s had worse wake turbulence than the 747." Although Smith added that the addition of winglets on later 757s have greatly decreased the wake turbulence. The Boeing 757 is an aircraft that's come and gone. It served its tour of duty with honour and distinction. Now, it's time for Boeing to find a replacement worthy of stepping into its shoes.

(Photo: REUTERS/Pascal Rossignol) prev next prev next Thumbnail Enlarge Caption  Email More A A REUTERS: Boeing Co is close to clinching a large sale of widebody jetliners to Qatar Airways, a deal that moved closer with the recent U.S. approval of Boeing fighter jet sales to the Gulf nation, according to two people familiar with the situation. Qatar Airways is in the process of firming up the order, which it was due to have placed at July's Farnborough airshow, but which was delayed by the Qatari government in an effort to speed up U.S. approval for the fighter contract, one of the sources said. Bloomberg reported that the deal was for at least 30 Boeing 777 and 787 jets, valued at about US$6.7 billion at list prices. Boeing declined to comment and Qatar Airways was not immediately available to comment. If the deal is finalized, it would give the Chicago-based planemaker a substantial sales boost amid a slump in widebody orders this year. It follows news on Wednesday that the United States had begun notifying lawmakers informally that it had approved the sales of 36 Boeing F-15 fighter jets to Qatar, valued at around US$4 billion. The United States also approved the sale of fighters to Kuwait. The sales to both states had been pending for more than two years amid concerns raised by Israel, Washington's closest Middle East ally, that they could be used against it, and criticism of Qatar for alleged ties to armed Islamist groups. Qatar Airways Chief Executive Officer Akbar Al Baker said in August that the airline planned to make a major aircraft order to enable its network expansion plans. In July the airline also said it was in advanced talks to purchase up to 30 of Boeing's 737 narrowbody planes. Earlier in the year, Qatar Airways refused to accept three Airbus A320neo narrowbody jets, because of engine cooling issues. The airline has canceled its first A320neo delivery and said it must source alternate planes to meet demand. Engine maker Pratt & Whitney said in March it expected the cooling problem and other software issues to be fixed this year. Airbus is struggling to keep up with deliveries to Qatar Airways of the long-haul Airbus A350 planes. Those delays, combined with the A320neo problems, has put Qatar Airways at risk of posting a loss in the fiscal year that ends in March, Al Baker said in August. "Our relationship is very strained," Al Baker said in August. "What's happening at Airbus with the deliveries is seriously affecting our growth."

Getty Images Related Media 10 Health-Care Plan Questions Employers Must Be Prepared to Answer Advertisement The Obama administration will compel employers with federal contracts to provide paid sick leave for workers and require all businesses to collect data on salary differences between men and women under two final rules issued Thursday. The first rule, which President Barack Obama announced last year, will require federal contractors to provide as many as seven days of paid sick leave for their employees. The White House said the rule will mean additional sick leave for more than 1 million people, including employees at top federal contractors such as Lockheed Martin Corp. and Boeing Co. The rule takes effect January 1, 19 days before Obama leaves office. “This rule means that the federal government is putting our money where our mouth is,” Obama said in an interview with Slate.com. “We know that providing at least seven paid sick days a year to our contracted workforce will give us the best value for taxpayer dollars and is good for workers and business alike.” Popular Now These Industries are the Future of Additive Manufacturing Ford Sees Bumps Ahead with Used-Car Glut, Trump Presidency What a President Trump Might Mean for the Internet of Things In a separate action, the Labor Department will require companies with more than 100 employees to report salary data broken down by gender, race and ethnicity for the first time. The rule, intended to encourage companies to combat pay gaps between workers of different genders or races, will affect about 60,000 employers, the White House said. Companies will have to report the data by March 31, 2018. The two rules stem from executive orders Obama has signed within the last 13 months, as he’s sought to expand his legacy on labor issues in the final months of his presidency. Congress has tried to delay implementation of a new regulation to expand overtime pay protections to 4 million workers, and 21 states filed a lawsuit against that rule this month.

The sales to Bahrain, Qatar and Kuwait can go ahead unless they are rejected by the US Congress. The Israeli government has used its influence to stall the sale of weapons to governments. An “informal notification” sent to the House and Senate foreign affairs committees on Wednesday begins an initial review that could last as long as 40 days, according to the officials, who asked not to be identified in advance of a formal announcement that will come later. That notice will trigger an official 30-day review. The aircraft sales will deliver on pledges by President Barack Obama and the Pentagon to bolster the weaponry of Sunni-led nations in the Middle East. Those allies were left angry and uneasy after the US agreed to a deal with their regional rival, Iran, to ease international economic sanctions in exchange for curbs on its nuclear programme. The notification to Congress says the potential sales include as many as 72 Boeing F-15 jets to Qatar and as many as 32 of the Chicago-based company’s F/A-18 E/F fighters to Kuwait, according to one of the people. Lockheed, based in Bethesda, Maryland, would be able to sell as many as 19 of its F-16s to Bahrain. Qatar lodged its proposal in July 2013, and Kuwait made its request in April 2015. Bahrain’s is more recent. The aircraft sales could be valued at as much as $12 billion for the planes, and $20 billion if spare parts, logistical support and munitions are included, according to Richard Abu Lafia, an aerospace analyst for the Teal Group in Fairfax, Virginia. He underscored that the sales would help keep open assembly lines for older planes, such as the one in St. Louis where Boeing builds the F-15, as US purchases shift to Lockheed’s new F-35. “These fourth-generation fighters have far more durability than anybody would have expected,” Abu Lafia said. “It’s a solid win for both Boeing and St. Louis. The F-15 could conceivably live to see a half-century.” Boeing was encouraged to finally see the sale progressing, said Scott Day, a company spokesman. “It’s nice to see the further movement on the fighter sales as they are part of the future of F-15, F/A-18 lines.” Lockheed spokesman Bill Phelps said in an e-mail that “it would be inappropriate to comment on the details of ongoing government-to-government discussions between the US and Bahrain.” More from Gulf Fighting rages in Yemen ahead of truce Oman court defers verdict in journalists’ case Yemen government disowns truce deal tags from this storyUnited States follow this tag on MGNIran follow this tag on MGNQatar follow this tag on MGNBahrain follow this tag on MGNKuwait follow this tag on MGN filed underGulfNewsNewsGulf tagsUnited States follow this tag on MGN+ MGNIran follow this tag on MGN+ MGNQatar follow this tag on MGN+ MGNBahrain follow this tag on MGN+ MGNKuwait follow this tag on MGN+ MGN Also In NewsA walk to beat diabetes blues Follow us Most Popular ViewedCommentedVideosGalleries 01Viral: Saudi man’s love poem to Ivanka Trump 02Baby placed at cliff edge for souvenir photo 03Oman tightens tourist visa rules Play Dubai Canal opens with fireworks Nov 09, 2016 Play US expatriates in Dubai on Trump's victory Nov 09, 2016 Play Prince Charles tours Humanitarian City in Dubai Nov 08, 2016 Play Dubai Canal bridge lights at night Nov 08, 2016 24Images Supermoon rises over UAE skyline Nov 14, 2016 19Images Aftershocks rattle New Zealand after big quake Nov 14, 2016 12Images Pics: UAE Tolerance March draws crowd in Dubai Nov 16, 2016 1Image Pakistan, China launch new trade route Nov 14, 2016 Gulf: Weather today today-weatherManama, Bahrain Kuwait CityMuscat, OmanDoha, QatarRiyadh, Saudi ArabiaSana'a, Yemen weather-volume Celcius Fahrenheit Essential reading UAE announces public, private sector holidays United Arab Emirates Why expats risk fines to live in bed spaces United Arab EmiratesJapanDubaiSharjah Viral: Saudi man’s love poem to Ivanka Trump United StatesSaudi Arabia 'Utter devastation' after New Zealand quakes United StatesIndiaPakistanUnited Kingdom Latest Comments Haneef Puttur wrote: He may be an expert.

International investigators released findings Wednesday saying the plane was shot down by a surface-to-air missiles that was transported into Ukraine from Russia. Turnbull said in addition to the Security Council, where Russia has used its veto power to block action, the Netherlands could take up its own prosecution of the case. “Every single one of those murdered victims killed by that missile brought in from Russia, fired with the knowledge of Russia, every single one of them demands justice and we will be tireless in our efforts to ensure that justice is done,” he said. The findings released Wednesday confirm an earlier investigation by the Dutch Safety Board that concluded Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17 was brought down by a Russian-made Buk missile, a claim Russia has denied. “It may be concluded MH17 was shot down by a 9M38 missile launched by a Buk, brought in from the territory of the Russian Federation,” said Wilbert Paulissen of the Dutch National Police. Paulissen said evidence shows that pro-Russian rebels requested the deployment of the surface-to-air missile to the village of Pervomaysk and reported its arrival in eastern Ukraine. But Russia has dismissed the Dutch-led investigation as subjective. “Russia is disappointed that the situation around the investigation of the Boeing crash is not changing,” Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said in a statement. “The conclusions of the Dutch Prosecutor’s office confirmed that the investigation is biased and politically motivated.” Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Major General Igor Konashenkov told the Interfax news agency, “All of the data presented today at the briefing by the investigation team has two main sources: the Internet and security services of Ukraine. Therefore, doubts are bound to be raised over the objectivity of this information, and, correspondingly, the conclusions based on it.” Zakharova said Russia offered to assist in the investigation but the investigators “removed Moscow from full participation,” relegating Russia to only a “minor role.” In a move aimed at preempting the new findings, Russian spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters earlier Wednesday that Russian radar data proved that no rocket was fired from within territory held by pro-Russian separatists in Ukraine. “The most important thing in today’s report is that the circle is narrowing and perhaps next year the international commission of inquiry will name the perpetrators of the crime,” Bogdan Petrenko, deputy director of the Ukrainian Institute of Extremism, told VOA. “Probably, after a final conclusion, it will be possible to take the Russian Federation to court. Of course, we are talking first and foremost about the relatives of the victims of the downed Boeing.” “The investigation, a trial in this case, is very important for Ukraine. It makes it possible to sue Russia according to several international conventions,” political analyst Olesya Yakhno-Belkovskaya told VOA. “One involves support and financing of terrorism. The results of the investigation of this tragedy are, in particular, proof of Russia’s actions in the east of the country — support and funding of military operations against Ukraine.” The U.S. Department of State said the findings support Secretary of State John Kerry’s statement days after the attack that the plane was downed by a BUK missile that was launched from an area controlled by Russian-backed rebels. “While nothing can take away the grief of those who lost loved ones on that tragic day, this announcement is another step toward bringing to justice those responsible for this outrageous attack,” said State Department spokesman John Kirby. Ukrainian forces and Russian-backed rebels were engaged in intense fighting in eastern Ukraine at the time of the crash. Ukraine reacts to findings Ukraine’s Foreign Ministry hailed the report as “an important milestone” that exposes Russia’s “direct involvement” in the missile attack. “This puts an end to all of Russia’s attempts to discredit activities of the Joint Investigation Team and conclusions by spreading distorted or fabricated information,” the ministry said. Malaysia called Wednesday for the perpetrators of the missile attack to be brought to justice. “Malaysia wants firm action to be taken,” said Prime Minister Najib Razak. “We have promised that those who were responsible for the downing of the aircraft will be brought to justice.” In addition to Russia’s consistent denial of any involvement in the crash, Moscow has claimed the airliner was downed either by a Ukrainian fighter jet or shot down from Ukrainian-held territory. But the evidence against that is overwhelming, military science analyst Justin Bronk of the London-based Royal United Services Institute said in an interview with VOA. “The rebels had been firing surface-to-air missiles regularly for months at all sorts of Ukrainian military aircraft. They did not have any official contact with air traffic control. So they basically have just taken delivery of a much more powerful missile system than they had had previously, and were shooting at whatever they could see. And they, unfortunately, happened to hit an airliner.” Netherlands chief prosecutor Fred Westerbeke said investigators have identified about 100 who were involved in the attack “one way or another.” He said, “A clear impression of the chain of command” must be established before it can be determined if they are culpable. The report, which stopped short of concluding Russian soldiers were involved, was prepared by prosecutors from Australia, Belgium, Malaysia, the Netherlands and Ukraine. The report’s findings were based on thousands of pieces of evidence, including wiretaps, photographs, witness statements and forensics tests that were gathered over a more than two year period. Possible criminal trial Investigators say the latest findings, in addition to those from an earlier investigation, may be solid enough to be used in a criminal trial. Prosecutors cannot file charges at this time because international investigators have not agreed in which court to hold a trial. The previous investigation identified a 320-square kilometer area where it said the rocket launch must have taken place. Authorities did not explicitly say who had fired it, although all the land was controlled by pro-Russian separatists fighting Ukrainian forces. In a move aimed at preempting the new findings, Russia on Wednesday said its radar data proved that no rocket was fired from within territory held by pro-Russian separatists in Ukraine. On a conference call with reporters, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russian radar identified all flying objects over the rebel territory, and there was no rocket. “The data are clear-cut…there is no rocket,” he said. “If there was a rocket, it could only have been fired from elsewhere.” All 298 passengers on the Boeing 777 died after it broke apart in mid-air while traveling from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. The downing of the plane was a major factor in a decision by the European Union and the United States to impose sanctions on Russia, leading to a rise in East-West tensions to levels not seen since the end of the Cold War in 1991.

They said the missile launcher was brought into Ukraine from Russia and later returned there. All 298 people on board the Boeing 777 died when it broke apart in midair flying from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur. Prosecutors said they were not accusing Russia of involvement. They said there were 100 people “linked to the crash or the transport of the Buk” missile, but they are yet to determine who could be held criminally responsible. There is a need to establish who gave the order to move the missile launcher into eastern Ukraine, and where the order for it to be fired came from, investigators said. Russia has disputed claims that the missile was fired by rebels in eastern Ukraine. The Dutch-led Joint Investigation Team (JIT) consists of prosecutors from the Netherlands, Australia, Belgium, Malaysia and Ukraine. They have narrowed the missile launch site down to a specific field near the village of Pervomaiskyi. “Based on the criminal investigation, we have concluded that flight MH17 was downed by a Buk missile of the series 9M83 that came from the territory of the Russian Federation,” chief Dutch police investigator Wilbert Paulissen said.  The missile launcher was later taken back to Russia, he said. An inquiry by the Dutch Safety Board last year found that a Russian-made Buk missile hit the plane but did not say where it was fired from. The JIT investigation’s findings are meant to prepare the ground for a criminal trial but suspects will not be named. Prosecutors played recordings from intercepted phone calls during their news conference. They said witnesses reported seeing the missile launcher move from Russia into Ukraine and presented pictures and videos. The launch site was pinpointed by “many witnesses”, prosecutors said. Relatives were briefed before the JIT released their preliminary findings.  “They told us how the Buk was transported [and] how they came to that evidence from phone taps, photo, film material, video,” Robby Oehler, whose niece was killed in the crash, told the BBC. Separatist rebels have denied they were involved. “We never had such air defence systems, nor the people who could operate them,” Eduard Basurin, military deputy operational commander at the rebel Donetsk People’s Republic, told the Interfax news agency. “Therefore we could not have shot down the Boeing [flight MH17].” Earlier this week, Russia said it had radar data showing that the missile was not fired from rebel-held territory. The JIT does not yet have access to that data, prosecutors said.  AFP reports from Nieuwein, Netherlands adds:  A criminal inquiry into the downing of Flight MH17 said Wednesday it is investigating 100 people for a missile attack on the plane two years ago over eastern Ukraine, saying the system used had been transported from Russia. The investigators also confirmed that the BUK missile which slammed into the Malaysia Airlines plane was fired from a field in a part of eastern Ukraine which at the time was under the control of pro-Russia separatists. The Boeing 777 passenger jet was brought down over rebel-held eastern Ukraine in July 2014 on a routine flight from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur, killing all 298 people on board including 196 Dutch citizens. “Our investigation has shown that the location from where the BUK was fired was in the hands of the Russian separatists,” said Wilbert Paulissen, the head of the Dutch police investigation. The joint investigation “has identified approximately 100 people who can be linked to the downing of MH17 or the transport of the BUK-TELAR” missile system, Dutch prosecutors said.

They also narrowed down the area it was fired from to a field in territory controlled by Russian-backed rebels. All 298 people on board the Boeing 777 died when it broke apart in mid-air flying from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur. Russia said it could not accept the findings as the final truth, saying no Russian weapons were taken to Ukraine. “Based on the criminal investigation, we have concluded that flight MH17 was downed by a Buk missile of the series 9M83 that came from the territory of the Russian Federation,” chief Dutch police investigator Wilbert Paulissen told a news conference yesterday. The missile had been taken from Russia to rebel-held Ukraine in the morning of 17 July, when the plane was shot down, and the launcher was taken back to Russia the next day, he said. The Dutch-led Joint Investigation Team (JIT) has also narrowed the missile launch site down to a specific field near the village of Pervomaiskyi, which was then in rebel hands. n an interview with the BBC, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said there was “nothing to accept or deny”, as he understood these were preliminary findings. “We cannot accept as final truth of what they say. I bet you haven’t seen any proof of what they say,” he told the Hardtalk programme, adding: “We know the devil is in the detail, and we are still missing lot of the detail.” But he appeared to rule out that the missile came from Russia: “We’ve been ruling out the fact that any Russian weapons were shipped to Ukraine, any Russian army members, any Russian troops were inside Ukraine. And we’re still ruling out that possibility.” Ukraine’s President Petro Poroshenko hailed the inquiry’s initial findings, saying: “We have solid proof of who is to blame for this dreadful crime.” Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte called the preliminary findings “an important step on the road to the ultimate goal: finding and prosecuting the perpetrators”, whereas the Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak said his country sought “firm action” so that those responsible “will be brought to justice”. Near the village of Hrabove, where a large section of the Boeing 777 had come down, we soon found bodies scattered in the fields and a pile of suitcases by the side of the road. A child’s diary lay open on the ground. The intense heat from the crash had melted part of one of the wings and a section of human backbone lay in the ashes. For the families of the 298 people killed when MH17 was shot down, today’s report is a step forward in their long, frustrating quest to see those responsible brought to justice. The confirmation that the missile launcher had been sent from Russia implies that Russian soldiers could have been involved at least in the transportation and possibly in the firing of the rocket. But prosecutors admitted they did not know who gave the order to shoot the plane down. And while there is a determination to prosecute those responsible, it is very unclear that this will ever be possible, particularly if it would require Moscow to hand over suspects. Separatist rebels have denied they were involved. “We never had such air defence systems, nor the people who could operate them,” Eduard Basurin, military deputy operational commander at the rebel Donetsk People’s Republic, told the Interfax news agency. “Therefore we could not have shot down the Boeing [flight MH17].” An inquiry by the Dutch Safety Board last year found that a Russian-made Buk missile hit the plane but was not specific about where the launch site could have been. Earlier this week, Russia said it had radar data showing that the missile was not fired from rebel-held territory. Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?

The plane not only brought a full load of 180 passengers from Ireland to the Connecticut River Valley, but it also heralded the return of long sought-after transatlantic service to Bradley and what economic development officials in Connecticut, Massachusetts and Ireland see as a growing market for business and recreational travel. Jack Foley, Aer Lingus executive vice president for North America, told the crowd Wednesday that he expects to be back here in a year or so to say Aer Lingus is now flying the route with a larger aircraft, not the midsize Boeing 757s it is using now. "As of now, ticket sales have exceeded our projections. We don't release numbers, but sales are exceeding our projections," Foley said afterward in a brief interview before boarding the plane. "And we are especially exceeding expectations when it comes to the all-important business travel market." Kevin Dillon, executive director of the Connecticut Airport Authority and head of Bradley, said the next few Aer Linigus flights are booked solid. "With service like this, it always takes about six months to really figure out where you are and how well it is received," he said. "But Aer Lingus is very happy and we are continuing to reach out and let people know the service is available." Flights leave Bradley at 6:10 p.m. daily, arriving in Dublin at 5:20 a.m. the following day. Return flights will leave Dublin at 2:20 p.m. and arrive back in Connecticut at 4:20 p.m. To get the Aer Lingus service, the state of Connecticut made revenue guarantees of $9 million over two years to the airline, Dillon said. That means if revenue on the line falls short of benchmarks in that time period, Connecticut makes up the difference. Aer Lingus — the name means "air fleet" in Irish — is advertising the flights, round trip, from $497. Airlines like Aer Lingus need a load factor of at least 85 percent in order to run a route economically. That means on the Boeing 757 airliners Aer Lingus will use here, executives expect that at least 153 seats will be filled. "In the last five years we have been the fastest-growing airline over the Atlantic," Foley said. "And we have done that being profitable." Aer Lingus is not just expanding into Connecticut. The Irish airline started flying to Los Angeles in May and will add service to Newark, New Jersey, this month concurrently with Bradley. And Aer Lingus is not just selling Ireland. The flights to Dublin connect with flights to 25 cities across Europe including London, Berlin and Warsaw. "It is really a connection with all of Europe," said Timothy Brennan, executive director of the Pioneer Valley Regional Planning Commission. "This is a major boost for the Capital Region of Connecticut and for Springfield." WINDSOR LOCKS, Conn. -- The first Aer Lingus flight from Dublin to Bradley International Airport in Windsor Locks arrives Wednesday.(Jim Kinney / The Republican)   Bradley is selling Aer Lingus to the traveling public on the convenience factor of coming and going from Bradley instead of Kennedy airport in New York or Logan in Boston. "That was always the worst part of making the trip," said Tony Sheridan of Waterford, Connecticut, before he boarded the flight to Dublin. "I've been traveling to Ireland for 50 years, almost every year, and getting to Kennedy or Logan is always the worst part." Added to that ease of travel is that Aer Lingus passengers pre-clear customs in Dublin. They arrive at Bradley just as a domestic passenger would. No long waits at the airport. Sheridan, who grew up near Dublin, is president of the Chamber of Commerce of Eastern Connecticut. He led a group of 30 business people over to Dublin on the flight along with Connecticut's top tourism officials. His focus is on southern Connecticut. "We can promote all of Mystic Country," he said. "The aquarium, the casinos." Foley said he has a group of Irish tour group operators flying in later this week for a 10-day stay. They'll get a taste of Connecticut and Massachusetts, including the Berkshires in fall, he said. Sheridan said tourism will flow both ways. Forty million Americans claim some Irish heritage, he said. Marlene Ferreira of Enfield, Connecticut, flew to Dublin Wednesday night for a quick weekend. She knows some people taking the flight for business and taged along. "But we'll be using it again," she said. "We'll use the flight next year to connect with Portugual. We go every year." Brennan said business travelers will really appreciate the convenience of close-by international travel. "It opens a door," Brennnan said. "It opens a door to all of Europe."

She accused the Joint Investigative Taskforce of "arbitrarily designating a guilty party and inventing the desired results." The taskforce presented its findings on Wednesday after a two-year investigation into the crash of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 in conflict-torn eastern Ukraine, which killed all 298 people on board in July 2014. RELATED READING Investigation finds MH17 downed from pro-Russia rebel held territory International prosecutors investigating the downing of a Malaysian airliner two years ago have concluded it was shot down by a Russian-made missile fired from rebel-held territory in eastern Ukraine, victims' family members said on Wednesday. The conclusion did not assign blame but said the Boeing 777 was shot down by a BUK missile system from an area in eastern Ukraine controlled by pro-Russian separatists, and that the system was brought in from Russia and then taken back there. The ministry statement said the taskforce "excluded Moscow from fully participating in the investigation process" while embracing Ukraine as a "full member of the JIT" and giving Kiev an opportunity to "falsify evidence and twist the case in its favour". "Russia is practically the only (party) that sends true information and discloses more and more new data," the statement said. Yet the "whole 'body of evidence' of the Dutch prosecutors was provided by Ukraine," it said. The taskforce said Wednesday that Moscow had only provided part of the information that it had requested. Russia's defence ministry on Monday released what it claimed were new radar images showing that there was no missile fired from rebel-held territory on that day, which contradicted some of its earlier declarations. Russia's Almaz-Antey missile maker, which produces BUK surface-to-air systems, said in a briefing Wednesday that the inquiry did not include its findings. The state-controlled firm last October alleged the plane was downed from disputed territory by an outdated version of the BUK missile that is no longer in use by the Russian military. Dutch prosecutors said they only received Almaz-Antey's data this month and did not find that it outweighed the probe's conclusions.

Doug Hurley Eric both Sonny Williams and myself Bob Franken are all assigned to work with those basics and mowing the develop the next vehicles that we'll take astronauts of the International Space Station. What are we doing okay today we're rolling out a simulator that Boeing has provided its part task trainer that will allow us to simulate the CST 100. The start wondered their vehicle that's gonna rotate crewmembers to the International Space Station. All right let's get going okay what what I can do. From my seats which is kind of a new capability it that we haven't had until now for CST one utter. Are hardliners actually taking. Similar to run and actually runs through an ascent profile. So I can see and monitor the vehicle's performance to make sure that we're getting into orbit and make sure all systems are functioning and I'm not about to be faced with an emergency scenario like Villa rescue training team likes to put in there for us. And make her way to orbit safely as I monitoring the systems. In the simulator from the scene and I can take us to freeze and stop things I think you could probably hear the acoustics of the the engine firing him below us as we launched towards space station in the first stage. Why monitor the performance and bring it back into run if I needed check procedure make sure I understood what was going on I could actually do that and enough pick up where it left off. Historically if you ran a simulator like this might take an entire control room to kind of cloth and executed it's really important for us and I wanna deal was sealed on these cases and be ready when the time comes I just have the timing down perfectly and author myself quite a few times much like an app on your phone or otherwise I concerns stop at my convenience. Make sure that I understand things and and pick up where it left off. At the same time the flight control team needs to understand what's happening with the vehicle can do the same thing they can come and sit down and understand the vehicle and get themselves prepared before we go to a large group. Do a simulation and prepare for watching it space. By the time you actually fly the star liner in 2018. How many hours of training like this do you think you have done it's it's just to be hundreds isn't. That's a great question and I think it I knew the answer to right now I would. And I could probably set up my own old fashioned 1900 number and and be able to predict where the stars were gonna alignments. Think it will be hundreds of hours for space shuttle we had. Probably three quarters of our training time was focused on being prepared for ascent and entry and I would expect that for some of the crew members will have a significant training. Workload in terms of being right but I do know for sure is going to be quite a bit less than it was for the for the space shuttle. As you can see just by house on the cockpit is with a vehicle accident. Folks actually I'm not quite tall enough to make this shot work so let's go back instead of CE inside the space shuttle. He just a quick search on line you can probably find out that there were thousands and thousands of switches on board the space shuttle. We've just got handfuls witches and caught right in front of a single remember. It physically it was impossible to beat Lindsay on this issue and reach everything that I needed to be reached even on assets when it as a time critical face. Here here marks an uphill you may require. Three or crew members to be able to reach all the things that could possibly. Here telephone of one person much smaller vehicles entry via. And it blasts. Vehicles much more automated than his facial lines have been a lot of advances since the sixties and seventies and so underwent is designed. The new vehicles that we have coming forward from mowing and SpaceX sir I'm very very much automated. The crews and the positions. To take over if something isn't performing as it's expected. To make sure that the computer isn't completely control your destiny you have some capability continue to do something safe and over. But that's one huge advancements. Looking ships will not. Only fat the star liner sort of a blast of past because. It will look like an Apollo capsule but it's really not an Apollo capsule because the technology has changed and talk to me about what's going to be different invests them in the Apollo as the campus to the moon. One one of the things that is true is that physics and change. From the holidays where we are right now so the outer mold lines of the vehicles need to be about the same and make it Indus basin and make it safely back through the atmosphere so that physics is exactly the same. What is different. Is the technology from a computer perspective that can be on board the amount of things they say now can be accomplished by itself on. Network which has much more computational capability can handle for the computers that Rob Portman Apollo so he's to have to all be done in the mind of of the crew member. With some digital numbers being displayed tone in. A lot of mathematics and training that went into making them prepared to turn those things into the appropriate action packed him off the automated now computer can do a lot more of those things that's really the biggest difference is that the computer capabilities are much better. You can be landing on my hands this is fit to plan is for is to come down you'll transfer water back to come down and you talk actually talk to about. Economics is that why do you want lamb what does landing on lamb imports. Here I think it's in this case for the Boeing designed landing on and this in general is always better because the complexity of the operation post landing as it is simpler so. Some more than truck and drive up that pick up the capsule take the crew taken where they need to go. You need to shift in a lot of coordination could go find somebody in the in the open ocean so the complexities a lot simpler and the environment that the capsule goes through is a lot. Work clean lot more pristine if you actually land on my end. You don't have enough salt water to deal with you don't have to have a vehicle that used to be robust than that and it does allow the vehicle to potentially be reviews and I think that that's. That's part of DC. The cost effectiveness. Pointed doubling its trying to get to visit the of the people listen make it back to land it's a little bit harder to refurbish once it's been through that saltwater environment. You won't be you. I need cash not that you've flown shadowed U Penn Station and now we did this I mean this is almost three generations vehicles. Talking a little bit about you know one of the things that was really interesting to me when I arrived at NASA and that 2000 is how little. For thinking we can hand me and had a and and it rightly so we were focused on building the space station but we didn't have a lot of a longer term plans in terms of what the astronauts were going to do next. I'm past sixteen years later fast forward. Space shuttles retired we've got. CSC 100 this airliner we've got the dragon vehicle we've got a lioness Alaska got a lot of vehicles in the next that are are coming forward and so for me. I would say it's probably the most exciting time you know in my life time to be an astronaut we are elated on the moon when I was born and so this is. Might chance to be a part of a space program that's. Pretty exciting right now three new vehicles is more than any of us have had through the entire rest of our career. Going to different places a couple of the space station and a couple of for one further out and so that makes a big difference makes for exciting times tonight and it's really it's really awesome into the apartment. And the options are catching an asteroid. I mean Mars everyone's talking about Mars these days possibly going back to mom. If you could design dream mission what would your dream mission indeed you know among might trade mission is just to continue the explorations all those destinations you meant. Mentioned there are great one's going to the moon is a great place going to Mars is a great place. Going to retrieve an asteroid or visiting heads or or even. It's a Hubble space telescope those were great nation so. All those expiration destinations and kind of facilitating that exploration. And understanding that Europe piece of that. That that outward stepping the human race into the solar system is this something I'm just excited to be a part of itself to save it what's your dream mission and I can't do all hum. You just. Did you Huard talked to Scott Kelly who recently returned from a his one year mission even he would say he realizes that he can't do every mission that's out there and space he had a great one. But there are lots of great ones and we're all just lucky to beat here at a time when things like that are happening when artery nations and us. And we're looking at 2018 launch and this won't get US astronauts back on US don't spacecraft. How important is that to you you know thanks for thanks for admission that point that's probably the point that I should have mentioned when I said hey what's the I was my idea of a dream mission I would say that as a student that's responsible if you ask. Anybody who is there what they thought their dream that assessment would hurt a sign it would be it would be testing a new station and I get to be that. And then on top of that I get to be one of the folks it's gonna bring commercial. Space flight back to the Florida coast and will be launching Americans from American soil. As the chief of NASA's astronaut office has been quite a bit of time traveling back and forth in Kazakhstan I'd probably. Over four years did. More than a dozen trips. Somebody that I lost count and one of my goals was to make sure that is media astronauts and that made that pilgrimage to house Exxon has until we get. Crew members to space station right now that's how we get and is based. And I wanted to mall to be thankful. For the timely launch from again off the Florida coast and so. Those that time is coming up quick I think I'm going as a recording 120 team is that timeframe to be ready take as the space station and that. Dream mission to the apartment and that's right now right now. Thank you Herman's we appreciate your time and the time this year he opening of this are pestering her with us.

Close share panel Image copyright AFP Image caption Prosecutors said the missile was brought into Ukraine from Russia International prosecutors say Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 was downed over eastern Ukraine in 2014 by a Buk missile that had come from Russia. They also narrowed down the area it was fired from to a field in territory controlled by Russian-backed rebels. All 298 people on board the Boeing 777 died when it broke apart in mid-air flying from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur. Russia says it cannot accept the findings as the final truth, saying no Russian weapons were taken to Ukraine. "Based on the criminal investigation, we have concluded that flight MH17 was downed by a Buk missile of the series 9M83 that came from the territory of the Russian Federation," chief Dutch police investigator Wilbert Paulissen told a news conference on Wednesday. MH17 Malaysia plane crash: What we know MH17 crash: The 298 who perished The missile had been taken from Russia to rebel-held Ukraine in the morning of 17 July, when the plane was shot down, and the launcher was taken back to Russia the next day, he said. The Dutch-led Joint Investigation Team (JIT) has also narrowed the missile launch site down to a specific field near the village of Pervomaiskyi, which was then in rebel hands. Media captionProsecutors played recordings from intercepted phone calls during the news conference In an interview with the BBC, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said there was "nothing to accept or deny", as he understood these were preliminary findings. "We cannot accept as final truth of what they say. I bet you haven't seen any proof of what they say," he told the Hardtalk programme, adding: "We know the devil is in the detail, and we are still missing lot of the detail." But he appeared to rule out that the missile came from Russia: "We've been ruling out the fact that any Russian weapons were shipped to Ukraine, any Russian army members, any Russian troops were inside Ukraine. And we're still ruling out that possibility." Ukraine's President Petro Poroshenko hailed the inquiry's initial findings, saying: "We have solid proof of who is to blame for this dreadful crime." Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte called the preliminary findings "an important step on the road to the ultimate goal: finding and prosecuting the perpetrators", whereas the Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak said his country sought "firm action" so that those responsible "will be brought to justice". Media captionThere are still lots of unclear things and lots of contradictions says Dmitry Peskov Who gave the order? Justice is exactly what the relatives of the victims want. "Apart from wanting to know exactly what weapon was used and where it was fired from, we also want an answer as to where we go from here," said Evert van Zijtveld, who lost his 18-year-old son Robert-Jan and daughter Frederique, 19, in the tragedy. "We want to see the perpetrators caught and put on trial," he told the AFP news agency. JIT prosecutors have established the identities of about 100 people "linked to the crash or the transport of the Buk" missile, but they are yet to determine who could be held criminally responsible. They will need to establish who gave the order to move the missile launcher into eastern Ukraine, and where the order for it to be fired came from. All of this will take time, they say. Media captionHow does a BUK missile system work? Many witnesses Prosecutors played recordings from intercepted phone calls during their news conference. They said witnesses reported seeing the missile launcher move from Russia into Ukraine and presented pictures and videos. The launch site was pinpointed by "many witnesses", prosecutors said. Image copyright Reuters A long, frustrating quest - Richard Galpin, BBC News Near the village of Hrabove, where a large section of the Boeing 777 had come down, we soon found bodies scattered in the fields and a pile of suitcases by the side of the road. A child's diary lay open on the ground. The intense heat from the crash had melted part of one of the wings and a section of human backbone lay in the ashes. For the families of the 298 people killed when MH17 was shot down, today's report is a step forward in their long, frustrating quest to see those responsible brought to justice. The confirmation that the missile launcher had been sent from Russia implies that Russian soldiers could have been involved at least in the transportation and possibly in the firing of the rocket. But prosecutors admit they do not know who gave the order to shoot the plane down. And while there is a determination to prosecute those responsible, it is very unclear that this will ever be possible, particularly if it would require Moscow to hand over suspects. Image copyright Reuters Separatist rebels have denied they were involved. "We never had such air defence systems, nor the people who could operate them," Eduard Basurin, military deputy operational commander at the rebel Donetsk People's Republic, told the Interfax news agency. "Therefore we could not have shot down the Boeing [flight MH17]." An inquiry by the Dutch Safety Board last year found that a Russian-made Buk missile hit the plane but was not specific about where the launch site could have been. Earlier this week, Russia said it had radar data showing that the missile was not fired from rebel-held territory. The JIT does not yet have access to that data, prosecutors said. Russia's changing story In the two years since MH17 was shot down, Russian officials have presented several theories about what happened. Image copyright EPA Image caption This week, Russia presented radar images which it said showed the missile could not have been fired from rebel territory 21 July 2014: Four days after the tragedy, Russia's defence ministry presented satellite photos and other images suggesting it was downed by a Ukrainian surface-to-air Buk missile or a Ukrainian military jet June 2015: Russia's Investigations Committee named a "key witness" - a Ukrainian "aircraft ordnance technician" - who claimed that the Boeing was downed by a Ukrainian Su-25 fighter October 2015: Buk missile producer Almaz-Antey said that the plane was indeed downed by a Buk, but an old one - which Russia no longer had in its arsenal September 2016: Russia's defence ministry released what it said were radar data suggesting MH17 was shot down by a missile, but not one fired by Russian-backed rebels Russia's changing version of events Related Topics Russia Netherlands Ukraine crisis Share this story About sharing Email Facebook Messenger Messenger Twitter Pinterest WhatsApp Linkedin More on this story MH17 Ukraine plane crash: What we know 28 September 2016 The 298 who perished on MH17 28 July 2014 A tale of two sisters 9 July 2015 History of downed passenger planes 20 July 2014 Top Stories Trump gives Sessions top law job US President-elect Donald Trump has given conservative ally Jeff Sessions the attorney general post. 18 November 2016 Scots and Welsh to get say on Brexit case 18 November 2016 'No, I didn't marry a snake' - fireman 18 November 2016 Features & Analysis An empty seat Remembering man whose death was filmed on Facebook Trump is coming Run away!

"Russia is disappointed that the situation around the investigation of the Boeing catastrophe is not changing," foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said in a statement. "The conclusions of Dutch prosecutors confirm that the investigation is biased and politically motivated," she said. She accused the Joint Investigative Taskforce of "arbitrarily designating a guilty party and inventing the desired results." The taskforce presented its findings on Wednesday after a two-year investigation into the crash of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 in conflict-torn eastern Ukraine, which killed all 298 people on board in July 2014. The conclusion did not assign blame but said the Boeing 777 was shot down by a BUK missile system from an area in eastern Ukraine controlled by pro-Russian separatists, and that the system was brought in from Russia and then taken back there. The ministry statement said the taskforce "excluded Moscow from fully participating in the investigation process" while embracing Ukraine as a "full member of the JIT" and giving Kiev an opportunity to "falsify evidence and twist the case in its favour". "Russia is practically the only (party) that sends true information and discloses more and more new data," the statement said. Yet the "whole 'body of evidence' of the Dutch prosecutors was provided by Ukraine," it said. The taskforce said Wednesday that Moscow had only provided part of the information that it had requested. Russia's defence ministry on Monday released what it claimed were new radar images showing that there was no missile fired from rebel-held territory on that day, which contradicted some of its earlier declarations. Russia's Almaz-Antey missile maker, which produces BUK surface-to-air systems, said in a briefing Wednesday that the inquiry did not include its findings. The state-controlled firm last October alleged the plane was downed from disputed territory by an outdated version of the BUK missile that is no longer in use by the Russian military. Dutch prosecutors said they only received Almaz-Antey's data this month and did not find that it outweighed the probe's conclusions.

Fuller Korean Air's aerospace division and Boeing have renewed a project to convert some South Korean military helicopters into unmanned aerial systems (UAS). The companies signed a memorandum of agreement at Korean Air's Seoul headquarters last week, according to a company press release. The agreement calls for the development of unmanned aircraft by converting MH 500MD Defense helicopters. Per the agreement, Boeing will provide technical support for flight control and other data, as well as for test evaluations. Both companies are also set to implement an overseas joint marketing program. This agreement comes after Korean Air successfully completed a remodel of the ROK Air Force's retired 500MDs to unmanned rotorcraft from 2014 to May of this year. Now, Korean Air has launched a new project to remodel the 500MDs into unmanned, armed aircraft. The project will run until 2017. The combat aircraft will be able to perform day and night reconnaissance and surveillance missions, as well as conduct short-distance precision strikes.

They said the missile launcher was brought into Ukraine from Russia and returned back after hitting the plane. The prosecutors claim they would investigate about 100 people over the incident, but didn't give any names yes. As reported earlier, according to Dutch media, Joint Investigation Team (JIT) concluded that the "Buk" launcher, which downed Malaysian Boeing in Donbas, was brought into the territory of Ukraine from Russia. This is stated in a preliminary conclusion of the JIT, given by the prosecutor Fred Westerbeke to the relatives of the passengers, killed in the plane crash. Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 was hit by a surface-to-air missile while en route from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur and all 298 people aboard were killed. At the time of the disaster, Ukrainian government forces were engaged in heavy fighting with Russia-controlled separatists. The Boeing 777 broke apart in midair, flinging wreckage over several kilometres of fields in the militant-held territory. The incident played a significant part in a decision by the European Union and the United States to impose sanctions on Russia over the Ukraine conflict, and East-West tensions escalated to levels not seen since the end of Cold War. As Ukraine Today reported, the team of prosecutors from the Netherlands, Australia, Belgium, Malaysia and Ukraine planned a news conference at 11:00 GMT (14:00 Kyiv time) to deliver conclusions "with regard to the weapon that was used to bring down Flight MH17 and the precise location from which this weapon was launched", a group statement said. Read also UT special project From Russia With Love on the Kremlin involvement in Donbas War and particularly on circumstances of MH17 tragedy. Ukrainian and Western officials, citing intelligence intercepts, have blamed Russian-backed rebels for the incident. Russia has always denied direct involvement in the Ukraine conflict and rejects responsibility for the destruction of MH17, but blamed Ukraine for the disaster and also for obstructing the MH17 investigation. A civilian investigation into the cause of the July 17, 2014, incident conducted by the Dutch Safety Board concluded last year that the airliner had been downed by a Russian-made ‘Buk' missile, which was brought from Russia and launched from eastern Ukraine. But the board was not tasked with assigning blame, and prosecutors must conduct their own investigation if evidence assembled is ever to be used in court. Dutch prosecutors have sought legal assistance from Moscow since October 2014, and visited in person for a week in July, but "Russian authorities … have not answered all questions," and even blocked MH17 crash probes, so they had to be extended for another 9 months. State-backed Russian TV report on MH17 was also discredited for use of fake photos. A Kremlin-backed militant leader even claimed personally witnessing Ukrainian aircraft shooting down MH17, but current Russian official position proved the previous ones were a fake. Independent investigators like Bellingcat group presented their own conclusions and even photos of Russian Buk missile system, which had allegedly downed MH17. In 2015 Malaysian, Australian, Dutch, Belgian and Ukrainian delegations proposed a United Nations-backed tribunal to prosecute the case, but Russia cast a veto in the UN Security Council to block the motion. This decision was condemned by global leaders.  Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href="http://disqus.com/?ref_noscript">comments powered by Disqus.</a> comments powered by Disqus RELATED NEWS Crime12:19 Nov. 18, 2016 Offence against Shyrokyne, Hnutove and Troitske with 122mm artillery Crime11:28 Nov. 18, 2016 OSCE warns about a possible attack on Mariupol Crime19:25 Nov. 17, 2016 Bulgarian ex-minister charged over nuclear project Crime17:28 Nov. 16, 2016 Ukraine's cyber police shut down one of the biggest pirate movie websites Crime17:06 Nov. 16, 2016 Artillery fire towards Shyrokyne again See more news Tweets by @uatodaytv Ukraine Today WEEKLY DIGEST Subscribe to receive regular email updates about Ukraine and Eastern Europe Copyright © 2014News|Live|Politics|Business|Entertainment|Crime|Tech&Science|Society|Sport|Opinion|About Privacy policy Communicate Follow Follow @uatodaytv Subscribe vk154998

Britons' growing appetite for winter sun also gave TUI, Europe's largest tour operator, confidence for the coming year in its trading update on Wednesday. Turkey's popularity as a holiday destination has plunged following an attack on tourists in Istanbul in January and a failed coup in July, forcing tour operators such as TUI and Thomas Cook to rapidly add more flights and hotels in alternatives such as Spain and Portugal. TUI's operation of the long-haul Boeing Dreamliner 787 aircraft, of which it over 10, has also given it an advantage over Thomas Cook, in an environment where holidaymakers are going further afield to find winter sun. "Where they've (TUI) been a bit more differentiated particularly for winter is looking to put on this additional long-haul product with new 787s," Cenkos analyst Simon French said. TUI is the only leisure airline to operate Boeing's Dreamliner, an aircraft which it says is highly rated by customers. TUI said that it would deliver underlying profit growth (EBITA) of between 12 and 13 percent at constant currency rates in the 12 months ended Sept. 30, compared to an August forecast for growth of at least 10 percent. That performance was driven by a 5 percent rise in bookings from the UK over the summer, as Britons defied worries that a devaluation of the pound since the country's June 23 vote for Brexit would deter people from going on holidays abroad. TUI's shares rose 2 percent to 1,108 pence 0915 GMT, hitting their highest level since February and cementing a recovery from a low of 813 pence on the day the Brexit result was announced. There was also strong British demand for holidays for the 2016/17 winter period, TUI said, with bookings up 22 percent as customers, who due to security concerns in nearer winter sun destinations such as Egypt and Tunisia, opted to go on long-haul holidays to places like Mexico, the Caribbean and Sri Lanka. "You've still got a very difficult geo-political backdrop but these companies and customers are getting more adept at dealing with that," French said, referring to the security issues in some formerly popular destinations. Overall, winter trading was in line with its expectations, TUI said, adding that it had fired the starting gun on the sale of its specialist holiday arm Travelopia, worth a potential 500-600 million euros.

Boeing unveils deal to boost Moroccan aerospace industry Associated Press Twitter Facebook Email Reddit TANGIERS, Morocco – Boeing Co. has signed an agreement with Morocco’s government that the North African kingdom hopes will create 8,000 jobs and an additional $1 billion a year in export revenue. Boeing said it will support a Moroccan plan to build up its aerospace manufacturing sector, encouraging suppliers to set up or expand here. With a high-quality but cheap workforce, Morocco’s aerospace sector has developed rapidly over the past decade. King Mohammed VI oversaw the signing Tuesday in Tangiers. Said Boeing Commercial Airplanes CEO Raymond Conner: “We and our suppliers must reduce costs and improve quality in order to win in the marketplace.” Moroccan Industry Minister Hafid El Alamy said Morocco hopes to bring 120 Boeing suppliers here.

Sponsored by the Automation Network Dresden (AND), the conference featured speakers from Boeing Spectrolab, SolarWorld, Texas Instruments, Intel, Cimetrix, Meyer Burger and Agilion GmbH, among others. The conference touched on a broad range of timely topics. Speakers from Texas Instruments and Fabmatics GmbH discussed successful automation efforts both in mature 200mm fabs and with automation-averse tools. Intel discussed their efforts to drive increased diversity among their manufacturing suppliers and how their RealSense hardware and depth-perception software can be leveraged into automation workflows. Efforts to drive big data analytics and IoT to the factory floor were presented by both Dresden University of Technology and Agilion GmbH. Other topics included the role of equipment data models in semiconductor production systems, SAP process automation in the manufacturing environment, and overviews from industry experts about the latest trends and the future of photovoltaic and IC manufacturing. Every year at the evening event, the Automation Network Dresden awards the "Innovation Award for Automation" to a leader in manufacturing automation. This year the award was presented to SolarWorld for their cutting-edge migration of a high-volume manufacturing execution system (MES) to a cloud platform. Travis Stevens, president of SYSTEMA USA Corporation, described this year's event as "Successful the feedback was positive. I know of no other event in the US that is specifically dedicated to bringing manufacturing experts together to discuss the latest innovations in the semiconductor automation solution space. We look forward to bringing this unique opportunity to the US again in the future." The Automation Network Dresden is a consortium of four Dresden-based companies AIS Automation Dresden GmbH, Fabmatics GmbH (formerly HAP GmbH and Roth Rau Ortner GmbH), SYSTEMA GmbH and XENON GmbH all of which are premier experts in automation through software and hardware. The next innovationsforum for automation will take place in Dresden on January 19-20, 2017.

Photo: Reuters mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 4:15 AM, September 30, 2016 Updated: 8:00 AM, September 30, 2016 Qatar Airways is in late-stage talks to buy at least 30 Boeing Co <BA.N> wide-body jets, valued at more than $6.7 billion at list prices, Bloomberg reported, citing people familiar with the matter. The order, which follows the U.S. approval of a long-stalled sale of Boeing F-15 fighter jets to Qatar, would include 787 Dreamliners and 777 planes for the country's flagship airline, Bloomberg reported. (http://bloom.bg/2dnOVra) Reuters reported on Wednesday that U.S. officials began notifying lawmakers informally about the sale of 36 Boeing F-15 fighter jets to Qatar valued at around $4 billion, and 28 F/A- 18E/F Super Hornets, plus options for 12 more, to Kuwait for around $3 billion. Boeing declined to comment and Qatar Airways was not immediately available to comment. Qatar Airways is the largest customer of Airbus Group SE's <AIR.PA> A350 plane, a mid-sized carbon-composite jetliner designed to compete with the Boeing 787 Dreamliner and larger Boeing 777. However, deliveries of A350s to Qatar Airways have been delayed due to shortages of cabin equipment, Reuters had reported in April. Qatar Airways earlier this year canceled its first delivery of the narrowbody Airbus A320neo jet due to delays because of an engine cooling issue, and has said it must source alternate planes to meet demand.

Flights had to be redirected from Nausori Airport since Sunday because after the sealing works carried out by AFL contractors , the airport was unsuitable for Fiji Airways Boeing 737 aircraft operations. Consumer Council of Fiji chief executive, Premila Kumar, said there should have been ‘better coordination’ between Fiji Airways and Airports Fiji Limited. She said they had received complaints from consumers in the way passengers on international flights from Nausori were managed by the airline and AFL staff members. AFL in responding to the statement said: “We need to understand that flight cancellation due to works at Nausori International Airport was an unforeseen. “AFL brought in a specialist Australian contractor who had worked for a number of nights to seal cracks at Nausori. “Flights would then resume in the day. However, on Sunday, the sealant they applied could not cure in the day resulting in flight cancellations due to precautionary reasons as we cannot compromise on safety. “Since then the contractor Supersealing carried out remedial works and as of Tuesday gave the all clear for runway usage. “Understandably the airlines are carrying out their own independent assessment before resuming B737 flight operations, whilst ATR operations resumed last Monday.” AFL said the reason for the crack sealing works was to give a longer life to the current Nausori runway to service airlines and passengers. This is whilst AFL works on the more permanent runway expansion over the next three years. “These crack sealing works will ensure better serviceability of Nausori over the next two years. The mishap by the contractor is an unforeseen and we are most apologetic to our passengers,” AFL said.   Fiji Airways response Meanwhile, Fiji Airways says they sympathise with their customers affected by the runway closure. “The unsuitability of the runway surface is simply beyond the airline’s control, and we’d refer queries regarding this to Airports Fiji Limited,” it said. “The first cancellation last Sunday was done at the last minute in the interest of safety. Non-availability of buses and restaurants to supply food on Sunday further contribute to delays faced by customers. “Fiji Airways and Fiji Link try to accommodate as many varying needs and requests as possible. “We do understand, however, the inconvenience facing customers in unavoidable situations like these. “Our focus is on getting our customers to their destinations. While it isn’t ideal to transfer customers from Suva to Nadi by road, at times it is the only option available. “Where seats are available on our Twin Otter and ATR aircraft, we are able to fly them to Nadi to catch a connecting international flight.”   Loss of money concerns The Consumer Council indicated they received complaints about some passengers suffering financial loss as they could not take their duty-free purchases already made at Nausori Airport to Nadi. AFL said they have seen the complaints lodged with the council but there are a number of agencies involved in duty free goods clearance. These include Customs, airport security, airlines, duty free operators, specific destination country security regulations, under the overall guidance of the regulator CAAF that are set up based on ICAO safety regulations. “In a one-off unforeseen occurrence, it is difficult to change the safety regulations and systems with multi agencies involved,” AFL said. “We have nevertheless taken the Consumer Councils concerns on board and will work with all agencies. “We invite passengers who have been affected in not being able to take their duty free goods abroad to contact AFL with their specific details. “We will work with the relevant agencies to find solutions. We once again apologise for any inconvenience caused out of this unforeseen.” Feedback:  rachnal@fijisun.com.fj     Tags Airports Fiji LimitedConsumer Council of Fiji chief executiveFiji AirwaysFIJI NEWSPremila KumarPremila KumarConsumer Council of FijiRachna Lal Share Share 0  Tweet 0  +1 0  Share 0  Share 0  Related Articles Scroll Back To Top Island Blu, VaiWai Making A Splash With Natural Artesian Water 0 First National Fisheries Policy In The Pipeline 0 Lawaki Bakery Success, Result Of Women’s Hardwork 0 Paradise Beverages Appoints New Acting GM 0 InterContinental Fiji Wins Fiji’s Best Golf Hotel 2016 0 Garden And Water World Increase Customer Numbers 0 "Everything we did was for our country we knew that we have to prove ourselves to be the best."

What specific opportunities are you pursuing in the regional aircraft leasing segment, following the capital infusion from Bregal Freshstream?  Some 50% of all global air travel is for journeys less than 500 nm. Many airlines that serve this sector not only are the regional divisions of larger airlines, but also dedicated independent regional airlines operating routes away from the traditional hubs. This section of the aircraft leasing market is relatively under-served compared to mainstream aircraft leasing. It requires a specialist approach and a distinctive skills set, as the needs of the market are different in some respects to the mainstream.   Many airlines in this sector operate types such as ATR, Bombardier and Embraer, both jets and turboprops. There is generally less choice for these airlines in terms of leasing options, so we see a great opportunity to provide a service to this market.   Specifically, we are purchasing aircraft in small groups for leaseback, plus individual deals for pairs of aircraft.  We are focused on diversifying our exposure by geography, aircraft type and by airline credit so that we build a broad portfolio.  Do you intend to continue focusing solely on regional aircraft? If so, why? Yes, we intend to focus solely on the needs of regional airlines. This means we must have the skills and experience required in the aircraft types our customers fly.  Generally speaking, the market for Boeing and Airbus leasing is crowded with many offerings. Dedicated, focused experience in ATR and Bombardier turboprops, for example, is less widespread and so our services are in demand.  Our combined management team has more than 100 years of experience in these types of aircraft in good times, and challenging times. We know how to locate, evaluate and support such aircraft and have extensive experience in remarketing and leasing them, which enables us to provide leases optimized for our customers' needs.    What’s included in your aircraft asset portfolio today and how will you build that over the next few years? Right now we already own ATR turboprops and Bombardier regional jets. We aim to close deals in the months ahead to establish a fleet of perhaps 20-25 aircraft over the coming months and perhaps 50 by the end of 2017. We have strong support from our equity backer. They share our vision of providing choice, flexibility and service in this part of the aircraft leasing market. We are committing to the purchase of both used aircraft from other lessors as well as airlines, plus new aircraft on sale and leaseback for delivery in the years ahead.  TrueNoord aspires to be “one of the leading lessors in the regional aircraft market.” How will you do this in the aftermarket and with end of lease transitions? Over the next few years, we plan to build a portfolio of aircraft of reasonable size and diversification. This means that in time, we also will be active in trading aircraft both mid-lease and at the end of lease. We have an enormous amount of experience in remarketing and releasing regional aircraft types--perhaps more experience than may be found in many larger leasing companies. We will be active in helping our clients manage their fleet, in terms of operating leases and remarketing aircraft to make way for changes in the fleet and new deliveries.  How long do you hold your assets? What is your lifecycle management approach? We are building a business for the long term. This means that we are happy to hold a broad range of assets in our portfolio.   This will always include a core of assets on long-term leases with high-quality credit exposure, together with a range of situations where leases may be shorter and the opportunity to trade aircraft will be presented.  Therefore, we will always have aircraft we manage throughout the lifecycle, through new delivery on first leases, through to trading aircraft on to other airlines for their second and third leases, through to eventual part-out.  At the core of our business, however, we are committed to holding high quality, young assets. This will be our main focus. Print Favorite EMAIL Tweet Please Log In or Register to post comments.

He walked quietly and calmly from the arms of his family and friends, into the loving arms of his savior, Jesus Christ. Edward was born February 2, 1970 in Wenatchee, WA to John and LauVonne Melton. Edward was saved and dedicated his life to Jesus in 1977 at the age of seven, and was baptized on Christmas Day. He graduated from Wenatchee High School and immediately joined the Navy. After his discharge from the Navy, he returned home to obtain his two-year Associates Degree from Wenatchee Valley College. From there, he attended Western Washington University and earned his Bachelor’s Degree in Anthropology with a minor in philosophy. He went on to attend University of Washington and while in Seattle, he met Suzanne Elenich. Together, they moved to Maryland, where she became a Certified Equestrian Instructor and he became a Certified Farrier. After completing their schooling, they made their way back to Washington and settled in Federal Way. While Suz continued her equestrian career, Edward found employment in a number of places. He accepted a position in maintenance and soon became the supervisor for an apartment complex. It was during this time he became interested in learning about low voltage electronics. Edward found out he had cancer in 2014. After surgery and treatment, he continued to pursue his interest in low voltage electronics and became an apprentice in that field. He was working as a contracted employee for Boeing when they found out his health would no longer allow him to work in this field. He immediately pursued opportunities to teach creative writing to students in an effort to pursue his certification to teach. Edward was a sponge for learning and meeting people. To his family, he was a wanderer, but to God, he was a teacher of how one should be a friend. While many of us are building walls around ourselves in our lives and careers, Edward was reaching out to his fellow man from Washington State to Maryland, and back again. With kindness, loyalty, generosity and acceptance, he showed all who crossed his path his true self. Edward was an intelligent, curious child who followed his mother around the house relentlessly asking question after question. Once, she closed the door between them for just a moment, and at three years old, he had not finished asking his question, he put his little mouth to the crack in the door and pressed for just one more answer to the important subject on his mind. As an adult, he could carry on a meaningful conversation with anyone who happened to be in his general area, and could talk intelligently on almost any subject. His many friends can attest to his appreciation for individuality, and personal growth. He accepted people no matter where they were in life without judgement or compromise. Edward is in heaven, in the truest sense. We can only imagine his excitement today, as he speaks to those who hold answers to the questions that remained unanswered here on earth. We are sure he is picking the brains of Martin Luther King, Jr., President Lincoln, and a host of others: and we rejoice. We find peace knowing that Edward has finally met his little brother, Joshua; said hi to his Grandma, Lorraine; mama, E.C.; and papa, Pete Melton; hugged his cousin, Jenny Mathews; said hi to auntie Bonnie and auntie Debra. Edward is survived by his soulmate, Suzanne Elenich of Federal Way, WA; parents, John and LauVonne Melton of Wenatchee, WA; aunts and uncles: Orville and Kathy Ochs, Eldon (Eno) and Lori Ochs, Dolonne “Donnie” Beem, Donald and Kelli Melton, Dennis and Shirley Carey, all of Wenatchee, WA; and aunt, Connie Melton of Yakima, WA; papa, Bob Williams of Wenatchee, WA; and many cousins and friends. Edward was preceded in death by his infant brother, Joshua John; grandparents: Lorraine Ochs, Ireneaus “Edward” Ochs, Otis “Pete” Melton, E.C. Melton; aunts: Bonnie Melton, Debra Ochs and Vickie Villa. His Celebration of Life will be held on Friday, September 30, 2016, at 2:00 p.m. at Wenatchee Valley Baptist Church, located at 650 Crawford St., Wenatchee, WA. In Lieu of flowers, donations can be made to Lighthouse Ministries or Wenatchee Valley Baptist Church. Arrangements are by Telford’s Chapel of the Valley, East Wenatchee, WA.

DeHart, 70, is retired from the Boeing Co. This is the second time he has applied to fill a council vacancy. DeHart also made his interest know when Kellen Northcott was appointed to a council vacancy several months ago. DeHart and a second applicant, Riverside Printing co-owner Ben Nelson, were briefly interviewed at last week’s council meeting. Council members then selected DeHart to fill the position. In other business, the council set Oct. 26 as the date for an event to recognize community volunteers for the contributions during the past year. The event will be in the Winthrop Barn. Acheson reminded the council that Confluence Park, the recently completed public space on Riverside Avenue, will be dedicated on Oct. 8 at 11:30 a.m. Jim and Gaye Pigott, owners of Moccasin Lake Ranch, privately financed construction of the park on the former site of the Arrowleaf Bistro. They will donate the park to the Town of Winthrop, which will then take over its maintenance. The Pigotts intend to dedicate the park to Gaye Pigott’s father, Jon Titcomb, who bought Moccasin Lake Ranch in 1961. Council member Mike Strulic noted that the park is already seeing lots of activity. “People are really using it and pleased with it,” he said. “I feel like it was a good decision.” The council also adopted a timeline for considering and adopting the town’s 2017 budget, with the goal of having a public hearing on Nov. 16.

Image: 20th Century Fox Why ‘The Martian’ Author Won’t Join Elon Musk’s Mars Mission Written by Shannon Stirone September 29, 2016 // 08:00 AM EST Copy This URL Earlier this week, SpaceX founder Elon Musk announced his plans for colonizing Mars by the middle of this century, using a humongous new spacecraft design called the Interplanetary Transport System (ITS), which would be capable of carrying a crew of 100 people to the Red Planet at a time. Musk’s sincere belief is that this system can and should ferry up to a million Martian colonists by the 2060s. The plan, which you can read more about in detail here, is incredibly ambitious and plenty outlandish. It’s has already drawn its fair share of critical dissection by those of us in the sci-tech media. But how does it stack up to what we’ve learned about traveling to Mars from sci-fi? To find out, we asked Andy Weir, the author of the bestselling realistic sci-fi novel-turned film The Martian. “The mission profile is definitely achievable, there’s nothing unreasonable in it, but there’s also nothing really innovative about it either,” Weir told Motherboard in a phone conversation. “I’m a huge SpaceX fanboy, I think they are the best commercial spaceflight company out there." Weir also thinks that SpaceX’s cost estimates—$230 million for the booster rocket and a $10 billion total development cost, according to Spaceflight Insider—are optimistic. “A Boeing 777, the workhorse of international travel, costs $320 million,” Weir said. “SpaceX is saying that they can make a long range spacecraft for less than it costs to buy a long range aircraft, I don’t think those numbers add up.” Don’t get Weir wrong though, he loves SpaceX. “I’m a huge SpaceX fanboy, I think they are the best commercial spaceflight company out there," he told me. "They’re innovating and forcing other space industry to actually get off their asses and innovate rather than enjoying their big contracts.” Musk and his SpaceX team have been criticized for years about their lofty plans for reusable rockets and getting to space with people in tow; the new ITS plans will no doubt incite a new level of skepticism. One of the biggest questions raised yesterday was who would want to be crammed into a spacecraft with 99 other strangers for a minimum of three months. Andy Weir testifies before Congress in May 2016. Image: Andy Weir/Facebook Weir’s not too worried about that, though. “People once gathered together in vomit encrusted boats to come to the New World,” Weir said, referring to the Age of Discovery (1500s-1800s) “I did some math on the crew cabin [for the ITS] and it’s actually got a huge internal volume. There’s enough room for everyone to almost have their own dorm room and common spaces.” According to Musk’s presentation, the ITS passenger vehicle would be 49.5 meters (162 feet) in length, and have a diameter of 17 meters (55 feet). Weir makes a good point, as humans have put themselves through some pretty harrowing situations in search of new lands and opportunities. But unlike the first European settlers who came to America —a land rich with soil for farming, lumber, minerals, people, and trade opportunities—Mars is a barren, lifeless, cold deadly place. “There is literally nothing on Mars that’s not in abundance on Earth. So why go?” Weir asked. “The only reason I can imagine people would want to go is because humans have an inherent instinct to spread out, explore, and live in weird places.” During the Q&A portion following Musk’s talk yesterday, when someone asked the space-loving entrepreneur if he planned on going to Mars someday, he seemed a bit hesitant about answering. "I like Earth. I like the internet. I like Diet Coke. I have cats. I write about brave people —I’m not one of them.” You might expect that Andy Weir, who literally wrote the book on traveling to Mars, would be one of the first on board of Musk’s ITS system, but this is not the case. So would he go? “No, not at all,” Weir said. “I do not have that explorer’s instinct. I don’t have ‘the Right Stuff.’ I wouldn’t even go to low Earth orbit. If someone offered me a free trip to the International Space Station, I would decline. I like Earth. I like the internet. I like Diet Coke. I have cats. I write about brave people —I’m not one of them.” Musk’s plans for SpaceX may seem a little mad or brilliant or the stuff of science fiction, but as he pointed out in his talk on Tuesday, SpaceX has delivered on some ambitious goals, goals like landing upright rockets on floating barges and becoming the first private company in history to send cargo to the space station; goals that were previously relegated to science fiction from the 1940s and 50s. (Back then, it was assumed if we ever were a legitimate space faring people than of course we would re-use our rockets!) Transporting humans en masse to other planets like Mars has been present in that art, too. If we are to really go to the Red Planet or worlds beyond, maybe Musk and SpaceX will have proved instrumental in that process. Just don’t expect Andy Weir to be along for the ride.

The Ukrainian authorities are responsible for the crash of flight MH17 in Donbass in July 2014, as they did not ban civil flights over the conflict zone, the head of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic, Alexander Zakharchenko, said on Thursday. Read also Russian aviation official urges Ukraine to bear responsibility for MH17 crash "The responsibility for the shot down Boeing is fully with Ukraine, as well as responsibility for their not preventing the flight. Those responsible will be punished," the Donetsk news agency quoted him as saying. Zakharchenko once again denied any role of Donetsk in the crash of the airliner. The Joint Investigation Team (JIT) that brings together specialists from the Netherlands, Ukraine, Australia, Malaysia and Belgium presented on Wednesday preliminary results of a probe into the crash over Donetsk. The report said the JIT is "convinced of having obtained irrefutable evidence to establish that on 17 July 2014, flight MH-17 was shot down by a BUK missile from the 9M38-series." According to the JIT, there is also evidence that the missile was launched from a farmland near Pervomayskoye to the south of Snezhnoye, which was under control of militias. "So far, the JIT has identified approximately 100 people who can be linked to the downing of MH17 or the transport of the BUK-TELAR," the report said. Read also Kremlin spokesman says report on MH17 crash 'has no proof at all' Russian defense ministry doubts objectivity of MH17 crash investigators' report Investigators of MH17 crash fail to match real damage — missile manufacturer Moscow considers MH17 probe biased, politically motivated — foreign ministry MH17 crash investigators call not to rush with accusations against Russia Kremlin calls for impartial, full investigation of MH17 crash in Ukraine The Dutch-led team has not so far identified any particular suspect, Dutch prosecutor Fred Westerbeke who heads the JIT said, adding that it was early to speak about their nationality or any Russia’s involvement. The team had no time to look into data presented by Russia, which disproves this version. On July 17, 2014, a Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777 passenger airliner on flight MH17 from the Dutch city of Amsterdam to the Malaysian capital of Kuala Lumpur crashed in the Donetsk region in eastern Ukraine, killing all 298 people on board. Most passengers - 193 people - were Dutch nationals. The strike of a ground-to-air or air-to-air missile was named as a possible cause of the crash. Ukraine’s authorities and the militia of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic accused each other of the tragedy. On July 21, the UN Security Council called to carry out an independent investigation. Russia’s representatives have said on many occasions they are dissatisfied with how the investigation was carried out and that the data presented by the Russian side were ignored. {{item.group_date}} {{item.suffix?", "+item.suffix:""}} Show more Share Topics Boeing 777 crash in Ukraine Top News November 18, 15:20 Putin says Russia seeks to maintain world’s strategic balance of power November 18, 15:20 November 18, 15:44 Russian premier: Russia regains status of leading player on world’s food market November 18, 15:44 November 18, 16:04 Deputy PM says agriculture is engine of Russian economic growth November 18, 16:04 November 18, 15:53 PM Medvedev’s coffee joke may add ‘Russiano’ to country’s beverage menu November 18, 15:53 In other media Реклама Photo 11 Meet the future First Lady of the United States Melania Trump 13 Donald Trump's path to presidency 4 Triumphant Trump supporters flock to White House to celebrate Infographics Russia's gas pipelines to Europe by 2018 The US and Ukraine voted against the UN resolution condemning the glorification of Nazism Opium production in Afghanistan over 20 years The Eurasian Economic Union starts its work Most read Now Today This week 1 Clarivate Analytics Names 2016 Highly Cited Researchers 2 Russian Army to receive missiles with warheads based on new physical principles 3 Russian expert on accuracy of Kh-101 cruise missiles used against terrorists in Syria 4 Russian Defense Ministry says ‘Aleppo bombings blunder’ will leave stain on Kirby’s bio 5 Ukraine is considering extradition of Saakashvili to Georgia — media 6 Russia's Tupolev-95MSM bomber delivers first-ever strike on mission to Syria 7 Russia’s first pro-Trump rally to be held in Kaluga region 1 Russia's Tupolev-95MSM bomber delivers first-ever strike on mission to Syria 2 Russia's 'Night Hunter': from maiden flight to fighting ISIS 3 Russian bombers deliver strike at terrorist strongholds in Syria — Defense Ministry 4 Obama calls Russia ‘military superpower,’ important partner 5 Family of Russian officer killed in Syria writes letter to Hollande 6 Russian Army to receive missiles with warheads based on new physical principles 7 Russian diplomat says Lavrov, Kerry to discuss US ‘shocking’ treatment of RT television 1 Russian forces launch large-scale operation against terrorists in Syria 2 MIG-29 fighter jet crashes into Mediterranean off Syrian coast 3 Russia's Tupolev-95MSM bomber delivers first-ever strike on mission to Syria 4 Russia declines to ratify International Criminal Court Statute 5 Obama calls Russia ‘military superpower,’ important partner 6 Russian bombers deliver strike at terrorist strongholds in Syria — Defense Ministry 7 Putin sets task to ensure reliable protection of Russian forces in Syria TOP STORIES US presidential election 2016 Conflict in Syria Russia's defense industry Oil & Gas Industry Space programs Реклама News World Russian Politics & Diplomacy Business & Economy Military & Defense Science & Space Society & Culture Sport Press Review Sections Tags Media Press Releases Infographics About us TASS TODAY AGENCY NEWS TASS HISTORY MANAGEMENT CONTACTS Services TASS-PHOTO TASS-ONLINE TASS Beta-version.

According to Carlisle, the IOC has been approved for 15 QF-16s currently available for target operations. Airmen from the 82nd Aerial Target Squadron (ATRS) under the 53rd Wing will fly the aircraft assigned to Tyndall Air Force Base in Florida. The new aerial target will replace the QF-4 aerial target that is to officially retire in December this year. 82nd ATRS commander lieutenant colonel Matthew Garrison said: "This leap forward in airframe capabilities, combined with advanced electronic pods, will allow us to properly test and evaluate our fifth-generation aircraft and weapons.” The Boeing-built QF-16 FSAT has been designed to provide next-generation of combat training and testing for US warfighters. Retired F-16 aircraft are converted into QF-16 aerial targets for use in testing newly developed weapons and tactics, said Boeing. "The Boeing-built QF-16 FSAT has been designed to provide next-generation of combat training and testing for US warfighters." The QF-16 maintains all inherent capabilities of the baseline F-16 Fighting Falcon including supersonic flight and 9 G manoeuvrability, according to the airforce. Boeing and the USAF conducted the first unmanned flight of the QF-16 in 2013 at Tyndall Air Force Base. The QF-16 mission profile included auto takeoff, a series of simulated manoeuvres, supersonic flight and an auto land, all without a pilot in the cockpit. Testing on the six aircraft continues at Holloman Air Force Base. Image: A QF-16 flies across the horizon at Tyndall Air Force Base. Photo: courtesy of US Air Force photo/Sara Vidoni.

Investigators: Missile That Downed MH17 Was Brought in from Russia VOA News Facebook 0 Twitter 0 E-mail More Google+ LinkedIn KakaoStory September 29, 2016 08:08 International investigators say a Malaysian airliner that crashed over eastern Ukraine in July 2014 was shot down by a surface-to-air missile that was transported into the country from Russia. The findings released Wednesday confirm an earlier investigation by the Dutch Safety Board that concluded Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17 was brought down by a Russian-made Buk missile, a claim Russia has denied. "It may be concluded MH17 was shot down by a 9M38 missile launched by a Buk, brought in from the territory of the Russian Federation," said Wilbert Paulissen of the Dutch National Police. Paulissen said evidence shows that pro-Russian rebels requested the deployment of the surface-to-air missile to the village of Pervomaysk and reported its arrival in eastern Ukraine. But Russia has dismissed the Dutch-led investigation as subjective. "Russia is disappointed that the situation around the investigation of the Boeing crash is not changing," Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said in a statement. "The conclusions of the Dutch Prosecutor's office confirmed that the investigation is biased and politically motivated." Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Major General Igor Konashenkov told the Interfax news agency, "All of the data presented today at the briefing by the investigation team has two main sources: the Internet and security services of Ukraine. Therefore, doubts are bound to be raised over the objectivity of this information, and, correspondingly, the conclusions based on it." Zakharova said Russia offered to assist in the investigation but the investigators "removed Moscow from full participation," relegating Russia to only a "minor role." In a move aimed at preempting the new findings, Russian spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters earlier Wednesday that Russian radar data proved that no rocket was fired from within territory held by pro-Russian separatists in Ukraine. "The most important thing in today's report is that the circle is narrowing and perhaps next year the international commission of inquiry will name the perpetrators of the crime," Bogdan Petrenko, deputy director of the Ukrainian Institute of Extremism, told VOA. "Probably, after a final conclusion, it will be possible to take the Russian Federation to court. Of course, we are talking first and foremost about the relatives of the victims of the downed Boeing." "The investigation, a trial in this case, is very important for Ukraine. It makes it possible to sue Russia according to several international conventions," political analyst Olesya Yakhno-Belkovskaya told VOA. "One involves support and financing of terrorism. The results of the investigation of this tragedy are, in particular, proof of Russia's actions in the east of the country -- support and funding of military operations against Ukraine." The U.S. Department of State said the findings support Secretary of State John Kerry's statement days after the attack that the plane was downed by a BUK missile that was launched from an area controlled by Russian-backed rebels. "While nothing can take away the grief of those who lost loved ones on that tragic day, this announcement is another step toward bringing to justice those responsible for this outrageous attack," said State Department spokesman John Kirby. Ukrainian forces and Russian-backed rebels were engaged in intense fighting in eastern Ukraine at the time of the crash. Wilbert Paulissen of the Joint Investigation Team speaks on the preliminary results of the investigation into the shooting-down of Malaysia Airlines jetliner flight MH17 during a press conference in Nieuwegein, Netherlands on Sept. 28, 2016. /AP ◆ Ukraine Reacts to Findings Ukraine's Foreign Ministry hailed the report as "an important milestone" that exposes Russia's "direct involvement" in the missile attack. "This puts an end to all of Russia’s attempts to discredit activities of the Joint Investigation Team and conclusions by spreading distorted or fabricated information," the ministry said. Malaysia called Wednesday for the perpetrators of the missile attack to be brought to justice. "Malaysia wants firm action to be taken," said Prime Minister Najib Razak. "We have promised that those who were responsible for the downing of the aircraft will be brought to justice." In addition to Russia's consistent denial of any involvement in the crash, Moscow has claimed the airliner was downed either by a Ukrainian fighter jet or shot down from Ukrainian-held territory. But the evidence against that is overwhelming, military science analyst Justin Bronk of the London-based Royal United Services Institute said in an interview with VOA. "The rebels had been firing surface-to-air missiles regularly for months at all sorts of Ukrainian military aircraft. They did not have any official contact with air traffic control. So they basically have just taken delivery of a much more powerful missile system than they had had previously, and were shooting at whatever they could see. And they, unfortunately, happened to hit an airliner." Netherlands chief prosecutor Fred Westerbeke said investigators have identified about 100 who were involved in the attack "one way or another." He said, "A clear impression of the chain of command" must be established before it can be determined if they are culpable. The report, which stopped short of concluding Russian soldiers were involved, was prepared by prosecutors from Australia, Belgium, Malaysia, the Netherlands and Ukraine. The report's findings were based on thousands of pieces of evidence, including wiretaps, photographs, witness statements and forensics tests that were gathered over a more than two year period. ◆ Possible Criminal Trial Investigators say the latest findings, in addition to those from an earlier investigation, may be solid enough to be used in a criminal trial. Prosecutors cannot file charges at this time because international investigators have not agreed in which court to hold a trial. The previous investigation identified a 320-square kilometer area where it said the rocket launch must have taken place. Authorities did not explicitly say who had fired it, although all the land was controlled by pro-Russian separatists fighting Ukrainian forces. In a move aimed at preempting the new findings, Russia on Wednesday said its radar data proved that no rocket was fired from within territory held by pro-Russian separatists in Ukraine. On a conference call with reporters, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russian radar identified all flying objects over the rebel territory, and there was no rocket. "The data are clear-cut...there is no rocket," he said. "If there was a rocket, it could only have been fired from elsewhere." All 298 passengers on the Boeing 777 died after it broke apart in mid-air while traveling from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. The downing of the plane was a major factor in a decision by the European Union and the United States to impose sanctions on Russia, leading to a rise in East-West tensions to levels not seen since the end of the Cold War in 1991.

Kiev and independence supporters in Ukraine’s southeast have blamed each other for the downing of the MH17 plane. According to the JIT, the flight was downed by a 9М38 missile launched from Buk, which was brought from Russia and later returned there, near with the Pervomayskoe settlement, which was controlled by Donbas militias. At the same time the investigators failed to prove that the system had been brought from the Russian territory. Russia’s Almaz-Antey, which was Buk manufacturer, said that it's tests revealed that the missile had been launched from Zaroshchenskoe settlement. Director of the National Criminal Investigation Division of National Police of the Netherlands Wilbert Paulissen said that at the moment of the downing, militias had resisted Ukrainian Air Force's airstrikes. At the same time, JIT chief and Dutch prosecutor Fred Westerbeke declined to formally link the crash to Russia or Russian nationals. According to Westerbeke, the investigators have identified 100 people "in one way or another" involved in the downing, but added that they should identify people, who were in the Buk's cabin and to find out whether they acted on their own or received orders. The investigators also reported that they would continue the probe into the flight crash until early 2018. THOUSANDS OF EVIDENCES Westerbeke told reporters that the results of the investigation were based on the investigation of some 1,450 debris of the plane that had been collected within the framework of the probe, as well as on the evidences collected in Internet. He added that up to 200 investigators worked on the issue during the investigation and some 100 investigators, prosecutors and experts were still involved in the inquiry. © AFP 2016/ EMMANUEL DUNAND EU Supports JIT's Investigation Into MH17 Crash, Welcomes Inquiry's ProgressHe added that the investigators had studied about half a million of video records and photographs and listened about 3,500 intercepted phone conversations, which had been provided by Ukraine's security services by court order. According to the investigators, the abovementioned materials contributed to clarification of the Buk's route. During the report's presentation, the JIT showed reporters video records and photographs showing the details of Buk's movement and a phone conversation of people, who discussed the details of the Buk's delivery. The presentation had also included photos of an alleged launch site and a condensation trail. INFORMATION FROM RUSSIA Despite the fact that Russia is not a member of the JIT, the information from Moscow had also been attached to the case. The Russian Defense Ministry said this week it would forward the new data uncovered by one of the Almaz-Antey's radar and control system production plants to Dutch investigators. Commenting on this fact, Westerbeke told reporters that the investigators had not received such information yet, but would thoroughly study it in future. At the same time the Dutch prosecutors were still expecting Russia's response to several requests on the issue. Earlier in the day, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that the MH17 crash probe was accompanied by speculation and other countries' refusal to provide radar data, adding that it was necessary to make conclusions against the backdrop of all the available information, including the most recent data. MOSCOW'S RESPONSE The report and its conclusions could not have slipped under the radar in Moscow. Almaz-Antey rejected the findings in the probe, saying that the investigators had not got enough technical evidence to support their claims. "The conclusions by the Joint Investigation Team announced today do not have sufficient technical evidence to support claims allegations that Russia was somehow involved in Malaysian Boeing catastrophe in summer of 2014," Mikhail Malyshevsky, an adviser to Almaz-Antey general director, told RIA Novosti. According to Malyshevsky, Almaz-Antey has conducted three simulations that can serve as technical proof of the fact that a missile, which downed the Malaysian plane, was launched from the Zaroshchenskoe area, controlled by units of the Ukrainian army at the time of the incident. He added that the investigators made their conclusions in accordance with the characteristics of a US missile that was different from the ones used in Buk systems. Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov said that the impartiality of the data provided by the investigators of the crash and the conclusions made on the basis of this data cannot help but cause doubts. "We familiarized ourselves carefully with today’s statements of the representatives of the Dutch investigation team on proving the crash of the Malaysian Boeing MH17 in the Ukrainian airspace… I remind that all data presented today in the briefing of the investigation team had two main sources – the internet and the Ukrainian special services. Therefore, the impartiality of this data and consequently the conclusions made on its basis cannot help but cause doubts," Konashenkov said. The official added that no Russian missile systems, including Buk, have ever crossed the Russian-Ukrainian border. The Russian Foreign Ministry said that Russia was disappointed with the situation around the investigation of the airliner's crash. "Russia is disappointed that the situation regarding the Boeing crash is not changing. The conclusion of the Dutch prosecutors confirm that the case is biased and politically motivated," Maria Zakharova, the spokeswoman for the ministry, said in a statement. According to the spokeswoman, Ukraine was made a member of the JIT despite the fact that it is an interested side. "It sounds like a cruel joke, but Ukraine was made a full-fledged member of the JIT, giving it an opportunity to falsify evidence and have the case develop to its advantage… Everything that the so-called ‘evidence base’ of the Dutch prosecution is based on was provided by the Ukrainian agencies, which are indubitably an interested side," Zakharova said. She also expressed hope that the situation would change after Russia provided "such indisputable evidence as primary radar data." WORLD'S REACTION © Sputnik/ Maksim Blinov UK Foreign Minister Calls on Russia to Engage Constructively in MH17 ProbeThe 2014 tragedy claimed lives of almost 300 people, who were the citizens of many countries, such as Netherlands, Malaysia, Australia, Belgium and Indonesia among others. This has contributed to the fact that representatives of different countries have commented the Wednesday report. Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak promised to convene a meeting with representatives of Ukraine, Netherlands and Australia to discuss the report adding that the responsible for the crash should be brought to justice. Belgian Foreign Minister Didier Reynders welcomed the publication of the results of the investigation. Ukraine’s Foreign Ministry said in a statement that the JIT's conclusions are a significant step towards the punishment of the culprits of the crash. "The publication of this information is an important milestone towards our ultimate common goal: bringing to justice all those responsible for downing the aircraft. It is our moral duty to the 298 victims and their relatives and friends," the ministerial statement said. The deputy defense minister of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic's (DPR), Eduard Basurin, said that the JIT was wrong in its conclusions about the alleged launch of the missile from militias-controlled territory in eastern Ukraine. "I believe that it [investigation] is brought to a deadlock on purpose. For the second time the team makes its conclusions, for the second time the conclusions are wrong," Basurin told journalists adding that neither the United State nor Ukraine provided radar or satellite data used as a basis for accusations against Donbas militias. ...

International Business Times, India Edition International Business Times, India Edition India World Business Technology Sports Entertainment Auto Health Photos Video Search Search Flight MH17 was shot down by Russia-made missle say prosecutors September 28, 2016 22:13 IST By Reuters Close Embed <iframe src="http://www.ibtimes.co.in/tv/embed/41428" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe> Pro-Russian rebels in Ukraine have rejected claims they were behind the downing of Malaysia Airline flight MH17 in July 2014. On 28 September, the Joint Investigation Team (JIT) looking into the incident claimed the Buk missile, which hit the plane in eastern Ukraine, was from Russia. The plane crashed in the pro-Russia rebel-held city of Donetsk. All 298 people on board of the 777 Boeing flying from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur died. Local rebels rejected the probe findings, according to news agency AFP. Russia already denied its involvement in the incident, claiming the findings were extremely political. Based on the criminal investigation, we have concluded that flight MH17 was downed by a Buk missile of the series 9M83 that came from the territory of the Russian Federation, Dutch chief investigator Wilbert Paulissen said in a news conference on 28 September. He added the missile launcher was later taken back to Russia. The report came months after investigators found a part of the Buk missile at the Ukraine crash site. A 2015 preliminary report by the Dutch Safety Board (DSB) into the crash had already ruled out technical faults or actions by the crew. It said the plane broke up in the air due to a large number of high-energy objects that penetrated it from the outside. Families of victims have asked Russian President Vladimir Putin £1bn in compensation for his failure to support the investigation.

He said they couldn't say more than that a Buk missile system, which downed Boeing, came from Russia and returned there. Westerbeke said they cannot say or make any statements about the participation of the Russian Federation as a country or Russians in this tragedy.

Facts 2016-09-28T17:52+02:00 17:52 28.09.2016 Report on MH17 crash points to Russia's guilt The Ukrainian Foreign Ministry said that the report by the Joint Investigation Team (JIT), unveiling the results of an inquiry into the causes of the crash of a Malaysian Boeing in Donbas in July 2014, points at Russia's direct involvement in the downing of the plane. "A new and extremely important element in today's report is the information on the route by which the weapon traveled from Russia to Ukraine and was taken back via part of the Ukrainian-Russian border, which was controlled only by Russians and their militants. This once again points to the aggressor state having been directly involved in the shooting down of the plane," the ministry said in a statement on the results of the investigation of the Joint Investigation Team into the downing of the MH17 plane in the skies over Donbas. "In the course of the criminal investigation, all other possible theories and causes of this horrible tragedy were examined and dismissed. This put an end to all Russian attempts to discredit the efforts by the Joint Investigation Team and the results of the inquiry through the dissemination of distorted or fabricated information," the ministry said. According to the report released by the JIT earlier on Wednesday, the Boeing was downed by a Buk surface-to-air rocket that had been brought to eastern Ukraine from Russia, and the attack itself was launched from an area in Donetsk region controlled by militants.

Malaysian Airlines plane was conducting a regular flight from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur. Communication with the Boeing was lost at 4 PM. At that time it was above separatist-occupied part of Donetsk region.The Russian proxies were happy - they thought the Ukrainian army plane was downed. Then-so-called defence minister of self-proclaimed Donetsk republic wrote about the crash on Facebook. He quickly removed the post when he realized: the crashed plane was an international civilian flight. 283 passengers and 15 crew members died. Russian media were the first to come to the scene of the disaster - and the war for truth began. Read more Russia blames Ukraine for falsifying evidence in MH17 case The militants immediately started to prowl like rabid hyinas around the crash area. They gathered the black boxes, liner wreckage and even personal belongings of passengers. Neither OSCE monitoring mission nor international experts were allowed at the scene during the first days. The first Ukrainian argument on who actually downed the MH17 was the intercepted conversation between terrorists. After the initial analysis of their own data, General Staff of Ukraine stated - the Malaysian Airlines plane was shot down with a missile from Buk complex, delivered from Russia. A day before the catastrophe this convoy drove through several towns and was filmed by the citizens. Read more MH17 investigation report: full version (with video) From the day of the tragedy and until now, Russia, who possessed the main evidence, taken by militants, said - Ukraine is responsible for the catastrophe. The first scenario included a Ukrainian jet, last week - the jet disappeared and Moscow turned to a new version. Only this time it was a Ukrainian one. Downing of the plane became a turning point in relations between Russia and the civilized world. Citizens of 18 countries were aboard that fatal plane. Each and every one of their relatives and friends  - not only demanded truth but also started their own investigations. All that Kremlin could do - was to hold the evidence and produce spurious theories. For example, the Buk downing was a 'Putin's assassination' attempt, or 'a special op inside the liner', or even the craziest version: the passengers and crew were already dead and they were placed in the plane on purpose. Read more Russian Defence Ministry presents new data proving the previous ones were a fake Nevertheless, most experts who conducted independent investigations said that the MH17 was shot by a Buk missile. BellingCat investigators - proved that Russia provided false satellite images to blame Ukraine. But the US experts, using their satellites, restored that day - minute by minute. Today's first official report of the international commission says that a missile was launched from the separatist-controlled territory of Ukraine, from Russian Buk with a crew, trained - again - in Russia. Ukrainian Buk complexes were too far away from the plane. The next step in this sad story - is organizing an international court, which Russia also opposes.

The Dutch inquiry found that a Russian-made missile hit the plane. It, the report stated, was launched from a Ukrainian village held by pro-Russian rebels. Russia issued a statement saying it is “disappointed by the fact that the situation with the Boeing crash investigation hasn’t changed,” and adding that “the conclusions of the Dutch prosecutor’s office confirm that the inquiry was biased and politically-motivated.” Almaz-Antey, the Russian state-owned anti-aircraft missile manufacturer which made the BUK used to shoot down the plane, said the findings presented by the Dutch team were based on a simulation of the crash, not reality. “During today’s presentation real technical evidence was almost absent,” claimed Mikhail Malyshevsky, an adviser to the company’s Director General. “Certain questions were not touched upon, and we at Almaz Antey believe this isn’t right.” Both Ukraine and Russia operate BUK systems and have accused one another of being guilty of causing the crash. This week, the foreign ministry released radar data purporting to show that no missile was fired at the plane from rebel-controlled territory in eastern Ukraine. The Russian Foreign Ministry issued the following allegation: “To arbitrarily designate a guilty party and dream up the desired results has become the norm for our Western colleagues,” spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said. “The investigation to this day continues to ignore incontestable evidence from the Russian side, despite the fact that Russia is practically the only one sending reliable information to them.” Dutch investigators say they have not yet seen the newly-released data. However, they added that the evidence is strong and their conclusion is unlikely to change.

The Partners in Flight outreach programme, sponsored by Boeing, has been brought to Bury St Edmunds by Bury in Bloom in partnership with Suffolk County Council and Bury St Edmunds Town Council to celebrate the new B-17 sculpture on Mount Road. During the interactive sessions, run by a team from the Imperial War Museum, Duxford, participants build a scale model B-29 Superfortress, explore the history and engineering behind the craft as well as participate in a series of mini-experiments which investigate the principles of flight. The B-29 was one of America’s most iconic and revolutionary aircrafts of the Second World War and was so technologically advanced, it remained in service for many years afterwards. Workshops have so far been held at Moreton Hall Community Centre for Abbots Green Primary School and Serbert Wood Primary School today (Friday, September 23), with two remaining sessions arranged at the same location for the general public on tomorrow (Saturday, September 24), between 10.15am to 11.45am, and 1.30pm to 3pm. There is no need to book. The workshops have been made possible with a locality grant from Suffolk County Councillor, Trevor Beckwith, Sign in {* #userInformationForm *} Sign in socially {* loginWidget *} with your email address {* traditionalSignIn_emailAddress *} {* traditionalSignIn_password *} {* traditionalSignIn_signInButton *} Forgot your password?

International prosecutors investigating the downing of flight MH17 over eastern Ukraine in 2014 say the Buk missile that hit the plane was from Russia. They also narrowed down the area it was fired from to a field in territory controlled by Russian-backed rebels. All 298 people on board the Boeing 777 died when it broke apart in mid-air flying from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur. Russia says the conclusions are “extremely political” and its Buk missiles “never shot down” the plane. “Based on the criminal investigation, we have concluded that flight MH17 was downed by a Buk missile of the series 9M83 that came from the territory of the Russian Federation,” chief Dutch police investigator Wilbert Paulissen said in a news conference on Thursday. The missile launcher was later taken back to Russia, he said. The Joint Investigation Team showed a number of videos and audio recordings that they say proves the missile came from Russia. An inquiry by the Dutch Safety Board last year found that a Russian-made Buk missile hit the plane but did not say where it was fired from. But Russia has rejected the conclusions, calling them “extremely political”. “This is of course a provocative statement… it has nothing to do with investigating the tragedy that took away the lives of so many people,” said Leonid Slutsky, the head of the parliamentary committee for the CIS (Commonwealth of Independent State). “These conclusions seek to achieve only one objective – to further marginalise the image of Russia in the global political and information space,” he added. Who gave the order? Prosecutors have narrowed the missile launch site down to a specific field near the village of Pervomaiskyi, which was then in rebel hands. They established the identities of about 100 people “linked to the crash or the transport of the Buk” missile, but they are yet to determine who could be held criminally responsible. There is a need to establish who gave the order to move the missile launcher into eastern Ukraine, and where the order for it to be fired came from, investigators said. The Dutch-led Joint Investigation Team (JIT) consists of prosecutors from the Netherlands, Australia, Belgium, Malaysia and Ukraine. Many witnesses Prosecutors played recordings from intercepted phone calls during their news conference. They said witnesses reported seeing the missile launcher move from Russia into Ukraine and presented pictures and videos. The launch site was pinpointed by “many witnesses”, prosecutors said. Russia’s changing story In the two years since MH17 was shot down, Russian officials have presented several theories about what happened. Relatives were briefed before the JIT released their preliminary findings. “They told us how the Buk was transported [and] how they came to that evidence from phone taps, photo, film material, video,” Robby Oehler, whose niece was killed in the crash, told the BBC. Separatist rebels have denied they were involved. “We never had such air defence systems, nor the people who could operate them,” Eduard Basurin, military deputy operational commander at the rebel Donetsk People’s Republic, told the Interfax news agency. “Therefore we could not have shot down the Boeing [flight MH17].” Earlier this week, Russia said it had radar data showing that the missile was not fired from rebel-held territory. The JIT does not yet have access to that data, prosecutors said. – By: BBC Ebenezer Afanyi-Dadzie More on citifmonline.com Indians offer kidneys to ailing minister November 18, 2016 Mozambique fuel tanker blast kills dozens November 18, 2016 Japan PM has ‘great confidence’ in Trump November 18, 2016 Protesters storm Brazil Congress seeking military rule November 17, 2016 I wanted to curl up – Clinton November 17, 2016 Mystery over Dutch WW2 shipwrecks vanished from Java Sea bed November 16, 2016 General News Gov’t’s ‘restored allowance’ confusing – Trainee nurses November 18, 2016 Chief of Staff leads gov’t delegation to console Otumfuo [Photos] November 18, 2016 Man douses girlfriend in acid November 18, 2016 Court strikes out Martin Amidu’s ‘false claim’ against Mahama November 18, 2016 Retain NDC to move Ghana forward – Mahama November 18, 2016 Advertisement Recent Posts Gov’t’s ‘restored allowance’ confusing – Trainee nurses Vote for positive change – Greenstreet urges Ghanaians Chief of Staff leads gov’t delegation to console Otumfuo [Photos] Child marriage increases by 42% in Northern Ghana Man douses girlfriend in acid Court strikes out Martin Amidu’s ‘false claim’ against Mahama Indians offer kidneys to ailing minister Veep assures of massive jobs in health sector Retain NDC to move Ghana forward – Mahama Volkswagen to cut 30,000 jobs in huge post-dieselgate revamp Find us on Facebook © Copyright 2016 | citifmonline.com | All Rights Reserved.

ADVERTISING INQUIRIES HERITAGE TRAVEL DIRECTORY PRIVACY POLICY Close Why was the Inchon Landing a Success? facebook twitter linkedin pinterest print By Mr. History 9/27/2016 • Ask Mr. History What are the reasons behind the success of the Inchon Landing despite the dissatisfaction within the UN troops and surprise & deception measures adopted by both the warring parties? Maj Bishwonath Timilsina Army War College Nepal Army   ???   Dear Major Timilsina, The success of General Douglas MacArthur’s landing at Inchon was fundamentally due to the overwhelming advantage United Nations forces held at sea and in the air, but as far as intelligence goes there were added reasons for it going as successfully as it did. When it came to deception, the North Korean People’s Army, buoyed by its earlier success at maintaining the initiative, was largely guilty of self-deception, committing itself primarily to one last five-pronged offensive designed to break through the Pusan Perimeter. This started on September 1, but thanks to Lt. Gen. Walton Walker’s brilliance at parrying each enemy thrust, had been stalemated at all points by September 15. Meanwhile, on September 5, Boeing B-29s of the U.S. Air Force had begun mass bombing roads and railroads around Kunsan, 113 miles south of Inchon, as if to isolate it in preparation for a landing—and on the following day UN naval forces began staging close to Kunsan. Further activity climaxed on the night of September 12-13, when U.S. special operations troops and Royal Marines, landed from the British frigate Whitesand Bay, landed at the Kunsan docks. While this was going on, Central Intelligence Agency members were infiltrating Inchon, gathering intelligence and stationing themselves to transmit it to the landing force. As a result of all these factors the North Koreans were inadequately prepared when UN forces bombarded the real landing zone on September 10 (including their minelaying, which did not present much problem for the naval forces) and when they landed on September 15, on top of which the commander on Wolmido island assured his superiors that his garrison could deal with the UN landings there (it didn’t). The overall upshot was an overwhelming victory that secured the area by September 19. Moreover, besides leading to the liberation of Seoul the presence of so many UN troops behind it just as UN forces around Pusan were taking the offensive caused a general rout in the NKPA. Only Chinese intervention late in October prevented complete collapse in North Korea.

World 10:55, 26 September 2016 REUTERS The Buk was transferred from Russia to the militant-controlled territory of Donbas and operated by the crew from Russia's 53rd Air Defense Missile Brigade. The experts also revealed almost the exact launch site – a large field near the town of Snizhne of Donetsk region. However, according to Bellingcat's coordinator Aric Toler, official investigators from the Joint Investigation Team (JIT) will be able to present more accurate data, Radio Liberty reports. Toler says that there may be new information, in particular, on the exact spot of the missile launch. The investigators could probe the soil and establish, in which part of the field the Buk was located. Read alsoJIT to present interim results of MH17 downing probe late SeptemberThey cannot blame Russia for the tragedy, but after the exact launch location and is identified in the area under the Russian-backed militants' control, any speculations of Ukraine's involvement in the tragedy will be removed. Bellingcat continues its own research, but the report has not been prepared yet, Toler said. According to the expert from Bellingcat, Russia is now pushing new bits of data coming from Almaz-Antey in order to "disrupt" the report of the Joint Investigation Team. The Russian side has kept the radar data for more than two years, and now they must explain why it was submitted so late. Read alsoMore MH17 docs released, Dutch govt. assumed Russian separatist to be responsibleAccording to Toler, Russia is releasing this information now in order to declare later that the JIT has not taken it into account. Most likely, radar images will be true and full, but the Buk missile won't be seen on them because of technical limitations. This opinion is shared by Ukrainian volunteer researchers from InformNapalm. Anton Pavlushko, the co-author of studies on the downed Boeing, recalled that two years ago, the Russian side had stated that they had no data, but now these data suddenly appeared. He also reminded that Russia still did not explain the lack of data on military radar station in Millerovo, where, according to the investigation by InformNapalm, the Buk missile system was located for some time.

ABC News Australia reports that travelers should check their trip status if they plan to fly in or out of the travel hub. Most travelers know storms, tornados, and other inclement weather can cause problems for air travel, but many probably haven't considered the disruption an active volcano can have on flight schedules. In Iceland, the volcanic landscape has wreaked havoc on travel in the past: The eruption of Eyjafjallajkull in 2010 caused closures of airspace over Europe and delayed thousands of flights. Active volcanoes can throw ash miles into the air, and though volcanic ash may seem relatively harmless from the ground, when aircrafts collide with it at hundreds of miles per hour it's an entirely different story. Severely Decreased Visibility Ash is heavy enough to make it incredibly hard to see out of a cockpit window. This is an expected condition of flying near an active volcano, but pilots are trained to fly in situations with little to no visibility with help from radars. Even so, flying into a giant column of ash is not something pilots do on purpose. Engine Clogging Consider this the second-worst thing that can happen when you're flying through ash. According to Boeing, if caught at the right (that is, wrong) time, the ash can pile up in the engines and cause equipment failures. Boeing has documented a number of these situations. Ash Can Melt Into Glass Popular Science has broken down the nightmarish thing that occurs when you put volcanic ash in a hot situation: When ash is introduced to extremely high temperaturesmuch like the environment of an airplane engineit melts into glass. When this happens to an airplane engine, the inside of the pylon (the part that holds the engine on the wing) can become encased in glass. After this happens, the cabin can fill with a sulfuric-smelling smoke. Travel Pulse recently shared the story of a British Airways plane stuck flying through a column of volcanic ash over Indonesia. That specific flight has since gone down in history for the longest glide by a non-purpose-built aircraft. How did they even manage that?

The board of Ryanair has voted to sell its shares in Irish rival Aer Lingus to IAG, Friday July 10, 2015, putting the British Airways parent solidly on course to acquire the former Irish national airline. (AP Photo/Shawn Pogatchnik, FILE) WINDSOR LOCKS, Conn. (WWLP) – Starting Wednesday, you will be able to fly directly from Bradley International Airport to Dublin, Ireland. Irish carrier Aer Lingus has been planning the daily direct flights since they made the announcement last year. Aer Lingus Boeing 757s will carry 12 business class and 165 economy class passengers to Ireland, along with some cargo, in six to seven-hour flights. If you are traveling to Ireland, however, you must take into account the time difference; they are five hours ahead of us. Passengers whose ultimate destination isn’t the Emerald Isle may connect from Dublin to about 28 other European cities. Wednesday’s first flight will be a big milestone for Bradley, which hasn’t hosted transatlantic flights since 2009, when service to Amsterdam was discontinued. The pricing for tickets from Bradley to Dublin is similar to flights leaving from Boston or New York; with booking a last-second ticket costing about $1,400. There are some benefits to flying out of Bradley, however. You will only have to go through customs in Dublin. Once you get off your return flight at Bradley, you can go home without waiting in line. The service to Ireland will also have economic benefits for western Massachusetts; bringing international travelers closer to our area. “The opportunities that we have here for jobs are increasing, so those connections to other countries are going to be ever increasing and more important as we build those connections for business,” said Rick Sullivan, President of the Western Massachusetts Economic Development Council. Currently, the only international flights operating out of Bradley travel to Canada, Mexico, and the Caribbean. News 8’s sister station reporter David McKay will be on Wednesday’s first flight to Ireland. Over the next several days, he will have a look at who is going to be using these flights, and where they will be going once they are in Ireland.

Sections Deseret NewsOpinion Opinion Derek B. Miller: Utah lost Facebook but can still save face By Derek B. MillerFor the Deseret News Published: Sept. 28, 2016 12:10 a.m. Updated: Sept. 27, 2016 7:23 p.m. 5 Comments In case you missed it amidst the status updates, news feed, likes, photos and pokes, Facebook has made its long-awaited decision. The company that created modern social networking and connected the world in ways heretofore unknown will build its massive data center in New Mexico, not Utah. The project had the potential to bring up to $1.5 billion in capital investment to Utah and would have joined a long list of notable companies that have moved to the Beehive State, including Proctor & Gamble, Adobe, Goldman Sachs, eBay, Boeing and many more. In the corporate recruitment world where success begets success and reputation matters, this loss has consequences. In the long run, there are lessons to be learned that if ignored will produce an even greater loss. The first lesson is it’s better to risk losing a recruitment project than to become the casualty of a bidding war of incentives between competing locations. Some decry the use of any incentives from state and local governments. There is no doubt that in an economist’s utopia, incentives would be unnecessary, but we don't live in that perfect world. The reality is states compete for the jobs and investment that come with corporate recruitment projects. In a free market, companies have choices on where to do business, and the resulting competition means states that want to attract jobs must produce a skilled workforce, stable business environment and high quality of life. This healthy competition goes off track when locations get into an incentives bidding war. We saw this beginning to happen when New Mexico sweetened an already enticing offer of 100 percent tax rebate with an additional $10 million subsidy. A state with strong "natural" incentives of well-educated employees, low taxes and reasonable regulations should not have to play that kind of game when recruiting companies. If a state wins every recruitment project, it is an indication that the financial incentives may be too rich. Losing a project now and then helps a state to be reflective and refine the incentives process. The second lesson is incentive parameters must be determined before negotiations begin. It is risky to try to figure out how far is too far during the heat of the moment, when emotions are heightened and the party sitting across the table can get the better of you. The Facebook recruitment clearly suffered from internal disagreement on how much incentive was acceptable. The city made an offer. The county disagreed. And the school board approved something in the middle. Having your internal negotiations play out in the public forum is not an effective way to win deals. For any company looking to relocate, no amount of financial incentive is ever enough. By nature the company will always want more. This is why it is important to have parameters set on your side of the table before you start negotiating. The third lesson is all partners must get and stay on the same page. There's no shame in losing a recruitment project when it becomes a "dialing for dollars" exercise and the company is simply searching for the highest bidder. Losing a project because of internal misunderstandings is a different matter, especially when it spills onto the front page of the paper. Elected and community leaders in Utah rightly tout our economic development “secret sauce” as our willingness to cooperate and ability to collaborate. Utah’s secret sauce has produced a long string of great results under the leadership of the Governor’s Office of Economic Development, supported by the Economic Development Corporation of Utah, in coordination with local counties and cities. The Facebook project was an unfortunate loss but gratefully a rare exception. Learning from the loss will help ensure this exception does not become a pattern. Derek B. Miller is the president and CEO of the World Trade Center Utah. Previously he was chief of staff to Gov. Gary Herbert and managing director of the Governor’s Office of Economic Development. 5 Comments Like that? Read this.

Photo: Reuters mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 2:10 PM, September 28, 2016 LONDON - Rolls-Royce <RR.L> boss Warren East has rebuilt confidence in the British engine-maker, but there are doubts among investors and industry experts about whether his slimmed-down group has the muscle to meet ambitious production and development goals. The CEO has axed more than 600 management jobs and sought to reduce production times and costs since taking the helm last July, as part of a drive to increase efficiency at a company traditionally viewed as a symbol of British engineering might. While wrestling with the restructuring, however, Rolls must almost double its output of wide-body plane engines by 2019 to meet orders. It must also replace the blades across hundreds of engines used in Dreamliners after some cracked, while designing two new jet engines, the Advance and UltraFan. A source in the company familiar with its strategy told Reuters that East's turnaround program was being felt across the business. It has eliminated 33 internal legal entities out of about 300, allowing it to cut down on back office support and internal transactions, the source said. There has also been progress on the factory floor, according to the source. At one plant in Washington, northeast England, he said Rolls had cut the time it takes to manufacture the fan and turbine discs used in its engines by 50 percent, by combining production processes and introducing robotics and faster inspection processes. East has also been shaking up the senior executive team tasked with turning around the aerospace and defense company, naming Daily Mail and General Trust's <DMGOa.L> Stephen Daintith as its new finance chief last week. The company also told Reuters that it has appointed mergers and acquisitions banker Ben Story as director of strategy and marketing and Neil Crockett, a former veteran of Cisco Systems Inc, as chief digital officer. His overhaul has buoyed the company's stock, along with the impact of the fall in the pound against the dollar after the Brexit vote, which makes Rolls engines cheaper for overseas buyers. Rolls-Royce shares are up 25 percent this year. But even some of its most supportive investors concede that, while the restructuring - which included axing a fifth of senior management jobs - might stand Rolls in good stead in the long term, it could pose problems over the next five years. "There are plenty of uncertainties out there. And if you focus on those, it could be a pretty bumpy ride," said senior portfolio manager Kave Sigaroudinia at Baillie Gifford, Rolls's fourth-biggest shareholder, according to Thomson Reuters data. "You will get operational challenges, ramping up production can create operational problems," Sigaroudinia told Reuters. A spokesman for Rolls-Royce, which issued a string of profit warnings last year, said the company was focused on making the business simpler and more efficient. "We can continue to be focused on our transformation, even while we increase engine production and invest in the new technologies that will create the next generation of Rolls-Royce civil aerospace engines," he added. EXECUTION Analysts expressed deeper concerns about the company, whose shares trade at a price to earnings ratio of 27 for 2016, compared with a sector average of in the mid-teens. That comes despite an expected halving of profits this year and no recovery to 2015's profit level in sight for the next three years. Of 24 analysts covering the stock, only two rate it a "strong buy" or a "buy", while its current 711 pence share price trades well above the consensus 627 pence target price, according to Reuters data. "Rolls looks to be priced almost for a flawless execution," said Barclays analyst Phil Buller, who has an underweight rating on the stock with a target price of 480 pence. East, 54, is one of the most celebrated technology executives in Britain, having built ARM into the country's most successful tech company in the 12 years he was CEO. But flawless execution is particularly hard to come by in the aviation industry, where the giant nature of projects mean they are regularly subject to cost-overruns and delays. At the same time as almost doubling its wide-body jet engine output, Rolls is looking at squeezing more out of its Trent XWB engine for the Airbus A350 engine by enhancing it for a potential, bigger 400-seat model of the plane, as Airbus and Boeing play leapfrog in the market for twinjets. Any problem with the availability of parts - and there are over 20,000 in each Trent XWB - or issues with quality could delay the ramp up program. It is also developing a derivative of the Trent 1000 for another Airbus jet, the A330neo. That is on top of the new Advance and UltraFan engines for wide-body jets - to be ready for service in 2020 and 2025 respectively. "The CEO acknowledged that existing engineering resources are 'stretched' against this set of programs," Bernstein analysts said after East participated in their conference this month. "But he feels confident that better process management will enable Rolls-Royce to complete these on time without reverting to adding significant headcount or facing material cost overruns." SETBACKS The aerospace industry is full of examples of projects suffering setbacks, including the delays experienced by Boeing on its 787 Dreamliner, which entered service three years late, and Airbus on its A380 project, less than two years late. Most recently, U.S. aero-engine maker Pratt & Whitney <UTX.N> in September downgraded its 2016 delivery forecast for the engines which power the Airbus A320neo, a miss which it said would put pressure on its cash flow. A problem on one of Rolls's flagship Trent 1000 engines, used to power the Boeing 787 Dreamliner, is testament to what can go wrong. ANA Holdings Inc <9202.T>, Japan's largest airline, said in August that all 100 Rolls-Royce engines on its Dreamliner fleet would need modifying following three engine failures caused by corrosion and cracking of turbine blades. Now, Rolls-Royce must set about replacing blades across all its Trent 1000s, of which there are hundreds. Boeing says that of the 445 Dreamliners in operation worldwide, about 40 percent use the Rolls-Royce engines. On top of all the other production and development challenges facing Rolls, this left the company looking like its hands were full, according to an industry source. "Boeing is likely to be asking Rolls-Royce some questions about how intensely they are going to be focused on supporting the 787 issue," the source said. Any slip-ups may make it harder to convince Boeing it has the capacity to take part in the U.S. planemaker's next likely project: a mid-market jet requiring a new engine that could cost $5 billion to $6 billion to develop. GE and Pratt & Whitney are also expected to compete for the mid-market project. For investors like Baillie Gifford, and U.S. activist investor ValueAct, which took a stake in Rolls last year based on what it sees from 2020 onwards, the company's long-term outlook holds potential. "We always take it back to the long-term view, what we have seen over the last six months is incrementally positive news," said Baillie Gifford's Sigaroudinia. "You can have a stab at what it is going to look like in 10-15 years time because these programs are so long term, and that is where our bold case comes from." Some other shareholders are more cautious. Richard Marwood, senior fund manager at Royal London Asset Management – which holds a 0.3 percent position in Rolls in its passively managed funds - said the concrete results of East's work were a long way off. "East is very well respected, but it remains to be seen if his turnaround plans can improve the transparency and predictability of the company."

Richard Marwood, senior fund manager at Royal London Asset Management – which holds a 0.3 percent position in Rolls in its passively managed funds – said the concrete results of East’s work were a long way off. “East is very well respected, but it remains to be seen if his turnaround plans can improve the transparency and predictability of the company.” (Reuters) Share Facebook Twitter Google + Stumbleupon LinkedIn Pinterest Tags British engine-maker investors market Ro Rolls-Royce Warren East Previous Football stadium land ‘lost to unpaid debts’ Next MTN denies illegal transfer of $14 billion from Nigeria Related Articles OPEC moves closer to oil output deal as Iran gets new offer November 18, 2016 Pacific rim leaders to debate future of trade post-Trump November 18, 2016 Russia’s battle for Eurobond went to the brink November 18, 2016 China SUV wars to heat up; VW unveils new models November 18, 2016 Volkswagen to cut 30,000 jobs at VW brand by 2021 November 18, 2016 UK Retail sales show strongest rise since 2002 November 17, 2016 Europe car sales drop November 17, 2016 Roche, Bristol-Myers cut cancer drug prices to win UK approval November 17, 2016 Asian markets mixed as US rally fades November 17, 2016 Check Also Siamese fighting fish sold in record auction A Siamese fighting fish with colors resembling the Thai national flag has been bought for a record breaking 53,500 baht ($1,530) at an online auction, making it the most expensive Betta fish to ever be sold.

The CEO has axed more than 600 management jobs and sought to reduce production times and costs since taking the helm last July, as part of a drive to increase efficiency at a company traditionally viewed as a symbol of British engineering might. While wrestling with the restructuring, however, Rolls must almost double its output of wide-body plane engines by 2019 to meet orders. It must also replace the blades across hundreds of engines used in Dreamliners after some cracked, while designing two new jet engines, the Advance and UltraFan. A source in the company familiar with its strategy told Reuters that East's turnaround programme was being felt across the business. It has eliminated 33 internal legal entities out of about 300, allowing it to cut down on back office support and internal transactions, the source said. There has also been progress on the factory floor, according to the source. At one plant in Washington, northeast England, he said Rolls had cut the time it takes to manufacture the fan and turbine discs used in its engines by 50 percent, by combining production processes and introducing robotics and faster inspection processes. East has also been shaking up the senior executive team tasked with turning around the aerospace and defence company, naming Daily Mail and General Trust's Stephen Daintith as its new finance chief last week. The company also told Reuters that it has appointed mergers and acquisitions banker Ben Story as director of strategy and marketing and Neil Crockett, a former veteran of Cisco Systems Inc, as chief digital officer. His overhaul has buoyed the company's stock, along with the impact of the fall in the pound against the dollar after the Brexit vote, which makes Rolls engines cheaper for overseas buyers. Rolls-Royce shares are up 25 percent this year. But even some of its most supportive investors concede that, while the restructuring - which included axing a fifth of senior management jobs - might stand Rolls in good stead in the long term, it could pose problems over the next five years. "There are plenty of uncertainties out there. And if you focus on those, it could be a pretty bumpy ride," said senior portfolio manager Kave Sigaroudinia at Baillie Gifford, Rolls's fourth-biggest shareholder, according to Thomson Reuters data. "You will get operational challenges, ramping up production can create operational problems," Sigaroudinia told Reuters. A spokesman for Rolls-Royce, which issued a string of profit warnings last year, said the company was focused on making the business simpler and more efficient. "We can continue to be focused on our transformation, even while we increase engine production and invest in the new technologies that will create the next generation of Rolls-Royce civil aerospace engines," he added. EXECUTION Analysts expressed deeper concerns about the company, whose shares trade at a price to earnings ratio of 27 for 2016, compared with a sector average of in the mid-teens. That comes despite an expected halving of profits this year and no recovery to 2015's profit level in sight for the next three years. Of 24 analysts covering the stock, only two rate it a "strong buy" or a "buy", while its current 711 pence share price trades well above the consensus 627 pence target price, according to Reuters data. "Rolls looks to be priced almost for a flawless execution," said Barclays analyst Phil Buller, who has an underweight rating on the stock with a target price of 480 pence. East, 54, is one of the most celebrated technology executives in Britain, having built ARM into the country's most successful tech company in the 12 years he was CEO. But flawless execution is particularly hard to come by in the aviation industry, where the giant nature of projects mean they are regularly subject to cost-overruns and delays. At the same time as almost doubling its wide-body jet engine output, Rolls is looking at squeezing more out of its Trent XWB engine for the Airbus A350 engine by enhancing it for a potential, bigger 400-seat model of the plane, as Airbus and Boeing play leapfrog in the market for twinjets. Any problem with the availability of parts - and there are over 20,000 in each Trent XWB - or issues with quality could delay the ramp up programme. It is also developing a derivative of the Trent 1000 for another Airbus jet, the A330neo. That is on top of the new Advance and UltraFan engines for wide-body jets - to be ready for service in 2020 and 2025 respectively. "The CEO acknowledged that existing engineering resources are 'stretched' against this set of programmes," Bernstein analysts said after East participated in their conference this month. "But he feels confident that better process management will enable Rolls-Royce to complete these on time without reverting to adding significant headcount or facing material cost overruns." SETBACKS The aerospace industry is full of examples of projects suffering setbacks, including the delays experienced by Boeing on its 787 Dreamliner, which entered service three years late, and Airbus on its A380 project, less than two years late. Most recently, U.S. aero-engine maker Pratt & Whitney in September downgraded its 2016 delivery forecast for the engines which power the Airbus A320neo, a miss which it said would put pressure on its cash flow. A problem on one of Rolls's flagship Trent 1000 engines, used to power the Boeing 787 Dreamliner, is testament to what can go wrong. ANA Holdings Inc, Japan's largest airline, said in August that all 100 Rolls-Royce engines on its Dreamliner fleet would need modifying following three engine failures caused by corrosion and cracking of turbine blades. Now, Rolls-Royce must set about replacing blades across all its Trent 1000s, of which there are hundreds. Boeing says that of the 445 Dreamliners in operation worldwide, about 40 percent use the Rolls-Royce engines. On top of all the other production and development challenges facing Rolls, this left the company looking like its hands were full, according to an industry source. "Boeing is likely to be asking Rolls-Royce some questions about how intensely they are going to be focused on supporting the 787 issue," the source said. Any slip-ups may make it harder to convince Boeing it has the capacity to take part in the U.S. planemaker's next likely project: a mid-market jet requiring a new engine that could cost $5 billion to $6 billion to develop. GE and Pratt & Whitney are also expected to compete for the mid-market project. For investors like Baillie Gifford, and U.S. activist investor ValueAct, which took a stake in Rolls last year based on what it sees from 2020 onwards, the company's long-term outlook holds potential. "We always take it back to the long-term view, what we have seen over the last six months is incrementally positive news," said Baillie Gifford's Sigaroudinia. "You can have a stab at what it is going to look like in 10-15 years time because these programmes are so long term, and that is where our bold case comes from." Some other shareholders are more cautious. Richard Marwood, senior fund manager at Royal London Asset Management - which holds a 0.3 percent position in Rolls in its passively managed funds - said the concrete results of East's work were a long way off. "East is very well respected, but it remains to be seen if his turnaround plans can improve the transparency and predictability of the company."

Trade groups representing United Continental, Boeing and other industry leaders are pushing nations to join the agreement, which would require companies to offset their emissions growth by funding environmental initiatives. The accord, being brokered in Montreal during 11 days of talks beginning Tuesday, would be the first global climate pact targeting a single industry. Exhaust from international flights accounts for about 2 percent of global greenhouse gases, yet was largely omitted from the Paris accord on climate change last year because delegates feared divvying up responsibility for global routes could derail the broader deal. With aviation emissions forecast to triple by 2050, airlines believe that regional or global regulation is inevitable. If their pollution must be controlled, airlines would prefer a single international standard, saying it would be far cheaper and easier than following a patchwork of local programs. "We recognize that as an industry, we have an impact on climate change," said Michael Gill, executive director of the Air Transport Action Group, which represents airlines, engine makers, airports and pilots. "The industry is willing to pay its share. We just want to pay our share in the most economic way possible." Deal wouldn't force airlines to cut pollution To be clear, the 15-year agreement would not force airlines to cut their pollution. Instead, companies would compensate for any emissions growth after the accord begins in 2020 by buying credits that back renewable energy development, forest preservation or other environmental endeavors. Airlines estimate the annual industrywide cost may be as much as $23.9 billion by 2035, or 1.8 percent of projected revenue. If the U.N.-sponsored deal fails, companies run the risk of facing even costlier regulation if Europe or others push ahead with regional plans. Environmentalists also are pushing for the deal in Montreal, saying it's an important first step that can be improved over time. Yet they criticize the current proposal for relying on voluntary participation during the first six years. And they say the low cost of environmental offsets could let companies off easy. "It's peanuts," said Bill Hemmings, of the Brussels-based environmental group Transport & Environment. "It gets them off the hook. Without enforced safeguards, it's a massive green-washing exercise."

Well, now I’ve heard everything! Joe Bob Briggs over at Takimag claims as much, in his most recent (and most startling) column. North Carolina governor Pat McCroy, Briggs says, is deliberately bleeding his state dry by backing a controversial law that forces residents to use public restrooms in accordance with the sex assigned on their birth certificate. Gov. McCroy’s intransigence has teed off many companies who now refuse to do business in the Tar Heel State. Paypal, Bruce Springsteen, Deutsche Bank, and many others are slashing their commercial ties, either by boycott or reduced investment. The real kicker is the NCAA pulling its All-Star Game out of Charlotte. The move is expected to cost the state millions. “Basketball is the religion of North Carolina,” Briggs writes, and this will have long-lasting effects on one of the state’s prime industries.  So what’s his fix? Briggs wants a “Southern Female intervention” for McCroy, preferably led by his grandmother. If only an Aunt Bea-like figure would give the governor a good talking to, he would come to his senses and stanch the economic fallout. Then Michael Jordan can finally show that his state isn’t full of bigots -- a goal all respectable people aspire to. For Briggs, the whole bathroom-use issue is trite and unnecessary. It’s causing the state to hemorrhage billions, all in the name of an outdated view of biology. Better to cut the losses and genuflect before Mammon, he maintains. I dissent, courteously. The reason why should be obvious to anyone sick of liberals routing conservatives on the cultural battlefield. Admittedly, I don’t have much of a dog in this fight. I’m not from the South. I’m a Yankee, living in Raytheon and Boeing county, Virginia. The economic loss North Carolina is seeing doesn’t affect me. So if Mr. Briggs wants to dismiss my criticism because my skin isn’t quite in the game, that’s fair. He would be wrong, however, to not heed my words. The sex-obsessed Left already collected one scalp in a similar fight. Last year, the Indiana legislature passed a law -- the Religious Freedom Restoration Act -- protecting the right of religious business owners to deny serving same-sex couples if doing so violated their conscience. The bill was signed into law by Governor (now vice-president nominee) Mike Pence, commencing a national outcry. What followed is a pattern of behavior similar to what’s being witnessed in North Carolina. Big business and the media teamed up to discredit the law. Gay rights activists successfully made themselves out to be on the side of righteousness, while other side was condemned as backwards, bigoted cave folk. Gov. Pence eventually relented, signing a bill that gutted the original law, rendering it meaningless. In backing down, he showed that business could be profitable by taking up the cause of sexual rights. “What this means is that today’s cultural power elite is entirely aligned with the economic power elite,” Notre Dame professor Patrick Deneen wrote at the time, “and they’re ready to steamroll anyone in their way.” Unlike other Republican pols in his position, Pat McCroy has refused to be steamrolled. He has demonstrated that he has, as Thoreau wrote, “a bone in his back which you cannot pass your hand through!” His refusal to give in to popular clamor, it seems, is no longer about upholding the law. It has become a fight to end the Left’s hubristic campaign of shutting down traditionalists via economic sanctions. And on that principle alone, Gov. McCroy should be supported. Briggs’s concern isn’t just on his wallet, though. He treats transgenderism like it’s old hat, pointing out that sex-change operations have been going on for decades. Moreover, he dismisses the fear that allowing men believing they are women to share the restroom with actual women is dangerous. Well, let’s take a look at the headlines to see if such a fear is unwarranted. A quick Google search pulled up the following: men undressing in women’s locker rooms in Seattle; a Toronto man jailed for sexually assaulting women in a shelter after claiming to be transgendered; a Virginia man arrested for filming and peeing on a 5-year-old in a girl’s bathroom; the University of Toronto ending its gender-neutral bathroom policy after two voyeurs were caught filming girls in the shower; two men in Texas busted for recording women in a Target restroom. Do these sound like instances of unsubstantiated worry? Is it really unreasonable for fathers to worry about their daughters going into restrooms that any penis-possessing male can waltz into carefree? As for transgenderism being a benign thing, as Briggs implies, that couldn’t be more wrong. A recent study co-written by Paul R. McHugh of the John Hopkins University School of Medicine and published in The New Atlantis refutes the narrative that perceived gender mismatch is harmless. Not only do transgendered individuals have a high suicide rate, they experience high levels of “social stress” and are often times the victim of sexual trauma. Andy Taylor wouldn’t personally escort Mayberry’s trans population into the bathroom of their choice. He’d protect the community by forcing them to get treated for gender dysphoria. He would understand that embracing disturbed delusions helps nobody. Still, Briggs is right on one point: McCroy’s crusade is likely to fail. Cultural conservatives have been beaten back on every stand they’ve taken in the past three decades. Their record is worse than Charlie Brown kicking the football -- liberal elites won’t even deign to set the ball for us anymore. Instead, their strategy is to peg us in the groin until total surrender. The Right has lost the Culture War. But that doesn’t mean traditionalists should just give up. As Aunt Emily said in Walker Percy’s The Moviegoer, “In this world goodness is destined to be defeated. But a man must go down fighting. That is the victory. To do anything less is to be less than a man.” Now that’s some real southern womanly advice. Allowing the Left to easily chalk up another victory without resistance only emboldens them. So keep fighting the good fight, Governor McCroy. We -- meaning any right-thinking, God-fearing Americans who don’t believe in loony leftist private-parts philosophy -- have your back.

Arcan Cetin, 20, is charged with five counts of first-degree premeditated murder after a shooting at the Cascade Mall in Burlington. He has a criminal record dating back at least two years and was charged in 2015 with assaulting his stepfather. Police said Cetin opened fire late Friday in a Macy's department store, instantly killing three women and a teenage girl and critically wounding a man who died hours later. The victims ranged in age from a 16-year-old girl to a woman in her 90s and included a probation officer and a Boeing maintenance worker. Records obtained by NBC station KING5 showed a Washington state mental health facility last year tried to have Cetin involuntarily committed. In documents filed with probation officers, a doctor checked a box indicating he was worried Cetin would harm himself, the station reported.

"We're torn up. we're hurt," David Marshall told reporters Monday as he comforted his wife. "Arcan has had mental health issues that we have been trying to work on him with. That's all I can say." Cetin was held in lieu of $2 million bail at a court appearance Monday, his first since the massacre Friday. Many in the crowded courtroom were wearing purple and blue in memory of 16-year-old murder victim Sarai Lara, NBC station KING of Seattle reported. Arcan Cetin, 20, of Oak Harbor, Wash., in an arrest photo Saturday. Washington State Patrol "Just wrong she had to die," said Justi Smith, a classmate from Mount Vernon High School in Mount Vernon. "God got another angel." Much of the shooting was caught on surveillance video. Cetin, who lives in Oak Harbor, entered the mall through "the Chuck E. Cheese entrance" and scoped out the Macy's in the mall, the warrant states. Then he went back to his car and drove it closer to the west entrance of the Macy's, where women's clothing is sold. "He was inside the store for approximately one minute," according to the warrant. "During that time, the suspect initially shot the juvenile victim near some clothing racks, and then walked through the store toward the cosmetics counter. He encountered and shot the adult male victim, then shot three adult female victims." When he was done, the warrant states, Cetin "placed the rifle that he used on top of the cosmetics counter, exited Macy's women's store through the west entrance, got into vehicle and then left the store."

Cetin is a permanent legal U.S. resident who came from Turkey, a country on the border of war-torn Syria that has been fighting Kurdish rebels for years. When asked Sunday whether they could rule out terrorism as a motive, Mount Vernon police Lt. Chris Cammock said no. But the warrant doesn't mention any possible terrorist links. Cetin faced charges last year in an assault on his stepfather after he was caught smoking marijuana inside the house, according to court records seen by The Associated Press. The young man had been diagnosed with anxiety and depression and has taken unspecified medications in the past, the records show.

Cetin said his father bought him a laptop and his mother visited him regularly at his new apartment. Social media accounts apparently belonging to Cetin included a mixture of selfies — including a picture in which he is holding a gun in his bedroom — and posts about serial killers and ISIS. A former high school contemporary described the suspected shooter as "that kid who wasn't afraid to say something offensive or vulgar." Austin Hendrix, 19, told the Seattle Times: "In high school he started harassing kids and not being a nice person, so I disassociated with him. He would grope women in high school and middle school."

 House Republicans don't want SpaceX investigating its own 'troubling' rocket failures Dave Mosher and Rebecca Harrington Sep. 29, 2016, 7:22 PM 47,282 facebook linkedin twitter email print Elon Musk. Thomson Reuters Just days after SpaceX founder Elon Musk delivered his sweeping vision of colonizing Mars, a Colorado congressman is calling on government agencies to take over an investigation of the aerospace company's recent launchpad rocket explosion. The move — a signed congressional letter dated Thursday, September 29 — follows on the heels of two recent explosions of uncrewed Falcon 9 rockets. "These failures could have spelled disaster, even loss of life, had critical national security payloads or NASA crew been aboard those rockets," the letter states. "Both SpaceX failures occurred after the Air Force certified the Falcon 9 launch vehicle for U.S. national security launches, less than fifteen months ago." Congressman Mike Coffman (R-CO) penned the four-page congressional letter, which was cosigned by nine other House Republicans. (The letter's full text is at the end of this post.) It asks for increased scrutiny of SpaceX's investigation practices, given its plans with NASA to launch astronauts to the International Space Station. It also lobs pointed questions at the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), NASA, and the US Air Force (USAF) about the certification process of SpaceX hardware, pricing schemes, risk assessment, and more. Semi-internal investigations An explosion on the launch site of a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket is shown in this still image from video in Cape Canaveral Thomson Reuters The first SpaceX incident in question was an in-flight explosion of a Falcon 9 rocket on June 28, 2015, destroying a telecommunications satellite. SpaceX chose to do an internal accident investigation with some FAA oversight, ultimately determining that a faulty strut had caused the accident. The most recent accident was a launchpad fireball of a Falcon 9 rocket on September 1, 2016, in Cape Canaveral, Florida. The percussive blaze destroyed Facebook's $200 million Amos-6 satellite, and SpaceX again exercised a federal law to perform its own investigation (since no people were harmed). That investigation isn't done, though a helium system seems to be at fault. For its ongoing investigation, SpaceX nearly doubled its team to a core group of "around 20 people," of which "more than half are representatives from FAA, NASA, US Air Force and industry experts," a company spokesperson previously told Business Insider in an email. Leading the entire group is Hans Koenigsmann — SpaceX's vice president of mission assurance. "[W]e believe he is the best person to do so," the spokesperson said. "We are collaborating very closely with the participating agencies, sharing raw data and providing access to meetings." But the 10 signers of the congressional letter do not seem satisfied with the internally led process. "We feel strongly that the current investigation should be led by NASA and the Air Force to ensure that proper investigative engineering rigor is applied and that the outcomes are sufficient to prevent NASA and military launch mishaps in the future," the draft letter states. John Taylor, a SpaceX spokesperson, declined to comment when provided a copy of the letter. A space battle on Capitol Hill Rep. Mike Coffman. Associated Press Raising issues about SpaceX, its failures, and its treatment by the US government is not a first for Coffman. As a member of the House Armed Services strategic forces subcommittee (which oversees military spacecraft), he did so in 2015 on multiple occasions, and in 2014 as well. The congressman now faces a heated 2016 reelection campaign in his district — the home of SpaceX's biggest competitor, United Launch Alliance (ULA), which is itself a joint venture between Boeing and Lockheed Martin. Records show that Coffman has publicly accepted more than $51,000 in campaign donations from Lockheed Martin during his career. Coffman has also publicly supported ULA. Samantha Masunaga, a reporter for the Los Angeles Times, captured the scuffle well in a story published in May 2016: "Traditional launch providers see their market being threatened by nontraditional entrants," said Loren Thompson, aerospace analyst with the Lexington Institute, an Arlington, Va., think tank. "Basically, this is competition between launch providers over market share and money that in the political process gets related to local interests." In 2015, United Launch Alliance spent $1.4 million on lobbying, up from $1 million the year before, according to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics, which tracks federal campaign contributions and lobbying efforts on its website opensecrets.org. That same year, SpaceX spent $1.7 million on lobbying, up from $1.5 million in 2014. The sparring has been especially heated between the two companies as they compete for government launch contracts worth tens of billions of dollars. A government rule limiting the use of Russian-made engines — which ULA has relied on for its rockets — in the launch of military spacecraft has not helped matters for the company. (SpaceX makes its own rocket engines.) Business Insider contacted Rep. Coffman's press secretary as well as ULA and Lockheed Martin for this story, but we did not immediately receive a response. A Boeing representative could not immediately provide a comment. How federal agencies initially responded A SpaceX Falcon 9 liftoff and rocket Twitter/SpaceX The letter calls on the FAA, USAF, and NASA for their responses to the letter by October 31, 2016. Business Insider forwarded both a draft and then a signed letter to those agencies as well as to the DoD (which is named in the letter) and asked for comment. Hank Price, an FAA spokesperson, told Business Insider "it'd take some time to draft a response, and we wouldn't respond to it until we'd spoken to the Congressman first." Another FAA spokesperson later told Business Insider in an email: "The FAA received the letter late Thursday afternoon and has not had a chance to review it. Safety of all operations, including commercial space, is our top priority, and the FAA is closely overseeing the accident investigation. We will respond to the members of Congress in a timely manner." NASA representatives for the agency's Human Exploration and Operations Mission Directorate told Business Insider in an email "we haven't officially received this, but even when we do, we wouldn't be able to comment in advance of responding." Laura Seal, a DoD spokesperson, told Business Insider by email that the "letter is not addressed to the Department of Defense. If we do receive a letter from Congress on this topic for response, we would respond directly to the author." Representatives at the USAF did not immediately reply.

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it Elon Musk, chief executive of SpaceX, speaks during the 67th International Astronautical Congress in Guadalajara, Mexico, on Tuesda (Susana Gonzalez/Bloomberg) By Christian Davenport September 30 Follow @wapodavenport A group of 10 Republican members of Congress wrote Thursday that they are increasingly concerned about SpaceX’s ability to safely fly NASA astronauts and national security satellites after the company recently suffered its second rocket explosion in just over a year. In a letter to the Air Force, NASA and the Federal Aviation Administration, the group said SpaceX should not be leading the investigation into its most recent failure, and that authority should be turned over to the federal government “to ensure that proper investigative engineering rigor is applied.” Last year, an unmanned Falcon 9 rocket exploded a couple minutes after it launched a resupply mission to the International Space Station, destroying $118 million worth of cargo. Then, earlier this month, another Falcon 9 rocket blew up as it was being fueled ahead of an engine test. A $195 million commercial satellite sitting on top of the rocket was lost in the fireball. [Elon Musk on mariachi bands, zero-G games, and why his Mars plan is like ‘Battlestar Galactica.’] “These failures could have spelled disaster, even loss of life, had critical national security payloads or NASA crew been aboard those rockets,” wrote the members, many of whom represent states where SpaceX’s chief competitor, the United Launch Alliance, has a strong presence. SpaceX declined to comment. After the Sept. 1 explosion, SpaceX founder Elon Musk said on Twitter that the Dragon capsule would have been able to abort in time, ferrying the astronauts on board to safety. The company has said it is narrowing down the cause of the explosion, pinpointing a breach in a second-stage helium system. Earlier this week, Musk said the investigation was “vexing and difficult.” He stressed that finding out what went wrong is the company’s “absolute top priority” but said what actually caused the explosion was still unknown. [Elon Musk’s SpaceX narrows in on cause of rocket explosion] “We’ve eliminated all of the obvious possibilities for what occurred there,” he said. “So what remains are the less probable answers.” He didn’t say what those might be. In the wake of the explosion, NASA has said it stands by SpaceX and the Air Force has said it shouldn’t affect the company’s certification. SpaceX, which relies heavily on the federal government for revenue, holds lucrative contracts with NASA to fly cargo and eventually astronauts to the space station. It also holds a certification from the Air Force that allows it to compete for contracts to launch national security satellites against the United Launch Alliance, the Colorado-based joint venture of Lockheed Martin and Boeing. The members of Congress, led by U.S. Rep. Mike Coffman (R-Colo.) questioned whether the Air Force should reconsider SpaceX’s certification. And they asked NASA whether it still plans to allow SpaceX to use the Falcon 9 for its cargo and crew missions. Since there was no loss of life or injury and no outside property was extensively damaged, federal regulations call for the launch providers to conduct the investigations with oversight from the FAA. NASA and the Air Force are also helping with the investigation. NASA declined to comment on the matter. The Air Force said it would respond to the members of Congress directly. The FAA did not immediately respond to requests for comment. business economy true Please provide a valid email address. Sign up You’re all set!

Home Companies Airbus Group to merge with its jetmaking unit: Sources Airbus Group to merge with its jetmaking unit: Sources Airbus Group SAS is likely to merge with its main planemaking unit, Airbus SAS, as part of a corporate restructuring being finalised on Thursday, people familiar with the matter said. By: Reuters | Paris | Published: September 30, 2016 1:14 AM The Frenchman will continue to run jetmaking activities, which will be solely a division rather than separate entity. (Reuters) Airbus Group SAS is likely to merge with its main plane making unit, Airbus SAS, as part of a corporate restructuring being finalised on Thursday, people familiar with the matter said. The restructuring aims to simplify a top-heavy corporate structure inherited from the group’s complex origins as a group of separate aerospace firms, and consolidate its position as a European aerospace champion anchored in Toulouse, France. A spokesman for Airbus Group declined to comment. The merger of the operational parent and jetmaking unit into one company called “Airbus” rekindles an idea debated over a decade ago, but abandoned amid disagreements among former managers and shareholders aligned with competing French and German interests. The group changed its name from EADS and overhauled its governance in 2012, limiting the influence of French and German minority state shareholdings and granting more independence to management under German-born Chief Executive Tom Enders. But it remained saddled with separate bureaucracies and confusion over the brand, with the planemaking unit keeping the core “Airbus” identity and no fewer than five CEOs spread across the parent company, three units and one geographical division. Analysts say the reorganisation will reinforce Enders as sole CEO while removing any ambiguity over his successor, as planemaking boss Fabrice Bregier steps up to become chief operating officer of the whole company. The Frenchman will continue to run jetmaking activities, which will be solely a division rather than separate entity. The impact on jobs was unclear but Enders has pledged to avoid “massive” redundancies among the 137,000 staff. Nor was it immediately clear how the new structure would fit under the company’s publicly listed legal parent, Airbus Group SE, based in the Netherlands. Shares in Europe’s rival to Boeing rose 1 percent. Highlighting its growing international focus, the decision to streamline the European firm was being thrashed out at a board meeting at a new Airbus plant in Mobile, Alabama. Due to be announced as French engineer Alstom remains mired in a political storm over a factory closure, the reorganisation will heavily talk up new digital methods, something Enders hopes will make aerospace stand out from declining industrial sectors. Sources said on Wednesday the company’s defence chief, Siemens veteran Dirk Hoke, would take a lead role in spreading digital processes and services across the group.

It uses hydrogen to generate electricity in-flight, giving it a cruising speed of 165 kilometres per hour and a range of up to 1,500km, while relying on batteries for take-off and landing. Boeing and Airbus have also tested smaller fuel cell planes in recent years as the aircraft industry searches for ways to reduce emissions. business@thenational.ae Follow The National’s Business section on Twitter Pages: Add your comment View all comments Related World’s first solar-powered helicopter takes to the air ‘Solar Impulse of the Seas’ readies for round-the-world voyage The power of innovation Solar Impulse was just the start of our investment in renewables More Aviation Supercars can now travel in style from Dubai with Emirates Skywheels US regional airline Republic set to fly out of bankruptcy soon Bombardier’s passenger jet woes spur high-cost refinancing Brazil approves Qatar Airways’ stake purchase in Chile-based Latam Airlines MOST VIEWED Business | All Standard Chartered cuts 150 jobs in the UAE, may lay off more by year-end What happens if Dubai tenant stays in property without signing new contract on expiry?

He co-authors FP’s Situation Report newsletter and has written for The Daily Beast, Wired, and War Is Boring. September 29, 2016 - 8:04 am paul.mcleary @paulmcleary   More troops to Iraq. More American troops are headed to Iraq in the ramp up to the invasion of the Islamic State-held city of Mosul, Defense Secretary Ash Carter said Wednesday: 615 of them, to be exact. The deployment will push the official number of U.S. troops on the ground there to about 5,200, though with temporary assignments and rotations, the number will be well over 6,000. Carter said the new troops will advise local forces while providing logistics support during the operation to seize Mosul, Iraq’s second largest city that has been in ISIS hands for over two years. Many of the newly arriving troops will head for the Al Asad air base northwest of Ramadi in Anbar province, where the U.S. already has several hundred troops training Iraqi forces along with a M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS), which delivers punishing long-range pinprick strikes. FP has lots more on the HIMARS in Iraq, here. Air strikes everywhere. President Barack Obama is ready to extend the U.S. bombing campaign on Islamic State targets in Libya for a third month, Fox News’ Lucas Tomlinson scoops, amid continuing resistance from the fighters in the city of Sirte. The U.S. Marines flying from the USS Wasp have already conducted 175 strikes in and around Sirte since Aug. 1, and despite Pentagon officials insisting at the time that the campaign would take “weeks, not months,” it’s taking months. An American strike Wednesday in Somalia that the Pentagon says killed nine al Shabab fighters is under closer scrutiny, as one local military commander says the U.S. was tricked by one of his rivals into bombing his soldiers, killing 22. The U.S. military is looking into the matter, defense officials said Wednesday. In Aleppo, some analysts are saying that the utter destruction being wrought by Russian and Syrian planes is part of a concerted strategy to drive moderate rebel groups into the hands of more extremist elements, thereby muting any international protests to bombing any anti-Assad forces and propping up the regime in Damascus. Life in Aleppo. A gripping read here from the Washington Post’s Liz Sly and Louisa Loveluck about how those Russian and Syrian planes hit targets at night, and the toll it’s taking. Around 1,700 bombs have fallen in rebel-held eastern Aleppo in the week after the ceasefire’s collapse, with two more hospitals being hit Wednesday night: “The bombings at night are the worst. There is no electricity in the rebel-held portion of eastern Aleppo, and the warplanes flying overhead target any light piercing the blackness beneath. So families huddle together in the dark, gathered in one room so that they don’t die alone, listening to the roar of the jets and waiting for the bombs to fall. After they do, rescue workers venture out, navigating the rubble and craters left by earlier bombings, to dig out victims without headlights or lamps. They haul them to hospitals swamped with patients being treated on the floor by doctors who barely sleep and must choose which lives to save and which to let go.” Manilla turning everything on its head. If Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte makes good on his threats to walk away from his country’s 65-year-old alliance with the United States, FP’s Dan De Luce writes in a great piece on the latest South China Sea headache for the Obama administration, “the first casualty would likely be the U.S. military mission there, which has become a model for successful counterterrorism operations worldwide.” Duterte has already warned that the U.S. military contingent of several hundred troops has to go, and on Wednesday said an upcoming joint military exercise would be the last with the United States. But his threat to push out the team of up to 100 U.S. Special Operations Forces, along with an additional 300 to 500 American conventional troops, “comes as concerns mount in Washington and Southeast Asia about the Islamic State’s efforts to spread its tentacles in the region,” De Luce says. Congress to Obama: here’s your veto. Congress handed president Obama the first veto override of his presidency Wednesday, overruling him on his opposition to a bill that would allow the families of the victims of the 9/11 attacks to sue the government of Saudi Arabia. FP’s Paul McLeary notes that while the Republican-controlled Congress was more than happy to thwart the president, many in Congress expect the bill to be tweaked in the upcoming lame duck session, making it more difficult for the lawsuits to go through, and putting up barriers to foreigners suing Washington over civilian deaths in counterterrorism operations. In a CNN Town Hall Wednesday evening, President Obama called the vote a mistake, “the problem with that is that if we eliminate this notion of sovereign immunity, then our men and women in uniform around the world could potentially start seeing ourselves subject to reciprocal loss, right?” McCain vs. Kerry vs. Russian delusions. Republican Senators John McCain and Lindsey Graham put Secretary of State John Kerry on full blast Wednesday, issuing a blistering statement sarcastically applauding Kerry for taking a hard stance with his Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov over the Russian bombing campaign in Syria. FP’s Paul McLeary catalogues the back and forth which ended with the Senate duo mocking that if the talks are off between Kerry and the Russians over a ceasefire in Syria, as Kerry threatened, “we can only imagine that having heard the news, Vladimir Putin has called off his bear hunt and is rushing back to the Kremlin to call off Russian airstrikes on hospitals, schools, and humanitarian aid convoys around Aleppo.” Good morning and as always, if you have any thoughts, announcements, tips, or national  security-related events to share, please pass them along to SitRep HQ. Best way is to send them to: paul.mcleary@foreignpolicy.com or on Twitter: @paulmcleary or @arawnsley 2016 One of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump’s top foreign policy advisors is headed to Japan. Retired Lt. General Mike Flynn says he’ll visit Tokyo in order to give America’s allies in east Asia a clearer idea of what a potential Trump administration’s policy views would be. Trump has repeatedly complained that American allies like Japan enjoy the protection of America’s security umbrella but do not, in his view, fairly compensate the United States. North Korea A North Korean soldier just finished one of the most dangerous trips you can make, sneaking his way across the tense, mine-laden demilitarized zone between North and South Korea in order to defect. The unnamed soldier traveled unarmed and managed not to draw fire from either side’s forces. Thus far, North Korea hasn’t acted up following the soldier’s defection but South Korean troops are bracing for the possibility of a violent tantrum from Pyongyang. Syria Make Turkey great again. Turkey is close to finishing 560 mile wall along its border with Syria in order to deal with the threat of terrorist infiltration. The wall, begun in 2014, should be finished by February of 2017, Turkish officials tell Reuters. The 10-ft. high wall will be laced with razor wire and manned by private security. Turkey’s wall is one of a number of such counterterrorism barriers going up along the borders of the middle east, with countries like Saudi Arabia, Afghanistan, and Libya each trying to fence out problems with their neighbors. Business of defense The White House has finally given its blessing to the sale of at least $7 billion worth of fighter jets to Qatar, Kuwait, and Bahrain, Defense News reports. Under the deal, Qatar will get 72 F-15E Strike Eagles and Kuwait will get F/A-18 E/F Super Hornets. Bahrain also plans to buy 17 F-16s. The sale had been delayed, to the ire of lawmakers like Senators John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), but the deal will keep open a Boeing production line in St. Louis, Missouri. Israel also protested that the deal could undermine its qualitative military edge in the region, but its concerns should be allayed in the face of a new $38 billion in military financing from Washington. Bots o’ war The U.S. Army is gearing up for a battlefield that could one day include Russian drones directing artillery fire from the skies. Defense One reports on recent comments by Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster about the Army’s efforts to turn soldiers into drone killers. The Army’s approach to the threat of Russian drones involves developing radar systems that can identify the smaller aircraft as well as lasers and electronic warfare equipment that can either zap or jam them out of the skies. The next step for the Army includes actually fielding the anti-drone equipment. For the first time ever, one of the Navy’s robotic helicopters designated a target for a missile fired by a manned chopper. An MQ-8B Fire Scout and an MH-60S took off from different bases for the test, and the Fire Scout called the shot for a Hellfire missile from the Seahawk, successfully hitting the target. Manned-unmanned teaming, the integration of platforms operated autonomously and by humans, is an area of growing interest within the U.S. military. Marines The Marine Corps has a new operating concept and it involves working more closely with the service’s counterparts in the Army, Breaking Defense reports. The concept upgrades the “three block war” concept, in which grunts have to conduct a spectrum of operations ranging from humanitarian work to open warfare within the span of three blocks with the latest concept adding information operations into that mix. Technology is also a big part of the implementing the concept, with Marine Corps Commandant Robert Neller saying he’d like to field a quadcopter with each infantry squad and one day get the ability to 3D-print drones.

Moscow has deep regrets over the low quality of an international probe into the MH17 crash in Ukraine while Russia is still ready to provide assistance in the investigation, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said on Thursday. "We deeply regret over the low quality of the international probe into the Malaysian Boeing disaster in Ukraine in 2014 and its politicized nature, which have become finally obvious for all after yesterday’s report by a representative of a joint investigative team," Zakharova said. "Yesterday, unfounded and unsubstantiated claims were announced on their behalf that the military hardware that had shot down the Boeing had allegedly crossed into the Russian border," the spokeswoman said.

"Competent Russian specialists have carried out an expert study of one of these records," the diplomat said. "It was clearly established that this was doctored up," she said. "Again, we didn’t hear any specifics that would be based on facts," the spokeswoman said. "We’re again calling on colleagues to turn to facts and begin work with reliable information. The Russian side expresses the desire to assist in this effort," she said. {{item.group_date}} {{item.suffix?", "+item.suffix:""}} Show more Share Persons Maria Zakharova Topics Russian Foreign Ministry Boeing 777 crash in Ukraine Top News November 18, 15:20 Putin says Russia seeks to maintain world’s strategic balance of power November 18, 15:20 November 18, 15:44 Russian premier: Russia regains status of leading player on world’s food market November 18, 15:44 November 18, 16:04 Deputy PM says agriculture is engine of Russian economic growth November 18, 16:04 November 18, 15:53 PM Medvedev’s coffee joke may add ‘Russiano’ to country’s beverage menu November 18, 15:53 In other media Реклама Photo 4 Crimea’s ex-prosecutor Poklonskaya takes helm at State Duma’s Commission on MPs’ income 4 Putin: Uzbek people can count on Russia’s support 3 Russia's Kirov Region governor detained on suspicion of taking €0.4 mln bribe Infographics Russia's gas pipelines to Europe by 2018 Russia’s state defense order in 2015 Chinese Lunar Exploration Program Russia’s Angara A5 heavy-load space carrier rocket Most read Now Today This week 1 Clarivate Analytics Names 2016 Highly Cited Researchers 2 Russian Army to receive missiles with warheads based on new physical principles 3 Russian expert on accuracy of Kh-101 cruise missiles used against terrorists in Syria 4 Russian Defense Ministry says ‘Aleppo bombings blunder’ will leave stain on Kirby’s bio 5 Ukraine is considering extradition of Saakashvili to Georgia — media 6 Russia's Tupolev-95MSM bomber delivers first-ever strike on mission to Syria 7 Russia’s first pro-Trump rally to be held in Kaluga region 1 Russia's Tupolev-95MSM bomber delivers first-ever strike on mission to Syria 2 Russia's 'Night Hunter': from maiden flight to fighting ISIS 3 Russian bombers deliver strike at terrorist strongholds in Syria — Defense Ministry 4 Obama calls Russia ‘military superpower,’ important partner 5 Family of Russian officer killed in Syria writes letter to Hollande 6 Russian Army to receive missiles with warheads based on new physical principles 7 Russian diplomat says Lavrov, Kerry to discuss US ‘shocking’ treatment of RT television 1 Russian forces launch large-scale operation against terrorists in Syria 2 MIG-29 fighter jet crashes into Mediterranean off Syrian coast 3 Russia's Tupolev-95MSM bomber delivers first-ever strike on mission to Syria 4 Russia declines to ratify International Criminal Court Statute 5 Obama calls Russia ‘military superpower,’ important partner 6 Russian bombers deliver strike at terrorist strongholds in Syria — Defense Ministry 7 Putin sets task to ensure reliable protection of Russian forces in Syria TOP STORIES US presidential election 2016 Conflict in Syria Russia's defense industry Oil & Gas Industry Space programs Реклама News World Russian Politics & Diplomacy Business & Economy Military & Defense Science & Space Society & Culture Sport Press Review Sections Tags Media Press Releases Infographics About us TASS TODAY AGENCY NEWS TASS HISTORY MANAGEMENT CONTACTS Services TASS-PHOTO TASS-ONLINE TASS Beta-version.

The 10-minute test flight Thursday at Stuttgart Airport in southwestern Germany involved two pilots and two dummy passengers. The twin-cabin plane, known as HY4, was developed by aircraft maker Pipistrel, fuel cell specialist Hydrogenics, the University of Ulm and the German Aerospace Center DLR.

(Christoph Schmidt/dpa via AP) It uses hydrogen to generate electricity in-flight, giving it a cruising speed of 165 kilometers per hour (102.5 mph) and a range of up to 1,500 kilometers (932 miles), while relying on batteries for take-off and landing. Boeing and Airbus have also tested smaller fuel cell planes in recent years as the aircraft industry searches for ways to reduce emissions.
