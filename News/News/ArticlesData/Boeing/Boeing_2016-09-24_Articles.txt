 An airline pilot reveals why the Boeing 757 is truly unique Benjamin Zhang, Business Insider Sep. 25, 2016, 11:13 AM 17,984 facebook twitter pinterest email copy link American Airlines Boeing 757.Flickr/Aero Icarus Twelve years after Boeing discontinued the 757, the long-time 'tweener in the company's lineup is still popular among U.S. airlines. American, Delta, and United all operate large fleets of the airplane. Even though the Renton, Washington-based plane maker booked more than 1,000 orders for the jet over its two decades in production, it was never a hot seller. By the early 2000's, sales of the 757 had all but dried up, and Boeing put the plane out to pasture in 2004. Although many of the planes are pushing 25 years of service, airlines are hanging onto their 757s. For instance, Delta, who has spent big bucks on a fleet of new jets, recently refurbished the cabins of its aging 757s instead of replacing them with newer planes.  So why are its customer's so loyal? Is the 757 that good? To get some answers, Business Insider recently spoke with author and Boeing 757 pilot Patrick Smith about the plane. "There's no denying the 757 is an old plane that was designed in the late 1970s, but the versatility of the plane is remarkable and unmatched," Smith, the author of the book Cockpit Confidential, told Business Insider in an interview. "It's profitable on both short-haul domestic as well as trans-Atlantic routes." Delta Boeing 757.REUTERS/Tami Chappell During it's production life, the 757 was always a bit of an oddity — a 'tweener of sorts. It's larger and offers greater range than the average narrow body jet, but smaller and cheaper to operate than a wide-body. Boeing and its customers, for many years, didn't quite know how to take full advantage of the plane's capabilities. However, when they did figure it out, it became an integral part of the operators' fleets.  Boeing is currently marketing a new stretched variant of its long-serving 737 — called the MAX 9 —  as a potential replacement for the 757. Now, there's talk that Boeing may make the 737 even larger to get closer to the 757's capacity.  "Boeing is trying to push the 737 as a viable 757 replacement," Smith said, "In some respects it can and in some respects it can't." For instance, the 737 simply isn't capable of the same kind of engine performance as the 757. According to Smith, the 737 falls way short of the 757 in terms of runway performance. The 737 requires a much higher takeoff speed and much more runway to get off the ground.  "The 757 can be off the ground in 4,000 ft. and under 140 knots," he told us. However, Smith recounts being in the cockpit jump seat of a 737 as two other pilots were flying. During takeoff, the author noticed that the plane didn't lift off until 160 knots and used up much more runway. Furthermore, the 757 can comfortably climb straight to its cruising altitude. On the other hand, the 737 requires a step climb procedure that calls for the plane to climb to a certain altitude and burn off some fuel to lighten the load before climbing to a higher altitude.  Runway performance matters. Especially when it comes to the type of flying the 757 and the 737 are asked to perform — trans-continental or oceanic flights with a full payload out of smaller secondary airports.  Boeing 737 MAX 9.Boeing "The 737 falls short when you're trying to fly it longer haul, coast to coast. It can do it, but not by much," Smith said. In addition, when it comes to flying across the Atlantic, "there's is concern in the winter, when there are ferocious head winds, the 737 may need to stop for fuel." The reality is that Smith believes the Boeing 737 is a good plane, but is being asked to take on a mission the design wasn't meant to perform. "The Boeing 737 was essentially conceived as a small regional jet nearly five decades ago," Smith told us. "It's an extremely popular plane, but it's being asked to perform missions it wasn't designed for." As a result, Boeing is simply not in a position to bolt bigger engines onto the 737. Since its introduction in the 1960s, Boeing has been installing larger and larger engines on the 737 as the size of the plane grew. Unfortunately, the amount of room underneath the wings hasn't changed. Thus, Boeing has all but maxed out on the size of the engines it can mount on the 737 without completely redesigning the plane's under carriage.  Instead of a stretched 737, Smith believes Boeing should have gone for an updated version of the 757 at some point during its production run. "Somewhere along the way, had Being just re-engined the 757 with a new cockpit and new internal systems, it could have been a big hit," Smith told us. In a statement to Business Insider, a Boeing spokesperson wrote: "The 737 MAX will extend the Next-Generation 737 range advantage with the capability to fly more than 3,500 nautical miles. That’s an increase of 340-570 nmi over the (current generation) 737NG which gives our customers the flexibility to open up new markets." Icelandair Boeing 757.Flickr/Eric Salard With that said, the 757 isn't a perfect plane. "It's a 6-across (seating) narrow body that's long and thin," Smith said. "And for passengers, it can take a long time to board and disembark."  In addition, the 757's cockpit is pretty old-fashioned when compared to modern airliners such as the 737 MAX. The controls of the 757 are also much heavier for pilots than its sibling — the Boeing 767. The 757 and 767 were developed at the same time and feature virtually identical cockpits.  Finally, the Boeing 757 leaves a massive amount of wake turbulence as it flies — forcing air traffic controllers to keep other planes far away from passing 757s.  "No one really knows why, but the 757 has really strong wake turbulence," Smith told us. "The early 757s had worse wake turbulence than the 747." Although Smith added that the addition of winglets on later 757s have greatly decreased the wake turbulence. The Boeing 757 is an aircraft that's come and gone. It's served its tour of duty with honor and distinction. Now, it's time for Boeing to find a replacement worthy of stepping into its shoes.  Read the original article on Business Insider. Copyright 2016. Follow Business Insider on Twitter.

Karen was born in Culver City, CA, to Henry and Lena Rosenberger on October 10, 1950. She graduated with high honors from Eastmont High School in 1969. She lettered in her favorite sport, tennis. Moving on to Western Washington State College, she received a degree in education. Karen decided not to pursue teaching, rather taking a civil service position in 1972 with the U.S. Air Force Plant Representative Office (AFPRO) at Boeing Plant 2, Seattle, WA. She began as a Procurement Clerk with the Minuteman Missile Program. She subsequently completed training and received her warrant as an Administrative Contracting Officer (ACO). Karen was ACO for the Minuteman program for a short time, and in 1984 she became ACO for the E-3 Sentry, Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS). She was responsible for administering the U.S. Government contracts for the USAF, NATO, Saudi and Japanese AWACS programs. As the U.S. Government representative, Karen accepted delivery of each E-3 aircraft from The Boeing Company. During her time in this position, she was awarded numerous awards and citations for her work performance. Karen frequently travelled internationally representing the U.S. Air Force. The AFPRO later became part of the Defense Contract Management Agency, from which Karen retired on October 4, 2002. During her time at the Boeing facility, Karen met and married Lt. Col. Jack Pierson (USAF/Retired), who was also working at the Boeing plant. After retirement, she and Jack moved to the Sequim area, building their retirement place on 20 acres of land up on Blue Mountain. After Jack’s untimely death, Karen sold the house and moved down the mountain to her new home in Sequim. Oh, how she loved her new home. She made many trips over the mountains back to Quincy, WA, to see her family. We always looked forward to spending time with Karen. She was a huge supporter of many local events and artists in the Sequim area. Karen was a diehard 12 Seahawk fan, attending home games with her long-time friend, Jim Doherty. They attended Super Bowl XLIX and that result really upset her. She always flew a Seahawks flag at her home during the season. She loved watching her beloved Hawks, especially Richard Sherman, Kam Chancellor and Russell Wilson. The Hawks have lost a true fan. Karen was preceded in death by her parents, Henry and Lena Rosenberger; her husband, Jack H. Pierson; her brother, Jim Rosenberger of Rock Island, WA; her niece, Gwen Taylor; and nephew, Mark Rosenberger of Quincy, WA. She is survived by her sister, Margy, Wenatchee, WA; brother, Ken, Wenatchee, WA; sister-in-law, Marilyn, Wenatchee, WA; brother, Gene and wife, Rhonda, Quincy, WA; nephew, Corey and wife, Taran, Quincy, WA; niece, Susie and husband, Bob, Covington, WA; nephew, Michael and wife, Stephanie, Salmon, ID; step-son, Barclay Pierson and wife, Lorri, Renton, WA; step-son, Graham Pierson and wife, Belen, VA; great-nephews and nieces, Ben and Cameron Williams; Zack, Moses and Titus Taylor; Hunter and Ashlyn Rosenberger; Caitlyn and Chase Schuler; Rachel and Stecker Pierson and Briana Pierson. Plans for celebrating Karen’s life will be announced at a later date. Please leave a memory for the family or sign their on-line guestbook, www.scharbachs.com.

Rich Smith (TMFDitty) Sep 25, 2016 at 12:13PM Image source: Arianspace.  "Arianespace confirms its status as the most reliable launch services provider in the marketplace." -- Arianespace I have to admit, when Arianespace made this boast last week -- just days after I penned a column ranking the success records of the big three space launchers United Launch Alliance (ULA), Arianespace, and SpaceX, in that order -- my eyebrows raised a bit. At last count, United Launch Alliance -- the Boeing (NYSE:BA) and Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) joint venture -- had successfully launched 111 rockets into orbit, in a row, without any of them blowing up in the process. Airbus-controlled (NASDAQOTH:EADSY) Arianespace, on the other hand, with an enviable record of 73 straight successful Ariane 5 rocket launches, looked like the second "most reliable launch services provider in the marketplace" -- not the first. And yet, when you dig into the numbers, there does seem to be an argument to be made in Arianespace's favor. For one thing, Arianespace has been in business longer than ULA. (Prior to ULA's formation 10 years ago, Boeing and Lockheed operated as separate launch providers. Arianespace, which according to S&P Global Market Intelligence was established in 1979, thus had a head start on ULA -- and has operated without mishap for the last 13 years). All of which got me thinking: Now that SpaceX has blown up another rocket, and is temporarily sidelined from the "most reliable" race, could it be true that Airbus' spaciest subsidiary is more reliable than United Launch Alliance? And if that is true, then when combined with the lower prices Ariane charges for launch services, could this be bad news for ULA's business -- and for Boeing and Lockheed's profits? Digging into the numbers Ariane's press release boasts an impressive number of "firsts" and "mosts." Of course, it's largely a marketing document, so let's put a few of its claims to the test, starting with... Ariane: The biggest booster? In August 2016, an Ariane 5 launcher boosted 10,735 kg into geostationary transfer orbit (GTO -- a much higher orbit than standard low earth orbit, or LEO), its largest payload ever. That was an impressive accomplishment -- because according to Ariane's own website, the Ariane 5 is only rated to carry 10 tons of cargo (10,000 kg) to GTO. 10,735 kg is also nearly two tons more than SpaceX says its Falcon 9 rocket can lift. And yet, according to ULA's website, ULA's Delta IV heavy rocket is capable of launching more than 13,800 kg to GTO. Meanwhile, SpaceX's upcoming Falcon Heavy rocket will boast a 22,200 kg maximum... Ariane: Most prolific? Ariane has launched seven rockets so far this year, off a launch manifest of 11. That's a good start to the year. At last report, though, ULA had already launched eight times -- and planned to conduct as many as 15 Atlas V and Delta IV launches this year. SpaceX, too, notched eight successful launches before its September "anomaly." Ariane: Biggest backlog? Shifting from boasts of what it has done, to what it plans to do in the future, Ariane notes that it "has won a total of eight new contracts in 2016," and now has "an order book worth 5.3 billion euros" ($5.9 billion) for future launches. These are impressive stats. They may even be better than what United Launch Alliance can claim. Inquiring of the latter's total, I was informed that United Launch Alliance does not disclose the size of its order book because that information is "proprietary." SpaceX, on the other hand, is more than happy to tell investors how much business it has landed -- "over $10 billion in contracts," or nearly twice Ariane's tally. Ariane: Where are the profits? Left unmentioned in Ariane's press release is one fact that arguably matters most to investors (including, one imagines, Ariane's own majority shareholder, Airbus): Profits. In its April report on financial results for fiscal 2015, Ariane reported generating $1.6 billion. However, it earned only $4.5 million in profit on that revenue -- a fact that even Arianespace admitted meant it was operating at only "break-even." In contrast, ULA earned operating profits nearly 100 times as large last year -- $400 million. So what does this mean for investors in Boeing and Lockheed? Good news! Ariane is a superb company, boasting an admirable record of success on multiple launch platforms, launch prices that beat ULA with a stick, and -- once the Ariane 6 is built -- a decent chance of competing against SpaceX on price. Ariane is not, however, the clear winner in the space race. Indeed, the most surprising revelation to come out of this whole exercise is this: United Launch Alliance stacks up pretty well against Arianespace -- even in the areas where Ariane says it is establishing "performance records." And when it comes to profits, ULA stands head and shoulders above Ariane. Admittedly, this fact may itself be a factor of Ariane not charging as much on its launches as ULA does. But for investors, it's the bottom line that counts. And that's where United Launch Alliance, and by extension, its Boeing and Lockheed Martin owners, clearly win the race.

"There's no denying the 757 is an old plane that was designed in the late 1970s, but the versatility of the plane is remarkable and unmatched," Smith, the author of the book Cockpit Confidential, told Business Insider in an interview. "It's profitable on both short-haul domestic as well as trans-Atlantic routes." Delta Boeing 757.REUTERS/Tami Chappell During it's production life, the 757 was always a bit of an oddity — a 'tweener of sorts. It's larger and offers greater range than the average narrow body jet, but smaller and cheaper to operate than a wide-body. Boeing and its customers, for many years, didn't quite know how to take full advantage of the plane's capabilities. However, when they did figure it out, it became an integral part of the operators' fleets.  Boeing is currently marketing a new stretched variant of its long-serving 737 — called the MAX 9 —  as a potential replacement for the 757. Now, there's talk that Boeing may make the 737 even larger to get closer to the 757's capacity.  "Boeing is trying to push the 737 as a viable 757 replacement," Smith said, "In some respects it can and in some respects it can't." For instance, the 737 simply isn't capable of the same kind of engine performance as the 757. According to Smith, the 737 falls way short of the 757 in terms of runway performance. The 737 requires a much higher takeoff speed and much more runway to get off the ground.  "The 757 can be off the ground in 4,000 ft. and under 140 knots," he told us. However, Smith recounts being in the cockpit jump seat of a 737 as two other pilots were flying. During takeoff, the author noticed that the plane didn't lift off until 160 knots and used up much more runway. Furthermore, the 757 can comfortably climb straight to its cruising altitude. On the other hand, the 737 requires a step climb procedure that calls for the plane to climb to a certain altitude and burn off some fuel to lighten the load before climbing to a higher altitude.  Runway performance matters. Especially when it comes to the type of flying the 757 and the 737 are asked to perform — trans-continental or oceanic flights with a full payload out of smaller secondary airports.  Boeing 737 MAX 9.Boeing "The 737 falls short when you're trying to fly it longer haul, coast to coast. It can do it, but not by much," Smith said. In addition, when it comes to flying across the Atlantic, "there's is concern in the winter, when there are ferocious head winds, the 737 may need to stop for fuel." The reality is that Smith believes the Boeing 737 is a good plane, but is being asked to take on a mission the design wasn't meant to perform. "The Boeing 737 was essentially conceived as a small regional jet nearly five decades ago," Smith told us. "It's an extremely popular plane, but it's being asked to perform missions it wasn't designed for." As a result, Boeing is simply not in a position to bolt bigger engines onto the 737. Since its introduction in the 1960s, Boeing has been installing larger and larger engines on the 737 as the size of the plane grew. Unfortunately, the amount of room underneath the wings hasn't changed. Thus, Boeing has all but maxed out on the size of the engines it can mount on the 737 without completely redesigning the plane's under carriage.  Instead of a stretched 737, Smith believes Boeing should have gone for an updated version of the 757 at some point during its production run. "Somewhere along the way, had Being just re-engined the 757 with a new cockpit and new internal systems, it could have been a big hit," Smith told us. In a statement to Business Insider, a Boeing spokesperson wrote: "The 737 MAX will extend the Next-Generation 737 range advantage with the capability to fly more than 3,500 nautical miles. That’s an increase of 340-570 nmi over the (current generation) 737NG which gives our customers the flexibility to open up new markets." Icelandair Boeing 757.Flickr/Eric Salard With that said, the 757 isn't a perfect plane. "It's a 6-across (seating) narrow body that's long and thin," Smith said. "And for passengers, it can take a long time to board and disembark."  In addition, the 757's cockpit is pretty old-fashioned when compared to modern airliners such as the 737 MAX. The controls of the 757 are also much heavier for pilots than its sibling — the Boeing 767. The 757 and 767 were developed at the same time and feature virtually identical cockpits.  Finally, the Boeing 757 leaves a massive amount of wake turbulence as it flies — forcing air traffic controllers to keep other planes far away from passing 757s.  "No one really knows why, but the 757 has really strong wake turbulence," Smith told us. "The early 757s had worse wake turbulence than the 747." Although Smith added that the addition of winglets on later 757s have greatly decreased the wake turbulence. The Boeing 757 is an aircraft that's come and gone. It's served its tour of duty with honor and distinction. Now, it's time for Boeing to find a replacement worthy of stepping into its shoes.  Read the original article on Business Insider. Copyright 2016. Follow Business Insider on Twitter.

A Department of Defense release said the Boeing, the weapon manufacturer, is being awarded the $81,271,024 contract for firm-fixed-price modification to a previously awarded firm-fixed-price contract to exercise an option for the procurement of 22 Lot 89 Harpoon missiles and associated containers and components for India under the Foreign Military Sales programme. The contract is expected to be completed in June 2018. In 2014, India requested the US government for the Harpoon missiles for Shishumar class submarine. The request was made under Foreign Military Sale. The US Defence Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) had July 2014 said that the Indian government has requested a possible sale of 12 UGM-84L Harpoon Block II Encapsulated Missiles, 10 UTM-84L Harpoon Encapsulated Training missiles, 2 Encapsulated Harpoon certification training vehicles, containers, spare and repair parts, support and test equipment, personnel training and training equipment, publications and technical data, US Government and contractor engineering and logistics support services, and other related elements of logistics support. The estimated cost is $200 million. It said that this weapon system, to be employed on the Shishumar class submarine (Type-209), will provide enhanced capabilities for defence of critical sea lines of communication. "India has already purchased Harpoon missiles for integration on Indian Air Force's Jaguar aircraft and Indian Navy's P-8I maritime patrol aircraft. India will have no difficulty absorbing these additional missiles into its armed forces," it added. Sources in the industry said that a contract was signed this June between Indian Ministry of Defence and US Department of Defense for supply of Harpoon systems for the submarines. To execute this contract, the US government has to buy the missiles from Boeing to supply to India. --IANS rs/vd Advertisement << Previous Article   «Back Ad Ad Most Read Demonetisation: Get Rs 2,000 cash at petrol pumps from Nov 18 ATMs in small cities, villages will take weeks to be ready More trouble ahead as Tata Trusts get I-T summons for tax avoidance Modus Operandi: How black money hoarders are trying to escape I-T lens Ratan Tata should step down for crisis to abate: 6 suggestions from NYU's Damodaran More From Current Affairs Senior UP official injured in Expressway crash Morocco to support Fiji in organising COP23 Our railway budgets aim development, not politics: PM Bhartiya Mazdoor Sangh calls for scrapping income tax Demonetisation main issue in Bengal by-polls [ more ] Top Stories No note exchange at banks tomorrow; senior citizens exempted Shekhar Gupta: The WhatsApp governance ATMs in small cities, villages will take weeks to be ready Bajaj commences production of 400-cc bike from Chakan plant Demonetisation: Govt may do away with cash exchange gradually [ more ] Markets MCX to levy concentration margin from December Gold quotes at huge discount, price hits 4-month low Diamond exporters eye 8-10% rise in exports in coming quarter Nifty nears 6-month low, Sensex ends 77 points lower Vakrangee, Oil India, Engineers India, Infibeam Incorporation hit 52-week high [ more ] Companies Vikram Johri: Lessons from a scandal Bajaj commences production of 400-cc bike from Chakan plant Natco plans to double drug filings next year Infosys invests Rs 14.5 crore in Danish artificial intelligence start-up No Indian Pharma company in world Access to Medicine Index [ more ] Opinion Shekhar Gupta: The WhatsApp governance Why Gruh Finance isn't a top pick among analysts anymore?

Friday, 18 November 2016 اردو Türkçe العربیة فارسی Toggle navigation TASNIM NEWS .com Home All Stories Politics Economy World Defense Nuclear Society/Culture Science Sports Tourism Other Media Photos Interview Airbus, Boeing Representatives Due in Tehran Later This Month: Minister News ID: 1195030 Service: Economy September, 24, 2016 - 19:00 TEHRAN (Tasnim) – Iranian Minister of Road and Urban Development Abbas Akhoundi said Saturday that representatives of Airbus and Boeing will travel to Tehran later this month to finalize talks on Iran’s purchase of passenger planes. Financial negotiations for the purchase of jetliners are underway with Airbus and Boeing, Akhoundi told reporters on Wednesday. He added that representatives of the two leading aviation rivals will travel to the Iranian capital in a few days to discuss legal issues related to the purchase of the aircraft. “After completing the legal talks, (we will) enter technical negotiations…,” he said. His remarks came after a spokesman for Airbus said on Wednesday that it had received two licenses from the US Treasury allowing it to export a total of 17 aircraft to Iran. Although based in Europe, Airbus needs US approval because of the high number of US parts in its jets. The US Treasury is expected to start approving sales of Boeing jets within days as well. Iran provisionally agreed earlier this year to buy over 200 jets worth $50 billion at list prices from Airbus and Boeing following the removal of anti-Tehran sanctions. Later, the US House of Representatives in July passed two amendments that would stop the aircraft sales, although to become law they need to be approved by the Senate and signed by President Barack Obama. While the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) - a lasting nuclear deal between Tehran and world powers- came into force in January, some Iranian officials have complained about the US failure to fully implement the accord. Back in March, Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Seyed Ali Khamenei said Americans have yet to fulfill what they were supposed to do as per the nuclear deal. Iran still has problems in its banking transactions or in restoring its frozen assets, because Western countries and those involved in such processes are afraid of Americans, the Leader said at the time, criticizing the US for its moves to prevent Iran from taking advantage of the sanctions removal.

Low-cost carriers and full-service airlines have been adding jets and expanding new point-to-point services to cater for both leisure and business travel demand from a rising middle class in China and throughout Asia. US manufacturer Boeing says China is forecasted to become the world’s first trillion dollar market for new aircraft over the next two decades. Its latest China version of its Current Market Outlook (CMO) projects a demand for 6,810 new aircraft in the country over the next 20 years, valued at $1.025 trillion at list prices. Boeing predicts China will need 5,110 new single-aisle aircraft through 2035, accounting for 75 percent of the total new deliveries. Low-cost carriers and full-service airlines have been adding jets and expanding new point-to-point services to cater for both leisure and business travel demand from a rising middle class in China and throughout Asia. "As China transitions to a more consumer-based economy, aviation will play a key role in its economic development," said Randy Tinseth, vice president of marketing, Boeing Commercial Airplanes. "Because travel and transportation are key services, we expect to see passenger traffic grow 6.4 percent annually in China over the next 20 years." Boeing forecasts the widebody fleet will triple in size, requiring 1,560 new aircraft such as the 787, 777 and 777X.  This year's forecast reflects a continued shift from very large jets to efficient new small and medium widebody airliners. China's single-aisle fleet currently accounts for about 18 percent of global single-aisle aircraft; however, China's widebody fleet only represents approximately 5 percent of the global widebody segment. "The continuing expansion of China's middle class, coupled with new visa policies and a wide range of widebody airplanes with new technologies, capabilities and efficiencies, gives us every reason to expect a very bright future for China's long-haul market," said Tinseth. Driven by China's growing e-commerce business – already the largest in the world – air cargo is expected to become a key driver for the continuous growth of aviation in China, with the need for 180 new freighters and 410 converted freighters. Worldwide, Boeing projects a larger demand for 39,620 new aircraft over the next 20 years in its Current Market Outlook, an increase of 4.1% over last year's forecast with annual growth of 4.8%, valuing future aircraft deliveries at $5.9 trillion. "Despite recent events that have impacted the financial markets, the aviation sector will continue to see long-term growth with the commercial fleet doubling in size," said Randy Tinseth, vice president of Marketing, Boeing Commercial Airplanes. "We expect to see passing, passenger traffic grow 4.8 percent a year over the next two decades."

About us Membership Contact us Fri November 18, 2016 Home Society Economy Politics Sports Culture Multimedia U.S. approves export of Boeing, Airbus planes to Iran Economy September 23, 2016 The U.S. Treasury Department has granted permission to Boeing and Airbus to export commercial planes to Iran, a Treasury spokesperson told NPR. The government has approved a deal — not yet finalized — for Boeing to sell IranAir 80 commercial passenger aircraft. Thumbs-up from the Treasury is a major step forward on a key portion of last year's deal between Iran and six world powers including the U.S., in which Iran agreed to curb its nuclear program in exchange for relief from decades-long sanctions. That relief officially started in January, as we reported. "These licenses contain strict conditions to ensure that the planes will be used exclusively for commercial passenger use and cannot be resold or transferred to a designated entity," the Treasury spokesperson said. Boeing and Iran reached a $20 billion provisional agreement in late June for 80 aircraft, as NPR's Jackie Northam reported. Since then, the Treasury has "spent months scrutinizing the deal to see what technology will be used on the planes, and whether anyone remaining on a U.S. sanctions list is involved in the deal," Jackie said. She added that this marks the first time that Boeing has sold planes to Iran since its 1979 revolution. Jackie reports, "There is ferocious competition between Boeing and Airbus, and a good chance Boeing would be locked out of the Iranian market for decades if it didn't get this approval." The new aircraft are a major step toward modernizing and expanding "the country's elderly fleet", as Reuters reported. The Treasury also granted Boeing's competitor Airbus a license to sell 17 aircraft to IranAir, as Jackie reported. "Even though Airbus is based in Europe, it needs U.S. approval because its planes contain sophisticated technological equipment made in America. That includes the computers and navigational equipment." Both companies received the green light to sell a mix of wide-body and single aisle jets, Jackie said. She has reported that this deal is seen as an important test case for doing business with Iran, including big questions on financing: "Commercial aircraft are one of the very few products U.S. companies are allowed to sell to Iran. Even so, a deal has to be done without using American dollars or the U.S. financial system. This creates a problem even for international companies wanting to sell to Iran because most foreign banks have partnerships with American banks. "Former Treasury official Elizabeth Rosenberg says that's why all eyes are on Boeing to see if it can find innovative ways to pick through this financial minefield." The deals are also likely to "test conservative opposition" to the nuclear agreement in both the U.S. and Iran, as Reuters reported. In the U.S., many Republican lawmakers are against selling Iran planes, as are some conservatives in Iran.

Tweet Change text size for the story Print Report an error Big moves are afoot on the federal military procurement file – and not a moment too soon. Of the dizzying array of rusted-out Canadian Forces gear that must be replaced with varying degrees of urgency, two big-ticket items have dominated; new ships for the Royal Canadian Navy and Coast Guard, and new fighters for the Royal Canadian Air Force. On both fronts, according to a senior defence industry source, the Liberal government is gearing up for moves it hopes will break the logjam. “They’re now where the former government was in June of 2015,” said the source. “Basically there’s a realization that what they’ve been doing isn’t working.” A procurement workforce that lost a huge amount of capacity during the 1990s grew only marginally during the 2000s, and was then hammered by Harper’s attempts to balance the books. At the same time, longstanding problems defining and communicating military requirements and costing projects persisted, and new, more onerous policies regarding investment planning and managing major projects were introduced, which meant that procuring military equipment took more time and effort. On tap are an open, international competition for the new fighter jet, nominally including the controversial F-35 despite the Liberal campaign pledge to rule it out, and a re-apportioning of some of the furthest-off planned naval and Coast Guard shipbuilding, perhaps to a contractor or contractors overseas. Both moves are long overdue. The selection and purchase of a jet to replace the 1980s-vintage Boeing CF-18s has been stalled since the former Conservative government’s sole-sourced purchase of 65 Lockheed-Martin F-35s went awry in late 2012, due to concerns over ballooning life-cycle costs, and the lack of an open competition. During last year’s federal campaign the Liberals pledged to scrap the F-35 deal once and for all, buy a less costly plane and re-apportion any savings to shipbuilding. There was speculation last spring that a purchase of Boeing Super Hornets was in the offing, which quickly sputtered after the Liberals were accused by the opposition of seeking to engineer their own sole-sourced fighter purchase. Meantime, at the Irving yard on the East Coast and Seaspan’s shipyard in Vancouver, work continues on a series of Arctic patrol boats and small Coast Guard vessels, respectively. Construction of a new fleet of naval frigates, two mammoth naval supply ships and a large three-season icebreaker for the Coast Guard is still some years off, given current building schedules. In a recent interview, Jonathan Whitworth, Seaspan’s chief executive, said the first of four smaller vessels for the Coast Guard is on target to be completed next year, with two more coming in 2018. He said he was unable to provide a schedule for completion of any further planned work by Seaspan, including the two supply ships and the three-season icebreaker, all much larger than anything the company has built to date. Whitworth referred questions about Seaspan’s longer-term federal work to a pending federal procurement review, which he said he expects to see by year-end. In the early going of the Trudeau government indications were that, beyond finding a new fighter (anything other than the F-35 to fulfill their election promise) not much would change on the procurement front, particularly with respect to the National Shipbuilding Procurement Strategy unveiled by the Tories in the fall of 2011. The waters were further muddied by the accession of Dominic LeBlanc, a member of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s inner circle, to the post of Fisheries Minister, nominally responsible for the Coast Guard. LeBlanc, because of personal ties to the Irving family, has recused himself from dealings with federal shipbuilding. Industry insiders have expected the absence of an active minister’s hand on the Coast Guard rebuild would further slow decision-making. But the cabinet defence procurement committee, chaired by Natural Resources Minister Jim Carr, has apparently come around to the view that the status quo will not stand. It may have been spurred in this by numerous reports, including one last week from the Commons defence committee chaired by Liberal MP Stephen Fuhr, raising alarms about the rapid buildup of Russian military power in the Arctic. An open competition for the fighter jet procurement would necessarily include the F-35. But the statement of requirements, which likely will not be finalized until after the defence review currently under way is complete, may de facto preclude one plane, or several. The perennial likely competitors include Boeing’s Super Hornet, Dassault’s Rafale, The Eurofighter Typhoon and Saab’s Grippen, as well as the F-35. The timing of any aircraft rollout will be of the essence: The 77 CF-18s now flying are being refurbished to extend their lives to 2025. But that date is a hard cap, because of life-cycle expiry of the air frames. On the shipping side, the emerging thinking is that the current amorphous delivery timeline on the two supply ships and three-season icebreaker is too far off to be acceptable. Seaspan is deemed to have its hands full now with the four smaller Coast Guard vessels that are first in line to be built. A similar view was reached by senior figures in the former Conservative government, before it fell. Should part or all of the supply-ship and large-icebreaker work go elsewhere, the Western shipyard would likely be given an additional round of contracts on smaller Coast Guard cutters, which also will need to be replaced in the medium term, the senior industry source suggested.

Opinion 0 0 0 September 25, 2016 The Human Mission To Mars In The New NASA Budget: Onward To The Red Planet Or Just A Giveaway To The Aerospace Industry? Daniel Ketchum The following article is entirely the opinion of Daniel Ketchum and does not reflect the views of the Inquisitr. For fans of America’s space program, the news from Universe Today that the Senate has just passed a NASA fiscal year spending bill of $19.5 billion and that the principal focus is a human mission to Mars might seem like reason for celebration. But is this new budget really written to support exploration or is it designed to prop up the old, traditional aerospace industry at the expense of upstarts like SpaceX or Blue Origin? 3 new #astronomy posts about #orion #mars https://t.co/J1fnky7DMs — Topicly Astronomy (@topiclyastro) September 23, 2016 It’s not unreasonable to ask this question. For four decades now, the path that the Senate and Congress have laid out for NASA has been one where the concept of exploration has been shoved aside for other goals. The Space Shuttle and the International Space Station have provided enormous financial benefits for companies like Boeing and Lockheed, but they haven’t moved the human race one step further in the exploration of space. But they have consumed a sizable chunk of NASA’s budget. Neil Armstrong misquoted? His accent could've been to blame for us mishearing the moon landing speech https://t.co/mpw5uV5uty via @IBTimesUK — Rachel Middleton (@NewswithRachel) September 8, 2016 In less than 10 years in the 1960s, the United States went from having virtually no space program whatsoever to landing human beings on the surface of the moon. Although several Apollo missions followed the pioneering journey of Apollo 11, politicians in Washington largely lost interest in the space program once it was no longer useful as a propaganda tool in the Cold War. In the euphoria of the landing on the moon in 1969, many people felt there would be a human mission to Mars within a decade or so. But with the Shuttle and the International Space Station, the United States has done nothing but circle around the Earth thousands of times. Instead of exploring and colonizing another world, NASA has tried to make meaningless experiments in zero gravity seem important. The lone American astronaut in orbit may have to cast her presidential vote from the International Space Station: https://t.co/mtXuFgXSOp — Kyle Griffin (@kylegriffin1) September 25, 2016 But just why have we maintained NASA’s massive and extremely expensive infrastructure for such pointless experimentation in low Earth orbit? If it wasn’t to prepare for a human mission to Mars, what exactly was the purpose? A careful look at the way NASA contracts are doled out to the aerospace industry and how NASA facilities are spread across the country provides a clue to the answer to these questions. In short, for the last 40 years, NASA has served as corporate welfare to help maintain aerospace companies like Boeing, Lockheed, and Hughes. The space shuttle Atlantis rolls down Kennedy Parkway on its way to its new home at the Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex. [Image by Bill Ingalls/NASA via Getty image] Indirectly, NASA is providing funding to help maintain these companies so that the military can then benefit from their expertise in their own projects. But the principal reason for this largesse on the part of the United States government – and the Senate and Congress in particular – is that all of these major corporations provide jobs to their constituencies. And this is the reason – there is no logical rationale otherwise – for why NASA’s space missions are distributed far and wide across the United States. Rockets are tested in Alabama, launched from Florida and managed from Texas. As SpaceX has made clear with its own consolidation of its operations, the only reason to scatter these activities like this is political gain. Certainly, efficiency can’t be what they have in mind. Elon Musk and Buzz Lightyear, same ethos. https://t.co/eRT500GeAl — Ars Technica (@arstechnica) September 25, 2016 Speaking of SpaceX and the possibility of a human mission to Mars, it seems highly probable that long before the extremely vague 2030s date that NASA keeps putting forward for its own mission to Mars, Elon Musk will have already sent human beings to the red planet. Yes, Musk and his pioneering space company did suffer a recent setback due to a rocket explosion. But the benefit of being a private company instead of a governmental agency is that he can simply find the problem, solve it, and move forward. Every time NASA suffers a setback, the political figures – who often helped to create the problem to begin with – leap in to blame NASA and redirect the agency on yet another new course correction.

It seems clear it is designed to prop up obsolete aerospace companies in the face of stiff competition from SpaceX and others.

Skip to navigation Skip to content Skip to sidebar News National More Michael Den Tandt: Liberal government mulling long-overdue moves on military procurement file Michael Den Tandt  09.25.2016 A partially built Arctic Offshore Patrol Ship at Irving Shipbuilding's Halifax Shipyard. ShareAdjustCommentPrint Big moves are afoot on the federal military procurement file – and not a moment too soon. Of the dizzying array of rusted-out Canadian Forces gear that must be replaced with varying degrees of urgency, two big-ticket items have dominated; new ships for the Royal Canadian Navy and Coast Guard, and new fighters for the Royal Canadian Air Force. On both fronts, according to a senior defence industry source, the Liberal government is gearing up for moves it hopes will break the logjam. “They’re now where the former government was in June of 2015,” said the source. “Basically there’s a realization that what they’ve been doing isn’t working.” On tap are an open, international competition for the new fighter jet, nominally including the controversial F-35 despite the Liberal campaign pledge to rule it out, and a re-apportioning of some of the furthest-off planned naval and Coast Guard shipbuilding, perhaps to a contractor or contractors overseas. Both moves are long overdue. The selection and purchase of a jet to replace the 1980s-vintage Boeing CF-18s has been stalled since the former Conservative government’s sole-sourced purchase of 65 Lockheed-Martin F-35s went awry in late 2012, due to concerns over ballooning life-cycle costs, and the lack of an open competition. During last year’s federal campaign the Liberals pledged to scrap the F-35 deal once and for all, buy a less costly plane and re-apportion any savings to shipbuilding. There was speculation last spring that a purchase of Boeing Super Hornets was in the offing, which quickly sputtered after the Liberals were accused by the opposition of seeking to engineer their own sole-sourced fighter purchase. Meantime, at the Irving yard on the East Coast and Seaspan’s shipyard in Vancouver, work continues on a series of Arctic patrol boats and small Coast Guard vessels, respectively. Construction of a new fleet of naval frigates, two mammoth naval supply ships and a large three-season icebreaker for the Coast Guard is still some years off, given current building schedules. In a recent interview, Jonathan Whitworth, Seaspan’s chief executive, said the first of four smaller vessels for the Coast Guard is on target to be completed next year, with two more coming in 2018. He said he was unable to provide a schedule for completion of any further planned work by Seaspan, including the two supply ships and the three-season icebreaker, all much larger than anything the company has built to date. Whitworth referred questions about Seaspan’s longer-term federal work to a pending federal procurement review, which he said he expects to see by year-end. In the early going of the Trudeau government indications were that, beyond finding a new fighter (anything other than the F-35 to fulfill their election promise) not much would change on the procurement front, particularly with respect to the National Shipbuilding Procurement Strategy unveiled by the Tories in the fall of 2011. The waters were further muddied by the accession of Dominic LeBlanc, a member of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s inner circle, to the post of Fisheries Minister, nominally responsible for the Coast Guard. LeBlanc, because of personal ties to the Irving family, has recused himself from dealings with federal shipbuilding. Industry insiders have expected the absence of an active minister’s hand on the Coast Guard rebuild would further slow decision-making. But the cabinet defence procurement committee, chaired by Natural Resources Minister Jim Carr, has apparently come around to the view that the status quo will not stand. It may have been spurred in this by numerous reports, including one last week from the Commons defence committee chaired by Liberal MP Stephen Fuhr, raising alarms about the rapid buildup of Russian military power in the Arctic. An open competition for the fighter jet procurement would necessarily include the F-35. But the statement of requirements, which likely will not be finalized until after the defence review currently under way is complete, may de facto preclude one plane, or several. The perennial likely competitors include Boeing’s Super Hornet, Dassault’s Rafale, The Eurofighter Typhoon and Saab’s Grippen, as well as the F-35. The timing of any aircraft rollout will be of the essence: The 77 CF-18s now flying are being refurbished to extend their lives to 2025. But that date is a hard cap, because of life-cycle expiry of the air frames. On the shipping side, the emerging thinking is that the current amorphous delivery timeline on the two supply ships and three-season icebreaker is too far off to be acceptable. Seaspan is deemed to have its hands full now with the four smaller Coast Guard vessels that are first in line to be built. A similar view was reached by senior figures in the former Conservative government, before it fell. Should part or all of the supply-ship and large-icebreaker work go elsewhere, the Western shipyard would likely be given an additional round of contracts on smaller Coast Guard cutters, which also will need to be replaced in the medium term, the senior industry source suggested. • Twitter: @mdentandt Comments We encourage all readers to share their views on our articles and blog posts.

Blog Long-Living Products Defy Conventional Wisdom Bill Schweber, Engineer, Author, Editor 9/25/2016 09:00 AM EDT  23 comments   post a comment NO RATINGS Login to Rate Tweet Winning products can have viable production lifetimes of decades, despite our "here today, obsolete tomorrow" thinking. In the fast-cycle world of modern consumer electronics, many people assume that all products have short market lifetimes. Sure, there may be some folks who hang on and make do with those "old" devices, such as a PC or cell phone more than a few years old, but that model is certainly not being manufactured anymore, as it has been replaced by a newer, better, shinier model. Maybe that's the case for many items, but not for all. Two recent examples show us that a good product can continue to be manufactured for decades and more. Keysight Technologies, (formerly Agilent Technologies, and Hewlett-Packard before that), recently announced the end of manufacturing and availability of their classic model 34401A digital multimeter. Introduced in 1992, this DMM (Figure 1) has been used extensively on the test bench, in the field, in production test, and many other places. It's been so popular that Keysight produced the "Avoid the 34401A Apocalypse" Webcast to help those having 34401A "withdrawal" issues, to guide them on a smooth transition to its replacement unit, the 34461A (and note that they gave advance notice that this product was nearing its end back in 2013, see "Replacing a Workhorse"). Figure 1. The legendary Hewlett-Packard 34401A Digital Multimeter, subsequently rebranded as Agilent and then Keysight, is being discontinued 24 years after its introduction. On a much, much larger scale, The Wall Street Journal reported that Boeing said it might discontinue manufacture of the venerable 747 widebody jet this year or next, due to declining orders, "Boeing Considers Ending Production of 747". That classic aircraft was introduced in the late 1960s and they have sold over 1500 since then; they have "only" 21 orders for it at this point. You might assume that the sales history of this plane follows the usual trajectory of ramping up after introduction and widespread adoption, peaking, and then drifting down, but that's not the case. The Boeing-supplied data (Figure 2), shows the cyclical nature of its orders, which is unlike what we usually see for all-electronic products. Figure 2. The sales of the Boeing 747, introduced in the late 1960s, have not followed the classic simple rise, peak, and decline shape of most products (data from Boeing, image from The Wall Street Journal). Of course, an aircraft is not the same as a DMM. While there undoubtedly have been updates and upgrades to the 34401A, they certainly can't have been as extensive as those for the 747. Can you imagine the volume of ECOs (engineering change orders) on an aircraft such as this? The reality is that the experience gained during volume production and intensive operation over time contributes immensely to manufacturing efficiency, better flight performance, enhanced reliability, and fewer surprises. Today's 747 has many upgrades in airframe, engines, avionics, and more. For example, the now-standard FOG (fiber-optic gyro) for inertial navigation was only in its infancy in the 1970s, and supplemental GPS is now also installed (navigating on GPS alone is not a good idea, for many reasons). Still, many for the basic components are likely barely changed from the original, so tooling costs have certainly been amortized. This long-lived scenario applies to ICs, as well. Analog Devices manufactured, sold, and supported the AD574 12-bit A/D converter for more than 25 years, even re-designing the die for better performance and lower cost, and introducing new packages as well. If you wonder "why," the answer is simple: customers asked for it. In the analog world especially, once you have a part designed in, working, and its unavoidable idiosyncrasies understood and tamed, there's a great reluctance to change it. Other IC vendors have similar tales to tell about some of their winning products. Of course, keeping an IC alive and in production for years is far easier than doing so for a complex assembled product such as a DMM, or an aircraft with its BOM (bill of materials) that has millions of distinct parts and thousands of subassemblies. But it's important to keep in mind that the conventional wisdom that a product will be out of production after a few years may be incorrect, especially for the more technically sophisticated ones. That also means that the suppliers of the constituent components and materials need to keep their own production lines running, as even the simplest assembled product has many items on its BOM.

I think one key is to pick the popular products - yes, the 74xx mainstays are still in production, but a lot of the less popular, more exotic ones are probably hard to find.  The 8086 had a longer life than the 80286 - I wouldn't be surprised if it's still in production, somewhere.

Kantipur The Kathmandu Post saptahik Nepal Nari Radio Kantipur Kantipur TV 0Shares Share on facebookShare on twitter Money NAC board okays plan to procure 2 wide-body jets - SANGAM PRASAIN, Kathmandu The national flag bearer plans to add the first of the two proposed jets by Sept and another six months later Sep 25, 2016- The board of Nepal Airlines Corporation (NAC) on Saturday unanimously approved its management’s plan to procure two Airbus A330-200 wide-body jets. The decision paves the way for the national flag carrier to formally begin the procurement process to induct first-ever long-range wide-body Airbus jets into its fleet. Under the Rs25-billion fleet expansion project, the state-owned airline plans to add the first of the two proposed jets by September 2017 and another six months later. “Saturday’s board has allowed the NAC management to begin the procurement process. And, it is all prepared for it,” said Buddhi Sagar Lamichhane, joint secretary of the Tourism Ministry, who also sits on the NAC board. “The board was unanimous regarding the induction of the Airbus jets into the fleet.” The board’s move to allow NAC to buy the jets from the European aviation giant follows the management’s recommendation to switch to Airbus from Boeing as pursuing a one-family aircraft strategy would reduce maintenance and crew training costs. NAC plans to have an all-Airbus fleet in the near future. The management has already decided to phase out one of its two Boeing 757s. Currently, NAC flies five different types of aircraft—Boeing, Airbus, Twin Otter, MA60 and Y12e. Due to the diverse fleet, it needs to have different sets of pilots, engineers and spare parts. NAC purchased two Airbus A320-200 aircraft last year by borrowing Rs10 billion from the Employees Provident Fund in its first fleet expansion in 27 years. This time too, it plans to request the Employees Provident Fund and Citizen Investment Trust for loans. Two weeks ago, the Finance Ministry had agreed to act as a guarantor on the loan NAC plans to take. Last January, the national flag carrier had unveiled an ambitious reform strategy that includes buying two wide-body aircraft over the next two years. The NAC board had agreed in principle to the corporation’s proposal. The Airbus A330-200 aircraft can accommodate up to 280 passengers in a two-class layout. The carrier has proposed procuring the long-range jets to serve destinations in North America, Japan, Australia and the UK as they have been identified as prospective markets for Nepal over the next 20 years. In 2015, NAC’s market share on international routes stood at 7.88 percent, up from 5.87 percent in 2014. Nepal Airlines saw the strongest passenger growth after it added two A320 aircraft to its fleet. The beleaguered national flag carrier flew 253,658 travellers last year, up 22.87 percent compared to the previous year. During its heyday, NAC used to fly to Amsterdam, Colombo, Dhaka, Frankfurt, Karachi, London, Osaka, Paris, Shanghai, Singapore and Vienna besides five Indian cities-Bangalore, Delhi, Kolkata, Mumbai and Patna. It presently connects Kathmandu with Doha, Kuala Lumpur, Hong Kong, Bangkok, Delhi and Bangalore. The carrier currently serves eight international destinations, including three Indian cities, and plans to expand to Guangzhou, China, by this year.

A Department of Defense release said the Boeing, the weapon manufacturer, is being awarded the $81,271,024 contract for firm-fixed-price modification to a previously awarded firm-fixed-price contract to exercise an option for the procurement of 22 Lot 89 Harpoon missiles and associated containers and components for India under the Foreign Military Sales programme. The contract is expected to be completed in June 2018. In 2014, India requested the US government for the Harpoon missiles for Shishumar class submarine. The request was made under Foreign Military Sale. The US Defence Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) had July 2014 said that the Indian government has requested a possible sale of 12 UGM-84L Harpoon Block II Encapsulated Missiles, 10 UTM-84L Harpoon Encapsulated Training missiles, 2 Encapsulated Harpoon certification training vehicles, containers, spare and repair parts, support and test equipment, personnel training and training equipment, publications and technical data, US Government and contractor engineering and logistics support services, and other related elements of logistics support. The estimated cost is $200 million. It said that this weapon system, to be employed on the Shishumar class submarine (Type-209), will provide enhanced capabilities for defence of critical sea lines of communication. "India has already purchased Harpoon missiles for integration on Indian Air Force's Jaguar aircraft and Indian Navy's P-8I maritime patrol aircraft. India will have no difficulty absorbing these additional missiles into its armed forces," it added. Sources in the industry said that a contract was signed this June between Indian Ministry of Defence and US Department of Defense for supply of Harpoon systems for the submarines. To execute this contract, the US government has to buy the missiles from Boeing to supply to India. --IANS rs/vd SEARCH More from Sify: talking point on sify news Latest Features In pictures: Israeli President in India, says 'thank you' '50 days' : PM Modi's gift to Children!

First flight took place on 27 June, Don Bolling, director of business development in the company's Missiles and Fire Control division, said at the Air Force Association's (AFA's) annual conference. The company has since conducted 15 hours of flight testing aboard an F-15C at Jacksonville Air National Guard Base in Florida and is ready to reply to a US Air Force (USAF) request for proposals (RfP) for the acquisition, expected by the end of the year. Legion Pod can house various sensors, but in this application the company fitted its IRST21, a new generation of Lockheed Martin's legacy IRST sensor. The company describes IRST21 as "a passive, long-range sensor system" that uses IRST technology to detect and track airborne threats. Similar to last year's F-16 flight tests, the system successfully tracked multiple airborne targets in representative scenarios, according to Lockheed Martin. The company hopes its Legion Pod can meet a USAF requirement to fit its Boeing F-15C Eagle fighter aircraft with the IRST capability. The IRST21 design allows for mounting in various ways. Boeing F/A-18E/F Super Hornet fighters mount IRST21, designated as AN/ASG-34, on the nose section of the centreline fuel tank, while the Legion Pod variant is being developed to be transportable across a wide range of platforms including the F-15C and F-16.

The company sees demand for its superjumbo growing in the long term. Wang Zhao / AFP A380 has bright future despite production cutbacks, insists Airbus Agencies September 24, 2016 Updated: September 24, 2016 05:36 PM Related Airbus takes chopper to hundreds of jobs at its helicopter business Malaysia Airlines in talks to rent out A380s for Haj and Umrah pilgrim flights Dozens of Boeing and Airbus deliveries put back by Turkish Airlines Airbus brings jets, spacecraft, helicopters and missiles under one roof Dubai International Airport to have most A380-capable gates in the world Topics: Airbus Airbus has dismissed doubts over demand for the world’s largest passenger plane, the double-decker A380, even after it lowered production targets in July. "Every 15 years, the industry is doubling in size,"said the chief operating officer for customers, John Leahy. "So here you have London Heathrow, totally congested. JFK, congested. Los Angeles, congested. Hong Kong, congested. How are we going to double the traffic flows in the next 15 years if we don’t use larger aircraft like the A380?" Despite that longer-term optimism, Airbus now is lacking in new orders for the A380. In 2018, the company plans to cut the A380’s delivery target to 12 a year from 27 in 2015 and about half what is projected for this year, to prevent a glut of unsold planes. Singapore Airlines Ltd said this month it will not extend a lease on one of aircraft. The France-based aircraft maker is also confident in plans from engine maker Pratt & Whitney to solve production delays for its next-generation single-aisle planes, the A320neo, Mr Leahy said. "It is disappointing the situation we find ourselves in. But it’s a good engine for everything we can see. They have some production difficulties that they’re working their way through," Leahy told reporters in New York after a gathering of aviation executives and analysts known as the Wings Club. United Technologies Corp said earlier this month it would deliver 150 of its Pratt & Whitney engines this year, missing its target of 200 and pressuring cash flow. Mr Leahy’s upbeat comments came as the US government and Boeing claimed victory in a dispute with the EU, claiming the Euopean manufacturer gained huge advantages from subsidies. The European Union failed to eliminate subsidies to Airbus that were previously found to violate trade rules, the World Trade Organisation said in a ruling that opens the door to billions of dollars in sanctions against Brussels. The finding by a WTO compliance panel strikes a blow to the EU in a long-running dispute with the United States over government subsidies to the world’s two largest aircraft manufacturers, Airbus and Boeing The US had said it would seek US$10 billion in sanctions if the EU did not remedy illegal financing, which the trade body found in a 2011 ruling had cost Boeing plane sales and market share. The Geneva-based WTO cannot force nations or companies to drop payments that violate trade rules, but it can authorise retaliatory measures to pressure governments into complying with its rulings. The EU can still appeal the latest decision. If it loses, the US can seek sanctions. Separate cases involving assistance for Boeing remain under consideration. "This report is a sweeping victory for the United States and its aerospace workers," U.S. Trade Representative Michael Froman said in a statement. "We have long maintained that EU aircraft subsidies have cost American companies tens of billions of dollars in lost revenue, which this report clearly proves." The WTO panel said EU member states have failed to adequately remedy $18bn in launch aid for Airbus’ A380 superjumbo and other jets, infrastructure support and equity investments that the trade body determined in 2011 had unfairly benefited the plane maker. The ruling also cited additional subsidies not mentioned in that decision five years ago: more than $4bn in launch aid for Airbus’ new A350 wide-body jet. In a separate case, the trade organisation is still determining whether Boeing and the US have adequately addressed $5.3bn in illegal aid that flowed to the Chicago-based planemaker. The EU has filed another case challenging $8.7bn in subsidies granted by the state of Washington in 2013 in exchange for a Boeing pledge to manufacture its 777X jet in the Puget Sound region. business@thenational.ae Follow us on Twitter @TheNationalPF Pages: Add your comment View all comments Related Airbus takes chopper to hundreds of jobs at its helicopter business Malaysia Airlines in talks to rent out A380s for Haj and Umrah pilgrim flights Dozens of Boeing and Airbus deliveries put back by Turkish Airlines Airbus brings jets, spacecraft, helicopters and missiles under one roof More Aviation Supercars can now travel in style from Dubai with Emirates Skywheels US regional airline Republic set to fly out of bankruptcy soon Bombardier’s passenger jet woes spur high-cost refinancing Brazil approves Qatar Airways’ stake purchase in Chile-based Latam Airlines MOST VIEWED Business | All Standard Chartered cuts 150 jobs in the UAE, may lay off more by year-end Egypt to cut energy subsidies further after securing IMF loan What happens if Dubai tenant stays in property without signing new contract on expiry?

Sep 23, 2016 Henry Canaday | ATW Plus EMAIL Tweet Comments 0 Moving Faster Farnborough International Advertisement Aircraft maintenance usually slows during the traffic peak of summer, but maintenance news was plentiful in July at Farnborough. At times, the airshow looked like a maintenance conference, so fast did the aftermarket press releases fly. Maybe that is appropriate. Commercial aircraft maintenance is now a $66-billion-a year business, and it is changing just as fast as new aircraft. Airframe, engine and component OEMs continue to increase their roles in maintenance, or asset management, as it is now called because of the wider responsibilities for pools and parts suppliers take on. The much-discussed move to predictive maintenance through more data and smarter analytics is picking up real momentum as more firms compete to do the job. Other innovations such as inspections by robots and unmanned aircraft and additively manufactured repairs are beginning to happen, though without much economic impact so far. What does it all mean for airlines? OEMs say they are designing more durable, less maintenance-hungry equipment and their flight-hour programs will save airlines money. But evidence is mixed so far. Start with the OEMs. GE Aviation was busy at Farnborough, bringing 1,400 Southwest Airlines CFM56s, 28 more Turkish Airlines CF6s, Emirates’ 54 GE90s, TUI’s GEnxs, Austrian Airlines’ 10 GE90s, Thomas Cook’s CF6s and EgyptAir under various TrueChoice agreements, the engine-maker’s new, flexible program for providing support, provided the right parts are used. CFM International finalized a 12-year services agreement with LATAM Airlines Group for 35 CFM56s. Air Canada signed a services agreement with Pratt & Whitney for maintenance of PW1500Gs on 45 to 75 Bombardier CSeries aircraft for 15 years. Even for the aircraft manufacturers, the bigger news was on the maintenance side. Boeing got the largest service contract in its history when Norwegian Air agreed to put up to 200 737 MAXs, plus its 787s, under GoldCare. Airbus’s Satair Group will provide Integrated Material Services on 15,000 part numbers for Cathay Pacific Airways’ 48 A350 XWBs, while Azul Brazilian Airlines signed a 12-year contract with Airbus for flight-hour component support on A320s. Bombardier’s Smart Parts program will support components of airBaltic’s 20 CSeries aircraft for at least the first five years of operation. And ATR joined its fellow regional aircraft OEMs by announcing it will also go into the maintenance business, although not in too big a way at first. Mitsubishi Aircraft Corp. has already started to name its preferred maintenance providers for the MRJ. And component manufacturer UTC Aerospace signed Asiana Airlines and Copa Airlines up for landing gear and AirAsia for nacelle support. Outsourcing of maintenance and asset management is not confined to OEMs, or at least OEMs alone. Lufthansa Technik uses its airline buying power, maintenance expertise and logistics network to partner with OEMs for many customers. It has signed new long-term agreements for maintenance on GE9Xs and GEnxs, will become a member of Pratt & Whitney’s Geared Turbofan maintenance network, and will do mobile maintenance on several Pratt engines. LHT is now opening a new warehouse for components on A320s and A330s at London Heathrow. AFI-KLM E&M will support Thai Airways components on A350s. Partnerships in maintenance sometimes lead to complete mergers, some successful others not. It should not be surprising that the organization of the aftermarket continually shifts. In 2016, ST Aerospace shed half its equity stake in aircraft lessor Keystone Holdings, and SIA Engineering Company shed its smaller shares in Hong Kong Aero Engine Services and Singapore Aero Engine Services. Rolls-Royce took complete control of Spain’s engine maintenance and manufacturing company ITP. Rolls and Mubadala Development Co. are planning a maintenance and manufacturing center in the Emirates, and Mubadala is selling 80% of its stake in SR Technics to China’s HNA Aviation. $40 oil has consequences. Big data Part of the OEM pitch for flight-hour deals is that they know their products, and part is that they can gather more fleet-wide data and interpret it better than anyone else. Here too, GE is being aggressive. It is building on its expertise in aircraft and other engines to develop Predix, a cloud platform for gathering and analyzing engine and any other data airlines may choose to collect. By August, data on 35,000 engines and more than a hundred apps were running on the new system. Other OEMs are joining the Big Data evolution, though in different ways. Boeing announced it will provide six customers with advanced analytics on more than 500 aircraft. And perhaps looking toward even more ambitious data-crunching, Boeing and IT giant IBM have partnered to build a new platform, to run on Microsoft’s Azure cloud, for commercial aviation analytics. Airbus has enhanced its AIRMAN system with an Expert module to help airline staff troubleshoot inflight problems and has developed a new tool, Prognostics and Risk Management, to analyze trends that could indicate problems ahead. It too is working with IBM’s data scientists.  Regional aircraft OEMs are on the same path. The new Embraer E-Jets and Bombardier’s CSeries will generate significantly more performance data than their predecessors. Oliver Wyman consultants predict that commercial aircraft will be generating 98 exabytes of data by 2026. They note OEMs are ahead in interpreting all this data, and urge airlines to concentrate on high-return analytic projects.  Most of these efforts will exploit the increasingly rich data generated and partially analyzed onboard by each new generation of aircraft. For older aircraft with less abundant data capabilities, UTC Aerospace Systems is introducing Pulse, an aircraft health management system that can exploit older sensors, get the data off aircraft and analyze it for airlines or simply pass it on for airline analysis. Related to, but different from data analytics, is the continued push to modernize maintenance management systems. Mxi Technologies’ Maintenix seems to be snagging the biggest fleets recently, but Commsoft, AMOS and a host of other, sometimes specialized applications are also gaining new customers. The aftermarket is steadily moving toward digitizing as much of its administrative, execution, planning and trading activities as is practical and affordable. Short-term, digitization saves clerical efforts, time and errors. Long-term, it leads to smarter maintenance.  NextGen avionics installations are another multi-billion dollar retrofit activity. Aircraft connectivity is also a major retrofit drive, as carriers see revenue benefits in cabin connectivity and operating benefits in cockpit links. Geographically, Chinese and Asian MROs are seeing the most growth, reflecting faster traffic growth. But the Middle East is starting to flourish as well, with joint ventures between regional and global MROs underway, in development or planned. And Eastern Europe and Russia are the homes of some very busy young firms like Magnetic MRO and Volga-Dnepr. Robots at work Technical innovations are picking up speed. Unmanned aircraft and robots will soon do fuselage inspections better and more safely than humans on 20-foot scaffolds. OEMs have long printed plastic parts for aircraft interiors, but airlines and MROs are now starting to print plastic trays and tables rather than wait for sluggish deliveries. 3D metal printing is tougher, but engine OEMs are now doing it, and aftermarket printing may not lag far behind. Sometime progress comes from smart low-tech. One remedy for pricy OEM replacement parts has been a burgeoning trade in used but serviceable parts, 12% of part sales in 2013 and growing at 5.6% a year, according to ICF International. Dealers in these money-savers have been acquiring or setting up their own tear-down facilities to keep supplies flowing. But OEMs are also moving aggressively into the used-part market, seeking to regain control of aftermarket pricing.  What has all this change in maintenance performance, technology, organization, analytics and digitization, and scrapping bought airlines so far? It depends on what data are used. US carriers cut maintenance cost per flight hour dramatically in the four years after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, about 23% in constant dollars. That makes sense as airlines shed old, maintenance-hungry jets, outsourced heavy work and put severe pressure on in-house shops.  Then flight-hour maintenance costs drifted up, nearly reaching their 2001 levels by 2013. Easing up on labor austerity, doing deferred maintenance and newer jets getting a little older might explain that. But in the past two years, unit MRO costs have come down again. Are these savings solely because of to new-gen aircraft, or are more durable cost-saving moves beginning to pay off? Very limited data on global maintenance costs tell a slightly different story. IATA has consistent data on direct maintenance spending of 23 airlines from 2010 to 2014. The association reports that direct maintenance cost per flight hour increased 12% in nominal terms over these four years, which works out to 4% in real terms over a span in which US costs were essentially flat.   These are both crude comparisons. They ignore changes in aircraft age and size, average stage length and other factors. They do not count gains that might be purchased by more maintenance spending, such as improved reliability and better fuel efficiency. And a focus on MRO spending ignores the possibility that OEMs might be discounting initial sales to lock in long-term support deals.  Print reprints Favorite EMAIL Tweet Please Log In or Register to post comments.

The Green Island factory and a sister plant in South Bend, Indiana, make braking systems and wheels for commercial and military aircraft, including the Boeing 737, the Boeing B-52 and F/A-18 and Lockheed Martin F-35. Today’s action was in direct response to the Department of Defense’s recent announcement that it was awarding Honeywell in South Bend an $18.3 million contract for the manufacture of replacement brakes for the U.S. Navy’s F/A18. “We believe the government should stop giving new contracts or extending old contracts to a deplorable company that is locking out its workers and destroying good, middle-class jobs,” said Julie Kushner, Director of UAW Region 9A. “The men and women of our military deserve to know they are flying in planes made with parts made by skilled, high-quality union labor, not the inexperienced scab labor Honeywell has employed since May 9.” Negotiations were held last week in South Bend between the parties, with the participation of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service (FMCS). “The company arrived for bargaining with no new proposals and the ones we eventually received during the week did not move us closer to a contract,” said Tim Vogt, a 29 year Honeywell employee and President of UAW Local 1508, who was present at the negotiations in South Bend. Numerous labor leaders spoke in support of the locked out workers. “Our federal tax dollars should not be supporting a company that puts profits before people.  It is unconscionable that Honeywell Aerospace is benefiting from a multimillion dollar defense contract while locking out the dedicated men and women who possess the necessary job skills required to safely manufacture the wheel and braking systems for our military,” said Mario Cilento, President of the 2.5 million member New York State AFL-CIO. “Honeywell’s action is an outright attack on the middle class. This contract should be suspended until Honeywell acts responsibly and negotiates a fair contract with our members.” Supporters came from across the state to support the locked out workers. “We drove up from Eastern Long Island and are prepared to be arrested today to make the point that taxpayer money should not be used to line the pockets of union busters like Honeywell CEO David Cote, who put profits before the safety of our men and women in uniform, and the flying public,” said Brian Schneck, President of UAW Local 259 and a resident of Suffolk County. The 42 members of United Auto Workers Local 1508 in Green Island were locked out, along with approximately 350 members of UAW Local 9 in South Bend, after both locals rejected a final offer from Honeywell which would eliminate accessible and affordable union-negotiated health care coverage, leaving the employees at the mercy of the company, eliminate their pensions, threatening the retirement income security of hundreds of families, unlawfully subcontract out union work, eliminate cost of living increases and curtail overtime pay. Notwithstanding the union’s offer to continue to work past the expiration and continue negotiations, the company chose to lock out its skilled and experienced unionized workforce, leaving the production of vital aircraft braking systems to inexperienced and unskilled scab labor.  The union’s charge that the company has illegally locked out the workers is currently being investigated by Region 3 of the National Labor Relations Board. The UAW has offered dates for future bargaining while in South Bend and are waiting to hear from Honeywell. Local elected officials and community leaders were also in attendance and addressed the crowd. Powered by Distribution channels: Automotive Submit your press release Got News to Share?

First designed in the 1960s at the height of the cold war, the Minuteman nuclear weapons are starting to show their age, and replacement parts are difficult to find for the weapons designed in an analogue age. Also ageing are their silos, many built in the 1950s and now rusting as water seeps through the decaying concrete. Nuclear is crowding out more conventional systems that are [better suited to] the threats of today Laicie Heeley, a nuclear expert Over the next 20 years, the US Air Force will switch out the entirety of its Minuteman III fleet with an as-yet-unnamed new missile known only as the Ground Based Strategic Deterrent (GBSD). The Air Force estimates the cost of the GBSD, to be introduced late in the 2020s and phased in over the following decade, will be around US$86 billion over the missiles’ life cycle of about 50 years. Critics point to the Defence Department’s long history of projects going way over budget and say the cost of replacing the nukes and maintaining their launch facilities is not warranted, given the tactical threats the United States currently faces. The Air Force “doesn’t know how we are going to afford this,” said Laicie Heeley, a nuclear expert at the Stimson Center, a non-partisan anti-nuclear proliferation think tank in Washington. “Nuclear is crowding out more conventional systems that are [better suited to] the threats of today.” The Air Force issued requests for proposals in July for vendors to replace the Minuteman, named after colonial militiamen who eventually fought against the British in America’s Revolutionary War. The prize will likely go to one of the three US defence giants: Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman and Boeing, and the new missile will be equipped with state-of-the-art electronics while being protected from any cyber threats. America’s intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) are just one leg of its “triad” – a three-pronged nuclear attack force also comprising submarines and bombers. The Pentagon wants to replace or modernise all three legs of the triad, at a cost experts estimate will hit US$1 trillion over the next 30 years. “We flat can’t afford it. And from a priorities standpoint, it’s the wrong priority in the world that we face,” Democratic Congressman Adam Smith told a Washington forum last week, noting that the ICBM force is the part of the triad best suited for reduction. The lawmaker said countries like China are able to boast a “spectacular deterrent” with far fewer nuclear weapons. “What they have is enough to say ‘Don’t screw with us, or we will obliterate you,’” he said, adding that even if the United States were to enter a major nuclear fight, “we’re pretty much all toast anyways”. The Pentagon insists it is imperative to push ahead with a complete overhaul of America’s nuclear force. While the United States and Russia signed a treaty in 2010 to reduce the numbers of nuclear launchers, Moscow is modernising its own triad. “The Russians, the Chinese, the North Koreans are upgrading all of their systems,” an Air Force official told AFP, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the nuclear programme. “They are upgrading all of their legs of the triad – in that environment, I am not sure it makes sense” to do nothing. Another Air Force official said many of the vendors who first built or equipped the missile silos have long gone out of business, making it an arduous task to find replacement parts. He said he’d heard anecdotes of colleagues scouring Ebay or other sites looking for antique components. United States’ first ‘smart’ nuclear bomb signals new arms race with China and Russia: analysts The Minuteman fleet is currently dotted across locations in North Dakota, Wyoming and Montana. Defence Secretary Ashton Carter will on Monday visit Minot Air Force Base in North Dakota, where control centers for that state’s nukes are located. The Air Force has in recent years battled flagging morale among its “missileers” – airmen in charge of the land-based missile force. US is taking a step backwards by developing ‘smarter’ nuclear bomb A series of embarrassing revelations in 2014 described the state of the nuclear force, with dozens of airmen disciplined cheating on a test. Other investigations have probed drug use. The trouble began after the demise of the Soviet Union, as the mission gradually received a lower priority and offered a less-promising career path.   Most Popular Viewed 1 Barred Hong Kong localists vow to keep fighting after High Court decision 2 Tycoon Joseph Lau reveals details of breakup with ex-girlfriend in full-page newspaper announcement 3 China’s first female pilot of J-10 fighter jets dies in an air accident 4 Thousands turn out to decry Hong Kong independence 5 Dream of owning a home is over for most young Hong Kong people Shared 1 Barred Hong Kong localists vow to keep fighting after High Court decision 2 China’s first female pilot of J-10 fighter jets dies in an air accident 3 Tycoon Joseph Lau reveals details of breakup with ex-girlfriend in full-page newspaper announcement 4 Thousands turn out to decry Hong Kong independence 5 Syringe used to spike chocolate drink at Hong Kong convenience store Commented 1 Hong Kong localist radicals played into Beijing’s hands, democracy leader Martin Lee says 2 Hong Kong in the grip of a power struggle over oath-taking saga 3 Japan’s PM Abe has ‘great confidence’ in Trump, after president-elect’s first meeting with foreign leader 4 Hong Kong lawmaker Lau Siu-lai wins one legal challenge, but faces yet another 5 Touchdown for Chinese astronauts after record space mission Promotions Register for a free copy of XXIV 2017 now Register for a free copy of Home Essentials 2017 now       You may also like China More doubts cast over Chinese scientist’s claim of gene editing tool ‘breakthrough’ 17 Nov 2016 - 10:21pm 1 Dazzling festivals throughout December: Macau’s seasonal delights to light up the city In partnership with Macao Government Tourism Office Hong Kong Chinese government rebukes US over comments on Hong Kong removal of legislators-elect 17 Nov 2016 - 11:45pm 88 Dark Horse in Asian Air Travel Market Sponsored by: Vietnam Airlines China Trump expected to welcome Chinese investment in US, despite threatening tough tariffs on country’s products 16 Nov 2016 - 8:43am 5 Game changes in Hong Kong’s Legislative Council after ban of two localist lawmakers 17 Nov 2016 - 11:15am 67 Hong Kong Joseph Lau slams ‘greedy’ ex-girlfriend in video interview, confirms he wrote newspaper statement about breakup 16 Nov 2016 - 9:11pm 12 Hong Kong Dream of owning a home is over for most young Hong Kong people 15 Nov 2016 - 11:29pm 43 Offbeat The ‘mannequin challenge’ is the latest social media craze Nov 17th 2016, 3:37pm China Booming e-businesses amid tight censorship ... can China have it both ways with the internet? 15 Nov 2016 - 11:28pm 6 Hong Kong HK$14m revamp of Hong Kong Star Ferry looks to make waves with sofas, glass roof and diesel-electric generator 15 Nov 2016 - 10:36pm 7 Hong Kong Hong Kong’s foreign domestic helpers to be protected by new rule on window cleaning in early 2017 14 Nov 2016 - 11:50pm 10 South China Morning Post Stay connected Facebook Twitter Hong Kong Politics Economy Health & Environment Law & Crime Education & Community News China Hong Kong Asia World China Policies & Politics Diplomacy & Defence Money & Wealth Society Economy Tech Business Companies Markets Property Investor Relations Mutual Funds Economy China Economy Money & Wealth Country Reports Tech China Tech Enterprises Social & Gadgets Start-ups Apps & Gaming Innovation Leaders & Founders Science & Research E-Commerce Lifestyle Arts & Entertainment Health & Beauty Film & TV Food & Drink Families Music Fashion & Luxury Books Travel & Leisure Watches Sport Hong Kong China Golf Racing Rugby Soccer Tennis Boxing Comment Insight & Opinion Harry's View Blogs Polls Letters Multimedia Video Photos Infographics SCMP Chronicles Magazine Post Magazine Style Good Eating Destination Macau HK Magazine Archive Other Weather Most Popular 7 Days Index Country Reports Crossword Promotions Directories Luxehomes At your service Business Services Directory MICE Biz Restaurant Directory Information Buy SCMP Photos Copyright Licensing RSS Feeds SCMP.com search Historical Archive Print Subscription Advertising Opportunities Contact our Advertising Sales HK Rate card Overseas Rate Card China Rate Card The Marketer SCMP Marketing Solutions SCMP Outdoor Advertising Recruitment Advertising Events SCMP Events Operation Santa Claus Other Sites CPJobs.com Education Post Young Post Cosmopolitan CosmoGIRL!

IAG boss sees place for A380 in Iberia and Aer Lingus fleets Tropic Air delivers international flights to Chetumal View All World Routes Interview: Malaysia Airlines plans possible A380 wet-lease operation World Routes News Header World Routes Interview: Malaysia Airlines plans possible A380 wet-lease operation Share Twitter Facebook LinkedIn Google+ Email Print Comment Posted 25 September 2016 21:00 Richard Maslen Editor, Routesonline LinkedIn Twitter Follow @routesonline 5,901 followers While it might seem from the outside that nothing has changed, Malaysia Airlines has been completely reborn as a business over the last 18 months. Now, the carrier is planning a growth trajectory across south-east Asia under the stewardship of former Ryanair executive, Peter Bellew. As market conditions continue to make it difficult to offload its redundant Airbus A380 fleet, Malaysia Airlines is developing an innovative project to keep its six aircraft flying through the formation of an exclusive Super Jumbo wet-lease business. Although it remains the airlines goal to try and sell the aircraft when it replaces them with new A350 equipment in 2018 and 2019, it believes an alternate option may be required. Speaking during a fireside interview at the World Routes Strategy Summit in Chengdu, China, Peter Bellew, chief executive officer, Malaysia Airlines said: “I don’t want to see them depart to the desert or remain parked in Kuala Lumpur.  We are working on a project to keep them flying.” Under questioning from Flightglobal’s vice president, markets, Mark Pilling, Bellew joked: “We are the proud owner of a spaceship”. However, he noted that although airlines may be reluctant to sign-up long-term to the aircraft, many operators have expressed an interest in using them in a niche capacity. “What we will have to do is be imaginative,” he said. “There is a clear opportunity for the aircraft from markets such as China, but airlines don’t want to buy the aircraft and are nervous of such an investment, yet they have routes that can clearly support the operation of the type on a wet-lease basis.” The tentative plan will see the formation of such a wet-lease operator that will be a sister business to Malaysia Airlines that could see the aircraft remain flying for charter work and third party contracts.  “We have all the infrastructure for the aircraft from training through operations to maintenance so can provide a one stop shop to any operator,” explained Bellew. “I really do think there is a business out there for such an offer.” The Super Jumbos are earmarked for scheduled retirement from 2018, when all six of the carrier’s new A350-900s are due to be delivered on leases from Air Lease Corporation. The A350s will directly replace the A380 on its only remaining scheduled route – Kuala Lumpur-London Heathrow– as well as to serve some stronger medium-haul markets in Asia and into Australasia. Bellew acknowledged that the aircraft will likely remain in Malaysia Airlines operation through to late 2018 to support Hajj and Umrah flying and could continue to play a role in this market. “The Hajj and Umrah is now a 9-10 month business and the Boeing 747-400s are getting towards end of cycle.  The A380, perhaps in a higher density arrangement to how we fly it, will be an ideal aircraft to support this market. I see a future for the aircraft doing this.  I think it could ultimately absorb 6 to 12 aircraft,” he said. The proposed project shows the modern business attitude at the Asian flag carrier. While it might seem from the outside that nothing has changed, Malaysia Airlines has been completely reborn as a business over the last 18 months. Now, the carrier is planning a growth trajectory across south-east Asia under the stewardship of former Ryanair executive, Bellew. “To be honest there was a lot to do around our network.  We had been flying routes that didn’t make sense, flying the wrong aircraft on services and at the wrong times.  We have worked to fix this now,” said Bellew. The realignment of its network and growth to an average aircraft utilisation of 12 hours per day is delivering 100 extra hours of capacity a day, the equivalent of six extra narrowbodies joining the fleet in 2017. “This can certainly be deemed ambitious growth for an airline of our scale,” he said. “We will redeploy capacity principally into China, Japan and South Korea. Our business to china is fantastic. When you consider that only 4% of the population has a passport and that is predicted to grow to 12% in ten years it creates a market for another 150 million international travellers. If I owned the airline myself I'd take the metal and point it all north.” Seasonality schedule changes should also free up capacity for the airline to add up to six or seven brand new routes. “We have some interesting plans,” he said. Watch the full Peter Bellew interview A recent commitment for up to 50 Boeing 737MAX airliners, arriving from 2019, will also enable the carrier to operate more competitively against its rivals. The deal comprises a firm C order for 25 MAX-8s and options for up to 25 MAX-8s or MAX-9s, which will be used not only to replace older equipment on short-haul routes but also to grow the airline’s network. Recently-appointed CEO, Bellew, describes the Boeing deal as “a gamechanger” for the airline, in terms of costs and efficiency, while it will also be able to fly the craft on longer routes of six to seven hours. This will open up new city-pair options out of Kuala Lumpur and other parts of Malaysia that are not commercially sustainable for widebodied equipment.  It will also provide flexibility for network growth with potential to retire or extend leases on its existing 737 Next-Generation fleet and although it better compete alongside low-cost carrier AirAsia in the local market. "If you want to fight a war, you need an enemy to fight," he said. In the short-term the airline is seeking to add three or four additional A330-300s to its fleet to meet the immediate need for additional capacity in some existing markets and to expand in China, Japan and South Korea. “I could deploy them overnight and be profitable immediately on routes to China, Japan and South Korea,” said Bellew. The airline recently retired the Boeing 777 from its fleet in its attempt to become a leader across its home region and capture the air traffic boom across Asia but now acknowledges that it has left the carrier a little short on capacity into markets such as Hong Kong, Delhi and others. While its transition continues, Bellew insisted the turnaround of the airline remains on track, with costs “under control” and the focus now being to “boost revenues”. The airline had a marginally profitable first quarter at operating level, driven by favourable fuel prices, operational improvements, and a strong February, and Bellew is confident the airline will breakeven from the fourth quarter 2017, be fully profitable by 2018, and could be listed on Bursa Malaysia as early as spring 2019. “Together with our shareholder we have set a goal of March 2019 to be listed on Bursa Malaysia.  It is an ambitious timescale and a real stretch, but is certainly an achievable goal,” concluded Bellew.

The only thing worse than the corporate welfare perpetuated by the Export-Import Bank with a three-member board majority would be a rule change allowing a two-member “quorum” on the five-member panel. That would clear the way for even less scrutiny. For more than a year the First Bank of Cronyism has been restricted to transactions of no more than $10 million because of three empty seats on its board. No quorum, no mammoth loans. But a policy rider foisted on a stopgap bill to keep the government funded after Oct. 1 would allow Ex-Im's diminished board to approve massive transactions “temporarily” — to help so-called “small businesses,” which typically means Boeing and General Electric. It's bad enough that this dated institution provides taxpayer-backed loans and loan guarantees — the need for which is spurious, at best — to foreign countries and companies to purchase U.S. products. Small businesses receive less than 20 percent of the bank's subsidies, according to one study. And major players like Boeing can afford their own financing. “This is cronyism working behind the backs of the American people to protect more cronyism,” said Club for Growth President David McIntosh. Just over a year ago Congress rightfully allowed the Ex-Im's charter to expire before liberals came to its rescue. What's proposed now is a rollback in its accountability, which will only make a bad situation worse.

Commercial photography is one industry that has benefited from advances in technology that have brought down the price of drones.

So far these stealthy units — long used by military forces for intelligence-gathering, surveillance and striking targets — have been powered by internal combustion engines or lithium polymer batteries. But now manufacturers are getting ready to replace those with more efficient and longer-lasting hydrogen fuel cells in a bid to accelerate the mainstream commercial adoption of drones — also known as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Amazon is working on a delivery system where drones would get packages to customers in 30 minutes or less using drones, a commercial application that could benefit from advances in how the units are powered. (Amazon/Associated Press) Advancements in fuel-cell performance are being met by cost reductions and innovations on the drones themselves, says Thomas Jones, director of product development at EnergyOr, a Montreal-based company producing small- to mid-size, fuel-cell-powered drones. New technologies converge "We've got two new technologies that are converging at an exponential pace," says Jones. "It's exciting to be involved with … optimizing them together and riding this wave of technology development." Until now, fuel cells have been engineered for commercial use in cars and buses, and in stationary power systems like those that power some cellphone networks. Now that the drone revolution is disrupting a broad range of industries, manufacturers have set their sights on new, potentially lucrative markets. Boeing subsidiary, Insitu, says it hopes to roll out a commercial, hydrogen fuel-cell version of its ScanEagle drone, pictured here, in 2017. (Insitu) A recent study on the commercial applications of drones by consulting firm PwC, valued the emerging global market for business services using drones at more than $165 billion Cdn, with infrastructure, agriculture, transportation and security industries offering the most potential. Drones have come a long way in a short time0:49 One company looking to take advantage of these opportunities is Protonex, a subsidiary of Burnaby-based fuel-cell developer, Ballard Power Systems. Protonex recently delivered its proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells to Insitu, a subsidiary of U.S. aerospace giant Boeing that produces military- and industrial-grade, long-endurance, fixed-wing drones — the kind that look like little airplanes. Multi-rotor drones like this one used for aerial photography, will gain flight time from new fuel-cell technology. (Amiel De Guzman) PEM fuel cells produce electric power on board the drone by reacting hydrogen — in either liquid or gas form — with oxygen. With water as its only byproduct, fuel cells are a clean power solution. Insitu is now testing Protonex's system in the hope of rolling out a commercial, liquefied hydrogen fuel-cell version of its ScanEagle drone in 2017. This is one of the most widely used, high-end UAVs around, having logged miles on military missions from Iraq to the Somali coast. Insitu representatives say they believe that, for some users, the new fuel-cell-powered ScanEagle will bring advantages over its current internal combustion engine. Longer flight times Both power sources offer long-endurance capabilities — a necessity for the eight- to 12-hour flight missions required by Insitu's clients. But fuel cells offer lower noise levels and heat signatures, too, which are particularly compelling features for militaries using drones on clandestine missions. Fuel cells — with fewer moving parts — break down less often than internal combustion engines. They also vibrate less, says Andrew Hayes, director of advanced development at Insitu. That makes for greater stability, important to commercial clients keen to use the drone's sensors and cameras to collect clearer data and visuals, he says.  "Ultimately, … all the customer wants is that data," says Hayes. Some of the applications the company is eyeing include inspecting oil pipelines and railway tracks, fighting forest fires, and monitoring mine sites. San Diego Gas & Electric operator Teena Deering holds a drone as it prepares for takeoff. Site inspections in a range of industries are just one of the applications that drone manufacturers have in mind as they move into commercial markets. (Gregory Bull/Associated Press) For smaller, shorter-endurance, multi-rotor drones — those that look like small helicopters — fuel cells offer even greater competitive edges over the standard power source, rechargeable lithium polymer batteries. Currently, batteries offer flight times of between 15 and 30 minutes on a single battery charge. But hydrogen fuel cells can power drones for up to three hours and are quickly refuelled after landing. Hydrogen fuel cells have higher "energy density," meaning manufacturers can get a lot of energy on board for much less weight, says Jones of EnergyOr.​   "That translates into longer endurance — what it's really all about for us," he says.​ EnergyOr's hydrogen gas fuel cells are now being tested in joint projects with France's Air Force and Spain's National Guard. Regulators scramble to keep up But the rise of drones raises societal concerns, and regulators are only starting to get the legal frameworks in place for their safe and beneficial use. This summer, U.S. transportation and aviation authorities announced national guidelines for non-recreational unmanned aircraft under 25 kg. Transport Canada requires commercial drone operators to get a special flight certificate advising how the UAV can be used. As drones encroach populated areas and flight paths, the evolution of these rules will be critical. Recreational use of drones is on the rise in Canada, and this group seen racing drones at park in Edmonton is just one example. (Terry Reith/CBC) Drones are also getting more popular for recreational use in Canada, which does not require a flight certificate for drones under 35 kg. This paves the way for novices who may not understand the limitations of their drones' battery life, for example. And privacy issues still need to be addressed, as regulations don't cover what kinds of information drones can collect and how that information is used. Perhaps most concerning to the average person: drones can easily capture personal photos and videos. "Transport Canada does a good job ... when it comes to safety issues, but I think that there are other social issues that also need to be addressed," says Kristen Thomasen, a legal expert on drones and incoming professor of law and robotics at the University of Windsor. Thomasen says she believes that a pressing next step is for legal experts, engineers and the public to discuss the privacy implications and the nuisance of buzzing drones overhead. ​Despite these questions, Hayes, of Insitu, foresees fuel cell drones taking ​off in both the military and civilian markets. "I think the fuel cell technology is going to be one of the keys to unlocking that market in a way that we can't do today."

IAG boss sees place for A380 in Iberia and Aer Lingus fleets Tropic Air delivers international flights to Chetumal View All World Routes Interview: Malaysia Airlines plans possible A380 wet-lease operation World Routes News Header World Routes Interview: Malaysia Airlines plans possible A380 wet-lease operation Share Twitter Facebook LinkedIn Google+ Email Print Comment Posted 25 September 2016 21:00 Richard Maslen Editor, Routesonline LinkedIn Twitter Follow @routesonline 5,901 followers While it might seem from the outside that nothing has changed, Malaysia Airlines has been completely reborn as a business over the last 18 months. Now, the carrier is planning a growth trajectory across south-east Asia under the stewardship of former Ryanair executive, Peter Bellew. As market conditions continue to make it difficult to offload its redundant Airbus A380 fleet, Malaysia Airlines is developing an innovative project to keep its six aircraft flying through the formation of an exclusive Super Jumbo wet-lease business. Although it remains the airlines goal to try and sell the aircraft when it replaces them with new A350 equipment in 2018 and 2019, it believes an alternate option may be required. Speaking during a fireside interview at the World Routes Strategy Summit in Chengdu, China, Peter Bellew, chief executive officer, Malaysia Airlines said: “I don’t want to see them depart to the desert or remain parked in Kuala Lumpur.  We are working on a project to keep them flying.” Under questioning from Flightglobal’s vice president, markets, Mark Pilling, Bellew joked: “We are the proud owner of a spaceship”. However, he noted that although airlines may be reluctant to sign-up long-term to the aircraft, many operators have expressed an interest in using them in a niche capacity. “What we will have to do is be imaginative,” he said. “There is a clear opportunity for the aircraft from markets such as China, but airlines don’t want to buy the aircraft and are nervous of such an investment, yet they have routes that can clearly support the operation of the type on a wet-lease basis.” The tentative plan will see the formation of such a wet-lease operator that will be a sister business to Malaysia Airlines that could see the aircraft remain flying for charter work and third party contracts.  “We have all the infrastructure for the aircraft from training through operations to maintenance so can provide a one stop shop to any operator,” explained Bellew. “I really do think there is a business out there for such an offer.” The Super Jumbos are earmarked for scheduled retirement from 2018, when all six of the carrier’s new A350-900s are due to be delivered on leases from Air Lease Corporation. The A350s will directly replace the A380 on its only remaining scheduled route – Kuala Lumpur-London Heathrow– as well as to serve some stronger medium-haul markets in Asia and into Australasia. Bellew acknowledged that the aircraft will likely remain in Malaysia Airlines operation through to late 2018 to support Hajj and Umrah flying and could continue to play a role in this market. “The Hajj and Umrah is now a 9-10 month business and the Boeing 747-400s are getting towards end of cycle.  The A380, perhaps in a higher density arrangement to how we fly it, will be an ideal aircraft to support this market. I see a future for the aircraft doing this.  I think it could ultimately absorb 6 to 12 aircraft,” he said. The proposed project shows the modern business attitude at the Asian flag carrier. While it might seem from the outside that nothing has changed, Malaysia Airlines has been completely reborn as a business over the last 18 months. Now, the carrier is planning a growth trajectory across south-east Asia under the stewardship of former Ryanair executive, Bellew. “To be honest there was a lot to do around our network.  We had been flying routes that didn’t make sense, flying the wrong aircraft on services and at the wrong times.  We have worked to fix this now,” said Bellew. The realignment of its network and growth to an average aircraft utilisation of 12 hours per day is delivering 100 extra hours of capacity a day, the equivalent of six extra narrowbodies joining the fleet in 2017. “This can certainly be deemed ambitious growth for an airline of our scale,” he said. “We will redeploy capacity principally into China, Japan and South Korea. Our business to china is fantastic. When you consider that only 4% of the population has a passport and that is predicted to grow to 12% in ten years it creates a market for another 150 million international travellers. If I owned the airline myself I'd take the metal and point it all north.” Seasonality schedule changes should also free up capacity for the airline to add up to six or seven brand new routes. “We have some interesting plans,” he said. Watch the full Peter Bellew interview A recent commitment for up to 50 Boeing 737MAX airliners, arriving from 2019, will also enable the carrier to operate more competitively against its rivals. The deal comprises a firm C order for 25 MAX-8s and options for up to 25 MAX-8s or MAX-9s, which will be used not only to replace older equipment on short-haul routes but also to grow the airline’s network. Recently-appointed CEO, Bellew, describes the Boeing deal as “a gamechanger” for the airline, in terms of costs and efficiency, while it will also be able to fly the craft on longer routes of six to seven hours. This will open up new city-pair options out of Kuala Lumpur and other parts of Malaysia that are not commercially sustainable for widebodied equipment.  It will also provide flexibility for network growth with potential to retire or extend leases on its existing 737 Next-Generation fleet and although it better compete alongside low-cost carrier AirAsia in the local market. "If you want to fight a war, you need an enemy to fight," he said. In the short-term the airline is seeking to add three or four additional A330-300s to its fleet to meet the immediate need for additional capacity in some existing markets and to expand in China, Japan and South Korea. “I could deploy them overnight and be profitable immediately on routes to China, Japan and South Korea,” said Bellew. The airline recently retired the Boeing 777 from its fleet in its attempt to become a leader across its home region and capture the air traffic boom across Asia but now acknowledges that it has left the carrier a little short on capacity into markets such as Hong Kong, Delhi and others. While its transition continues, Bellew insisted the turnaround of the airline remains on track, with costs “under control” and the focus now being to “boost revenues”. The airline had a marginally profitable first quarter at operating level, driven by favourable fuel prices, operational improvements, and a strong February, and Bellew is confident the airline will breakeven from the fourth quarter 2017, be fully profitable by 2018, and could be listed on Bursa Malaysia as early as spring 2019. “Together with our shareholder we have set a goal of March 2019 to be listed on Bursa Malaysia.  It is an ambitious timescale and a real stretch, but is certainly an achievable goal,” concluded Bellew.

The sides will accordingly discuss the legal aspects of the deals to precipitate their implementaiton, Akhondi told reporters, IRNA news agency reported September 24. The two aircraft manufacturers were authorized by the US Treasury earlier this week to sell their products to Iran, months after Iran signed deals with the companies. In January Iran and Airbus signed a deal over 118 airliners. But the company could not accomplish the deal as it was restricted by the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the United States in doing business with Iran. A similar deal between Tehran and Boeing had the same story. Iran plans to buy about 500 aircraft in 10 years to refurbish its aging fleet. Iranian airliners average 25 in age.

First designed in the 1960s at the height of the Cold War, the Minuteman nuclear weapons are starting to show their age, and replacement parts are difficult to find for the weapons designed in an analog age. Also ageing are their silos, many built in the 1950s and now rusting as water seeps through the decaying concrete. Over the next 20 years, the US Air Force will switch out the entirety of its Minuteman III  fleet with an as-yet-unnamed new missile known only as the Ground Based Strategic Deterrent (GBSD). The Air Force estimates the cost of the GBSD, to be introduced late in the 2020s and phased in over the following decade, will be around US$86 billion (RM354.27 billion) over the missiles' life cycle of about 50 years. Critics point to the Defence Department's long history of projects going way over budget and say the cost of replacing the nukes and maintaining their launch facilities is not warranted, given the tactical threats the United States currently faces.  The Air Force “doesn't know how we are going to afford this,” said Laicie Heeley, a nuclear expert at the Stimson Centre, a nonpartisan anti-nuclear proliferation think tank in Washington. “Nuclear is crowding out more conventional systems that are (better suited to) the threats of today.” America's nuclear triad The Air Force issued requests for proposals in July for vendors to replace the Minuteman, named after colonial militiamen who eventually fought against the British in America's Revolutionary War. The prize will likely go to one of the three US defence giants: Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman and Boeing, and the new missile will be equipped with state-of-the-art electronics while being protected from any cyber threats. America's intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) are just one leg of its “triad” — a three-pronged nuclear attack force also comprising submarines and bombers. The Pentagon wants to replace or modernize all three legs of the triad, at a cost experts estimate will hit US$1 trillion over the next 30 years. “We flat can't afford it. And from a priorities standpoint, it's the wrong priority in the world that we face,” Democratic Congressman Adam Smith told a Washington forum last week, noting that the ICBM force is the part of the triad best suited for reduction. The lawmaker said countries like China are able to boast a “spectacular deterrent” with far fewer nuclear weapons. “What they have is enough to say 'Don't screw with us, or we will obliterate you,'” he said, adding that even if the United States were to enter a major nuclear fight, “we're pretty much all toast anyways.” The Pentagon insists it is imperative to push ahead with a complete overhaul of America's nuclear force. While the United States and Russia signed a treaty in 2010 to reduce the numbers of nuclear launchers, Moscow is modernising its own triad. “The Russians, the Chinese, the North Koreans are upgrading all of their systems,” an Air Force official told AFP, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the nuclear programme.  “They are upgrading all of their legs of the triad — in that environment, I am not sure it makes sense” to do nothing. Another Air Force official said many of the vendors who first built or equipped the missile silos have long gone out of business, making it an arduous task to find replacement parts.  He said he'd heard anecdotes of colleagues scouring Ebay or other sites looking for antique components. The Minuteman fleet is currently dotted across locations in North Dakota, Wyoming and Montana.  Defence Secretary Ashton Carter will tomorrow visit Minot Air Force Base in North Dakota, where control centres for that state's nukes are located.  The Air Force has in recent years battled flagging morale among its “missileers” — airmen in charge of the land-based missile force.  A series of embarrassing revelations in 2014 described the state of the nuclear force, with dozens of airmen disciplined cheating on a test. Other investigations have probed drug use.  The trouble began after the demise of the Soviet Union, as the mission gradually received a lower priority and offered a less-promising career path. — AFP                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Trump’s daughter Ivanka sits in on landmark Japan PM talks Thousands to rally against rising intolerance in Indonesia 14 dead as Philippine army clash with Abu Sayyaf militants Chinese astronauts return to earth after longest space mission European leaders, Obama vow to hold fast to Nato Trump and his aides plan next moves as protests spread (VIDEO) Tsunami hits New Zealand after series of strong quakes Trump considers seeking Bill Clinton’s advice Trump will get wake-up call when he takes office, Obama says Trump to lay out White House goals in prime-time interview Most Watched Now Week Jessica Chastain in ‘The Zookeeper’s Wife’ Neil Patrick Harris stars as Count Olaf in trailer for ‘A Series of Unfortunate Events’ Britney Spears, TInashe get down for a ‘Slumber Party’ (WARNING: EXPLICIT LANGUAGE) Ah Beng reviews iguana’s epic escape from snakes (WARNING: EXPLICIT LANGUAGE) Did you know: The ocean is way deeper than you think Reuters Video: Thailand sinks boats to tackle illegal fishing Related Articles European TV enjoys ‘halcyon’ days as home-grown shows push US series out of primetime World at ‘dangerous’ point as US-Russia tensions soar, Gorbachev says Lebanese shun pricey, polluted beaches for trips abroad Discovered in a dacha wall, a clue to a Cold War mystery BBC unearths video of infamous UK double agent discussing treachery Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2016 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | RecomN - Local Services

First designed in the 1960s at the height of the Cold War, the Minuteman nuclear weapons are starting to show their age, and replacement parts are difficult to find for the weapons designed in an analog age. Also aging are their silos, many built in the 1950s and now rusting as water seeps through the decaying concrete. Over the next 20 years, the US Air Force will switch out the entirety of its Minuteman III fleet with an as-yet-unnamed new missile known only as the Ground Based Strategic Deterrent (GBSD). The Air Force estimates the cost of the GBSD, to be introduced late in the 2020s and phased in over the following decade, will be around $86 billion over the missiles' life cycle of about 50 years. Critics point to the Defense Department's long history of projects going way over budget and say the cost of replacing the nukes and maintaining their launch facilities is not warranted, given the tactical threats the United States currently faces. The Air Force "doesn't know how we are going to afford this," said Laicie Heeley, a nuclear expert at the Stimson Center, a nonpartisan anti-nuclear proliferation think tank in Washington. "Nuclear is crowding out more conventional systems that are (better suited to) the threats of today." America's nuclear triad The Air Force issued requests for proposals in July for vendors to replace the Minuteman, named after colonial militiamen who eventually fought against the British in America's Revolutionary War. The prize will likely go to one of the three US defense giants: Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman and Boeing, and the new missile will be equipped with state-of-the-art electronics while being protected from any cyber threats. America's intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) are just one leg of its "triad" - a three-pronged nuclear attack force also comprising submarines and bombers. The Pentagon wants to replace or modernize all three legs of the triad, at a cost experts estimate will hit $1 trillion over the next 30 years. "We flat can't afford it. And from a priorities standpoint, it's the wrong priority in the world that we face," Democratic Congressman Adam Smith told a Washington forum last week, noting that the ICBM force is the part of the triad best suited for reduction. The lawmaker said countries like China are able to boast a "spectacular deterrent" with far fewer nuclear weapons. "What they have is enough to say 'Don't screw with us, or we will obliterate you,'" he said, adding that even if the United States were to enter a major nuclear fight, "we're pretty much all toast anyways." The Pentagon insists it is imperative to push ahead with a complete overhaul of America's nuclear force. While the United States and Russia signed a treaty in 2010 to reduce the numbers of nuclear launchers, Moscow is modernizing its own triad. "The Russians, the Chinese, the North Koreans are upgrading all of their systems," an Air Force official told AFP, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the nuclear program.

Share story By Jessica Lee and Mike Baker Seattle Times staff reporters When Evangelina Lara heard commotion at the Cascade Mall on Friday evening, she feared the worst. Her 16-year-old daughter, Sarai Lara, was inside Macy’s and she could not get to her from across the mall. Seven hours later, her fears were confirmed. Lara, a Mount Vernon High School sophomore, was one of five people killed when a gunman opened fire in the Burlington department store. The victims ranged from Lara to a 52-year-old Macy’s employee to a 95-year-old woman at the mall with her daughter. “It’s not fair what happened to her,” Evangelina said of Lara, speaking through a translator Saturday evening in the family’s kitchen, surrounded by at least a dozen friends and family members. Born in Mount Vernon, the high-school sophomore was bright, smiley and her mother’s “right hand” at home with the family, Evangelina said. Sarai balanced a wide net of friends at school with helping at home, especially with her 5-year-old sister. The family has Mexican roots, and Sarai was proud of her heritage, her mother said. In her free time, she enjoyed going out with friends, texting and shopping, Evangelina said. Family and friends remember her as “the perfect child.” “She was the most beautiful girl in Washington,” her mother said. “I don’t know what I’m going to do.” “She was too young to get murdered like that,” said her 19-year-old brother, Salvador Lara. Another victim was Chuck Eagan, a longtime Boeing maintenance worker from Lake Stevens, said his aunt, Carol Thrush. She said Eagan and his wife were out for a dinner and shopping at the mall, and they had made their way to Macy’s when the shooter opened fire. Thrush said Eagan and his wife began running, but his wife fell down as she was trying to get away. As Eagan helped his wife, he was shot, Thrush said. Cascade Mall Shooting Suspect in Cascade Mall shooting arrested in Oak Harbor Five people are dead after a gunman opened fire at Burlington's Cascade Mall on Friday night Victims’ families grieve the loss of loved ones at Burlington mall Man charged in Cascade Mall shooting was getting court-ordered mental-health treatment Police mistakenly describe Cascade Mall shooting suspect as ‘Hispanic,’ protests erupt on Twitter Seattle Sketcher: Tokens of support grace impromptu Cascade Mall memorial Cascade Mall shooting at a glance: the victims, the community, the suspect Other mass shootings in Washington state Opinion: ‘Inaction in the face of mass shootings is unacceptable’ Thrush said Eagan, who had two daughters, was planning on retiring from Boeing next year with hopes of doing some travel. “He was just a wonderful person,” Thrush said. Another victim is believed by her family to be Shayla Martin, a 52-year-old from Mount Vernon who worked as a makeup artist at Macy’s. Martin’s sister, Karen Van Horn, declined to talk Saturday evening. “We’re really having a tough time right now,” Van Horn said in a brief phone call. Van Horn, an employee at The Herald in Everett, told the newspaper that family members hadn’t heard an official confirmation she was among the victims, but a witness told them her younger sister was among the dead. Van Horn described Martin as an avid reader who was both classy and practical. “She was so sweet,” Van Horn told The Herald. “She was just very independent. She wanted to make her own way. She didn’t want to rely on anyone else.” Blanca Mendoza, a co-worker of Martin, saw her earlier on Friday night in the cosmetics department. The cosmetics section was busy with customers, so Mendoza had gone to help — something for which Martin always expressed appreciation. “She thanked me for always coming when they call for help,” said Mendoza, 23. She recalled Martin as a sweet co-worker who would always say hello, strike up a conversation and joke that Mendoza should come work with her in cosmetics. Mendoza was inside the mall when the shooting happened, but was away on her break. Meanwhile, a family member identified Belinda Galde, 64, and her mother as victims of the shooting but declined further comment. KIRO identified the mother as Beatrice Dotson, 95. Galde worked as a probation officer out of Arlington for Snohomish County District Courts, according to the Washington State Courts website. The district court issued a statement late Saturday calling her death “an unimaginable and tragic loss.” “Belinda was a devoted and esteemed public servant for our court since 1989,” working to “ensure public safety and dedicated her life to assisting those who stumbled along the way in life,” the statement said. “She was an amazing kind and caring individual who was much adored by her friends, her coworkers and the thousands of probationers who she helped find a better way to live.” Times staff researcher Miyoko Wolf contributed to this report.

Matthew DiLallo (TMFmd19) Sep 24, 2016 at 12:00PM Image source: Getty Images. While commercial drones have been flying since the early 1980s, their importance to commerce is just starting to take off. According to a recent report (link opens PDF) by business consultancy PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), the potential commercial applications for drones is astounding. It found that the global value of drone-powered solutions is $127.3 billion, with the best prospect for drone applications being the infrastructure sector, which PwC pegs at a $45.2 billion opportunity. Drilling down into the infrastructure opportunity The reason PwC sees a vast opportunity for drones in the infrastructure sector is that these companies not only perform hazardous work but operate complex assets distributed over large areas. It cites energy companies as one sector that should be one of the first big beneficiaries of drone technology solutions. That's because drones can increase safety and save money by performing three critical applications: investment monitoring, maintenance, and asset inventory. Several companies have already used drones for these applications, and given the initial results, drone usage is likely to continue to become an increasingly important tool for American infrastructure companies. Drones in flight: Saving lives, time, and money Drones have already taken flight in the oil and gas sector with ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) making history in 2013 after it was the first company approved by the U.S. for the commercial use of a drone. That initial flight took place in remote airspace over the Chukchi Sea in Alaska with a ScanEagle drone manufactured by a subsidiary of Boeing (NYSE:BA). ConocoPhillips used the drone for marine mammal and ice surveys offshore Alaska as it prepared to conduct exploratory drilling in the region. While the company never moved forward with this particular drilling project, drones are becoming an increasingly important tool for oil and gas companies. Not only are oil companies using drones to gather data for exploration, but they are using them for inspection operations to determine which drilling rigs need maintenance. For example, producers BP (NYSE:BP), Shell (NYSE: RDS-A) (NYSE: RDS-B), and Apache (NYSE: APA) are using drones to inspect offshore oil rigs in the North Sea for damage. In this case, drones equipped with high-definition and thermal cameras are replacing workers that needed to hang from a wire to inspect rigs. This replacement not only improves safety but it can save time and money, which is critical given where oil prices are these days. The oil industry is not the only one employing drones for safety reasons. Telecom giant AT&T (NYSE:T) recently completed a trial using drones to inspect its cell towers. It did so because "every time we use a drone it's just one less tower climb. Every tower climb that we can save provides a safer situation, or less opportunity for potential injury." AT&T hailed the trial as a success and going forward it plans to use drones in its tower operations to inspect them for trouble spots. While the drones will not replace tower climbers, it will enable the company to use them more efficiently because they will not have to climb every tower, and when they do, they will know what to expect and will have the proper equipment with them. Image source: AeroVironment.  Cashing in on the drone revolution Most of the companies that operate drones serving the infrastructure sector are privately held, which limits investment options. Furthermore, several drone makers are embedded in larger companies like Boeing and are therefore a small piece of their global business, which limits investors' direct upside. That said, investors do have at one compelling option to consider. AeroVironment (NASDAQ:AVAV) is an early leader in the unmanned aircraft space after spending decades developing solutions for the military. It is initially branching into commercial applications to change the way farmers and energy providers monitor and manage their assets. AeroVironment has developed a turnkey information solution, with its Puma AE its first commercial drone approved by the Federal Aviation Administration. That drone is already in the field with British oil giant BP, which currently uses it to monitor operations at its Prudhoe Bay oil field in Alaska. That said, commercial drone applications are a small part of AeroVironment's current sales, though it represents a massive opportunity for the company over the long term.    Investor takeaway Drones are just starting to take flight to provide time- and money-saving solutions to infrastructure companies. While that is good news for investors in companies that own large infrastructure portfolios like BP or AT&T, there aren't many worthwhile direct drone investment options out there right now other than AeroVironment. That said, new investment opportunities should arise down the road as more infrastructure operators start employing drones. Matt DiLallo owns shares of AeroVironment and ConocoPhillips.

Menu About Information Operations Holistic Organizers IO, Cyber, SC, PD Community Calendar Cybersecurity Computer Scientists Close In on Perfect, Hack-Proof Code September 23, 2016 Joel Harding BOYA SUN FOR QUANTA MAGAZINE IN THE SUMMER of 2015 a team of hackers attempted to take control of an unmanned military helicopter known as Little Bird. The helicopter, which is similar to the piloted version long-favored for US special operations missions, was stationed at a Boeing facility in Arizona. The hackers had a head start: At the time they began the operation, they already had access to one part of the drone’s computer system. From there, all they needed to do was hack into Little Bird’s onboard flight-control computer, and the drone was theirs. When the project started, a “Red Team” of hackers could have taken over the helicopter almost as easily as it could break into your home Wi-Fi. But in the intervening months, engineers from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency had implemented a new kind of security mechanism—a software system that couldn’t be commandeered. Key parts of Little Bird’s computer system were unhackable with existing technology, its code as trustworthy as amathematical proof. Even though the Red Team was given six weeks with the drone and more access to its computing network than genuine bad actors could ever expect to attain, they failed to crack Little Bird’s defenses. “They were not able to break out and disrupt the operation in any way,” said Kathleen Fisher, a professor of computer science at Tufts University and the founding program manager of the High-Assurance Cyber Military Systems (HACMS) project. “That result made all of Darpa stand up and say, oh my goodness, we can actually use this technology in systems we care about.” The technology that repelled the hackers was a style of software programming known as formal verification. Unlike most computer code, which is written informally and evaluated based mainly on whether it works, formally verified software reads like a mathematical proof: Each statement follows logically from the preceding one. An entire program can be tested with the same certainty that mathematicians prove theorems. “You’re writing down a mathematical formula that describes the program’s behavior and using some sort of proof checker that’s going to check the correctness of that statement,” saidBryan Parno, who does research on formal verification and security at Microsoft Research.

Source: Sikorsky-Boeing The US Army's Joint Multirole-Technology Demonstrator (JMR-TD)/Future Vertical Lift (FVL) effort is moving towards first flights in 2017, but meanwhile is focused on crucial system architecture demonstrations. Dan Bailey, the army's programme director for JMR/FVL, said the effort is demonstrating the platform and, perhaps more importantly, its mission system architecture. US Army and US Navy planners hope to eventually replace a variety of aircraft via FVL. Among other initial parameters, the government is seeking a platform to carry 4 crew and 12 or more troops, self-deploy out to 2,100 n miles, and fly at up to 230 kt or more. "We're into the second of our mission system architecture demonstrations," Bailey said during 23 September comments at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, DC. Subsystem technology is particularly important, Bailey said, because he expects an FVL to be flying for many years in many environments, and therefore requiring easy upgrades. For example, he noted aircraft such as the Boeing AH-64 Apache has been flying for decades and will continue for many more, but newly integrated subsystems have kept the platform viable. Apaches were designed in the 1970s and first delivered to the US Army in 1984. The JMR-TD programme's focus over the next year is on an architecture implementation process demonstration (AIPD), and six contractors are working on that to validate interoperability between the various pieces, Ryan Bunge, Rockwell Collins' manager for Special Operations, Air Force, and Advanced Rotary-Wing Programs, said during the event. The platforms themselves are to begin flying prototypes late in 2017, and these will undergo 150-200 hours of flight time - and downtime to review data - that take it through 2019, Bailey said. Those flights are likely to uncover engineering issues that will have to be worked out during a development phase. Want to read more?

But miniature representations of potential future weaponry have been on the wane (though not altogether absent) as budgets tighten and the Pentagon searches for ways to buy arms more cheaply. And yet, defense firms were showing off all sorts of far-out concepts at this week’s Air, Space and Cyber conference, the annual gathering of airpower leaders and defense executives in National Harbor, Maryland, the faux city just outside the Washington Beltway. Perhaps industry has grown impatient with complaints from Pentagon acquisition undersecretary Frank Kendall that the U.S. is losing its technological edge to the likes of China, and has set out to prove him wrong. Lockheed Martin offered a black flying wing, akin to the B-2 bomber, but larger, with a T-tail and two massive engines. (One aerospace expert said the model’s turbofans, which probably don’t exist yet, would likely be the largest ever built.) Lockheed officials said cargo and tanker planes of the future could look like this. Boeing outfitted models of three 737 commercial jetliners with different types of communications equipment that could replace the Air Force’s Compass Call, JSTARS, and Rivet Joint surveillance planes. One of them was based on the 737 Max, a variant so recent it hasn’t yet entered commercial service.

Few of these projects have Pentagon funding, but firms are spending their own money to show that that they’re thinking ahead. Cobham, for example, is building special radars for drones that could help them detect and avoid other aircraft in the sky. It’s clear the Pentagon’s push for new technology, reflected by Deputy Defense Secretary Robert Work’s Third Offset, is taking root — inside the defense industry anyway. The question that now remains: will there be any money down the road to buy new stuff? Welcome!

From Defense One Sikorsky’s New Ace in the Hole: Lockheed’s Skunk Works // Marcus Weisgerber The newly acquired helicopter maker is tapping into Lockheed Martin’s famed advanced tech division. US Air Force Grounds F-35s It Just Declared Ready for War // Marcus Weisgerber Crumbling avionics lines are the latest setback for the jet, which had been riding a wave of progress. Tomorrow’s Downed Pilots May Be Rescued by an Osprey-Black Hawk Team // Marcus Weisgerber A U.S. Air Force chief of staff who was shot down over Serbia has reenergized the debate over the best way to do combat search and rescue. Sikorsky’s Defense Chief, One-on-One The helicopter maker that became part of Lockheed Martin last year is running faster than ever, says Sam Mehta, president of Sikorsky Defense Systems & Services. He chatted with Defense One on the sidelines of the annual AFA conference about a military helicopter portfolio that includes the Air Force’s Combat Rescue Helicopter, Marine Corps’ VH-92 Presidential Helicopter, and the Army’s search for a helicopter of the future. Mehta pointed to Sikorsky’s contract to deliver its first new HH-60 to the Air Force in 2020. The aircraft is required to arrive within 75 months of the order — but the firm gets a bonus if it comes six months early. “We’re tracking very well toward the 69 months,” Mehta said. “The idea is not to rely upon the contract schedule, the idea is to try to get this program and these helicopters pulled left as far as possible. Nobody on my team recognizes or understands 75 months. They all know they’re being measured to a 69-month schedule to achieve early deliveries.” Sikorsky’s defense chief says his firm, whose acquisition by Lockheed Martin was finalized in November, could build the aircraft even faster than that. “We can take advantage of a very hot supply chain that we have in order to pull parts and components left. We also have the manufacturing capacity and the final assembly capacity to be able to do that.” Another project where Mehta says the helicopter maker is working faster: the Army’s Future Vertical Lift project. “It may be the only area in this program where we fundamentally agree with our competitor,” he said. Bell, who is competing against Sikorsky and its partner Boeing, has also said it could build an aircraft faster. “We’re ready to bring the schedule left. I think we’ve done a fair amount of risk reduction with our X2 technology demonstrator,” Mehta said. “We’re flying the S-97 Raider right now.…We think we could be well-positioned for an aircraft with mature technologies, a proven flight system, all the data and analysis that comes with it to be able to compete as a product offering, not only as a technology, as early as 2020.” The Army doesn’t plan to field this new helicopter tech, which will replace the Black Hawks and Apaches until the 2030s, a timeframe that has drawn some criticism. Human-Machine Collaboration The Air Force wants to buy a new plane and radar to track people, vehicles and aircraft to replace the E-8C JSTARS. But it wants that plane to be smaller, its crew slimmed down, and its computers far smarter and more capable. Boeing, which is leading one of three teams competing for the contract, brought to AFA a semitrailer outfitted like a 737 with computer consoles. The new computers, said one employee on the project who flew missions in the back of an E-8C, are far more advanced than those in the planes now. They can better identify targets and even suggest the best type of weapon to use in a strike. Foreign Sales Wrapup The U.S. late Wednesday cleared a $1.9 billion sale of four Boeing KC-46 tankers to Japan. Japan already has four Boeing KC-767 tankers. In case you’re wondering, still no word on whether the U.S. approved the much-anticipated, fighter jet deals to Kuwait and Qatar with a combined $7 billion.

A decade or so from now, Marines could be using a laser-armed version of this bizarre copter-plane to take out enemies over the horizon. It’s the LightningStrike from Aurora Flight Sciences, which is currently the prime contractor on the VTOL X-Plane project by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. An Aurora representative says that “there’s quite a bit of interest” in a laser-armed version of the drone, particularly for use in Marine Corps missions. The LightningStrike uses a hybrid electric distributed propulsion system. A Rolls-Royce AE 1107C turboshaft engine drives three Honeywell generators, which produce a total of three megawatts of electrical power. “That’s enough to power a small town,” John Tylko, the chief innovation officer at Aurora Flight Sciences, pointed out to Defense One at the Air Force Association’s Air Space Cyber conference outside of Washington, D.C. Currently, the LightningStrike uses the juice to run 24 ducted fans that lift the aircraft vertically, then rotate to push it forward, similar to a Boeing V-22 Osprey. But there’s plenty of excess power for other uses, at least while the aircraft is in cruise mode, when its lift fans need only one megawatt.

Be the first to receive updates. “The biggest advantage of this capability is that because it’s generating so much electrical power, it has significant available power in cruise for directed energy payloads or for electronic warfare countermeasure payloads that can be useful in this future landscape,” Tylko said. “Governments are putting a lot of effort into this directed energy.” Aurora and DARPA are talking to different services about what they might want to do with the LightningStrike. “We’re just at the beginnings of that, but the most likely customer is the Marine Corps,” who are attracted by the combination of vertical lift and a forward speed of about 400 knots, Tylko said. Defense One has asked the Marines for comment. Aurora isn’t the only drone maker looking to put lasers on flying robots. Last year, General Atomics, maker of the famous MQ-1 Predator and MQ-9 Reaper drones, announced that they were undertaking a privately funded study to incorporate a massive 150-kilowatt laser into their large Predator C drone. The LightningStrike, which would be a medium-altitude drone, doesn’t really compete with the Reaper. Tylko cautioned that a laser-tipped LightningStrike “is ten to twenty years off; it’s really pushing the state of the art. It’s not likely to be fielded in the near term.” In the meantime, Aurora and others are leading the charge away from human pilots and toward more autonomous flying weapons. “Remotely piloted vehicles, that’s a technology from the 1990s,” Tylko said. “Predator and Reaper still need to be flown manually because that’s a technology that’s 20 years old.” Marines staging a beachhead assault, or running an artillery base on the border of a battle zone, don’t generally have much time to devote to drone pilot training or ground crew operations. Aurora is focusing heavily on autonomy and GPS independence across its drone portfolio, including the LightningStrike, to create flying weapons that can pilot themselves — but humans would still be in charge of deciding when to fire, in keeping with current military policy.

The sides will accordingly discuss the legal aspects of the deals to precipitate their implementaiton, Akhondi told reporters, IRNA news agency reported September 24. The two aircraft manufacturers were authorized by the US Treasury earlier this week to sell their products to Iran, months after Iran signed deals with the companies. In January Iran and Airbus signed a deal over 118 airliners. But the company could not accomplish the deal as it was restricted by the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the United States in doing business with Iran. A similar deal between Tehran and Boeing had the same story. Iran plans to buy about 500 aircraft in 10 years to refurbish its aging fleet. Iranian airliners average 25 in age.

Follow @routesonline 5,901 followers While Brazil’s economic woes may be casting a considerable shadow over the region, other parts of Latin America are faring better. Brazil may still be basking in the afterglow of hosting the Olympic Games but the event has proved to be a brief ray of sunshine in an otherwise bleak year for Latin America’s biggest economy. The country has been mired in a nasty recession - the economy shrank by 5.4% in the first quarter of 2016 - and an ongoing political crisis, which has had an inevitable impact on air traffic in and around Brazil. The country’s political instability has also led to a delay in the ratification of an open skies agreement with the US. Figures from International Air Transport Association (IATA) show that the domestic Brazilian air market has been the worst performing major region in the world with traffic (as measured by revenue passenger kilometres) falling by 6.8% during the first six months of 2016. However, other parts of Latin America are faring much better. Across the region, total passenger traffic rose by 3.7% and average load factors edged up by 0.2 percentage points to 80% for the first half of 2016. The continent’s international travel fared even better, with a 7.5% increase in traffic and load factors up 0.9 points to 80.6%. But Brazil’s woes are casting a considerable shadow over the region’s recent success stories, which include Chile, Peru and Colombia, plus Central America and Mexico to the north. The continent’s largest airline, LATAM, has reacted by continuing to cut capacity within Brazil – current plans by the carrier will see a reduction of between 10% and 12% in domestic seats this year compared with 2015. There also seems very little light at the end of the tunnel, with LATAM’s CEO Enrique Cueto admitting the Brazilian market is “expected to remain challenged for at least the next two years”. The airline has been quick to point out that other areas have “experienced demand growth and healthy profitability on international and domestic operations”, including Chile, Argentina, Peru, Colombia and Ecuador. Meanwhile, Brazilian low-cost carrier Gol has responded to the country’s economic woes by implementing a major cost-cutting programme. This has included suspending flights to eight destinations and plans to reduce its fleet by around 15% by the end of this year. Another competitor, Azul, has also had to cut costs and capacity as well as defer expansion plans. John Grant, senior analyst at aviation data specialist OAG, says: “The bubble has burst in Brazil. The economic environment is dragging down consumer demand quite considerably at the same time as capacity growth has been put into the market. It’s going to continue to be soft for the foreseeable future.  “On the other side of South America it’s a more positive story with Chile, Peru and Colombia all performing very well. All three are stable with strong market and economic confidence, which has translated into new air services and capacity.” Colombia, once thought of as a “no-go” zone dominated by drug lords and civil war, has transformed itself as a destination and started to reap the benefits. National airline Avianca, based in Bogota, made an operating profit of $72.2 million in the first quarter of 2016 – a 21.4% increase on the profit it made for the same period last year. Avianca is continuing to step up capacity, which rose by 9% year-on-year, and has been primarily fuelled by international expansion, such as new routes from Bogota to Los Angeles, and adding extra frequencies to London and Madrid. Capacity to Europe has risen by 20.3% this year while traffic has increased by 24.7% pushing transatlantic factors to 82.7% - above the airline’s average of 78.8%. CEO Hernán Rincón said that the airline’s plan was to “selectively grow in specific markets”, such as adding capacity from its Bogota hub to other major regional cities including Santiago and Buenos Aires. Colombia is also benefiting from the growth in low-cost carriers in the region, a development that had previously been concentrated in the major markets of Brazil and Mexico. VivaColombia, which is based in Medellín, has built up a 13.4% market share domestically. The country should be set for more growth with the Colombian government’s plans to further expand Bogota’s El Dorado International Airport, which only opened a new international terminal in 2012. This could see passenger numbers increase from just under 30 million last year to around 40 million by 2021. Bogota is already Latin America’s third busiest airport after São Paulo Guarulhos and Mexico City’s Benito Juárez. Further south in Peru, the plans for expanding Lima’s Jorge Chávez airport have not been going so smoothly. The project to add a second runway has already been delayed by more than 10 years and the latest obstacle has been a contract dispute between Peru’s government and the private company licensed to build the runway, Lima Airport Partners. Better news for the Peruvian capital has been the announcement of new forthcoming European routes, such as Air  Europa’s daily flights from July 2017, and LATAM Peru planning to fly from Lima to Barcelona from December 2016. LATAM has already launched a Lima-Washington Dulles route this year, while British Airways (BA) restarted its services from London Gatwick to Lima in May 2016. BA has been slowly building up its network to South America in the past couple of years – the UK airline has also added San José in Costa Rica during 2016. The Chilean capital Santiago will follow as a new route from London Heathrow from January 3, 2017. “The Chilean economy has been steadily growing, with increasing trade links to Europe, so this new direct route will respond to the need for travel between the two capital cities to do business face-to-face,” said BA CEO Alex Cruz when the route to Santiago was announced. BA’s links with Latin America are set to be strengthened further with its parent company International Airlines Group’s proposed joint business with LATAM. This would see the companies, both part of the Oneworld alliance, being able to coordinate schedules and share revenues – as long as the arrangement is given clearance by competition authorities. LATAM has also signed a similar deal with American Airlines. One part of Latin America where the prospects are even gloomier than in Brazil is Venezuela, which has seen its economy take a savage hit from the collapse in the price of oil in the past couple of years. Venezuela has also been incurring the wrath of airlines by refusing to let them take their money out of the country – the Venezuelan government is currently blocking the repatriation of $3.8 billion in revenue owed to 24 airlines, according to IATA. US-based airlines have been reducing their flights to Caracas due to this impasse and the weakening Venezuelan economy. American Airlines, for example, stopped its New York-Caracas flights in April having only revived the route a few months earlier, although the carrier still flies from Miami to Caracas. LATAM, Aeromexico and Lufthansa are among the airlines to have ended services to Venezuela earlier this year, blaming weak demand. If the fortunes of South America could be divided roughly into east and west by the Andes mountain range, then Mexico, Central America and the Spanish-speaking Caribbean to the north is a distinctive third area of Latin America. Mexico is benefiting from the continued economic strength of the US, which should improve further with the recent implementation of an amended “open skies” agreement between the two countries. “There is optimism in Mexico and Central America – Mexico has been growing really strongly in the last two-and-a-half years,” says OAG’s Grant. “There’s a revised open skies agreement between the US and Mexico that allows more flexibility in air services. There are expansion opportunities – you have to be confident about Mexico and Central America and they should be able to grow by 5-6% per year.” Mexico’s success can be seen in the fact that Mexico City airport last year overtook São Paulo as the airport with the most available seats with an annual capacity of more than 49 million. Elsewhere, Cancún is currently Mexico’s fastest growing airport for international flights, with a rise of 15.4% in services during 2015. The country’s largest airline group, Aeromexico, has been using its fleet of Boeing 787 Dreamliners to grow international routes – particularly to Europe and Asia. Aeromexico will add frequencies to Amsterdam, London, Madrid and Santiago in summer 2017. It will also increase flights to Shanghai by 65% next year. The biggest development in this part of Latin America is the “normalisation” of economic and diplomatic links between the US and Cuba after more than 50 years. Up to eight US-based carriers have won the “tentative” rights to fly to Havana, while six airlines have been granted permission to fly from five US cities to nine other Cuban cities. Airline passenger traffic within Latin America is set to grow by an average of 5.8% per year up to 2035, according to the latest forecast by aircraft manufacturer Boeing. The fastest growth is likely to come for travel within the region with Boeing predicting that passenger traffic within South America will increase by around 6% per year. Although some countries, notably Brazil and Venezuela, are currently going through tough economic times, longer-term trends should drive aviation growth - such as rising middle class populations, higher income levels and the continent’s strength in commodities and natural resources. Both Boeing and Airbus predict that the number of commercial aircraft in service in the region will have to more than double in the next two decades from the current level of 1,550 aircraft to more than 3,600 by 2035. Rafael Alonso, president of Airbus for Latin American and the Caribbean, added: “Latin America’s long-haul route expansion is imminent and we are already seeing airlines respond by opting for larger, longer-range and more efficient aircraft such as the A350 XWB and the A380, which both began operating in the region in 2016. We are also seeing the region’s top airlines modernising their fleets with the A320neo family, allowing them to achieve efficiency gains even in a less-than-favourable economic environment.” LATAM has been leading the way in bringing these new types of aircraft to the continent. South America’s biggest carrier is set to start operating the first Airbus A320neo in Brazil soon. It also began operating its first Airbus A350 XWB aircraft earlier in 2016, which is now operating from São Paulo to Miami and Orlando, as well as Madrid. The biggest challenge may not be acquiring the necessary aircraft but finding solutions for the capacity constraints at key airports in Argentina, Colombia, Ecuador, Mexico and Peru, as passenger numbers are set to double to a predicted 525 million by the middle of the 2030s. Ask what is holding back aviation around Latin America and there are some very clear unanimous answers: high levels of taxation, inadequate government investment in airport infrastructure and excessive bureaucracy. International Airline Transport Association (IATA) has identified 130 different ticket taxes that are being applied across the region, including the Caribbean, and has called on governments to cut this tax burden, which is “undermining the region’s prospects for connectivity growth”. Peter Cerda, IATA regional VP for the Americas, says: “Most of the region’s countries, with the exception of Panama and Chile, have not created the conditions for air transport to flourish. Onerous regulations, which are out of sync with global standards, coupled with excessive taxes, charges and fuel policies that are misaligned with global best practices are commonplace across the region.” The Venezuelan government’s decision to hold on to $3.8 billion of foreign airlines’ money does not help improve the continent’s image, although this is an extreme example. Bureaucracy has also held back the growth of low-cost carriers in some parts of the region. This has been the case in Argentina where the government has imposed pricing limits on airline tickets since 2002. However, this policy is starting to change, which could open the door to low-cost carriers entering the Argentinean market in the near future. There are other positive signs that attitudes are shifting around Latin America, such as the Colombian government’s decision to slash airport fees at Cartagena from $92 to $38 for international flights last year. This move helped boost international passenger traffic by 32% in a year. Eduardo Iglesias, executive director of the Latin American and Caribbean Air Transport Association, has called on governments to work together to help the aviation sector to grow more effectively. “Governments must agree on common global rules to secure a sustained growth of air transport in the region while preserving its competitiveness in relation to the rest of the world,” he says. Air traffic may be growing in the region but the industry is still being “hampered by fragmented airspace, varying standards and protocols, and not enough sharing of data between states”, according to the Civil Air Navigation Services Organisation (CANSO).

The series of panels honors the original 28,000 families and corporations that purchased 53,000 seats in the old Trans World Dome to bring the Rams to St. Louis in 1995. A federal judge has ruled that the Los Angeles Rams must provide season tickets or refunds on deposits for the St. Louis PSLs. Photo by Robert Cohen, rcohen@post-dispatch.com It seems like only yesterday that thousands of otherwise sensible St. Louisans were applying for the chance to spend hundreds or thousands of dollars just to have the right to spend more hundreds or thousands of dollars to watch the St. Louis Rams play football. In fact, as a federal district court reminded us last week, it was 21 years ago. An entire generation of children has grown to adulthood, grown facial hair and gotten tattoos since the mad scramble for “personal seat licenses” in January 1995. It seemed like a rip-off then, and sure enough, it was. U.S. District Court Judge Stephen N. Limbaugh Jr. ruled last week that everyone who got one of the original PSLs to watch the Rams play football in St. Louis might be entitled to some sort of refund someday, but they’re not entitled to buy (and presumably, resell at a premium) tickets to watch them play in Los Angeles. It was just another football-related disappointment in a city that should be used to them by now. Given everything that’s happened since, it’s weird to recall how St. Louis lost its collective mind in 1995. Things were kind of desperate. We’d been through the Great Flood of 1993. McDonnell Douglas was being stalked by Boeing. The NFL had abandoned St. Louis in 1987. The Cardinals were on an austerity kick and Major League Baseball players were on strike. But against all odds, the Missouri Legislature had ponied up half the cost of a new, built-on-spec domed stadium downtown. When St. Louis failed to get an NFL expansion team in 1993, it needed an NFL tenant in the worst sort of way. That’s exactly the way we got the Rams. The late Jerry Clinton, the beer wholesaler who’d gotten the stadium off the ground, had been shoved aside by local bigshots who deemed him insufficiently rich. They formed FANS Inc. (Football At the New Stadium) and began trailing their coat in Los Angeles. They needed a really rich guy to show the NFL, so they signed up a Columbia, Mo., real estate tycoon named Stan Kroenke. Due diligence was in short supply. FANS Inc. had negotiated one of the worst leases in the history of sports. Kroenke spotted the hole in it right away, the part that gave the team permission to move after 20 years if the stadium wasn’t up to the league’s top standards. He bought a minority stake in the Rams that included first right of refusal for the rest. And then he bade his time, because 20 years is nothing to a real estate man. FANS Inc. set about selling PSLs to raise the money it had promised the Rams if they’d move to St. Louis. PSLs were a new concept then. They’d been brought to the NFL a couple of years earlier by Max Muhleman, a Charlotte, N.C., marketing executive. They were used to help finance a stadium for the expansion Carolina Panthers. The NFL loved it — a new way to get richer by using other people’s money. PSLs were an easier sell than taxpayer financing because they were like user fees: Only the people who actually went to the games had to pay. Of course most new stadiums these days, including the new Busch Stadium in St. Louis, are built with taxpayer money and PSL money, too. In early 1995, FANS Inc. put 46,000 PSLs up for sale and got applications for 73,710. About 53,000 eventually were sold. Most of them were for the cheaper, upper-bowl seats in what would soon become the TWA Dome. But others were for the $4,500 lower-bowl seats. In St. Louis, we’re easy. Most of the money went to the Rams, in one form or another. Part of it paid for Rams Park, the now empty practice facility in Earth City. The lease gives the Rams the option to buy that property for $1 in 2024. If anyone thinks Stan Kroenke won’t try to exercise that option, he hasn’t been paying attention. Even before the Rams’ lease on the stadium, now Edward Jones Dome, hit its 20-year reopener clause, Kroenke was buying property in Inglewood, Calif. It was going to be a Walmart. Sure it was. Meanwhile, as the Rams endured one losing season after another, the bottom fell out of the PSL resale market. The Rams had been selling their own PSLs, creating two classes of PSLs, the original FANS Inc. ones and those sold by the team itself. It turns out the FANS Inc. PSLs have a termination clause in the event the team relocates. The Rams-sold version doesn’t. The judge ruled that fans with the Rams-sold PSLs might be able to apply them in Los Angeles, depriving Kroenke of a few thousand dollars. We can only hope so.

(AFP) UNITED NATIONS, Sept 23, (AP): Iranian President Hassan Rouhani on Thursday joined in opposing a call by US Secretary of State John Kerry to halt all flights over Syria in efforts to get relief shipments through, saying that would only help Islamic radicals gain ground. Rouhani also alleged Washington was sowing fear among financial institutions wanting to do business with his country as part of the sanctions relief due Tehran under a deal with six powers in exchange for curbs on its nuclear program. He spoke on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly a day after the US government gave aviation giants Airbus and Boeing Co the go-ahead to sell aircraft to Iran as part of the landmark deals under the nuclear pact potentially worth some $50 billion. The outgoing administration of President Barack Obama is keen to show that it is honoring the economic terms of the nuclear pact. But Rouhani said permission should have been granted months earlier under terms of the nuclear pact and criticized the “severe delay.” Coming during heated Security Council debate Tuesday, Kerry’s proposal to halt all flights was met with disagreement both in Moscow and even in Washington. Gen Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told Congress any grounding of war planes should exclude American aircraft, and Russia’s deputy foreign minister said grounding flights would make matters worse, a view echoed Thursday by Rouhani. Kerry called for a stop to all flights after an airstrike on a humanitarian aid convoy this week that killed 20 civilians. But Rouhani suggested air strikes remain the best way of attack on Islamic radicals. “If you ground flights,” he said, “you are aiding the terrorists whether you like it or not because the terrorists … are well equipped except for an air force.” Iran strongly backs Assad’s government and Rouhani said the first priority now should be getting aid to those in need. The second must be a continued focus “on the fight against terrorism,” and the third should be “to pave the proper path” to elections including all groups and political parties in Syria, he said Iran complains that international financial sanctions are not being lifted quickly enough under the agreement that stipulates a removal of these and other penalties imposed over Tehran’s nuclear program in exchange for Tehran’s agreement to curb atomic activities that could be used to make a bomb. Tehran says America is to blame, a theme Rouhani sounded both in an earlier speech to the General Assembly and in his comments to reporters.

Sep 23, 2016 Alan Dron | ATW Plus EMAIL Tweet Comments 0 Satellite Love ROB FINLAYSON Advertisement An airline like Virgin Atlantic has, from its inception in 1984, sought to differentiate itself from the perceived formality of flag-carrier rival British Airways by promoting a more relaxed, innovative image. That “fun factor” has frequently involved stunts by airline founder Richard Branson, but there comes a point at which something more is required than having the chairman dress up as a female member of cabin crew or fly around the world in a hot air balloon.  Connectivity gives the airline the opportunity to entertain and inform its passengers, on and off the aircraft. “We’ve got quite a proud heritage of thinking how to keep passengers entertained on board, because all our flights are longhaul,” noted Virgin Atlantic SVP- marketing & customer experience Reuben Arnold. “That need hasn’t really changed, it’s just that there are more options available.” Virgin started rolling out connectivity on its Airbus A330s around five years ago and the entire fleet of A330s, A340s, Boeing 747s and 787s should be fitted with the necessary equipment by the end of this year, with live TV having been brought online just in time to start streaming coverage of the Rio Olympics in early August.  Onboard connectivity in Europe has lagged behind North America, Arnold said, but passenger demands mean that this gap must be closed rapidly. “With connectivity, more and more customers are just expecting to be able to do the same in the air as they do on the ground. Our customers expect Virgin Atlantic to do things slightly differently and to push the boundaries. We’re always looking at ways of keeping customers entertained. What can we do beyond offering internet connection?” Satellite games One such event occurred Christmas 2015, when a satellite link-up allowed two Virgin aircraft on opposite sides of the world—one flying from Shanghai to London, the other from London to San Francisco, to connect to an electronic game that required the two sets of passengers to compete in solving a puzzle. Another was the live streaming of a rock gig on board an inaugural London-Detroit service. One rapidly growing trend is the move by passengers away from the traditional seatback inflight entertainment (IFE) system toward using their own personal electronic devices. Until now, this has tended to mean passengers pre-loading a tablet with downloaded films or television programs; Virgin plans to build on that, as well as breathe new life into IFEs. “In pre-travel communications we will send passengers information about what type of entertainment will be available [on board] and the customer can start to make their own playlist based on that content. That playlist will then be already waiting for them and can be streamed through the IFE to their individual seat or personal device. That’s reasonably straightforward technically,” Arnold said. Connectivity can also be used by passengers to order drinks or duty-free on board, while Virgin crews, like those on several other airlines, are being issued with their own tablets loaded with passenger information so they can provide more personalized service. Virgin Atlantic does not charge for live TV, but does levy a fee for onboard Wi-Fi.  “Take-up has been very good,” Arnold said. “We make sure we price it appropriately. There are a number of options—for one hour or the duration of the flight, for example.” Off the aircraft, Virgin Atlantic has taken a cautious approach to passenger connectivity. “There are relevant times to push offers at customers. That tends to be when they’ve bought a ticket and there are opportunities [for them] to buy additional things,” Arnold explained. “Your travel app helps you get to the airport, through check-in and security. That journey tended to stop when passengers got on board the aircraft. Connectivity enables us to continue the conversation with the customer when they’re on board and at their destination.” To be effective, however, connectivity must be relevant. “We’re very, very selective in the messages we send to customers,” Arnold said. No chatting One aspect of connectivity that has not proved successful is the ability for passengers to make inflight telephone calls. “We do offer voice calls on some of our flights, but … very few people have used them. People prefer to use texts or emails to keep in touch during a flight,” Arnold noted. This usually takes the form of uploading photographs to their social media page while airborne.  Lufthansa has similarly found poor demand for voice calls. Feedback from customers has told the German flag carrier that most passengers do not want the facility to be available. Passengers fear being trapped next to a traveler who talks on the phone for the most of the flight. However, even those people who might want to talk on the phone tend to pass up the opportunity because they do not want their neighbors to overhear their conversations, Lufthansa spokesman Boris Ogursky said. With the Lufthansa app and Bluetooth, a passenger walking through an airport terminal before a flight can be offered lounge access if it is available. At the end of a flight, when passengers switch their mobile phone back on, it will tell them on which carousel they can find their baggage.  Lufthansa has had onboard connectivity on its long-haul flights for some years and plans to introduce it on short-haul European services later this year.  The service is not free, but is available virtually worldwide and is very popular, Ogursky said. Passengers can buy access for varying durations, with a maximum cost of €20 ($22).  Print reprints Favorite EMAIL Tweet Please Log In or Register to post comments.

Photo: Washington State Patrol via AP FBI says it has no evidence the attack was terror-related; too early for motive, say authorities mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 4:00 AM, September 26, 2016 SEATTLE — The authorities have arrested a Turkish-born man yesterday in connection with a deadly shooting at a mall in north-western Washington state the day before, which left five people dead including a teenage cancer survivor. Police named the suspect as Arcan Cetin, 20, a resident of the nearby town of Oak Harbor, and said he was arrested about 24 hours after the killings. The authorities, speaking at a news conference on Saturday night (US local time) said the suspect was taken into custody without incident about 6.30pm. Officials also said they had received numerous tips about the gunman and that surveillance footage had helped locate him. The Federal Bureau of Investigation office in Seattle said it had no evidence the shooting was terror-related. Charges were pending, said the authorities, who also said it was too early to say what led to the shootings. The attack at Cascade Mall in Burlington — about 105km north of Seattle — killed four women in the cosmetics section of a Macy’s department store, said the authorities. A man was critically wounded in the shooting and was taken to Harborview Medical Center in Seattle, where he died. The gunman, who was armed with a rifle, left the scene before the police arrived. Officials said they recovered the weapon at the scene. They declined to give details about the weapon or to say how many rounds had been fired. Photographs of Cetin on a Myspace account showed him holding a handgun and a rifle. Sarai Lara was the youngest of the victims, at 16. The high school sophomore had survived cancer as a young girl. Belinda Galde, 64, and her mother Beatrice Dotson, 95 were also identified as victims of the killing. Another victim is believed by her family to be Shayla Martin, a 52-year-old who worked as a make-up artist at the department store. Chuck Eagan, a longtime Boeing maintenance worker was also killed. At the news conference on Saturday night, Mayor Steve Sexton of Burlington said the shooting happened at a time and in a setting that were ordinary: A Friday night at a mall. Referring to the shooting, he said: “They changed those families forever. It changed our city, I’m afraid to some extent, forever.” Security camera footage showed the man entering the mall without a weapon. Footage taken 10 minutes later showed him entering Macy’s with a rifle. At a news conference earlier on Saturday, the authorities described the tense moments after the shooting, as officers searched the roughly 440,000-square-foot mall for the attacker, finding only store employees and shoppers. Lieutenant Chris Cammock, the commander of the multi-agency response team conducting the investigation told The Seattle Times that Cetin has not been charged and would be booked into the Skagit County Jail. He also said the detectives do not know whether Cetin had a connection with any of the victims and had asked members of the public to continue to stay away from the shopping mall. The FBI said that it had “no information to suggest that additional attacks” were planned in Washington State, and that it was coordinating intelligence efforts with the local authorities. More than 200 officers from at least 26 agencies responded to the shooting, said the authorities. One woman, Ms Tari Caswell, told The Skagit Valley Herald that she had been in the Macy’s women’s dressing room when she heard four loud pops, followed by seven or eight more. “I just stayed quiet in the dressing room because it just didn’t feel right,” she said. “And it got very quiet. And then I heard a lady yelling for help, and a man came and got me and another lady, and we ran out of the store.” The attack was the seventh time this year in which at least four people were killed in a shooting in Washington, according to The Seattle Times. mail print View all comments Tweet Recommended For You   More Stories For You The Most World READ COMMENTED ‘Zombie’ birds fall from sky in Moscow ‘You’re fat’ card prompts London police action ‘Wrong way down the highway’ driver arrested after US crash that killed six ‘Worse than loan sharks’, Pua says of 1MDB paying US$993m for US$3.5b bond guarantee ‘World’s longest flight’ lands in Auckland ‘Post-truth’ named Oxford Dictionaries word of the year ‘Depressed’ De Niro backs anti-Trump protests Zuckerberg sure fake news on Facebook did not sway election Zimbabwean anti-government activists shot at, beaten, abducted Zimbabwe's army chief says military has no role in Mugabe successor Zimbabwe court drops charges against hunter who helped kill Cecil the lion Yemeni government says not interested in Kerry's truce announcement Yemen's Houthis say they want to end war, form unity government Yemen air strike kills 14 in attack on fuel trucks: medics, residents Year-old Paris attack probe sights new suspect, but mastermind elusive Inside Today World Social media’s globe-shaking power Former U.N. chief 'deeply concerned' as Myanmar violence toll jumps U.N. council extends inquiry into Syria toxic gas attacks Tensions boil over in overcrowded Greek migrant camp Danish bishop’s 300-year-old poo offers whiff of history Business Trump opens doors for China in Latin America: Bloomberg View Fiat Chrysler teams up with Amazon to sell cars online Fantasy sports arch rivals DraftKings, FanDuel to merge Wall St. opens flat, indexes near record highs Exclusive: Glencore seeks $550 million to raise stakes in Kurdish oil game Sports Joseph Schooling is home, as packed week awaits From football’s whipping boys to regional heavyweights NZ surprises by hiring Scotsman as sevens coach Experienced defence the key in Lions’ Suzuki Cup bid Want to stay happy and positive?

November 18, 2016 0416 GMT Home Iran Africa Asia Europe International U.S. Middle East Culture Business Health Sport Society Video News ID:169292 Publish Date: Sun, 25 Sep 2016 22:21:40 GMT Service: Iran US air force renewing nukes keep up with China, Russia The US Air Force plans to spend billions of dollars to replace its aging arsenal of intercontinental nuclear missiles in order to keep up with Russia and China, a military official says. The force has nearly 400 intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) mostly of the Minuteman family which were first designed in 1960s, American website Military.com reported Sunday. The decades-old missiles have reportedly been kept in silos built in the 1950s and are difficult to maintain due to a lack of replacement parts. “The Russians, the Chinese, the North Koreans are upgrading all of their systems,” an Air Force official told AFP on condition of anonymity. “They are upgrading all of their legs of the triad -- in that environment, I am not sure it makes sense" to do nothing, the official added. The air force has set aside an $86 billion budget to design a new missile known as the Ground Based Strategic Deterrent (GBSD) which is said to have a 50-year life-cycle. The first GBSD is expected to enter service in late 2020s and the rest will be deployed in the following decade. Initial requests for proposals on the nuclear renewal were issued in July, when the air force asked major weapons manufacturers like Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman and Boeing to put forth their plans. ICBMs are only one part of America’s nuclear “triad,” which also includes submarines and bombers. Altogether, the Pentagon has planned to spend $1 trillion to overhaul its three-pronged nuclear attack force over the next 30 years. The extravagant approach has elicited bipartisan attacks among American politicians, who question the program’s feasibility. "We flat can't afford it. And from a priorities standpoint, it's the wrong priority in the world that we face," Democratic Representative Adam Smith told a forum in Washington last week. He said countries like China and Russia can boast a "spectacular deterrent" with far fewer nuclear warheads. “What they have is enough to say 'Don't screw with us, or we will obliterate you,'” he said, adding that in case of a major nuclear fight, “we're pretty much all toast anyways.”     KeyWords US air force Russia   Comments Comment Name: Email: Comment: Security Key: Latest News NITC: Poland ready for joint venture and development of Iran oil tanker fleet Tehran, Brasilia study economic cooperation expansion Iran attending 2nd World Grain Forum in Russia Iran signs oil MoUs with three Russian giants Japan beats Iran at Asian water polo meet Iran’s Emami wins stage 1 of Tour of Fuzhou Iranian juniors snatch silver, bronze at world taekwondo tourney Iran beats Saudi Arabia in India oil supply drive OPEC moves closer to output deal as Iran gets new offer Tremor shakes western Iran Most Visited Obama vows to veto bill seeking to block Iran plane sales US House renews sanctions on Iran, sets sanctions on Syria Trump not going to ‘hurt’ Clinton www.irandailyonline.com All rights reserved by iran Daily Online Copyright Page Generated in 0/0639 sec

When he got on stage, that was his time’ Half a century after his big brother arrived in London to begin his short career, Leon Hendrix reflects on Jimi’s life and music Leon Hendrix sitting in the flat in which his brother, Jimi, first lived when he moved to London 50 years ago. Photograph: Andy Hall for the Observer Ed Vulliamy Sunday 25 September 2016 13.25 EDT Last modified on Friday 11 November 2016 06.30 EST Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email View more sharing options Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Close This article is 1 month old The eyes have it: immediately, and strikingly, the same as those staring out from the portrait of Jimi Hendrix on the wall. But of course, this is Leon Hendrix, the younger brother of the greatest guitarist of all time, and in London this weekend, 50 years since Jimi arrived in Britain in 1966 to launch his astonishing career. When Jimi Hendrix came to London, he changed the sound of music for ever Read more Leon Hendrix bounded up the stairs of the house in Brook Street, London W1 – which George Frideric Handel had also occupied two centuries earlier – to the top flat in which Jimi lived in 1968 and 69. It is now beautifully decked out to look exactly as it was, a museum and music centre called Handel & Hendrix in London, where Hendrix’s Little Wing is played on the harpsichord in Handel’s music room. Later on Saturday evening, Leon – born six years after Jimi – picked up his own guitar to play his brother’s, and his own, music at the Scotch of St James, the London club where Jimi had played. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Left to right, John Campbell, Daphne Guinness, Leon Hendrix, Mark Arnold and Kevin O’Grady at the Scotch of St James. Photograph: David M. Benett/Dave Benett/Getty Images Leon is slender, intense, and enjoys the inevitable conversation about his brother rather than himself, in the room which Jimi called “the first real home of my own”. Everyone knows the Hendrix childhood was hardly that of a model family – a mother who left, and a father who drank more than he cared. “But Jimi looked after me,” recalls Leon. “For some reason, I never missed a meal. He looked out for me like an elder-brother-father; he made me what you English call ‘tea’ and made sure I was OK. And sometimes, we used to sneak off to Mom’s for dinner.” But where did the music come from? “It’s called inspiration,” says Leon, almost scolding. “As in ‘spirit’, as in ‘in-spirit-ation’. It’s in the wind. I was there when Jimi was a boy, and he’d play with a broom, his first guitar. And Pa would come home and see the straw and shit from the broom on the floor, because Jimi’d been doing acrobatics with his his broom-guitar, and Jimi’d get a whuppin’.” Jimi Hendrix's former London flat to open as a museum Read more According to Leon’s book, Jimi Hendrix: A Brother’s Story, Jimi’s first real instrument was a ukulele the boys found while cleaning out a neighbour’s garage. When he finally got a guitar, Jimi, says Leon, “used to take gold tassels from his Pa’s empty Seagrams 7 bottles and tie them to it. “But the music came from nowhere,” he says. “Music has no body, and I remember when Jimi was playing, he’d try to conjure up the sound with his fingers – where is it?” Once, “when we were little, Jimi took a radio apart, trying to find the music inside it. We lost the screwdriver behind the sofa and couldn’t put it back together, and that was another whuppin’.” Facebook Twitter Pinterest Kathy Etchingham, the former girlfriend of Jimi Hendrix, posing for photographs in his former bedroom, now a museum. Photograph: Leon Neal/AFP/Getty Images Leon says, poignantly, of Hendrix’s soft vocal timbre: “It came from always being told to shut up as a kid. Jimi went inside with his music, and when he got on stage, that was his time”. There is genetic lineage, it turns out, as Leon imparts some new information “My mother’s grandfather was a musician. He was black, but looked so white he was allowed to play, down in Louisiana. He played orchestral music in the 1800s.” However, “my own children want nothing to do with music, they’ve seen what it did to us. My daughter’s in Mexico and my son wants to be a scientist, or a doctor. But I’ve got these grandchildren – and they’re mighty interested. ‘Hey, grandpa, play us that music by uncle Jimi!’ “But in one way”, reflects Leon, “Jimi’s just my brother. When I was little, I thought what he was doing was ordinary stuff. I didn’t even know we were poor, it was just life in the projects.” He remembers Jimi taking him to see Buster Crabbe in 15-minute Flash Gordon films, for a nickel – “that was Jimi’s nickname: ‘Buster’”. Leon has had an interesting life: taken into care at a foster home – where Jimi would visit him – short periods in jail for minor offences, drug problems for which he was successfully treated, and being taken on tour with his brother, during which he got “a share in the chicks backstage”. An accomplished artist, Leon went on to work with the Boeing aerospace company as an expert technical draughtsman. “I thought I was going to be drawing airplanes like Jimi taught me”, he says, “but it was nothing like that. You draw this bolt, or this nut and off it goes to some department and into a bit of machinery. So I quit.” Jimi Hendrix estate sues for return of guitar worth up to $1m Read more Leon was left out of his father Al’s will when he died in 2002, the estate going to Al’s adopted daughter in another marriage, Janie. Leon has initiated serial court cases staking a claim to his brother’s music, as far as the US Supreme Court, which upheld the will. However, another ruling in 2011 granted Leon “rights to his brother’s name and likeness” – though not his music – and there was an undisclosed settlement in 2015. Although the overall loser in this bitter and often sordid battle, Leon says, in his brother’s old flat: “It’s their problem. They’ve made their billions, but I’m happy. I am my brothers brother. So who’s the richest?” Leon launched his musical career “after the age of 50”, he explains, “and it got going after I separated from my Catholic-bird wife”. As the Leon Hendrix Band, he has released two albums, with another on the way, but for this special night at the Scotch, he joins other musicians from a band called Are You Experienced, whose lead guitarist, John Campbell from Birmingham, is not so much a cover or tribute artist as a devotee, says Leon, “whose antennae found my brother’s spirit”. Hendrix, The Who, and others played the Scotch back in the day, and on Saturday night Handel & Hendrix in London booked the now upscale nightclub for a special early-evening commemorative shift. “Let’s play it for Jimi,” said Campbell in broad Brummie, wearing the trademark military parade jacket and an orange sash around his head, launching into Machine Gun and Star Spangled Banner as appropriated by Hendrix. Facebook Twitter Pinterest John Campbell and Leon Hendrix performing at the Scotch. Photograph: David M. Benett/Dave Benett/Getty Images Leon introduced Bob Dylan’s All Along the Watchtower, saying: “Dylan picked up me and my Pa in his limousine, and called this one the song Jimi wrote!” Leon had some trouble remembering the lyrics, apologised, “Sorry Jimi” and confided to his audience: “I like to drink Jack Daniel’s.” So what, they said in the forgiving, happy crowd, it’s Jimi’s brother. Leon had said back at his brother’s flat: “I just move with the spirit, man – where it takes me, I go, and Jimi’s there. He’s my brother and he’s still lookin’ out for me.” And now, at the end of the evening: “God bless you Jimi, for all the times you sent me round the world, following the spirit.” Hendrix wrote his greatest ballad, Angel, for his mother, of whom he saw little. And of course, this was Leon’s mother too, of whom he saw even less. Which made for a cogent solo in Campbell’s rendering, during which Leon took his hands from his own rhythm guitar, removed his glasses and wiped a tear from his eye.

Courtesy of Kohl Children's Museum   By Samantha Nelson Daily Herald Correspondent Fall is here, bringing with it cooler and more unpredictable weather. Luckily these five local museums are helping ease the transition with new exhibits to give you ways to spend the day indoors. 'SpotHero Car Garage' Kohl Children's Museum, 2100 Patriot Blvd., Glenview, (847) 832-6600, kohlchildrensmuseum.org/ Hours: 9:30 a.m. to noon Monday, 9:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. Tuesday through Saturday and noon to 5 p.m. Sunday Admission: $12; $11 for seniors This month, the museum debuted "SpotHero Car Garage," a new version of its permanent "Car Care" exhibit. It not only keeps some of the most popular elements of the original, such as a car wash, pretend car and car ramp, but also adds space for kids to design and test their own cars. Or kids can take on the role of mechanic by checking a vehicle's engine and tires. The new exhibit has extra play cars so kids don't have to wait as long for a turn. Plus, the added components reinforce the museum's focus on science and technology and teaching kids to work together through pretend play. "The car exhibit was very, very popular," said Stephanie Bynum, vice president of programs for Kohl Children's Museum. "(It's) the first exhibit that you see when you come into the museum, and it was a good time to give it a facelift and add some improvements to it," From Wednesday, Sept. 28, to Dec. 30, kids can also visit "Animal Secrets," an exhibit developed by the Oregon Museum of Science and Industry that lets them pretend to be naturalists. They can explore woodlands, a meadow, a stream and a cave, all while learning about the animals that live there such as bats, bears, deer and chipmunks.   Kohl Children's Museum has added extra play cars to its new "SpotHero Car Garage" exhibit so more kids can get in on the action at once. - Courtesy of Kohl Children's Museum "It's a very immersive environment that really lets children connect with nature at a time of year when it's harder to connect with nature as the weather gets colder," Bynum said. "It actually is a great exhibit in the Midwest because there are animals the children will recognize as they're out on nature hikes."   The Illinois Holocaust Museum & Education Center's new exhibit, "Women Hold Up Half the Sky," highlights the struggles women face in other countries and at home. Here, women enrolled in Women for Women International's programs in Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo try to better their situation. - Courtesy of Les Stone 'Women Hold Up Half the Sky' Illinois Holocaust Museum & Education Center, 9603 Woods Drive, Skokie, (847) 967-4800, ilholocaustmuseum.org/ Hours: 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Friday through Wednesday; 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. Thursday, from Sunday, Sept. 25, to Jan. 22 Admission: $12; $8 for seniors and students; $6 for kids 5-11 Based on the book "Half the Sky: Turning Oppression Into Opportunity for Women Worldwide" by Pulitzer Prize-winning authors Nicholas Kristof and Sheryl WuDunn, the exhibit "Women Hold Up Half the Sky" (co-presented by YWCA Evanston/North Shore) explores the challenges women face in the developing world and close to home. Focusing on maternal mortality, sex-trafficking and gender-based violence, the exhibit shares stories of women from around the world. It also highlights the organizations and people who are working to help them such as a victim of human trafficking who became one of the board members of the Chicago Alliance Against Sexual Exploitation. "One of our driving principles is that we want to educate people about the lessons of the Holocaust and how they relate to the present day," said Shoshana Buchholz-Miller, vice president of education and exhibitions for the Illinois Holocaust Museum & Education Center. "We want to shine a light on issues of oppression and inequality and atrocity and genocide in other places. We want to focus on women and girls and the inequity they experience, and how we, as a society, benefit when they have more opportunity."   Saima Muhammad's daughter Javaria is in school and ranked first in her class. Her father, once disdainful of girls, now says, "Girls are just as good as boys." Learn more about challenges women face in the developing world in the Illinois Holocaust Museum & Education Center's new exhibit, "Women Hold Up Half the Sky." - Courtesy of Nicholas D. Kristof The exhibit also provides opportunities for visitors to make a difference. It can be by sending postcards to their senator about legislation supporting victims of domestic violence, sharing what they've learned on social media, and giving money or time to help local organizations. "We really want people to look at this as an opportunity to be inspired to take action," Buchholz-Miller said.   Elmhurst Art Museum's "Blow Up: Inflatable Contemporary Art" features artist Claire Ashley's "Thing Two." - Courtesy of Galleri Urbane Marfa + Dallas, Texas 'Blow Up: Inflatable Contemporary Art' Elmhurst Art Museum, 150 Cottage Hill Ave., Elmhurst, (630) 834-0202, elmhurstartmuseum.org/ Hours: 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. Tuesday through Thursday and Sunday; 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. Friday, now through Nov. 27 Admission: $8; $7 for seniors; free for students and kids younger than 18 See the Midwest premiere of "Blow Up: Inflatable Contemporary Art," which came to Elmhurst from California's Bedford Gallery. The exhibit shows how using air allows artists to create huge sculptures like Lewis deSoto's nearly 30-foot-long and 6.5-foot-tall self-portrait "Paranirvana" and Patrick Flibotte's 18-foot-tall superheroes. There will even be a life-size white elephant on display in the Mies van der Rohe McCormick House. "These are things that you could not explore three dimensionally with any other media," said Elmhurst Art Museum executive director Jenny Gibbs. "If you did it, it would be impossible to move it."   Billie G. Lynn's "White Elephant 1" makes an impression at Elmhurst Art Museum's "Blow Up: Inflatable Contemporary Art" exhibit. - Courtesy of the Elmhurst Art Museum The local version of the exhibit boasts an expanded version of Oak Park artist and School of the Art Institute of Chicago adjunct professor Claire Ashley's installation, with one of the museum's three galleries devoted to her work. "When people think of inflatables, you think of mass-produced vinyl, but she sews hers and they're made of children's backpacks," Gibbs said. "And she's a painter, so I think of these as her 3-D paintings. She's been on my radar for a while, so I'm really happy to have a chance to work with her."   The Museum of Science and Industry's new interactive "Above and Beyond" exhibit allows visitors to explore innovations in aerospace technology. - courtesy of the Museum of Science and Industry 'Above and Beyond' Museum of Science and Industry, 5700 S.

Or just learn to appreciate the science behind flight at the museum's new interactive "Above and Beyond" exhibit. Presented by Boeing in honor of its 100th anniversary, the exhibit starts by sharing the technology that allowed for the first powered flights. It then explores new innovations and research in aviation and aerospace, from motion-sensing technology that simulates the flight of a flock of birds to an elevator that can take people from Earth to the edge of space. Visitors can create and race their own supersonic fighter jets and learn about ways to fly faster and higher. The exhibit also features a mosaic created by Chicago teens depicting the city's skyline and the past, present and future of Boeing aircraft.

Lake Shore Drive, Chicago, (312) 922-9410, fieldmuseum.org/ Hours: 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. daily Oct. 29 to Jan. 13 Admission: $29; $25 for students and seniors; $20 for kids The Field Museum has thousands of artifacts in its permanent Native American galleries. Soon, visitors can view the work of two contemporary Native American artists in the exhibits "Drawing on Tradition: Kanza Artist Chris Pappan" and "Full Circle/Omani Wakan: Lakota Artist Rhonda Holy Bear." Pappan provides a modern version of the ledgers Native American artists drew on in the 19th century when the buffalo hide they traditionally used for art became scarce. Some of his portrait work has also been made into decals that will be added to display cases within the museum's Native American hall. Meanwhile, Holy Bear uses intricately carved and beaded figures to depict 19th-century Plains life. Her work will be displayed alongside objects from the museum's collection that inspired her.

At a news conference, officials said they had not ruled out any possible motives for why 20-year-old Arcan Cetin allegedly shot four women and one man at the Cascade Mall in Burlington Friday evening.   Island County Sheriff’s Lt. Mike Hawley told reporters that he spotted Cetin near the suspect’s home in Oak Harbor, around 30 miles due west of the mall. Hawley said he immediately recognized Cetin as the suspect, turned his patrol car around and arrested Cetin without incident. “He said nothing,” said Hawley, who added that Cetin was unarmed and carrying a computer in a satchel when he was apprehended. “He was kind of zombie-like.” Mount Vernon Police Lt. Chris Cammock said Cetin had immigrated to the U.S. from Turkey and was a “legal permanent resident.” It was not immediately clear when Cetin came to the U.S. Hawley said Cetin had been arrested for simple assault last year, but provided no further details on the case. The Seattle Times reported that Cetin faced three domestic violence assault charges in both Burlington and Island County, with the victim identified as Cetin’s stepfather. The newspaper reports Cetin also was arrested for drunken driving. Court records show Cetin was told by a judge on Dec. 29 that he was not to possess a firearm, the newspaper reported. However, the stepfather urged the judge not to impose a no-contact order, saying his stepson was “going through a hard time.” Cetin was arrested almost exactly 24 hours after his alleged victims were shot at the mall Macy’s makeup counter. The four female victims died in the store. The male victim died early Saturday as police finished sweeping the 434,000-square-foot building. Local media outlets had identified the victims as of early Sunday. One was 16-year-old Sarai Lara, a cancer survivor and high school sophomore. Her mother, Evangelina, told the Seattle Times that through a translator that she was shopping with Sarai and her younger sister, but they split up. She said Sarai went to Macy’s looking for pants. News of the shooting spread through the mall, and Lara tried to get to her daughter but was unable to do so. KIRO-TV identified two more victims as Belinda Galde, 64, and her mother, 95-year-old Beatrice Dotson. The Seattle Times identified the other two victims as Macy’s makeup artist Shyla Martin, 52, and Chuck Eagan, a Boeing maintenance worker who was shot while helping his wife flee the store. “There are people waking up this morning, and their world has changed forever. The city of Burlington has probably changed forever, but I don’t think our way of life needs to change,” Burlington Mayor Steve Sexton said earlier Saturday. “This was a senseless act. It was the world knocking on our doorstep, and it came into our little community.” Surveillance video captured the suspect entering the mall unarmed and then recorded him about 10 minutes later entering the Macy’s with a “hunting type” rifle in his hand, Cammock said. The lieutenant said late Saturday that the rifle was apparently brought into the mall from a suspect vehicle. The weapon was recovered at the scene. “Probably one of the most difficult moments for us last night was knowing that there were family members wondering about their loved ones in there,” Cammock said. Burlington, a community of 8,600 people, is about 65 miles north of Seattle, too far to be a commuter town, but its population swells to 55,000 during the day because of a popular outlet mall, retail stores and other businesses. Burlington is the only major retail center within 30 miles in a region where agriculture is king, said Linda Jones, president of the Burlington Chamber of Commerce. Residents gathered Saturday to comfort each other at a community gathering in a city park. “It’s too scary. It’s too close to home,” said Maria Elena Vasquez, who attended the gathering with her husband and two young children. Joanne Burkholder, 19, of Mount Vernon, was watching the movie “The Magnificent Seven” in the mall’s theater when security guards came in and told them to evacuate immediately. Dozens of panicked moviegoers gathered in the hallway, and Burkholder heard screaming as the officers escorted them to safety in a parking lot. As she drove home later, she had to pull over because she was shaking so hard, she told The Associated Press. “I’m just very thankful for my life this morning. I’ve never been so terrified in my life,” she said Saturday, trying to hold back tears as she attended the community vigil. “You’d think it would happen in Everett or Seattle, but a small town of Burlington, I’d never dream something like this would happen.” People who believed they may have lost loved ones were being sequestered at a church three blocks from the mall, where counselors and a golden retriever therapy dog were present. Dozens of people attended a Saturday evening prayer service for the victims. The gathering was held at Central United Methodist Church in nearby Sedro-Woolley, Wash. The Rev. Cody Natland lit five candles on a table in front of the church, one for each victim. http://www.foxnews.com/us/2016/09/25/suspect-in-washington-state-mall-shooting-in-custody.html Share this: Print Email Share on Tumblr Tweet Pocket Related This entry was posted in News.

We have a Macys and the Cosmetics is near the front door of store. another false flag and innocents died Reply Chili says: September 25, 2016 at 11:05 am Hold on here… The shooter lives 30 miles from the mall? How did he get to the mall and how did he get back ‘near the suspect’s home’? How did the police know who he was and where he lived so fast? Especially when they said they were looking for a hispanic man! WHAT??? Island County Sheriff’s Lt. Mike Hawley told reporters that he spotted Cetin near the suspect’s home in Oak Harbor, around 30 miles due west of the mall. Hawley said he immediately recognized Cetin as the suspect, turned his patrol car around and arrested Cetin without incident. “He said nothing,” said Hawley, who added that Cetin was unarmed and carrying a computer in a satchel when he was apprehended. “He was kind of zombie-like.” How much you want to bet they tell us that the computer has all kinds of jihadi rhetoric and a manifesto as well. They have already shown us he put pictures of himself with guns on social media….sound familiar? This stinks to high heaven as a gov’t op.

Strangely, it seems a rare thing these days for anyone to respect or cherish the truth, or to step up and question the lies that have been deliberately thrown in our faces to test the sheoples’ ambivelance and numbness to reality. But, as Robert the Bruce said in the movie Braveheart: “My Hate Dies with You (them, not you, friend). “No King, But King Jesus” Reply Darzak says: September 25, 2016 at 9:58 pm Definitely a guibermint psy-op.

Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Email this article By Marcus Weisgerber Read bio September 19, 2016 The newly acquired helicopter maker is tapping into Lockheed Martin’s famed advanced tech division. If you ever wondered what Lockheed Martin’s famed Skunk Works might do with a helicopter, stay tuned. Lockheed and Sikorsky had worked together on rotorcraft long before the two companies became one last year, but the helicopter maker now has access to the secretive advanced projects division behind the U-2 spy plane, SR-71 Blackbird, stealth, and more. Now Sikorsky is looking to put some of those new technologies on its current and future helicopters. “One of the areas that we’ve seen some significant opportunities is working with Skunk Works and some of the technologies that they’ve invested heavily on and matching them up with some of the technologies that we’ve invested heavily in,” Sam Mehta, president of Sikorsky’s defense systems and services division, said in an interview on Monday at the Air Force Association’s Air, Space, and Cyber conference. Even when it was part of United Technologies, Sikorsky worked closely with Lockheed on the Navy’s MH-60R Seahawk, a new Air Force rescue helicopter, and the new Marine Corps presidential helicopter.

Over the past decade, Sikorsky’s research into high-speed compound helicopters with coaxial blades produced the X2 experimental helicopter and the larger S-97 Raider. Now the company is using that technology to build the SB-1 Defiant, a compound helicopter it is building with Boeing for an Army demonstration program. “Now we’re talking about mission systems and we’re talking about ways to weaponize that aircraft to give it greater offensive capability,” Mehta said of the SB-1. Previously, Sikorsky would have had to forge a partnering agreement with another company – an oft-lengthy process – to weaponize an aircraft. “Now all the answers I think we need for that technology and for that specific platform lie in our sister companies, and we have ready and full access to those,” Mehta said. Mehta also touted Lockheed’s work in helping Sikorsky install weapons on the Black Hawk helicopter, making that an option for the more than 3,000 helicopters flying around the world. The upgrade is specifically aimed at the thousand-plus Black Hawks flown by U.S. allies. “We can go to a customer now and say, ‘Instead of buying a dedicated attack helicopter, we have the ability to be able to sell you a kit and the ability to be able to provide you a solution for weaponizing you Black Hawk with various levels of integration,’” he said.

Larry Seidman, a rabbi in the southern California community of Irvine, will help the local Jewish community observe Rosh Hashanah, a 10-day period ending on the Day of Atonement, called Yom Kippur, which starts the evening of Oct. 12. Both of these Jewish traditions are rooted deep in the Bible and have been practiced by the Jewish faith dating back 3,000 years. The overriding themes behind these two events on the Jewish calendar are repentance, atonement and forgiveness from sin. Seidman said for Jews, it is a time to reflect on the past year of their lives, think about what they did that was right and wrong, and look to the year ahead with a focus on internal improvement. "We think about what we did the past year as individuals and what made us happy and what made us unhappy in the decision we made, and what changes we can make in the year ahead," said Seidman."The 10-days is meant as a period of reflection." Seidman said the OJC/Beth Shalom Synagogue is the only inclusive synagogue in the Okanagan Valley, so his Rosh Hashanah/Yom Kippur services will reach out to Jewish people of all backgrounds and beliefs. Seidman said he has been to Canada but never to the Okanagan, so he is looking forward to the trip, one that he along with many others were invited by the OJC to apply for. "The word was out there they were looking for a rabbi to visit during (Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur) to hold services and I replied I would be interested as did I think a number of others, and they decided they like me," Seidman said. "I'm looking forward to the opportunity." He said is duties in California also include visiting Jewish people in California's correction service facilities, weddings and funerals, and working with local community service groups. Seidman is a former Boeing aerospace engineer, who transitioned into becoming a full-time rabbi along with his wife Linda, a former NASA aerospace engineer herself who will be co-officiating the services in Kelowna. While the upheaval in the Middle East causes concerns for the state of Israel's safety and the Jewish faith in general, Seidman says it's important for Jews to try and focus what they can do as individuals to help their families and their communities. "We live an imperfect world…but much of what happens in that world is beyond our individual control, but we can control what we say and do as individuals, the charities we support, and to reach out and communicate with rational thinkers who share in an ambition to fix it," he said.       We encourage an open exchange of ideas on this story's topic, but we ask you to follow our guidelines for respecting community standards.

Photo: AFP New Delhi: With the deal for 36 Rafale jets in kitty, Dassault Aviation CEO Eric Trappier on Friday said the French company is open to manufacture the fighter aircraft in India if the plane is shortlisted for a bigger order. He said that with the Indian contract going through, the company feels that more international orders of the plane, capable of carrying nuclear weapons, will come in. “It is 36 at the moment. We feel that we can create a strong industrial partnership in India. We know very well the large number of aircraft that the IAF needs,” Trappier said in an interview to PTI in New Delhi. He said that Dassault Aviation, manufacturer of the Rafale jets, is committed to the Make in India initiative. “Yes, of course. We will see how we can carry forward with the ‘Make in India’ initiative. We are open to manufacturing Rafales in India,” Trappier said when asked if the French firm was willing to manufacture the fighter aircraft in India if the plane was shortlisted for a bigger order. Also Read: India signs $8.9 billion Rafale fighter jet deal with France The CEO said the company will work with the Indian Air Force (IAF) and the government to see how they can meet India’s needs. He said the focus was to build an industrial partnership in India for Rafale jets and the 50% offset clause will be of help. Defence sources have made it clear that the deal for 36 Rafale jets does not come with an option clause. This means that more orders will come only through fresh talks. India had originally wanted 126 medium multi-role combat aircraft for which Rafale was shortlisted. However, due to the delay over cost and other issues, the Narendra Modi government decided to go for 36 Rafale jets in fly away condition. With India reducing the number, a multi-billion dollar aircraft contract is still in play. This has led to fresh pitches from those who lost out on the first deal including Boeing, Saab and Lockheed Martin. Also Read: Rafale fighter jet deal comes with 50% offset clause The sources have said India is looking at shortlisting one more aircraft, besides Tejas, to be manufactured domestically. Dassault Aviation hopes that Rafale, a twin-jet fighter aircraft able to operate from both an aircraft carrier and a shore base, makes the cut. The fully versatile Rafale is able to carry out all combat aviation missions — air defence, interception, ground support, in-depth strikes, reconnaissance, anti-ship strikes and nuclear deterrence. Rafale entered service with the French Navy in 2004 and with the French Air Force in 2006. In 2015, Egypt and Qatar ordered 24 Rafales each. As of 30 June this year, 152 Rafale aircraft had been delivered.

Written by Sushant Singh | New Delhi | Updated: September 24, 2016 3:01 pm Rafale deal: PM Narendra Modi looks on as Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar and his French counterpart Jean-Yves Le Drian exchange documents of MoUs on the purchase of Rafale combat jets, at Hyderabad House in New Delhi. File/Express photo/Renuka Puri When the Prime Minister of a country personally announces a deal for a fighter aircraft in a foreign land, there can be no doubt that the deal will eventually be signed. That there were still doubts about the fate of the Rafale deal – suddenly announced by PM Narendra Modi in Paris in April last year – is a testimony to the level of confidence we have on our defence procurement system. But 17 months down the line, and for Rs 59,000 crore, the deal is finally done. India gets 36 Rafale fighters, the first one within 36 months and the entire complement within 67 months. There is no clause for a follow-up deal – usual practise is for 50 per cent of the contracted quantity to be bought on terms of the original contract — which means that if India wants to buy more Rafales, it will have to enter into a fresh negotiation with France. A fresh negotiation is always a scary proposition as seen from the Rafale deal itself. The IAF first mooted the idea in 2000 for new fighter aircraft to replace the MiGs, which were to go out of service, till HAL made the indigenous Tejas. The tender issued in 2007 was for 126 aircraft, and that number is important: 126 fighters mean eight squadrons. IAF wants 45 fighter squadrons to ward off a two-front collusive threat, and it is authrorised 42 squadrons. It currently has only 32, and the airworthiness and vintage of fighters in these squadrons is not satisfactory. IAF told the parliamentary standing committee that at this rate, it will be down to 25 squadrons by 2022. That is a scary scenario.

He has put all his weight behind the Tejas but it is an unproven fighter, with production facilities still not in place. Beyond the first squadron, there is no guarantee about induction of Tejas fighters. Also Read: Air Force’s 16-year wait over, Rafale deal done Meanwhile, SAAB, Boeing and Lockheed Martin have submitted their proposals for respectively making the Gripen, F-18 and F-16 in India. Reports suggest that their proposals are being evaluated by the IAF and the ministry. There is no idea as to when any of these proposals will be approved and when their first aircraft will be made available to India. But the IAF squadron strength will continue to deplete with every passing year. Rafale is not a bad deal for India. IAF needed an aircraft for the nuclear strike role to replace the French Mirages and Rafale is the best option. By all yardsticks, we negotiated hard to get the best possible price. It is understandable then that the Indian side would have popped the bubbly for the Rafale deal. But let us put an end to the celebrations, and focus on the real task ahead: building up the IAF to an adequate strength. © The Indian Express Online Media Pvt Ltd Best of Express 26/11 Stories of Strength presented by The Indian Express, Facebook & Instagram IndiaBanks to work normal hours on Saturday, but only senior citizens can exchange old notes IndiaDemonetisation: Misuse of bank account for black money deposit to invite govt action IndiaLong queues outside banks a ‘serious issue’, says SC on demonetisation IndiaDemonetisation: Cash against debit swipe takes off at 700 petrol pumps IndiaNavy rubbishes Pak Navy claim that it stopped Indian submarine from entering waters EntertainmentForce 2 movie review: John Abraham, Sonakshi Sinha film is Bond-Bourne rehash EntertainmentChris Martin parties with Shah Rukh Khan, Sussanne Khan and Sridevi's daughters, see inside pics EntertainmentIt's November 18, Salman Khan's wedding day, see pics EntertainmentIulia Vantur reveals what she had to sacrifice to live in India.

This large body of work is handled by the office’s 42 members, comprised of 24 full-time attorneys and 18 support staffers.  Each year, their work includes thousands of criminal cases and hundreds of complaints from consumers, tenants and code enforcement personnel.  They defend the City and its workers in an average of about 200 civil matters in the state and federal trial and appellate courts.  The cases range in complexity from straight forward trip and fall claims to civil rights and employment claims to complex constitutional challenges to City laws and policies.  They also prepare or review thousands of contracts, leases and licenses, draft dozens of ordinances, provide advice at countless public and staff meetings, provide training to various groups and constantly monitor public process and transparency issues and conflict issues. “For over two decades, our City has been extremely fortunate to have Marsha leading our legal work. The combination of her deep knowledge of the law, commitment to our complex community and her savvy leadership, has helped shape the vibrant, innovative and diverse city we have today,” said Mayor Tony Vazquez. “We have all benefitted from her absolute dedication to the public process. She will be missed.” As with other areas of the City’s work, the City’s legal work often includes unique issues and challenges.  “I am proud of the work the office has done over the years to promote community welfare by effectuating Council’s laws and policies, including those relating to housing, tenants’ rights, homelessness, consumer protection, and land use, among others,” said Moutrie.  “Like the City as a whole, the office takes on big   million from the major oil companies and other polluters. We did the legal work to defeat a state take back of about $200 million in redevelopment funds, preserving it for meeting local needs. We drafted and defended laws that promote affordable housing and ensure shared use of our treasured public space, and those laws were adopted as models by other cities. These are just a few examples of how this team has earned its state- wide reputation of outstanding legal work.” Some of the most notable accomplishments of the City Attorney’s Office since 1994 include: Litigated against major oil companies who polluted City wells with MTBE; advanced legislation that caused statewide, and later national, phase out of MTBE; recovered $275 million from all major oil companies; later recovered and additional $108 million for PCP/TCE contamination of groundwater by Boeing and Gillette/Proctor and Gamble. The City Attorney’s Office received the ABA State and Local Government Achievement Award, recognizing best public law office in the country for this work. (City of Santa Monica v. Shell)  Only city attorney’s office in the country to challenge deceptive practices in the bullion/gold sales industry; recovered $10 million for victims.  Drafted and successfully defended a law regulating events in public spaces for the purpose of ensuring reasonable, shared use; it was challenged on First Amendment grounds, upheld in federal court and became a model for other cities. (Santa Monica Food Not Bombs v. City of Santa Monica)  Drafted and defended the Affordable Housing Production Program law. That law became a model for other cities. Performed transactional work necessary to produce over 1900 affordable units.  Recovered a total of $2.5 million for consumers in four recent cases challenging unfair billing and other unfair practices of businesses selling goods and services within the City. Litigated through the California Supreme Court Harris v. City of Santa Monica, which changed California reemployment discrimination law.  Lawyers representing both sides were jointly given California Lawyer of the Year Award. Protected Tenants rights by drafting, defending and enforcing local laws, e.g., laws prohibiting harassment and requiring relocation payments. (Action Apartment v. City of Santa Monica)  Protected the beach/ocean, public health and the environment by drafting and publicizing laws against smoking and use of reusable plastic bags.  Protected low wage immigrant workers against wage violations by car washes; recovered $656,000 in back wages.  Preserved public property for public benefit through resolution of long-standing beach encroachment disputes with private owners through negotiation and litigation.  (City of Santa Monica v. Ornstein)  Protected local quality of life in residential neighborhoods by prosecuting clubs that fail to observe noise limitations and other local regulations.  Drafted, successfully defended and enforced laws that address impacts of homelessness (Doucette v. City of Santa Monica).  Helped establish and operate Homeless Court as a diversion program to help persons long homeless in the community to get off the streets; program has permanently housed 70 persons. Worked to break the cycle of violence by prioritizing prosecution of domestic violence cases, prosecuting them vertically, and working closely with local serve providers to aid victims. Provided all legal work necessary to support City’s various public works and public programs, e.g., Main Library, Pico Branch Library, Virginia Avenue Park, Annenberg Beach House, Tongva Park, Expo Light Rail,  Esplanade, California Incline,  programs for seniors and youth, after-school programs, senior programs, arts programs, after-school programs, and human services grants. Drafted and successfully defended against constitutional challenge laws that regulate street performance and street vending in order to respect individual rights while protecting shared enjoyment and aesthetics of public space. (Lamle v. City of Santa Monica)  Successfully resolved difficult and lengthy dispute involving religious displays in a public park through ordinance drafting and litigation. (Santa Monica Nativity Scenes Committee v. City of Santa Monica) “Losing Marsha Moutrie, even into her well-earned retirement, which we knew was inevitable, is a challenging transition for our City,” said Councilmember Kevin McKeown. “I’m grateful we enjoyed her excellent leadership for so many years, and grateful she leaves us such a highly skilled and motivated staff of attorneys to continue handling our legal workload while we seek a replacement. We will find a new City Attorney, but never another Marsha Moutrie.” The Council is expected to begin its search for a new City Attorney next week.   Post a comment Name E-Mail City Comments Comments Comments Advertise With Us For the best in Santa Monica advertising opportunities, click here!

It also slammed the EU for failing to rein in billions of dollars in illegal subsidies, despite being told to do so. Four EU member states - France, Germany, Spain and Britain - had not complied with WTO calls to phase out subsidies, the intergovernmental trade body said. The dramatic ruling has set the stage for the United States to seek up to $10bn (€8.9bn) in annual trade tariffs on EU imports, according to Boeing. It's the latest step in a more than decade-old trade spat between rivals Airbus and Boeing, pitting the European Union against the US. The Obama Administration hailed the decision an "important victory". US trade representative Michael Froman called on the EU, Germany, France, the UK and Spain "to respect WTO rules". "We have long maintained that EU aircraft subsidies have cost American companies tens of billions of dollars in lost revenue, which this report clearly proves. We will not tolerate our trading partners ignoring the rules at the expense of American workers and their families." In a blow to Europe's long-held argument that Airbus' most recent jet, the A350, fell outside the case, the WTO said funding for it had been subsidised, but rejected US claims that it fell into the most serious category of "prohibited" aid. Boeing executive vice president and general counsel J Michael Luttig said that "the day of reckoning for launch aid has finally arrived", adding: "The World Trade Organisation has now found that Airbus is and always has been a creature of government and of illegal government subsidy." The case is the biggest to go before the WTO. It began in 2006, when the US government brought a claim to the WTO against the EU, alleging unfair state support for Airbus. Since then, both sides have won and lost complaints filed against one another. Boeing's chairman and chief executive, Dennis Muilenburg, said the "historic ruling finally holds the EU and Airbus to account for their flouting of global trade rules. This long-awaited decision is a victory for fair trade worldwide and for US aerospace workers, in particular." However, the win is likely to be short-lived for Boeing, as the WTO is due to make another ruling, which is expected to fault the US for indirect subsidies to Boeing through, among other things, state tax breaks. The EU has suggested it will appeal the WTO findings, saying it found some of the report "unsatisfactory. "We are closely analysing the report," the European Commission said. Airbus, for its part, claimed it conformed with most global trade commitments and denied that it broke WTO rules. "We only needed to make limited changes in European policies and practices to comply," a spokesman said. "The US started this dispute claiming Airbus was receiving illegal subsidies, but the WTO decided otherwise. "We did what we needed to do and did it in the agreed timeframe. Airbus and its European partners met their obligations to withdraw any subsidy elements or eliminate adverse effects. Airbus wants common sense to prevail. Whatever Boeing will say, nobody will have to go to the bank. There have never been any repayments and there never will be, it is not in the spirit of WTO."

NEW YORK: Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif on Thursday sought preferential trade access to the US market to boost bilateral trade between Pakistan and the United States. "We seek preferential trade access to the US market so that Pakistan and US businesses get a fair chance of doing business with each other. Such an arrangement is necessary to boost bilateral trade," the prime minister said while speaking at a luncheon co-hosted by the US-Pakistan Business Council (USPBC) and the US Chamber of Commerce. He expressed hope that the US Chamber of Commerce and the USPBC would play their role in bringing the two countries closer on this and in convincing the US administration and Congress for its need. "This will go a long way in strengthening the relationship between the two countries, their people and businesses," he added. The prime minister said he firmly believed that a strong trade and economic relationship was an essential pre-requisite for a stable, long-term people to people relations. The United States has remained an important economic and trading partner of Pakistan, he said, adding, this partnership has been beneficial for private businesses of both countries and instrumental in fostering growth in Pakistan. "However, the level of trade and investment between the two countries has not kept pace with global trends," he said and mentioned that recognising this, both President Obama and he agreed in their meeting in October 2013 to jointly work on developing a Joint Action Plan to expand bilateral trade and investment flows over the next five years. "I see tremendous potential to deepen trade, economic and investment cooperation between our two countries. Your role as business leaders, investors and entrepreneurs is critical in enabling our two governments to fully harness the potential," he added. He said turning around the economy, overcoming the energy crisis, combating extremism and terrorism and investing in education have been the key priorities of his government ever since assuming office in June 2013. "I am, therefore, particularly pleased to share with you the details of the progress achieved by Pakistan," he added. The prime minister said as a result of bold economic reforms, his government had achieved significant improvement in all major economic indicators. Pakistan's growth has increased and the budget deficit has been reduced, he added. He said with a young and vibrant population of 200 million, growing consumer demand, as well as a stable economy and improved security, Pakistan offered enormous opportunities for profitable investment and trade. Giving an overview of some of the key economic indicators in Pakistan, the prime minister said inflation is now well below 3% - the lowest in 47 years. The State Bank of Pakistan in its Monetary Policy Decision announced in May 2016 decreased the discount rate to 5.75% - again lowest in last 4 decades, he said, adding that upgradation of the Karachi Stock Exchange to Emerging Market Index by Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI) was an important development. The Boeing International Operations and Policy director expressed his desire that Boeing wanted to partner with PIA and was ready to offer 777 and 787 planes for PIA Premier Service through transparent and competitive process. The Proctor and Gamble Selling and Marketing Operations president said that the company has already achieved 20 percent increase in its growth in Pakistan. "We are ready to further invest $100 million in Pakistan." Besides US Chamber executive vice president, senior vice president of US Chamber of Commerce and USPBC president, Pepsi Co vice chairman, Motorolla Solutions senior vice president, APR Energy chairman, Citi Bank vice chairman, Visionnet Systems CEO, EPC executive vice president, Metlife associate general counsel, McLarty Associates senior adviser and Agilvy Public Northrop Grumman CEO were prominent attendees during the occasion.  Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus E-Paper Aaj Kal Sunday Magazine Facebook Daily Times Instagram Twitter Tweets by @DailyTimes_DT SoundCloud sunday magazine aaj kal Business Plus TGIF Zaiqa TV Company Financials Contact us Privacy Policy TERMS AND CONDITIONS © 2016 Dailytimes - ALL RIGHTS RESERVED Powered By opustech.co

The stealthy fighter, featuring advanced radar, electronic warfare and an internal weapons bay, is expected to play a key role in Japan's elevated security posture. JASDF ordered the F-35 after the unveiling in China of the Chengdu J-20, a new fighter with a stealthy profile in development for the People's Liberation Army Air Force. "As the security environment surrounding Japan has become increasingly severe, because of its excellence, it is very significant for the defense of Japan to commit to acquiring the F-35 year by year," Kenji Wakamiya, Japan's State Minister of Defence told an audience at Lockheed's production facilities in Fort Worth. Lockheed will build the first four Japanese jets in Fort Worth, AX-1 through AX-4, while Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI) will produce the remaining 38 under license at its Nagoya facility. MHI, which built Tokyo's fleet of Boeing F-15Js under license, won the 2011 competition to build the F-35A. In December, MHI began work on the first F-35A assembled in Japan, dubbed the AX-5. Work at the Nagoya facility involves the mating of the aircraft's wings, fuselage and tail, replicating Lockheed's process in Fort Worth and Leonardo's final assembly and check out facility for the F-35 in Italy.

Hammett and Amy R. Connolly   |   Sept. 25, 2016 at 10:04 AM Follow @upi Comments 1 of 2 BURLINGTON, Wash., Sept. 25 (UPI) -- A 20-year-old man who was found wandering the streets in a "zombie-like" state is being held on five counts of first-degree murder in the shootings death of five people at a Washington mall. Arcan Cetin is being held on no bail. He was turned over to the Skagit County Sheriff's Office, Island County authorities confirmed. Authorities have yet to identify a motive, said Sgt. Mark Francis of the Washington State Patrol. Cetin, booked in to the Skagit County Jail, will likely make his first court appearance on Monday. His family is cooperating with police, officials said. Using surveillance video and tips from the public, the Oak Harbor, Wa., man was arrested after authorities spotted him walking along a street, the Seattle Times reported. It was the result of a 20-hour manhunt. RELATEDMassive manhunt underway for Seattle-area mall shooter who killed 5 The shooter can be seen on surveillance video walking in to the mall Friday night unarmed about 10 minutes before the shooting, KOMO.com reported. Police believe he went back to the car to retrieve a rifle. Police and emergency medical personnel responded quickly, bringing bomb-sniffing dogs and a helicopter to surround the mall, but the suspect had already fled on foot. He was first reported to be a Hispanic male. The shootings occurred just before 7 p.m. local time Friday at the mall, about 65 miles north of Seattle -- and just 45 miles south of the U.S.-Canada border. When Cetin was spotted Saturday, police moved in. "As we were driving by, I see the fella walking across the street and I go, 'Oh, that's him,'" said Lt. Mike Hawley, of the Island County Sheriff's Office. "So, I whipped a real quick U-turn and hit the lights, pulled my gun and he was under arrest." Hawlin said Cetin was almost "like a zombie," and was unarmed. "I said, 'you're under arrest' and he didn't say much -- well, he didn't say anything at all," Hawley said. "He was carrying a little leather satchel with a computer in it and that's about it. He didn't say much at all." Cetin has a record of domestic violence against his step father and was told by a judge in December 2015 not to possess a firearm. He emigrated to the United States from Turkey when he was a child and was a local high school graduate, The youngest of the mall shooting victims, Sarai Lara, was 16. The Mount Vernon High School sophomore, known as a happy, responsible student who had survived cancer as a young girl, was shopping at the mall with her mother, Evangelina Lara, and a younger sister. They split up to go to different stores. Sarai went to Macy's, then the shooting occurred. Her mother said she tried to get to Sarai, but was blocked from entering the shooting scene. "I never expected this to happen to someone that I knew and that I cared about," said Sarai Lara's friend, Rachel Marsh. A family member identified Belinda Galde, 64, and her mother, Beatrice Dotson, 95, also as shooting victims. Galde, a longtime probation officer, was remembered as a caring person. "She was an amazingly kind and caring individual who was much adored by her friends, her coworkers and the thousands of probationers who she helped find a better way to live.," the Skagit County court said in a statement. Shayla Martin, a 52-year-old Macy's makeup artist, also was shot. Karen Van Horn, Martin's sister who is an employee at The Herald in Everett, described her as an avid reader who was both classy and practical. "She was so sweet," Van Horn said.. "She was just very independent. She wanted to make her own way. She didn't want to rely on anyone else." Chuck Eagan, a longtime Boeing maintenance worker from Lake Stevens, was also a victim, according to his aunt, Carol Thrush. She said Eagan and his wife had gone out to dinner and to the mall to shop and had made their way to Macy's when the shooter began his rampage. Thrush said Eagan and his wife began running, but his wife fell down as the two tried to get away. When Eagan stopped to help his wife, he was shot, Thrush said.

Four of the Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System E-8 aircraft were grounded recently for inspection at Robins. There are 17 planes in the J-STARS program, 16 for missions and one for training to coordinate forces in various locations worldwide. “Four aircraft recently delivered from depot are being inspected for any possible safety of flight issues,” an Air Force spokesman said in a news release Saturday. “(Air Force Materiel Command) is concerned about a trend of mishaps, mostly minor but at least one significant, that appear associated with the Northrop Grumman Lake Charles Maintenance and Modification Center that performs depot maintenance on the E-8 fleet.” The release noted that the “significant mishap” was related to water being in an area of the plane where it wasn’t supposed to be, resulting in equipment damage. All inspections were expected to be completed by Saturday, and those inspections would also help determine if other J-STARS planes need similar inspections. Also on Saturday, U.S. Senator Johnny Isakson, R-Ga., released a statement about the maintenance issues. Isakson has been part of the push to speed up funding of a new fleet of J-STARS planes to replace those currently in use. “This news is further evidence of the instability and the urgent need for recapitalization to be a higher priority for the Air Force,” Isakson said in the release. Northrop Grumman is also one of three companies, along with Boeing and Lockheed Martin, that are attempting to bid for the estimated $6.5 billion contract to produce the new J-STARS planes, according to a recent story by Defense News. ——— ©2016 The Macon Telegraph (Macon, Ga.)

Sarai was shopping at the mall with her mother and sister on Friday night, and they split up to look in different stores. She was in Macy's by herself when the shooting broke out.

One of her friends spoke to KOMO News and explained, "She was a strong girl, she told me a lot about her life and I trusted her with everything. She gave me advice and helped me through a lot." She was described by her mother Evangelina as a "happy, responsible, and driven student." A mother and daughter were also among the victims of the shooting.

Approximately 50 community members gathered at the Central United Methodist Church in Sedro-Woolley, Washington on Saturday evening, where they lit candles and offered their prayers for the five victims.

Arcan Cetin is being held on no bail. He was turned over to the Skagit County Sheriff's Office, Island County authorities confirmed. Authorities have yet to identify a motive, said Sgt. Mark Francis of the Washington State Patrol. Cetin, booked in to the Skagit County Jail, will likely make his first court appearance on Monday. His family is cooperating with police, officials said. Using surveillance video and tips from the public, the Oak Harbor, Wa., man was arrested after authorities spotted him walking along a street, the Seattle Times reported. It was the result of a 20-hour manhunt. RELATEDMassive manhunt underway for Seattle-area mall shooter who killed 5 The shooter can be seen on surveillance video walking in to the mall Friday night unarmed about 10 minutes before the shooting, KOMO.com reported. Police believe he went back to the car to retrieve a rifle. Police and emergency medical personnel responded quickly, bringing bomb-sniffing dogs and a helicopter to surround the mall, but the suspect had already fled on foot. He was first reported to be a Hispanic male. The shootings occurred just before 7 p.m. local time Friday at the mall, about 65 miles north of Seattle -- and just 45 miles south of the U.S.-Canada border. When Cetin was spotted Saturday, police moved in. "As we were driving by, I see the fella walking across the street and I go, 'Oh, that's him,'" said Lt. Mike Hawley, of the Island County Sheriff's Office. "So, I whipped a real quick U-turn and hit the lights, pulled my gun and he was under arrest." Hawlin said Cetin was almost "like a zombie," and was unarmed. "I said, 'you're under arrest' and he didn't say much -- well, he didn't say anything at all," Hawley said. "He was carrying a little leather satchel with a computer in it and that's about it. He didn't say much at all." Cetin has a record of domestic violence against his step father and was told by a judge in December 2015 not to possess a firearm. He emigrated to the United States from Turkey when he was a child and was a local high school graduate, The youngest of the mall shooting victims, Sarai Lara, was 16. The Mount Vernon High School sophomore, known as a happy, responsible student who had survived cancer as a young girl, was shopping at the mall with her mother, Evangelina Lara, and a younger sister. They split up to go to different stores. Sarai went to Macy's, then the shooting occurred. Her mother said she tried to get to Sarai, but was blocked from entering the shooting scene. "I never expected this to happen to someone that I knew and that I cared about," said Sarai Lara's friend, Rachel Marsh. A family member identified Belinda Galde, 64, and her mother, Beatrice Dotson, 95, also as shooting victims. Galde, a longtime probation officer, was remembered as a caring person. "She was an amazingly kind and caring individual who was much adored by her friends, her coworkers and the thousands of probationers who she helped find a better way to live.," the Skagit County court said in a statement. Shayla Martin, a 52-year-old Macy's makeup artist, also was shot. Karen Van Horn, Martin's sister who is an employee at The Herald in Everett, described her as an avid reader who was both classy and practical. "She was so sweet," Van Horn said.. "She was just very independent. She wanted to make her own way. She didn't want to rely on anyone else." Chuck Eagan, a longtime Boeing maintenance worker from Lake Stevens, was also a victim, according to his aunt, Carol Thrush. She said Eagan and his wife had gone out to dinner and to the mall to shop and had made their way to Macy's when the shooter began his rampage. Thrush said Eagan and his wife began running, but his wife fell down as the two tried to get away. When Eagan stopped to help his wife, he was shot, Thrush said.
