The airline giant has reportedly taken the step to bring it 'into line' with competitors, even though the average waistline of passengers is expanding. The company is set to add an extra 52 seats to its Boeing 777s at Gatwick from 2018, and plans to “densify” aircraft at Heathrow after that, it is said. Currently passengers will find nine economy seats in each row in the 777s. But from 2018, there will reportedly be 10 seats fitted within the same space. The move would increase the population on board flights by up to a fifth and stretch current facilities further. The number of toilets is currently 11, allowing for one for every 25 passengers. The latest move will bring that up to one for every 30 passengers, reports The Independent. Read More Are crying babies the worst thing on a flight? This airline may have just changed all that However, one upside is that BA says the economy cabin will be fitted with new entertainment systems with bigger screens. Willie Walsh, chief executive of BA’s parent company IAG, told investors at a Capital Markets Day: “We’re responding to a market opportunity.” The airline giant is said to have taken the step even though the average waistline of passengers is expanding (Photo: REUTERS) He said the move would allow BA to “lower the average cost per seat, charge a lower price and stimulate demand”. A British Airways spokesman told Mirror Online: "We are flying more customers than ever before to our expanding network of destinations. "To meet this demand, we are updating our 777 cabins to bring us into line with many of our competitors and allow us to offer even more low fares.

"British Airways continues to offer customers a generous hand baggage allowance and complimentary food and drink on all our long-haul services." Among the other airlines with a 10-abreast configuration are Air New Zealand, Emirates and Air France. EasyJet’s A320 airbus offers 18-inch wide seats - while BA lags behind at 17.3ins (Photo: PA) British Airways will also reportedly add 12 extra seats on its short-haul Airbus A320 from Heathrow -which will increase the planes seating density to match easyJet's. The move come after BA increased its seat width from 16.8ins to 17.3 ins on its new Dreamliner fleet last year. The move followed complaints from travellers, with at least one claiming they did not have enough room to open the cutlery pack with their meal. However, the firm still hasn't caught up with some of its rivals. EasyJet’s A320 airbus and Thomson’s Boeing 767-300ER also offer 18-inch wide seats and even no-frills Ryanair gives wriggle space of 17 inches on its 737-800 aircraft.

Deputy Director-General of Uzbekistan Gennadiy Kharlap, Deputy Directors of Aviation Enterprise Uzbekistan Airways Technics Andrey Margachev and Valeriy Kosov received the plane at the Boeing facility. Pilots Andrey Tyan, co-pilo Yuriy Gorkov and chief navigator of the airline Stanislav Gurfinkel carried out 12-hour flight to bring the airplane from Seattle to Uzbekistan. A solemn ceremony of meeting of the airplane was held in Tashkent with participation of the officials of the state bodies. Uzbekistan Havo Yollari received the first Boeing-787 Dreamliner airplane on 31 August. The airline started commercial exploitation on 5 September. It carried out first international flight to Almaty, Kazakhstan, on 9 September. The Boeing 787 Dreamliner is a long-range, mid-size wide-body, twin-engine jet airliner developed by Boeing Commercial Airplanes. It seats 250 to 330 passengers, depending on the variant. Boeing states that it is the company’s most fuel-efficient airliner and the world’s first major airliner to use composite materials for most of its construction. According to Boeing, the 787 consumes 20% less fuel than the similarly-sized 767. Uzbekistan Havo Yollari and Boeing signed a contract on purchase of two airlines of Boeing-787-800 Dreamliner and additional engine. The cost of the contract is US$246.4 million. Fund for Reconstruction and Development of Uzbekistan (FRDU) issued a loan for US$223.2 million to finance the contract. Subscribe to our Telegram channel to keep in touch with latest news.

The move is being marketed as necessary to catch up with other competitors and save costs. Offering decent legroom and elbow space has become a top priority for carriers flying long-haul destinations, but efforts to lower the average cost per seat is literally putting a squeeze on economy class passengers.  British Airways will add 52 extra seats to its Boeing 777s starting from 2018, meaning each row will have ten seats instead of nine like BA’s current economy class seating layout, according to the Independent.  BA announces at IAG Capital Markets Day 25 Boeing 777s will move from 9-10 seats a row in World Traveller & more seats on short-haul aircrft pic.twitter.com/U6QFe5T2C9— LondonAirTravel (@LondonAirTravel) 4 ноября 2016 г. At present, all Boeing 777s operated by the UK’s flag carrier have nine economy seats abreast, carrying up to 299 passengers in all class configurations. “We are updating our 777 cabins to bring us into line with many of our competitors,” said a British Airways spokesperson, as cited by the Independent. According to the Airline Reporter, other major carriers using a 10-abreast setup on Boeing 777s include Emirates, Air France, American Airlines, Japan’s ANA, and Korean Air. Even Singapore Airlines, ranked third in the prestigious 2016 World’s Top 100 Airlines list, has ten seats in each row.  Read more Spacious & narrow: Airbus designs adjustable ‘bench seat’ for obese passengers, families Willie Walsh, the CEO of BA’s parent company International Airline Group (IAG), said: “We’re responding to a market opportunity,” adding that the move will allow the British flag carrier to “lower the average cost per seat, charge a lower price and stimulate demand.”  British Airways is also planning to add 12 extra seats on its short-haul Airbus A320 aircraft flying from Heathrow, making the planes almost as densely packed as those operated by Britain’s low-cost airline EasyJet. However, BA said the new seats on ‘Triple Sevens’ would be fitted with bigger screens and upgraded in-flight entertainment systems. Airlines across the world are competing for passenger traffic on short and long-haul routes by trying to reduce operational costs, sometimes at the expense of customer-friendly options. Earlier in April, American Airlines, United, and Delta announced that they would apply tiered pricing to all economy seats, meaning that passengers may be charged extra for choosing window or aisle seats. Some carriers, like Uzbekistan Airways, even considered weighing passengers and their hand luggage before boarding, citing “in-flight safety requirements” introduced by the International Air Transport Association (IATA), but the organization said it has no such regulations.

View Comments President John Magufuli said this during his first address to members of the press. He added that negotiations with the manufacturer are going on and further talks are set for next month. “We have allocated 10 million US dollars (21.80bn/) as advance payment for a new Boeing,” Dr Magufuli said, adding that three more aircraft are also scheduled to arrive anytime in June, next year. He detailed that the new fleet, which is tailored to revive the nation’s flag carrier, includes two SC 300 jets with up to 300 passenger seats and one Bombardier Dash 8400. The plan, according to the president, is designed to transform the nation’s infrastructure and to spur development through industries and tourism. According to President Magufuli, Tanzania is not performing well in the tourism industry. Citing Morocco, the president said the far northern African country registered 10.3 million arrivals last year and expects about 14 million this year, while Tanzania was still struggling with only two million tourist arrivals. He explained that the government commitments on improving infrastructure is undisputed. “We allocated 1trn/- for the construction of the central railway line at standard gauge. The tender for construction has already attracted more than 40 firms. The project will start from Dar es Salaam to Morogoro in the first phase and will be funded by the government,” he noted. He went on detailing that the government’s plan to shift its administration capital to Dodoma will also open up new tourism attraction sites. As strategy, he said his administration is embarking on reviving all regional airports and to start with Kigoma, Iringa, Morogoro, Singida and Mwanza to ease landing of flights in the regions. Nevertheless, President Magufuli said his government will ensure by 2018 the national flag carrier can be able to compete with other airline on regional destinations. “By 2018 we will be in a good position in the airline industry,” he said. Meanwhile, the president said he was prompted to implement the election manifesto which, among other things, campaign for improved economy. Improving infrastructure, according to the head of state, would help improve the economy. “This is why we’re also working on flyovers at Tazara and other places. The goal is to ease the movement of goods and services.” The government under Magufuli is eying an industry powered economy. Figures from the government show Tanzania will need to generate a 5000MW of electricity up from the current 1500MW to power the industrial economy. Dr Magufuli said yesterday that doors are open to all investors to invest in the energy sector.

Skip to content Satellite Press Releases Satellite Press Releases and News Moog Reports Fourth Quarter and Year End Results EAST AURORA, NY–(Marketwired – Nov 4, 2016) – Moog Inc. (NYSE: MOG.A) (NYSE: MOG.B) announced today financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended October 1, 2016. Fourth Quarter Highlights Earnings per share of $0.92, up 23% from a year ago; Sales of $619 million, down 1%; Restructuring and impairment expenses of $12 million, the equivalent of $.24 per share; Strong cash flow from operating activities. Full-Year 2016 Highlights Earnings per share of $3.47, up 4%; Sales of $2.41 billion, down 4%; Operating margins of 9.9%, up marginally; Strong cash flow from operating activities, continuing the strong pattern of recent years; Repurchase of 850,000 shares in the second and third quarters for $39 million. Segment Results Total Aircraft Controls sales in the quarter were $265 million, down 4% from a year ago. Military aircraft sales of $127 million were down 13%, with softness in both OEM and aftermarket sales. Commercial aircraft revenues increased 6%, to $139 million. Sales of OEM products to Airbus increased 44%, to $33 million, on the A350 ramp. Boeing OEM product sales were 14% higher, to $64 million. Commercial aftermarket sales were off marginally. For the year, Aircraft Controls sales were $1.1 billion, down 2%. Military aircraft OEM sales of $512 million were down 6% due to weaker sales on legacy programs including the F-15 and F-18 fighters, V-22 tilt rotor and Black Hawk helicopter programs. However, F-35 production sales were 6% higher, at $90 million. Military aftermarket sales of $200 million were off 5% due to the completion of the C-5 Super Galaxy modernization program. Commercial aircraft sales of $551 million in the year were up 2%, mostly due to increased Airbus A350 and Boeing 787 OEM deliveries. Commercial aftermarket sales were down 4% on lower initial provisioning of 787 spares and softer business jet activity.  In the quarter, Space and Defense segment sales were $97 million, up 5% year over year. Space sales were 14% higher, attributed to strong satellite propulsion sales. Defense sales were off 4% on softer ground vehicle sales in Europe. Space and Defense sales for the year were $366 million, down 4%. Space sales were $183 million, off 5%, as work on NASA’s Common EHA and Soft Capture programs wound down. Defense sales were down 3%, at $184 million, reflecting lower sales of missile controls and ground vehicle systems in Europe. Industrial System segment sales in the quarter were $131 million, up 2%. Most of the increase was tied to stronger foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. Energy sales were higher, simulation and test sales were mostly unchanged and industrial automation sales were down. Industrial System sales for the year were $515 million, down 1%, mostly due to foreign exchange movements. Weaker industrial automation sales for metal forming and steel processing equipment, off 6%, were partly offset by increased sales for simulation and test products and an increase in wind energy sales tied to pitch control systems. The Company’s Medical Devices segment has been integrated into the Components segment. All Components segment numbers referenced below have been restated and are comparable. Components segment sales in the quarter were $125 million, down 1% from last year on weaker industrial sales, in particular, sales of oil and gas exploration products. Aerospace and defense sales of $47 million and medical sales of $47 million were unchanged. For the year, Components sales were $467 million, down 13%, with lower sales across all markets. Consolidated year-end 12-month backlog was $1.2 billion. Fiscal 2017 Outlook The Company provided its initial projections for fiscal 2017. Forecast sales of $2.44 billion, up 1%; Forecast earnings per share of $3.50, plus or minus $0.20; Forecast full year operating margins of 10.3%; Another year of solid cash flow. “Q4 was a strong finish to a challenging fiscal 2016,” said John Scannell, Chairman and CEO. “Like many companies, we’re faced with a slow-growth environment and we responded with restructuring activities, on-going portfolio adjustments and continued investment for the long term. Our underlying operations performed well despite significant challenges in the year and we’re optimistic that the actions we’ve taken will lead to long-term performance improvements.” “We’re starting out fiscal 2017 with a cautious view of our markets. We’re assuming most markets will be fairly stable with the only real growth coming from the A350 program. We’re planning for a negative shift in the mix of programs in both our military and commercial aircraft businesses as production rates on legacy programs such as the F-18, 777 and business jets slow and new programs such as the F-35 and A350 continue to ramp up. Our Aircraft R&D will abate somewhat but will remain relatively high on our A350 and E-2 programs. We’ll also have a higher tax rate than fiscal 2016.”  In conjunction with today’s release, Moog will host a conference call beginning at 10:00 a.m. ET, which will be broadcast live over the Internet. John Scannell, Chairman and CEO, and Don Fishback, CFO, will host the call. Listeners can access the call live or in replay mode at www.moog.com/investors/communications.

The incident occurred during a training exercise as the tanker was preparing to refuel F-15s. There were no injuries as a result of the incident. In August the Air Force awarded a $2.8 billion contract to Boeing Co. (NYSE: BA) for production of the first 19 new KC-46A tankers to be delivered by August 2018. The new tankers will be produced in two lots: Lot 1 consists of seven planes and lot 2 will have the remaining 12. The total number of new tankers is set at 179 to replace less than half the exiting fleet of 59 KC-10 and nearly 400 KC-135 tankers. The KC-135s  average 55 years old and the newer KC-10s average 30 years old, according to an article last year in Air Force Times. According to a report in Aviation Week, the boom was found on private property near Hammett, Idaho, and subsequently recovered. The new Boeing tankers were supposed to begin deliveries to the Air Force next year, but a series of problems have pushed the schedule out until 2018. The KC-46A is based on Boeing’s 767 jet. Boeing built two 767-2Cs and two KC-46As as part of its engineering and manufacturing development contract with the Air Force. The fixed price for those planes was $4.9 billion. Boeing has had to swallow about $2 billion in costs above that figure, but it may be worth it. The total value of the contract could exceed $100 billion, including spare parts and other services.

Just in time for the big brewing lame-duck lobbying fight over the law letting 9/11 victims' families sue Saudi Arabia, foreign citizens are making their first attempt to use the law against the U.S. Turkish press reported an Istanbul district sued the U.S. for harboring the leader of the religious sect that President Recep Tayyip Erdogan blames for July's attempted coup. The plaintiffs said they were inspired by the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act and the principle of reciprocity in diplomacy and international law. JASTA's opponents warned this could happened, but until now it was just talk. Other dire predictions about the law's consequences, such as the Saudis' dumping Treasury holdings and withdrawing other assets in the U.S., have not materialized. NEW FRONTIER: Corporate lobbyists are now targeting the state officials who run elections and write ballot measures. Republican secretaries of state from Washington, Ohio, Colorado and Nevada met with tobacco company Reynolds American, the National Restaurant Association, and the National Rifle Association while those states were collecting ballot initiative signatures, according to documents obtained through open records requests show by Eric Lipton of The New York Times and ProPublica's Robert Faturechi. Liberal groups have also tried to support sympathetic candidates. Last month, Republican secretaries of state shot pheasants and clay pigeons on a weekend hunting retreat with donors in Kansas, where Allen Richardson, a Koch lobbyist, joked, “The Koch brothers out with the Republican secretaries of state — that’s a news story I don’t need.” DRUG FIGHT: The drug industry, including Eli Lilly and a front group called Patients Rising, is going on offense against the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review, a think tank that has been critical of rising drug prices, The Wall Street Journal’s Peter Loftus reports. The drug industry is spending $109 million against a California ballot proposal that give state agencies the same discounts as the VA and fighting an Obama administration proposal to reduce Medicare costs by changing doctors' incentives. WISH LIST: Environmentalists including Greenpeace and 350.org sent a wish list to Hillary Clinton for posts at the Energy Department, Interior Department and EPA, POLITICO’s Andrew Restuccia reports. "We want the Cabinet choices to demonstrate that we’re heard, when behind closed doors we’re told to 'get a life,'" said one environmentalist. The lefties favor Stanford University professor Mark Jacobson for energy secretary, President Barack Obama’s green adviser Van Jones for EPA administrator, co-chairman of the Congressional Progressive Caucus Rep. Raul Grijalva for Interior secretary and anti-Keystone XL movement leader Jane Kleeb. They oppose Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper, former Obama White House climate adviser Heather Zichal and any candidate that has financial interests in polluting companies or lobbied for groups that promote fossil fuels. The League of Conservation Voters, the Natural Resources Defense Council and the Sierra Club have kept mum. EYE ON TREASURY: Hillary Clinton’s list for Treasury Secretary may include Facebook’s Sheryl Sandberg; Federal Reserve Gov. Lael Brainard; TIAA-CREF President and CEO Roger Ferguson; Gary Gensler, chief financial officer of the Clinton campaign and former chairman of the CFTC; and Sheila Bair, a former chairman of the FDIC and now president of Washington College, Bloomberg’s Saleha Mohsin, Mike Dorning and Elizabeth Dexheimer report. Donald Trump is considering his campaign's finance chairman, Steven Mnuchin, who worked at Goldman Sachs, One West Bank, and now serves on CIT’s board and is chairman and chief executive of private investment firm Dune Capital Management, Zachary Warmbrodt reports for POLITICO.

It has spurred a hunt for microscopic cracks in similar disks, but answers may be elusive. Share story By Dominic Gates Seattle Times aerospace reporter The nearly catastrophic explosion of an engine that caused a fire on an American Airlines Boeing 767 just short of takeoff in Chicago on Oct. 28 occurred when a specific part that had never before failed broke into pieces. The breakup of a heavy metal disk that rotates in the engine core reveals a new risk to airline passengers that, however rare, has already spurred a scramble by engine-maker General Electric and government safety agencies to find and fix the vulnerability. “The risk will be eliminated,” said John Goglia, a former National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) member with more than 40 years’ experience in the aviation-safety industry. “Will it be eliminated before the next one? That’s the real question. Everything relies upon the timeliness of the system to correct itself.” American Airlines Flight 383 to Miami was speeding down the runway at O’Hare International Airport in Chicago when the second-stage disk of the high-pressure turbine broke apart inside the right engine with a loud explosion that blew metal shrapnel out through the engine casing.

Hot metal ripped through the wing. A fire ignited fed by spilling aviation fuel. In an update Friday, the NTSB described how the pilot aborted the takeoff just seconds before reaching a speed at which he would have had to leave the ground. Slamming on the brakes as the jet reached a speed of 154 miles per hour, he brought the plane to a halt within 25 seconds and 900 yards further down the runway. Moving quickly, the cabin staff evacuated all 161 passengers and nine crew using the escape slides on the undamaged left side of the aircraft. Twenty people suffered minor injuries. Behind them on the runway, the black smoke billowing skyward and the blaze melting the right wing into a drooping mess testified to how close the passengers had come to a large-scale tragedy. A flying ax GE spokesman Rick Kennedy stresses the reliability of the CF6 engine involved. The latest models, introduced in the 1980s, currently power about 4,000 widebody jets, including Boeing 767s, 747s and Airbus A330s, and have flown for more than 220 million hours. “The CF6 is the workhorse engine of jumbo jets on a level never experienced before,” Kennedy said. Yet the danger posed by a so-called “uncontained engine failure” cannot be overstated. The disk that broke apart in Chicago — one of two disks in what’s called the high-pressure turbine that drives the engine’s air compressor — is about 2 feet in diameter and weighs more than 100 pounds. At full power for takeoff, the temperature in the high-pressure turbine reaches more than 2,200 degrees. The pod around the engine has Kevlar armor around the big fan at the front, designed to contain any blades that fly off. But the pod cannot possibly contain the enormous energy of flying metal ejected from an engine-core breakup. The NTSB said Friday one piece of the broken disk went through the right wing, then arced high over the airplane and came crashing through the roof of a UPS warehouse almost 1,000 yards away. “Any time a turbine disk fails, it’s a big deal,” said Goglia. In 2006, a CF6-80 engine — the same model as in the Chicago incident — on another American Airlines 767 that was powered up during maintenance, exploded on the ground in Los Angeles, with no passengers aboard. A big piece of the high-pressure turbine disk in the left engine pierced the engine casing, sliced through the airplane’s lower fuselage and embedded itself like an ax-head in the casing of the right engine on the other side of the airplane. That jarring incident came after two other CF6-80 high-pressure turbine-disk breakups. In 2000, as a US Airways 767 was undergoing engine maintenance on the ground in Philadelphia, a disk rupture split the left engine clean in two and ignited a fire under the wing. In 2002, it happened in the air. The left engine of an Air New Zealand 767 blew up six minutes after takeoff from Brisbane, Australia, damaging the wing flaps and forcing an emergency landing. Luckily, there was no fire that time, and all 200 people on board were safe. A new vulnerability In all three of those CF6-80 incidents, the disk that broke up was the first of two inside the turbine. Although the two disks look alike, the first stage is next to the hottest part of the engine core and must withstand the highest temperatures and air pressure. After the 2006 incident, the government safety system kicked into high gear. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued an Airworthiness Directive ordering urgent inspections of these disks inside older CF6-80 engines. Subsequently, GE redesigned the first-stage disk to take more stress, adjusting the shape and the composition of the sophisticated nickel alloy. All planes flying today have been retrofitted with that redesigned disk, said GE’s Kennedy. “That’s behind us,” he said. But the disk that exploded in Chicago was the second-stage disk. This disk is subject to lower temperatures and air flow, so it undergoes relatively less stress than the first. “There has never been an Airworthiness Directive associated with a second-stage disk,” said Kennedy. “This is new.” That’s what’s raised alarm bells at the NTSB and the FAA. The NTSB said that particular disk had been flying for 18 years and completed almost 11,000 flights, short of the limit of 15,000 cycles after which it must be replaced. Goglia and other industry experts said the sudden breakup almost certainly stemmed from a microscopic crack, caused by a flaw in the metal invisible to the eye, that grew over years of service. Using electron microscopes, metallurgists at the NTSB Materials Laboratory in Washington, D.C., are now scanning the pieces of the broken stage-two disk, 95 percent of which was recovered. “They’ll examine the metal down to the tiniest element to determine the cause,” said Goglia. On Friday the NTSB said the metallurgists have already found “features consistent with fatigue cracking” at a point next to the central bore of the disk. This crack was initiated at a point in the metal that differs from the composition of the material around it, referred to as an “inclusion” or flaw in the metal. “Ongoing metallurgical examinations of the disk will focus on detailed characterization of the inclusion and the fracture surfaces,” the NTSB said. Such a flaw could have originated in tiny impurities in the bar of metal from which the parts were made almost two decades ago, or it may have been introduced during the forging or machining processes. Metals supplied for critical aerospace use are typically melted and resolidified twice to get rid of impurities. The process is meticulously recorded so that, for every part in the engine, GE knows exactly where the metal came from and when it was produced. Likewise, every person with the smallest role in the manufacturing of any piece of the engine records and signs off on their work. “The investigators will look at all aspects of making and machining the disks,” said Kennedy. “There’s a whole paper trail.” Kennedy said Friday that the company is “chasing down a very finite number of disks” made from the same billet of metal as the one that failed and has told airlines in a letter that only one such disk remains in an engine currently in operation. Company investigators will inspect the disk in that engine for microscopic cracks and will likely widen their inspections to more engines as the hunt for a cause continues. If any such cracks are found, the FAA will demand replacement of the disks and also review routine engine-maintenance practices to ensure such cracks are detected in future. A frustrating search So how closely scrutinized are these engine blowouts, and how challenging will it be to find and fix the cause? In 2010, GE redesigned and retrofitted a different part inside older CF6-50 series engines, after an NTSB urgent safety recommendation that followed four serious incidents overseas involving failure of that part. For the CF6-80 engine models like the one in the Oct. 28 explosion, the FAA in 2009 ordered additional inspections of all critical rotating parts, including the two high-pressure turbine disks. Until the Chicago incident, there had been no uncontained failures of the CF6-80 for a decade. During that time, the NTSB reports, there were seven other uncontained engine failures in the U.S., mostly less serious ruptures, in a variety of different engines. But one was similar in its outcome to the Chicago incident: The explosion of a GE-90 engine on a British Airways 777 jet taking off in Las Vegas in September 2015 also ignited a fearsome fire after an aborted takeoff. That was the first-ever uncontained failure of a GE-90 engine, and so likewise spurred a deep investigation. Yet GE’s Kennedy said that despite intense scrutiny of a widening circle of similar GE-90 engines, investigators have not been able to find a related issue in any other engine. More than a year later, the root cause of the Las Vegas blowup remains a mystery. Before the NTSB and GE investigators drilling into the Chicago incident can recommend measures to prevent a recurrence, they need to find the origin of the hidden flaw in the metal. The Las Vegas investigation shows that’s not easy. Dominic Gates: 206-464-2963 or dgates@seattletimes.com Email Newsletter Sign-up Custom-curated news highlights, delivered weekday mornings.

 SECOND QUARTER RESULTS Consolidated sales reached $91.6 million, compared with $94.5 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2016. This decrease reflects lower sales to both the commercial and defence aerospace markets, as detailed below, while year-over-year fluctuations in the value of the Canadian currency versus foreign currencies had a marginally positive impact of $0.2 million on second-quarter sales. Commercial sales were $48.7 million, versus $50.0 million last year. The decline mainly stems from lower Tier 1 customer requirements for landing gear components on certain business jet and large commercial aircraft programs. This factor was partially offset by higher engineering sales and by the ongoing production ramp-up related to the long-term agreement to supply The Boeing Company ("Boeing") with complete landing gear systems for the Boeing 777 and 777X aircraft. Defence sales decreased from $44.6 million to $42.9 million. This decrease mainly reflects lower spare parts requirements with the U.S. government and lower engineering sales following the completion of certain development phases. These factors were partially offset by greater R&O sales to European customers and the U.S. government as a result of a higher throughput at the Corporation's facilities. Gross profit reached $16.0 million, or 17.5% of sales, compared with $17.5 million, or 18.5% of sales, last year. The decrease is due to a less favourable sales mix and a higher under-absorption of costs, including excess processing and finishing costs related to the Boeing 777 program. These costs are expected to normalize upon completion of the customer qualification and approval of Heroux-Devtek's surface treatment process. These factors were partially offset by favourable year-over-year currency fluctuations equivalent to 1.5% of sales. Adjusted EBITDA was $14.1 million, or 15.4% of sales, compared with $14.6 million, or 15.5% of sales, a year ago as a result of lower gross profit, partially offset by a reduction in selling and administrative expenses related to year-over-year variations in the currency translation of net monetary items. Excluding non-recurring items net of taxes, adjusted net income was $5.7 million, or $0.16 per share, in the second quarter of fiscal 2017, versus $6.0 million, or $0.17 per share, in the second quarter of fiscal 2016. This year's adjusted net income excluded an after-tax amount of $3.8 million related to the favourable settlement of a litigation, net of legal and other professional fees. As a result, net income reached $9.5 million, or $0.26 per diluted share, in the second quarter of fiscal 2017. SIX-MONTH RESULTS For the first six months of fiscal 2017, consolidated sales reached $187.2 million, versus $192.8 million in the first six months of fiscal 2016. Year-over-year fluctuations in the value of the Canadian currency versus foreign currencies increased sales by $5.2 million. Commercial sales reached $99.3 million versus $101.4 million a year ago, while defence sales totalled $87.9 million compared with $91.3 million last year. Gross profit for the first half of fiscal 2017 amounted to $32.1 million, equivalent to 17.2% of sales, compared with $34.1 million, or 17.7% of sales, in the first half of fiscal 2016. Adjusted EBITDA reached $28.4 million, or 15.2% of sales, up from $27.7 million, or 14.4% of sales, a year earlier. Adjusted net income stood at $11.3 million, or $0.31 per share, versus $11.5 million, or $0.32 per share, last year. Net income was $14.7 million, or $0.41 per diluted share, in the first six months of fiscal 2017, compared with $10.5 million, or $0.29 per diluted share, in the first six months of fiscal 2016. FINANCIAL POSITION As at September 30, 2016, Heroux-Devtek's balance sheet remained healthy with cash and cash equivalents of $15.8 million, while total long-term debt was $146.3 million, including the current portion, but excluding net deferred financing costs. Long-term debt includes $71.1 million drawn against the Corporation's authorized Credit Facility of $200.0 million. As a result, the Corporation's net debt position stood at $130.4 million as at September 30, 2016, while the net-debt-to equity ratio was 0.39:1, versus 0.40:1 three months earlier. OUTLOOK Conditions remain mostly favourable in the commercial aerospace market. In the large commercial aircraft sector, Boeing and Airbus are adjusting production rates ahead of introducing certain more fuel efficient aircraft variants on several leading programs through calendar 2019. Despite slightly lower firm order intakes, their backlogs remain strong, representing approximately eight and ten years of production at current rates, respectively. In the business jet market, the current and future production ramp-up of models for which Heroux-Devtek has designed the landing gear should be favourable for the Corporation going forward. In the defence aerospace market, additional funding has been provided through the U.S. government's 2017 fiscal year, but uncertainty remains beyond that period given the need to address the deficit. The Corporation's U.K. operations provide Heroux-Devtek with a more geographically diversified defence portfolio, which reduces its relative exposure to the U.S. market. The balance between new component manufacturing and aftermarket products and services in the Corporation's defence portfolio and its leading program content also promote more stability. As at September 30, 2016, Heroux-Devtek's funded (firm orders) backlog remained relatively stable at $437 million, versus $438 million three months earlier. "The second half of the fiscal year has historically been stronger and this year should be no exception. Given first half results, and considering the effect of local currency depreciation on our UK operations, we expect low single-digit sales growth for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2017, though we no longer anticipate sales to reach $420 million. Still, over the medium term, we remain on pace to achieve annual sales of approximately $500 million in fiscal 2019 based on existing contracts and planned production rates. For the remainder of fiscal 2017, Heroux-Devtek remains focussed on ramping up production and meeting delivery schedules for the Boeing 777 contract. More progress has been made on the customer qualification and approval process of our new surface treatment equipment in Strongsville, Ohio and we expect to complete this important phase during the fiscal year. The rigorous execution of the largest landing gear contract in our history demonstrates our ability to carry out large-scale mandates, which further strengthens our reputation in the global landing gear market and places Heroux-Devtek in an enviable position to capture additional business opportunities to the benefit of shareholders," concluded Mr. Labbe.

Will Super Hornets bridge IAF's 200-aircraft gap? November 04, 2016 15:11 IST Boeing expects the IAF to soon place an inquiry for twin-engine fighter jets to bridge a 200-aircraft gap in its armoury. And the Super Hornet is ready to fly in, reports Ajai Shukla. The Indian Air Force has already approached major global fighter vendors, inviting them to build single-engine, medium fighters in India. Now the spotlight is expanding to encompass heavier, twin-engine fighters as well. On Thursday, November 3, Pratyush Kumar, president, Boeing India revealed that he expected a second inquiry from the IAF, asking international manufactures for interest in building twin-engine fighters in the country. Along with other vendors, Boeing had received the earlier inquiry for single-engine fighters. With nothing to offer in that category, Boeing wants to sell and build the twin-engine F/A-18E/F Super Hornet -- the US Navy's frontline fighter. Boeing had offered the Super Hornet in response to India's 2007 tender for 126 medium multi-role combat aircraft, but lost out to the twin-engine Rafale fighter, fielded by French aerospace vendor, Dassault. Even so, with New Delhi having procured just 36 Rafale fighters, Boeing assesses that, even after buying single-engine fighters, the IAF will face a major shortfall of twin-engine fighters. Kumar told media persons in New Delhi: 'There is a gap of about 200 fighter aircraft that the Super Hornet can fill, including the naval requirement. This is the assessment of Boeing.' Like the Rafale, the Super Hornet can operate from land-based airfields, and also aircraft carriers. The US military only uses it off aircraft carriers, but other air forces, such as the Royal Australian Air Force, operate the Super Hornet off land bases. Boeing has already submitted a plan through the US-India Defence Technology and Trade Initiative, a government-industry coordinating body, to build the Super Hornet in India. Unlike "other companies" that are offering to shift existing lines, says a politely dismissive Kumar, in a thinly-disguised swipe at Lockheed Martin, Boeing would establish "A brand new, state-of-the-art factory of the future." Boeing's global arch-rival, Lockheed Martin, the world's largest defence corporation (Boeing is the second-largest), has offered to shift its older F-16 line from Fort Worth, Texas to build the single-engine fighter in India. The F-16 faces competition in the single-engine category from the Gripen E, which Swedish company Saab has offered to build in India. Saab has sweetened its proposal with an offer to assist the Defence Research and Development Organisation with completing an improved version of the indigenous Tejas light fighter, called the Tejas 1A. Boeing's competition in the twin-engine fighter segment comes from Dassault and Eurofighter. Usually well-informed sources say Dassault, buoyed by its sale of 36 ready-built Rafale fighters to the IAF, is readying a proposal to build a significantly larger number in India. Boeing, unlike other fighter manufacturers, leverages its military business in India with a major non-military presence in the world's fastest-growing market for airliners. Kumar argues that Boeing's dual presence -- in civilian and defence aerospace -- creates a compelling business case for establishing manufacturing facilities in India. "Manufacturing volumes are needed to create a business case for manufacturing in another country. In defence, volumes are initially limited. So it is a great advantage when commercially viable volumes come from defence and civilian business combined," he explains. Boeing is readying to generate those volumes. In June, Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar inaugurated a new manufacturing facility in Hyderabad, where 300 employees will build fuselages for Boeing's Apache AH-64E attack helicopter, which India has contracted to buy. The facility, which will become the world's sole source for Apache fuselages, is owned by a joint venture between Boeing and Tata Advanced Systems Limited, called Tata Boeing Aerospace Limited. Kumar says the facility will commence production in mid-2017 and the first fuselages will roll out in 2018. In similar fashion, the current Super Hornet line in St Louis, Missouri, US would eventually shut down, leaving only the Indian line to fill global orders for new aircraft and spares.

Navigation Menu Film TV Digital Contenders Video Dirt Scene More Biz Music Legit Jobs Conferences Insight Archives Directory Choose Edition: U.S Latino Global Asia Russia | My Account Sign In Subscribe Home Film Spotlight French-Malian Director Daouda Coulibaly on His ‘Scarface’-Like Thriller ‘Wùlu’ Christopher Vourlias 0 Share This Article Email LinkedIn Print Pin It Tumblr Courtesy of TIFF November 4, 2016 | 02:13AM PT JOHANNESBURG — When a Boeing cargo plane crashed in northern Mali in 2009, just minutes after taking off from a remote air strip in the desert, investigators who arrived on the scene soon made a startling announcement: the plane was believed to be carrying up to 10 tons of cocaine from Venezuela, all of which had vanished without a trace after the crash. While that tale of international intrigue wasn’t the direct inspiration for “Wùlu,” French-Malian helmer Daouda Coulibaly’s riveting debut, the director recalls how the mysterious Boeing crash forced many Malians to recognize for the first time the scale of the drug trade using West Africa as a transit point between Latin America and Europe. That trade was the launching pad for his fast-paced, “Scarface”-style portrait of a young Malian hustler seduced by a life of crime. For Coulibaly, who was born to parents of Malian and Guinean descent in Marseilles, the film is as much a tale of one man’s rough underworld education as it is a reflection of the helmer’s cinematic schooling. While the director acknowledges the influence on his work of African auteurs like countryman Souleymane Cissé, the kinetic pacing of “Wùlu” suggests an even greater debt to the likes of Brian De Palma and Martin Scorsese. It also reflects the vision of a younger generation of African filmmakers whose inspiration is increasingly urban and global. “This is a different time,” he says. Coulibaly is a product of Focus Features’ Africa First program, an initiative that for six years offered funding, mentorship, and distribution deals to young African talent, before being shuttered in 2013. The program, which awarded $10,000 toward the production of a short film, helped Coulibaly and more than two dozen emerging filmmakers from across the continent get exposure on the international stage. The first three shorts to come out of the program – “The Tunnel,” by South Africa’s Jenna Bass; “Pumzi,” by Kenya’s Wanuri Kahui; and “Saint Louis Blues,” by Senegal’s Dyana Gaye – world premiered at Sundance. Coulibaly’s “Tinye So” traveled to the New York African Film Festival, the BFI London film fest, Milan, and Dubai. Gaye’s feature debut, “Under the Starry Sky,” bowed in Toronto, while Bass’ “Love the One You Love” won a slew of awards after its world premiere at the Durban film fest, while also earning nominations in Busan and Gothenburg. For “Wùlu,” Coulibaly spent two years scouting locations in Mali. “I knew exactly what I wanted to do,” he says. But just two months before principal photography was about to begin, Islamic militants attacked a restaurant in Bamako, killing five. Coulibaly and his producers suddenly wondered if the risks were too high. While they’d planned to spend six weeks on location in Mali, it was in neighboring Senegal that they decided to lens most of the film. The decision weighed heavily on Coulibaly, who almost abandoned the project. But in the end, he believes he made a stronger movie because of it. “The problems is that when you shoot, you don’t work anymore. You just execute,” he says. “The fact that I changed things, it pushed me to be creative.” Despite lensing mostly in Senegal, “Wùlu,” which takes its title from a rite of passage among the Bambara people of Mali, is still deeply rooted in Malian culture. Coulibaly first visited the country at an early age, but it was as a teenager that his interest began to grow. Fatherhood would later help him to recognize the importance of teaching his two young children about their roots, and he relocated the family to Bamako for four years before returning to France in 2015. While Coulibaly says he’s “very proud…[to be] an African filmmaker,” he doesn’t want that to inform the lens through which audiences watch his movies. “If it’s a thriller, it’s a drama, it’s still seen as an ‘African film,’” he says. “We still have this kind of attitude [where] people keep seeing your stories as ‘African.’ “I’m not an activist,” he says. “I just want to make films.” Filed Under: Daouda Coulibaly Joburg Film Festival Wùlu Want to read more articles like this one?

The US Air Force's "Air Superiority 2030" initiative identified a hybrid PCA capability as key to ensuring air superiority in future denied battlespaces. IBTimes Staff Reporter November 4, 2016 14:27 IST 10 Shares 10 Shares Boeing's new concept will join the fray for the USAF's sixth-generation air superiority fighterWikiCommons Boeing has released the new concept art for the US Air Force's next-generation fighter jet. Aviation Week, who had access to the artwork, referred to it as a "sleek, tail-less design featuring conformal engine inlets and what looks like a manned cockpit." The report stated that the aircraft looked more like a fighter-bomber than a pure fighter. "The tail-less airframe, thin swept wings and conformal shaping suggest a stealthy, penetrating aircraft that may be able to fly supersonic. The silhouette of a pilot inside the cockpit indicates Boeing is banking on the Air Force sticking with at least an optionally manned platform for the future capability," it said.

The air force has recently initiated an Air Force Scientific Advisory Board (AFSAB) study that will begin identifying key capabilities needed to fight in the battlefield of 2030. According to Aviation Week, the Air Force's "Air Superiority 2030" initiative identified a hybrid PCA capability as key to ensuring air superiority in future denied battlespaces characterised by sophisticated air defense systems and counterair technologies. But so far, the air force has only described PCA in relatively broad terms. The report added, "We do know that PCA will be a 'family-of-systems', and will likely include some kind of next-generation stealth fighter to operate alongside and eventually replace Lockheed Martin's F-22s and F-35s. It may also incorporate the new arsenal plane concept, where multiple sensor-shooter aircraft direct fire from an aerial bomb truck crammed with munitions." Earlier in the year, Flight Global stated in a report that according to service officials, there's no "silver bullet" or "exquisite" next-generation fighter jet that will single-handedly evade and counter the types of surface-to-air, air-to-air, anti-satellite, electronic attack and cyber threats that are springing up around the world, particularly if going up against a nuclear-armed state like Russia or China. Instead, the air force would proceed with parallel technology development efforts, like new propulsion systems, airframes, directed energy weapons and hypersonic missiles, to develop a "family of systems" – including longer-range, higher-payload platforms to launch volleys of weapons at targets from "standoff" distances and others that will swoop in for direct attacks.

There's a problem with horizons, though: The closer you get, the more they seem to recede. That's certainly the case in the commercial aerospace market, where products can take decades to develop and decades more to sell. The proposed aircraft will carry 280 people for 12,000 kilometers (7,500 miles) and begin deliveries in about 10 years, according to Commercial Aircraft Corp. of China Ltd., or Comac, which plans to develop the planes alongside Russia’s United Aircraft Corp.  Charity Begins at Home China's domestic aviation market is well on the way to being the world's biggest. Longer-haul markets fall well behind. Source: Boeing 2016-2035 Market Outlook Note: RPK = revenue passenger kilometer, a traffic measure equivalent to flying a single paying passenger a single kilometer. Labels indicate starting point and end point of most popular routes. China has two major advantages in developing an indigenous commercial aerospace industry, and two big drawbacks. Its domestic aviation market is growing fast and will be the world's biggest by 2035. In addition, the dominance of airlines owned by the same state agencies that control Comac means a local manufacturer is well placed to twist arms with potential buyers. Years Pratt & Whitney PurePower engines spent in development 25 The problem is technology. Commercial aircraft, and the engines that power them, are some of the most complex objects ever manufactured. Pratt & Whitney's PurePower Turbofan jet engines spent some 25 years in development before entering service in 2013. Airbus and Boeing are already wearing themselves out trying to keep up with each other's advances into new materials technologies. Both the 787 Dreamliner and the A350 XWB are made up of about 50 percent composite materials such as carbon fiber. The C919 will have less than the A320 -- a model range that dates back to the 1980s -- according to a 2014 article posted on Comac's website. Stuck on the Tarmac Bombardier is nowhere near competing yet in the market for narrow-body aircraft. Orders by year Source: Bloomberg Intelligence Life for challengers to the big two is even harder. Canada's Bombardier Inc. planned to demolish the short-haul duopoly of Boeing's 737 and Airbus's A320 when it started developing its C Series jet in 2004. More than a decade on and with only a tiny slice of the market, the program drove Bombardier to seek a $1 billion bailout from Quebec's provincial government this year. While the C919 has been plagued by delays and is already almost three years behind on its first test flight, it's probably not the aircraft to bet against. As long as Comac can make the thing fly, it can hope for an almost guaranteed market within China -- enough on its own to deal a severe blow to Airbus and Boeing. The proposed twin-aisle jet is a trickier proposition. To sell a plane overseas, Comac will have to convince aviation regulators in other countries that its planes are safe to fly over major cities, then persuade foreign airlines to order them. Purchasing a new model of plane isn't as simple as buying a new car: Pilots and engineers must be retrained and maintenance supply chains set up, so airlines will want to see a strong track record before taking the plunge. Airbus was around for 17 years before it won its first order from a major U.S. airline. It didn't win a deal with a major Japanese carrier until as recently as 2013. Profit Engine Five-year average operating margins of major commercial aerospace companies Source: Bloomberg Note: Shows operating margins for commercial aviation divisions of respective companies. Given all that, and the fact that aircraft manufacturers aren't very profitable anyway, you'd be tempted to wonder why Comac would bother if it wasn't being driven by national pride. It took Airbus three decades to become a serious challenger to Boeing. There will probably be a similarly long runway before Comac's ambitions get airborne. This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners. A contract with regional carrier Eastern Airlines had been signed six years earlier, in 1978.

The target for average annual earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, and rental costs in the 2016 to 2020 period was lowered to EUR5.3 billion ($5.9 billion). Last year, the airline company raised the level from an average of EUR5 billion to about EUR5.6 billion. Shares slumped 3.04%. IAG last week cut its 2016 earnings outlook because of the sharp fall in sterling following the U.K. vote to leave the European Union. Profit now is expected at EUR2.5 billion, down from EUR3.2 billion at the start of the year. The company reports earnings in euros, but the British Airways unit, which generates most profit, principally sells tickets in pounds, which are worth less after the Brexit vote. The June referendum drove the British currency to a more than 30-year low. European airline overcapacity has contributed to a sharp fall in ticket prices this year, one of several headwinds for European airlines, which also have had to contend with depressed bookings from terrorist attacks and strikes that have led to flight cancellations. Competition is heating up in the lucrative trans-Atlantic market, where a new breed of long-haul discount carrier such as Norwegian Air Shuttle SA are challenging the dominance of established U.S. and European network airlines. British Airways on Friday said it would embark on a restructuring plan, shedding staff and lowering costs, "We are going to look for ways to make the company more efficient," BA Chief Executive Alex Cruz said at an investor briefing for IAG. BA is adding seats on some of its Boeing Co. 777 widebody planes to lower unit costs and better compete against the emerging field of discount long-haul carriers. The denser plane will drive unit costs below those of Norwegian Air's Boeing 787 Dreamliners, he said. BA's Mr. Cruz said his airline would also roll out product enhancements to win higher-paying passengers. A new business class seat is being developed, as well as in-flight upgrades. The airline will also reintroduce business class on some short-haul routes. British Airways Chief Financial Officer Steve Gunning said the carrier plans to take a fourth-quarter restructuring charge on par with the EUR62 million restructuring costs booked in the previous quarter. Even higher costs loom in 2017 for the cost-cutting program, he said. Additionally, BA didn't say how many employees might exit the company ahead of negotiations with employees. Mr. Gunning said 550 crew members took up a buyout offer last quarter. Sister airline Iberia is negotiating a voluntary redundancy program for another 1,000 employees, airline Chief Executive Luis Gallego said Friday. He said the measures would help Iberia meet IAG financial commitments. IAG said capacity through the end of the decade is now expected to grow around 3% a year, compared with a previous forecast of 3% to 4%. Capital expenditure plans for the coming years were cut to EUR1.7 billion a year from EUR2.5 billion projected a year ago. To help lower costs, IAG plans to delay taking delivery of some of Boeing's Dreamliners and the rival Airbus Group SE A350 jet. British Airways will fly some older Boeing 747 jumbo jets longer. IAG left unchanged other medium-term targets, including a sustainable 15% return on invested capital, an operating profit margin of 12% to 15% and average earnings-per-share growth of more than 12% a year. The company's free cash flow expectation remains at EUR1.5 billion to EUR2.5 billion a year.

But will new contracts follow? Rich Smith (TMFDitty) Nov 5, 2016 at 10:15AM The U.S. Air Force doesn't hate the A-10 Warthog -- at least not officially. In fact, the Air Force doesn't have an official position on the Warthog at all. It has more like a dozen of them. The A-10 Thunderbolt II "Warthog" is one scary fighter jet -- and may just have scared the Air Force into keeping it. Image source: Getty Images. On the one hand, the Air Force commissioned a promotional documentary a few years back explaining how the A-10 Warthog is its single best fighter jet "built for ground combat," and how "its presence alone is enough to keep the enemy at bay." On the other, the Air Force also says anyone who clues in Congress to the Warthog's value risks "committing treason." Indeed, on a third hand, the Air Force has repeatedly called for the Warthog's retirement, arguing this is the best way to free up funds for the Air Force to buy more F-35 stealth fighter jets from Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT). And on, and on, and on. Sanity check Last week, the Air Force announced its latest position on the A-10 Warthog, and I can just about guarantee that this one will surprise you: After years of maneuvering to get the A-10 retired from service, the Air Force now wants to keep the A-10 Warthog flying. What's more, they may even be willing to pay for it. As you may recall, the Air Force currently plans to begin retiring A-10s from service in 2018 and to completely eliminate the aircraft from its inventory by 2021. But Secretary of the Air Force Deborah Lee James recently told Aviation Week that she'd consider "different approaches" to keep the A-10 in service "longer" than that -- although she didn't say how much longer. That vagueness has some folks questioning the Air Force's commitment to its close-air support mission. But James insists  that "we stand by 150% the close-air support mission." And there's at least some evidence of actions being taken to back up those words. Last month, AW reported  that maintenance depots servicing the A-10 are "ramping up capacity" to maintain the A-10. Air Force Materiel Command chief Gen. Ellen Pawlikowski confirms that her command has "turned on the depot line, we're building it back up in capacity and supply chain," and is making plans to continue maintaining the A-10 "indefinitely." What it means to investors All of this costs money -- and for defense contractors such as Lockheed Martin, Boeing (NYSE:BA), and Northrop Grumman (NYSE:NOC), perhaps enough money to be worth fighting over. For example, a recent piece in Popular Mechanics referenced Boeing's $2 billion contract to install new, upgraded wings on dozens of the 283 A-10 Warthogs still in service. At the same time, both Lockheed and Northrop Grumman share in the $700 million to $840 million per year that the Air Force says it spends on maintaining and operating its existing A-10s. The longer those A-10s keep flying, the longer those revenues will keep flowing to Lockheed, Boeing, and Northrop. By the same token, though, the key reason behind the Air Force's historical efforts to retire the A-10 remains its desire to spend this money on buying new F-35 stealth fighter jets. If the Air Force is now rethinking the idea of retiring the A-10 Warthog, that would seem to imply a reduction in the rate at which it buys F-35s -- which would necessarily pinch Lockheed's profits. So how should investors respond to this latest shift in Air Force priorities? Given the frequency with which the Air Force changes its mind about the A-10, I'm not convinced there is a need to respond to this latest development, which could be reversed yet again in the very next press release. For now, the Air Force's latest rethink seems to give hope to fans of the A-10 Warthog, and investors in the companies that are maintaining, and upgrading the aircraft. But we'll want to see more hard numbers, and actual contract awards, before acting on those hopes. Fool contributor Rich Smith does not own shares of, nor is he short, any company named above.

By DC Velocity Staff Comment Joe Sutter, who is known at the "Father of the 747" When shippers need to move valuable cargo long distances in a hurry, they often turn to air cargo. More expensive than options like sea, rail, or truck, air freight has one great advantage—speed. Today, most people take for granted the ability to whisk inventory from coast to coast in a few hours, but few outside the aviation industry remember the name of Joe Sutter. Sutter, who passed away Aug. 30 at the age of 95, is known in the aviation trade as the "Father of the 747." Although he had a hand in many iconic commercial airplane projects, he secured his place in history by leading the team of Boeing engineers that designed the 747 jumbo jet—a team that became known as the "Incredibles" for their feat of producing what was then the world's largest airplane in a 29-month period in the mid-1960s. Boeing went on to sell more than 1,500 747s after completing the original version in 1968, according to the New York Times. The plane was a smash hit because it could haul more passengers and cargo than other aircraft, while flying faster and farther than its competitors could without stopping to refuel. The 747 also boasted a 20-foot-wide twin-aisle passenger cabin, fully seven feet wider than the cabin of its predecessor, the 707. And Sutter made one more design decision that would influence the airfreight industry for decades—he left space for the eight-foot-square cargo containers that would eventually become the global standard for air freight. #Logistics #Transportation #Air Resources Mentioned In This Article Boeing Inc.

Travel News & Advice British Airways to shrink seat space to squeeze more passengers on to flights Exclusive: Airline's 777 jets will have one extra seat per economy row from 2018 Simon Calder @SimonCalder Friday 4 November 2016 16:45 BST BA is adding 52 extra seats to its Boeing 777s The squeeze is on for British Airways economy passengers on the aircraft type that is airline’s long-haul backbone. BA is to add an extra 52 seats to its Boeing 777s at Gatwick from 2018, and plans to “densify” aircraft at Heathrow after that.  Travellers who are accustomed to reasonable elbow room in the cheap seats will find they have less space. While British Airways has nine economy seats abreast in its 777 fleet at present, from 2018 each row will have 10 seats – even though the average girth of passengers is increasing. If the number of toilets stays the same at 11, accommodating almost a fifth more people means that there will be one for every 30 passengers, compared with 25 passengers now. Read more Fury as BA launches seven holiday routes from Heathrow BA increases minimum check-in time Father banned from BA flight despite having a valid passport 25 taken to hospital after emergency on British Airways plane Willie Walsh, chief executive of BA’s parent company IAG, told investors at a Capital Markets Day: “We’re responding to a market opportunity.” He said the move would allow BA to “lower the average cost per seat, charge a lower price and stimulate demand”. In the late 1990s, British Airways had a small fleet of Boeing 777 aircraft at Gatwick that were fitted with 10 seats in each economy row for routes to Florida and the Caribbean. In 2002 they were converted to the nine-abreast configuration to match the rest of the fleet. The slide shown to investors at the Capital Markets Day A spokesperson for BA said: “We are updating our 777 cabins to bring us into line with many of our competitors.” Other airlines with a 10-abreast configuration on the jet include Air New Zealand and Emirates. Air France has a special fleet devoted to Caribbean and Indian Ocean services with 10 seats in each row. Read more These are the world's longest flights BA says that the economy cabin will be fitted with new entertainment systems with bigger screens. British Airways and its main European rivals, Lufthansa and Air France-KLM, face intense competition from Gulf-based carriers, with low-cost, long-haul airlines such as Norwegian also poaching passengers. Lufthansa is rapidly expanding its Eurowings subsidiary to operate a range of long-haul routes, while Air France says it plans to start an entirely new airline “adapted to ultra-competitive markets”. The subsidiary is intended to “enable the Group to go on the offensive by opening new routes, reopening routes closed due to their lack of profitability and maintaining routes under threat”. British Airways will also add 12 extra seats on its short-haul Airbus A320 fleet operating from Heathrow, giving the planes the same seating density as easyJet.  Willie Walsh was previously chief executive of both BA and Aer Lingus, which is also part of IAG. He told investors that passengers connecting to the Irish airline’s transatlantic services in Dublin could soon be flying on Ryanair. Mr Walsh confirmed that Aer Lingus is in talks with Europe’s biggest low-cost airline about feeding traffic to long-haul routes.

By Geoff Ziezulewicz   |   Nov. 4, 2016 at 11:11 AM Follow @upi Comments Sign up for our Security newsletter WASHINGTON, Nov. 4 (UPI) -- Boeing has been awarded a $478 million U.S. Air Force contract for work on the F-15 Eagle Passive/Active Warning and Survivability System. The cost-plus-incentive-fee deal will cover engineering manufacturing and development of the system. Under the deal, the contractor will provide planning, design development, integration, testing and risk reduction activities for the system. Work will be performed in Missouri and has an estimated completion date of August 2020. The Air Force Life Cycle Management Center is the contracting entity. Boeing chose BAE Systems in October 2015 to help develop the electronic warfare system that provides advanced aircraft protection, significantly improved situational awareness and support for future F-15 mission requirements. The system will replace the F-15's Tactical Electronic Warfare Suite, which has been in use since the 1980s. The new system will help ensure the aircraft remains in its scheduled service through 2040. The new system requires a smaller footprint than the past system while providing advanced capabilities that include advanced electronic countermeasures, radar warning and increase chaff and flare capability.

Plans to take 38 Airbus A350s and Boeing 787s are “under review” for deferral, IAG told investors Friday. It will retain four more aging 747 jumbos than planned and an extra seat will be added to each economy-class row on 25 777s based at London Gatwick, creating 52 new berths per plane from 2018. The changes, which also envisage a fleet of 362 Airbus A320-series short-haul jets, 34 fewer than previously planned, will cut capital spending by 1.4 billion euros ($1.6 billion) through 2020. Chief Financial Officer Enrique Dupuy said the rethink is “about delays, not about cancellations,” and that IAG, which also owns Ireland’s Aer Lingus and Iberia and Vueling of Spain, is confident of renegotiating delivery schedules with Airbus and Boeing. IAG’s capacity growth will now be limited to 3 percent through 2020 as a seating glut weighs on fares and the U.K. vote to exit the European Union creates uncertainty and threatens to crimp spending among Britons. Alex Cruz, who runs the BA unit, said voluntary departures are being sought among back-office staff and cabin crew that more IT work will be outsourced. While London-based IAG will retain more 747s -- for a total of 23 by 2020 -- it will get rid of four smaller A340s, which like the jumbo is a venerable four-engine jet that’s less efficient than current models, paring the fleet to seven. The delivery of a sole A330 wide-body has also been deferred. Earnings Downgrade At the same time IAG will devote 400 million euros more to Aer Lingus as it seeks to switch to longer-range variants of the single-aisle A321, reducing the net capital saving to 1 billion euros. A320s operating for Iberia and at the London Heathrow hub of BA will get 12 more seats, while Heathrow’s A321s will get 13 more. The number of smaller A319s at BA will drop to 26 from 44. IAG also cut its long-term profit target as sterling’s decline hurts revenue when translated into euros, in which it reports. Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortization and aircraft rental will now average 5.3 billion euros in the 2016 to 2020 period, down from a previously estimated 5.6 billion euros. Charges this quarter against the British Airways redundancies could match the third-quarter’s 62 million pounds ($78 million), though the bulk will come next year, IAG said, adding that benefits of as much as 400 million euros will take about 18 months to accrue. The plans require consultation with unions. Cruz said BA also aims to reduce maintenance fees and handling costs as it works to slim expenses while pressing home a margin advantage over U.S. rivals from sterling’s devaluation versus against the dollar. The higher-density 777s will provide a cost advantage over Norwegian Air Shuttle ASA, which has begun trans-Atlantic flights from Gatwick. BA has announced plans for new routes including Gatwick-Fort Lauderdale, where it will go to toe-to-toe with the Scandinavian carrier. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Excluding items, the company reported adjusted earnings of $3.51 per share, outperforming analysts’ estimates of $2.62 per share. Revenue slipped 7.5% to $23.9 billion from $25.8 billion in Q3 2015, edging above the $23.64 billion in revenue analysts were expecting.

For Boeing’s Defense, Space &amp; Security division, Q3 2016 revenue was $7.5 billion, down 10% on a y-o-y basis. Operating margin in the reported quarter was 10.4%, down 1.8%, reflecting solid execution and the impact of the Commercial Crew program. Backlog at Defense, Space &amp; Security was $53 billion, of which 38% represents orders from international customers. The Boeing Military Aircraft (BMA) unit within the Defense, Space &amp; Security division reported Q3 2016 revenue of $3.3 billion, down 19% from Q3 2015,reflecting fewer C-17 deliveries and volume on F-15.

The Boeing 787-9 is an extended version of the company’s 787-8 Dreamliner that debuted in American’s fleet last year. The new plane is 20 feet longer and seats 285 people, compared to the 226 seats on American’s 787-8. The plane on display at American’s maintenance hangar Thursday hasn’t entered service yet, but a different 787-9 has been ferrying passengers between DFW Airport and Los Angeles International Airport for the last month.

(Nathan Hunsinger/The Dallas Morning News) Staff Photographer Thursday night, American will dispatch the 787-9 on its first international route from DFW to Sao Paulo, Brazil. On Friday, a 787-9 will fly from DFW to Madrid, with plans to add it to routes to Paris and Seoul early next year.  American will have four 787-9 in its fleet by the end of this year, with 18 more still on order. The plane features 30 lie-flat business class seats, 21 premium economy seats, 27 main cabin extra seats-- a coach seat with added legroom -- and 207 economy seats. Pass the popcorn: American Airlines makes in-flight movies and TV free for all While the 787-9 has all the modern touches as the 787-8s currently in service -- including in-flight entertainment screens at all seats and in-flight WiFi -- it’s the first plane in American’s fleet to feature the new premium economy seating section. The premium economy seats, laid out in a 2-3-2 configuration, are wider and feature more-legroom -- about seven extra inches compared to a regular economy seat. The premium economy service also comes with noise reducing headphones, an amenity kit, nicer blankets and pillows, meal service and free alcoholic beverages. It’s roll out is part of a broader airline strategy to introduce more seating options for customers. For instance, while some passengers might not want to pay for business class seats, they could opt to upgrade to the more affordable premium economy class. That’s key for airlines as they work to attract passengers and wring every dollar possible out of a flight at a time when fares have been lower due to increased airline competition. While this type of premium economy seating has been seen on foreign carriers for several years, American will be the first U.S. airline to debut it, although Delta announced Thursday its version of the offering will be available next year. The airline buzzword passengers should know before buying a ticket Premium economy will come pre-installed on all of American’s new 787-9 and its Airbus A350s set to start arriving in 2018. The carrier also plans to retrofit most if its widebody fleet over the next several years to feature the new seats. For now, passengers who want to sit in the premium economy seats will have to purchase a Main Cabin Extra fare and make sure their seat is in rows nine through 11. The seats will be sold under the premium economy banner at a higher price starting in January for flights in April and beyond.

Boeing, Airbus trade barbs as China competition heats up By Benjamin CARLSON Zhuhai, China (AFP) Nov 2, 2016 China, Russia to invest 'up to $20 bn' in long-haul jet: report Shanghai (AFP) Nov 3, 2016 - China and Russia will invest up to $20 billion to develop a long-haul wide-bodied jet, reports Thursday and a company statement said, as Beijing seeks to challenge leading Western manufacturers Boeing and Airbus. The hugely ambitious plan was first agreed between the Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC) and Russia's United Aircraft Corporation (UAC), whose products include the Sukhoi Superjet 100, in June when Russian President Vladimir Putin met his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping in Beijing. COMAC said in a statement that the joint venture, to be set up in Shanghai this year, will develop a 280-seat wide-body plane with a range of 12,000 kilometres. That would put it in direct competition with Boeing's 787 and the Airbus A350. The project is worth between $13 billion and $20 billion, with each side contributing half, China's state-run Global Times newspaper on Thursday quoted UAC president Yury Slyusar as saying. "COMAC has outstanding technology and designs and we will not only cooperate in technology but also in intellectual property," Slyusar told the newspaper at the China Airshow in the southern city of Zhuhai, adding the plane will be 10 percent cheaper than its competitors. According to the companies' websites, the list price of a 280-seat Airbus A350 is $272.4 million, while a 290-seat Boeing 787 costs $264.6 million. Their putative China-Russian rival will make its first flight in seven years' time, COMAC said, with deliveries beginning three years later. But developing commercial aircraft is an advanced technological challenge and previous Chinese aerospace projects have suffered lengthy delays. COMAC said it will keep the project open and select global suppliers that are willing to "jointly shoulder risks". Beijing is looking to build up its domestic aerospace industry, with the sector among those highlighted in its "Made in China 2025" plan. The country is expected to become the world's largest aviation market, with its travellers taking to the skies in ever-growing numbers. Airbus estimates China will need nearly 6,000 new planes worth $945 billion in the next two decades, with Boeing's forecast even more optimistic at more than $1 trillion. COMAC is also developing its own single-aisle jet, the C919. It rolled it out last year and even though it has yet to make its first flight COMAC says it has so far received 570 orders from 23 customers. The firm's regional jet, the 90-seat ARJ21, flew its first commercial flight in June after years of delays. Russian Helicopters to sell three helicopters to Chinese company Moscow (UPI) Nov 2, 2016 - Russian Helicopters announced Wednesday it will sell three helicopters to China's Jiangsu Baoli Aviation Equipment Co. The Rostec subsidiary will deliver Mi-171A, Ansat and a Ka-32 helicopters to the company in a deal revealed during the Airshow China 2016, Russian Helicopters said in a statement. Jiangsu Baoli will receive an Ansat light helicopter in a medevac configuration, along with the other two, next year. Russian Helicopters has established partnerships with the company. A contract for four Ka-32s was signed in 2015, with all deliveries slated to be completed by mid-2017. The aircraft will be used for firefighting, while the Ka-32s can also maneuver in the wilderness and land at unprepared zones. China already operates more than 350 Mi-8/Mi-17 helicopters. Ka-32s of various configurations are already in use in Spain, Portugal, Colombia, Switzerland, Canada, South Korea, Taiwan, Japan and others. Aerospace giants Boeing and Airbus took potshots at one another at the Zhuhai air show, as the US and European rivals seek to capture more of China's booming aircraft market. China is one of the Western manufacturers' key battlegrounds, with its travellers taking to the skies in ever-growing numbers. The country's airlines will need nearly 6,000 new planes worth $945 billion over the next two decades, Airbus said in its 2016-2035 Global Market Forecast. Boeing's expectations are even more optimistic, for 6,800 aircraft costing $1 trillion. To win favour locally both have built partnerships with Chinese firms. Airbus has a completion and delivery centre in Tianjin, where workers install furnishings and apply paint to aircraft for the domestic market. It also buys parts such as exit doors, brake blades and wing sections from Chinese suppliers. Boeing is planning to open a facility with the state-owned Commercial Aircraft Corp. of China (COMAC) to paint and install cabins for 737-model planes, the Chinese firm said. Eric Chen, president of Airbus China, dismissed the Seattle firm's plan as "close to one generation" behind his own firm, saying it was following Airbus's strategy "with a lot of reluctance". "I got two impressions," he said at a briefing at the China Airshow in Zhuhai, the industry's biggest event in the country. "First one, the decision we made 10 years ago was right. The second impression is that we are well in advance of our competitor." Darren Hulst, managing director for Northeast Asia marketing at Boeing, earlier told reporters that the Airbus A350 fell short of the 787 widebody plane in range, capacity, carbon emissions, window size and aerodynamics. "The 787 is capable and has technology and features built into it that are not available on the A350, which was obviously introduced later into the market," he said. He added the company had 14 China deliveries of 787-9s in 2016 and had secured orders and commitments for 46 more. - Future rivals - While the two megafirms see a sunny future in China, homegrown competitors backed by Beijing aim to beat them at home -- and ultimately abroad. Chinese authorities have urged companies to acquire technology and skills in a range of high-value sectors including aerospace in the "Made in China 2025" plan. At the same time as it is working with both Boeing and Airbus, COMAC is developing single-aisle jets to compete with them. Its C919 narrow-body is going up against the Boeing 737 and Airbus A320 in the 160-seat segment, which the Chinese company predicts will have more than 17,000 deliveries over the next 20 years. In Zhuhai COMAC announced that state-owned China Eastern Airlines had committed to buy 20 C919s. In the summer COMAC's regional jet, the 90-seat ARJ21, flew its first commercial flight after years of delays. Boeing, Airbus and Canadian regional builder Bombardier all played down the threat of Chinese competition. But the business climate has darkened for US and European firms in the country, with the American Chamber of Commerce in China reporting this year that more than three-quarters of survey respondents felt "less welcome" there. Pessimism among European companies hit an all-time high in the summer, according to a European Chamber of Commerce in China report on the "increasingly hostile" business climate. Chinese-built planes are sure to secure market share in the country, Eric Lin, Hong Kong-based director of Asia transport research with UBS Securities, told AFP. In the short term, he added, foreign firms have little to fear from Chinese rivals in the developed countries that are their home market. "But after 10 years, it's hard to say," he noted. China has a history of adapting foreign technology with remarkable swiftness, turning from a buyer of Russian military aircraft to a producer of advanced stealth jets in 20 years. Its high speed rail and clean energy industries went from collaborators to competitors faster than global rivals anticipated. Like all foreign firms with valuable intellectual property operating in China, the aerospace giants understand the risks of training their future rivals, said Christopher Balding, professor of economics at Peking University's HSBC Business School. But they are stuck between a rock and a hard place, he added, because shareholders want them to fight for Chinese market share. "Even if they don't come to China, there's a good chance that if they are doing anything innovative it's going to get stolen anyway, so the only thing they are doing is harming their revenue." bfc/slb/sm BOEING AIRBUS GROUP HSBC UBS GROUP AG BOMBARDIER Tweet Related Links Aerospace News at SpaceMart.com Subscribe free to our newsletters via your Email Address SPACE DAILY SPACE WAR TERRA DAILY ENERGY NEWS MARS DAILY GPS DAILY SEED DAILY WIND DAILY DISASTER NEWS SOLAR ENERGY MEDICAL NEWS NUCLEAR NEWS OIL & GAS NEWS BIO FUEL DAILY Buy Advertising Editorial Enquiries Uber lays out vision for flying commuter transit San Francisco (AFP) Oct 28, 2016 Uber on Thursday laid out a vision for on-demand aircraft that can whisk commuters to home or work in a fraction of the time it would take on the road.

The hugely ambitious plan was first agreed between the Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (Comac) and Russia’s United Aircraft Corporation (UAC), whose products include the Sukhoi Superjet 100, in June when Russian President Vladimir Putin met his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping in Beijing.

China’s state-run Global Times newspaper yesterday quoted UAC president Yury Slyusar as saying that the plane will be a state-of-the-art design. According to the companies’ websites, the list price of a 280-seat Airbus A350 is US$272.4mil (RM1.13bil), while a 290-seat Boeing 787 costs US$264.6mil (RM1.11bil). Their putative China-Russian rival will make its first flight in seven years’ time (2023), Comac said, with deliveries beginning three years later. — AFP Tags / Keywords: china Related Stories Company makes underperforming employees eat live worms as punishment ‘World’s saddest polar bear’ must be removed from display at Chinese shopping mall, say campaigners Singles Day bargains get delivered on trains More than 200 million Chinese remain single First woman to fly China’s J-10 fighter jet killed during training You May Be Interested Closure of 106 bank branches due to rationalisation plans, says Deputy Finance Minister Weak ringgit to impact 5 sectors Best smartphones for the holidays Alibaba's founder to support 'mini Jack Ma' until university graduation Private-public partnerships in a connected world Rejuvenate yourself with American ginseng Others Also Read Facebook lets Messenger 'bots' tap analytic smarts Widespread apathy hampers recycling campaign MRT fare starts at RM1 advertisement Latest News Polls, Macron campaign launch throw French presidential election wide open Syria's Assad say must wait and see if Trump lives up to promises to fight militants Key Venezuela lawmakers step down in concession to government U.S. House reauthorises Iran sanctions bill, sets Syria sanctions Trump win adds pressure on Brazil to pass reforms, executives say Most Viewed in News Zuraida refuses to accept apology from Jamal Yunos Closure of 106 bank branches due to rationalisation plans, says Deputy Finance Minister Heavy downpour brings traffic to a crawl along swamped LDP Adam Rosly: I purchased house with hard-earned cash Zuraida questions approval for Jamal's helicopter ride Jamal baffled how PKR Youth division leader can afford 'castle' home Tycoon Joseph Lau reveals details of breakup with ex-girlfriend in full-page newspaper announcement Family of Chinese student forced to give nude selfies to loan sharks to pay off her debts Snatch thief killed while fleeing from pursuers I initiated 1MDB probe, Najib tells Japanese weekly Powered by advertisement advertisement site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Lifestyle Tech Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services Magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs Advertising View Our Rate Card Policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu StarProperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com Search The Star Online   Connect with us Content Partner Our Radio Stations site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Tech Lifestyle Travel Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs advertising View Our Rate Card policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu starproperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com social media Facebook Twitter Copyright © 1995- Star Media Group Berhad (ROC 10894D)

Swiss International Airlines, Kuwait Airways and Flydubai have raised BAC's portfolio of airline customers to 23 and is boosting utilisation of its production capacities which can churn out some 40,000 meals a day. BAC, Thailand's second-largest in-flight catering service provider, started serving Kuwait and Swiss on Oct 31 and Nov 1, respectively, and will begin its service for Flydubai on Nov 28. The deals are for three years. BAC managing director Linus Knobel told the Bangkok Post that the inclusion of the three airline clients reflect their trust in the company's product and services and competitive bidding. Part of Bangkok Airways Group, the catering company is now vying for contracts to serve Qantas Airways, Pakistan International Airlines and a few other carriers that make Suvarnabhumi their port of call. Having Swiss on board is a good credential for BAC , whose clientele include some of the world's top carriers such as Emirates, Qatar Airways and Turkish Airlines, said Mr Knobel. BAC caters for the Swiss airline's daily flights on the Bangkok-Zurich route, operated by Boeing 777-300ERs; Kuwait's six flights weekly on Bangkok-Kuwait with Airbus 330 and 340 series; and Flydubai's two daily flights on Bangkok-Dubai with Boeing's 737-800 single-aisle jets. Mr Knobel said BAC's facilities at Suvarnabhumi can raise its output to as many as 50,000 meals a day if demand requires. It can add another 5,000 meals a day in a relatively short term, he added. The company's largest airline customers in terms of sales are Bangkok Airways, Emirates, Qatar and Turkish, respectively, he said. BAC facilities, which have been running for 10 years, have three separate kitchens that prepare foods conforming to kosher and halal regulations to meet the needs of airlines such as El Al Israel and Emirates.

Skip to content Repeating Islands News and commentary on Caribbean culture, literature, and the arts Toggle Sidebar November 3, 2016November 3, 2016 Jumbo Jet Makes its Last Run of ‘World’s Scariest Landing’ in St. Maarten [Many thanks to Peter Jordens for bringing this item to our attention.] Jeffrey Cook (ABC News) reports that “one of the world’s scariest landings” will no longer take place in St. Maarten: For 26 years, a tropical paradise has been home to one of the world’s scariest and most exhilarating landings in the world. Today, that era came to an end. The last KLM Boeing 747 touched down in St. Maarten at 11:03 a.m. ET today. Since 1990, Dutch airline KLM has served beach goers hair-raising landings as their jumbo jets soared at low altitudes over the sandy coast and onto the runways at Princess Juliana International Airport. Going forward, the route to St. Maarten will be served by Airbus A330s, seating 243 passengers, as oppose to the 408 passengers that fit into the Boeing 747. The flight from Amsterdam used to make a stop to drop off passengers in Curacao in addition to St. Maarten.  KLM will now fly three direct flights a week from Amsterdam to St. Maarten and seven to Curacao. Aviation enthusiasts have dubbed the experience as one of the world’s scariest landings and will certainly be lamenting the end of an era.

Dienes was an Army Air Corps photographer sent in to document the bomb's effects. by Michaela Winberg, STAFF WRITER Close icon Michaela Winberg STAFF WRITER Milton Dienes was dispatched in November 1945 to Nagasaki, Japan, as an Army Air Corps photographer, just 100 days after an atomic bomb obliterated much of the city, killing at least 40,000 people instantly and thousands more from the lasting effects of radiation exposure. Slideshow King of Prussia veteran's Nagasaki photos Advertisment of Gallery: Facebook icon Twitter icon Pinterest Mail icon Related links After mysterious disappearance, flag will fly again over vets' cemetery Main Line veteran recalls intense fighting, his capture and rescue Open or Closed for Veterans Day Then, Dienes didn't know the danger of radiation exposure and he walked the streets of the hilly, historic port city without protective gear. The streets of Nagasaki Dienes walked were mostly deserted. He saw collapsed homes once made of sheet metal. Most of the homes weren't built very well, he said, and some "just blew away" in the atomic blast. Concrete buildings appeared to have melted together in the bomb's intense heat - their textured surfaces smoothed by the high temperatures. "It was almost like a glass surface," Dienes recalled. Nagasaki was mostly factories and buildings then - there were few people to photograph, which "was actually better," he said, because their suffering would have been hard for him to face. "The damage, it was strange," said Dienes, now 92, who lives with his wife Harriet in King of Prussia. "It left an impression, something you can't possibly forget." Dienes, a member of the Army Air Corps' 9th Photographic Technical Unit, captured with his Speed Graphic camera unforgettable images of the catastrophic destruction of Aug. 9, 1945. He and his buddies also processed the historic photos taken by pilots of Boeing B-29 Superfortress planes as the atomic bombs were being dropped on Hiroshima and, three days later, on Nagasaki. Those blasts are widely credited for Japan's surrender and the end of World War II. Dienes and his squadron returned to their lab in Guam to develop hundreds of original, on-the-ground and aerial photos that captured the bomb drops and subsequent destruction in Nagasaki. Those historic images, unpublished and mostly unseen outside the military, are now destined for the Library of Congress archives. "I have all these photographs and the stories that go along with them," he said. "I've had some stuff published, but I didn't expect anything like that," Dienes said. About two months ago, Dienes got a phone call from Col. Diane Hickey, commander of 14th Intelligence Squadron based in Dayton, Ohio. "It was so out of the blue because, number one, I had no connection to Dayton," Dienes said. "I just knew it was a major base for U.S. intelligence." Hickey had been searching for Dienes for years. The 14th Intelligence Squadron inherited the lineage of the 9th Photo Technical Unit, but she had almost no record of its existence. "They had no information whatsoever of what we did there - not only that, but they had no photographs," Dienes said. "They didn't know what we did or how we did it." After two years of searching, Hickey finally found Dienes online, listed as a veteran of the unit. "I came across Mr. Dienes, and found this rich history that we didn't even know about," she said. "These were the guys that processed the photos from Nagasaki." Out of more than 100 original members of the 1945 9th Photographic Technical Unit, Hickey found Dienes and one other veteran, John "Jerry" Johnson from Mercer, Pa. "They're still living, they still remember the stories, their minds are still sharp," Hickey said. "They have great memories that have not been recorded, and photos." She invited the two veterans to spend a long weekend in late September in Dayton, hoping to introduce them to the current members of 14th Intelligence Squadron. "By the time we finished, they had a lot of information that they didn't know before," Dienes said. "They copied every photograph I brought with me ... probably 75 or 100 photographs which they never had before." Dienes and other members of his squadron built the photo lab in Guam in 1945 - a structure that looked more like a shack than a studio. Developing photos in the lab back then was "primitive" at best, Dienes said. Days in Guam were usually hot, around 80 degrees. Dienes explained that photo negatives required cool temperatures to properly develop, so he kept an icemaker in the lab, producing 8,000 pounds of ice a day to ensure the right conditions to develop nearly 14,000 photos. Now 71 years old, those black-and-white photographs shot on 4-by-5-inch film are still in "really good shape," he said, "which means we did a good job in the lab when we made them." Dienes, born and raised in the Logan neighborhood of North Philadelphia, graduated in 1942 from Central High School, where he was a school yearbook photo editor. He headed to Pennsylvania State University to earn a pre-med undergraduate degree, but his education was interrupted shortly after his freshman year. A telegram arrived on May 29, 1943, instructing Dienes to report for duty the next morning. But he had a scheduling conflict. "It was my parents' 25th wedding anniversary, and we had a big party planned," Dienes said. "So I called the colonel - I didn't know any better - and I told him I had a problem with that date." Dienes said the colonel told him his problem was "irregular," to say the least, but he nonetheless granted his request to stay home and celebrate with his parents. It wasn't until August 1943 that the Army instructed him to report for duty in the 75th Infantry Division in Alabama. The division was preparing to fight in Europe during the Battle of the Bulge, but Dienes was transferred last minute to the Air Corps. He trained in Mississippi and in Oklahoma, using his experience to help "put together" the photo squadron and teach pilots to use cameras for the first time. Dienes served in Guam from May 1945 to March 1946. After he was discharged, he returned to Penn State to continue his sophomore year, but he didn't complete his degree. Instead, he did some photographic work in the city before joining Jerrold Electronics as a salesman. Later, he was director of marketing at General Instrument, a Horsham-based electronics company. About 30 years ago, Dienes founded Summit Sales & Marketing, a manufacturer's representative company for consumer electronics and computer products. By the time he retired in September 1990, he had earned $96 million in sales, just shy of his lifetime goal of $100 million. When Dienes retired, his only son Garry took over the business. For the most part, Dienes has only shown his photos and told his story sparingly, mostly at local libraries and country clubs. He has had no ill effects from any radiation exposure in Nagasaki. "I don't glow at night," he joked. His mind is sharp: Dienes can still recall every story, every detail of his involvement in World War II without hesitation. He displays his Nagasaki photographs with pride - some of them are mounted on a large poster in his dining room, looking almost like new; the others are tucked away in a photo album, protected from the light. Sharing his photos with the 14th Intelligence Squadron in Dayton will forever be "one of the greatest experiences of my life," Dienes said. "It's great as we start to get older and start to appreciate those that went before us in the military," Hickey said. "The fact of the matter is: They are a part of history, and they're a part of our history." mwinberg@philly.com 215-854-5915 @mwinberg_ Published: November 5, 2016 — 5:48 PM EDT | Updated: November 7, 2016 — 12:17 PM EST The Philadelphia Inquirer We encourage respectful comments but reserve the right to delete anything that doesn't contribute to an engaging dialogue Help us moderate this thread by flagging comments that violate our guidelines Commenting policy | Comments FAQ Comment policy: Philly.com comments are intended to be civil, friendly conversations.

(Photo: John Giles / PA Wire) The imperatives of the climate crisis and the logic of economic austerity are at war—and Washington State is on the front lines. So-called “revenue-neutral” carbon pricing—whereby the proceeds are used to fund tax cuts—has long been a cherished hobbyhorse of free-market economists and the odd Republican who favors climate action. It’s also the policy of choice for big polluters like ExxonMobil. And now this right-wing friendly model is being pushed in Washington State, thanks to Initiative 732. I-732, on the ballot on November 8, would be the first revenue-neutral price on carbon in the United States. It is widely unpopular among the state’s Democrats, Republicans, and even the business lobby, and has only managed to win the support of one significant environmental group. But on the off chance it is approved by voters, it would be a disastrous precedent that could set back the climate justice movement for a decade—time that we simply can’t afford to lose. Some have accepted the logic that something is better than nothing, even arguing that a “tax swap” could substitute for a just transition to a low-carbon economy. The evidence proves otherwise. In British Columbia, two-thirds of the tax cuts have ended up in corporate pockets, while carbon emissions have been rising in recent years and the fracking industry has boomed. By some estimates, I-732 would raise gasoline and electricity prices less than 15 percent by 2040 in Washington State—hardly enough to jumpstart an urgent, sweeping phase-out of fossil fuels. Meanwhile, it would offset carbon revenues by cutting taxes for big corporations, including major polluters. (According to the Seattle Times, Boeing could see windfalls of tens of millions annually.) And while polluters get rewarded, the communities of color that have born the burnt of fossil fuel pollution, and the working people whose jobs are at risk as we move away from fossil fuels, are left empty handed. The money raised by the tax won’t be used to fund green jobs in low-income communities, or to retrain workers currently in high carbon sectors. In other words, this is the epitome of an unjust transition. In fact, this “neutral” tax might not even break even, with a state government analysis concluding it would blow a $797.2 million hole in Washington’s budget over six fiscal years—this at a time when the legislature is under court orders to fix its failure to adequately fund education. So rather than the equitable green transition that has long been promised (better and more affordable public transit, community controlled renewable energy…), low income communities could well end up with even more eroded services than they have now. The backers of I-732 are running on a pessimistic platform of “just do something,” preying on the real urgency that so many of us feel in the face of the climate crisis. But sometimes “something” is worse than nothing, especially if it will stand in the way of better proposal down the road. A paltry, revenue-neutral carbon tax simply cannot deliver the massive green energy investments and community-driven solutions we all need. Science-based climate action means an unprecedented, rapid, and decisive shift to renewables; a truly equitable carbon tax can play an important role in spurring the transition, but it won’t work unless we make the polluters pay, and put their immoral profits to work repairing the damage they have knowingly created. The way to do that is to mobilize the broadest possible coalition—led by the frontline communities who stand to benefit most from building a cleaner and fairer economy. “Don’t let the perfect be the enemy of the good,” I-732 proponents like to say. It sounds good, but it is not what opponents of in this initiative are doing. “Perfect” is not on the table—we lost that option when climate action was delayed for decades. So much time has been lost, in fact, that now we have just one shot to get the policy right. And that means we can’t let the politically difficult be the enemy of the scientifically and socially necessary. © 2015 The Nation Naomi Klein Naomi Klein is an award-winning journalist, author, and syndicated columnist.

The airline giant is to add the seats into Boeing 777s at Gatwick from 2018, with those based at Heathrow next. Alamy 2 A British Airways Boeing 777 mid flight – there are plans to add in one more seat per row by 2018 Currently these planes, which are the most commonly used for passengers using BA, has nine economy seats per row. But these new plans would see that increase to 10 seats per row. The number of toilets could stay that same despite the extra numbers, meaning those waiting in familiar long lines to relieve themselves could be waiting even longer. The Independent reported Willie Walsh, chief executive of BA’s parent company IAG, told investors at a Capital Markets Day: “We’re responding to a market opportunity.” RELATED STORIES HUMAN RIGHTS ACT SNUB Network Rail cancels Amnesty International's Human Rights Act campaign as it is 'too political' FESTIVE WARNING Scientists discover Christmas shopping could cause fatal heart problems 'SOMETHING WENT WRONG' OAP dies in blaze after firefighters 'just down the road' take more than 90 minutes to arrive 'a risky experiment' Government's plans to replace nurses with less-qualified staff could cause up to a fifth more deaths brits 'best' for blood Brits have the 'healthiest blood pressure in Europe' after dramatic drop in cases of hypertension 'driving us nuts' Pet squirrel causes train delays in south London after getting trapped in one of the carriages He said the move would allow BA to “lower the average cost per seat, charge a lower price and stimulate demand”. A spokesperson for BA said it was updating the planes to “bring us into line with many of our competitors”. This comes after it was announced passengers will have to pay for food and drink on short-haul flights if they want a mid-air snack. The airline is ditching the free food on offer on flights under five hours, putting it on the same page as other no-frills carriers like easyJet and Ryanair. Alamy 2 The number of toilets could stay that same despite the extra numbers BA unveils pop-up orchestra Other airlines which have 10 seats per row include Air New Zealand and Emirates. While space for passengers would be smaller, BA has said the economy cabin would be fitted with new entertainment systems. The airline also has plans to add in 12 extra seats on short haul flights using the Airbus A320 flying from Heathrow. BA passengers will be able to surf the web using wifi on short-haul flights from next summer. The technology will allow passengers to watch streaming services, such as Netflix, watch Skype or FaceTime family and friends across multiple devices.

Two decades ago, about 35 percent of jobs in the workforce required some type of technical training; these days the percentage is closer to 65, says Ed Parris, president of Phillips Staffing. “The demand for technically skilled people has doubled in the last 10 years, probably,” Parris said. “And it’s only going to increase more because all of the BMW suppliers, the Boeing suppliers, the Volvo suppliers, as they get their plant started down in North Charleston — these are all companies that are bringing in highly automotive jobs that require a pretty sophisticated technical skill set.” Employers are seeking out workers who have skills in areas from welding to mechatronics, which has made workforce development a priority in South Carolina, said John Lummus, president and CEO of Upstate South Carolina Alliance. And companies that are considering locating in the Upstate have one overriding question, Lummus said. “Workforce is always the No. 1 question prospects ask us when they’re looking at the Upstate,” he said. “It’s just vital that we continue to have a great skilled workforce because that’s the No. 1 priority for companies. And we do, we do have a great skilled workforce.” South Carolina has one of the top workforce development systems in the country, Lummus said. The readySC program, which helps recruit and train workers at new and expanding companies, has been around since 1961, and more recent programs include Upstate Career Skills Now and Greenville Works, as well as the Center for Manufacturing Innovation at Greenville Tech. And Apprenticeship Carolina, which has been around for about seven years, allows employees to combine in-class education and on-the-job training. In 2007, when Apprenticeship Carolina was launched, “there were only 90 companies in the state with apprenticeship programs, and now I think we have over 670 programs,” Parris said. “So there are a lot of positive initiatives taking place. It’s just, we’ve really got to get involved and stay behind these programs to try to stay ahead of the curve, because the skills gap is only going to get worse as the baby boomers leave the workforce.” Area Development magazine ranked South Carolina No. 2 in its Top States for Doing Business rankings this year, in part for its workforce development efforts. “South Carolina is at the top in the nation in our workforce development programs, and we’re very proud of that,” Lummus said. “And we really sell that. And I feel really good about our workforce development system in the state.” The importance of workforce development was highlighted last month at the Greenville Tech Foundation’s Workforce Development Salute, which honored three individuals and organizations that have contributed to Greenville’s efforts. John I. Smith Charities has awarded more than $450,000 in scholarships to Greenville Tech students over the past two decades, and the organization helped to equip Greenville Tech’s Center for Manufacturing Innovation. Elizabeth Clayton, who serves on the board of John I. Smith Charities, said that making these contributions is “very important for not only the individual, but the whole Upstate and the economy. When you can help people get jobs and help the industry in the area have quality employees, I think that’s a great way to grow our economy and to provide a great way for people to live in the Upstate.” Also honored was Ralph Hendricks, a longtime businessman and philanthropist whose Ralph and Virginia Hendricks Foundation has contributed more than $500,000 in scholarships to Greenville Tech. “More and more, I’ve decided that’s what I have when I leave here is through this foundation, and I’m going to request that the trustees spend most of it in education. I’ve never been big on what they call brick-and-mortar,” Hendricks said. “My request is that they hold that to a minimum and try to get the money into the schools so they can get a decent basic education.” The third honoree was T&S Brass and Bronze Works Inc., whose contributions include equipment for projects at Greenville Tech, as well as an endowment that awards scholarships annually to one student from each high school in Greenville County. Greenville Tech’s Center for Manufacturing Innovation is one important component of workforce development, but other technical colleges have made an impact as well, Parris said. “I think that we’re doing a better job than most in addressing this problem. The tech schools are one of our greatest assets,” he said. “We have a great tech school system here in South Carolina. The training programs are receiving renewed emphasis.” Those programs are especially important because of the challenges faced by employers needing to fill high-tech jobs, Parris said. “I would say right now that workforce development has never been more crucial because we really have a critical problem with the skills gap and the low unemployment in our area,” Parris said. “It’s a good problem to have, but the influx of new economic development projects is bringing in a lot more high-tech, higher-paying jobs. That being said, there’s a startling imbalance in today’s labor market. Manufacturers in particular are struggling to fill thousands of open jobs. And I don’t want you to think that this is a problem that’s unique to us. It’s a national problem; in fact, it’s an international problem.” On a recent trip to the United Kingdom, Parris spoke with officials from Jaguar and Range Rover who have similar difficulties. “They said they had 50,000 open jobs in their automotive sector that they can’t fill because of a lack of skilled labor,” he said. One benefit of the changes is increased wages for workers in these industries, regardless of whether they have a college degree. “I was in an Upstate county this morning with an economic development professional, and in 2010, in his county, they had 14-percent unemployment. Now, it’s 4.5 percent, and he’s looking at more projects to come on board this year,” Parris said. “You get to a 4-percent unemployment rate, you’re getting down to what’s called total employment, where anybody that wants to work can pretty much find a job. And people are going to have to pay more, and wages are going to go up. And in this particular county, they had gone up significantly. The average wage rate had gone up three or four dollars over the last four or five years.” Experts say the key to meeting future demand for technologically advanced jobs is to begin early, exposing kids to science and technology careers during elementary school. “Having the career education in the K-12 system is key to making sure we continue to have the available workforce as we move forward,” Lummus said. High schools in the area have long had career centers that offer vocational programs for students, but the programs have changed over the years to reflect the evolving needs of the workforce. “One of the biggest initiatives we’re launching now in our school systems is trying to bust that myth that everybody needs a four-year degree,” Parris said. “There are people roaming the streets of Greenville with psychology (degrees) and English majors and history majors and liberal arts degrees that can’t find a job, that can’t find a $35,000 a year job. And there are kids coming out of the tech schools with a two-year technical degree can easily make $60-, $70-, $80,000 a year.” While the skills gap is still a problem, South Carolina is working hard to address it, and that approach is making a difference, Lummus said. “I really think that companies that are coming here, that are locating here are able to find the workers that they need, that are skilled and trained in what they need to do,” he said. “We have not had that problem with companies that are coming in, but if you look forward into the future, we always have to have that in our mind, that we need to continue to ramp up the level of training for the future.” 12 CONNECTTWEET 5 LINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://grnol.co/2f4Bltp TOP VIDEOS Top economists say growth on the upswing for 2017 16:11 LeBron James frustrated by Phil Jackson's 'posse' comments 0:57 Raw: Stranded quake cows rescued in New Zealand 0:33 Donald Trump’s victory sends U.S. dollar soaring 2:24 Bill Cosby: Hopes of resuming illustrious career 0:26 Closing Bell: Emerging markets decline on Trump Win 1:08 Procter & Gamble merges beauty business with Coty 3:19 Gadget Makers Target Health At CES Unveiled 1:41 Chinese spend billions on singles day 0:55 McDonald's Workers Share Birthday and Last Name 1:44 Being My Own Boss Greenville printer produces "All In" chips for Dabo Swinney Mandrallius Robinson For serial entrepreneur Adam Anderson, making money not end goal Eric Connor Dapper dogs: Easley entrepreneur caters to canines Scott Keepfer Gurminder Thind discovered his passion early Willie T.

But will new contracts follow? Rich Smith (TMFDitty) Nov 5, 2016 at 10:15AM The U.S. Air Force doesn't hate the A-10 Warthog -- at least not officially. In fact, the Air Force doesn't have an official position on the Warthog at all. It has more like a dozen of them. The A-10 Thunderbolt II "Warthog" is one scary fighter jet -- and may just have scared the Air Force into keeping it. Image source: Getty Images. On the one hand, the Air Force commissioned a promotional documentary a few years back explaining how the A-10 Warthog is its single best fighter jet "built for ground combat," and how "its presence alone is enough to keep the enemy at bay." On the other, the Air Force also says anyone who clues in Congress to the Warthog's value risks "committing treason." Indeed, on a third hand, the Air Force has repeatedly called for the Warthog's retirement, arguing this is the best way to free up funds for the Air Force to buy more F-35 stealth fighter jets from Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT). And on, and on, and on. Sanity check Last week, the Air Force announced its latest position on the A-10 Warthog, and I can just about guarantee that this one will surprise you: After years of maneuvering to get the A-10 retired from service, the Air Force now wants to keep the A-10 Warthog flying. What's more, they may even be willing to pay for it. As you may recall, the Air Force currently plans to begin retiring A-10s from service in 2018 and to completely eliminate the aircraft from its inventory by 2021. But Secretary of the Air Force Deborah Lee James recently told Aviation Week that she'd consider "different approaches" to keep the A-10 in service "longer" than that -- although she didn't say how much longer. That vagueness has some folks questioning the Air Force's commitment to its close-air support mission. But James insists  that "we stand by 150% the close-air support mission." And there's at least some evidence of actions being taken to back up those words. Last month, AW reported  that maintenance depots servicing the A-10 are "ramping up capacity" to maintain the A-10. Air Force Materiel Command chief Gen. Ellen Pawlikowski confirms that her command has "turned on the depot line, we're building it back up in capacity and supply chain," and is making plans to continue maintaining the A-10 "indefinitely." What it means to investors All of this costs money -- and for defense contractors such as Lockheed Martin, Boeing (NYSE:BA), and Northrop Grumman (NYSE:NOC), perhaps enough money to be worth fighting over. For example, a recent piece in Popular Mechanics referenced Boeing's $2 billion contract to install new, upgraded wings on dozens of the 283 A-10 Warthogs still in service. At the same time, both Lockheed and Northrop Grumman share in the $700 million to $840 million per year that the Air Force says it spends on maintaining and operating its existing A-10s. The longer those A-10s keep flying, the longer those revenues will keep flowing to Lockheed, Boeing, and Northrop. By the same token, though, the key reason behind the Air Force's historical efforts to retire the A-10 remains its desire to spend this money on buying new F-35 stealth fighter jets. If the Air Force is now rethinking the idea of retiring the A-10 Warthog, that would seem to imply a reduction in the rate at which it buys F-35s -- which would necessarily pinch Lockheed's profits. So how should investors respond to this latest shift in Air Force priorities? Given the frequency with which the Air Force changes its mind about the A-10, I'm not convinced there is a need to respond to this latest development, which could be reversed yet again in the very next press release. For now, the Air Force's latest rethink seems to give hope to fans of the A-10 Warthog, and investors in the companies that are maintaining, and upgrading the aircraft. But we'll want to see more hard numbers, and actual contract awards, before acting on those hopes. Fool contributor Rich Smith does not own shares of, nor is he short, any company named above.

According to UK’s Independent, “BA is to add an extra 52 seats to its Boeing 777s at Gatwick from 2018, and plans to “densify” aircraft at Heathrow after that.” Travellers who are accustomed to reasonable elbow room in the cheap seats will find they have less space. While British Airways has nine economy seats abreast in its 777 fleet at present, from 2018 each row will have 10 seats – even though the average girth of passengers is increasing. If the number of toilets stays the same at 11, accommodating almost a fifth more people means that there will be one for every 30 passengers, compared with 25 passengers now,” the website added.

Along with the live event at Edmonds Center for the Arts, 13 community libraries will host livestream viewing along with four partner sites including Snohomish PUD auditorium, Everett; Everett Community College, Edmonds Community College and University of Washington Bothell. To ensure seating, registration is required for the Sno-Isle Libraries sites. Registration is not required for the four partner sites. “We’ve heard some frustrations that we are just now announcing the speaker lineup, even though registration opened 20 days ago,” Harvey said. “This is something that sets TED and locally organized TEDx events, such as TEDxSnoIsleLibraries, apart from other conferences. “TED and TEDx is about coming to hear something, not see someone,” Harvey said. “It is the promise of delivering and connecting with a day of ideas, not about speaker names, credentials or personalities.” Still, Harvey said he’s pretty excited about who will be delivering those ideas. “The speakers range in age from 16 to 64,” Harvey said. “They also range from a CEO to high-school students, from a horse trainer to a robotics team coach along with other backgrounds that serve as launching points for the ideas they will bring forth.” Harvey also pointed out that the day is intended to be transformational for the speakers as well as those who hear and see them. “The speakers are chosen by a team of Sno-Isle Libraries staff members, starting from a list of nominations that we solicit from the public,” Harvey said. “But that’s just the beginning. Once chosen, the speakers go through a substantial orientation and training to help hone the presentation of their messages. “Many of the speakers from the 2015 event said this was one of the most valuable and transformational things they’d ever been involved in,” Harvey said. The speakers for TEDx SnoIsle Libraries 2016 are: Andre Feriante, flamenco guitarist, poet Andre’s career path was set at 13, when he first heard the flamenco guitar.

A disk within the General Electric Co. CF6-80 engine had an “internal inclusion,” meaning some type of foreign debris was embedded within the special alloy designed to withstand the heat and high stresses of a jet engine, the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board said in a statement. GE believes it has identified the “limited number” of disks manufactured at the same time that may have the same flaw and only one other remains in operation, the company said in a letter Friday to carriers. “We are currently working with the operator to accomplish removal of the remaining part in service,” said the letter, obtained by Bloomberg. The NTSB statement didn’t say whether the flaw posed a risk in other engines. GE didn’t immediately respond to an e-mailed request for comment. In a statement earlier Friday, GE said it hasn’t experienced such a failure in parts made with the same alloy in more than 30 years. There are more than 4,000 of the various CF6 engines in service and they’ve flown more than 400 million hours, GE said. “Given the number of incidents that have occurred, I wouldn’t say it rises to the level of a fleet issue,” said Robert Mann, president of aviation consultant R.W. Mann & Co. “But it’s something they obviously have to think about -- how that occurred, why that occurred.” GE and the unnamed supplier of the Inconel 718 alloy, commonly used in the hot section of engines, are reviewing production records for NTSB investigators, GE said in a statement. O’Hare Airport The 170 people aboard American Airlines Flight 383, a Boeing Co. 767 at Chicago’s O’Hare International, raced out of left-side exits after an orange fireball erupted on the right of the plane. The engine had blown up during a takeoff attempt, triggering a fuel leak and the fire. At least 20 people suffered minor injuries during the evacuation, according to the NTSB.

You will now receive the Game Plan newsletter The CF6-80 engine failed so violently that pieces of the spinning disk flew 2,920 feet (890 meters) away, striking a warehouse, the NTSB said in a briefing Saturday. Jet engines are encased in armor and have other safeguards to ensure that shrapnel can’t escape in a failure, so the NTSB will try to determine why those protections failed. The plane was accelerating for takeoff and pilots were able to stop on the ground before lifting off. American Airlines declined to comment because of the continuing investigation, said Ross Feinstein, a spokesman for the carrier. The disk, located in the rear portion of the engine, where burning fuel races past fan blades to spin the turbine, broke into at least four pieces, according to NTSB. It was designed to withstand at least 15,000 startups and had only been used 10,984 times, the NTSB said. In its letter to operators of the same engine model, GE said it had identified “a material anomaly” that appeared to be linked to the failure. “Although the investigation is still under way, a limited number of closely related CF6-80C2 parts have already been identified, only one of which is still in operation,” GE said in the letter. The engine involved in the American fire was built in 1997, according to GE. “Since the 1970s, the GE CF6 engine has been one of the workhorse jet engines of the airline industry, powering seven widebody commercial jets models with industry-leading levels of reliability,” GE said in its earlier release. 100 Million It has been used on many aircraft, including the Airbus Group SE A330 and Boeing’s MD-11, 747 and 767. The power plants have accumulated more than 100 million flights since their introduction, according to the company. While there have been dozens of safety alerts on various models of the engine issued by NTSB or the Federal Aviation Administration, none in the past 10 years appear to have zeroed in on the component that failed, according to agency records. The American flight had accelerated to 154 miles (248 kilometers) an hour before the pilots began applying the brakes, according to NTSB. It came to a stop about 25 seconds later. Fire crews arrived on scene and started applying foam to the burning jet fuel within 2 minutes and 51 seconds of being notified of the emergency, NTSB said. The fire burned so hot that the right wing partially collapsed. Southwest Incident If contamination exists within metal structures, that can weaken them and allow a crack to form, according to previous NTSB investigations. Repeatedly flexing or stressing the crack can cause it to grow in what is known as fatigue cracking. The NTSB said it found evidence of fatigue in the CF6 disk fragments it examined. The NTSB is also investigating another so-called uncontained engine failure that occurred on Aug. 27 on a Southwest Airlines Co. plane, which was forced to make an emergency landing in Pensacola, Florida. The CFM56 engine in the Southwest incident was built by CFM International Inc., a joint venture between GE and Safran SA. The CFM56 family, used on narrowbody aircraft, is separate from the CF6.

Britain is part of the European consortium producing the Eurofighter Typhoon. […] By: Huma Siddiqui | New Delhi | Published: November 5, 2016 6:23 AM The aircraft is designed and built by a consortium of European aerospace manufacturers. With India seeking more than 300 fighter jets for the Indian Air Force (IAF), the British offer of the Eurofighter Typhoon is expected to be part of discussions when during UK Prime Minister Theresa May’s first ever meeting with Prime Minister Modi next week. Britain is part of the European consortium producing the Eurofighter Typhoon. It may be recalled that in 2015, former UK Prime Minister David Cameron had offered the Eurofighter Typhoon and help Hindustan Aeronautics (HAL) develop worldclass fighter jets in India as part of the ‘Make in India’ initiative. The Eurofighter Typhoon and Dassault Aviation Rafale were short-listed by the Indian Air Force (IAF) in 2011 as part of its medium multi-role combat aircraft competition (MMRCA), but Rafale was finally announced as the preferred bidder in 2011. Though the MMRCA request for proposal (RFP) was scrapped eventually last year, India recently signed an agreement with the French company to buying 36 Rafale combat aircraft off the shelf. Sources told FE, “No decision has been firmed up for the kind of fighter planes India wants for the IAF — single-engine or twin-engine. This leaves scope for all aerospace majors to look at the Indian market again. Three companies have already made presentations to the government and have expressed willingness to transfer technology and to make in India.” In 2011, six contenders for the MMRCA including the Boeing F/A-18 E/F Super Hornet, Dassault Rafale, Eurofighter Typhoon, Lockheed Martin F-16 Block 60, Swedish Saab Gripen, and Russian RSK MiG-35, had undergone exhaustive trials. At the end of the trials, the IAF made its choice clear to the government on the kind of fighter jets it needs. The frontrunners were the Eurofighter Typhoon and the Rafale. The Eurofighter Typhoon is a twin-engine, multi-role canard-delta air-superiority fighter aircraft, designed and built by a consortium of European aerospace manufacturers through Eurofighter GmbH. On offer was the Tranche-3 Typhoon for the Indian requirement, equipped with the CAESAR AESA radar. Besides the Eurofighter, the visiting leader is expected to talk about the existing defence programmes between the two countries including the BAE Systems and a Mahindra group tie-up for the assembling of M-777 guns. According to the official MEA spokesperson Vikas Swarup, “Prime minister of UK Theresa May would be visiting India during November 6-8, 2016. This is her first bilateral visit outside the EU. She will hold bilateral talks with Prime Minister Narendra Modi.” May, along with Modi, will inaugurate the India-UK Tech Summit on November 7 in New Delhi. The decision to hold the India-UK Tech Summit was agreed to during the visit of Modi to UK in November 2015. The Summit is being organised by the Department of Science and Technology and CII, and it demonstrates the importance and expanse of science and technology cooperation in India-UK partnership. At the summit, government officials, business leaders and scientists will engage to see how best S&T collaboration could be leveraged to open up new opportunities for bilateral business, trade and investment. New initiatives on deepening science and technology collaboration between India and UK will be announced at the Summit. Also, a meeting of the Joint Economic and Trade Committee (JETCO), chaired by MOS for commerce and industry Nirmala Sitharaman and UK secretary of state for international trade Liam Fox, will be held during the visit.

Ro McGonegal Nov 4, 2016 0 Comment(s) Share View Full Gallery This car entered the Johnson family collection in 2002. While he was away at college, TJ Johnson’s dad and brother bought it in Defiance, Iowa, for $700. They got it from a woman named Dixie Shanahan, a woman with an abusive spouse. Eventually, she killed him and then went about selling off all his cars. The episode was chronicled in a true crime novel called Dixie’s Last Stand. Suffice that TJ’s dad was called to testify at the murder trial. “My in-laws lovingly refer to the Malibu as the Dead Man’s Car, but that’s only one of its few nicknames,” quipped TJ. To be sure, there have been literally dozens of Chevrolets, from pre-War old to current, entertained by the Johnson family, but this car TJ can’t quit and has clung to him with the tenacity of a vestigial remain. “In the time I’ve owned it, it’s had four iterations, more or less, each defined by what engine was in it,” TJ cracked. 2/40 3/40 “I often get told that it’s deceptively quick. I don’t necessarily think the car’s a sleeper. It’s visible. It has a rollbar, slicks and skinnies, and the license plate says NOS. But the interior and rollbar are very tidy. The nitrous bits underhood are tastefully out of sight and the exhaust note is pretty tame. It feels good to catch people off guard and hear the things they say once they understand what it’s all about.” Since we have neither the space nor the inclination to detail the entire history, let’s just step off from where he took it on. “This car was rather complete, though sans motor and transmission, and we had plenty of parts around to get it running,” he said. “With a four-bolt-main 350 and a decent buff-job on the paint, this became my daily driver through my senior year of college and into the professional working world when I started at Holley in January 2004 as a Research Engineer.” 4/40 5/40 6/40 While in Bowling Green, he touched up the interior, re-covering the back seat, fixing the door panels, and swapping out the sun-faded carpet. He hauled it to Jamie Blubaugh in Augusta, Kansas, for a six-point rollbar installation. Then the car went to Roger Bosley for paint. Since the majority of the sheetmetal was new and the quarter seams were well-done by Bruce Philbrook (Maize, Kansas), the car basically only needed “straightening” by way of several coats of high-build primer and block sanding. An Impala SS TJ saw parked at a pet store turned him to the color: Laser Blue Metallic. As the world turned, so did employment for this aerospace engineer. In 2005, he accepted an offer from Boeing in Wichita. After a slew of small-blocks, he thought he saw sparks from an LS arcing on the horizon. He grabbed an LQ4 and parted out the 383 stuff to fund the 6.0 junkyard jewel—ported heads, Lunati cam, Holley swap oil pan and motor mounts, headers, intake manifold, NOS plate, and Dominator ECU and harnesses. Prior to the winter of 2010-2011 TJ got hooked up with an episode of Pinks. Their rules forbade any coolant other than water cut slightly with antifreeze. Abnormal cold cracked the lifter valley, so in the 2013-2014 off-season, he went on the hunt gathering parts for a serious Brian Tooley-built 416-inch LS. 7/40 8/40 9/40 He also signed up for the 2014 Drag Week epic but had no desire to pull a trailer. He reclaimed trunk space, situating a Rick’s stainless tank with 450-l/hr in-tank pump under the floor. He wanted full-length tailpipes but the ARB Air Locker links occupied the space where they would pass over the rear axle. He fixed that with a UMI 1 3/8-inch under-axle bolt-in drag bar. He reworked the suspension with TRZ chrome-moly drag racing upper and lower control arms and TRZ billet steering arms (to improve bumpsteer), Viking double-adjustable coilovers, and Wilwood Dynalite brakes. Though he usually punches a Powerglide, for the Drag Week SR SB NA class (Street Race Small-Block Normally Aspirated) he put up a reverse-pattern, trans-brake-equipped Turbo 400. So how’d that trek transpire? Besides losing a tailshaft housing bushing on I-35 on Day Two and hurting a gearset on Day Four, he ended up finishing Fourth in SR SB NA with a five-day average of 10.97 at 121, set a personal NA best of 10.71 at 123.6 … and made several new hot rodding friends. Before closing the 2014 season, with the ’Glide back in, the Dyno Dynamics eddy current chassis rollers netted 530 horsepower on nuts and 755 on squeeze. 10/40 11/40 The fussin’ didn’t stop there. In 2015, with the car finally final, he ran a nitrous best of 9.62 at 140 on a relatively small shot. Then, at Street Legal Shootout in June, he set a new True Radial personal best of 10.75 at 138 on True Street hard-compound mud and snow rated Futura Super Sport 275/60 tires—not drag radials. He finished runner-up at that event. He attended a variety of local and regional street car gatherings, winning three or four Sunday Fundays to the tune of $1,000. But the ultimate achievement took place in Oklahoma City at the inaugural Outlaw Armageddon No Prep race and winning the Pure Street class, a new favorite trophy, and $1,600 to boot! (As of this writing, TJ has since hit the quarter-mile and upped the nitrous dose with a 250-shot and additional chassis tuning and was able to muster up the car’s best lap ever with a 9.24 e.t. at 146 mph.) 12/40 Tech Check Owner: TJ Johnson, Wichita, Kansas Vehicle: 1967 Malibu Engine Type: LS3 Displacement: 416 ci Compression Ratio: 11.3:1 Bore: 4.070 inches Stroke: 4.000 inches Cylinder Heads: LS9 Roto-cast, CNC-ported by Wegner Automotive, 2.165-inch LS3 lightweight intake valves, 1.590-inch LY9 Inconel exhaust valves Rotating Assembly: K1 forged crankshaft and lightweight H-beam rods, Wiseco pistons Valvetrain: 1.7:1 rocker arms, Brian Tooley Racing (BTR) lifters, 0.660-inch lift springs and 3/8x7.400-inch chrome-moly pushrods Camshaft: BTR-spec ground by Comp Cams (243/258-deg. duration at 0.050; 0.627/0.615-inch lift), Comp adjustable single-row timing gear, LS3 rocker covers Induction: Mast Motorsports CNC 4150LS3EFI intake manifold, Holley Billet 4150 1,000-cfm throttle body, Siemens Deka 60 lb/hr injectors, Edelbrock Pro-Flo air cleaner, NOS dry system, Nitrous Outlet 4150 Stinger plate, Rick’s Stainless tank, Walbro 450-l/hr in-tank pump, Holley billet Dominator bypass regulator Ignition: GM LS3 coils, Holley V2 Dominator ECU Exhaust: BRP/Muscle Rods headers, 2-inch primary pipes, 3.5-inch collectors (ceramic coated by Performance Coatings Plus (Joplin, MO)), Hooker X-pipe, 3-inch system, Hooker Aero Chamber mufflers, system built by Kevin’s American Muffler (Wichita, KS) Ancillaries: Holley 6-qt. oil pan modified for stroker clearance with baffle, All Star catch-can, LS3 alternator, rebuilt factory radiator, ported Melling oil pump, C6 Corvette water pump, SPAL fans Output: 533 rwhp on motor, 755 rwhp on juice Machine Work: Big Mike’s Speed & Performance, Darrel’s Automotive, Smith Auto Machine & Supply, Duane Saum Engineering Tuner: Wichita Dyno Drivetrain Transmission: TCI Auto flexplate, Trans Specialties Proline 5000 Powerglide maintained by Rick Bills, Neal Chance 5,100-stall 9-inch bolt-together converter, TSI Pro-Lite trans brake Rear Axle: Ford 9-inch w/ Strange Engineering S-Series carrier, billet pinion support, and 1350 yoke; Motive Gear 3.89:1 ratio; spool; Moser 33-spline axles; Motorsports Innovations driveshaft speed sensor/collar; Driveshaft Shop 3.25-inch carbon-fiber driveshaft Chassis Front Suspension: Stock spindles; TRZ upper and lower control arms, billet steering arms and bumpsteer kit; Viking double-adjustable coilovers (450 lb-in springs); six-point Holzman Racecars Chevelle main hoop; custom rear bars and door bars by Jamie Blubaugh (Augusta, KS) Rear Suspension: Hypercoil springs (125 lb-in), Viking double-adjustable shocks, Wolfe Racecraft adjustable spring perches, UMI double-adjustable upper and lower control arms and 1 3/8-inch under-axle antisway bar Brakes: Wilwood 12.19-inch rotors, Dynalite four-piston calipers front and rear; Chrysler-style master cylinder; Wilwood proportioning valve Wheels & Tires Wheels: Weld RTS 15x4 front, 15x9.33 rear Tires: M/T Sportsman S/R 26x6 front, Hoosier Quick Time Pro 28x11.5 rear Interior Upholstery: Scott Downey (front seats), Matt Baker (headliner), TJ Johnson (back seat cover) Material: PUI Interiors replacement vinyl, new foam Seats: Stock with G-Force five-point harness Steering: Factory wheel refurbished Dash: Factory gauge cluster Instrumentation: Shiftworks SS gauges; Holley air/fuel, fuel pressure, and Nitrous Works on A-pillar Audio: Original radio-delete plate HVAC: Windows down Exterior Bodywork: Bruce Philbrook (Maize, KS); finish work by Roger Bosley (formerly of Haysville, KS) Paint by: Roger Bosley Paint: PPG Laser Blue Metallic, DBS base, DBU clearcoat Hood: Goodmark steel 2-inch cowl Grille: YearOne repro Bumpers: YearOne repro MORE PHOTOS VIEW FULL GALLERY PHOTO GALLERY (40) X View Full Image Facebook Twitter Google+ Email Read the Article: COMMENTS Connect With Us Get Latest News and Articles.

Back to site Election 2016 Climate Change Carbon tax The Carbon Tax on the Ballot in Washington State Is Not the Right Way to Deal With Global Warming A revenue-neutral carbon tax simply cannot deliver the massive green-energy investments we all need. By Naomi KleinTwitter November 4, 2016 Facebook Twitter Email Print Smoke rising from the Eggborough Power Station. (John Giles / PA Wire) The imperatives of the climate crisis and the logic of economic austerity are at war—and Washington State is on the front lines.1 Ad Policy So-called “revenue-neutral” carbon pricing—whereby the proceeds are used to fund tax cuts—has long been a cherished hobbyhorse of free-market economists and the odd Republican who favors climate action. It’s also the policy of choice for big polluters like ExxonMobil. And now this right-wing friendly model is being pushed in Washington State, thanks to Initiative 732.2 I-732, on the ballot on November 8, would be the first revenue-neutral price on carbon in the United States. It is widely unpopular among the state’s Democrats, Republicans, and even the business lobby, and has only managed to win the support of one significant environmental group. But on the off chance it is approved by voters, it would be a disastrous precedent that could set back the climate justice movement for a decade—time that we simply can’t afford to lose.3 Some have accepted the logic that something is better than nothing, even arguing that a “tax swap” could substitute for a just transition to a low-carbon economy. The evidence proves otherwise. In British Columbia, two-thirds of the tax cuts have ended up in corporate pockets, while carbon emissions have been rising in recent years and the fracking industry has boomed.4 By some estimates, I-732 would raise gasoline and electricity prices less than 15 percent by 2040 in Washington State—hardly enough to jumpstart an urgent, sweeping phase-out of fossil fuels. Meanwhile, it would offset carbon revenues by cutting taxes for big corporations, including major polluters. (According to the Seattle Times, Boeing could see windfalls of tens of millions annually.) 5 And while polluters get rewarded, the communities of color that have born the brunt of fossil fuel pollution, and the working people whose jobs are at risk as we move away from fossil fuels, are left empty handed. The money raised by the tax won’t be used to fund green jobs in low-income communities, or to retrain workers currently in high carbon sectors. In other words, this is the epitome of an unjust transition.6 LIKE THIS? GET MORE OF OUR BEST REPORTING AND ANALYSIS In fact, this “neutral” tax might not even break even, with a state government analysis concluding it would blow a $797.2 million hole in Washington’s budget over six fiscal years—this at a time when the legislature is under court orders to fix its failure to adequately fund education. So rather than the equitable green transition that has long been promised (better and more affordable public transit, community controlled renewable energy…), low income communities could well end up with even more eroded services than they have now.7 The backers of I-732 are running on a pessimistic platform of “just do something,” preying on the real urgency that so many of us feel in the face of the climate crisis. But sometimes “something” is worse than nothing, especially if it will stand in the way of better proposals down the road.8 A paltry, revenue-neutral carbon tax simply cannot deliver the massive green energy investments and community-driven solutions we all need. Science-based climate action means an unprecedented, rapid, and decisive shift to renewables; a truly equitable carbon tax can play an important role in spurring the transition, but it won’t work unless we make the polluters pay, and put their immoral profits to work repairing the damage they have knowingly created. The way to do that is to mobilize the broadest possible coalition—led by the front-line communities who stand to benefit most from building a cleaner and fairer economy.9 “Don’t let the perfect be the enemy of the good,” I-732 proponents like to say. It sounds good, but it is not what opponents of this initiative are doing. “Perfect” is not on the table—we lost that option when climate action was delayed for decades. So much time has been lost, in fact, that now we have just one shot to get the policy right. And that means we can’t let the politically difficult be the enemy of the scientifically and socially necessary. 7 Comments Facebook Twitter Email Print Naomi Klein Twitter Naomi Klein is a columnist for The Nation.

It's also supported by numerous environmental groups and one of this nation's leading climate scientists, Dr. James Hansen. It's been endorsed by James Murray (Professor), Founding Director UW Program on Climate Change, University of Washington. It's supported by a coalition of local environmental groups that have been fighting tooth and nail to stop the expansion of coal ports - and largely winning. Is it perfect? No. https://yeson732.org/endorsements-expanded/ (15)(0) Robert Borneman says: November 5, 2016 at 1:15 am Naomi - I love your work, but here I will disagree. This is at least one step in the right direction. It is flawed, yes, but it is a positive vector. (19)(3) Chris Darling says: November 5, 2016 at 2:24 pm Absolutely agree. I am distressed and angry that lots of people who I usually agree with are arguing strenuously against this carbon tax. But none of them have been able to institute any of the "better policies" that they so vigorously support. Start with this carbon tax, then build on it. That is nearly always how reform and positive change begins anyway. (13)(0) Charles Rosengard says: November 5, 2016 at 4:10 pm Micromanaging taxation and spending by initiative is really bad policy...for one thing, initiatives are hard to change once passed. It would have been far better to ask for a tax and then direct the legislature to make it revenue neutral. That would have prevented the current problem of blowing a hole in the state budget. I would urge the backers to try again with this approach. That way you wouldn't have public sector unions campaigning against you. (0)(5) Roger Hoffmann says: November 4, 2016 at 7:32 pm Thanks for this well-considered argument. I'm not in Washington and was unaware of the initiative. This presents arguments that I might well not have heard...and makes me more wary of the "revenue-neutral" carbon tax notion...something that heretofore had seemed to me a reasonable approach. I shall be better prepared going forward. (5)(8) Election 2016 Climate Change Carbon tax Today 6:00 am Now That They’ve Been Proven Wrong, Will Putin’s Demonizers Apologize for Their Slanders?

Behind each table, a friendly face greets those who approach, offering to answer any questions they may have about the organization they represent and the opportunities it can offer. The 20th Force Support Squadron held their annual Job and Education Fair at the Carolina Skies Club and Conference Center here, Oct. 27. “The goal of the event is to connect job and education seekers with different vendors to get information about education opportunities and the job market in the local area,” said Erica Brown, 20th FSS Airman and Family Readiness Center (AFRC) community readiness specialist. “We had a variety of different vendors at the fair this year; everything from Boeing plane manufacturing to the University of South Carolina Sumter.” In all, representatives from 54 higher-learning institutions and businesses in Sumter County were present to answer questions Team Shaw members had about everything from tuition rates to hiring processes. “It was cool to see the different options available locally,” said Morgan Rice, military spouse. “I’ve never been in this part of the country, but my husband was recently stationed here, so it’s nice to know I can pursue my education or get a nice job in town while he’s working on base.” Brown said members of the military community have a unique skillset that employers and universities are generally eager to take advantage of, and hopes speaking to the vendors at the fair gave Team Shaw personnel some insight into the opportunities available outside the gate. “Exposure is important,” said Brown. “Sometimes as members of the military community, we stay in the military bubble and don’t think to look for opportunities in the local community. It’s good for Team Shaw members to be exposed to the different employment and education opportunities in the area.” Though the Job and Education Fair is held only once per year, resources such as the AFRC and the Education Center are available to Team Shaw members year-round. Contact the AFRC at (803) 895-1253 or the Education Center at (803) 895-1838 for more information.

Please send us your startup announcements. Email is best: newchicagobusiness@gmail.com. Crain's contributor Robert Loerzel brings you news of fresh local startups every week. While she was on maternity leave from a job at Procter & Gamble, Chicagoan Allison Robinson decided to create the Mom Project, a website that matches women who want flexible work with project-based opportunities at companies. “It's challenging work with an emphasis on flexibility,” says Robinson, who left her job at P&G to launch the startup. “We're really trying to redefine the workplace for moms. It hasn't been very friendly.” Since the Mom Project launched in April, about 7,000 professionals have signed up for the website's free job-seeking service. “They're highly educated,” Robinson says. “They come from really great professional backgrounds, such as Boeing, Google, McDonald's, etc. They're so happy to stay on their career track but also be at home.” More than 150 companies are participating in the website, paying a fee to the Mom Project when they make a hire. Chicagoan Kimberly Grotto Howard, who owns Grotto Marketing, used the Mom Project to line up a work project with Braeside Condominium Management. She says she likes the tone that the Mom Project sets in conversations between job-seekers and employers. “It's almost like they look at you like a human being rather than a machine—from the beginning,” she says. Hidden down an alley in Evanston, The Barn opened for business Tuesday, Nov. 1, serving what it calls a “meat-centric” menu. The restaurant is inside a 19th-century brick barn at the rear of 1016 Church St. that once housed the stable of delivery horses for Borden Condensed Milk Co. The Barn's proprietor is Amy Morton, daughter of Arnie Morton, who founded Morton's Steakhouses, and the chef is Nicole Pederson. They're the same team that opened Found restaurant in Evanston four years ago. Barrington startup F3 Cycling seeks to raise $45,000 on Kickstarter to manufacture the FormMount Bicycle Computer Mount—an adjustable mount that holds GPS devices of any size above the handlebars of a bicycle. The campaign, which ends Nov. 20, has raised about $28,000 so far for the mount, which was created by Tim Boundy, Frank Pistorio and Mike Scalise. It's available for pledges starting at $43. The Apothecary is a deck of playing cards that change color when touched by hands. It's the creation of Chicagoan Alexander Chin, who runs Seasons Playing Cards and the Shung Shung package design studio. Chin has raised more than $50,000 with a Kickstarter campaign to launch the color-changing playing cards, more than meeting his $20,000 goal. With heat-sensitive technology, the cards will turn from juniper green to yellow or coral to lavender when they're handled. The cards are available for pledges starting at $14 while the campaign runs, through Nov. 16. Other new businesses we've spotted: Tytin Jewelry, a shop and studio, has opened at 4825 N. Western Ave. in Lincoln Square. In addition to offering her own jewelry, owner Tina Cannon sells pieces created by other independent designers as well as jewelry-making tools. And Tytin hosts workshops and provides studio space for jewelers to work. . . . Chicago-based Aligned Modern Health opened its eighth local wellness clinic on Tuesday, Nov. 1, at 1335 S. Michigan Ave. in the South Loop. Update: We reported earlier this year about Musically Human Theatre coming to Highland Park, but as Crain's now reports, the theater company has closed without producing a single show.

Bloomberg 11/4/2016 Justin Bachman © Eric Thayer/Getty Images File photo of Delta Airlines planes sit at John F. Kennedy Airport, July 22, 2014, in New York City As space in economy class becomes ever more constrained, airlines have devised a more spacious cabin product for passengers priced out of business class but determined to escape the indignities of steerage. Called “premium economy,” this section of added frills between coach and business aims to address a widening gap that has emerged between those cabins—and to extract more money from passengers. The premium economy cabin has been a staple of large international airlines for several years but is just now beginning to appear on American carriers. Quotes in the article Boeing Co BA ▼ 148.11 -1.88 -1.25% American Airlines Group Inc AAL ▲ 44.76 +1.36 +3.13% B/E Aerospace Inc BEAV ▼ 59.14 -0.03 -0.05% Singapore Airlines Ltd SINGY ▼ 13.57 -0.44 -3.11% Airlines across the globe have rushed to add premium economy cabins in recent years, as customers show a willingness to pay for extra space and amenities. “There’s a demand for something in between economy and business,” American Airlines Group Inc. spokesman Joshua Freed said on Thursday during a tour of the new 787-9 at Dallas-Ft. Worth Airport. The plane is a larger, 285-seat version of the 787-8 American first received early last year. On almost every airline with premium economy, the biggest lure is increased seat pitch and width, typically along with nicer food and tableware, a larger entertainment screen, noise-canceling or reducing headphones, a fancier amenities kit, and occasionally, a more generous baggage allowance. A pre-flight beverage is usually included. Some airlines also let premium economy passengers use their airport lounges for an additional fee. American is the first U.S. airline to introduce the new cabin , on its Boeing 787-9, with 21 seats in a 2-3-2 across layout, far roomier than the 3-3-3 arrangement in the back of the plane. American uses the same 19-inch wide B/E Aerospace Inc.  MiQ seat for first class on some of its domestic aircraft, which further sharpens the contrast with the airline’s regular, 17-inch wide 787 economy seats. The new cabin offers 38 inches of seat pitch, and a six-inch recline. Each seat also comes with an 11-inch screen, two inches larger than what you get in back, and those blessed noise-reducing headphones. (Passengers in the 787-9’s business class get noise-canceling versions and a 15.4-inch screen.) Big money maker In terms of revenue, the cabins are ingenious, given that fares typically are hundreds of dollars more than regular economy, with only marginally higher cost. For example, Singapore Airlines Ltd., is charging more than $3,900 round-trip for premium economy in early December—almost $2000 more than economy on its new nonstop flight from San Francisco to Singapore. Qantas Airways Ltd.’s premium economy fare over the same period is nearly $1,500 above the $2,411 round-trip for flights from Los Angeles to Brisbane, Australia. Singapore, which started its premium economy service this summer, prices the cabin about 40 percent to 50 percent above economy seats, spokesman James Boyd said. The largest sales, so far, have come on the longest routes and have appealed to many customers who are traveling for work, he said. American’s first 787-9 international flight with the new cabin took place on Thursday from Dallas to São Paulo. The 787-9s will also be deployed from American’s Texas hub to Madrid, Paris, and Seoul. American’s new Airbus A350s will come with premium economy as well, and the carrier plans to retrofit almost all of its long-haul international fleet—777s, 787-8s, and Airbus A330s—with premium economy by the end of 2018.  American plans to roll out new fares for the cabin in mid-January. Until then, it is selling them as part of its regular extra-legroom seats. American officials declined to discuss fares for the new cabin. Delta Air Lines Inc. plans to fly its new premium economy product next autumn on new Airbus A350s, followed by Boeing 777s in 2018. Delta said on Thursday that its premium economy seats will be 19 inches wide, with 38 inches of pitch and a seven-inch recline, and will come with a Tumi amenity kit and a Westin in-flight blanket. A spokesman for United Continental Holdings Inc., Jonathan Guerin, said the company has no announcements about premium economy. “We continually evaluate the products and services we offer our customers throughout their journey,” he said. Someone has to pay While premium economy represents a silver lining for travelers hoping to improve economy-class travel, there’s a downside for those who are fine with flying cattle class. For some airlines, the “nicer” coach cabin could represent an incentive to make regular economy even more spartan. If you squeeze a bit more in the back, in other words, maybe a few more people will be induced to spring an additional $300 or $500 to move into premium economy. Another possible consequence of this three-tiered world could involve carry-ons. Some Wall Street analysts have long wondered why numerous airlines that gleefully charge for a first checked bag domestically still have no fee for that same bag on many international routes. Premium economy could become the gateway to further differentiate cabins. Joe Kiely, Delta’s managing director of product and customer experience, said the Atlanta-based airline is not planning “to materially change” the attributes of its economy cabin as the premium version starts to fly. American’s Freed said his airline isn’t considering changes to economy as a result of the new cabin. For travelers, the question really becomes: Is it worth it? Is a six-hour flight too short to pony up for the extra room? What about 10 or 11 hours? And if the economy seat is fine for you, does a slightly larger video screen or a glass of wine before departure matter?  “The value proposition is all about the space on board,” said Seth Miller, a frequent traveler and travel writer , noting that some aspects of premium economy can be purchased à la carte.  “But space is not something so easily acquired once on the plane.” Go to MSN Home More in Money 20 tips for saving money at the grocery store U.S. News & World Report - Money Amazing Airstreams: The coolest tiny homes on wheels Lovemoney 8 ways President Trump will affect Wall Street U.S. News & World Report - Money 6 reasons to think twice before moving to Canada MarketWatch The 10 most expensive prescription drugs in America Fiscal Times How China's richest man is buying up the world Lovemoney AdChoices AdChoices Home News Weather Entertainment Sports Money Lifestyle Health & Fitness Food & Drink Travel Autos Video election 2016 © 2016 Microsoft Privacy Legal About our Ads Feedback Help MSN Worldwide Newsletter

It must do better on technology. Written by Edward Alden Senior fellow, Council on Foreign Relations & Vivek Wadhwa Director of Research, Duke University's Center for Entrepreneurship and Research Commercialization Obsession 2016 November 04, 2016 Employees work at a production line inside a factory of Saic GM Wuling, in China. (Reuters/Norihiko Shirouzu) Share Written by Edward Alden Senior fellow, Council on Foreign Relations & Vivek Wadhwa Director of Research, Duke University's Center for Entrepreneurship and Research Commercialization Obsession 2016 November 04, 2016 Global trade and investment have been great engines of progress for much of the world. Over the past two decades, poorer countries reduced the gap between themselves and their richer counterparts for the first time since the Industrial Revolution, in no small part because of the opportunities opened by global trade. Technology has the same transformative potential in industries as varied as energy, health care, transportation and education. New inventions that are imminent or already here could transform the lives of billions of people for the better. Yet, as we see in the 2016 US election campaign, and as we have seen in Europe and elsewhere, rapid change has a dark side. If too many people are unable to adapt quickly and successfully to these changes, they will push back— blaming trade or immigrants or the elites—and demand a reversion to a simpler time. The task of governments is to help people manage these transformations so that they benefit many and do as little harm as possible. In the United States, governments mostly failed at that task during the era of globalization; if the full benefits of the coming technologies are to be enjoyed, governments will have to do much better this time around. The competitive pressures create by globalization should have been no surprise. About 45 years ago, president Richard Nixon’s top international economic adviser, Pete Peterson, warned him that rising competition from Japan and Germany, with much more on the way, “poses adjustment policy which simply cannot be ignored.” Americans have unquestionably gained by the lower prices and higher quality that import competition enabled. Apple iPhones and the latest Boeing jets are the result of the collective input of tens of thousands of collaborators in dozens of countries around the world. But many lost well-paid manufacturing jobs to import competition or outsourcing, and the US government has made little effort to mitigate those costs, even in worker retraining. President John F. Kennedy promised in 1962 that the government would help American workers who lost out to trade competition as the United States lowered its barriers to imports. “When considerations of national policy make it desirable to avoid higher tariffs, those injured by the competition should not be required to bear the full brunt of the impact,” he said. But today, the United States spends a smaller proportion of its wealth on worker retraining than any of the other 34 member countries of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development except for Mexico and Chile. Too often, the attitude of the US government has been deeply irresponsible, assuming that markets would simply sort everything out for the best. In the long run, everybody may end up with work and income, but in the short run, as Peterson told Nixon, the failure to help Americans adapt to the new reality will “leave long periods when the transition is painful beyond endurance.” With technology change, too, we know well in advance exactly what is coming. Driverless technology, for example, will soon become the standard in the trucking industry. Driverless trucks can run 24 hours a day and won’t demand overtime pay. There are 3.5 million truck drivers in the United States, and an additional 5.5 million jobs in related industries—roughly one in every 15 American workers. They could perhaps go to work for UPS or deliver pizzas, but many of those delivery jobs will be lost to drones. Personal-care robots will increasingly replace home health-care aides, and self-checkout machines are already replacing retail-store clerks; these are jobs that filled some of the gap left by the disappearance of manufacturing jobs to global competition, but they, too, will soon be under siege. Automation is even hitting law and education, two sectors long thought immune to technological substitution. These vulnerabilities necessitate something that too often was absent in the era of globalization: good public policies. Artificial intelligence will transform teaching, for example, but without access to the highest-speed broadband, students in poor and rural areas will fall further behind their urban counterparts. And unless we strengthen social safety nets and retraining schemes, there will be far too many losers in the labor market. There is no way to avoid the huge impact that technology will have on employment; we have to prepare for it and help those whose skills it antiquates. Much more even than globalization, technology is going to create upheaval and destroy industries and jobs. This can be for the better, helping us create new and more interesting jobs or freeing up time for leisure and artistic pursuits. But unless we find ways to share the prosperity and help Americans adapt to the coming changes, many could be left worse off than they are. And, as we have seen this year, that is a recipe for an angry backlash—and political upheaval. A version of this piece originally appeared on the Washington Post. Follow Vivek on Twitter at @wadhwa.

On almost every airline with premium economy, the biggest lure is increased seat pitch and width, typically along with nicer food and tableware, a larger entertainment screen, noise-canceling or reducing headphones, a fancier amenities kit, and occasionally, a more generous baggage allowance. A pre-flight beverage is usually included. Some airlines also let premium economy passengers use their airport lounges for an additional fee. American Airlines Premium Economy. Source: American Airlines American is the first U.S. airline to introduce the new cabin, on its Boeing 787-9, with 21 seats in a 2-3-2 across layout, far roomier than the 3-3-3 arrangement in the back of the plane. American uses the same 19-inch wide B/E Aerospace Inc. MiQ seat for first class on some of its domestic aircraft, which further sharpens the contrast with the airline’s regular, 17-inch wide 787 economy seats. The new cabin offers 38 inches of seat pitch, and a six-inch recline. Each seat also comes with an 11-inch screen, two inches larger than what you get in back, and those blessed noise-reducing headphones. (Passengers in the 787-9’s business class get noise-canceling versions and a 15.4-inch screen.) Big money maker In terms of revenue, the cabins are ingenious, given that fares typically are hundreds of dollars more than regular economy, with only marginally higher cost. For example, Singapore Airlines Ltd., is charging more than $3,900 round-trip for premium economy in early December—almost $2000 more than economy on its new nonstop flight from San Francisco to Singapore. Qantas Airways Ltd.’s premium economy fare over the same period is nearly $1,500 above the $2,411 round-trip for flights from Los Angeles to Brisbane, Australia. Singapore, which started its premium economy service this summer, prices the cabin about 40 percent to 50 percent above economy seats, spokesman James Boyd said. The largest sales, so far, have come on the longest routes and have appealed to many customers who are traveling for work, he said. American’s first 787-9 international flight with the new cabin took place on Thursday from Dallas to São Paulo. The 787-9s will also be deployed from American’s Texas hub to Madrid, Paris, and Seoul. American’s new Airbus A350s will come with premium economy as well, and the carrier plans to retrofit almost all of its long-haul international fleet—777s, 787-8s, and Airbus A330s—with premium economy by the end of 2018. American plans to roll out new fares for the cabin in mid-January. Until then, it is selling them as part of its regular extra-legroom seats. American officials declined to discuss fares for the new cabin. Delta Air Lines Inc. plans to fly its new premium economy product next autumn on new Airbus A350s, followed by Boeing 777s in 2018. Delta said on Thursday that its premium economy seats will be 19 inches wide, with 38 inches of pitch and a seven-inch recline, and will come with a Tumi amenity kit and a Westin in-flight blanket. A spokesman for United Continental Holdings Inc., Jonathan Guerin, said the company has no announcements about premium economy. “We continually evaluate the products and services we offer our customers throughout their journey,” he said. Someone has to pay While premium economy represents a silver lining for travelers hoping to improve economy-class travel, there’s a downside for those who are fine with flying cattle class. For some airlines, the “nicer” coach cabin could represent an incentive to make regular economy even more spartan. If you squeeze a bit more in the back, in other words, maybe a few more people will be induced to spring an additional $300 or $500 to move into premium economy. Another possible consequence of this three-tiered world could involve carry-ons. Some Wall Street analysts have long wondered why numerous airlines that gleefully charge for a first checked bag domestically still have no fee for that same bag on many international routes. Premium economy could become the gateway to further differentiate cabins. Joe Kiely, Delta’s managing director of product and customer experience, said the Atlanta-based airline is not planning “to materially change” the attributes of its economy cabin as the premium version starts to fly. American’s Freed said his airline isn’t considering changes to economy as a result of the new cabin. For travelers, the question really becomes: Is it worth it? Is a six-hour flight too short to pony up for the extra room? What about 10 or 11 hours? And if the economy seat is fine for you, does a slightly larger video screen or a glass of wine before departure matter?  “The value proposition is all about the space on board,” said Seth Miller, a frequent traveler and travel writer, noting that some aspects of premium economy can be purchased à la carte. “But space is not something so easily acquired once on the plane.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Skip to content Satellite Press Releases Satellite Press Releases and News Air Cargo Containers Industry Global Market by Container Type, Material, Region, Country Analysis Forecast 2021 Studies the global air cargo containers market over the period 2010 to 2021. PUNE, INDIA, November 4, 2016 /EINPresswire.com/ — Global Air Cargo Containers Market Studies the global air cargo containers market over the period 2010 to 2021. The report provides detailed insights on the market dynamics to enable informed business decision making and growth strategy formulation based on the opportunities present in the market. The Global Air Cargo Containers Market: Highlights Cargo is an essential part of the airline business today. It contributes roughly 9% of the airline revenues which is more than twice the revenues generated from the first class segment. There are several types of unit load device (ULDs), such as containers, pallets, car racks, and stalls used to load the luggage, freight, and other items in an aircraft. Cargo is carried in the lower deck in a passenger aircraft whereas it is also carried on the main deck in a cargo aircraft. Try Sample Report @ https://www.wiseguyreports.com/sample-request/636806-global-air-cargo-containers-opportunity-2016-2021 Cargo container is the most important unit load device (ULD) type and is compatible with narrow body and wide body aircraft. It is highly suitable to load perishable goods, pharmaceutical items, and live animals on an aircraft to transport from one destination to another. The biggest benefit of an air cargo container is that it allows to bundle a large quantity of cargo into a single unit. This helps to minimize the airlines’ operational cost by saving the ground crew’s time and efforts. The number of cargo containers on an aircraft depends on several factors, such as type of aircraft, type of containers, and combination of unit load device. The global air cargo containers market offers an attractive growth opportunity and is expected to grow at 4.3% CAGR during the forecast period of 2016 to 2021. Growing cargo traffic owning to increasing urbanization and rising disposable income, increasing demand for lightweight containers, and advancement in technology are some of the major drivers of the market. The global air cargo containers are segmented into five categories: LD3, LD6, LD11, M1, and Others. There are several types of containers used on the passenger and cargo aircraft. The selection of container type is highly dependent on the type of aircraft and combination of unit load device (ULDs). LD3 is the most widely preferred container type in both passenger and cargo aircraft and is highly compatible with Boeing and Airbus wide body aircraft, such as B747, B767, B777, B787, DC-10, MD-11, A330, A350XWB, and A380. LD3 can also be alternatively used by replacing other container type. Containers are used in the both lower hold as well as main deck in an aircraft. Passenger aircraft uses mainly lower hold for containers, whereas cargo aircraft uses both main deck and lower hold for containers. Lower deck is expected to remain the largest deck type for global air cargo container market during the forecast period due to their use by both passenger and cargo aircraft. Buy this report @ https://www.wiseguyreports.com/checkout?currency=one_user-USD&report_id=636806 Composite materials based air cargo containers are likely to experience the fastest growth during the forecast period. Increasing demand of lightweight containers for reducing operational cost by increasing fuel efficiency is the major driver of the segment. High durability and increased life of containers are the other major drivers of the segment. Composites based containers are about 20% to 40% lighter than that of aluminum based similar sized containers. Wide body aircraft is expected to remain the largest aircraft type for the global air cargo containers market during the forecast period. High number of containers per aircraft, increasing deliveries of wide body aircraft, and increasing demand of wide body aircraft by cargo airlines are some of the major growth drivers of the segment. Wide body aircraft is expected to experience the fastest growth for the same period. The supply chain of this market comprises of raw material suppliers, panel manufacturers, container manufacturers, distributors, ULD management companies, and airline companies. The key air cargo container manufacturers are Zodiac Aerospace, Cargo Composites, Nordisk Aviation, VRR Aviation, and Satco Inc. Lightweight containers, partnership with ULD management companies, and regional expansion are the key strategies adopted by the key players to gain competitive edge in the market.

X Emirates high-flyer worries about Dublin Airport’s capacity constraints As airline increases Dublin-Dubai capacity, Enda Corneille says third terminal inevitable Fri, Nov 4, 2016, 06:54 Barry O'Halloran Enda Corneille, country manager for Emirates in Ireland, says Dublin Airport needs “a bit of work” before A380s can land there.         Enda Corneille joined Emirates as the airline’s Irish country manager in August 2014, at a pivotal point in its history in this State – shortly before it increased its flights on the Dublin to Dubai route from once a day to twice a day. The move was well-flagged and made sense for the Gulf carrier, as its business here had grown far quicker than expected. It was a “bit of a baptism of fire”, Corneille recalls. But he need not have worried. Two years later, Emirates is filling 78 per cent of the 22,000 seats a month that its aircraft carry on the route. “We are currently tracking 16 per cent ahead of last year,” he notes. “In fact, as we go into 2017, we are going to increase our capacity further. “The aircraft we are operating have 360 seats. They are Boeing 777s, so we are going to upgrade one of those to a 428-seater. We still see there’s growth in the market.” The increase in capacity will come slightly ahead of next year, as the first 428-seater aircraft will take off from Dublin on December 28th and remain on the route right through 2017. Cargo market Alongside the passengers, Emirates has a strong cargo business. The holds of its aircraft are consistently 90 per cent full – with anything from live animals to pharmaceuticals, food, and even baby formula, which is ultimately destined for China. “The belly of the aircraft is very big, so it gives us the chance to sell actively into the cargo market,” Corneille says. While filling 78 per cent of capacity may seem high, local carriers regularly fill a far greater proportion of their planes. Aer Lingus consistently has load factors well above 80 per cent, while Ryanair’s top 90 per cent. Corneille points out that these airlines generate some profits from ancillary revenues – selling food, drinks or charging for extra bags. ADVERTISEMENT As a consequence, they have to focus on selling more seats. That does not mean that Emirates’ craft are never full. The airline regularly sells over 90 per cent of its seats during peak times. Corneille says its focus is to maintain a balanced business throughout the year. Middle Eastern hub About 80 per cent of its passengers travel – or fly in from – beyond Dubai, connecting at the Middle Eastern hub, now the world’s busiest airport, to and from other destinations on the Emirates network. Australia is one of the obvious ones, particularly given that so many Irish people emigrated there during the recession. That increased demand, as they and their families travelled between the two countries. However, that is only one element of its business. Passengers also travel to airports such as Trivandrum and Cochin in India, Guangzhou in China and Nigeria. “These are big markets for migrant workers living in Ireland, ” he points out. “Then you have people holidaying in the Indian Ocean, the Maldives, Seychelles, Mauritius. “And you have companies doing business in China and Australia, so you’ve got a very wide mix. When you are talking about an operation of that scale, 70 per cent to 80 per cent is where you want to be. “At Christmas time, at Easter, you can sell 97 per cent of your seats – but those are busy times and you would expect that to be the case.” Part of the thinking behind the move to a twice-daily operation was to open up more destinations and carve a bigger slice of the market to and from Ireland. Emirates flights are timed to allow travellers connect to onward flights. For this to work, Corneille explains that it has to be daily. Next month’s further increase in capacity indicates that it is working. And Corneille believes the expansion may not stop there. Natural progression “If you spool forward, the natural progression for us in the Irish market is to bring in the Airbus A380,” he says. “Emirates have 84 A380s and we have 58 coming in the next number of years. If Ireland continues on this growth track, it would be no surprise that we would see it landing in Dublin. To put it in scale, you are talking about 615 seats every flight.” Dublin Airport has “a bit of work to be done” before A380s can land there, he cautions. In that respect, Corneille agrees that its plans for a second runway are good news for both his operation and other airlines, though he sees signs that the airport’s infrastructure is showing the strain of continued growth. Passenger numbers this year are on track to break the 25 million record set in 2015. “I think the growth of activity at Dublin Airport has maybe taken people by surprise,” Corneille says. “What I would say about the pressure there is that I do not believe that the consumer experience is impaired significantly. But if you go forward two or three years, and if the airport keeps growing, it will make it very uncomfortable.” If the crowds seen in the early mornings in terminal two – where Emirates’ aircraft take off and land – were to grow significantly, he argues it would be difficult for check-in and security staff to handle. Consequently, he believes that a third terminal is a natural consequence of a second runway. Growing bottlenecks Corneille is not the only one who has noticed the growing bottlenecks in Dublin Airport. Aer Lingus chief executive Stephen Kavanagh warned of their possible impact on its growing transatlantic business earlier this year. ADVERTISEMENT The airport’s manager, State-company Dublin Airport Authority (DAA), shares Aer Lingus’s view that Dublin is ideally positioned to develop as a transatlantic hub, and has been working on responding to the airline’s concerns. Does Corneille believe that this has brought about a shift in DAA’s priorities away from businesses such as his, which are flying in the opposite direction? The short answer is “no”, but he couches his response with the warning that US air traffic can drop sharply in some circumstances. “It is prone to shocks, far more so than others,” he says. “If I look at our business in Emirates, no one market, in terms of region, delivers more than 30 per cent of our revenue, so we are not dependent on UAE, or Australia or America; it’s fairly even. “I know by experience, sadly, that it does not take much for something to happen for US customers to switch off travelling to Europe. ” Part of the experience to which he refers is working on the turnaround of Aer Lingus – then led by fellow Dubliner Willie Walsh, who is now chief executive of that airline’s parent IAG – when its transatlantic business suffered along, with that of the whole industry, following the 9/11 attacks on the World Trade Center in New York in 2001. Corneille joined Aer Lingus as a clerk straight from school in the 1980s and worked his way up through the organisation, which was wholly State-owned in those days. He spent a part of this time abroad, working in such places as Sweden, the Netherlands and the UK. Between 2010 and 2012, he fulfilled a long-term ambition to do an MBA, focused on aviation, and then did a stint teaching with industry body, the International Air Transport Association (IATA). After two years and yet more travelling, he took up his current job. Currency volatility For the moment at least, Corneille says it appears that the traditional link between growth and air travel is broken. Airlines tended to benefit as countries got richer and suffered in downturns. However, in Europe, that does not appear to be the case: economies are flat-lining but air travel is still growing. Nevertheless, he warns that there are challenges ahead. Currency volatility is one of them. “In our business, a 4 or 5 per cent margin is stellar,” he says. “Last year, Emirates did 8.4 [per cent], Ryanair is in the teens, but so many airlines are below the 4 or 5 per cent. It does not take much to tip them below the line. “The dollar is very strong at the moment. Airlines pay all their big bills in dollars. If you are not a US-originating carrier or you don’t do a lot of business in the US, you have to buy your currency – so just a few percentage points on the currency could wipe out a bottom line.” Dollar exchange rates and oil prices are two sides of the same coin in aviation. Oil began tumbling from above the $100-a-barrel mark shortly after Corneille joined Emirates. Fuel has gone from 35 per cent of its cost, at that time, to 26 per cent now. But most in the industry believe prices will begin to rise again in about a year. Corneille argues that airlines will have to able to make money at around $75 to $80-a-barrel if they are going to survive. “Low fuel risks covering a myriad of sins,” he says. “It’s all about the fundamentals of your business. If you can only be profitable at a fuel price of $47, you are in real trouble when it goes to $50 or $55. If and when it gets to $75, if that was a new normal, I think you are going to see casualties out there.” ADVERTISEMENT Brexit Brexit is one of the culprits for recent currency volatility as the vote weakened both sterling and the euro against the dollar. The UK accounts for about 16 per cent of Emirates’ capacity. Its departure from the EU would also mean that Europe’s biggest airport, Heathrow, would find itself outside the union. “The UK is a market in which we have invested heavily,” he says. “So far, we haven’t seen any major shifts in demand. In the Irish context, one of the interesting achievements we’ve had here has been attracting customers from Northern Ireland to fly on our services from Dublin. “That’s something for which we have worked very hard. Were a hard border to be put in between Northern Ireland and the Republic, that certainly would impact our business. But at the moment it’s anybody’s guess where that’s going to end up.” On the whole, Corneille is optimistic that Brexit will not ultimately dampen consumers’ appetite for air travel. “The people leaving school now have never known a world without low-cost airlines,” he says. “People will still want to travel, airlines will still be needed to fulfil that demand.” Enda Corneille’s CV Name: Enda Corneille Age: 51 Family: married, three children Position: Emirates Air, country manager Ireland Why is he in the news? The airline is planning to boost capacity in Ireland and may ultimately use 600-seat Airbus A380s to serve its Dublin-Dubai route. Career: Joined Aer Lingus after leaving school and worked his way up through the organisation, spending a period abroad and returning to Ireland when the airline faced a crisis in the early years of this century. Did an MBA in 2012 and spent a period teaching with the International Air Transport Association before joining Emirates in 2014. Something you might expect: He was accepted into Trinity College Dublin to do a PhD within aviation, just before he joined Emirates. Something you might not expect: He once played guitar and drums in a rock band in Lapland.       Topics: Enda Cornellie Post Stephen Kavanagh Willie Walsh Aer Lingus Eu International Air Transport Association Boeing DAA Emirates Emirates Air Ryanair Dubai Dublin(IE) Europe Ireland Subscribe.   More from The Irish Times Technology Snapchat has secretly filed for flotation, sources claim Personal Finance The bond rout and Irish pension savers: what you need to be aware of Golf Rory McIlroy focusing on Major improvement in 2017 Ireland The top five spots in Dublin to go for a walk with the kids Sponsored World-first tech restores mains electricity to Aran Islands Newbridge Silverware builds ambitious plan for US market My Jaguar F-Pace: ‘I was completely blown away’ Ten things to consider when buying a new sofa ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT Commenting on The Irish Times has changed.

Comments Computerworld | Nov 3, 2016 10:13 PM PT Like this article? thumbsup 0 thumbsdown RELATED TOPICS Security Cloud Computing Comments Only a few months ago the news broke that Vista Equity Partners had acquired identity management vendor Ping Identity for around $600 million. The private equity buyout is one which, in these IPO-constrained times, has seen increasing interest. With the sale, eyes turned toward Ping to see how it would deliver the growth and quick wins that its new overlords would, no doubt, demand. Ping had already seen good traction -- it claims half of the Fortune 100 as customers and has such marques as Boeing, Cisco, Disney, GE, Kraft Foods, TIAA and Walgreens on its books. But private equity wants more, and so the pressure was on Ping to deliver. We didn't have to wait long with the news that Ping was acquiring UnboundID and integrating the access management vendor's tools into its own platform. Now the fruits of that integration are being harvested with the announcement of new platform capabilities directly resulting from the UnboundID integration. And finding good solutions to the uniquely modern challenges of identity and access management isn't easy. Forrester recently pointed out the tension between two contrary aims, saying, "Security and risk pros often struggle to find the right balance between a seamless customer experience and good security. The unique requirements of customer identity, especially scale, performance, usability and support for seamless multichannel interactions, have necessitated the development of CIAM as its own market segment with competitive offerings distinct from traditional solutions for employee IAM." CIAM (consumer identity access management) is a key recognition of the fact that organizations are becoming more porous and that organizations need to think not only of employees but also of consumers within the broader identity management context. CIAM, the notion of running consumer identity and access management from the cloud, is a key strategy for ensuring these tensions are best balanced. Running from the cloud is a key way to ensure the lightest possible touch, but in a context-appropriate way. Essentially, CIAM enables identity vendors and end-user organizations alike to adopt identity platforms that "learn" over time. "Customer identity and access management has a different set of challenges than the more traditional IAM market, which was built for employee access management," said Andre Durand, CEO and founder, Ping Identity. In terms of functionality, the new Ping platform offers single sign-on, multifactor authentication, social login and adaptive authentication capabilities. Specific product highlights include: Ping Directory & Data Server securely stores and manages customer identities and unified customer profiles that are crucial to driving multichannel engagement and improved customer experience. Designed to store rich profile data, the Ping Directory & Data Server supports structured and unstructured data, modern protocols, includes developer-friendly REST APIs, and dramatically lowers total cost of ownership (TCO) relative to legacy directory server products. Ping Data Sync Server keeps identity and profile data synchronized across diverse data sources, both on-premises and in the cloud, to ensure identity data and customer profiles are up to date in real-time for consistent multichannel engagement. The product is used to migrate identity data off costly legacy directory server products so they can be retired, and also to sync production identity data to testing and staging environments while protecting personally identifiable information (PII) and passwords. Ping Data Governance Server provides customers convenience and enhances loyalty and trust by giving them the freedom to self-manage their profiles, preferences and privacy choices. The Ping Data Governance Server manages and governs access to sensitive customer data for apps, employees and partners with centralized policy controls and secure REST APIs, as well as features for delegated account administration. MyPOV Identity management is going to be an increasingly complex area which spans internal-employee, external-contractor and customer/consumer access alike. This release is a good step in that direction and should provide some more growth for those voracious private equity demands. This article is published as part of the IDG Contributor Network.

There was no danger of mid-air collision of two passenger planes on Thursday evening, a spokesman for the Russian Federal Air Transport Agency (Rosaviatsia) told Tass in comments on media reports that said referring to emergency services that two Boeing passenger planes flew dangerously close to each other over the Russian city of Ivanovo. Russia’s State Air Traffic Management Corporation confirmed this information to Tass, explaining that the incident came because of an unsanctioned descent of a Turkish Pegasus Airlines’s plane in mid-air between Podolsk and Klimovsk (located 55 kilometers south of Moscow and eight kilometers south of Podolsk). "There was no danger of the two planes’ colliding," Sergei Izvolsky said, adding that reports saying this could have led to an accident were not true. An official representative of Russia’s State Air Traffic Management Corporation, Nikolai Ivashov, told Tass that the airborne proximity warning indicator went off on board the passenger airliner of Pegasus Airlines. The incident involved the Pegasus Airlines’ plane flying from Istanbul to Moscow’s Domodedovo airport and a Russian Utair airline’s plane on its way from Moscow’s Vnukovo airport to Chechen capital Grozny. The warning system went off as the Turkish plane began an unsanctioned descent from the altitude of 3,650 meters to 3,350 meters, while an Utair plane was ascending to an altitude of 3,350 meters, Ivashov said. Ivashov said the planes passed each other successfully due to prompt actions of air traffic controllers. There was no danger of mid-air collision, and the incident is looked into, he added. {{item.group_date}} {{item.suffix?", "+item.suffix:""}} Show more Share Top News November 15, 20:51 Putin dismisses Ulyukayev as economy minister November 15, 20:51 November 15, 17:32 Investigation into Russian economy minister bribery case underway November 15, 17:32 November 15, 19:18 Russian premier says economy minister's detention is beyond his understanding November 15, 19:18 November 15, 17:48 Analyst says Trump won’t cancel Iranian nuclear deal but may renew sanctions November 15, 17:48 In other media Реклама Photo 14 March to mark anniversary of legendary 1941 parade begins in Moscow 10 Russia's most remarkable monuments 15 Photos of the week: fire in a giant migrant camp, Trump's flag hug and a 'river of sheep' Infographics Russia's gas pipelines to Europe by 2018 Russia’s state defense order in 2015 Chinese Lunar Exploration Program Russia’s Angara A5 heavy-load space carrier rocket Most read Now Today This week 1 Russian Defense Ministry slams US rhetoric on Russia’s actions in Syria 2 Russian forces launch large-scale operation against terrorists in Syria 3 Russian premier says economy minister's detention is beyond his understanding 4 First Russian to land on Moon in 2031 — space corporation 5 Putin dismisses Ulyukayev as economy minister 6 Sanctions against Russia to remain, but may be eased - ex-minister 7 Three layers of Russian air defense at Hmeymim air base in Syria 1 Russian forces launch large-scale operation against terrorists in Syria 2 Putin sets task to ensure reliable protection of Russian forces in Syria 3 Putin to start meetings with Defense Ministry, military-industrial enterprises 4 MIG-29 fighter jet crashes into Mediterranean off Syrian coast 5 Russian economy minister detained over alleged $2 mln bribe linked to Bashneft deal 6 Ulyukayev detained on suspicion of receiving $2 mln for clearing Rosneft-Bashneft deal 7 Russian warship wipes out terrorists with Kalibr missiles in Syria 1 Dutch sub tried to approach Russian aircraft carrier in Mediterranean — defense ministry 2 Russian forces launch large-scale operation against terrorists in Syria 3 Trump elected president of the United States — live coverage 4 MIG-29 fighter jet crashes into Mediterranean off Syrian coast 5 Putin congratulates Donald Trump on winning US presidential election 6 Russia-US discord will leave with Obama administration: lawmakers' reaction to Trump's win 7 US election results in animated graphics TOP STORIES US presidential election 2016 Conflict in Syria Russia's defense industry Oil & Gas Industry Space programs Реклама News World Russian Politics & Diplomacy Business & Economy Military & Defense Science & Space Society & Culture Sport Press Review Sections Tags Media Press Releases Infographics About us TASS TODAY AGENCY NEWS TASS HISTORY MANAGEMENT CONTACTS Services TASS-PHOTO TASS-ONLINE TASS Beta-version.

The manufacturer has identified a “limited number” of parts closely related to one used by American that had a "material anomaly," according to the letter sent on Friday. All but one of the parts are now out of service, GE said in the letter. It added that it was working with the single airline with an aircraft still equipped with the part to ensure its removal from service. GE did not name the airline. A company spokesman, Rick Kennedy, confirmed that GE had sent the letter and said it was still in the early stage of an "intense investigation." On Oct. 28, American Airlines Flight 383 from Chicago to Miami aborted takeoff following an "uncontained" engine failure, a rare event in which components spew from an engine and can tear through the aircraft cabin or rupture fuel tanks in the wings. The airline was flying a Boeing Co 767 aircraft with CF6-80C2 engines made by GE. In this instance, the failure caused a fuel leak that resulted in a fire, though no one aboard was seriously injured. An American Airlines spokesman said none of the company's aircraft in operation had the additional parts that GE referred to in the letter. The spokesman added that American was turning over a part from an engine not in operation to the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) for further examination. U.S. investigators have yet to assign blame for last week's incident. However, they said on Friday that a so-called stage 2 disk in the engine showed what appeared to be cracking. The disk's corrupted material likely indicated a manufacturing defect, either by the parts or metal maker, said Jim Hall, a former NTSB chairman. In its letter, GE stressed the reliability of its CF6 engines which it said had flown more than 400 million hours since the 1970s. GE will update engine operators if action is later required, the letter said. Bloomberg earlier reported news of the letter from GE.

The manufacturer has identified a "limited number" of parts closely related to one used by American that had a "material anomaly," according to the letter sent on Friday. All but one of the parts are now out of service, GE said in the letter. It added that it was working with the single airline with an aircraft still equipped with the part to ensure its removal from service. GE did not name the airline and a company spokesman did not immediately comment. On Oct. 28, American Airlines Flight 383 from Chicago to Miami aborted takeoff following an "uncontained" engine failure, a rare event in which components spew from an engine and can tear through the aircraft cabin or rupture fuel tanks in the wings. The airline was flying a Boeing Co 767 aircraft with CF6-80C2 engines made by GE. In this instance, the failure caused a fuel leak that resulted in a fire, though no one aboard was seriously injured. An American Airlines spokesman said none of the company's aircraft in operation had the additional parts that GE referred to in the letter. The spokesman added that American was turning over a part from an engine not in operation to the U.S. National Transportation Saftey Board (NTSB) for further examination. U.S. investigators have yet to assign blame for last week's incident. However, they said on Friday that a so-called stage 2 disk in the engine showed what appeared to be cracking. The disk's corrupted material likely indicated a manufacturing defect, either by the parts or metal maker, said Jim Hall, a former NTSB chairman. In its letter, GE stressed the reliability of its CF6 engines which it said had flown more than 400 million hours since the 1970s. GE will update engine operators if action is later required, the letter said. Bloomberg earlier reported news of the letter from GE.

Inslee Signs Supplemental Operating Budget, Vetoes Several Provisions News The Green Sheet– March 7, 2016 Caroline Halter and WSW Staff | Washington State Wire Features March 7, 2016 Alas, the last week of the 2016 Legislative Regular Session is finally here. Although it was short, it wasn’t exactly sweet. Tensions ran high this year, between the ongoing investigation of the Department of Corrections by the Senate, the surprise firing of now former-Secretary of Transportation, Lynn Peterson (also by the Senate) and the transgender restroom fiasco. We also saw the introduction of two controversial Initiatives–a carbon tax and the minimum wage. The Carbon Tax Initiative, I-732, has generated surprising opposition, not just from the business community but even the State Democratic Party and other major environmental groups.  Meanwhile,the Washington Business Alliance has quietly been working on an alternative, a 732B, which if passed would also appear on the ballot in November.  There is growing support for this draft but time seems to be running out.  In a meeting last week at the Association of Washington Business with key industry leads, even the Governor’s staff were receptive to working on an alternative. The timing on the Governor’s decision to temporarily pull his Clean Air Rule is seen by many as an attempt to clear the way for an I-732B.  While some would prefer to take the path of least resistance and let I-732 fail at the ballot, others urge action, saying that if they don’t act now they’ll end up with a much more onerous carbon tax or cap and trade solution. On Saturday the campaign for at $13.50 statewide minimum wage kicked off. In anticipation, both Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders endorsed the initiative via Twitter. Adding to the momentum, Oregon Governor Kate Brown signed a new minimum wage into law last week, guaranteeing $14.75 for Portland and $13.50 for the rest of the state. In the midst of two liberal initiatives, it’s easy to forget that conservatives groups have this tool at their disposal as well. Let’s not forget that the infamous Tim Eyman initiative, which would have made it more difficult to raise taxes in Washington State. It was struck down by the state’s Supreme Court, spurring identical resolutions from Senate Republicans, none of which passed. A group called Just Want Privacy filed an initiative that would do the same thing that a few Republican lawmakers attempted to do during the session: repeal a Human Rights Commission Ruling regarding gender identity and choice of restroom and/or locker room facility. Initiatives aside, this week is about passing a budget…maybe. The supplemental budgets passed by each house differ by more than $400 million in overall spending. In an interview with Austin Jenkins Representative Hans Dunshee, D-Snohomish, said “For us it might be better to just stay with the existing budget and leave.” It may be easy for Dunshee to walk away empty-handed, seeing as he’ll be joining the Snohomish County Council rather than running for reelection. But, his fellow Democrats won’t get off the hook so easily. There is pressure for them to get funding for things like homelessness and raise teacher salaries. House Democrats proposed tapping the rainy day fund. They also want to increase revenue by closing a series of tax loopholes. What do Republicans want? A modest increase in spending that includes money for charter schools, and to send a message to the Supreme Court by refusing to pay the fine imposed at the end of last session. What do both sides want? To go home on time. Lawmakers are still hungover from last session, which lasted a whopping 176 days, making it the longest in our state’s history.  Lawmakers have penciled a few laws this session, but they still have some key issues to work through. Will the Voting Rights Act pass? Charter schools? Ban on Flame Retardants? Boeing tax exemptions? The law enforcement pension merger? The preservation tax exemption for affordable housing? What about the police body camera bill?Tune in this week to see what happens. Quotes: Here’s Senator Bruce Dammeier, R-Puyallup, responding to Representative Dunshee’s comments (see above) about the budget: “The House budget, besides spending $500 million more, is kind of does it have that fiscal discipline going out four years. And that’s a big philosophical difference.” State Auditor Troy Kelley’s criminal-defense lawyer said this at a pretrial hearing last Friday: “This case started as a political attack, and once the FBI got it, it became a high-profile political corruption case.” “Policy without money is not policy,” said Representative Dunshee during a House Appropriations Committee hearing on February 29th. “We have finally come to a bill that addresses almost every single concern we have heard except for one — that is the ability to make the bill actually mean something. Some Republicans continue to tell us they are worried about the right to use the courts to determine whether or not the solutions that are agreed upon actually address polarized voting and meet the criteria of the federal Voting Rights Act.” That was Senator Pramila Jayapa, D-Seattle, speaking on the tenuous legislation. Calendar: This week will be chock-full of floor debate, back door negotiations and interim planning.

Sandeep Unnithan  Follow @SandeepUnnithan   sandy@intoday.com November 2, 2016 | UPDATED 13:06 IST A +A - An Embraer ERJ-145 with the DRDO developed AEW&C radar at Aero India 2015 in Bangalore. In the murky world of arms deals which thrives on stealth and shady wire transfers, the document filed before a US court probably came as a blast of bright, blinding sunshine. In a 59-page deferred prosecution agreement in the US district court in Florida on October 24, Brazilian aircraft manufacturer Embraer confessed it was guilty of paying bribes to bag aircraft contracts across the world. The agreement, a copy of which is with India Today, painstakingly details how Embraer paid $5.76 million in 2009 to an Indian arms agent identified in the document only as 'Agent D'. The bribes were to swing a $200 million deal for the sale of three Embraer ERJ-145 jets. These twin-engined aircraft were to be customised for India to fit an indigenous Airborne Early Warning and Control (AEW&C) radar. The path to the doorstep of the US district court in Florida was a long one. It began in 2010 when US authorities suspected irregularities in the sale of aircraft by Embraer to the Dominican Republic. The allegations gathered steam in 2013 when the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) first detailed kickbacks paid by the Sao Paulo-based aircraft manufacturer to bag contracts in several countries including India. The October 24 agreement essentially means that Embraer is free to carry on its business after paying the hefty $205 million in fines to US authorities. An October 24 statement released by the Sao Paulo-based aircraft conglomerate, expressed 'deep regrets' for its conduct, acknowledged responsibility for the conduct of its employees and agents according to the facts ascertained in the investigation. Click here to Enlarge The fraud section of the US department of justice moved against the Brazilian airplane maker in 2013. US laws like the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, 1977, which prohibits bribery of foreign nationals apply to US-registered companies like Embraer which trade shares on the New York Stock Exchange. The ripples of the global bribery scandal, from which Embraer made an $83 million profit, have already begun to be felt in India. The CBI registered a preliminary inquiry in September this year when a Brazilian newspaper first reported the bribery investigations. The CBI now believes Agent D is Delhi-based defence consultant Vipin Khanna, 87. On October 18, the agency registered a case against the octogenarian defence agent for receiving bribes in the aircraft purchase. This means the Union ministry of defence could place further dealings with the Brazilian jet maker on hold unless the ministry notifies a new debarment policy that lays the ground rules for dealing with bribe-giving defence firms (see box: Blacklist Policy Paralysis). "The CBI investigation will proceed according to Indian laws on corruption, kickbacks etc. subject to appropriate evidence," a defence ministry spokesperson said. BLACKLIST POLICY PARALYSIS For over two years now, the NDA government has toyed with a debarment policy which would punish bribe-giving defence companies without hurting defence preparedness. The effects of blacklists on Bofors and HDW after the bribery scandal of the mid-1980s have lethally impacted India's defence preparedness for nearly three decades. Over a dozen defence suppliers have been blacklisted in the past decade. Finance minister Arun Jaitley, who held the defence portfolio earlier, summed it up in August 2014. Blacklisting, he said, "upholds consideration of probity but narrows our buying options...which can affect our security preparedness". In 2014, the MoD initiated a nuanced suspension and debarment policy which, rather than an outright ban, looked at a graded response to allegations (see box: Three-Stage Debarment Policy). A blacklist was the last resort, only after allegations of bribery are established by the CBI. Even so, the MoD and Service HQ retained the right to deal with the tainted firm in the name of national security. A draft of the policy has been pending with defence minister Manohar Parrikar for close to a year now. The MoD is believed to have scrapped a proposal to legalise defence agents in arms sales. The delay in approving the debarment policy has resulted in anxiety within the forces. The policy was supposed to be released with the Defence Procurement Policy (DPP) in March this year, but held back. In fact, the DPP mentions it at least a dozen times. Blacklists continue to impact the military machine that already imports nearly 70 per cent of its defence requirements. They shrink an already limited space of equipment suppliers. The navy's new Scorpene class submarines, for instance, do not have torpedoes because the torpedo maker belongs to the Leonardo-Finmeccanica firm, one of whose subsidiaries is accused in the 2010 VVIP helicopter purchase scandal. Major democratic military powers like the US have elaborate suspension and debarment procedures, which balance considerations of probity and integrity with national security. In the deferred prosecution agreement, authorities included a simple formula for assessing Embraer's guilt. The calculations clinically weigh various factors- the complicity of senior officials and the company's contrition-before arriving at the figure of 205 million dollars. "India has not been able to strike such a balance due to inappropriate policies," says Vivek Rae, former DG (acquisitions) in the defence ministry. "The Indian political and bureaucratic establishment likes to occupy the moral high ground at the slightest whiff of corruption, overlooking the fact it might be compromising national security. There are various options for penalising rogue companies. Blacklisting need not be the default option." Defence ministry sources say a Defence Acquisition Committee meeting, slated for November 7, will take a final call on the debarment policy. But as with several recent meetings, it remains to be seen if the policy actually gets approved.   THE SLEAZE TRAIL Embraer first touched down in India in 2004 when the Indian Air Force's Palam-based communications squadron bought three ECJ 135 business jets (a fourth jet was purchased by the home ministry for the Border Security Force). The aircraft, meant for use by the defence minister and the service chiefs, quickly set new standards in comfort. One UPA-era defence minister, who moved out to another ministry, insisted on still being able to use the business jet. By 2015, the Brazilian firm was the world's third largest airplane maker after Boeing and Airbus. The company delivered 215 jets last year, with a year-on-year growth of 6.3 per cent and an order backlog of $22.5 billion. A vein of corruption however ran through some of the deals for military aircraft as the documents filed before the US court show. Sometime in January 2005, soon after its maiden foray into India, Embraer signed an agency agreement with a shell company domiciled in the UK and affiliated with Agent D. Under the agency agreement, Embraer agreed to pay the shell company 9 per cent of the value of any defence contract. According to the deferred prosecution agreement, "Embraer believed that Agent D could help ensure that any contract would be awarded on single-source rather than competitive basis". Embraer, of course, knew the agreement with the agent was illegal under Indian law and thus took steps to conceal its existence. The sole fully-executed version of the agreement was placed in a safe deposit box in London. It could be opened only when both an Embraer employee and Agent D or his associate were present. This also explains the even greater lengths the firm was to go to mask the eventual bribes to Agent D. The money trail passed through Switzerland and was routed through a shell company in Singapore which paid the Indian agents. India's defence ministry bans middlemen and the payment of commissions in defence deals. Companies have to sign a pre-tender integrity pact where they expressly state they have not paid money to manipulate the contract. On February 8, 2005, Embraer announced that it had signed an MoU with the Defence Research & Development Organisation (DRDO) to supply new early warning aircraft for the IAF. These had the same engines and airframe as the jets sold to the IAF's VVIP squadron. The MoU with the DRDO, Embraer believed, could result in securing a contract for an initial sale of three ERJ-145 aircraft. The DRDO, at the time, was on a global hunt for long-range business jets on which it could mount an indigenously developed airborne radar-the Airborne Early Warning and Control System (AEW&C). The AEW&C radar, mounted on the aircraft fuselage, could monitor enemy aircraft and cruise missiles up to 250 km. Part of a Rs 2,500 crore DRDO programme, the contract was a lucrative one. IAF staff requirements called for 12 such aircraft to patrol its air frontiers with Pakistan and China. "AEW&C aircraft are the key to offensive air operations," says Air Marshal P.S. Ahluwalia (retired), former C-in-C, Western Air Command. "They are eyes in the sky which can see anything airborne over 200 km across the western and eastern borders. This means, I don't have to put all my fighters up in the air. It increases our choices and we don't need to waste resources on air defence operations." Between 2005 and 2006, Delhi-based NRI Vipin Khanna and his sons Arvind and Aditya were hitting the news with unnerving frequency. And for all the wrong reasons. First, it was the 2005 Volcker report which found that India's then external affairs minister Natwar Singh used his position to lobby Iraqi ministers in the 'oil-for-food' scandal. Singh had lobbied Iraqi officials to do business with companies linked with his son Jagat Singh and a relative, Aditya Khanna, the son of Vipin Khanna. An FIR filed by the CBI in October 2006 found Arvind Khanna, then a Congress party MLA, to be the recipient of remittances from Israeli Aircraft Industries (IAI) for the sale in 2000 of Barak-1 missiles to India. Others charged in the Rs 1,150 crore deal included former defence minister George Fernandes and arms agent Suresh Nanda (the CBI closed the case in 2013 for lack of evidence). Meanwhile, on July 3, 2008, Embraer hit pay dirt. The IAF agreed to purchase three aircraft from Embraer for approximately $208 million. The very next day, on July 4, 2008, the US documents say, Agent D contacted Embraer and demanded he be paid the agreed-upon commission. The dispute over the commission continued for some months. Sometime in early 2009, an Embraer executive met with lawyers representing Agent D and agreed to pay $5.76 million to settle the claim. To conceal the payment, Embraer created a false agency agreement, a common ruse among recent defence kickbacks. On November 21, 2009, Embraer, through a wholly-owned subsidiary, ECC Investment Switzerland AG, executed an agency agreement with a shell company domiciled in Singapore. This shell company was affiliated with Agent D for its purported services as an agent in a sale made to another country. (The US court document does not specify the country or the sale). The agreement was executed on the same day. The Singaporean shell company delivered three invoices to ECC, each for $1.92 million. These invoices had nothing to do with the aircraft sale to the IAF. Embraer, through ECC Investment Switzerland, remitted three payments to the shell company shortly thereafter. Embraer's books and records did not reflect that this transaction was related to its agreement with Agent D. All three aircraft were delivered to the DRDO by 2011. The agency hopes to complete the programme by next year and hand the aircraft over to the IAF. Highly-placed sources in Delhi say that Vipin Khanna was nothing more than a front for the deal. The deal, they say, was most likely executed by his London-based son, Aditya. The Khanna family did not respond to e-mails and calls for comment. The Embraer scandal is only the newest among a clutch of UPA-era defence scandals to tumble out of the closet. On October 31, the BBC and The Guardian detailed how their investigation had found that UK-based aircraft engine firm Rolls Royce had made secret payments of 10 million pounds to firms linked to UK-based arms agent Sudhir Choudhrie. The payments were linked to the sales of the Hawk trainer aircraft purchased by India from the UK-based BAE systems in two tranches-66 jets in 2004 and 57 jets in 2010. On October 17, the Delhi police registered a case under the Official Secrets Act against defence consultant Sanjay Bhandari for possessing classified MoD documents. Bhandari's name has been linked to other defence deals too signed during the UPA era. The CBI is already investigating alleged bribery in the 2010 purchase of 12 VVIP helicopters from a British subsidiary of Italian defence conglomerate Leonardo-Finmeccanica. Over the next few days, CBI officials are likely to fan out across the world, from the United States where the case was registered, to Embraer's headquarters in Sao Paulo. CBI investigators will issue Letters Rogatory requesting foreign courts to cooperate with their investigation as they follow the money trail from New York to London, Switzerland and Singapore. More important, CBI sleuths will have to establish the last mile connect in the bribe chain: that Embraer's payoffs to the Indian middleman were in turn used to bribe officials in India. It is an arduous international trail, one familiar to investigators in arms bribery scandals from Bofors in the 1980s to the Barak missile scam in 2006. Very little of promise comes out even after decades of investigation. "The Embraer bribery case too will meet a similar fate," predicts former CBI director Joginder Singh. "How will the CBI get the evidence? The law does not recognise depositions made before Indian policemen and foreign nationals have no incentive to come and depose before an Indian court." Ajay Agnihotri, former chief commissioner, customs and central excise, blames the CBI's lack of specialists as the root cause of their inability to book cases in arms deals. "The CBI is manned by IPS officers who're clueless about banking and finance matters which is what these bribery cases are about." But with the culpability of the company proven and much of the graft trail and agents out in the open, this time the CBI has little recourse but to seek some semblance of successful closure.   Follow the writer on Twitter @SandeepUnnithan     For more news from India Today, follow us on Twitter @indiatoday and on Facebook at facebook.com/IndiaToday For news and videos in Hindi, go to AajTak.in. ताज़ातरीन ख़बरों और वीडियो के लिए आजतक.इन पर आएं.     # Embraer# Embraer deal# India# CBI# DRDO# IAF# Emraer bribery scandal   Recommended Watch Right Now Top Takes NEWS INDIA WORLD PHOTOS CRICKET MOVIES AUTO SPORTS LIFESTYLE TECH EDUCATION BUSINESS SITEMAP Copyright © 2016 Living Media India Limited.

The incident happened on October 25, when the unidentified aircraft, belonging to the Air National Guard, took off from Selfridge Base near Detroit, Michigan, and lost the bombs on its way to Camp Grayling training center, the website Military.com reported. The munitions, including six bombs and a missile, were later found in a wooded area near Luzerne. Nobody was injured, according to the report. Military officials blamed the incident on a mechanical failure. No more details were disclosed in this regard. Lieutenant Colonel Matthew Trumble, director of the Camp Grayling Air Gunnery Range, downplayed the incident, saying such mishaps were “rare.” According to the Michigan Air National Guard, the missile was non-explosive and did not pose any threats.It was not clear if the bombs were operational. The force only said that it was able to locate them by activating a smoke mechanism that allows pilots to track the bombs when they fall. In another accident involving military aircraft, a US Air Force KC-10 Extender air tanker lost its refueling boom during an exercise over the state of Idaho on Tuesday.  A Boeing KC-10 Extender air tanker stretches its boom to refuel an F-22 Raptor fighter jet. The aircraft, which belonged to the 60th Air Mobility Wing based at Travis Air Force Base, California, made an emergency landing after the mishap. Nobody was injured in that incident either. The Extender can carry more than 356,000 pounds [178 tons] of fuel in its six tanks and is capable of delivering fuel at a maximum rate of 1,100 gallons [4163 liters] per minute.         Tweet More by Special Correspondent RELATED NEWS January 27, 2016 Indian fighter jet accidentally drops 5 bombs in Rajasthan July 07, 2015 Iraq jet accidentally bombs Baghdad, killing eight March 03, 2014 US Navy jet crashes during training October 02, 2011, 4:24 pm Yemeni jet mistakenly bombs army post, kills 30 MORE IN INTERNATIONAL November 15, 2016, 8:40 pm Twitter rolls out tool to curb online abuse, bullying November 15, 2016, 8:15 pm Integrate or face populist fury, London mayor warns November 15, 2016, 8:09 pm Hundreds return to Turkish city after eight-month curfew November 15, 2016, 7:57 pm Spike in murders seen after Florida self-defense law: study Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus TODAY'S POPULAR Most Viewed | Most Commented ‘Will represent other country if Pakistan doesn’t give ...

Skip to content Satellite Press Releases Satellite Press Releases and News Aerospace Industry Adoption of SPD-Smart Electronically Dimmable Windows Highlights 2016 NBAA Trade Show ORLANDO, FL–(Marketwired – November 04, 2016) – The trend towards increasing adoption of SPD-Smart electronically dimmable windows (EDWs) for aircraft was evident at this week’s National Business Aviation Association Convention and Exhibition in Orlando, Florida. Aircraft at the show’s static display, mockups on the show floor, and public statements in the media, all point towards the industry’s growing recognition of EDWs as a mature solution for the challenges inherent in controlling light, glare, heat and noise in aircraft cabins. Business aviation and commercial aviation share the goal of improving the passenger experience, and this need has opened new horizons in cabin innovations. One such innovation is SPD EDW systems. Passengers, at the touch of a button, can instantly and precisely control the amount of daylight and glare coming through their window. They continue to enjoy views by tinting their SPD-Smart EDW to control the amount of light to a comfortable level, rather than blocking their view with a shade. SPD EDW systems offer the aerospace industry a potent and unique solution to improving how passengers feel while in flight, by managing the ideal level of daylight in the cabin — as well as offering a cooler, quieter cabin. Textron Beechcraft: King Air 350i, King Air 250, and King Air C90GTx SPD-Smart EDWs, supplied by Research Frontiers licensee InspecTech Aero Service, are standard equipment on all three models of Beechcraft King Airs: King Air 350i, King Air 250, and King Air C90GTx. Two models of King Airs were at this week’s NBAA show. InspecTech is now shipping their “iShade” brand of SPD-Smart EDWs for all three models, and King Airs with the new interiors are now being delivered to customers. Honda Aircraft Company: HondaJet HA-420 SPD-Smart EDWs, supplied by Research Frontiers licensee Vision Systems, are standard equipment on the HondaJet HA-420. A HondaJet demonstrator aircraft was on display at this week’s NBAA show. Vision Systems is now shipping their “Nuance” brand of SPD-Smart EDWs for the HondaJet. Deliveries of the HondaJet to customers began in December of 2015. Dassault Aviation: Falcon 5X SPD-Smart skylights, supplied by Vision Systems, have been selected as standard equipment on the upcoming Dassault Falcon 5X. At this week’s NBAA, a mockup of this aircraft was on display. To offer business aviation’s first skylight, Dassault was faced with a critical need to manage the intense solar light, glare and heat coming into the cabin, and SPD-Smart EDW technology provide the solution. At the NBAA, the media reported that Dassault is confident that the Falcon 5X will be ready for service entry in 2020. Bell Helicopter: 525 and 429 VIP helicopters SPD-Smart EDWs are offered on the Bell Helicopter 429 VIP. Deliveries of this model, with the new interior, was announced by Bell as beginning in March of this year. Passengers control the SPD-Smart EDWs using their own smart devices, which connect to the internal Wi-Fi in the aircraft. SPD-Smart EDWs are also to be offered on the upcoming VIP Model 525. Bell hopes to certify this super-medium rotorcraft in late 2017 or early 2018. At this week’s NBAA, this model, with SPD-Smart EDWs, was launched at the booth of Bell Helicopter. Epic Aircraft: E1000 At this week’s NBAA, a mockup of the Epic E1000 aircraft, with SPD-Smart EDWs, was exhibited. EDWs are standard equipment on the upcoming E1000 — the company now expects that certification is expected in the summer of 2017, with deliveries to begin shortly thereafter. The status of the E1000 was covered by the media at the show: here is an example. The E1000 uses carbon fiber composite material in the airframe, and as a result larger, and a greater number, of passenger windows are possible. These windows presented a light, glare and heat challenge, however SPD-Smart technology provides the elegant solution. Survey on EDWs replacing window shades Further evidence of the industry’s growing recognition of EDWs as a mature solution for the challenges inherent in controlling light, glare, heat and noise in aircraft cabins can be seen in a recent survey. The publication Business Jet Interiors International recently conducted a survey with the question: “Will ‘smart’ glass ever fully replace window shades?” 69% of respondents indicated “Yes.” Lufthansa Technik and Mercedes interior for VIP aircraft At the NBAA this week, an example of the industry’s movement towards EDWs as a solution to a myriad of cabin comfort challenges was Lufthansa Technik and Mercedes presenting the final version of their next-generation interior design for private jets having the size of Airbus and Boeing aircraft. The early design concept, revealed in 2015, has evolved to meet the requirements of airworthiness and certification. A unique use of EDWs are under evaluation for this interior, and the EDW feature has been widely reported in the media: here is an example. Airbus Corporate Jets: Melody interior Another example of the trend towards EDW adoption was seen this week in NBAA show media reports about Airbus Corporate Jet’s “Melody” cabin concept, for future customers of the ACJ320neo family of aircraft. These reports indicate inclusion of EDWs that can control the amount of natural light entering the cabin. Please read this article for an example. Vision Systems at 2016 NBAA Vision Systems showcased an array of SPD-Smart EDWs at NBAA, including its new “Acti-Vision” product which incorporates an interactive transparent display in the EDW, products that combine SPD EDWs with traditional shades, and EDW solutions for the cockpit. The media covered Vision Systems at the show, and here is an example (go to page 10). The comfort and benefits an SPD-Smart EDW system delivers extends to all passengers. Cabin-wide control, operated either automatically with photosensors, or manually by the crew, can result in the optimum level of daylight present throughout the cabin at all times. Benefits include greater daylighting, enhanced views, and a more open feeling resulting in greater perceived space. The management and “harvesting” of healthy daylighting instantly transforms the cabin, and synergistically complements other cabin systems including interior mood lighting systems and entertainment systems, for an unequalled passenger experience. Aircraft windows are a primary path of other environmental elements entering an aircraft cabin through the window opening — heat and noise. These unwanted elements — cabin heat while the aircraft is at the gate or on the taxiway, and cabin noise during the entire flight — are well known to cause passengers discomfort, fatigue, jet lag and other physical and psychological ailments. SPD EDW systems provide remarkable thermal and acoustic insulation, further improving the passenger experience for all. Coupled with the superior daylight management benefits, as an integrated system it is the complete solution for managing the environmental challenges outside conditions inflict on the cabin interior.

Air India Express, which introduced flights between Kolkata and Singapore four days a week, will have Singapore Airlines and Druk Air for company on these two days. Singapore Arilines flies daily, while Druk Air operates three times a week. With the introduction of the AI Express flights, capacity in the sector will increase to 2,870 seats a week — an addition of 756 seats. There are indications though that the capacity may double in a couple of years as Singapore Airlines introduces a larger aircraft and AI Express, as well as Druk Air, hikes frequency. On Friday, AI Express CEO K Shyam Sunder said the airline would explore flights to Bangkok, Hong Kong, Guangzhou, Yangon, Dubai and Kathmandu as well. "We are restarting operations from Kolkata to Singapore and Dhaka but have plans to fly out to more destinations in Southeast Asia once we increase our fleet from 23 planes to 36 in two years. All the additional planes will be taken on lease," he said. Of the current fleet, 17 are owned by the airline and the remaining six, including the one that will operate flights from Kolkata to Singapore and Dhaka, are on lease. On the domestic route, AI Express plans to start a flight between Kolkata and Kochi. Singapore Airlines, which has a daily flight in conjunction with sister carrier Silk Air, will hike its capacity in a couple of years when it replaces the ageing A330 fleet with the new generation Boeing 787 10X, the super-stretched version of the Dreamliner. In the domestic sector, Jet Airways has introduced the A330 on the Kolkata-Delhi route, replacing the Boeing 737-800 to add capacity. Speaking to TOI on the occasion of the airline completing 30 years of operation to Kolkata, India GM David Lim said the carrier hopes to bring in the B787-10X aircraft in a couple of years. The airline has ordered 30 planes from Boeing Co of US in addition to 67 Airbus 350. "Six A350s have arrived and will replace the A330. These will be put into service in Delhi and Mumbai connections next year," he said. The A350 will have a configuration of 42 business, 24 premium economy and 187 economy seats. The configuration of the B 787-10X is yet to be finalized, but it will be able to seat up to 310 passengers. From October to December, and again from April to June, when traffic in the sector increases, the 285-seater Singapore Airlines A330 plies on four days and the 162-seater Silk Air B737-800 plies on three days. The rest of the year, it is three days of Singapore Airlines and four days of Silk Air operations. While fliers who take Druk Air or AI Express will primarily be holidayers to Singapore or traffic from corporates, half of those who take Singapore Airlines or Silk Air fly onward to Australia, New Zealand, Japan or the US west coast.

The free program features safe viewings of the sun during the Cosmic Party and guided tours of the night sky during the Star Party. (Roberto E. Rosales/Journal) .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... ..........Many of the sciences can be intimidating, but Dee Friesen said astronomy is not like that. “Most people sometime in the past have had a pleasant experience with the night sky,” said Friesen, past president of The Albuquerque Astronomical Society. “They don’t equate the night sky with physics or elemental particles. They equate it with a fun camping trip, looking at the Milky Way.” Fun is at the heart of programs TAAS is presenting Saturday afternoon and night at the Open Space Visitor Center, 6500 Coors NW. The Cosmic Carnival from 1 to 5 p.m. will include interactive exhibits by TAAS, Explora! Science Center, the New Mexico Museum of Natural History and Science, the National Museum of Nuclear Science and History, Sandia National Laboratories and others. Advertisement Continue reading “There will be exhibits like ‘Lenses and Telescopes: How Do They Work’ and ‘Black Holes,'” Friesen said. “And we will have telescopes — three, four or five of them — specially designed with proper filters to safely observe the sun.” TAAS members will offer two programs — “The Vastness of the Universe” and “Getting to Know Astronomy” at 2 and 3 p.m. in the center’s media room. And at 1, 2, 3, and 4 p.m., there will be Portable Planetarium Shows in the center’s Kiva Room. Each show is limited to 25 people. Free same day tickets will be available in the lobby. Friesen will be there during the daytime Cosmic Carnival, but he really comes into his own during the nighttime Star Party. He said TAAS will have eight to a dozen telescopes on the visitor center patio so the public can do some star gazing. And then at 7 and 8 p.m. in the Kiva Room, Friesen and Sterling Beeson will present the “TAAS Fabulous Fifty” program. “The purpose of this program is to take people who have never looked at the night sky and provide them with a starting point,” Friesen said. “We have identified 50 bright objects in the night sky. Not all these objects are visible at the same time. It’s seasonal. The stars you see in the summer are not the stars you see in the winter.” Stars people will see tonight, of course, are in the fall sky. Advertisement Continue reading “The bright star Alpheratz in the constellation Andromeda is an example of a star we will show them,” Friesen said. “We will look at the constellations Cassiopeia, Pegasus and Perseus. Planets are low in the southern sky now, so we won’t see them. But we will see the Andromeda Galaxy, known as M31, which is 2.5 million light years away and is the most distant object visible to the human naked eye. The whole idea is that people can see these (bright) objects with their naked eyes.” If the rain and clouds forecast for Saturday actually happen, Friesen said the indoor portions of the daytime and evening program will be presented anyway. Friesen, 72, an Albuquerque resident since 1983, has a master’s degree in physics from the University of Nevada. He has taught at the Air Force Academy and is an adjunct professor at New Mexico Tech in Socorro. A pilot who flew F-4s for the Air Force and Boeing 757s and 767s for American Airlines, he has come closer to the sky than the other side of a telescope. But it was a little telescope with a 4-inch reflector that launched Friesen into the heavens when he was a 14-year-old farm kid in Kansas. “I sold a calf to buy that little telescope,” he said. “I remember that when my parents’ friends came over, I’d take them out into the farmyard so they could look at the sky.” Saturday night at the Open Space Visitor Center, he’ll be doing just what he did on that Kansas farm all those years ago — helping people look at the stars. “For the Fabulous Fifty program, we give a presentation of about 30 minutes and then we go outside and point these things out,” he said. “People don’t have to know anything about astronomy before they come. The only thing they need to be able to do is look up.” Share Tweet LinkedIn Print Subscribe ABQnews Seeker Rio Rancho News Suggested Stories: Star party Saturday on Albuquerque's west side – Feb 26, 2013 Astronomical group hosts star-gazing – Apr 23, 2015 Look up in the sky, it's a Star Party – Nov 5, 2015 Astronomy program is chance to party with the stars – Nov 5, 2016 Advertisement Comments Subscribe to the Journal for only $12.

(KABC) KABC By Leslie Lopez and ABC7.com staff Friday, November 04, 2016 LOS ANGELES (KABC) -- A job event on Friday aims to provide employment opportunities to veterans as part of Mayor Eric Garcetti's 10,000 Strong Veterans Hiring Initiative. The event was scheduled for 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. at Goodwill's Community Enrichment Center at Fletcher Square, located at 3150 N. San Fernando Road in Glassell Park. The hiring event is being held by Goodwill Southern California (GSC), the mayor's Office of Veterans Affairs and the County of Los Angeles Community and Senior Services. According to a press release from GSC, the event aims to help returning service members turn their skills into fulfilling careers by making the hiring process more effective and efficient. "It's a stressful time period. You lose a lot of your support system when you come out into this side of the world, and there was a lot of things I didn't know about. I had never submitted a resume, I never applied for a job, so here, what Goodwill does is it teaches you how to do those things," said John Gutierrez, an employment program manager at Goodwill, and also a veteran. Participating veterans will be pre-screened to match specific employment criteria identified by partnering employers, and in some cases, may be hired on-site, the press release stated. Participating employers include Federal Express, Cheesecake Factory, LA Metro, Boeing, Northrop Grumman, Walmart, Target, Live Nation, local cities, police and fire departments, the Los Angeles Unified School District and more, officials said. Air Force veteran Christina Yeung was one of many who attended the hiring event. "I think the sheriff's department, also the unified school district. I really want to be able to get out there and help someone," Yeung said. In addition to career resources, Clothes The Deal, an organization that provides business attire for veterans, also provided services at the hiring event. "While I was in the military, I was in uniform for the most part. When I left, I probably had about two suits, they were both black, and it was just for formal dinners. A lot of the vets that we get are kind of in that place. They're so used to wearing camouflage that they don't have that interview attire," Gutierrez said. Job seekers who would like to attend the hiring event should call (323) 543-8440 or e-mail sconliffe@goodwillsocal.org to register. Some employers require online application and resume submission prior to the event. According to GSC, the city of Los Angeles is close to meeting its goal of hiring 10,000 Veterans by 2017. "We're at 8,150 right now, so we're well ahead of schedule, and what we're doing is we're working with all of our nonprofit partners," said Blas Villalobos with the mayor's Office of Veterans Affairs.

(Photo Credit: David McNally) VIEW ORIGINAL 6 / 6 Show Caption + Hide Caption – In austere environments with lots of sand and dust, Army aviators risk engine loss without a technology solution to protect their gas turbine engines. Army researchers are searching for a sandphobic coating. (Photo Credit: U.S. Army) VIEW ORIGINAL ABERDEEN PROVING GROUND, Md. -- Armor offers reliable protection against external forces, but what if the enemy is so small that it can take aircraft down from the inside? Sand and dust can significantly damage helicopter engines, which is why scientists and engineers at the Army Research Laboratory are experimenting with coatings in high-temperature environments with the goal of creating something -- anything -- that will cause sand to slide off the inside of a turbine engine the way an egg slides off a nonstick skillet. "We are going through a very methodical process to understand the underpinning science and then use the science to predict the materials, what we call the engineered or tailored materials, that will lead to the right solution," explained Dr. Anindya Ghoshal, chief scientist for the laboratory's Vehicle Technology Directorate. Ghoshal leads the Army's efforts to develop what he calls "sandphobic" coatings. In regions like Southwest Asia, he said, Army forces frequently must contend with brown-out conditions, during which sand particulates and other dust particulates are ingested into the engines. "Our goal is to have the particles strike the blades or vanes [inside a gas turbine engine] and then flake off," he said. "When we started looking into this problem, we found ... we want to understand the physical, chemical behavior. Once we can do that, then our idea is to take that model and then predict the type of material that would enable us to develop this sandphobic coating." Helicopters already have filtration systems that attempt to filter out larger particles, but Ghoshal said micron-sized particles can pass through the turbine's combustor and adhere to the blades. This chokes the airflow and can lead to engine loss. "We have a unique rig here," said Dr. Michael Walock, a physicist on the sandphobic coatings team. "The hot particulate ingestion rig allows us to shoot sand into the hot-gas flow at small level components and rapidly prototype new coating materials. With this system we've done a world-first. We used high-speed imaging to confirm the molten state of the sand particles impacting onto these thermal barrier coatings." Computer simulations are also helping researchers arrive at a technology solution. "Computer modeling will play a big role in helping us to look at the interactions between particles and the surface," said Dr. Muthuvel Murugan, acting team lead for the lab's Turbomachinery Research Team. "The particles go through a phase change from solid to liquid and then they deposit onto the surface." At the Army's Vehicle Research Laboratory, the team shot high-speed videos, revealing molten sand particles splattering on turbine blade material targets and then vaporizing -- a first in the scientific community. "Computer modeling of this multi-physics complex phenomena will allow us to understand the damage mechanisms," Murugan said. Murugan said they hope to use the power of supercomputers at the Department of Defense High Performance Computing Center also located at APG. "We will use advanced computational fluid dynamics, together with particle ingestion, to better understand the interaction mechanisms of sand particles at a gas-turbine-engine-relevant high temperature," he said. "When we simulate how particles go through the flow-field and impact and adhere to the surface, then we can understand the vulnerable parts of the turbine blade and engineer a sandphobic coatings solution." Sandphobic coatings research is part of a larger strategic effort the Army lab officials call the Science for Maneuver Campaign. "With this campaign, we hope to discover, innovate and transition science and technology-enabled capabilities that will significantly increase the force effectiveness and global responsiveness of the Army," said acting ARL Director Dr. Philip Perconti. "As we look to how we're going to enable the Army of the future, we see a need to discover technology solutions that will result in improvements in aviation responsiveness and the minimization of vulnerabilities." Earlier this year, Ghoshal's team received DOD funding through the Laboratory University Collaboration Initiative, or LUCI, which means $600,000 over three years in collaboration with a National Security Science and Engineering Faculty fellow. Ghoshal is teaming with Dr. Jian Luo at the University of California San Diego. "There is a close collaboration going on within the community to solve this problem," Ghoshal said. Ghoshal is also working closely with other universities, industry and government agencies, such as The Ohio State University; University of Connecticut; University of North Texas; Iowa State University; University of North Dakota; Boeing; the Army Aviation and Missile Research, Development and Engineering Center; the Air Force Research Laboratory; the Naval Air Systems Command; and NASA. In 2015, the team presented initial findings, "Turbomachinery Blade Thermomechanical Interface Science and Sandphobic Coatings Research," to the American Helicopter Society International 71st Annual Forum at Virginia Beach, Virginia. The paper received the "Best Paper Award in Propulsion Sessions" at the conference, Ghoshal said. New research from the team will also be published in the January 2017 Advances in Aircraft and Spacecraft Sciences, an international journal. "I strongly believe that, in the next three to five years, we will have not only one, but several solutions," Ghoshal said. "It will definitely save a lot of Soldiers' lives in the long run.

Post Your Comments Share Cancel | 1 Comments Aviation regulator DGCA has sought from Jet Airways details of the flights it had cancelled and delayed recently after some of its pilots reported sick amid an acute shortage of flight crew, particularly in its narrow body fleet. Jet Airways has also been asked to provide details of the pilots who are "habitual" of reporting sick and disrupting the airline's schedule, an official said. The Mumbai-headquartered airline, which is already facing paucity of pilots to carry out its operations in a smooth manner, had cancelled 50-odd flights on Tuesday and Wednesday after a section of its pilots did not turn up for duty despite being rostered in protest against the malfunctioning of its new crew rostering management system. "We have asked Jet Airways to provide us details of the flights it cancelled on November 1 and November 2. It has been asked to provide the number of flights it cancelled as well as the number of pilots who reported sick," a senior DGCA official said today. The airline has also been told to provide details of the pilots who do not turn up for duty and keep passengers waiting inside the aircraft. Jet Airways requires at least 200 more pilots to carry out its operations in a seamless manner, with its Boeing 737 fleet taking the maximum hit due to the inadequate number of flight crew in the airline, sources had said. Bollywood star Abhishek Bachchan had last week hit out at the airline after his flight to Chennai from Mumbai was allegedly delayed due to non-availability of flight crew. "Flying to Chennai. Baggage, check. Board flight on time, check. Seat belt fastened, check. Only thing we need now are our pilots!!...Well done Jet Airways!!! Entire plane boarded without any pilots on board. Still waiting and hoping...," he had said in a series of tweets over the nearly one-and-a-half- hour delay. The full service carrier is second largest airline in terms of number of domestic operations after no-frills IndiGo, operating more than 600 domestic and international flights every day. The airline at present has around 1,200 pilots to operate its fleet of 117 aircraft comprising Boeing 777s, B737s, Airbus A330s and ATRs. Almost two-thirds of its fleet consist of B737s. As part of the winter schedule, which became effective from late last month, Jet Airways would operate 3,010 flights per week while its subsidiary JetLite 507 flights per week.

The move comes as carriers in the U.S. and around the world are rolling out new premium economy class seating for their long-range jetliners, aimed at filling the increasing gulf between the front and back of the plane. The new premium economy class, dubbed ‘Delta Premium’ will add a new class of seating onto its upcoming Airbus A350s, which begin international service in late 2017. The new section will be arranged at eight seats across each row, with two outermost seats separated by the aisles. Each 19-inch wide seat will feature a 13.3-inch in-flight entertainment screen, in-seat power ports and 38 inches of pitch, a measurement of the distance between the same point on two seats. That’s about six to seven inches of additional legroom and an inch wider than standard economy seating. In addition to the larger seat, passengers on-board will receive a beverage before departure, an amenity kit, premium blanket and noise canceling headphones. At the airport a Delta Premium ticket will get you faster check-in and security lines, as well as earlier boarding and expedited baggage return. Delta’s move follows American Airlines introduction of a premium economy class for its long-haul jetliners as well. Airlines around the world such as Lufthansa, Singapore Airlines, Cathay Pacific, Air New Zealand, Air France and Iberia have all added new premium economy sections to their planes. As opulent first class seats have faded from use, airlines have focused on courting high-value business travelers with fully lie-flat seat beds and other hotel-like amenities. Such tickets can run as much as a compact car, while an economy class seat has remained largely the same through the history of jet flying, wildly separating a passenger’s experience. Airlines are seeking to tap into a quickly growing market for more-frugal business travelers and economy fliers who are willing to value comfort and space over the price of a seat, said Henry Harteveldt, founder of the Atmosphere Research Group. “As they develop these [premium economy] products there’s a balance between the premium side and the economy side,” said Harteveldt. “You want it attractive enough to attract someone from a standard economy fare…but you don’t want it to be so good that someone who usually flies business class will trade down to premium economy.” The Atlanta-based airline will first fit its new long-range A350s with 48 Delta Premium seats, and plans to deploy the new class on its Boeing 777s starting in 2018. Delta said its other jets may be added over time. Delta also plans to introduce an all-new business class seat with fully-closing door on its A350s. American’s own competing premium economy seating debuts on international flights starting with its new Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner on Thursday night, connecting Dallas-Fort Worth to Sao Paulo and Dallas-Fort Worth to Madrid Friday evening. The airline currently sells those seats under its Main Cabin Extra economy product rather than a distinct class, that begins next year. Neither Delta nor American have said how much their new premium seats will cost compared to a standard economy fare.   TM & © 2016 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

Jordan Chittley/The Globe and Mail Jordan Chittley The Globe and Mail Last updated: Thursday, Nov. 03, 2016 12:14PM EDT Share via email Share on facebook Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on Google Shares Comment s Anna Carroca casually strolls into action as a loud, piercing bell rings throughout the beige marble halls of a four-storey office town in downtown Toronto. She walks into a green, cream-and-gold elevator cab, looks up at the panel for the requested floor, closes the cage door, grasps a black lever and pushes it to the left, and the elevator shoots toward the sky. Jordan Chittley/The Globe and Mail “Left is going up and right is going down,” Carroca says, as we soar up the elevator shaft. “It has a brake, and you have full power to stop as if you were driving a car.” After 14 years at the elevator controls, Carroca makes it look easy. She jokes with tenants and rarely misses floors. If the operator doesn’t stop in the right spot, he or she may have to readjust or force a passenger to step up or down into the cab. She won’t let me operate it because there is a risk of damaging the elevator. Self-driving cars Take a drive in a 108-year-old manually controlled elevator in Toronto 2:02 Most elevators were manually operated before the Second World War. Today, this one, built in 1908 at the Ontario Heritage Centre at 10 Adelaide St. E., is one of a few remaining in Toronto. Others are at the Goodenham (Flatiron) building, the Masonic Temple and the Gladstone Hotel. “It’s a very rare and vanishing type,” says Romas Bubelis, architect with the Ontario Heritage Trust. “The visceral feeling you have as the air rushes by as you move up through the elevator shaft and being dependent on the elevator operator’s hand … is anything but a dead automatic experience.” The historic Birkbeck building at 10 Adelaide Street East in Toronto in the 1930s Ontario Heritage Trust In the middle of the 19th century, Elisha Otis invented a game-changing safety mechanism that prevented an elevator from falling even if its cable broke, says Rob Isabelle, CEO of KJA, an elevator-consulting firm. By the turn of the 20th century, electric, manually operated elevators were commonplace in New York and were being installed in Toronto buildings. “Most buildings into the 1950s had people waiting there to take you,” says Lee Gray, professor of architectural history at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, and author of a book about the history of elevators. “Until we get to the 1950s there is a recognition the elevator needs a driver … You couldn’t get by without an operator because you or I couldn’t drive the car. I tried to do it once and missed by six inches.” In the early 1950s, push-button elevators were introduced en masse. Building owners could save money on operators and automated elevators increased efficiency and capacity. But there was a problem – people hated them. “We have clear stories of people walking into elevators and walking right back out,” Gray says. “Passengers were saying, ‘I don’t want to drive this thing, where is the operator?’” Many people didn’t feel comfortable giving up control to a machine, where all they had to do was push a button.

We aren’t actually on a plane, but in a flight simulator in Mississauga, for Johnson to demonstrate how the autopilot system works. He’s looking at small, out-of-date screens, pushing buttons and turning small knobs. There are hundreds of them. Capt. Rob Johnson sits in the pilot’s seat in a simulator at uFly in Mississauga, Ont. Jordan Chittley/The Globe and Mail “Once you lift off and fly the aircraft off the runway, gear is coming up, engage the automation, you can leave it [autopilot] in all the way until you disconnect for the final approach,” says Johnson, who has been piloting aircraft for 45 years – including fighter jets and on 15-hour flights on Boeing 777s. “Some [pilots] leave it in until 300 or 400 feet above the runway.” About a minute after the rubber leaves the tarmac, Johnson hits one button, double checks some settings and then calmly removes his hands from the yoke. Blink, and you’d miss the computer taking control. Self-Driving Cars How autopilot works and how it has changed flying 2:19 Johnson says pilots use autopilot 99 per cent of the time, and it can be used at many airports to land. But the system is only as good as the information input by the pilot. Autopilot allows pilots to focus on other issues such as navigating around approaching weather. Prior to autopilot, flying was a grueling, dangerous experience. It was cold, windy and insanely loud – plus oil flew everywhere and the pilot had to constantly pull the plane to the left to compensate for the rotary engine. Constant attention was required to keep the plane on a straight course. “The sheer physical fatigue that came from flying could quickly wear a man down, something not easy to understand for those of us who fly cosseted in the passenger cabin of a jet liner,” Lee Kennett wrote in his 1991 book, The First Air War. In 1912, Sperry Corp. developed the first autopilot system. It connected a gyroscopic heading indicator and attitude indicator to hydraulically operate elevators and rudders (the devices that move the plane up, down and side to side). It allowed the plane to fly straight and level on a compass course with little attention from the pilot. Inventor Lawrence Sperry showed it off in 1914 by flying past onlookers in Paris with his hands up in the air and off the controls. “Over Ohio the other day, a big tri-motored Ford plowed through the air on its way to Washington, D.C. Four men leaned back at ease in the passenger cabin. Yet the pilot’s compartment was empty. A metal airman, scarcely larger than an automobile battery, was holding the stick,” begins a February 1930 article in Popular Science Monthly. “The sensitiveness of the robot in responding to movements of the plane is said to be superior to that of the average human pilot.” Aviation historian Keith Hyde says pilots were initially skeptical of autopilot and wary of turning over control, but technology improved over decades. “Today, a pilot, even though he has to go through the courses … doesn’t have much to do [while flying],” Hyde says. The cockpit of a Boeing 777 flight simulator at uFly in Mississagua, Ont. uFly As we approach the landing strip in Montreal, a pleasant voice announces how many feet we are above the ground. Johnson monitors the screens and keeps his hands close to the controls, but doesn’t touch them. The plane lands smoothly, but a little to the left, so Johnson disengages the system and drives it back to centre. So why do we still need pilots? To make the decisions, Johnson says. “You program bad information and it will give you bad results,” he says. “The pilot in command is ultimately responsible for the safety of the aircraft … Somebody has to mind the store.” 104 years after the first autopilot, the system can do a lot, but it can’t take responsibility. This is the first article in a seven-part multimedia series on self-driving cars that examines the past, the current technology and what the future may hold.

(Xinhua/Liang Xu) ZHUHAI, Nov. 3  -- On Wednesday, China's Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC) and Russia's United Aircraft Corporation (UAC) revealed their latest progress in a joint venture to develop a long-range wide-body aircraft. According to UAC President Yury Slyusar, the UAC will be responsible for the development of the wings, while COMAC will be in charge of the fuselage. "We value very much on self-made commercial aircraft and we need capable partners to achieve that. China has the ability, as we can see from the successful development of their ARJ21 and C919 aircraft," said Slyusar in an interview with Xinhua. From merely a supplier of aircraft components to a partner that designs and manufactures the aircraft, China is playing a bigger role in the world's aviation market. At the ongoing 11th China International Aviation & Aerospace Exhibition in Zhuhai, south China's Guangdong Province, a number of international products on display involve some "China elements." The Airbus A350, for example, involves a number of patented technologies developed by Chinese engineers. According to Airbus, Chinese companies manufactured 5 percent of the aircraft. "Airbus created A350 together with China," said Chen Juming, president of Airbus China. "Airbus showed its commitment in cooperating with China by allowing Chinese engineers to participate." On Tuesday, Honeywell announced that it would work with Aero Engine Corporation of China (AECC) on a number of initiatives concerning aircraft engines. Steven Lien, president of Honeywell Aerospace Asia Pacific, described the cooperation as "expertise sharing." "Honeywell has been an important industry player in the development of engines since 1953," he said. "This agreement between Honeywell and AECC is a new way to share expertise and explore new opportunities." Besides sharing its technical know-how to global aviation giants, China is also playing a bigger role contributing to the industry's growth. On Tuesday, Boeing signed an agreement with COMAC to expand their joint research collaboration in support of the long-term sustainable growth of commercial aviation. Through the new agreement signed at the Zhuhai Airshow, the companies will explore research in areas such as sustainable aviation fuel and better recycling of materials. "Boeing and COMAC are expanding our efforts to ensure commercial aviation's long-term sustainable growth, improve its efficiency and reduce environmental impact," said Ian Chang, vice president of supplier management China operations and business development at Boeing Commercial Airplanes. In the future, Boeing would like to deal with Chinese companies in a broader scope, said John Bruns, president of Boeing China. "Almost every Boeing aircraft in service globally has some 'made in China' element," he said. "We can clearly see that how much progress that China's aviation industry has made."

All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. SEATTLE (CNNMoney) Delta Air Lines on Thursday unveiled a new premium economy class seat for its airliners, seeking to tap into the fast-growing market for frugal business travelers and economy fliers who value comfort over price. The move comes as carriers in the U.S. and around the world are rolling out new premium economy class seating for their long-range jetliners, aimed at filling the increasing gulf between the front and back of the plane. The new premium economy class, dubbed 'Delta Premium' will add a new class of seating onto its upcoming Airbus A350s, which begin international service in late 2017. The new section will be arranged at eight seats across each row, with two outermost seats separated by the aisles. Each 19-inch wide seat will feature a 13.3-inch in-flight entertainment screen, in-seat power ports and 38 inches of pitch, a measurement of the distance between the same point on two seats. That's about six to seven inches of additional legroom and an inch wider than standard economy seating. In addition to the larger seat, passengers on-board will receive a beverage before departure, an amenity kit, premium blanket and noise canceling headphones. At the airport a Delta Premium ticket will get you faster check-in and security lines, as well as earlier boarding and expedited baggage return. Delta's move follows American Airlines introduction of a premium economy class for its long-haul jetliners as well. Airlines around the world such as Lufthansa, Singapore Airlines, Cathay Pacific, Air New Zealand, Air France and Iberia have all added new premium economy sections to their planes. As opulent first class seats have faded from use, airlines have focused on courting high-value business travelers with fully lie-flat seat beds and other hotel-like amenities. Such tickets can run as much as a compact car, while an economy class seat has remained largely the same through the history of jet flying, wildly separating a passenger's experience. Airlines are seeking to tap into a quickly growing market for more-frugal business travelers and economy fliers who are willing to value comfort and space over the price of a seat, said Henry Harteveldt, founder of the Atmosphere Research Group. "As they develop these [premium economy] products there's a balance between the premium side and the economy side," said Harteveldt. "You want it attractive enough to attract someone from a standard economy fare...but you don't want it to be so good that someone who usually flies business class will trade down to premium economy." The Atlanta-based airline will first fit its new long-range A350s with 48 Delta Premium seats, and plans to deploy the new class on its Boeing 777s starting in 2018. Delta said its other jets may be added over time. Delta also plans to introduce an all-new business class seat with fully-closing door on its A350s. American's own competing premium economy seating debuts on international flights starting with its new Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner on Thursday night, connecting Dallas-Fort Worth to Sao Paulo and Dallas-Fort Worth to Madrid Friday evening. The airline currently sells those seats under its Main Cabin Extra economy product rather than a distinct class, that begins next year. Neither Delta nor American have said how much their new premium seats will cost compared to a standard economy fare. Copyright 2016 Cable News Network/Turner Broadcasting System, Inc.

 Text Size: A | A 21ST CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT  In 2014, when Democrat Bill Owens retired from Congress, many observers thought the House seat representing the North Country would be a tight race. In the end, though, Republican Elise Stefanik won handily to become the youngest woman ever to serve in Congress, at age 30. Stefanik is running for re-election this year in a contest that has seen less national attention than two years ago, but where campaigners are nevertheless spending millions of dollars. Stefanik has more money than Democrat Mike Derrick or Matt Funiciello, the Green Party candidate who garnered more than 10 percent of the vote two years ago and is running again. Stefanik, now 32, of Willsboro, Essex County, also has voter enrollment statistics on her side as she seeks to return to Congress. Elise Stefanik Elise Stefanik AGE: 32 HOME: Willsboro OCCUPATION: Congresswoman FAMILY: Engaged PARTY: Republican, Conservative, Independence, Reform New enrollment figures released this week show that the 21st Congressional District has 181,395 registered Republicans, 130,678 Democrats and 97,544 independent voters. The biggest gain in the last two years has been in independent voters, state Board of Elections statistics show. Polls show Stefanik with a substantial lead among likely voters. Stefanik, part of the conservative Republican majority in the House of Representatives, has highlighted her support for programs that help veterans and farmers. The district, which includes Fort Drum on the outskirts of Watertown, has the highest percentage of veterans of any district in New York state. “I have outworked my opponents and put forth original solutions,” Stefanik said at a candidate forum last month in Queensbury. Derrick is a retired Army officer from Peru, in Clinton County, the small town where he grew up and returned to after his military career, which included combat service in Iraq. He retired with the rank of colonel. “Two things have shaped me: growing up in Peru, New York, and service in the United States Army,” Derrick said. He believes more money needs to be spent on education and transportation and broadband infrastructure, and he has called for tax reform. “The wealthy and the powerful are not paying their fair share,” Derrick said. On the campaign trail, Derrick has regularly attacked Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump. Trump “has neither the character or the competence to be president of the United States,” he said. Mike Derrick William “Mike” Derrick AGE: 54 HOME: Peru OCCUPATION: Retired, 28-year U.S. Army veteran FAMILY: Married, four children PARTY: Democrat, Working Families Stefanik has tried to avoid discussing Trump, even fleeing from reporters, but has indicated she will not buck national GOP leaders who support him. Funiciello, of Glens Falls and owner of the Rock Hill Bakery in that city, said the nasty character of the presidential election has excluded discussion of issues important to the Green Party, including economic inequality, national health care and the environment. “I am proud to be a member of the working class,” Funiciello said at the Queensbury candidate forum. “We need to have the unique voice that comes from someone living in the district every day.” The 21st Congressional District is the geographically largest in the state, stretching from Ballston Spa in Saratoga County to the Canadian border, and from Lake Champlain to Lake Ontario. With media markets in the Capital Region, Watertown and Plattsburgh, both major party candidates have invested heavily in television advertising. As of Oct. 19, Stefanik had raised more than $2.9 million and spent more than $2.2 million, which left her with $753,433 in the bank, according to federal records. She has raised $1.35 million from dozens of political action committees, including the corporate PACs of such industrial giants as Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Coca-Cola and Wal-Mart. Koch Industries, run by the conservative Koch brothers, has donated $10,000 to her through its PAC. Matt Funiciello Matt Funiciello AGE: 49 HOME: Glens Falls OCCUPATION: Bakery owner FAMILY: Unmarried PARTY: Green Stefanik has also raised $1.27 million from individuals. Stefanik “is a Washington insider who is dedicated to party politics,” Derrick said. Derrick had raised $1.16 million and spent $1.1 million through Oct. 19, leaving him with $61,581 cash on hand. Derrick has raised $150,000 from political action committees, including some for labor unions and some from other Democrats’ campaign funds. He has raised $1 million from individuals. In contrast to such high-profile races at the John Faso-Zephyr Teachout race in the 19th Congressional District, only $217,000 has been spent by independent political committees, and all of it has been spent in support of Stefanik. The GOP’s Congressional Leadership Fund last month announced plans to spend $500,000 in the Watertown and Albany media markets, but that spending hasn’t yet shown up in federal filings. “In just two years, Elise Stefanik has delivered for her district and stood as a conservative, results-oriented leader in Congress,” said PAC spokeswoman Ruth Guerra. Funiciello, who has pointedly said he is accepting no corporate contributions, has raised $13,900, and had $7,563 of it left to spend as of Oct. 19. None of the candidates are providing significant self-funding. Reach Gazette reporter Stephen Williams at 395-3086, swilliams@dailygazette.net or @gazettesteve on Twitter. Enjoy this story? Share it!

The move comes as carriers in the U.S. and around the world are rolling out new premium economy class seating for their long-range jetliners, aimed at filling the increasing gulf between the front and back of the plane. The new premium economy class, dubbed ‘Delta Premium’ will add a new class of seating onto its upcoming Airbus A350s, which begin international service in late 2017. The new section will be arranged at eight seats across each row, with two outermost seats separated by the aisles. Each 19-inch wide seat will feature in-seat power ports and 38 inches of pitch, a measurement of the distance between the same point on two seats. That’s about six inches of additional legroom and an inch wider than standard economy seating. In addition to the larger seat, passengers on-board will receive a beverage before departure, an amenity kit, premium blanket noise canceling headphones. At the airport an Delta Premium ticket will get you faster check-in and security lines, as well as earlier boarding and expedited baggage return. Delta’s move follows American Airlines introduction of a premium economy class for its long-haul jetliners as well. Airlines around the world such as Lufthansa, Singapore Airlines, Cathay Pacific, Air New Zealand, Air France and Iberia have all added new premium economy sections to their planes. As opulent first class seats have faded from use, airlines have focused on courting high-value business travelers with fully lie-flat seat beds and other hotel-like amenities. Such tickets can run as much as a compact car, while an economy class seat has remained largely the same through the history of jet flying, wildly separating a passenger’s experience. Airlines are seeking to tap into a quickly growing market for more-frugal business travelers and economy fliers who are willing to value comfort and space over the price of a seat, said Henry Harteveldt, founder of the Atmosphere Research Group. “As they develop these [premium economy] products there’s a balance between the premium side and the economy side,” said Harteveldt. “You want it attractive enough to attract someone from a standard economy fare…but you don’t want it to be so good that someone who usually flies business class will trade down to premium economy.” The Atlanta-based airline will first fit its new long-range A350s with 48 Delta Premium seats, and plans to deploy the new class on its Boeing 777s starting in 2018. Delta said its other jets may be added over time. Delta also plans to introduce an all-new business class seat with fully-closing door on its A350s. American’s own competing premium economy seating debuts on international flights starting with its new Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner on Thursday night, connecting Dallas-Fort Worth to Sao Paulo and Dallas-Fort Worth to Madrid Friday evening. The airline currently sells those seats under its Main Cabin Extra economy product rather than a distinct class, that begins next year. Neither Delta nor American have said how much their new premium seats will cost compared to a standard economy fare.

The trades are coming in the form of bonds whose performance is tied to a group of shares. Leonteq AG, a Swiss provider of structured products, has seen “strong interest” for such notes in Singapore, said Frank Troise, head of digital distribution in the Asian city-state. He declined to provide sales figures, but said that more than four-fifths of the notes his firm has sold have bet on Clinton becoming the 45th President of the United States. "Investors are voting with their wallets," Troise said. "The expectation is that markets will rally substantially if Clinton does win." Clinton’s odds of winning were around 66 percent on Friday, according to poll aggregator FiveThirtyEight. Her chances have fallen from 82 percent on Oct. 27, the day before the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation said it had reopened its investigation into Clinton’s use of a personal e-mail server. Swiss bank Vontobel Holding AG is selling structured notes linked to stocks that should perform well if Clinton wins, as well as similar debt that would benefit from a Donald Trump victory. Eric Blattmann, head of public distribution of financial products at the bank and asset manager, reported sales of at least $10 million of notes that profit on either a Clinton or trump win. A Twist The Vontobel notes feature an unusual twist: they will only be issued if the candidate that clients are betting on actually wins. If an investor buys Clinton notes and Trump wins, customers will receive their money back. Both Clinton and Trump notes tend to include exposure to infrastructure companies such as Caterpillar Inc., because both candidates have promised to push for greater investment in highways, bridges and other projects.  A Clinton win could be a boon for hospital operators such as HCA Holdings Inc. , which may benefit from continued Affordable Care Act subsidies, according to analysts from Credit Suisse Group AG. HCA is in Vontobel’s “ Clinton” note, as is United Parcel Service Inc., which could benefit from the fact the candidate is seen as more supportive of trade than her opponent.   Banks, Defense Vontobel’s “ Trump”certificates are tied to U.S banks including JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc., as well as military contractors including Boeing Co. and Honeywell International Inc. Trump has spoken about repealing and replacing the Dodd-Frank Act, which requires banks to trim some risk-taking, fund their businesses with more capital, and submit to more oversight. Cutting back or ending that law could boost banks’ near-term profits, and financial companies’ shares have tended to be the most closely tied of any industry to Trump’s chances. Trump has also proposed increases in defense spending. Leonteq is selling one-year notes that offer relatively high income, but if a candidate loses, the client will lose principal. For example, one Clinton note yields 14.3 percent, and is tied to shares of several hospital providers, including HCA. If one of the stocks drops 35 percent or more, which is less likely under Clinton, the client will lose principal. One Trump note yields 17.08 percent, and is tied to shares of several student lending companies, including SLM Corp. If one of the stocks falls 35 percent, which is less likely if the real estate magnate wins, the client will lose principal. While equity-linked notes have been most popular, investors have also bought notes tied to currencies, according to Leonteq’s Troise. A Leonteq note bets on the dollar to strengthen against both sterling and the euro. “Sentiment is that the dollar will be stronger with a Clinton win. If Trump wins, we could see a market sell-off and the Fed cutting rates which would weaken the dollar,” said Troise. This story was originally published in Bloomberg Briefs: Structured Notes.

Most offers include the jets and industrial cooperation."The situation here is obviously concentrating people's minds," said Robert Hewson, spokesman for Saab. "So we have found a lot of interest in people talking to us about our radar products, our airborne surveillance products, because they need to be able to extend their horizons."Indonesian President Joko Widodo had promised to double the country's defence budget, clean up procurement and modernize its ageing military equipment. Since he took office, the country's total defence spending has jumped around 26 percent - though next year should actually see a slight dip to 108 trillion rupiah ($8.3 billion).Much of the effort, as with other countries in the region, includes a push to bring skills to Indonesia through joint ventures and partnerships, like a deal with South Korea which analysts initially said could cost up to $8 billion, to develop a mid-level fighter jet programme. Korea Aerospace Industries said this week it is working with Indonesia's state-owned aerospace company Dirgantara Indonesia (PTDI) on joint marketing efforts, as well as a drone development programme for surveillance.French defence firm Thales said it was getting interest in its air defence offerings, after selling to Malaysia last year, as other countries consider how to upgrade existing technology with lasers to improve accuracy.Indonesia will also seek to upgrade its heavy-lift helicopters, and the annual show saw Boeing promoting additional Apache helicopters and its Chinook. Indonesia has already ordered eight AH-64E Apache helicopters."Maritime surveillance, and reconnaissance capabilities are moving to the forefront around the world and we certainly see that in Southeast Asia," a Boeing spokeswoman said.

Since he took office, the country's total defence spending has jumped around 26 percent - though next year should actually see a slight dip to 108 trillion rupiah ($8.3 billion). Much of the effort, as with other countries in the region, includes a push to bring skills to Indonesia through joint ventures and partnerships, like a deal with South Korea which analysts initially said could cost up to $8 billion, to develop a mid-level fighter jet programme. Korea Aerospace Industries said this week it is working with Indonesia's state-owned aerospace company Dirgantara Indonesia (PTDI) on joint marketing efforts, as well as a drone development programme for surveillance. French defence firm Thales said it was getting interest in its air defence offerings, after selling to Malaysia last year, as other countries consider how to upgrade existing technology with lasers to improve accuracy. Indonesia will also seek to upgrade its heavy-lift helicopters, and the annual show saw Boeing promoting additional Apache helicopters and its Chinook. Indonesia has already ordered eight AH-64E Apache helicopters.

Photo: Reuters mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 7:30 PM, November 5, 2016 Updated: 9:00 PM, November 5, 2016 JAKARTA - From rescue helicopters to air surveillance equipment, defense manufacturers jostled in Jakarta this week to claim one of the region's biggest prizes: a slice of Indonesia's shopping list as the country updates its aging air and sea security capability. While it is not part of the dispute over claims in the South China Sea, Indonesia objects to China's claim to waters around the Natuna Islands and has been ramping up military exercises and patrols in the region. At this year's annual defense gathering, just weeks after the largest Indonesian exercise to date off the Natuna archipelago, corridors were jammed and industry executives reported one of their busiest years at a time of high interest across the region after a lull of over five years. Indonesia, which faced a U.S. arms embargo until just over a decade ago, has yet to nail down a winner for the highest profile item on its wish list - a squadron of jets to replace its aging Northrop F-5 fighters, as talks continue with Russia to buy Sukhoi Su-35 jets. Rival contenders for the deal include the Saab Gripen combat jet, the Eurofighter Typhoon and Lockheed Martin's F-16s, according to industry stakeholders. Most offers include the jets and industrial cooperation. "The situation here is obviously concentrating people's minds," said Robert Hewson, spokesman for Saab. "So we have found a lot of interest in people talking to us about our radar products, our airborne surveillance products, because they need to be able to extend their horizons."

Anthony KeaneNews Corp Australia Network Share Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Google+ Share on Reddit Email a friend AUSTRALIANS’ personal finances are in the firing line of this week’s US presidential election. Economists say the impact of Tuesday’s vote may be unprecedented and could affect everything from inflation and home loans to superannuation and shares. Hillary Clinton has been the preferred choice of financial markets, which tumbled last week as her lead in the polls weakened. A win by Trump is tipped to trigger a global sharemarket sell-off — similar to June’s Brexit turmoil — because of fears his trade policies would damage global growth. Darryl Gobbett, chief economist of advice and stockbroking firm Baillieu Holst, said Mr Trump’s economic vision “until now has been blurry at best”. “The outlook for our interest rates, exchange rate, inflation and share market is heavily influenced by the policies and economic performance of the United States, whether we like it or not,” he said. Mr Gobbett said global financial markets had figured that a Clinton win will would be “more of the same” economic, financial and trade policies. “Financial markets don’t like surprises, uncertainty and volatility. In the event that Donald Trump snatches victory, I would expect equity markets and the Australian dollar would tumble at least for the short term.” With Clinton seen as steady-as-she-goes, the US election impact on everyday Australians would come from a Trump win. The consensus among financial experts appears to be that a Clinton victory will mean ‘more of the same’ for global financial markets, while a Trump win could usher in a period of instability. Picture: AFPSource:AFP MORTGAGES AMP Capital chief economist Shane Oliver said a Trump victory that sparked financial market weakness and stoked fears of a trade war would increase the chance of another Reserve Bank of Australia interest rate cut. “Investors globally worry that if he does win, it will lead to slow economic growth and possibly a global recession, and our part of the world is exposed to that,” he said. At least part of a RBA rate cut would flow through to mortgage interest rates. SAVINGS Rate cuts reduce the income paid on savings accounts, further eroding the income of retirees who have watched their returns slashed from 7 per cent to 3 per cent in recent years. SHOPPING AND BILLS A slower economy means lower inflation, so consumers will be happy about only small price rises — apart from energy and education bills, which never seem to slow. SHARES Dr Oliver said a Trump win could send share markets around the world tumbling between 5 and 10 per cent. “A Trump win would be seen as a global economic shock and cause a loss of confidence in sharemarkets,” he said. Mr Gobbett said both candidates favoured spending more on the military, which could create attractive investment opportunities in defence-rated companies such as Boeing, Lockheed Martin and British Aerospace. SUPERANNUATION A majority of people’s super fund assets sit in Australian and international shares, so a shares slowdown will hit short-term super fund returns. However, super is an investment over decades rather than weeks, and Dr Oliver said we could learn lessons from the kneejerk sell-off following the Britain’s Brexit vote in June. “After a few days global markets moved on to focus on other things. So there is a danger in making too much of the US election,” he said.

The software will be incorporated into student coursework and projects related to computer-aided-design, engineering simulation, industrial design, digital manufacturing and manufacturing management in Clemson’s College of Engineering, Computing and Applied Sciences. By providing students with hands-on experience with this software in academic programs, Clemson is preparing a highly-skilled STEM workforce for the advanced manufacturing industry. Through the in-kind investment, Clemson students now will have access to the same Siemens product lifecycle management (PLM) software used by more than 140,000 companies throughout the global manufacturing industry – including 35 in South Carolina – to design, develop and manufacture some of the world’s most sophisticated products in a variety of industries, including aerospace, automotive, medical devices, machinery, shipbuilding and high-tech electronics. This academic partnership will help students compete for jobs throughout the world, and aid in building a workforce equipped with the skills needed for the high-tech jobs of tomorrow. As software plays an increasing role in the next era of manufacturing, this PLM software bundle – including Siemens’ LMS™ software, NX™ software, Fibersim™ portfolio, Tecnomatix® portfolio, and Femap™ software – is designed to benefit students at both the undergraduate and graduate levels in the university’s College of Engineering, Computing and Applied Sciences. The software will be used in junior and senior level classes in the mechanical engineering and bioengineering departments, as well as by competitive teams at Clemson, such as Formula SAE. At the graduate level, the software also will be used in the automotive engineering department. Joerg Schulte, manager of BMW Liaison Office for Research and Innovation and adjunct professor, teaches automotive manufacturing, a required class for all master’s students in Clemson’s automotive engineering program. The class project, to design a production plant for a fictitious company, challenges the students to apply what they have learned in a simulated, yet realistic setting. “We can’t build that up in reality, so in order to get as close to reality as we can, this PLM software from Siemens is crucial,” Schulte said. “Without this software, it wouldn’t be possible for the students to really get to the detail of what it means to run a production system – from how many stations you need to what kind of cycle time each station has to how the manufacturing plant works with suppliers.” The software will help students realize their ideas by providing accurate information as the product moves from design to prototype through a streamlined manufacturing process that provides instant feedback and allows product developers to make adjustments. Clemson’s dedication to technology and innovation makes the university an ideal recipient for the in-kind software grant. With the university’s vision to create a high-tech collaborative environment through the Watt Family Innovation Center, Clemson shares Siemens’ commitment to fostering innovation, advancing technology and developing the next-generation workforce. Siemens provides technology for innovative companies with major operations in South Carolina, including BMW, Boeing and Duke Energy.

The target for average annual earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, and rental costs in the 2016 to 2020 period was lowered to EUR5.3 billion ($5.9 billion). Last year, the airline company raised the level from an average of EUR5 billion to about EUR5.6 billion. IAG last week cut its 2016 earnings outlook because of the sharp fall in sterling. The company reports earnings in euros, but the British Airways unit that generates most profit principally sells tickets in pounds, which are now worth less after the Brexit vote. The referendum in June drove the British currency to a more than 30-year low. The currency staged a small a rally Thursday after the U.K. High Court said parliament would have to give its backing before Prime Minister Theresa May can trigger the exit process, which is expected to take at least two years. European airline overcapacity has contributed to a sharp fall in ticket prices this year, one of several headwinds for European airlines, which also have had to contend with depressed bookings from terrorist attacks and strikes that have led to flight cancellations. The London-based airline group said it would deliver a full-year operating profit this year of EUR2.5 billion. It had already revised its outlook down to low double-digit growth in its adjusted operating profit beyond the EUR2.3 billion generated in 2015. IAG began the year expecting to deliver an operating profit of about EUR3.2 billion. IAG Friday said capacity through the end of the decade is now expected to grow only around 3% a year from a previous forecast of 3% to 4%. IAG this year has cut growth plans several times. Capital expenditure plans for items such as planes were cut to EUR1.7 billion a year from EUR2.5 billion the previous year. IAG Chief Executive Willie Walsh has indicated the group may buy or rent used planes over new ones to help lower costs. The airline is looking at the secondhand market for Boeing Co. 777 widebodies and Airbus Group SE A380 superjumbos. IAG left unchanged other medium-term targets, including a sustainable 15% return on invested capital, an operating profit margin of 12% to 15% and average earnings-per-share growth of more than 12% a year. The company's free cash flow expectation remains at EUR1.5 billion to EUR2.5 billion a year.

November 4, 20163:04pm Don’t even bother trying to open this mid flight. news.com.au Share Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Google+ Share on Reddit Email a friend IT’S something we’ve all worried about — and it might even be something a few of us have felt the overwhelming urge to try in a moment of wild imagination. Is it possible to open a plane door mid-flight? According to Australian Federal Police, a passenger tried to do just that on an Air Canada flight from Vancouver to Brisbane yesterday. The Sunshine Coast man, 25, allegedly couldn’t wait the final 10 minutes before the end of the 15-hour-flight and tried to yank the exit door open while the plane was still in the air, and was tackled to the ground by a another passenger before being arrested in Brisbane. And there are plenty of passengers who have tried to pull off the midair door-opening trick. A woman tried to open the front cabin door of a Jetstar plane as the flight approached Avalon from Sydney in May. And in August, an Air Alaska flight between New York and Seattle was diverted to Minneapolis when a passenger tried to open the rear cabin door. Sometimes it’s an accident, such as with a passenger on a China Southern Airlines flight in March who mistook the emergency exit for a toilet door and opened it, triggering the emergency slide. Notably, the plane was still on the runway during that incident. But it is possible to actually open a door while the plane is hurtling through the sky? According to airline pilot and former US air force aviator Ron Wagner, who addressed this question on a Quora forum recently, it was technically possible — but there was a huge caveat. “Sure, no problem at all, if you’re strong enough to pull sideways with three to four tonnes of force,” he said. The pilot said occasionally a flight attendant would rush into the cockpit to report a passenger trying to open the emergency row exit door, but “we just laughed and told her to ignore him. Because it is funny,” he said. “At cruise altitude, the average exit hatch has about three to four tons [2.7 to 3.6 tonnes] of pressure holding it in place. Even on the ground, once the pressurisation is turned on, there’s maybe 400 to 800 pounds [181 to 362kg] of pressure. Yes, airliners pressurise a bit on the ground, which prevents pressure bumps that would pop your eardrums during takeoff. “It’s less than 1 psi [pounds per square inch], but multiply that by hundreds of square inches and you’ll see that even if we went back to try to stop the guy, even on the ground, if he was strong enough to pull it out, we weren’t going to stop him.” OK, BUT CAN DOORS OPEN THEMSELVES MID-FLIGHT? Wagner then explained why main doors don’t blow open midair — they open outward. “Airliner doors are ingeniously designed,” he said. “Few people realise it, but it’s some really excellent engineering. “Upon closing, the door swings inside the cabin and then nestles outward into a frame where the door becomes a plug. They’re called plug doors. In aviation, you always want physics to work in your favour, so cabin doors use physics to remain in place rather than fighting physics with some massive locking mechanism. “Without this design, eventually with daily use on tens of thousands of planes, over decades, one of these locking mechanisms would eventually break and a door would open in flight. I’ve never heard of a plug-type cabin door opening in flight.” Wagner said designers have not always used that principle on all aircraft doors. The lower baggage bins on the ill-fated McDonnell Douglas DC-10 aircraft used a locking mechanism, similar to a bank vault, that deteriorated with thousands of uses by baggage handlers and became notorious for failing. A notable, tragic example of that was Turkish Airlines flight 981 that crashed into a forest in France in 1974, killing all 346 people on board. “The rear cargo door blew out with such force that the entire aircraft frame buckled,” Wagner said, adding that McDonnell Douglas planes were never as strong as Boeing aircraft. “The buckled floors left the control cables under the floor hanging slack. The pilots’ yokes in the cockpit were just loose and floppy. All they could do was let everyone pray while they watched the plane slowly go out of control and crash. “This crash resulted in a complete redesign of the locking mechanism, and no more DC-10 nor MD-11 cargo doors have blown out. But those accidents, combined with others caused by sloppy design, eventually caused the DC-10s to cease passenger operations. They now only carry freight.” So the short story is: you won’t be able to open the door, so don’t bother trying it — unless you want to get arrested. Five Most Irritating Habits You Do on a Plane1:35 A flight was diverted on Monday when a passenger was allegedly found behaving inappropriately on board and then tried to open the cabin door. While such instances are rare, these five annoying plane passenger habits are not.
