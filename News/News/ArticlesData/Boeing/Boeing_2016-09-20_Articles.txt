The grants are geared toward programs that enhance STEM, workforce training, and educational and career pathway opportunities for students – particularly for underserved students who have not historically pursued these career paths. Included in these grants is $1 million to further support students seeking a STEM education and enhanced learning opportunities at local universities. Boeing expects a substantial portion of its Washington workforce to retire during the next several years and is working to ensure that students in the state have the education and skills to fill these openings and move with the company into its second century. These grants support Boeing’s long-standing commitment to Washington and will prepare the workforce for these opportunities in the near future. “Boeing will be a significant jobs provider in Washington for decades to come. Our hope and goal is that those future jobs will continue to be filled by kids who grow up right here in the state,” said Boeing Commercial Airplanes President and CEO Ray Conner. “We are working hard today to give Washington students opportunities for employment within aerospace, manufacturing and other STEM-related fields when they graduate. Despite the always dynamic aerospace industry, Boeing remains consistent in its investment in our future here in Washington.” The university grants awarded by Boeing are: University of Washington (UW): $500,000 to help under-represented high school students attend and succeed at UW, including support for the Dream Project, which trains students to mentor first-generation and low-income high school students. Washington State University (WSU): $250,000 to support new coursework and equip new labs at WSU’s North Puget Sound at Everett campus, currently scheduled to open in 2017. The campus’ new Fabrication Lab will be named the Boeing Innovation Studio. Seattle University: $250,000 for the College of Science and Engineering to improve retention rates of non-traditional students in undergraduate engineering and computer science programs. The additional $5 million in grants, ranging from $25,000 to $550,000, are designed to provide a continuum of learning and education resources for Washington’s younger residents. Some of the largest grants will support: Thrive Washington and its focus upon early learning; Washington STEM and its K-12 learning initiatives; and SkillUp Washington and its manufacturing pathways partnership with community and technical colleges.

The approvals from the US Treasury Department allow both aerospace giants to proceed with sales worth billions of dollars into a country that had been entirely off limits prior to the landmark 2015 nuclear deal. "We have issued the first two licenses for the export of certain commercial passenger aircraft to Iran under this new policy -- to Boeing and Airbus," said a Treasury spokesperson. "These licenses contain strict conditions to ensure that the planes will be used exclusively for commercial passenger use and cannot be resold or transferred" to any Iranian entity still under US sanctions, the spokesperson said. The approval allows Boeing to fulfill its June memorandum of agreement (MOA) with Iran Air that covered the sale of 80 planes, consisting of the single-aisle 737 and the long-range 777. Boeing will also lease 29 other planes to the Iranian national carrier under the deal. "We applied for a US government license that would allow us to complete the sales anticipated in the MOA," said Boeing spokesman Marc Sklar. "We have received that license and remain in talks with Iran Air based on the MOA." The deal is estimated to be worth roughly $25 billion. The Boeing sales would be the first from a US aviation company to an Iranian entity since the 1979 Islamic revolution. Additional sales would require another license, said a person familiar with the matter. Airbus struck a similar preliminary agreement in January to sell Iran 118 aircraft, but it also required US approval because some of the planes' components are made in the United States. The deal includes the single-aisle A320 and the long-range A330. An Airbus spokesperson said it had received the first of two licenses applied for on Tuesday and expected the second one "in the coming weeks". The Airbus deal was initially valued at $25 billion (22.4 billion euros) but Iranian officials say it is worth nearer $10 billion. Neither Airbus nor Boeing has announced a schedule for delivering the planes. Before the nuclear deal under which Iran has curbed its atomic program in return for a lifting of international sanctions, an embargo dating from 1995 prevented Western manufacturers from selling equipment and spare parts to Iranian companies. The restrictions, which have been blamed for crippling the industry, were partly lifted by an interim agreement on Iran's nuclear program that came into force in January 2014. Iran's current commercial aviation fleet, which has a poor air safety record, numbers around 140 planes with an average age of around 20 years, with many in desperate need of replacement. Iran projects a demand for between 400 and 500 commercial airliners over the next decade. Boeing's deal with Iran drew scorn from some on Capitol Hill. Lawmakers on a panel in the House of Representatives enacted a measure to block the sales, but it did not win support in the full Congress. burs-jmb/pmh © 2016 AFP 0 Comments To This Article Leave a Reply Most Read Rallying: Photographer killed by rally c...

(Boeing) GILLIAN RICH 9/21/2016 Reprints Boeing (BA) received U.S. government approval Wednesday to sell passenger jets to Iran, following a similar OK for Airbus (EADSY). The Treasury Department issued a government license giving Boeing approval to sell planes to the Islamic republic for the first time since its 1979 revolution. After sanctions over Iran's nuclear program were lifted early this year, Boeing and Iran reached a tentative deal in June for more than 100 commercial planes. But the deal faced political opposition over worries that parts in the commercial planes could be used for military purposes, like in the country's aging F-15s. Boeing shares closed up 2.2% to 130.56 in the stock market today. IBD'S TAKE: Boeing's commercial sales have been lagging, but its defense arm is booming and the Pentagon faces new threats from Russia, China, Syria and North Korea. The Air Force is already looking at a follow on to Boeing's KC-46 tanker that could feature high tech advances like radar-absorbing material and a laser. Airbus confirmed that it had received governmental approval to sell its jets to Iran late Tuesday. Airbus' U.S. listed shares rose 1.1% to close at 14.80. The country could be a lucrative market for the aerospace giants, which have suffered from lagging sales in recent months. In June, IranAir Chairman Farhad Parvaresh told Reuters that Iran needs at least 300 aircraft in the next 10 years and that 90 of the country's 250 aircraft have been grounded due to missing or broken parts.

The next administration, however, may change that equation for Airbus and Chicago-based Boeing Co., which has its own $25 billion deal on the line with Iran that would be the biggest for an American company since the 1979 Islamic Revolution and U.S. Embassy takeover. Though based abroad, Airbus needed the approval of the U.S. Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control for the deal as at least 10 percent of Airbus components are of American origin. Airbus applied for two licenses to cover its deal with Iran to ensure the fast delivery of some of the aircraft, Airbus spokesman Justin Dubon told The Associated Press. The license announced Wednesday covers the first 17 planes involved in the deal, which will be will be A320s and A330s, he said. Dubon declined to offer a breakdown of how many of each model are involved in the initial sale, but said Airbus hoped to receive a second license allowing it to sell the remaining planes to Iran. Iran's U.N. mission did not respond to a request for comment Wednesday. State television referred to an AP report on the sale. In January, national carrier Iran Air signed agreements to buy 118 planes from Airbus, estimated to be worth some 22.8 billion euros ($25 billion). The deal included 21 A320ceos, 24 A320neos, 27 A330ceos, 18 A330neos, 16 A350-1000s and 12 double-decker A380s. On Sunday, Asghar Fakhrieh Kashan, a deputy transportation minister, told reporters that he expected U.S. permission for all aircraft purchases "by the end of September" and that several airplanes would arrive by mid-March. However, he also said Iran would cut the number of Airbus planes it would buy to 112, state TV reported. Base model A320s are listed at an average of $98 million, while A330s start at $231.5 million. That puts the value of the approved 17 aircraft in the first license around at least $1.8 billion and possibly much higher based on list prices, though buyers typically negotiate sizable discounts for bulk orders. Most Iranian planes were purchased before the Islamic Revolution that ousted Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi and brought Islamists to power. Out of Iran's 250 commercial planes, 162 were flying in June, while the rest are grounded due to lack of spare parts. Iran's nuclear deal with world powers, which limits its enrichment of uranium in exchange for the lifting of some international sanctions, specifically allowed for the purchase of aircraft and parts. That's set off a race between airplane manufacturers for the newly opened market, home to 80 million people. Airbus' announcements will be closely watched by Boeing, which has its own deal on the line. In a June letter to the U.S. Congress, Boeing said the deal involves Iran Air buying 80 aircraft with a total list price of $17.6 billion, with deliveries beginning in 2017 and running until 2025. Iran Air also will lease 29 new Boeing 737s. Iran also has ordered 20 airplanes from French-Italian aircraft manufacturer ATR. In a statement, Boeing spokesman Marc Sklar said his company believed Airbus applied for its license before it did and that the U.S. government "follows a first-in, first-out policy." "We look forward to receiving our license from the government shortly," he said. However, the Boeing deal has been criticized by American lawmakers over Iran's "pernicious behavior," including launching ballistic missiles, firing rockets near U.S. warships in the strategic Strait of Hormuz and briefly detaining American sailors who strayed into its territorial waters. The U.S. presidential election could also have an effect on the sales. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has threatened to tear up the nuclear deal if elected this November.

"We have received that license and remain in talks with Iran Air based on the MOA [Memorandum of Agreement]," Boeing said. "Any final sales agreement would have to adhere to the license we’ve been issued." In March, the US Department of the Treasury announced that the United States has issued a general license authorizing US persons to enter into contacts to sell commercial passenger aircrafts, parts and services to Iran. In February, Boeing received a license from the US government to begin talks with Iranian airlines after nuclear-related sanctions against Tehran were lifted in January. In June, Boeing reached a Memorandum of Agreement with Iran Air on jets sales and applied for the US government license that would allow the company to complete the deal. Iran reached a nuclear agreement with the P5+1 group of countries, among which the United States, to maintain the peaceful nature of its nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief. ...

Boeing and Airbus have been given the green light by the U.S. government to sell planes to Iran despite fierce political opposition to the deal. The Treasury Department has approved the delivery of more than 100 Boeing aircraft and 17 Airbus passenger planes, marking a key step for Iran’s foreign business dealings now that its economic sanctions are lifted. Boeing is a U.S. company headquartered in Chicago. Airbus, a European consortium, needed U.S. government approval to sell aircraft to Iran because many parts are made in the U.S. and the American authorities want to ensure the country doesn’t use the planes for military purposes. Treasury said in a statement Wednesday that the licenses “contain strict conditions to ensure that the planes will be used exclusively for commercial passenger use and cannot be resold or transferred.” The Treasury’s decision means Boeing has permission to deliver 80 jetliners that Iran agreed to buy in June. The license also covers 29 Boeing aircraft the company will “help Iran Air find” from leasing companies, the manufacturer said. Airbus signed a deal in January, agreeing to provide 118 planes to Iran for about $26 billion. This is among its biggest ever sales, and includes 12 A380 super jumbo jets. Airbus expects the U.S. government to approve the sale of the remaining 101 planes in the next few weeks, Airbus spokesperson Justin Dubon told CNNMoney. Iran is working to modernize a fleet that is among the oldest and most dangerous in the world. Years of sanctions left Iran’s airlines with outdated and unsafe aircraft. The sanctions were lifted after Iran agreed to curtail its nuclear program. Many sanctions against Iran still remain. For example, the U.S. continues to block companies from doing business with Iran in U.S. dollars. This has complicated the financing of these huge plane contracts, since many banks are concerned about working with Iran. Several big banks, including HSBC and BNP Paribas, were fined billions of dollars for dealing with Iran while more extensive U.S. sanctions were in place. Airbus said it believed financing wouldn’t be a problem. “There are institutions out there that could do it,” said Dubon. “There is liquidity in the market and there are several avenues [we can pursue]. Even if there’s reticence by some banks.” U.S. approval could provide welcome relief for the struggling A380 super jumbo, which cost Airbus $25 billion to develop. Sales have been disappointing and the company recently slashed its production outlook for the plane due to a lack of customers. Can Magic Bus double incomes of slum dwellers?

The aerospace group said it remained in talks with Iran Air on a final sales agreement after the two sides reached a preliminary deal in June. The deal is valued at as much as $25 billion. "Any final sales agreement would have to adhere to the license we've been issued," said Boeing spokesman Mark Sklar. Founded in 1916 in Seattle by William Boeing as the Pacific Aero Products Co., Boeing has evolved into the biggest exporter in the United States ©Paul J. Richards (AFP/File) The June memorandum of understanding covered the sale of 80 planes to Iran Air. Boeing will also lease 29 other planes to Iranian national carrier under the deal. Additional sales would require another license, said a person familiar with the matter. Earlier Wednesday, Airbus announced that it obtained a first licence from the United States to supply passenger jets to Iran, a key step towards fulfilling a multi-billion-dollar deal of its own. Iran had been an international pariah prior to the nuclear deal reached last year with world powers and the US-Iran relationship remains one of mutual distrust, with the US maintaining extensive sanctions on the Islamic republic. Boeing's deal with Iran drew scorn from some on Capitol Hill. Lawmakers on a panel in the House of Representatives enacted a measure to block the sales, but it did not win support in the full Congress.

The aerospace group said it remained in talks with Iran Air on a final sales agreement after the two sides reached a preliminary deal in June. The deal is valued at as much as $25 billion. "Any final sales agreement would have to adhere to the license we've been issued," said Boeing spokesman Mark Sklar. The June memorandum of understanding covered the sale of 80 planes to Iran Air. Boeing will also lease 29 other planes to Iranian national carrier under the deal. Additional sales would require another license, said a person familiar with the matter. Earlier Wednesday, Airbus announced that it obtained a first licence from the United States to supply passenger jets to Iran, a key step towards fulfilling a multi-billion-dollar deal of its own. Iran had been an international pariah prior to the nuclear deal reached last year with world powers and the US-Iran relationship remains one of mutual distrust, with the US maintaining extensive sanctions on the Islamic republic. Boeing's deal with Iran drew scorn from some on Capitol Hill. Lawmakers on a panel in the House of Representatives enacted a measure to block the sales, but it did not win support in the full Congress.

The green light allows the Chicago-based plane maker to conclude sales of more than 100 planes that were outlined in a memorandum of agreement it reached with Iran Air in June, Boeing said. "We have received that license and remain in talks with Iran Air based on the MOA," Boeing said in a statement. "Any final sales agreement would have to adhere to the license we've been issued."

Iran News ... 09/21/16 Mark Kirk's Surprising Disinterest In Boeing's Iran Sales By Eli Clifton (source: LobeLog) Sen. Mark Kirk (R-IL) opposes pretty much anything that might take the pressure off Iran. He called Obama the “drug dealer in chief” for delivering $400 million in cash to the Islamic Republic as part of a settlement for money owed to Iran since 1979. He has gone so far as to say that “it’s okay to take food out of the mouths” of the Iranian people to punish their government for its behavior. And he opposed the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) to curtail Iran’s nuclear program in exchange for international sanctions relief, declaring it the “greatest appeasement since Chamberlain gave Czechoslovakia to Hitler.” But Kirk’s immediate political interests appear to outweigh his hostility to Iran, and its population, when it comes to a potential $25 billion purchase of Boeing passenger aircraft by Iran Air. Boeing is based is based in Illinois, the state Kirk represents and where he is fighting a tough reelection against Rep. Tammy Duckworth (D-IL). It is the third largest public company (by market capitalization) in the state. Kirk’s only public comment on the potential deal came last month, when he acknowledged that his desire for jobs in his state competes with his distrust of Iran. In June, he told Reuters’ Patricia Zengerle, “You want the jobs, but you are worried about what the Iranians are going to do with the aircraft.” Kirk’s spokesperson did not respond for requests for clarification about the senator’s position on the potential sale of Boeing aircraft. But other Republicans haven’t stayed as quiet as Kirk. “American companies should not be complicit in weaponizing the Iranian Regime,” Reps. Jeb Hensarling (R-TX) and Peter Roskam (R-IL) said in a letter to Boeing in June. Tim Keating, Boeing’s senior vice president of government relations, responded to Hensarling and Roskam, writing, “Boeing negotiated the MOA under the authority of the U.S. government following its determination that Iran had met its obligations under the (nuclear agreement).” Opponents of the deal have expressed concern that Iran may use the planes to ferry arms and other supplies to bolster Syrian President Bashar al-Assad or to Hezbollah. The lifting of sanctions against Iran’s aviation sector following the adoption of the JCPOA leaves Boeing free to negotiate a sale with Iran. House Republicans, however, have made efforts to scuttle the deal, and an advocacy campaign from Iran hawks opposed to JCPOA has sought to pressure companies from doing business with Iran. Kirk’s unwillingness to take sides against the sale might be an example of the hawkish senator’s electoral needs outweighing his animosity toward Tehran and his dependence on hawkish pro-Israel funding. Donors affiliated with NorPAC, a PAC associated with AIPAC, which led opposition to the Iran nuclear deal, are Kirk’s top campaign contributors. A super PAC called Independent Voice for Illinois has raised $1.6 million, largely from out-of-state Republican donors, including $250,000 from hedge fund billionaire and anti-Iran deal donor Paul Singer, and appears to be exclusively focusing its spending on ads supporting Kirk’s reelection.

The Treasury is expected to start approving sales of Boeing jets within days, ISNA news agency reported Sept. 21. Sources also quoted a spokesman for Airbus as having said the company had received a US license covering a total of 17 aircraft slated for early delivery. Although based in Europe, Airbus needs US approval because some parts of the jets are made in the US. Iran and Airbus agreed over the purchase of 118 aircraft back in January. Iran reached another agreement with Boeing in June. But it was later announced that a deal would be possible to carry out only after it was permitted by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), a subsidiary of the US Treasury. The mere prospects of the deals have benefited the two companies. Shortly after the agreements with Iran were made, the value of Boeing’s shares on the stock market jumped meaningfully. Also seeing the positive impact, Airbus increased its prices by about 1.1 percent, with the result that its most economical aircraft, the A318, was priced $1.75 million. Tehran wants to buy up to 500 aircraft over the next decade to rejuvenate its aging fleet. The Airbus and Boeing deals’ push-through will find large political implications in Iran as well. The government has been under a lot of domestic pressure after its January nuclear deal with world powers. Right-wing activists say the deal has changed nothing because Iran is still unable to carry out international business transactions even after nuclear-related sanctions on Iran have been removed. If he manages to materialize the Airbus deal, President Hassan Rouhani will have delivered his critics a hard blow, especially as Iran is preparing for another round of presidential election in mid-2017 when Rouhani is expected to run for a second term.

"We understand that the U.S. government has issued Airbus a license to sell aircraft to Iran," Chicago-based Boeing said in a statement. "We believe their license application was submitted prior to our similar request and that the government follows a 'first in, first out' policy. We look forward to receiving our license from the government shortly." Sales to Iran would provide an important boost to the order books of Boeing and Airbus during a year when sales have slowed. Iran has said it needs 400 planes to rebuild its commercial aircraft fleet after decades of isolation. Boeing and Airbus have reached provisional agreements to sell more than 100 jetliners each to Iran's national airline, a pair of deals valued at more than $50 billion at list prices. The sales follow a landmark agreement on Iran's nuclear program last year. Airbus Group shares were up 0.74 percent at 52.86 euros. Boeing shares were up 0.9 percent at $128.96. The sales still face obstacles from bankers, who are cautious because U.S. banks remain barred from doing business with Iran.

Boeing has chosen Rockwell Collins to develop the world's first touch-screen technology for commercial pilots on its new 777X. Courtesy / Boeing Boeing 777X set to become world’s first flying iPad Bloomberg September 21, 2016 Updated: September 21, 2016 07:38 PM Related Multi-plane Boeing 747 order from UPS may be jumbo jet’s last hurrah For economy-seat airline passengers, cattle class may soon be just a bad memory GCC gains from French high-tech diving experience Tensions spur rise in arms deals for navies Airline industry’s profits take wing on low oil prices Topics: Boeing Pilots on Boeing’s 777X jetliner will soon be able to use a swipe of the finger to plot a course around a threatening storm or check an engine’s maintenance history. The Chicago-based plane maker has chosen Rockwell Collins to provide the first touchscreen monitors to be installed in a commercial aircraft. When Boeing’s largest twin-engine plane debuts in 2020, pilots will hone in on flight data on the jet’s five displays with a pinch-to-zoom motion – much like Apple’s iPad has brought a world of information to consumers. Rockwell Collins is counting on the screens and the data flowing through them to boost sales and improve pilots’ situational awareness as modern planes turn into flying file servers. The touchscreens are also designed to make flight displays more intuitive while shaving weight from airframes. "Airplanes were one of the last places that were disconnected, but no longer," said the Rockwell Collins chief executive Kelly Ortberg. "It’s happening to all of us in the mobile world. You could see it was going to sweep our world as well." Rockwell Collins stock has dropped 11 per cent this year through Tuesday as tepid business-jet sales and a slow rebound in US government spending held back earnings. The aerospace manufacturer is counting on a late-decade pay-off from contract wins to install large flight displays and other electronic systems on Boeing’s next-generation aircraft, from the 787 Dreamliner to the 737 Max. Honeywell International, Thales and Garmin are also competing for supremacy to bring new innovations to pilots’ fingertips. They face a common rival in the iPad itself and ecosystems of developers catering to recreational pilots. ForeFlight, for example, has developed maps and "synthetic vision" to help to steer around hazardous terrain with a tap of an Apple or Android tablet hooked into a plane’s GPS and ADS-B tracking systems. The new Rockwell Collins products are the culmination of a strategy plotted by then-chief executive Clay Jones and Mr Ortberg early last decade, when smartphones and tablets were in their infancy. Following a painful defence contract loss, the manufacturer adopted a flexible "open" architecture for its systems to win over customers such as Boeing. Its US$1.39 billion acquisition of Arinc in 2013, just 11 days after Mr Ortberg took the helm, was the company’s largest and provided new ways to pipe data into aeroplanes. While Rockwell Collins is scouting smaller deals, Mr Ortberg is open to another bold move as he charts a course toward a world of smart planes and connected pilots. "If another Arinc came along, I’d love to be in a position to do that," he said. "We’re keeping our credit rating at investment grade so we have the financial capability to do that."

These are in addition to the 42 Boeing B737 MAX8 planes that it had ordered earlier. | TNN | Sep 21, 2016, 06.42 AM IST KOLKATA: SpiceJet, the airline that came back from the dead, is set to order more than 100 new planes in the next couple of months. These are in addition to the 42 Boeing B737 MAX8 planes that it had ordered earlier. SpiceJet chairman and managing director Ajay Singh said the airline was in the final round of talks with aircraft majors Boeing and Airbus for nar row-body planes and other manufacturers for smaller regional aircraft. "The airline is ready for expansion and requires more aircraft. We will place the order for more than 100 planes in October or November," he said. The prospect of the order worth over $12 billion (Rs 80,000 crore) comes less than two years after the airline's fortune crashed on December 17, 2014.With mounting losses and not enough operational capital at hand, the management announced suspension of all flights from 4pm that day . Many thought the airli ne was going the Kingfisher way . It was perilously close to it because no airline in the world has returned after stopping operations," Ajay Singh said.Singh who had originally owned the airline before selling it to the Sun group, bought the airline back and revived it by focusing on the business, cutting costs and overheads and rejigging the network. "From being in the red, the airline was back in black from the very first quarter after the takeover. Last year, we posted a profit of Rs 500 crore.The airline has made profits in the past six quarters. In the first quarter this fiscal, we have posted Rs 150 crore profit, nearly double that of last year. We are now ready for expansion and will focus on adding frequencies. Hence, the requirement for more aircraft," he said. SpiceJet has a fleet of 26 Boeing 737 aircraft and 14 Bombardier Q-400 aircraft. While SpiceJet has only B737-800 aircraft in the narrow body segment, Singh said he is open to Airbus A320 aircraft if he gets a good deal from the European manufacturer. Indigo Airlines, AirAsia India and Vistara have an all-Airbus fleet while SpiceJet and Jet Airways has Boeing planes. Air India has both Boeing and Airbus planes. Singh said the airline would look at both B737 and A320 and their extended version to service both domestic and international market within a flying range of 4-5 hours. "We don't intend to fly long-haul in the near future.Instead, we will stick to short-haul flights covering the Indian sub-continent and extending to West and SouthEast Asia," he said.

Quoting “significantly lower proposed prices” for initial production, the agency found Boeing would be hard-pressed to match Northrop’s bid to work on the $80 billion stealth-bomber program. Boeing has slammed the GAO’s analysis as flawed. Keep reading for the whole story with recent events put in context B-52H, B-1B & B-2A (click to view full) The good news? 2006 saw a convergence of opinion within the USAF that a new long-range strike platform was needed. This is understandable given the B-52H Stratofortress fleet’s age (40-50 years), the B-1B Lancer’s internal power and electronics issues, both of these platforms’ low survivability against advanced air defense systems, and the B-2A Spirit stealth bomber’s very small numbers (21, of which 7-12 are generally operational). The unmanned J-UCAS program, meanwhile was seen as having inadequate range and payload (Boeing X-45C: 1,400 mile radius with 8 GBU-39 Small Diameter Bombs). The USAF decided that J-UCAS wasn’t a solution and pulled out, stalling American UCAV development until the Navy chose to go ahead with the carrier-based N-UCAS. The bad news? They seemed to have little idea of exactly what they wanted in their bomber. The FY 2010 budget killed those plans anyway, but in September 2010, pressure to field a new bomber began to rise again. By the time fiscal year 2015 budget planning was in motion, both DoD and the Air Force seemed committed to making the program one of the service’s top 3 priorities. Advertisement Bad News, Good News FB-22: out (click to view full) BAD NEWS: Officials disagreed on what kind of aircraft or missile should be designed to meet the requirement. A single plane? A missile? A family of aircraft? Manned or unmanned? A fighter-bomber like the FB-22/FB-23 idea to fill the FB-111’s vacant shoes, or a full-reach heavy bomber? A traditional land-based platform, or should it be carrier capable? Something comparable to the $2 billion B-2s to take on the toughest strike missions – or more of a utility aircraft like some of the “arsenal aircraft” proposals, aimed at replacing the B-52s with a platform based on a passenger jet or C-17 that would be more economical to fly and maintain? And where do proposals to simply re-engine the B-52 fleet fit in? Until (unless) this was sorted out, R&D efforts could not succeed – and issues of future force structure remained open questions. An official Analysis of Alternatives was scheduled for Spring 2007, and the articles below chronicle developments in that process as it works its way forward. At this point, it appears certain that the new bomber will fly at subsonic speeds, and incorporate modern advances in stealth technology. Other elements are less clear. THE GOOD NEWS? Key technologies, from stealth to control of unmanned combat aircraft, have taken many steps forward since this discussion began. In September 2006, Inside Defense reported that the US Air Force was responding to ongoing Congressional pressure with a proposed $5 billion initial investment over the next few years. Their goal was to develop a next-generation long-range strike platform by 2018, with a fly-off before final platform selection. All of this work was effectively brought to a halt when US Secretary of Defense Robert M. Gates announced his FY 2010 budget recommendations, and effectively suspended the competition. Research may continue in some related technologies under ‘black’ (non-public) budgets, but Sec 124 of the Senate’s S.1390 FY 2010 defense budget was clear: “On May 7, 2009, President Barack Obama announced the termination of the next generation bomber aircraft program in the document of the Office of Management and Budget entitled ‘Terminations, Reductions, and Savings,’ stating that ‘there is no urgent need to begin an expensive development program for a new bomber’ and that ‘the future bomber fleet may not be affordable over the next six years’.” By 2010, however, pressure began to rise again to field a new bomber. The breakthrough came, ironically, during a January 2011 speech about $150 billion in spending and program reductions: “Finally, a major area of investment for the Air Force will be a new long-range, nuclear-capable penetrating bomber. This aircraft – which will have the option of being piloted remotely – will be designed and developed using proven technologies, an approach that should make it possible to deliver this capability on schedule and in quantity. It is important that we begin this project now to ensure that a new bomber can be ready before the current aging fleet goes out of service. The follow on bomber represents a key component of a joint portfolio of conventional deep-strike capabilities – an area that should be a high priority for future defense investment given the anti-access challenges our military faces.” Competing Teams Phantom Ray rollout (click to view larger) On the contractor side, the program seemed to be shaping clearly, the picture has become muddy again. On Jan 25/08, Boeing and Lockheed Martin announced that they would be cooperating on a bid of their own. Their team will perform studies and system development efforts “in pursuit of the anticipated U.S. Air Force Next Generation Bomber program.” Their collaborative research and development efforts will include will include work in advanced sensors, future electronic warfare solutions, better networked awareness of the broader battlefield, command and control issues for stealth platforms, and virtual warfare simulation and experimentation. By March 2010, however, the joint team members were each going their own way. Boeing’s X-45C Phantom Ray provides them with a very useful test platform that could become a base for a new unmanned bomber, and Lockheed Martin’s own work on “black program” UAVs gives them growing expertise as well. They eventually got back together in 2013, once requirements began to clarify. Northrop Grumman is another obvious contender, as the designer and manufacturer of the B-2A Spirit Stealth bomber. The firm has moved away from designing full-scale manned military aircraft in recent years, but there are persistent rumors of black (secret) program contracts related to the design of a next-generation bomber, and NGC’s leadership has indicated that black programs are a growing strategic focus for the company. Taken in tandem, it seems likely that Northrop Grumman is already working on a next-generation stealth bomber design. CFO James Palmer admitted as much during a financial conference in November 2013. Update October 27/16: While heavily redacted, the US Government Accountability Office (GAO) has published a 52-page ruling on Boeing’s protest of the B-21 competition won by Northrop Grumman. Quoting “significantly lower proposed prices” for initial production, the agency found Boeing would be hard-pressed to match Northrop’s bid to work on the $80 billion stealth-bomber program. Boeing has slammed the GAO’s analysis as flawed. September 21/16: The USAF’s new long-range strike bomber has officially been named the B-21 Raider. Air Force Secretary Deborah Lee James made the announcement on Monday in what is a tribute to the legacy of WW2’s Doolittle Raiders rather than a reference to the Indiana Jones movie “Raiders of the Lost Ark.” The Doolittle Raiders are known for their surprise attack against Japan during on April 18, 1942, which forced the Japanese to recall combat forces for home defense, and boosted morale among Americans and US allies abroad. September 4/15: Northrop Grumman and competitor coalition Lockheed Martin and Boeing submitted designs for the new long range bomber, with a decision expected in October. The first versions produced are expected to be manned craft, with unmanned craft coming a few years later. Designs are said to be more detailed at the stage than is typical.

Iran News ... 09/20/16 First Boeing Jet Joins Iran's Naft Airline: Report Source: Press TV Iranian Naft Airlines, a homebound charter airline providing passenger and cargo services to Iran's Ministry of Petroleum, says it has received the first Boeing jet. The aircraft, one of the four Boeing 737 single-aisle jetliners bought from the US aviation company, was delivered to Naft Airlines on Sunday, its Managing Director Nurollah Rezai Niyaraki said. Boeing 737 "After the JCPOA (Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action), an agreement was signed with the Boeing company for purchase of four 737s and today one of the ordered aircraft was delivered to Iranian Naft Airlines," he told Shana news agency. The aircraft took off at 1700 hours local time on its first flight from Tehran to Ahvaz on Sunday, the official said. "According to the timeline, the remaining three Boeing 737s will gradually join the Iranian Naft Airlines fleet at specific dates" by the end of the current Iranian year on March 20, 2017, Rezai Niyaraki added. Naft Airline Other Iranian media reports said the aircraft, with a capacity to carry up to 148 passengers, had been leased to Iran under the complete crew, maintenance, and insurance (ACMI) arrangement. The reports, however, did not clarify whether the aircraft was a brand new or used plane and whether it had been leased directly by Boeing or another airline. In June, Boeing signed a memorandum of agreement with Iran Air to sell a total of 80 aircraft and lease a further 29 to the company in a potential deal worth about $25 billion. The plan, however, faces stiff opposition in US Congress, raising doubts about deliveries of the jets that are scheduled to start in 2017 and run through 2025. On Monday, Deputy Minister of Roads and Transportation Asghar Fakhriyeh Kashan said Iran may take one aircraft off the provisional deal with Boeing as he criticized what Tehran sees as unfair delays in finalizing it. The tentative agreement awaits US Treasury Department's endorsement before being finalized. Under the nuclear deal, the Treasury Department will review on a case-by-case basis the licensing of individuals or entities that want to export, re-export, sell, lease or transfer to Iran commercial passenger aircraft, and associated parts and services. Naft Airlines appears to be the first Iranian company to have its deal cleared by the US Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC). Iranian airlines have some 60 Boeing airplanes in service, but most of them were purchased before the 1979 Islamic Revolution and are in a dire need of repair or retirement. ...

Large elements for NASA’s Space Launch System are in production and will be joined together to create the rocket’s 212-foot-tall core stage, the backbone of the SLS rocket. Why is NASA building the world’s most powerful rocket? Because SLS is ready to support both near-term missions in the proving ground around the moon starting in 2018, while at the same time being capable of carrying the very large hardware like landers, habitats and other supplies and equipment needed to explore Mars and other deep space destinations in the 2030s and beyond. Engineers just completed welding the liquid hydrogen tank that will provide fuel for the first SLS flight in 2018. The tank measures more than 130 feet tall, comprises almost two-thirds of the core stage and holds 537,000 gallons of liquid hydrogen — which is cooled to minus 423 degrees Fahrenheit. (NASA/Michoud/Steven Seipel) To power a Mars rocket, the core stage carries around 2.3 million pounds of liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen to fuel the four RS-25 engines. Engineers just completed welding the largest part of the core stage, the 130-foot-tall liquid hydrogen tank that will provide fuel for the first SLS flight in 2018, but there’s still work to ready the tank for its maiden voyage. “Building the core stage is similar to building a house,” said Joan Funk, SLS core stage lead at NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama. “With the massive, welded elements coming off the Vertical Assembly Center at Michoud, we’ve laid the foundation, framed the walls and put up the roof. The big items are in place. Now it’s time to get to work on the inside.” That’s where engineers will clean and prime each element before beginning the internal integration. Michoud’s Vertical Assembly Center, the largest spacecraft-welding tool in the world, is welding many of the core stage’s main elements — the forward skirt, the liquid oxygen tank, the liquid hydrogen tank and the engine section. The core stage’s fifth element, the intertank, which is bolted, is also being built at Michoud. The Boeing Company, headquartered in Chicago, is the prime contractor building the core stage, but to build the stage, Boeing has worked with 442 businesses across America, including 297 small businesses. “When welding is complete, these structures still have to go through more processing to turn them into functional parts of the rocket,” said Funk. “The core stage has parts with very different functions from housing the flight computer and primary avionics to holding the fuel to supporting the four RS-25 engines.” The final manufacturing processes and outfitting for each part of the core stage varies with the section’s function. Wet structures — elements that hold fuel, or the liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen tanks — are put through “proof tests” to assure manufacturing quality. The liquid oxygen tank is hydrostatically tested and filled with water; and the liquid hydrogen tank is pneumatically tested. After testing, the tanks and dry structures — elements that don’t hold fuel, or the forward skirt, intertank and engine section — are cleaned, primed and readied for the “work on the inside.” Much like a house being constructed, the core stage is outfitted with wiring, plumbing and insulation. The dry structures house flight computers, cameras and avionics — or the “brains” of the rocket. In a house, wiring can carry power or television and internet data from room to room. In the SLS’s core stage, 45 miles of wire cabling serves a similar purpose, carrying power and data from element to element powering flight computers, cameras, sensors, avionics and other electronics housed in the dry structures. The core stage’s plumbing contains lines that deliver the propellant and oxidizer from the tanks to the engines. Each dry structure also contains purge vent lines and hazardous gas lines designed to eliminate dangerous gases building up in the dry structures prior to launch. Where the rubber meets the road, the engine section is the business end of the core stage. It houses the four RS-25 engines — formerly space shuttle main engines, the most reliable rocket engines ever built — that produce more than 2 million pounds of thrust during launch. The engine section also houses the avionics used to steer the engines and is an attachment point for the solid rocket boosters. (NASA/Michoud/Steven Seipel) “The dry structures are cram-packed full of equipment and the domes of the tanks take up a lot of the room inside the dry structures,” said Funk. Racks, cameras, sensors, vent lines, wire cabling, valves, shelves, couplings, and more fill the core stage’s dry structures to near capacity. With every inch planned, equipment is mounted and wiring is placed methodically, accounting for time, space, accessibility and much more. When the dry structures are ready to be “stacked,” or joined to the other elements, there isn’t much room to spare. Before the elements can be stacked, insulation — which is more important to a rocket than to a house — is applied. Not only does NASA’s thermal protection system give the rocket its signature orange color, but more importantly, it protects the core stage from the extreme temperatures encountered during launch and maintains the fuels’ extremely low temperatures. The liquid hydrogen is chilled to minus 423 degrees Fahrenheit and the liquid oxygen is chilled to minus 297 degrees. How do those elements finally come together to form the 212-foot-long core stage? With the initial wiring, plumbing and insulation complete, the elements are divided into two sections for stacking. Each section is stacked vertically, with elements bolted to one another using segmented support rings welded to each element, providing stiffness. The liquid hydrogen tank sits atop the engine section to create the aft section, and the forward skirt and intertank are bolted to the top and bottom of the liquid oxygen tank to create the forward section. When complete, engineers “break over” the sections, or move them to a horizontal position, for their final assembly. Final wiring, plumbing and insulation are installed after the forward section is joined to the aft to complete the core stage assembly. Ratana Meekham, a Qualis Corp. engineering technician at NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center, helps install approximately 5 miles of cable on a half-ring structure being used to test the avionics system that will guide the SLS. The forward skirt, intertank and engine section contain the rocket’s avionics and electronics. (NASA/MSFC/Fred Deaton) Before punching its ticket to launch, the core stage will travel by barge to NASA’s Stennis Space Center near Bay St. Louis, Mississippi, where it will undergo a free modal test to understand the structure then be mounted in the recently renovated B-2 Test Stand for propellant fill and drain testing and hot fire testing called a “green run.” A green run, or the first time the engines are assembled into a single configuration with the core stage and fired at nearly full-power, tests the compatibility and functionality of the system to ensure a safe and viable design. Once post-test assessments and adjustments are complete, the core stage will travel again by barge to NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida, for its first flight with Orion.

The breakthrough towards developing commercially viable low carbon fuel is the result of a partnership between Virgin Atlantic and LanzaTech. Since 2011 they have been committed to producing the world’s first jet fuel derived from waste industrial gases from steel mills via a fermentation process. The Lanzanol was produced in China at the RSB (Roundtable of Sustainable Biomaterials) certified Shougang demonstration facility. The innovative alcohol-to-jet (AtJ) process was developed in collaboration with Pacific Northwest National Lab (PNNL) with support from the US Department of Energy (DOE) and with the help of funding from HSBC. LanzaTech and Virgin Atlantic are now set to continue to work with Boeing and a host of industry colleagues to complete the additional testing aircraft and engine manufacturers require before approving the fuel for first use in a commercial aircraft.  Assuming all initial approvals are achieved, the innovative LanzaTech jet fuel could be used in a first of its kind proving flight in 2017. Following a successful ‘proving flight’ the data collected will enable the partnership to seek approval to use the fuel on routine commercial flights.  This would also help pave the way for LanzaTech to fund and build their first commercial jet fuel plant to supply fuel to Virgin Atlantic and other airlines.  As a UK based partnership it is hoped the first LanzaTech jet fuel plant would be based in the UK. Sir Richard Branson said: “This is a real game changer for aviation and could significantly reduce the industry’s reliance on oil within our lifetime. Virgin Atlantic was the first commercial airline to test a bio-fuel flight and continues to be a leader in sustainable aviation. “We chose to partner with LanzaTech because of its impressive sustainability profile and the commercial potential of the jet fuel.  Our understanding of low carbon fuels has developed rapidly over the last decade, and we are closer than ever before to bringing a sustainable product to the market for commercial use by Virgin Atlantic and other global airlines.” Dr Jennifer Holmgren, Chief Executive of LanzaTech, said: “We can now truly imagine a world where a steel mill can not only produce the steel for the components of the plane but also recycle its gases to produce the fuel that powers the aircraft.  This program illustrates that such breakthroughs are only possible through collaboration.  In this case, it is governments (US DOE, FAA, DARPA), laboratories (PNNL, AFRL, SWRI, MTU, UDRI), NGOs (RSB) and industry (Virgin, HSBC, Boeing, Shougang, Airlines for America) coming together to disrupt our current global carbon trajectory. “We look forward to working with colleagues past, present and future to make this pioneering new fuel a commercial reality. “   The LanzaTech production process explained Steel production produces waste carbon monoxide (CO) gas, which is frequently flared (burnt off) to the atmosphere as greenhouse gas CO2 (or sometimes used less efficiently for other purposes). The LanzaTech process involves capturing carbon from the waste gas via fermentation to ethanol, which is recovered to produce ethanol feedstock for a variety of products, including aviation fuel. Each gallon of ethanol is converted to produce 1/2 gallon of aviation fuel. The process could be used to capture and recycle around 1/3 of the carbon that steel facilities would otherwise release into the atmosphere. Future potential of this technology Ground energy can be sourced carbon free – think solar or wind – but to make liquid fuels as per those needed for aviation you need a carbon source. Where this carbon comes from is up to us – new fossil resources, or recycled carbon. Recycling waste carbon streams is an effective way to keep fossil resources in the ground. Worldwide, around 1.7 billion metric tonnes of steel is produced every year and waste gases are produced through the chemistry of steel making. LanzaTech estimates that its process could be retrofitted to 65% of the world’s steel mills. This offers the potential to produce 30 billion gallons of ethanol worldwide, for around 15 billion gallons of jet fuel p.a. This would represent just under 19% of all aviation fuel currently used worldwide p.a. (80 billion gallon total world aviation fuel use).   About Virgin Atlantic Virgin Atlantic was founded by entrepreneur Sir Richard Branson over 30 years ago after he decided the UK aviation industry needed shaking up and style injected back into it. On 22nd June 1984, Virgin Atlantic’s inaugural flight to Newark took place, on an aircraft filled with personal friends, celebrities and the media. Today, Virgin Atlantic flies to over 30 destinations worldwide, including locations across the United States, the Caribbean, Africa, the Middle East and Asia. Virgin Atlantic has been active in the sustainable aviation space for many years.  Its Change is in the Air sustainability programme was established in 2007. Sustainable jet fuels are a key part of that programme’s carbon reduction focus.  For full information about Change is in the Air visit: www.virgin-atlantic.com/changeisintheair. Virgin Atlantic formally partnered with LanzaTech on its low carbon jet fuel in 2011.  The two companies have been working hard behind the scenes to progress the programme since then.  HSBC joined the partnership in 2014. About HSBC HSBC has been involved in the LanzaTech partnership since 2014. HSBC has shown commitment to projects that accelerate the shift to a low-carbon economy, reflecting its commitment to work with suppliers and customers alike to help address climate change.   Statements of support Antonio Simoes, CEO of HSBC Bank plc, said: “We are proud to have provided support and funding to allow production of this innovative new fuel to move from sample size to small demo scale. This breakthrough is testament to what can be achieved when different industries work together to address climate change and support the shift to a low-carbon economy.” Mr. Wang Tao, Chairman of the Beijing Shougang LanzaTech New Energy Technology Co. Ltd. said: “Our partnership with LanzaTech symbolizes Shougang’s desire to create a sustainable future for China where industrial growth and environmental benefits go hand in hand,” “Ethanol made from recycled carbon in China can now be used to fuel a plane in the United Kingdom, using technology from the United States! We are honoured to be part of this truly global partnership to provide new sustainable pathways for low carbon fuels that do not impact the food chain or land use.” Julie-Ann Felgar, Managing Director of Environmental Strategy at Boeing Commercial Airplanes said: “Boeing is proud to work with Virgin Atlantic and LanzaTech to further expand the use of sustainable alternative aviation fuel. Our work with Virgin Atlantic over many years to move the needle on identifying technologies and partnerships, such as this effort with LanzaTech, reflects the innovative spirit and deep commitment of our industry to reduce our CO2 footprint.” Barbara Bramble, Vice President for International Conservation and Corporate Strategies, at the National Wildlife Federation (NWF) said: “Safeguarding wildlife and habitat in the face of climate change is one of the biggest challenges of our time. Technologies that reduce carbon emissions in transportation while meeting broader sustainability objectives can help to avoid the worst impacts of climate change on our wildlife and the habitats they call home. The progress announced today on a new pathway to sustainable aviation fuel is tremendously exciting, and National Wildlife Federation congratulates the global team, led by Virgin Atlantic, who has worked to make this a reality.” Rolf Hogan, Executive Director of the Roundtable on Sustainable Biomaterials (RSB) said: “RSB provides sustainability solutions for any biomaterial anywhere in the world and is the highest rated global system for biofuels. Congratulations to Virgin Atlantic for being a true leader and innovator in this space, and for keeping sustainability at the forefront of their business. It is exciting to be part of the process that delivered sustainable and RSB certified ethanol for conversion to aviation fuel for Virgin Atlantic. We look forward to seeing many more examples like this across the world so that aviation can become a more sustainable form of transportation.” Peter Bakker, President of the World Business Council for Sustainable Development said: “LanzaTech and Virgin Atlantic are demonstrating exactly the kind of innovative business leadership that the post-Paris world urgently needs.  Congratulations to both companies for their ongoing commitment to developing this breakthrough product. Under the below50 initiative we look forward to more ground-breaking collaborations between investors, producers and consumers that will help to scale-up solutions to decarbonize the transport sector.” John Holladay, Manager, Transportation Sector at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory said: “What this team is doing, capturing industrial waste gas- which can contain high levels of carbon monoxide gas- and turning it into jet fuel is almost magical. Our long term dream is making fuels and chemicals through recycling carbon. PNNL is proud to be involved with the project through bringing catalyst technology that builds on LanzaTech’s fermentation technology and we look forward to seeing the technology powering jets in the near future.” Source: Lanzatech and Virgin Atlantic, joint press release, 2016-09-14.

By RobertWall DougCameron The U.S. government has given plane makers Boeing Co. and Airbus Group SE the all-clear to deliver jetliners to Iran Air in one of the highest-profile trade breakthroughs since nuclear sanctions were lifted on the Islamic Republic in January. Western powers removed sanctions on Iran in return for the country agreeing to constrain its nuclear program. Business has been slow to materialize, though, amid concern among western businesses of running afoul of continued U.S. restrictions on doing business with Iran. Airbus AIR, -0.61%  , which was first to secure a plane deal with Iran, was first to receive the green light to transfer 17 planes to Iran Air, signaling the tide may be turning for doing business with Iran. Hours later Boeing BA, +0.47%  , the world’s largest plane maker by deliveries, said it too had received its corresponding license. Airbus on Wednesday said some of those deliveries may occur as early as this year, a spokesman said. Boeing aims to sell 80 jets directly to Iran Air as part of a proposed deal valued at up to $17.6 billion. It would be among the largest by a U.S. firm since the sanctions were loosened. Boeing said Wednesday it remained in talks with Iran Air about an existing tentative deal on plane purchases. An expanded version of this report appears on WSJ.com.

Credit: Matt Mills McKnight/Reuters Boeing said Wednesday it obtained a US government license to complete a sale of planes to Iran Air, moving closer to the first such deal since the 1979 Islamic revolution. The aerospace group said it remained in talks with Iran Air on a final sales agreement after the two sides reached a preliminary deal in June. The deal is valued at as much as $25 billion. "Any final sales agreement would have to adhere to the license we've been issued," said Boeing spokesman Mark Sklar. The June memorandum of understanding covered the sale of 80 planes to Iran Air. Boeing will also lease 29 other planes to the Iranian national carrier under the deal.  Additional sales would require another license, said a person familiar with the matter. Earlier Wednesday, Airbus announced that it obtained a first licence from the United States to supply passenger jets to Iran, a key step toward fulfilling a multibillion-dollar deal of its own. Iran had been an international pariah prior to the nuclear deal reached last year with world powers and the US-Iran relationship remains one of mutual distrust, with the US maintaining extensive sanctions on the Islamic republic. Boeing's deal with Iran drew scorn from some on Capitol Hill. Lawmakers on a panel in the House of Representatives enacted a measure to block the sales, but it did not win support in the full Congress.

(AP Photo/Vahid Salemi, File) FILE -- In this March 2, 2008 file photo, two passenger planes of Iran's national air carrier, Iran Air, are parked at the Mehrabad Airport in Tehran, Iran.

Most Iranian planes were purchased before the 1979 Islamic Revolution that ousted Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi and brought Islamists to power. (AP Photo/Vahid Salemi, File) Share This Article ARTICLE PHOTO GALLERY (1) Dubai, United Arab Emirates • Airbus on Wednesday became the first airplane manufacturer to receive U.S. government permission to sell aircraft to Iran following last year's nuclear accord, getting final approval for a 17-plane sale that's part of a larger $25-billion deal. The European aviation company's announcement, coming as Iranian and U.S. leaders are in New York for the United Nations General Assembly, showed that the outgoing administration of President Barack Obama is honoring the economic terms of the pact. The next administration, however, may change that equation for Airbus and Chicago-based Boeing Co., which has its own $25-billion deal on the line with Iran that would be the biggest for an American company since the 1979 Islamic Revolution and U.S. Embassy takeover. VIDEOS TOP JOBS Though based abroad, Airbus needed the approval of the U.S. Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control for the deal as at least 10 percent of the manufacturer's components are of American origin. Airbus applied for two licenses to cover its deal with Iran to ensure the fast delivery of some of the aircraft, Airbus spokesman Justin Dubon told The Associated Press. The license announced Wednesday covers the first 17 planes involved in the deal, which will be A320s and A330s, he said. Dubon declined to offer a breakdown of how many of each model are involved in the initial sale, but said Airbus hoped to receive a second license allowing it to sell the remaining planes to Iran soon. Iran's U.N. mission did not respond to a request for comment Wednesday. State television referred to an AP report on the sale. In January, national carrier Iran Air signed agreements to buy 118 planes from Airbus, estimated to be worth some 22.8 billion euros ($25 billion). The deal included 21 A320ceos, 24 A320neos, 27 A330ceos, 18 A330neos, 16 A350-1000s and 12 double-decker A380s. On Sunday, Asghar Fakhrieh Kashan, a deputy transportation minister, told reporters that he expected U.S. permission for all aircraft purchases "by the end of September" and that several airplanes would arrive by mid-March. However, he also said Iran would cut the number of Airbus planes it would buy to 112, state TV reported. Base model A320s are listed at an average of $98 million, while A330s start at $231.5 million. That puts the value of the approved 17 aircraft in the first license around at least $1.8 billion and possibly much higher based on list prices, though buyers typically negotiate sizable discounts for bulk orders. Most Iranian planes were purchased before the Islamic Revolution that ousted Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi and brought Islamists to power. Out of Iran's 250 commercial planes, 162 were flying in June, while the rest were grounded due to lack of spare parts. Iran Air, whose website lists 43 airplanes in its fleet, says it has direct flights to over 30 international destinations, including London. Iran's nuclear deal with world powers, which limits its enrichment of uranium in exchange for the lifting of some international sanctions, specifically allowed for the purchase of aircraft and parts. That's set off a race between airplane manufacturers for the newly opened market, home to 80 million people. Airbus' announcements will be closely watched by Boeing, which has its own deal on the line. In a June letter to the U.S. Congress, Boeing said the deal involves Iran Air buying 80 aircraft with a total list price of $17.6 billion, with deliveries beginning in 2017 and running until 2025. Iran Air also will lease 29 new Boeing 737s. Iran also has ordered 20 airplanes from French-Italian aircraft manufacturer ATR. In a statement, Boeing spokesman Marc Sklar said his company believed Airbus applied for its license before it did and that the U.S. government "follows a first-in, first-out policy." "We look forward to receiving our license from the government shortly," he said. However, the Boeing deal has been criticized by American lawmakers over Iran's "pernicious behavior," including launching ballistic missiles, firing rockets near U.S. warships in the strategic Strait of Hormuz and briefly detaining American sailors who strayed into its territorial waters. The U.S. presidential election could also have an effect on the sales. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has threatened to tear up the nuclear deal if elected this November.   Share This Article ARTICLE PHOTO GALLERY VIEW PHOTO GALLERY JOIN THE DISCUSSION     Post a Comment POPULAR STORIES It's not easy being black at BYU, film shows Utah football: Hunter Dimick takes center stage for Utah's defense Utah lawmakers: Time to take 'training wheels' off booming solar industry, retire tax credit Garrison Keillor: Politics is not everything.

The green light allows the Chicago-based plane maker to conclude sales of more than 100 planes that were outlined in a memorandum of agreement it reached with Iran Air in June, Boeing said. "We have received that licence and remain in talks with Iran Air based on the MOA," Boeing said in a statement. "Any final sales agreement would have to adhere to the licence we've been issued."

"We understand that the U.S. government has issued Airbus a license to sell aircraft to Iran," Chicago-based Boeing said in a statement. "We believe their license application was submitted prior to our similar request and that the government follows a 'first in, first out' policy. We look forward to receiving our license from the government shortly." Sales to Iran would provide an important boost to the order books of Boeing and Airbus during a year when sales have slowed. Iran has said it needs 400 planes to rebuild its commercial aircraft fleet after decades of isolation. Boeing and Airbus have reached provisional agreements to sell more than 100 jetliners each to Iran's national airline, a pair of deals valued at more than $50 billion at list prices. The sales follow a landmark agreement on Iran's nuclear program last year. Airbus Group shares were up 0.74 percent at 52.86 euros. Boeing shares were up 0.9 percent at $128.96. The sales still face obstacles from bankers, who are cautious because U.S. banks remain barred from doing business with Iran.

The U.S. Treasury Department granted licenses to Boeing and Airbus Group SE on Wednesday for the first of a flurry of aircraft orders that Iran is counting on to upgrade an aging fleet. Airbus won approval to export the first 17 jets in a $27 billion transaction announced in January as economic sanctions were eased. Boeing is still finalizing terms to provide as many as 109 jets to Iran Air, the Chicago-based planemaker said in an e-mailed statement. “It removes some uncertainty,” Howard Rubel, an analyst at Jefferies, said of Boeing’s license. “It says that commerce is important and commerce builds bridges. It is also a pathfinder for other people that may want to do business with Iran over time.” Boeing’s last airplane deliveries to Iran consisted of 747 jumbos that arrived in 1977, two years before the revolution, according to the company’s website. The Islamic Republic’s flag carrier would add more of the iconic, humpbacked 747s, as well as 777 and upgraded 777X wide-body jets under a $17.6 billion order for 80 Boeing aircraft. The U.S. manufacturer is also helping Iran Air line up another 29 planes from leasing companies. “Any final sales agreement would have to adhere to the license we’ve been issued,” Mark Sklar, a spokesman for Boeing, said by e-mail. Vintage Fleet Boeing rose on the news, advancing 2.2 percent to $130.56 at the close in New York, tied for the biggest gain on the Dow Jones Industrial Average. The company faces risks and uncertain rewards as it vies with Airbus to replace Iran’s museum-vintage fleet. Congressional opponents have vowed to block the exports. Boeing may also need to leave wiggle room to back out of any potential orders if the next U.S. president decides to reinstate sanctions. For a QuickTake on Iran’s economy, click here There’s also no assurance that all the orders will materialize, given the uncertain finances of Iranian airlines and competition from their Persian Gulf counterparts. Opponents of the Boeing deal pointed out that the Treasury imposed sanctions on Iran Air in 2011 for using passenger and cargo planes to transport rockets and missiles to places such as Syria, sometimes disguised as medicine or spare parts. At other times, members of Iran’s Revolutionary Guards took control of flights carrying sensitive cargo. Those restrictions were lifted after an international nuclear agreement was signed in July 2015. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Weather Your 4-day local weather forecast Saturday November 19, 2016 News Local News Larger / SmallerNight Mode Qantas Boeing 747-400 to fly into Illawarra Regional Airport on Sunday 6 Mar 2015, 8:43 p.m. Qantas flight QF7474 will land at 7.47am on Sunday at Illawarra Regional Airport - weather permitting. Qantas pilot with a jumbo-size task OJA a cut above its predecessors Qantas flight QF7474 will land at 7.47am on Sunday at Illawarra Regional Airport - weather permitting. Qantas is donating its first Boeing 747-400, known as City of Canberra, to the Historical Aircraft Restoration Society (HARS), based at the airport. It will be the first 747-400 in the world to be preserved for public display and the biggest aircraft to be on show at the HARS facility. In control: Captains Ossie Miller and Greg Matthews, second officer Michael East and first officer Peter Hagley will be on board the flight on Sunday from Sydney. ADAM McLEAN The aircraft, registered as VH-OJA, made Australian aviation and Qantas history in 1989 for the longest non-stop commercial flight from London to Sydney in a time of 20 hours, 9 minutes and 5 seconds, a record that still stands. Its final flight will be its shortest, estimated at just 15 minutes, but the planning to land the flight at the small airport has been just as meticulous. There will be four pilots on the plane, led by Captain Greg Matthews, who is Qantas' manager of training and checking for the 747. Also on board is first officer Peter Hagley, a 747 technical pilot, second officer Michael East and Captain Ossie Miller, the 747 fleet captain and Bowral resident. Hats off to history: The Qantas pilots and crew who flew a 747-400 on a record-breaking flight in 1989 for the longest non-stop flight (London-Sydney) of any commercial airline The pilots have spent more than 25 hours in the Qantas flight simulator preparing for the landing. Qantas said the 747-400 aircraft usually landed on runways 45 metres wide and much longer than the Illawarra airport's 1819 metres. The Illawarra airport's runway is just 30 metres wide, and the aircraft has a wingspan of 64 metres so the two outside engines will hang over the runway's edge, but Captain Miller said the width was more than adequate. The pilots expect to leave Mascot's domestic terminal, taking off towards the south and climbing to 4000 feet. "This is quite low considering the aircraft is capable of flying to 45,000 feet and cruise in the mid to high 30,000s," Captain Miller said. "We'll depart Sydney with 20,000 kilograms of fuel. That will give us an opportunity to hold or if we need a second attempt at the approach and there will be enough fuel to get back to Sydney." Captain Miller said Qantas had reduced the tyre pressure to minimise any runway surface damage. "We worked with Boeing on this," he said. "We don't want a tail wind ... ideally we will have no wind or a southerly." When the landing has finished, a specially borrowed tug will leave the vehicle just short of the display area prepared by HARS. "There is still a certain amount of work engineers will need to do for the long-term storage ... some equipment needs to be deactivated or taken off," Captain Miller said. The aircraft's farewell and delivery to HARS is proving to be an emotional experience for past and present Qantas employees, Captain Miller included. "It is just a fabulous opportunity for me," Captain Miller said. ’‘I’ve been with Qantas for 29 years. I remember when I joined Qantas in 1986, David Massy-Greene was the project pilot of the 747-400 and I was a starry eyed second officer at the time. ‘‘I thought this plane was the most amazing thing I had ever seen. ‘‘To be here now and involved in the delivery of this aircraft is just a dream come true.’’ The Qantas Boeing 747-400 VH-OJA was in service for 25 years, made 13,833 flights and carried 4,094,568 passengers. This aircraft has flown nearly 85million kilometres, which is equivalent to 110.2 return trips to the moon. There will be no passengers on board VH-OJA’s final flight from Mascot to Illawarra Regional Airport. The flight path will see the 747 cross the coast at North Wollongong. VH-OJA will approach the airport from West Dapto at a speed of 132 knots, which is far lower than the usual 180 knots due to its lower than normal weight. The aircraft VH-OJA is being donated in pristine condition. It will have Permagard protection to preserve the colouring of the livery and the red tail. VH-OJA was Qantas’ first Boeing 747-400 aircraft and was named the City of Canberra. All of Qantas’ B747-400 aircraft have the name Longreach as a tribute to the Qantas place of origin and to symbolise the long-range of the aircraft. The Qantas group has 297 aircraft. It is reducing the types of aircraft it has from 11 to seven. Qantas has 12 747-400s, three, including VH- OJA are being retired,  and nine will be reconfigured. The VH-OJA ‘‘has too much history to go to the desert’’. One of the four engines will remain on the aircraft, but three engines will be removed and used by Qantas on other 747s.  Latest News Buckingham Palace to undergo $600 million renovation Biggest housing construction boom in Sydney's history on the way Will the US resettlement deal restart flow of boats?

"We understand that the U.S. government has issued Airbus a license to sell aircraft to Iran," Chicago-based Boeing said in a statement. "We believe their license application was submitted prior to our similar request and that the government follows a 'first in, first out' policy. We look forward to receiving our license from the government shortly." Sales to Iran would provide an important boost to the order books of Boeing and Airbus during a year when sales have slowed. Iran has said it needs 400 planes to rebuild its commercial aircraft fleet after decades of isolation. Boeing and Airbus have reached provisional agreements to sell more than 100 jetliners each to Iran's national airline, a pair of deals valued at more than $50 billion at list prices. The sales follow a landmark agreement on Iran's nuclear program last year. Airbus Group shares were up 0.74 percent at 52.86 euros. Boeing shares were up 0.9 percent at $128.96. The sales still face obstacles from bankers, who are cautious because U.S. banks remain barred from doing business with Iran.

European airplane manufacturer Airbus announced the license from the U.S. Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control early Wednesday. Chicago-based Boeing followed with its own announcement later in the day. The approval clears the way for the two plane manufacturers to access one of the last untapped aviation markets in the world. Both companies have announced separate $25-billion deals to sell aircraft to airlines in the country, although analysts are skeptical that there is demand for so many jets or available financing. The deal would be the biggest for an American company since the 1979 Islamic Revolution and U.S. Embassy takeover. The announcements come as Iranian and U.S. leaders are in New York for the United Nations General Assembly and shows that the outgoing administration of President Barack Obama is honoring the economic terms of the nuclear pact. Though based abroad, Airbus needed the approval of the U.S. Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control for the deal because at least 10 percent of the manufacturer's components are of American origin. Airbus applied for two licenses to cover its deal with Iran to ensure the fast delivery of some of the aircraft, Airbus spokesman Justin Dubon told The Associated Press. The license announced Wednesday covers the first 17 planes involved in the deal, which will be A320s and A330s, he said. Dubon said Airbus hoped to receive a second license allowing it to sell the remaining planes to Iran soon. Iran's U.N. mission did not respond to a request for comment Wednesday. State television referred to an AP report on the sale. Iran's nuclear deal with world powers, which limits its enrichment of uranium in exchange for the lifting of some international sanctions, specifically allowed for the purchase of aircraft and parts. That's set off a race between airplane manufacturers for the newly opened market, home to 80 million people. In January, national carrier Iran Air signed agreements to buy 118 planes from Airbus, estimated to be worth some 22.8 billion euros ($25 billion). On Sunday, state TV reported that Asghar Fakhrieh Kashan, a deputy transportation minister, said Iran would cut the number of Airbus planes to 112. Base model A320s are listed at an average of $98 million, while A330s start at $231.5 million. That puts the value of the approved 17 aircraft in the first license around at least $1.8 billion and possibly much higher based on list prices, though buyers typically negotiate sizable discounts for bulk orders. Under Boeing's deal, Iran Air will buy 80 aircraft with a total list price of $17.6 billion, with deliveries beginning in 2017 and running until 2025. Iran Air also will lease 29 new Boeing 737s. In a statement, Boeing spokesman Marc Sklar said "we have received that license and remain in talks with Iran Air" based on the memorandum of agreement reach in June. The Boeing deal has been criticized by American lawmakers over Iran's "pernicious behavior," including launching ballistic missiles, firing rockets near U.S. warships in the strategic Strait of Hormuz and briefly detaining American sailors who strayed into its territorial waters. The U.S. presidential election could also have an effect on the sales. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has threatened to tear up the nuclear deal if elected this November. Most Iranian planes were purchased before the Islamic Revolution that ousted Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi and brought Islamists to power. Out of Iran's 250 commercial planes, 162 were flying in June, while the rest were grounded due to lack of spare parts. Iran Air, whose website lists 43 airplanes in its fleet, says it has direct flights to over 30 international destinations, including London. ___ Online: Airbus: www.airbus.com Boeing Co.: www.boeing.com Iran Air: www.iranair.com ___ Associated Press writers Nasser Karimi in Tehran, Iran, Scott Mayerowitz in New York and Adam Schreck contributed to this report. ___ Follow Jon Gambrell on Twitter at www.twitter.com/jongambrellap.

Share Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on В Контакте Share on Google+ Email to a Friend Print The U.S. Treasury Department has granted licenses to Airbus and Boeing to sell jet planes to Iran in multibillion-dollar deals. European aerospace giant Airbus was the first to receive a license allowing that allows it to sell the first 17 planes in a landmark deal with Iran. Airbus spokesman Justin Dubon told AP on September 21 that Airbus received the license and that the first 17 planes will be A320s and A330s. Boeing announced later in the day that it had also been given approval by the Treasury Department. A Boeing spokesman said it is still negotiating terms with Iran on the sale of as many as 109 jetliners. Earlier this year, national airliner Iran Air signed agreements to buy 118 planes from Airbus in a deal estimated to be worth some 22.8 billion euros ($25 billion). The deal was made possible by last year's historic nuclear agreement, which lifted sanctions on Iran in return for it curbing its nuclear program. Both Airbus and Boeing have agreed to sell or lease more than 100 aircraft each to Iran Air as Tehran rebuilds its aviation sector following years of international sanctions because of its controversial nuclear program.

"We understand that the U.S. government has issued Airbus a license to sell aircraft to Iran," Chicago-based Boeing said in a statement. "We believe their license application was submitted prior to our similar request and that the government follows a 'first in, first out' policy. We look forward to receiving our license from the government shortly." Sales to Iran would provide an important boost to the order books of Boeing and Airbus during a year when sales have slowed. Iran has said it needs 400 planes to rebuild its commercial aircraft fleet after decades of isolation. Boeing and Airbus have reached provisional agreements to sell more than 100 jetliners each to Iran's national airline, a pair of deals valued at more than $50 billion at list prices. The sales follow a landmark agreement on Iran's nuclear program last year. Airbus Group shares were up 0.74 percent at 52.86 euros. Boeing shares were up 0.9 percent at $128.96. The sales still face obstacles from bankers, who are cautious because U.S. banks remain barred from doing business with Iran.

According to the report carried by Reuters, the US Treasury issued two licenses on Wednesday whereby Airbus can sell 17 aircraft to Iran. Although based in Europe, Airbus needs US approval because of the high number of US parts in its jets. The report added that the US Treasury is expected to start approving sales of Boeing jets within days as well. Iran provisionally agreed earlier this year to buy over 200 jets worth $50 billion at list prices from Airbus and Boeing following the removal of anti-Tehran sanctions. Later, the US House of Representatives in July passed two amendments that would stop the aircraft sales, although to become law they need to be approved by the Senate and signed by President Barack Obama. While the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) - a lasting nuclear deal between Tehran and world powers- came into force in January, some Iranian officials have complained about the US failure to fully implement the accord. Back in March, Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Seyed Ali Khamenei said Americans have yet to fulfill what they were supposed to do as per the nuclear deal. Iran still has problems in its banking transactions or in restoring its frozen assets, because Western countries and those involved in such processes are afraid of Americans, the Leader said at the time, criticizing the US for its moves to prevent Iran from taking advantage of the sanctions removal.

Europe's Airbus said on Wednesday it had received U.S. Treasury approval to begin exporting jets to Iran, under a deal for more than 100 jets struck in January. Hours later, its U.S. rival Boeing, which had been behind Airbus in the queue for permits because its matching deal for over 100 jets came six months later, said it had received a sales licence and remained in talks with IranAir. The U.S. Treasury confirmed issuing two licences. The move removes a key hurdle to one of the most high-profile deals between Iran and foreign companies since last year's agreement between Tehran and world powers to open up trade in exchange for curbs on the country's nuclear activities. But major questions remain over the financing of deals between Iran and Western planemakers that threaten to obstruct deliveries of the planes, in what is seen as a test case for Western trade and investment following the nuclear deal. "This sends a strong signal but it resolves only half the problem. The challenge to raise financing remains," Bertrand Grabowski, a managing director at German's DVB Bank, said. Foreign banks are reluctant to finance the aircraft deals, fearing they could fall foul of remaining U.S. sanctions that prohibit the use of its financial system for Iranian business, something difficult to avoid in a complex global supply chain. With U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump strongly critical of the rapprochement, some banks fear they could be left with no insurance if Iran sanctions "snap back". The deals by Airbus and Boeing to sell or lease over 200 jets to flag carrier IranAir would help modernise and expand the country's elderly fleet, held together by smuggled or improvised parts after years of sanctions. But nine months after the first deal was signed, Iranian officials had voiced growing concerns about what they saw as unfair delays in obtaining U.S. licences or clarity over banking and financing rules. Tehran's deputy roads and urban development minister told the CAPA Iran Aviation Finance Summit in Tehran this week that failing to clear the jet sales would put Washington in "breach" of the nuclear pact. OPPOSITION TO DEALS Diplomats say the new jets will allow pragmatist President Hassan Rouhani to argue the sanctions deal is working, several months ahead of Iranian presidential elections in May next year. But the deals remain strongly opposed by U.S. Republicans who say the jets could be misused for military purposes and by conservatives in Iran who oppose the country's more open stance and say the purchases will not benefit most Iranians. As the Obama administration moved to begin allowing the sales, Republicans blasted U.S. policy towards Iran. Paul Ryan, Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, said the administration "bends over backwards" to help Iran. Airbus said it had been granted an initial licence to supply 17 A320 or A330 jets that are slated for early delivery, and that it expected a second licence for remaining jets in weeks. An Iranian official told Reuters this week a deal for 118 Airbus jets had been trimmed by six amid regulatory delays, and that a deal to buy or lease 109 Boeing aircraft, including 80 purchased directly, had been shaved to 108. Iran has also ordered up to 40 Franco-Italian ATR turboprop planes needing U.S. approval.

پارسی العربية اردو کوردی Türkçe English Mehrnews English Fri 18 November 2016 × Economy Home All News Iran World Politics Economy Culture Technology Sports Photo Cartoon Video Opinion News on Boeing 737 purchase rejected News ID: 3775108 - Wed 21 September 2016 - 13:23 Economy TEHRAN, Sep. 21 (MNA) – An official at Civil Aviation Organization of Iran (CAOI) clarified that a 737 jet has been rented and not purchased by Iranian Naft Airlines. Reza Jafarzadeh, the Head of Iran's Civil Aviation Organization public relations office, rejected the earlier news on purchase of Boeing 737 by Naft Airlines underling that the aircraft has only been leased out to Iran. Previously, Managing Director of Iranian Naft Airlines Nurollah Rezai Niyaraki was quoted as saying that “one of the four Boeing 737 single-aisle jetliners bought from the US was delivered to Naft Airlines on Sunday.” However, purchase of Boeing aero planes by Iran is still faced by restrictions imposed by the US Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC). Iran Air and America's Boeing inked an MoU in June over sales of 80 aircraft and lease of 29 more in a potential deal worth about $25 billion while the deal faced opposition in US Congress raising doubts about deliveries of the jets.

The "Green Growler" aircraft flew using a bio JP-5 fuel instead of the petroleum based JP-5. Lt. Cmdr. Bradley Fairfax, project officer and test pilot with Air Test and Evaluation Squadron (VX) 23, said that he couldn't tell the difference between the two fuels in terms of the flight conditions and the aircraft flew the same as the petroleum based JP-5 for the duration of the flight. Flight test engineer Mary Picard monitored the ground and test flights and agreed with the test pilot's observations. This fuel program supports the secretary of the navy's (SECNAV) energy goal of increasing the use of alternative fuels in the navy by year 2020.

Iran announced plans in January to buy 118 jets worth $27 billion at list prices from Europe's Airbus but has complained about unexpected delays in receiving U.S. licenses, which are needed due to the large number of U.S.-supplied parts. The country’s deputy transport minister told a conference on Monday there were signs the U.S. Treasury would release the crucial licenses by the end of this month. But speaking again on Tuesday, he stepped up criticism of what Iran sees as unfair delays in unblocking the deal, which is part of efforts to rebuild Iran's elderly fleet that were built into a pact between Tehran and world powers to lift most Western sanctions in exchange for limits on Iran’s nuclear activities. "There are six fewer aircraft. These are the ones that were due to be delivered in 2016," the Iranian official told Reuters, speaking on the sidelines of the CAPA Iran Aviation Finance Summit in Tehran. The deal to be finalised with Airbus in coming weeks could therefore be for 112 aircraft instead of 118, he said. On paper, these include 12 of Airbus's A380 superjumbos but Iran has not yet decided whether to take the double-decker jets, and has an option to convert them to smaller models, he said. Reuters first reported in June that Iran was having second thoughts about taking the world's largest passenger plane. The latest move takes further shine off the deal signed in Paris during a visit by Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, but Western officials say it still represents a promising symbol of a new political and economic relationship with Iran. Boeing, which has also agreed to provide jets to Iran as it emerges from sanctions, may see its deal clipped by one jet to 108 aircraft instead of 109, the Iranian official said. Boeing said in June it had provisionally agreed to sell 80 planes directly to IranAir and to oversee the lease of a further 29. The Iranian official did not say whether the canceled aircraft would come from the column of direct purchases or leases, nor whether it had been cut for the same reason as Airbus, but Boeing is also on the waiting list for licenses. Both planemakers said they do not comment on discussions with airlines and would only act within U.S. regulations. Speaking at the CAPA conference, Western envoys sought to allay Iranian concerns over the delays in approving the airplane deals. They expressed optimism the deals would go ahead and reiterated their commitment to last year's nuclear deal. Unpicking years of sanctions is a complex task, complicated further in Washington by the fact that U.S. primary sanctions remain in effect, French Ambassador Francois Senemaud said. One person familiar with the process said the U.S. Treasury was moving ahead in its discussions and a license decision, initially on the Airbus side of the deal, could come in weeks. Others have suggested the politically sensitive decision on whether to supply Western jets, opposed by many Republicans, could slip beyond November's U.S. presidential election.

The city will be the low cost carrier's third hub after Delhi and Hyderabad and will be a base for both Boeing B 737-800 and Bombardier Dash 8 Q400 aircraft. Emerging from a meeting with chief minister Mamata Banerjee, Singh who had started the airline in 2004 and scripted its turnaround after it went into a tailspin and crash-landed in 2014, said the airline was now ready for expansion and had decided to start with Kolkata as the mar ket was under-served and offered great potential. "We are looking at expanding domestic and international network from Kolkata. In the immediate future, departures will go up 40% from 15 to 21. Apart from adding two more frequencies to Guwahati, we will connect to Aizwal, Sil char and Gorakhpur from October 4. We will also connect Vizag and Jaipur from November-December. The CM has requested for connec tions to Durgapur and Bhubaneswar. We will examine the former proposal but the latter looks feasible," Singh said. While Bombardier aircraft will be used for regional connections, Jaipur and Vizag markets are likely to be serviced by Boeing planes. Apart from the surge in regional connectivity, SpiceJet is also firming up plans to increase its international operations from Kolkata that is currently restricted to a daily Bangkok flight. The airline plans to increase the frequency on the Kolkata-Bangkok sector to twice daily from December and daily to Dhaka and Chittagong with Bombardier from the same month. "We are also evaluating flights to Yangon, Dubai and Sharjah from Kolkata. There is a good demand for low-cost flights to these cities from Kolkata," said Singh. At present, full service carriers Emirates, Qatar and Etihad operate to the Gulf. The airline CMD urged Mamata to take up the issue of exemption of landing and parking charges for sub-80 seater regional aircraft at Kolkata airport. Though a policy exists, it is not enforced in metro airports. Offering her assurance, Mamata said her government would extend full support to the airline. She also requested Singh to introduce a direct flight to Europe and Far East from Kolkata. Speaking to TOI, the airline boss said the airline did not have planes to do the distance. "We will continue to explore possibility in shorthaul flights in a 4-hour radius. That restricts us to West and South-East Asia," Singh pointed out.

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it September 21 IRAN Airbus gets permission from U.S. for plane sale Airbus on Wednesday became the first airplane manufacturer to get U.S. government permission to sell aircraft to Iran in the wake of last year’s nuclear accord, getting final approval for a 17-plane sale that is part of a larger $25 billion deal. The European company’s announcement showed that the outgoing administration of President Obama is honoring the economic terms of the nuclear pact. The next administration, however, may change that equation for Airbus and U.S.-based Boeing, which has its own deal with Iran on the line. Though based abroad, Airbus needed the approval of the U.S. Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control for the deal because at least 10 percent of Airbus components are of American origin. Airbus applied for two licenses to cover its deal to ensure the fast delivery of some of the aircraft, spokesman Justin Dubon said. The license announced Wednesday covers the first 17 planes involved in the deal, he said. In January, Iran Air signed agreements to buy 118 planes from Airbus, estimated to be worth about $25 billion. Iran’s nuclear deal with world powers, which limits its enrichment of uranium in exchange for the lifting of some international sanctions, specifically allowed for the purchase of aircraft and parts. — Associated Press EGYPT Boat capsizes, killing at least 42 migrants A boat carrying African migrants headed to Europe capsized Wednesday off the Mediterranean coast near the Egyptian city of Alexandria, killing at least 42 people, Egyptian authorities said. Alaa Osman, an official in Beheira province, said the migrants were from several African countries. He said that 155 people had been rescued but that bodies were still being pulled from the water. Egypt’s official Middle East News Agency said the boat was carrying 600 people when it sank. Thousands of illegal migrants have made the dangerous sea voyage across the Mediterranean in recent years, fleeing war and poverty, mostly via lawless Libya. Thousands have drowned. The number of migrants trying to cross the Mediterranean Sea from Egypt to Europe has increased significantly in the past year, the European Union’s border agency said this month. More than 12,000 migrants arrived in Italy from Egypt between January and September, compared with 7,000 in the same period last year, Frontex said. — Associated Press IRAQ Finance chief ousted amid economic crisis Iraq’s parliament dismissed the finance minister after a no-confidence vote Wednesday, a move that risks further upsetting the country’s precarious economic situation. Hoshyar Zebari, a former foreign minister and a prominent Kurdish politician, was ousted after weeks of political wrangling over corruption allegations and accusations of misuse of funds. Zebari has denied wrongdoing. Zebari played a key role in securing a badly needed $5.34 billion loan from the International Monetary Fund in July. An additional $18 billion could be unlocked, but each step will take longer to implement without a finance minister. Zebari is the second minister to be dismissed by parliament, which last month voted to fire the defense minister. In July, the prime minister accepted the resignation of the interior minister after a deadly bombing. Like other oil-reliant countries, Iraq’s economy has been hit hard by plummeting prices since 2014, forcing the government to introduce austerity measures. — Associated Press Libya resumes oil exports from key port: Libya’s official news agency said the country has resumed oil exports from a terminal seized by troops loyal to a powerful eastern military commander. LANA reported that tankers loaded with crude departed from the Ras Lanuf terminal. Forces commanded by Gen. Khalifa Hifter this month seized Ras Lanuf and two other terminals from a militia aligned with the U.N.-backed unity government in Tripoli. Hifter and authorities in eastern Libya reject the U.N.-brokered government. Rift Valley fever kills 21 in Niger: Health workers in western Niger are racing to contain an outbreak of Rift Valley fever that has killed at least 21 people the past month, an aid agency said. The contagious disease, which is transmitted to humans by mosquitoes or close contact with contaminated animals, has infected 52 people in Niger’s western region of Tahoua since August, the Health Ministry said. — From news services national Dallas shooting updates News and analysis on the deadliest day for police since 9/11. post_newsletter353 follow-dallas false after3th false Please provide a valid email address.

The FOMC maintained the Fed policy rate at between 0.25% and 0.50% to no one’s particular surprise. There were other developments that we have discussed elsewhere. WTI crude oil for November delivery settled at $45.34 a barrel, up 2.9% for the day. December gold closed up 1% on the day to settle at $1,331.40. Equities were headed for a higher close shortly before the bell as the DJIA traded up by 0.95% for the day, the S&P 500 traded up 1.16%, and the Nasdaq Composite traded up 1.10%. The DJIA stock posting the largest daily percentage gain ahead of the close Wednesday was The Boeing Co. (NYSE: BA) which traded up 2.17% at $130.56. The stock’s 52-week range is $120.10 to $150.59. Volume was about 35% below the daily average of around 3.6 million shares. The company said this afternoon that it has received federal government approval to sell airplanes to Iran. Competitor Airbus received similar approval earlier this morning. Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE: CAT) traded up 2.02% at $83.85. The stock’s 52-week range is $56.36 to $84.73. Volume was about 25% below the daily average of around 4.3 million shares. The industrial giant said that it plans to invest $1 billion in Africa, but the gain is more likely due to the strong crude oil price move and the lack of a hike in the Fed’s interest rate. Chevron Corp. (NYSE: CVX) traded up 1.97% at $99.62. The stock’s 52-week range is $75.10 to $107.58. Trading volume was about 25% below the daily average of around 6.5 million. The supermajor oil and gas producer got a boost today from the U.S. EIA’s inventory report. United Technologies Corp. (NYSE: UTX) traded up 1.82% at $102.06. The stock’s 52-week range is $83.39 to $109.83. Volume was about 15% below the daily average of around 3.4 million shares. The company lowered its Pratt & Whitney division’s delivery targets for the year, but continues to back its long-term earnings estimates. Of the 30 Dow index stocks 27 are on track to close higher Wednesday and 3 are set to close lower.

The Fed said in a statement Wednesday that the U.S. job market has continued to strengthen and economic activity has picked up. But it noted that business investment remains soft and inflation too low and that it wants to see further improvement in the job market. The central bank characterized the near-term risks to its economic outlook as "roughly balanced." It was the first time it has used that wording since late last year, when it most recently raised rates. ___ US stocks jump after Fed leaves interest rates unchanged NEW YORK -- U.S. stocks climbed Wednesday as investors were relieved that the Federal Reserve once again left interest rates unchanged. That sent dividend-paying stocks higher, while energy companies jumped with the price of oil. Stocks made a big gain after the Fed's decision, which ended about weeks of confusion for investors. With the central bank confirming that it will raise interest rates slowly, bond yields dropped and utility and phone companies rose. The price of oil rose after the U.S. government said energy stockpiles shrank last week. ___ Interim Viacom CEO to leave, dividend slashed NEW YORK -- Viacom says interim CEO Tom Dooley will leave Nov. 15 and the company is cutting its dividend in half. Dooley was installed after its prior CEO Philippe Dauman was pushed out in August as part of a settlement with National Amusements, a private company that holds controlling stakes in both Viacom Inc. and CBS Corp. Viacom, which owns the Paramount Pictures and pay TV channels such as Comedy Central and MTV, has been struggling to improve its profit as its movie studio struggled to produce hits and cable viewership declines. ___ Mylan CEO defends EpiPen cost to angry lawmakers WASHINGTON -- Outraged lawmakers grilled the head of pharmaceutical company Mylan on Wednesday about the cost increase for EpiPens and the profits for a company. CEO Heather Bresch said that she wishes the company had "better anticipated the magnitude and acceleration" of the rising prices for some families. But maintained that her company doesn't make much profit from each emergency allergy shot. The price for EpiPens has grown to $608 for a two-pack, an more than 500 percent increase since 2007. Lawmakers say families struggling to pay for the shots have every right to be angry at Mylan. ___ Your TV may use more energy than you think, group charges SAN FRANCISCO -- An environmental group on Wednesday accused three major television manufacturers of misleading consumers and regulators about how much energy their high-definition screens devour by designing them to draw less power during government testing than in ordinary use. The report by the Natural Resources Defense Council concluded that the TVs made by Samsung, LG Electronics and Vizio saddle households with an extra $120 million in electricity bills each year and generate tons of additional pollution. The added expense works out to about $10 to $20 per household annually over the anticipated decade-long life of the typical widescreen TV. ___ Tesla updates software to improve radar DETROIT -- Tesla Motors customers will get enhanced radar and other features in an over-the-air software update that starts Wednesday night. The update makes the Model S sedan and Model X SUV rely more reliant on radar than cameras when driving in Tesla's semi-autonomous Autopilot mode. Teslas made after October 2014 have radar. Tesla CEO Elon Musk says the change should help avoid crashes like the one that killed a Tesla driver in Florida in May. That driver - who was using Autopilot - crashed into a tractor-trailer that Tesla's camera failed to detect. ___ 1,400 investor lawsuits seek 8.2 billion euros from VW FRANKFURT, Germany -- A German court says it has been flooded with1,400 investor lawsuits against Volkswagen seeking damages worth 8.2 billion euros ($9.2 billion). The regional court in Braunschweig said Wednesday that 750 lawsuits arrived on Monday alone from a single law office as a possible one-year deadline to file approached. The court said the Volkswagen investor lawsuits equaled about half of its normal intake for an entire year. Investors claim Volkswagen did not disclose in a timely way that it faced costly action from U.S. regulators over cars with software that enabled them to cheat on diesel emissions tests. ___ SEC accuses hedge fund manager Cooperman of insider trading WASHINGTON -- Federal regulators have accused high-profile hedge fund manager Leon Cooperman and his firm of illegally trading on confidential information he learned from a company executive. The Securities and Exchange Commission announced the civil insider-trading charges Wednesday against Cooperman and his firm, Omega Advisors. The SEC also alleged that Cooperman tried to cover up the misconduct. The SEC indicated it was sending a message that well known and wealthy people aren't exempt from its efforts to pursue insider trading. Cooperman's attorneys said the allegations are "entirely baseless." ___ US grants Airbus, Boeing a chance to sell airplanes to Iran DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- The U.S. government granted aviation giants Airbus and Boeing permission on Wednesday to sell aircraft to Iran following last year's nuclear accord. European airplane manufacturer Airbus announced the license from the U.S. Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control early Wednesday. Chicago-based Boeing followed with its own announcement later in the day. The approval clears the way for the two plane manufacturers to access one of the last untapped aviation markets in the world. ___ Zuckerberg, Chan pledge $3B to end disease Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has a goal that's even more ambitious than connecting the entire world to the internet: He and his wife want to help eradicate all disease by the end of this century. Zuckerberg and Priscilla Chan are committing $3 billion over the next 10 years to accelerate basic scientific research, including the creation of research tools - from software to hardware to yet-undiscovered techniques - they hope will ultimately lead to scientific breakthroughs, the way the microscope and DNA sequencing have in generations past. ___ UK report say hiring at some firms on hold post-Brexit LONDON -- A new Bank of England survey suggests some businesses are freezing both investment and hiring in the aftermath of Britain's vote to leave the European Union, with broadly flat levels of spending in the next six months to a year. The so-called agents' summary of business conditions revealed that in some sectors, such as commercial real estate, "all non-essential recruitment had been frozen." But the bank says businesses were more optimistic following the initial shock of the vote. Allan Monks, economist at JP Morgan, says the report suggests an impact that over time "will still have significant adverse economic implications." ___ The Dow Jones industrial average gained 163.74 points, or 0.9 percent, to 18,293.70. The Standard & Poor's 500 index surged 23.36 points, or 1.1 percent, to 2,163.12. The Nasdaq composite added 53.83 points, or 1 percent, to a record 5,295.18. Benchmark U.S. crude added $1.29, or 2.9 percent, to $45.34 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, rose 95 cents, or 2.1 percent, to $46.83 a barrel in London. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline rose 3 cents, or 2.5 percent, to $1.40 a gallon. Heating oil added 2 cents, or 1.7 percent, to $1.43 a gallon. Natural gas gained 1 cent to $3.06 per 1,000 cubic feet.

Dooley was installed after its prior CEO Philippe Dauman was pushed out in August as part of a settlement with National Amusements, a private company that holds controlling stakes in both Viacom Inc. and CBS Corp. Viacom, which owns the Paramount Pictures and pay TV channels such as Comedy Central and MTV, has been struggling to improve its profit as its movie studio struggled to produce hits and cable viewership declines. ___ Mylan CEO defends EpiPen cost to angry lawmakers WASHINGTON (AP) — Outraged lawmakers grilled the head of pharmaceutical company Mylan on Wednesday about the cost increase for EpiPens and the profits for a company. CEO Heather Bresch said that she wishes the company had “better anticipated the magnitude and acceleration” of the rising prices for some families. But maintained that her company doesn’t make much profit from each emergency allergy shot. The price for EpiPens has grown to $608 for a two-pack, an more than 500 per cent increase since 2007. Lawmakers say families struggling to pay for the shots have every right to be angry at Mylan. ___ Your TV may use more energy than you think, group charges SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — An environmental group on Wednesday accused three major television manufacturers of misleading consumers and regulators about how much energy their high-definition screens devour by designing them to draw less power during government testing than in ordinary use. The report by the Natural Resources Defence Council concluded that the TVs made by Samsung, LG Electronics and Vizio saddle households with an extra $120 million in electricity bills each year and generate tons of additional pollution. The added expense works out to about $10 to $20 per household annually over the anticipated decade-long life of the typical widescreen TV. ___ Tesla updates software to improve radar DETROIT (AP) — Tesla Motors customers will get enhanced radar and other features in an over-the-air software update that starts Wednesday night. The update makes the Model S sedan and Model X SUV rely more reliant on radar than cameras when driving in Tesla’s semi-autonomous Autopilot mode. Teslas made after October 2014 have radar. Tesla CEO Elon Musk says the change should help avoid crashes like the one that killed a Tesla driver in Florida in May. That driver — who was using Autopilot — crashed into a tractor-trailer that Tesla’s camera failed to detect. ___ 1,400 investor lawsuits seek 8.2 billion euros from VW FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) — A German court says it has been flooded with1,400 investor lawsuits against Volkswagen seeking damages worth 8.2 billion euros ($9.2 billion). The regional court in Braunschweig said Wednesday that 750 lawsuits arrived on Monday alone from a single law office as a possible one-year deadline to file approached. The court said the Volkswagen investor lawsuits equaled about half of its normal intake for an entire year. Investors claim Volkswagen did not disclose in a timely way that it faced costly action from U.S. regulators over cars with software that enabled them to cheat on diesel emissions tests. ___ SEC accuses hedge fund manager Cooperman of insider trading WASHINGTON (AP) — Federal regulators have accused high-profile hedge fund manager Leon Cooperman and his firm of illegally trading on confidential information he learned from a company executive. The Securities and Exchange Commission announced the civil insider-trading charges Wednesday against Cooperman and his firm, Omega Advisors. The SEC also alleged that Cooperman tried to cover up the misconduct. The SEC indicated it was sending a message that well known and wealthy people aren’t exempt from its efforts to pursue insider trading. Cooperman’s attorneys said the allegations are “entirely baseless.” ___ US grants Airbus, Boeing a chance to sell airplanes to Iran DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — The U.S. government granted aviation giants Airbus and Boeing permission on Wednesday to sell aircraft to Iran following last year’s nuclear accord. European airplane manufacturer Airbus announced the license from the U.S. Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control early Wednesday. Chicago-based Boeing followed with its own announcement later in the day. The approval clears the way for the two plane manufacturers to access one of the last untapped aviation markets in the world. ___ Zuckerberg, Chan pledge $3B to end disease Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has a goal that’s even more ambitious than connecting the entire world to the internet: He and his wife want to help eradicate all disease by the end of this century. Zuckerberg and Priscilla Chan are committing $3 billion over the next 10 years to accelerate basic scientific research, including the creation of research tools — from software to hardware to yet-undiscovered techniques — they hope will ultimately lead to scientific breakthroughs, the way the microscope and DNA sequencing have in generations past. ___ UK report say hiring at some firms on hold post-Brexit LONDON (AP) — A new Bank of England survey suggests some businesses are freezing both investment and hiring in the aftermath of Britain’s vote to leave the European Union, with broadly flat levels of spending in the next six months to a year. The so-called agents’ summary of business conditions revealed that in some sectors, such as commercial real estate, “all non-essential recruitment had been frozen.” But the bank says businesses were more optimistic following the initial shock of the vote. Allan Monks, economist at JP Morgan, says the report suggests an impact that over time “will still have significant adverse economic implications.” ___ The Dow Jones industrial average gained 163.74 points, or 0.9 per cent, to 18,293.70. The Standard & Poor’s 500 index surged 23.36 points, or 1.1 per cent, to 2,163.12. The Nasdaq composite added 53.83 points, or 1 per cent, to a record 5,295.18. Benchmark U.S. crude added $1.29, or 2.9 per cent, to $45.34 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, rose 95 cents, or 2.1 per cent, to $46.83 a barrel in London. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline rose 3 cents, or 2.5 per cent, to $1.40 a gallon. Heating oil added 2 cents, or 1.7 per cent, to $1.43 a gallon. Natural gas gained 1 cent to $3.06 per 1,000 cubic feet. shares Share: Twitter Facebook LinkedIn Google+ Share Email Advertisement Advertisement    Leave a comment Hide comments Comments are closed.

Most Iranian planes were purchased before the 1979 Islamic Revolution. Photo: Vahid Salemi, Associated Press Airbus says US grants license for planes in Iran deal 1 / 1 Back to Gallery DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — Airbus announced Wednesday that the U.S. government has granted it a license to sell the first 17 airplanes involved in a landmark deal with Iran made possible by last year’s nuclear agreement. The announcement comes as Iranian leaders and U.S. officials are gathered this week in New York for the U.N. General Assembly and serves as a sign that the outgoing administration of President Obama will honor the economic terms of the accord. Airbus received the license from the U.S. Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control, Airbus spokesman Justin Dubon told the Associated Press. He said the first 17 planes will be A320s and A330s. He declined to offer a breakdown of how many of each are involved in the initial sale, but said Airbus hoped to receive a second license allowing it to sell the remaining planes to Iran. Though based in Europe, Airbus was required to get the U.S. Treasury’s approval for the deal as at least 10 percent of Airbus components are of American origin. ALSO Facebook adds FacioMetrics; a mansplaining hotline Judge scolds SF, Airbnb while staying fines in short-term rental case Airbnb aims to handle full-service travel, competing with Expedia Iran’s U.N. mission did not immediately respond to a request for comment and the country’s state media did not immediately report the approval. On Sunday, Asghar Fakhrieh Kashan, a deputy transportation minister, told reporters that he expected U.S. permission for all aircraft purchases “by the end of September” and that several airplanes would arrive by mid-March. In January, national carrier Iran Air signed agreements to buy 118 planes from Airbus, estimated to be worth some $25 billion. The deal included 21 A320ceos, 24 A320neos, 27 A330ceos, 18 A330neos, 16 A350-1000s and 12 double-decker A380s. Base model A320s are currently listed at an average of $98 million, while A330s start at $231.5 million. That puts the value of the approved 17 aircraft in the first license around at least $18 billion and possibly much higher based on list prices, though buyers typically negotiate sizable discounts for bulk orders. Most Iranian planes were purchased before the 1979 Islamic Revolution that ousted Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi and brought Islamists to power. Out of Iran’s 250 commercial planes, 162 were flying in June, while the rest are grounded due to lack of spare parts. The announcement by Airbus will be closely watched by Boeing, the Chicago company that has an agreement with Iran that Iranian officials have suggested could be worth as much as $25 billion. Such a deal would be the biggest between an American company and Iran since the Islamic Revolution and U.S. Embassy takeover. In a June letter to Congress, Boeing said the deal involves Iran Air buying 80 aircraft with a total list price of $17.6 billion, with deliveries beginning in 2017 and running until 2025. Iran Air also will lease 29 new Boeing 737s. Iran also has ordered 20 airplanes from French-Italian aircraft manufacturer ATR. Iran’s nuclear deal with world powers, which limits its enrichment of uranium in exchange for the lifting of some international sanctions, specifically allows for the purchase of aircraft and parts. However, the Boeing deal has been criticized by both American lawmakers and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump. In a statement, Boeing spokesman Marc Sklar said his company believed Airbus applied before it did and that the U.S. government “follows a first-in, first-out policy.” “We look forward to receiving our license from the government shortly,” he said.

Janet Blackmon Morgan jblackmon@thesunnews.com 1 of 2 i By Christian Boschult cboschult@thesunnewscom LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story Horry-Georgetown Technical College is building two new advanced manufacturing centers to house programs designed to fit the needs of industrial companies such as Mercedes, Boeing, Peddinghause and Conbraco. The groundbreaking for the $7 million manufacturing center on Allied Drive in Conway is next week, and the district is still waiting on funds for another new building in Georgetown, said college spokeswoman Mary Eaddy. The new buildings will house equipment for machine tool technology, welding and advanced welding, robotics, mechatronics, and other types of programs, said Eaddy. Honestly, the whole initiative behind this is improving the skill sets of our student graduates, doing more to help industry expand. Brandon Haselden, department chair of advanced manufacturing and industrial technologies at HGTC “There will be a variety of programs and more of an integration of skills,” she said. “For example, if an industry comes and wants a tailor-made program that may include robotics and mechatronics but they’re not interested in machine tool, they can work around those requirements for the industry to get a training program up and running faster for them.” Brandon Haselden, department chair of advanced manufacturing and industrial technologies at HGTC, said companies are having a harder time getting employees with skills in fields such as robotics, mechatronics and machine tool technology. “Honestly, the whole initiative behind this is improving the skill sets of our student graduates, doing more to help industry expand,” said Haselden. “At the end of the day, as industry becomes more efficient, implements new technologies, increases the bottom line, they then in turn hire more of our student graduates, and in the end both of us are succeeding together.” We really need more professors in the welding and machine tool area and advanced welding. Spokeswoman Mary Eaddy Eaddy said she didn’t know how many students would enroll, but said there’s a “high interest” in the program. “We’ll need more professors because the programs are filling up very, very fast,” she said. “We really need more professors in the welding and machine tool area and advanced welding.” The programs that will be housed in the manufacturing centers are attractive not only to high school students but also veterans, Eaddy said. “They’re looking for an opportunity to use technical skills to make a living for themselves and their families,” she said. “At the rate the salaries are for these kind of programs, they are really zeroing in on these programs.” Eaddy said she doesn’t know exactly when the Conway building will be finished, but the school expects to hold classes there by the fall of 2017. “Game changer” In Georgetown, the school has secured 75 percent of the funding for the $12 million, 30,000-square foot project, said Gregory Mitchell, vice president for workforce development and provost for the Georgetown and Grand Strand campuses. It’s game changer for these communities. Gregory Mitchell, vice president for workforce development and provost for the Georgetown and Grand Strand campuses The Georgetown location is being funded in part by a $2 million federal grant, $5 million in state money, funds from Georgetown County and the Georgetown County School District, said Mitchell. Classes should begin in spring 2018. “It’s game changer for these communities,” he said. “When businesses and industry are vetting these communities, one thing they want to know is ‘where are their trained personnel going to come from?’ It’s going to move things in a more progressive way to be available to support industry that’s supporting Boeing, BMW and Mercedes Benz in that Charleston region.” We’re excited about where we’re going and we’re definitely excited about the future of Georgetown County as well as Horry County. Gregory Mitchell, vice president for workforce development and provost for the Georgetown and Grand Strand campuses The Georgetown campus will house four programs: advanced manufacturing, machine tool, robotics and mechatronics, he said. “They’re on the coast; it’s a great place to live and raise a family. They’ve got great public schools, got a great community college, so this is definitely a game changer here,” said Mitchell. “We’re excited about where we’re going and we’re definitely excited about the future of Georgetown County as well as Horry County.” Christian Boschult, 843-626-0218, @TSN_Christian Related content Horry Georgetown Technical College develops new programs LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story Education Comments Videos facebook twitter email Share More Videos 1:58 Veronica Thompson remembers son Levi Moody's life Pause 1:44 Booker T.

All of the GovCon Index’s top four and seven of the CGI’s 10 largest net advancers are S&P 500 companies as all 11 co-listed stocks closed green. Defense primes Northrop Grumman (NYSE: NOC), Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT), Boeing (NYSE: BA) and L-3 Communications (NYSE: LLL) led all GCI gainers with government services contractor CACI International (NYSE: CACI) fifth. Armored truck manufacturer Navistar International (NYSE: NAV) closed as the GovCon Index’s top percentage performer and has surged 15.48 percent UBS lifted its price target on the stock Friday after the Volkswagen investment announced earlier in September. Navistar shares traded at a volume of 2.8 million shares Wednesday to double the three-month average. Newport News, Virginia-based shipbuilder Huntington Ingalls Industries (NYSE: HII) ended its three-day skid and that stock also doubled its three-month average volume during Wednesday trade. BAE Systems PLC closed down 1.41 percent to $27.99 on U.S. over-the-counter markets to end as the GCI’s lone decliner Wednesday after Barclays Capital reiterated its “Underweight” rating on the British defense contractor’s stock, which fell 2.02 percent to $6.93 in London. Barclays’ price target of $5.61 on BAE’s London-traded stock indicates a potential downside of 21.03 percent from Wednesday’s close. Energy shares paced the S&P 500’s rise and 10 out of 11 sectors advanced after the Fed announced unchanged interest rates in a reversal from slight negative territory shortly before the central bank’s statement. Fed policymakers indicated in its post-meeting statement a desire to see further evidence of labor market improvement and inflation objectives being met prior to a rate hike and welcomed “solid” jobs numbers in recent months. Futures markets have priced in 64-percent odds of a move in December versus 58 percent prior to the Fed’s statement, according to Reuters.

The Dow Jones industrial average closed about 160 points higher after the announcement, with Boeing contributing the most gains. The index had briefly dipped in negative territory ahead of the Fed’s announcement. “It was basically what I expected,” said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at First Standard Financial. “I think the real question over the next several weeks, as we get the next batch of data, will be whether December will be a rate hike of 50 basis points.” Read the full story › Share on Facebook Share on Twitter ShareEmail  Print Note: Read our discussion guidelines before commenting.

Airbus announced Wednesday, Sept. 21, 2016, that the U.S. government has granted it a license allowing it to sell the first 17 planes involved in a landmark deal with Iran. Most Iranian planes were purchased before the 1979 Islamic Revolution that ousted Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi and brought Islamists to power. (AP Photo/Vahid Salemi, File) DUBAI, United Arab Emirates - The U.S. government granted aviation giants Airbus and Boeing permission on Wednesday to sell aircraft to Iran following last year's nuclear accord. European airplane manufacturer Airbus announced the license from the U.S. Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control early Wednesday. Chicago-based Boeing followed with its own announcement later in the day. The approval clears the way for the two plane manufacturers to access one of the last untapped aviation markets in the world. Both companies have announced separate $25-billion deals to sell aircraft to airlines in the country, although analysts are skeptical that there is demand for so many jets or available financing. The deal would be the biggest for an American company since the 1979 Islamic Revolution and U.S. Embassy takeover. The announcements come as Iranian and U.S. leaders are in New York for the United Nations General Assembly and shows that the outgoing administration of President Barack Obama is honouring the economic terms of the nuclear pact. Though based abroad, Airbus needed the approval of the U.S. Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control for the deal because at least 10 per cent of the manufacturer's components are of American origin. Airbus applied for two licenses to cover its deal with Iran to ensure the fast delivery of some of the aircraft, Airbus spokesman Justin Dubon told The Associated Press. The license announced Wednesday covers the first 17 planes involved in the deal, which will be A320s and A330s, he said. Dubon said Airbus hoped to receive a second license allowing it to sell the remaining planes to Iran soon. Iran's U.N. mission did not respond to a request for comment Wednesday. State television referred to an AP report on the sale. Iran's nuclear deal with world powers, which limits its enrichment of uranium in exchange for the lifting of some international sanctions, specifically allowed for the purchase of aircraft and parts. That's set off a race between airplane manufacturers for the newly opened market, home to 80 million people. In January, national carrier Iran Air signed agreements to buy 118 planes from Airbus, estimated to be worth some 22.8 billion euros ($25 billion). On Sunday, state TV reported that Asghar Fakhrieh Kashan, a deputy transportation minister, said Iran would cut the number of Airbus planes to 112. Base model A320s are listed at an average of $98 million, while A330s start at $231.5 million. That puts the value of the approved 17 aircraft in the first license around at least $1.8 billion and possibly much higher based on list prices, though buyers typically negotiate sizable discounts for bulk orders. Under Boeing's deal, Iran Air will buy 80 aircraft with a total list price of $17.6 billion, with deliveries beginning in 2017 and running until 2025. Iran Air also will lease 29 new Boeing 737s. In a statement, Boeing spokesman Marc Sklar said "we have received that license and remain in talks with Iran Air" based on the memorandum of agreement reach in June. The Boeing deal has been criticized by American lawmakers over Iran's "pernicious behaviour," including launching ballistic missiles, firing rockets near U.S. warships in the strategic Strait of Hormuz and briefly detaining American sailors who strayed into its territorial waters. The U.S. presidential election could also have an effect on the sales. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has threatened to tear up the nuclear deal if elected this November. Most Iranian planes were purchased before the Islamic Revolution that ousted Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi and brought Islamists to power. Out of Iran's 250 commercial planes, 162 were flying in June, while the rest were grounded due to lack of spare parts. Iran Air, whose website lists 43 airplanes in its fleet, says it has direct flights to over 30 international destinations, including London. ___ Online: Airbus: www.airbus.com Boeing Co.: www.boeing.com Iran Air: www.iranair.com ___ Associated Press writers Nasser Karimi in Tehran, Iran, Scott Mayerowitz in New York and Adam Schreck contributed to this report. ___ Follow Jon Gambrell on Twitter at www.twitter.com/jongambrellap.

"Under the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), the United States committed to license the export of certain commercial passenger aircraft to Iran," a Treasury spokeswoman said in the statement. "We have issued the first two licenses for the export of certain commercial passenger aircraft to Iran under this new policy - to Boeing and Airbus. These licenses contain strict conditions to ensure that the planes will be used exclusively for commercial passenger use and cannot be resold or transferred to a designated entity." Both companies had already announced earlier in the day that they had received word of the approval from the government.

In a statement from the Federal Open Market Committee after this week's meeting, the central bank expressed confidence in economic growth, but not enough to make a move this month. Post Your Comments Share Cancel US Federal Reserve officials lowered their expectations for rate hikes in the years ahead Wednesday but teed up a likely move before the end of 2016.  In a statement from the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) after this week's meeting, the central bank expressed confidence in economic growth, but not enough to make a move this month. "The committee judges that the case for an increase in the federal funds rate has strengthened but decided, for the time being, to wait for further evidence of continued progress toward its objectives," the statement said. US stocks held higher on Wednesday after the Federal Reserve kept interest rates unchanged. The Dow Jones industrial average traded about 30 points higher after the announcement, with Boeing contributing the most gains. The S&P 500 gained 0.46 percent, with energy leading advancers and the Nasdaq composite traded about 0.2 percent higher. Stocks also hit session highs after the announcement. The tipoff for what could be a December move came at what appeared to be a remarkably divisive FOMC meeting, judging by the statement and an accompanying summary of economic projections. Three members from the hawkish Fed bloc – Esther George, Loretta Mester and Eric Rosengren – dissented from the statement, an unusual split considering Chair Janet Yellen's adeptness at keeping the committee united. It was the most "no" votes since the December 2014 meeting. Indeed, the so-called dot plot that shows individual members' expectations indicated notably wider dispersion than the June meeting. While most Fed officials foresee a gradual increase of rates, one member expected the rate to be little changed from the 0.65 percent level all the way through 2019. Another member, meanwhile, put the rate expectation at 3.75 percent by 2019, more than a percentage point above the consensus. Three members also indicated they do not want any hikes this year. The increase likely would come at the December meeting, considering the November session comes just ahead of the presidential election and there is no post-meeting news conference scheduled. The committee also reduced its expectations both for economic growth and inflation this year, though the statement said "the labor market has continued to strengthen and growth of economic activity has picked up from the modest pace seen in the first half of this year." "Although the unemployment rate is little changed in recent months, job gains have been solid, on average," the committee added. "Household spending has been growing strongly but business fixed income has remained soft." The committee noted that inflation still has not risen to the Fed's 2 percent target. The statement reflected a continued Fed belief that the target would be hit "as the transitory effects of past declines in energy and import prices dissipate and the labor market strengthens further." Fed officials had been concerned about global developments, particularly the Brexit vote and a slowdown in China. However, the statement made only passing mention of international developments. Importantly, the balance-of-risks assessment that Fed watchers monitor closely made a return appearance in the statement, with central bankers judging those risks to be "roughly balanced." Overall, though, projections reflected a substantial pivot for a Fed that had anticipated a full percentage point hike in its interest rate target this year. Instead, officials now foresee a move to a 0.65 percent level this year, or a quarter point from the current 0.4 percent funds level (the official policy is to target the rate between 0.25 percent and 0.5 percent). The Fed last hiked in December 2015, its only move higher in more than 10 years. In the years ahead, the committee sees two hikes in 2017 and three each in 2018 and 2019 that would bring the funds rate to about 2.625 percent, assuming that each increase would come in quarter-point increments. Coincidentally, the Fed projections now have retreated almost exactly to market expectations in the CNBC Fed Survey. As for growth, the committee now foresees full-year gross domestic product of just 1.8 percent, a decrease from the 2 percent estimate in June. The unemployment rate now is projected to be 4.8 percent, as compared to 4.7 percent in June, and headline inflation, which includes food and energy prices, is estimated at 1.3 percent, down from 1.4 percent in the last summary of economic projections that the Fed releases each quarter.

The U.S. carrier also is looking at adding more routes to China and the eastern U.S., and examining whether it should consider acquiring the A380 superjumbo, according to its chief executive officer. Flights to London are a goal but may be at the limit of what’s attainable after the carrier swapped its order for Airbus Group SE A350-800 jets to the shorter-range A330neo in 2014, Hawaiian Holdings Inc. CEO Mark Dunkerley said in an interview Wednesday. “We certainly hope the answer is yes but we don’t have all the information we need,” he said. “It’s going to depend on what our final seating configuration is and therefore the weight of the Neo and its exact performance and statistics when it’s actually built.” The Honolulu-based carrier is studying about a half-dozen new long-distance routes to destinations in North America and East Asia, Dunkerley said at the Aviation Club in London. More East Coast destinations in addition to New York are a possibility, as well as cities in Canada. China, where the airline serves only Beijing, is “the really exciting prospect,” he said. A380 to Honolulu? Southeast Asia is beyond the range of Hawaiian’s 23 current-generation A330s and nine Boeing Co. 767s, though more Australian flights would be an option, according to the CEO. The Briton took over as chief in 2005 when the company was in bankruptcy protection. Dunkerley, 52, said the airline is looking seriously at whether the Airbus A380 might have a role to play within its network, especially on routes such as those from Honolulu to Los Angeles, Tokyo and Las Vegas, which it serves with smaller wide-body planes six, three and two times daily respectively. The argument for using the superjumbo, which might be available on attractive terms either from Airbus or, soon, in the second-hand market, isn’t conclusive and Hawaiian needs convincing of the business case, Dunkerley said. Mark Lapidus, CEO of plane-leasing firm Amedeo, which has orders for 20 A380s, said in a phone interview that Honolulu is a natural destination for the double-decker given the city’s traffic volumes and relative isolation. “Hawaii would be a good fit for either a new or used A380,” he said. “The sector distances are at least eight hours in every direction.” Hawaiian will start taking delivery of 16 A321neo narrow-body jets next year and will use them on 2,600-mile (4,200-kilometer) trips to the U.S. West Coast, the core of its operations. That will enable the carrier to retire three 767s and switch more A330s to East Asian routes while still adding capacity, he said. Boeing 717 The carrier is also obtaining more Boeing 717s, used for intensive inter-island flying, taking the fleet from 18 planes to 20, at least. The A330-800neos are due for delivery between 2019 and 2021 and the plan for them hasn’t yet been determined, the CEO said. Following years of consolidation in the U.S. airline industry Hawaiian has emerged as one of the biggest independent carriers, and Dunkerley said he’d have to “do right by our stakeholders” and seriously consider any takeover approach that may come. The company has a market value of $2.46 billion, following an 83 percent surge in its share price over the past 12 months, the biggest gain among the 11 members of the Bloomberg U.S. Airlines Index. “If at some point an offer from somebody else comes on the table, that will have to compete with what our future looks like as a stand-alone,” he said. “I don’t think it’s appropriate for any management team ever to say,‘No, we’re not prepared to consider an offer.’ Down the road, who knows.” Hawaiian’s focus on one long-distance leisure market sets it apart from other top U.S. carriers, so it isn’t clear whether larger independents such as JetBlue Airways Corp. -- which earlier this year lost out to Alaska Air Group Inc. in a contest to buy Virgin America Inc. -- would consider it a good fit, he said. “What I don’t know and can’t answer is whether other airlines value that which we uniquely bring,” he said. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

The theme of today's U.N. International Day of Peace is sustainable development to eliminate poverty. It is an attractive goal. The problem is that the U.N.'s plans to diminish poverty leave capitalism in place and the plans to achieve peace ignore the United States as the dominant military power. RELATED: 6 Latin American Countries Boycott Temer's UN Address The overwhelming U.S. military domination is the greatest threat to world peace. In the past 15 years, the Pentagon's military machine has attacked 17 countries. These wars collectively, and each of them individually, are for economic and geopolitical domination. None of these wars have resulted in increased security or stability for the countries targeted or for the people of the U.S. While the U.S. has a smaller land army than it did 40 years ago, it has spread its smaller, but technologically-strong units throughout the world. There are more than 1,000 U.S. bases in more than 130 countries. The aggressive expansion of NATO—the U.S.-commanded military alliance—throughout Eastern Europe to the borders of Russia and the Pentagon’s efforts to encircle Russia and China with weapons shields are dangers to the entire world. For 70 years the U.S. has been the only country that has refused to commit to "no first strike" in nuclear weapons, even against an opponent who has no nuclear capacity. This threat to international peace creates global insecurity. Meanwhile CIA destabilization efforts throughout Latin America are an effort to push back the social gains of the past decade. Washington’s massively destructive wars in Central Asia, West Asia, the Middle East and North Africa are criminal policies that have created terrible destruction and millions of deaths and refugees. The U.S. leads the world in arms sales. This fuels conflict and death, while making enormous profits for the largest U.S. corporations such as Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, Raytheon, Boeing and General Dynamics. U.S. and other NATO countries have fed the war in Syria, which is the latest U.S.-led effort to impose “regime change.” Washington and its allies, including Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Qatar, have armed and financed many of the anti-government forces. The two years of uninvited U.S.-NATO bombing has ruined much of Syria's vital infrastructure. RELATED: NAM Summit Ends with Vow to Strengthen Developing World The U.S. also carried out regime-change wars against Iraq and Libya that led to the complete destruction of every secular state institution, including the very structures that provided full access to free education, free health care, electrification, potable water, modern infrastructure, irrigation and communication. The present wars are similar in tactics and objectives to Washington’s role in Central America in the 1980s, where it armed counter-revolutionary forces to impose regime change in Nicaragua and funded and armed Salvadoran and Guatemalan death squads. This destructive policy created millions of refugees from Central America, just as U. S. policies of regime change in the past 12 years of war in Iraq, Libya and Syria has created even more refugees. Endless U.S. wars are an endless profit stream for a handful of corporations and an endless source of misery for humanity. The U.S. military budget is larger than the next 10 countries combined and it grows every year. What is the cause of this monstrous war-production? It is a creature of the relentless capitalist drive to maximize profits. War and war production are more profitable than production for human need. At the end of World War II the U.S. had the largest capitalist economy by far—more than half of global production. For decades giant weapons programs insured steady super profits regardless of the ups and downs of the capitalist market. The crisis now, that has no solution, is that despite decades of trillion-dollar handouts to the military industrial complex, these government subsidies are no longer sufficient to buoy up the capitalist economy. The U.S. empire is now in decline and decay. It is therefore even more desperate and is waging wars on every front. RELATED: Emergency UN Meeting Called Over Deadly US Airstrikes in Syria Since 2007, the worldwide capitalist economy has been stagnant. Investment in new technology improves productivity, but puts fewer people to work, and soon the greater productivity leads to more goods being produced than can be sold on the market. The capitalists are driven into ever sharper competition, which increases the war danger. Endless wars abroad have led to massive surveillance programs and the militarization even of the local police forces within the U.S. In the past few years, police repression has been viewed by millions on video as executions of people of color by the police reaches astounding levels. Police kill 1,000 people a year, disproportionately Black people. The extent of police militarization was shown to the world two years ago in Ferguson, Missouri, when armored cars, police and national guard forces carried assault weapons, wore body armor and gas masks to confront civilian populations protesting the police execution of a young Black man. The Black Lives Matter movement has continually exposed this systemic police violence. The U.S. prison population is by far the largest in the world, in total and in proportion to population, with more than 2.3 million people in prison and millions of others trapped in the injustice system. The repression and militarization intensify racism and permeate every aspect of life. Missing from the goals of the past and present U.N. summits is the concept that food, clean water, education and health care are basic rights of every person. Peace is the most essential right. The U.N.’s plans omit any mention of more equitable distribution. Past international conferences on reparations and debt cancelation have been pushed off today's U.N. agendas. The U.N. “millennium goals” have failed the world’s poor and primarily ended up helping the largest corporations reap more profits. U.N. summits—while promising global transformation—are part of the capitalists’ war on the world’s people. The accumulation of wealth and power has accelerated through these global initiatives because the largest corporations dominate the plans to privatize every essential social program. These are the same corporations and banks that profit from war and ever-increasing military contracts. The biggest banks, transnational companies and financial institutions, like the World Bank and International Monetary Fund, structure the U.N. projects while ignoring the massive destruction and dislocation of the wars. The objectives of the U.N. policy makers are to expand capitalist markets, maximize profits and restructure the developing countries more tightly into their economic web—not to redistribute the world’s wealth. Understanding the United States' relentless drive for war contributes to an understanding of why peace is continually threatened.

She helped coordinate International War Crimes Tribunals to document the U.S. premeditated destruction of Iraq and Yugoslavia.

Tory Bruno, ULA’s chief executive, urged the Air Force to postpone the deadline for bids, saying it should take time to explore the impact of SpaceX’s rocket failure while also taking into account the both companies’ experience and past performance. The Pentagon should have particular reservations, Bruno wrote, given that SpaceX has now had two of its Falcon 9 rockets blow up, which he said “serve as a reminder of the complexity and hazards intrinsic to space launch services.” “This strategy defies both law and logic and puts hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars and Warfighter mission needs unnecessarily at risk,” he wrote. Advertisement Continue reading The letter, a copy of which was obtained by The Washington Post, is the latest salvo in one of Washington’s most contentious contractor feuds, one that has pitted a pair of the world’s most powerful defense contractors against a brash billionaire, looking to shake up a calcified market by offering launches for far cheaper. And it’s the most glaring example yet of a competitor going after SpaceX for its pair of explosions. SpaceX and the Air Force did not immediately respond to requests for comment. For a decade, ULA, the joint venture between Lockheed Martin and Boeing, had a monopoly on launching national security satellites for the Pentagon. But then SpaceX, the hard-charging company founded by tech entrepreneur Elon Musk, sued the Air Force for the right to compete, saying it could save taxpayers millions of dollars. The parties settled, and last year the Air Force granted SpaceX the certification to compete, saying it had met its rigorous technical standards. ULA fired its chief executive and hired Bruno, who vowed to “literally transform the company” in order for it to compete against SpaceX, which had already won contracts from NASA to fly cargo and eventually astronauts to the International Space Station. But faced with competition for the first time, ULA declined to bid on the first of the contested contracts last year, saying among other things that the Air Force was giving too much weight to the price companies bid. The emphasis on price-and not experience and past performance-put ULA at a disadvantage, the company said. SpaceX then walked away with the $82.7 million contract, the first of nine launches to be competitively bid, at a price far less than the Air Force had been paying ULA in the past. Lt. Gen. Samuel Greaves cheered the service’s new partner, saying in a statement last month that the Air Force hopes “to continue fostering competition in order to promote innovation and reduce cost to the taxpayer while maintaining our laser focus on mission success.” But SpaceX has now had two of its rockets explode in spectacular fireballs, raising concerns about its reliability and safety. One of its rockets blew up last year while carrying $118 million worth of cargo to the space station. Earlier this month, a rocket blew up during fueling before an engine test and a $195 million satellite was destroyed. The Air Force is part of the investigation into the most recent failure, but officials have said the explosion has not affected SpaceX’s certification. Advertisement Continue reading In his letter to Air Force Secretary Deborah Lee James and Frank Kendall, the Pentagon’s chef weapons buyer, Bruno sought to contrast his company’s long record of accomplishment with the his relatively new competitor. He trumpeted ULA’s 111 consecutive successful launches on its Atlas and Delta rockets. And he wrote that the company has a long heritage of delivering “into precise orbits some of the most sensitive and valuable national security payloads directly supporting out country’s Warfighters-and it has done so with unprecedented dependability and mission success.” Focusing so heavily on price is only appropriate when the “risk of unsuccessful contract performance is minimal,” he wrote. And the recent SpaceX explosion, “reminds us that the risk associated with space launch service contracts is well beyond ‘minimal.'” The criteria used by the Air Force in the contract to launch its GPS III satellite “relegates technical performance to an afterthought, favoring price as the determining evaluation factor-a purchasing strategy befitting perhaps of basic commodity contracting services, not the ‘incredible challenge’ of spaceflight.” He urged the Air Force to push back the deadline for bids by 60 days so that it could “explore the nature and impact” of SpaceX’s failure and also ensure that it “adequately factors” criteria such as “reliability, schedule certainty and past performance.” And he hinted that the fight may not be over, saying ULA’s concerns “could conceivably be litigated in a courtroom.” Despite the plea, the Air Force proceeded with the bids, which were due Monday. This time, ULA said it submitted a bid. boeing-lockheed Share Tweet LinkedIn Print Subscribe More News Suggested Stories: SpaceX accident 'most difficult and complex' in its history – Sep 9, 2016 Investigation into rocket explosion just underway; SpaceX vows to return to flight in November – Sep 13, 2016 House Republicans cite concerns over SpaceX explosion – Sep 29, 2016 Lawmakers say SpaceX rocket explosion investigation should not be 'politicized' – Oct 4, 2016 Advertisement Comments Subscribe to the Journal for only $12.

It is an advanced version of the T-50 trainer aircraft. The T-50A prototype made its public appearance in December 2015. Lockheed Martin and KAI successfully conducted the maiden test flight of the first T-50A aircraft in June 2016. The second T-50A configured aircraft completed its first flight at Sacheon airfield in South Korea, in July 2016. Lockheed Martin opened a new ground-based training facility in Greenville, South Carolina, in August 2016, for the T-50A trainer and ground-based training system. The facility houses production equipment and systems to perform final assembly and flight operations of the T-50A trainer aircraft. T-X APT programme details The APT programme is intended to replace the ageing T-38 Talon jet trainers. The USAF plans to sign a contract for the acquisition of 350 T-Xs to replace the 431 T-38s. The USAF intends to issue a request for proposal for the T-X programme in December 2016. The new T-X trainer is anticipated to achieve initial operational capability by 2024. Other contenders for the T-X programme include the Boeing / Saab team, and Northrop Grumman, which are offering new designs for the T-X requirements, and the Raytheon / Leonardo team, who are proposing a mature aircraft design for the competition.

See all suppliers T-50A design and features The T-50A features a blended wing-fuselage with horizontal and vertical stabilisers. It is purpose-built to meet the training requirements of fifth-generation fighters such as F-22 Raptor and F-35 Lightning II. The under-fuselage incorporates a retractable tricycle-type landing gear. The T-50A is designed to offer fighter-like performance and characteristics to eliminate pilot training gaps between the current trainer fleet and fifth-generation fighters. Cockpit and avionics The T-50A trainer integrates a modern, full-glass cockpit housing an instructor and a student in tandem seating layout. Each seat can accommodate personnel weighing between 53kg and 99kg. "The T-50A is designed to offer fighter-like performance and characteristics to eliminate pilot training gaps between the current trainer fleet and fifth-generation fighters." The anthropometrically designed, fifth-generation cockpit integrates a large-screen display, digital flight controls / fly-by-wire, and next-generation air traffic management systems. It is also equipped with an onboard oxygen generating system and an environmental control system. The T-50A is an easy-to-fly aircraft such as the F-16, F-22 and F-35 fighters. Its resemblance with other fifth-generation aircraft eliminates negative training and unneeded operational flights, resulting in faster and more cost-effective training missions that enable student pilots to concentrate on their aviation skills. Details of Lockheed Martin's ground-based training system (GBTS) The ground-based training system (GBTS) comprises a range of innovative technologies to provide options for transferring aircraft training tasks into the simulation. The system implements cutting-edge technologies based on the lessons learned from decades of training with evolving technologies. The synchronised GBTS from Lockheed Martin also maximises training effectiveness, while minimising costs. It prepares the next-generation of pilots to operate next-generation aircraft. T-50A engine power The T-50A is powered by a single General Electric F404 turbofan engine equipped with full-authority digital engine control (FADEC) system. The power-plant integrates three-staged fans, seven-stage axial arrangement and an afterburner. The T-50A has the ability to fly at a supersonic speed of Mach 1.5 and can attain a range of more than 1,850km.

Tags: Iran, Aviation, Plane, Airbus, Boeing, Deal, Sanctions, Nuclear Deal, Business, US Airbus said on Wednesday it had obtained a first license from the United States to supply passenger jets to Iran, a key step towards fulfilling a multi-billion-dollar deal. Airbus reached the deal in January to sell Iran 118 aircraft but it required approval from the US Office of Foreign Assets Control because some of the planes' components are made in the United States. "Airbus applied for two licenses and the first one was granted yesterday night. We expect the second license to be granted in the coming weeks," an Airbus spokesman said. Airbus said it had been cleared to transfer 17 planes to Iran Air. Some of those deliveries may occur as early as this year, the spokesman added. The deal was initially valued at $25 billion (22.4 billion euros) but Iranian officials say it is worth nearer $10 billion. In June, Iran reached an arrangement with American aerospace giant Boeing to purchase 100 aircraft. In reference to Wednesday's announcement, Airbus rival Boeing said, “We believe their license application was submitted prior to our similar request and that the government follows a ‘first in, first out’ policy. We look forward to receiving our license from the government shortly.” Many of Iran's ageing civil aviation fleet are in desperate need of replacement. Parts and servicing remained nearly impossible to get while the world sanctioned Iran over its nuclear programme. But a nuclear deal struck this year with six world powers, including the US, has lifted some of the economic sanctions on Iran in return for limits on the Islamic Republic's contested atomic programme.

Giving Wings to Africa’s Regional Integration Tuesday, 20 September 2016 19:00 by Carlos Lopes Kigali: As the world gets used to new forms of interconnectedness, Africa is not left aside. Today, more than 700 million Africans are subscribed to mobile services with many wealthy Africans proudly displaying more than one cell, a symbol of a newly acquired social status, according to the Secretairy General of  ECA, Carlos Lopes . The proliferation of mobile networks has transformed communications, businesses or banking, enabling a jump unimaginable just a few years ago. Thanks to technology we are witnessing new forms of integration.  Is aviation going to be the next big integration magnet? Unfortunately, even though Africa is home to 15% of the world’s population it only accounts for a relatively small proportion of air traffic, in fact less than 3% of the world’s total.  Small as this may be, the African aviation market is growing fast. International air passenger numbers have grown consistently year on year since 2004 except in 2011 where the numbers dipped as a result of political instability in parts of North Africa. From less than 40 million passengers carried in 2004 by African airlines, passenger numbers increased to 73.8 million in 2013. Domestic passenger numbers within the region also increased significantly reaching 28 million in 2013. This growth is projected to continue. Boeing’s long term forecast for 2014-2033 indicates that, driven by a positive economic outlook, increasing trade links, and the growing middle class, traffic to, from, and within Africa is projected to grow by about 6 percent per year for the next two decades. This demand will translate into a demand for an additional 1,170 new airplanes, valued at USD 160 billion. But as with all good things the proof of the pudding is in the eating. According to the Air Transport Action Group, in 2014 the aviation industry in Africa supported 6.8 million jobs and contributed USD 72.5 billion to Africa’s GDP. This accounted for 11% of the jobs and 3% of the GDP supported by the air transport industry worldwide. These encouraging developments however do not reveal some of the major obstacles still faced by the aviation industry in the continent. It remains one of the most unsafe regions to fly, it has lagged behind others on skies liberalization, its airport infrastructure continues to require massive investments and the training of skilled personnel is not being properly planned. African airlines consolidation is another challenge. During the 1970s and 1980s there were about 36 African airlines of which 26 had intercontinental flight services. Today there are only about 12 African airlines with intercontinental operations.  Over the last two decades a total of 37 new airlines were launched in Africa but almost all of them failed.  Most countries continues to act solo and motivated by choices other than economic. We continue to see attempts to create or sustain national carriers, opposing international trends. It is true that Middle East carriers and the good performance of Ethiopian Airlines contradict the doomsayers of state-owned airlines, but these are exceptions that need to be understood in their plenitude. 80% of the continent’s long haul traffic is dominated by non-African carriers. The average cost of a flight in Africa is higher than anywhere else in the world.  High landing fees, exorbitant taxes levied on airfares as well as above average aviation fuel prices, almost 30% higher than in Europe, do not help. Funding access for the aviation industry is uneven. Dubai, Abu Dhabi and Qatar-based airlines have reportedly enjoyed a host of benefits valued at more than USD 42 billion over the past decade. That includes subsidized access to capital and sponsored first class infrastructure. American commercial aviation has also benefited from its government’s support valued at USD 155 billion, since 1918. Obviously African airlines are not in the same league and have been left to fend for themselves. Without the same easy access to capital markets, export credit financing (which can cover up to 85% of the actual aircraft price), or insurance subsidies, African airlines either have to finance the difference from their own funds or opt for junior loans with punitive rates from commercial banks; or lease aircrafts at an even heavier cost. The financing options open to African carriers dwarf their chances for expansion. It is therefore hardly surprising mega carriers are doing so well, including in their operations in Africa. They have the advantage to expand quickly, with space to build a market from scratch, increase market shares and continue investing heavily in service and marketing. Intra –African connectivity is so mediocre that any passengers have to travel thousands of miles out of the continent just to be able to make a connection to another African destination. A quarter of the intra-African routes are actually served by just one airline. Despite African states signing up for a full liberalization of the regional market at Yamoussoukro in 1999, restrictions and protectionism instead of being eliminated are becoming rather rampant. What could constitute a good base for a turnaround? With regards to safety accidents 2014 marked a significant change. Despite aviation disasters dominating headlines that year, African airlines actually stood out for zero jet hull losses (write-offs) per 1-million flights compared to 2.22 in 2013 and 4.63 in 2012. This is encouraging news, suggesting regional measures to improve safety records are working. Ethiopian Airlines is already leading the way amongst its continental competitors in terms of establishing ambitious targets meet them and turn a profit. With 93 destinations across 5 continents, including 53 in Africa its future looks promising. Having experienced a phenomenal 700% growth in its revenue since 2005, Ethiopian Airlines has demonstrated the strength to face difficult competition. However, as long as Africa fails to establish a single aviation market and countries continue to restrict African carriers while welcoming the European and Middle East competitors, the performance of Ethiopian Airlines may remain an exception. Africa must move towards embracing a conducive and smart regulatory framework that liberalises its skies in order to realise a profitable and globally competent airline industry. A truly competitive sector will need to be innovative and prioritise the continent’s interests over national flags. An open skies policy would drive the cost of tickets down and increase substantially the number of flyers.  According to IATA by just deregulating and liberating African air services in 12 key markets, an extra 155,000 jobs and USD 1.3 billion could be generated. Evidence shows that open skies agreements have worked in other regions. For example in Europe, it increased exponentially the number of routes and provoked a 34% decline in ticket fares. Indeed where African nations have liberalised their air markets, either within Africa or with the rest of the world, positive benefits have resulted. For example the agreement of a more liberal air market between South Africa and Kenya in the early 2000s led to a 69% rise in passenger traffic. The 2006 Morocco-EU open skies agreement led to 160% rise in traffic with the number of routes operating between the two multiplying four fold[6]. Just allowing the operation of a low cost carrier service between South Africa and Zambia (Johannesburg-Lusaka) resulted in a 38% reduction in fares and 38% increase in passenger traffic. The continent has to create more space for low cost flying.  As of 2013 the penetration of low-cost airlines in Africa was the lowest in the world, representing less than 10% of the continent’s total. In an interconnected world, air travel is no longer a luxury, it is a necessity for a prosperous continent. < Prev   Next >   Most Popular President Kagame presides over signing of Imihigo 2016-2017 Inauguration of the Julius Nyerere Peace and Security Building Le deuxième avion Boeing 737-800 Next Generation du Rwanda est arrivé à Kigali Tour du Rwanda 2016: Thimothy Rugg gagne la troisième étape La CNLG a entamé une campagne de sensibilisation dans les camps des TIG Main Menu Front Page National Regional Business Politics Sports Health Economy Opinion Search this site 2010 Elections Contact Us Grands Lacs Hebdo CRID How to Subscribe How to Advertise Jobs Administrator .

REUTERS/Morteza Nikoubazl By Tim Hepher and Alwyn Scott | PARIS/NEW YORK PARIS/NEW YORK The United States has begun unblocking deals by Western giants to sell jetliners to Iran in a move likely to ease complaints from Tehran over implementation of last year's sanctions deal, but test conservative opposition to the deals in both nations. Europe's Airbus (AIR.PA) said on Wednesday it had received U.S. Treasury approval to begin exporting jets to Iran, under a deal for more than 100 jets struck in January. Hours later, its U.S. rival Boeing (BA.N), which had been behind Airbus in the line for permits because its matching deal for over 100 jets came six months later, said it had received a sales license and remained in talks with IranAir. [nL2N1BX1TJ] The U.S. Treasury confirmed issuing two licenses. The move removes a key hurdle to one of the most high-profile deals between Iran and foreign companies since last year's agreement between Tehran and world powers to open up trade in exchange for curbs on the country's nuclear activities. But major questions remain over the financing of deals between Iran and Western planemakers that threaten to obstruct deliveries of the planes, in what is seen as a test case for Western trade and investment following the nuclear deal. "This sends a strong signal but it resolves only half the problem. The challenge to raise financing remains," Bertrand Grabowski, a managing director at German's DVB Bank, said. Foreign banks are reluctant to finance the aircraft deals, fearing they could fall foul of remaining U.S. sanctions that prohibit the use of its financial system for Iranian business, something difficult to avoid in a complex global supply chain. With U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump strongly critical of the rapprochement, some banks fear they could be left with no insurance if Iran sanctions "snap back". The deals by Airbus and Boeing to sell or lease over 200 jets to flag carrier IranAir would help modernize and expand the country's elderly fleet, held together by smuggled or improvised parts after years of sanctions. But nine months after the first deal was signed, Iranian officials had voiced growing concerns about what they saw as unfair delays in obtaining U.S. licenses or clarity over banking and financing rules. Tehran's deputy roads and urban development minister told the CAPA Iran Aviation Finance Summit in Tehran this week that failing to clear the jet sales would put Washington in "breach" of the nuclear pact. OPPOSITION TO DEALS Diplomats say the new jets will allow pragmatist President Hassan Rouhani to argue the sanctions deal is working, several months ahead of Iranian presidential elections in May next year. But the deals remain strongly opposed by U.S. Republicans who say the jets could be misused for military purposes and by conservatives in Iran who oppose the country's more open stance and say the purchases will not benefit most Iranians. As the Obama administration moved to begin allowing the sales, Republicans blasted U.S. policy toward Iran. Paul Ryan, Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, said the administration “bends over backwards” to help Iran. Airbus said it had been granted an initial license to supply 17 A320 or A330 jets that are slated for early delivery, and that it expected a second license for remaining jets in weeks. An Iranian official told Reuters this week a deal for 118 Airbus jets had been trimmed by six amid regulatory delays, and that a deal to buy or lease 109 Boeing aircraft, including 80 purchased directly, had been shaved to 108. Iran has also ordered up to 40 Franco-Italian ATR (AIR.PA) SIFI.MI turboprop planes needing U.S. approval.

Courtney Davis, Howard University News Service Leave a comment   By Courtney Davis Howard University News Service The National African American Museum of History and Culture, scheduled to open this weekend to much fanfare and huge crowds, seems to have something for everyone –black and white, young and old, rich and poor. For Remi Maarouf, who visited last Saturday as part of a special preview, the shards of glass from the 1963 16th Street Baptist Church bombing that claimed four black girls, struck particularly hard. The exhibit that included Resurrection City, a tent community erected on the National Mall in 1968 as part of the Poor People’s March that the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. planned but never lived to see, brought back special memories for Augusta Wills. Niyah Boney, a Washington 9th grader, said it was more recent history, the Black Lives Matter pieces, that resonated with him. Maarouf, Wills and Boney were among scores of a special group of Washington-area donors to the museum who visited the facility last weekend. Hundreds more who have visited the museum in recent weeks — from President Barack Obama to Olympian Simone Biles to 85-year-old Mary Smith of Charleston, S.C. – have said they were moved by what they saw. More of a narrative than a museum, the facility’s curators say, the exhibits are placed in a way that tells the story of African Americans from the beginning. The story begins 70 feet below the ground at the bottom level across three exhibits — “Slavery and Freedom,” “Defending Freedom, Defining Freedom: Era of Segregation 1876-1968” and “A Changing America: 1968 and Beyond” – and works its way up to the top of the five-story building. Museum visitors can see pieces of a Portuguese slave ship, a slave cabin, a Boeing aircraft used to train Tuskegee Airmen, a lunch counter stool from the Greensboro sit-ins, the couch and a dress worn by Oprah on the Oprah Winfrey Show. There is Michael Jackson’s hat and jacket from his “Victory” tour, Harriett Tubman’s Shawl, Muhammed Ali’s boxing gear, Emmitt Till’s coffin, Chuck Berry’s red Cadillac Eldorado, Carl Lewis’ Olympic medals and hundreds more pieces of black history. Gloria Snipes, who visited from Portsmouth, Va., last weekend, found the slavery exhibits the most thought-provoking. “I thought about all the blacks who were from Africa that were torn away from their families and having to endure a trip on the ocean in the hull of a ship,” Snipes said. “It was moving to see the chains that were used to enslave people.” Snipes and her husband were among the thousands of African Americans, other individuals and corporations who made financial contributions or donated rare items so the museum could exist. Oprah Winfrey, for example, donated $12 million. NBA legend Michael Jordan and BET founder Robert Johnson are among those who each gave more than $5 million. Anthony Welters and his wife, U.S. Ambassador Beatrice Welters, gifted $2 million and the more than 100 individuals and institutions. like Alfred Street Baptist Church of Alexandria, Va., donated $1 million or more. Then there are the thousands of others, charter members, who gave smaller donations and reached into their closets and donated some of the tens of thousands of exhibits. After finishing the tour Saturday, Kecia Wills of Washington said she likes how the museum is structured. “Starting from the bottom, it gives you a feeling of being in the bottom of a slave ship,” Wills said. “It’s dark, a little tight and as you go up the floors are wider. There is more space and more air. It just shows the whole cultural experience of black people once we weren’t slaves anymore.” The third level of the museum is home to what’s called the Community Galleries, which chronicle African Americans and sports, the military, the great migration from the South and the ways black people created opportunities for themselves, from collegiate Greek life to Hip-Hop music. The Culture Galleries on the fourth floor — “Musical Crossroads,” “Cultural Expressions,” “Visual Arts Gallery,” and “Taking the Stage” — feature a modern art gallery, Chuck Berry’s 1973 Cadillac and an interactive beat production video. Augusta Wills of Washington said the exhibit she identified with most was “A Changing America,” because it included Resurrection City. She was there. “I’d get a chance to come down and talk to people who were occupying the tent city,” Wills recalled. “So, that exhibit was my favorite in terms of something I really identified with.” Remi Maarouf, who is white, said seeing historical pieces live gave the artifacts a greater meaning to him. “You see things in textbooks and you read about things, like the church bombing,” he said. “To see the shards of glass from the church window, things like that. was just kind of incredible.” His friend, Scott Ackiss, agreed. “You read about all these individual events, but to see it all from one perspective,” said Ackiss, who is also white. “I didn’t get the feeling of an African American. You kind of tune that out and see the larger story being told.” Niyah Boney, 14, took particular interest in the sign used to protest the death of Trayvon Martin, an unarmed black 17-year-old, by a self-appointed security officer in Sanford, Fla., part of an exhibit about Black Lives Matter. “I felt like I actually witnessed something that was in there, a part of history,” he said. The museum’s senior curator of history, William Pretzer, said the facility is more than a place where people can view or relive the past. “We want this to be a place where we can talk about what, in America is a topic that we don’t talk honestly enough about, and that’s race,” Pretzer said. “Without being angry, without being sensitive, with everyone trying to understand everyone else’s point of view, we can move to a kind of interaction around issues that involve race.” Ron Lewis visited from Northern Virginia. Lewis said despite all of the horror and heartbreak that were part of the museum’s exhibits, he left with a good feeling. “The last 50 years we’ve made tremendous progress,” he said. “You have a lot more people able to live the American dream and they all look like us. It makes you feel good. “It makes you hopeful.” Also On The Michigan Chronicle: comments – Add Yours Your browser does not support iframes.

The airline had stopped its Mumbai-Brussels-Newark flight in March. “Any specific addition to the network will be communicated at the appropriate time,” a Jet Airways spokesperson said in response to questions over the airline’s US plans. Sources said the airline was considering reconfiguring some of its Boeing 777 aircraft in order to fly non-stop to New York. Air India and United have non-stop flights to the US. Air India recently increased the frequency of its Delhi-San Francisco flight to six times a week. Air India also flies non-stop to New York, Newark and Chicago and is planning a service to Washington. United flies from Newark to Delhi and Mumbai. Jet Airways offers connection to the US through its code-share partners over Abu Dhabi (Etihad), Amsterdam (Delta) and London (United). The airline has over 14 per cent of India's foreign air traffic and international operations contribute to around half its revenue. “I see a possible reset in the Jet-Etihad partnership and new alignments emerging. Amsterdam will be a key hub for Jet Airways’ North American operations,” said Kapil Kaul, CEO (South Asia) of consultancy CAPA. Jet Airways was supposed to introduce flights to New York, Chicago and Newark via Abu Dhabi as a part of an agreement it signed with Etihad in 2013. Instead of launching flights, Jet Airways leased its Boeing 777s to Etihad for use on its flights to New York and San Francisco.

The space agency is joining together large elements of the rocket’s 212-foot-tall core stage, the backbone of the SLS rocket at the Michoud Assembly facility in New Orleans. Engineers just completed welding the liquid hydrogen tank that will provide fuel for the first SLS flight in 2018. Photo coutresy of NASA/Michoud/Steven Seipel The SLS rocket was designed to support missions to the moon starting in 2018 as well as house large hardware like landers, habitats and supplies needed to travel extensive distances to explore places like Mars and other deep space destinations. The Mars rocket is powered by a core stage that carries 2.3 million lbs of liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen to fuel the four RS-25 engines. Engineers have recently finished welding the largest part of the core stage, the 130-foot-tall liquid hydrogen tank that will provide fuel for the first flight. “Building the core stage is similar to building a house,” said Joan Funk, SLS core stage lead at NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama. After all the foundation elements are in place, engineers will clean and prime each element before beginning the internal integration. Michoud’s Vertical Assembly Center is welding many of the core stage’s main elements including the forward skirt, the liquid oxygen tank, the liquid hydrogen tank and the engine section. The core stage’s fifth element, the intertank, which is bolted, is also being built at Michoud. Boeing is building the core stage, but to build the stage, the aerospace giant has worked with 442 businesses across America, including 297 small businesses. After construction, each element within the rocket will undergo extensive testing. Wet structures — elements that hold fuel, or the liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen tanks — are put through “proof tests” to assure manufacturing quality. The liquid oxygen tank is hydrostatically tested and filled with water; and the liquid hydrogen tank is pneumatically tested. Once tested, all the structural elements are constructed to enable engineers to assemble the “brains” rocket. In the SLS’s core stage, 45 miles of wire cabling carry power and data from element to element powering flight computers, cameras, sensors, avionics and other electronics housed in the dry structures. The core stage’s plumbing contains lines that deliver the propellant and oxidizer from the tanks to the engines. Each dry structure also contains purge vent lines and hazardous gas lines designed to eliminate dangerous gases building up in the dry structures prior to launch. Racks, cameras, sensors, vent lines, wire cabling, valves, shelves, couplings, and more fill the core stage’s dry structures to near capacity. After this is complete, the dry structures are ready to be joined to other elements. The liquid oxygen tank is the second tank that makes up the core stage, which towers more than 200 feet tall with a diameter of 27.6 feet. Photo coutresy of NASA/Michoud/Steven Seipel Before this happens, though, insulation is applied. NASA’s thermal protection system give the rocket its signature orange color, but more importantly, it protects the core stage from the extreme temperatures encountered during launch and maintains the fuels’ extremely low temperatures. The liquid hydrogen is chilled to minus 423 degrees Fahrenheit and the liquid oxygen is chilled to minus 297 degrees. Each section is then stacked vertically, with elements bolted to one another using segmented support rings welded to each element, providing stiffness. The liquid hydrogen tank sits atop the engine section to create the aft section, and the forward skirt and intertank are bolted to the top and bottom of the liquid oxygen tank to create the forward section. Engineers are responsible for moving the elements into a horizontal position for final assembly. Final wiring, plumbing and insulation are installed after the forward section is joined to the aft to complete the core stage assembly. The core stage is set to travel to NASA’s Stennis Space Center near Bay St. Louis, Mississippi, where it will undergo testing called a “green run.” A green run, or the first time the engines are assembled into a single configuration with the core stage and fired at nearly full-power, tests the compatibility and functionality of the system to ensure a safe and viable design. Once testing is complete, the core stage will head to NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida, for its first flight with Orion. www.nasa.gov Share Tweet Facebook LinkedIn Google+ Tags NASA rocket Related Blue Origin successfully launches and lands reusable rocket NASA Improves Solar Electric Propulsion for Space Exploration NASA robotic arm precisely installing Webb Telescope mirrors Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

The U.S. Treasury has issued licences allowing the export of some European Airbus jets to Iran and is expected to start approving sales of Boeing jets within days, the sources said. A spokesman for Airbus confirmed it had received a U.S. licence covering a total of 17 aircraft slated for early delivery. Although based in Europe, Airbus needs U.S. approval because of the high number of U.S. parts in its jets. Both planemakers have agreed to sell or lease more than 100 aircraft each to flag carrier IranAir as Iran rebuilds its aviation sector following last year's agreement between Tehran and major powers over the lifting of nuclear-related sanctions.

It was quite a journey. Over a ten-day span, we visited four NASA field sites and two major Space Launch System contractors, after watching the OSIRIS-REx spacecraft blast off on a seven-year journey to collect a sample from a near-Earth asteroid.  We spent hours on the road verbally processing everything we were seeing, debating some important questions: Will SLS be financially feasible? Is NASA's legacy Apollo and Shuttle infrastructure a burden, or an asset? How much muffuletta can one consume and still be fresh for a post-lunch interview? Our trip took the better part of a year to plan. We are eternally grateful to our members, who financially supported this ambitious reporting endeavor, as well as our colleagues at The Planetary Society and the dozens of folks across NASA and its suppliers who granted us the access we requested to make this trip a reality.  So what did we learn? A lot—the entire experience was a bit like drinking from a fire hose. We'll be sorting through our material for quite some time to incorporate it into written pieces, a video for our Horizon Goal series, and new episodes of The Space Advocate. But in the short term, I wanted to capture a few key thoughts swirling in my brain and wrangle them into a coherent article. So, without further ado, here are five things we learned from our #RocketRoadTrip. Want more pictures? Check out our Flickr album for all the highlights. Jason Davis / The Planetary Society Exploration Mission 1 Orion flight spacecraft The Orion EM-1 flight unit at Kennedy Space Center. 1. It's happening. SLS has been more than a PowerPoint rocket for quite some time. But in order to get the vehicle and Orion off the ground in 2018, there is now a sustained buzz of activity across all of NASA's southern centers.  At Kennedy Space Center, more than half of the massive SLS access platforms are installed in the Vehicle Assembly Building. During previous visits, I've been allowed to peek into the actual SLS high bay, but not this time—it's currently an active construction site, with sparks from welders' torches visible in one direction, and ceiling cranes on the move in the other. Out at launch pad 39B, the spic-and-span flame trench I saw last year is now cluttered with scaffolding, as workers install new heat-resistant bricks. The managers are busy, too. In Marshall Space Flight Center director Todd May's office, the chime of incoming emails frequently interrupted our conversation. On a white board in SLS chief engineer Garry Lyles' office, hastily scribbled "Notes from Gerst" (Bill Gerstenmaier, associate administrator for NASA's human spaceflight division) overlooked stacks of notebooks on Lyles' desk. In a John Henry-esque moment, conversations with managers at Marshall were drowned out by a worker swinging a massive hammer at a pylon underneath the SLS hydrogen tank test platform. Down at Stennis Space Center, it was just plain hard to hear anything at test stand B-2, where workers are preparing to host the SLS core stage for an all-up test firing. Inside a high bay at the Michoud Assembly Facility, our video interviews with director Bobby Watkins were interrupted by a jackhammering worker preparing a stand for the Exploration Upper Stage, which will fly on the second SLS mission. (The workers politely stopped for a moment, resulting in jokes that an EUS delay can now be blamed on The Planetary Society.) One Boeing floor manager we interviewed at Michoud said she had recently been pulling 12-hour shifts.  For the first time since the cancellation of the Constellation program, NASA's human spaceflight program seems to have regained momentum. It appears poised to have the necessary political support, too. The latest NASA authorization bill introduced by the Senate specifically endorses SLS and Mars (and would authorize a hefty $500 million increase above last year’s spending), while current presidential frontrunner Hillary Clinton appears to support the Obama administration's humans-to-Mars plans.  However… 2. The margin left on the 2018 SLS launch deadline is now razor-thin. Have you ever reached the point in a large project where all remaining items on your to-do list become equally important, forcing you to shift into a work-hard-until-it-all-gets-done kind of mentality? That seems to be where the SLS, Orion and ground systems programs are. NASA's official stance is that SLS will be ready to fly in November 2018. But the agency continues to work internally toward a September 2018 goal.  That's just two years from now. Here's a very broad overview of what has to happen between now and then: Michoud must complete the core stage liquid oxygen tank, bolt it to the just-finished hydrogen tank and the (under construction) intertank section, add the engine section (which still needs engines from Stennis), spray the tanks with foam, and ship the whole thing to Stennis for the aforementioned test-firing at the (almost completed) B-2 test stand. The core stage then ships to Kennedy Space Center, where it will be mated to the solid rocket boosters on the (almost ready) mobile launcher in the (getting close to finished) Vehicle Assembly Building. The off-the-shelf second stage will be added, as well as Orion, which is still mostly a pressure vessel shell at the moment. And there's also the Orion service module, which needs to be completed by the European Space Agency. The flame trench at pad 39B must be finished, along with all of the mobile launcher umbilical connections and pad infrastructure. NASA also has to finish and test all associated software, including SLS avionics and ground systems monitoring.  In the meantime, engineers have to finish poking and prodding all the SLS and Orion qualification test articles and rocket pieces to make sure their flight counterparts are cleared to fly. Nothing major can go wrong. There can be no problems that would cause major delays. And keep in mind the last time humanity launched a rocket this powerful was 1973.  Jason Davis / The Planetary Society Some assembly required Four RS-25 flight engines, like the one shown at top, will be turned upside down and mounted to the rocket's engine section (middle) using the white pins (bottom). The engine is currently stored at Aerojet Rocketdyne's facility at Stennis Space Center, Mississippi, but will be mounted to the SLS hardware at the Michoud Assembly Facility in New Orleans. 3. SLS is staggeringly large. Our timing at the Michoud Assembly Facility could not have been better. We managed to see both the completed hydrogen tank test article, which will be shipped up to Marshall Space Flight Center for stress testing, as well as the identical flight article, which just received its final welds in the Vertical Assembly Center the night before. Pictures of the hydrogen tank do not do it justice. It's the same width as a space shuttle external fuel tank (8.4 meters), but longer (64.6 versus 46.8 meters). And that's just one piece of the rocket—the first assembled SLS-Orion stack will stand just shy of 100 meters tall. Are you are old enough to have seen a Saturn V moon rocket in person? If not, have you met someone who has? Or perhaps you've visited one of the three remaining flight vehicles at Kennedy Space Center, Marshall Space Flight Center or Johnson Space Center? If so, you'll probably agree that the mammoth Saturn V was a once-in-a-generation rocket, rivaled only by the space shuttle, that helped inspire an entire generation of engineers, scientists and space fans. The Space Launch System has the potential to follow that lineage. 4. Building staggeringly large rockets requires staggeringly large—and complex—infrastructure. This was my third visit to Michoud Assembly Facility. And only on this third visit have I truly started to comprehend how difficult it is to build a rocket on this scale. The factory floor—43 acres under one roof—is filled with gigantic, one-of-a-kind welding tools that had to be created specifically for SLS and Orion. The rocket is so big that engineers worry about the fuel tanks sagging when placed on their sides. Every part of the building process presents unique logistical challenges, right down to procuring enough transport carts and deciding on a safe flooring surface. (We heard a fascinating story about a heavy lift cart that built up enough static electricity to give an unsuspecting engineer quite a powerful jolt.) Carl Sagan once said that if you wish to make an apple pie from scratch, you have to invent the universe. Likewise, to build a giant rocket, you must first invent the tools and facilities necessary to build that rocket. Last Monday, in an email to select media representatives, Jeff Bezos revealed Blue Origin's New Glenn rocket system. At 7 meters in diameter, it will be larger than any rocket flying today and just 1.4 meters shy of the diameter of the Space Launch System.  Blue Origin’s announcement was low on details, and we probably won't find out more specifics anytime soon, given the company’s aura of secrecy and its history of granting exclusive access to just a small cadre of reporters. So, as the Blue Origin concept was revealed, we were getting a direct, on-the-record look at what NASA, Aerojet Rocketdyne and Teledyne Brown Engineering are doing to build a heavy lift rocket. (Aerojet's only condition was having an ITAR officer accompany us to ensure we didn't capture any export-controlled footage, such as a close-up of the RS-68 engine.) Bezos says the New Glenn will fly by the end of the decade, four years from now. If it does, that'll be quite a triumph for Blue Origin, considering it took NASA seven years to fly SLS—even with the benefit of existing shuttle facilities and the flight-proven RS-25 engine. If Blue Origin is committed to New Glenn, they probably know what they’re getting into in terms of the infrastructure required to build such a massive rocket. Elon Musk and SpaceX are in the same situation with their yet-to-be-announced launcher that Musk wants to use to send colonists to Mars. The point? It doesn't matter whether you're a large government contractor like Boeing, a hip startup like SpaceX or a secretive firm like Blue Origin—at the end of the day, building a heavy lift rocket requires tools and processes right on the edge of what's theoretically possible, and the work takes place in cavernous factories surrounded by highly skilled workers. Space, as we're so often reminded, is hard. Jason Davis / The Planetary Society Completed SLS flight hydrogen tank The completed SLS hydrogen tank for Exploration Mission 1 sits in the Vertical Assembly Center at the Michoud Assembly Facility in New Orleans. The tank measures 8.4 by 64.6 meters, yet the entire vehicle stack will be almost 100 meters tall. 5. SLS and Orion generate American jobs. A large area of emphasis for this trip was investigating the impact SLS and NASA's southern field sites have on the economy. In Alabama alone, the Space Launch System supports about 13,000 jobs and generates $2.4 billion in economic output. (We're currently working with NASA to get more complete data from all of the centers we visited.) Here's one interesting case study from our visit to Teledyne Brown Engineering in Huntsville. Teledyne has been a key Marshall Space Flight Center contractor since Wernher von Braun roamed the countryside there during the Apollo era.  Among other things, Teledyne is currently building the Launch Vehicle Stage Adapter, a giant cone that connects the SLS upper stage to Orion. That contract alone is worth $60 million.  At Teledyne, we asked for a list of the company's subcontractors working on SLS-related projects, and within minutes, received an Excel spreadsheet printout with the names of 62 companies around the U.S. There's even one in my home state of West Virginia! Later, at Michoud, we asked a Boeing representative for the same information, and were told there are Boeing SLS subcontractors in 49 U.S. states. (We jokingly pressed them to confess which state has been left out—word has it that it's North Dakota.) So, though Boeing is a large, old-school conglomerate that earns a lot of government dollars off a Congressionally mandated rocket, a lot of that trickles down to mom-and-pop shops around the country. Some NASA observers bemoan SLS and many aspects of the agency a mere jobs program. But these jobs aren’t abstractions; they’re a mix of blue and white collar jobs, many of which are involved in high-end manufacturing, which is an area of emphasis for both political parties in the U.S. It can be argued, then, that the SLS workforce helps ensure widespread, personal support for NASA’s big goals, including the Journey to Mars. My wife's grandfather worked for a machine shop in New York City that once manufactured parts for the Apollo Lunar Module. It's a piece of our family lore, and was one of his favorite stories—we even have blueprints to corroborate the story.  That's it for now. Thanks again for joining us on our #RocketRoadTrip!   See other posts from September 2016   Read more blog entries about: Horizon Goal Comments: Karen: 09/26/2016 09:52 CDT "5. SLS and Orion generate American jobs." Well, yes, in the same way that hiring a lot of people to create a Burj Dubai-sized statue of Kim Kardaschian would generate American jobs, "a mix of blue and white collar jobs, many of which are involved in high-end manufacturing". The appropriate measure is not whether something generates jobs, but how well money is being spent. What do you get out of the labour of those people? You could hire them to rake piles of leaves back and forth all day if you didn't care what you got out of it. The question is, for this vast amount of money, do we want all of these peoples' labour dedicated toward SLS, or other equivalent-priced endeavours that yield more than a single megarocket of dubous sustainability in terms of launch costs.

Henderson, Purdue University Date of Award Fall 2014 Degree Type Thesis Degree Name Master of Science (MS) Department Aeronautics and Astronautics First Advisor Steven P. Schneider Committee Member 1 John P. Sullivan Committee Member 2 Patrick E. Rodi Abstract Experiments on a sharp 7-degree cone at low angles of attack were conducted at Mach 6 to understand the stationary and traveling modes of crossflow disturbances, the interaction between them, and the development of other instabilities that can lead to transition. Using the Boeing/AFOSR Mach-6 Quiet Tunnel (BAM6QT), pressure and temperature measurements were collected to better describe crossflow characteristics. Noisy and quiet flow conditions were compared to understand crossflow development. Temperature Sensitive Paint (TSP) was used to measure the global surface temperatures on the model. Schmidt-Boelter (SB) gauges were used to convert the surface temperatures to heat transfer. The global heat transfer then allowed the stationary crossflow to be visualized and quantified in terms of heat flux. Integrating heat fluxes azimuthally, the amplitudes of the stationary crossflow vortices were compared against the amplitudes of the traveling waves. PCB 132A31 and Kulite XCQ-062-15A transducers were used to measure pressure fluctuations over a broad range of frequencies. The traveling crossflow instability, the second-mode instability, and possibly the secondary-instability of the stationary crossflow mode were found at certain tunnel conditions. A grouping of Kulites was used to determine traveling wave speed and direction. Roughness elements were added to the model to excite discrete stationary vortices. The roughness elements provided a method to alter the strength of the stationary vortices. This technique allowed traveling-mode amplitudes to be compared to varying stationary-mode amplitudes Recommended Citation Henderson, Ryan O., "Crossflow Transition At Mach 6 On A Cone At Low Angles Of Attack" (2014).

The 10-year, $38 billion agreement, signed on Sept. 15 after a year of negotiations, comes into effect in U.S. fiscal year 2019. It constitutes the most military assistance Washington has ever provided to an ally, but was clinched only after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu accepted concessions. Key among those is the gradual phasing out of a clause allowing Israel to spend 26.3 percent of the funds on its own defence sector, which competes actively with U.S. firms such as Boeing, Lockheed Martin, General Dynamics and Raytheon. That means Israeli defence companies will miss out on up to $10 billion that might otherwise have been spent on home-made drones, missiles, tanks and other equipment, depending on the precise terms of the phase-out, which remain unclear. Once that phase-out is completed, all the funds in the agreement will have to be spent in the United States. "It's quite a problem," said one Israeli defence industry official, who asked not to be named because of the sensitivity of the issue. "The bigger companies and most advanced ones with the best technology and capabilities will be able to survive, but the smaller you are, the bigger the problem is." Netanyahu's office declined to comment on the domestic consequences of the aid deal but has said the agreement "will greatly strengthen the security of Israel". Israel has about 700 defence-related firms, most of them with only 50 to 150 employees. They mainly act as subcontractors to Israel's four largest defence companies -- Elbit Systems , Israel Aerospace Industries, Israel Military Industries and Rafael Advanced Defence Systems. Israel's defence exports totalled $5.7 billion in 2015, about 14 pct of all exports and a major driver of the economy. OPTIONS None of the companies asked by Reuters to discuss the aid package were willing to speak on the record, mentioning concerns about future business. But several executives, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that as a result of the deal they were already considering contingency plans. One option would be for larger firms to open subsidiaries in the United States, like Elbit has done, to compensate for the loss of business. They might also acquire smaller U.S. firms. As one executive put it: "This should be translated into an opportunity for the Israeli industry, which should penetrate new markets and improve their competitive ability." "We should face the global trends and the fact that Israel is losing its ability to compete," the official said, adding the company where he works would "accelerate the process" of searching for a U.S. company to buy. Another area of concern is the loss of Israeli know-how, with aerospace engineers and scientists potentially moving abroad if there is a decline in inward spending and investment. The executives said they hoped that when the time comes, the government will find the nearly $1 billion a year extra needed to keep the sector afloat under terms of the agreement, although the sum may be hard to come by given the fractured political environment. According to Israel's Manufacturers' Association, even a 1 billion shekel ($265 million) cut in the defence budget will lead to the layoff of more than 2,000 workers, mostly from small- and medium-sized subcontractors that have a "to be or not to be" dependence on orders from the Israeli defence establishment. A source close to Netanyahu said the prime minister didn't anticipate any closure of small defence companies, and noted the procurement changes would go into effect only in time. On the domestic political front, the right-wing leader has drawn fire over the new pact from critics, including his former defence minister Ehud Barak, who said that Netanyahu's vocal opposition to last year's U.S.-led nuclear deal with Iran had jeopardised a potentially larger package. However, with uncertainties surrounding a tightly contested election for the White House, Netanyahu was keen to wrap up an agreement, replacing the current $30 billion deal that expires at the end of fiscal 2018. Addressing his cabinet on Sunday, Netanyahu called arguments that Israel was short-changed in the negotiations "distortions and fabrications of parties with political interests". Avraham Bar David, a former general who works with some 200 small Israeli defence contractors through the Manufacturers' Association, predicted that "70 to 100 of them" will not survive the local procurement restriction. "These companies are too small to sell abroad," he said.

پارسی العربية اردو کوردی Türkçe English Mehrnews English Fri 18 November 2016 × Economy Home All News Iran World Politics Economy Culture Technology Sports Photo Cartoon Video Opinion Boeing delivers aircraft to Iranian Naft Airlines News ID: 3774733 - Wed 21 September 2016 - 10:09 Economy TEHRAN, Sep. 21 (MNA) – Managing director of Iranian Naft Airlines said the first aircraft has been received from America’s Boeing Company. “One of the four Boeing 737 single-aisle jetliners bought from the US was delivered to Naft Airlines on Sunday to add 20 per cent to the airline’s passenger capacity,” said Nurollah Rezai Niyaraki. The official noted that a deal was inked with the Boeing Aircraft manufacturing company after the JCPOA to purchase four 737 jets one of which was delivered two days ago. Rezai Niyaraki underlined that plans have been made to receive the remaining three Boeing 737 aero planes by the end of the current Iranian calendar year (ends on March 20, 2017). “Given that the new aircraft can carry 150 passengers, the aggregate capacity of Iranian Naft Airlines has reached 900 seats,” he continued. The newly-arrived aircraft performed its first flight from Tehran to Ahvaz on Sunday at 17:00 o’clock local time while it is scheduled to carry out eight legs of flights per day in domestic routes. Iranian Naft Airlines, a homebound charter airline providing passenger and cargo services to Iran’s Ministry of Petroleum, appears to be the first Iranian company to have its deal cleared by the US Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC).

Currently an IT operations manager at Access Unified Networks. Political experience: Currently the elected Secretary for the Libertarian Party of Spokane County since February. Previously served as the chairman of the bylaws committee for the Libertarian Party of Spokane County. Family: Single. No children. For Libertarian Randy McGlenn II, the best way to get something done is to do it yourself. After years of watching voters elect Democratic leaders in the 3rd Legislative District, and after years of hearing stories of residents feeling they weren’t being represented, the longtime IT worker decided to run against incumbent Democrat Marcus Riccelli in 2014. He didn’t make it out of the primary, earning less than 8 percent of the vote. So he ran again. And this year, Riccelli and McGlenn were the only two candidates entering the primary on Aug. 2. McGlenn won less than 30 percent of votes. But that hasn’t slowed his enthusiasm. “I can sit back and grumble all day long about what somebody is doing, but if I want to see that change, I have to be that change,” McGlenn said. Before registering as a Libertarian, McGlenn shared political opinions with both Republican and Democratic parties. He said it wasn’t until Nancy Pelosi’s infamous “We have to pass the bill so that you can find out what is in it” line in 2010 in regard to the Affordable Care Act that he started to distrust established politics completely. And that mindset carried over to state and Spokane politics, specifically to the historically Democratic 3rd Legislative District, where McGlenn says Riccelli has had a one-way voting record: strictly Democratic. “First and foremost, we should represent Spokane,” McGlenn said. “Not the Democrats, not the Republicans: Spokane. That’s something I can do better than either party.” Riccelli, who has held the seat since 2012, doesn’t see things the same way. While he agrees it’s good for voters to have choice in an election, he thinks his track record speaks for itself. Since 2012, he’s won the general election by about 60 percent of the vote or more. And while his voting record in Olympia favors Democratic-sponsored bills, he recently worked with Sen. Mike Baumgartner, R-Spokane, on a bill that allowed Washington State University to open a medical school on its Spokane Campus. “I’m not a Democrat, Republican or a Libertarian – I’m a member of this community,” Riccelli said. “Party doesn’t matter if you’re delivering for your community.” If elected, McGlenn said one of the first points of order would be to crack down on Washington corporations that aren’t paying their fair share of taxes. That means cutting tax breaks to companies such as Microsoft and Boeing, which save millions in incentives each year, and working on getting larger industries to settle in Spokane instead of moving closer to Olympia, where McGlenn says they’re able to successfully lobby the Legislature. “We need to end the ‘sweetheart deals’ with Boeing, Microsoft and other large businesses on the West Coast,” he said. “Because the rest of us are picking up the tab.” But in the meantime, McGlenn plans to continue canvassing and informing voters of other parts of his platform, which includes better funding for mental health services and education. He also wants to simplify tax codes overall, and to find ways to make Washington’s government more efficient. His campaign has raised $1,100, most of which is donated by individual donors. He’s spent $700. Riccelli said he agrees that fixing tax loopholes and keeping jobs in the state is important for him and his constituents. Leading up to the general election, his campaign is focused on engaging voters on the planned upgrades to the North Spokane Corridor, getting healthy foods in school and beefing up health care, specifically mental health services. He also wants to expand Spokane’s film industry by incentivizing it through tax breaks, and increasing the minimum wage statewide. His campaign has raised $100,000 and spent about $80,000. When it comes to the election process, Riccelli looks at it like a job interview. For the past two cycles, he believes he’s been the best fit, and in his opinion, this upcoming general election is no different. “Whether my opponent is from one party or another, or the same party, I look forward to a robust discussion,” he said. “I look forward to making my case to voters on why I should be rehired.” Published: Sept. 20, 2016, 7:56 p.m.  Tags: 2016 Washington election, Marcus Riccelli, Randy McGlenn II Click here to comment on this story » ​ Follow the Spokesman wherever you are: Facebook Twitter Newsletter Subscribe Unlimited Digital Access Print edition home delivery Help Customer Service Sitemap Directory Subscriber Services Classifieds Classifieds Advertising Obituaries More Staff Cowles Jobs Archives/Research Buy photo reprints Jumble Crossword Horoscopes Contact Us Downtown Spokane 999 W Riverside Ave Spokane, Wa 99201 Mailing Address P.O.

Among other inaccuracies and flaws, the report cites Bellingcat’s ignorance of technical details. The Russian report is based on the investigation carried out by a team of bloggers, journalists, aviation experts and volunteers calling themselves ‘Anti-Bellingcat’. It makes use of the technical expertise of the Russian arms producer Almaz-Antey. The leader of the group and author of the report is Yury Kotenok, editor-in-chief of the news website Segodnia.ru. The biggest challenge for them is to help shed light on the absolute truth behind the tragedy. Their primary objective is to cut short the continuous spread of disinformation regarding the MH17 international investigation.  According to the authors of the Russian report, published on Tuesday, Bellingcat is “ready to design any version whatsoever meant to accuse Russia." “That’s an information war,” Mikhail Malyshevsky, an adviser to the chief designer of Almaz-Antey, said in an interview with the Komsomolskaya Pravda daily. “[Bellingcat’s] version [of the tragedy] is evidence-free. They do not build a version based on facts, but trim the facts to fit their version. Just to give an example, the Dutch, at the suggestion of Bellingcat, claim that the missile flew toward the plane. This has been refuted by all our data, both mathematical and experimental,” he noted on Friday. Read more Russian arms producer challenges media criticism of its MH17 crash inquiry – report The first discrepancy, noted by the Russian activists that Bellingcat was trying to prove that the Malaysian Boeing was shot down by a BUK missile system belonging to the Russian army.  As “proof” Bellingcat referred to a Paris Match photo in July 2014 in Ukraine allegedly showing a BUK missile system being transported near Donetsk. The British outlet compared it with a picture of a BUK on the way inside Russia in Belgorod Region, alleging they are one and the same. However, in their report, Russian activists note a key difference between the two. The BUK pictured in Russia contains a "step" on the left side of the system. It has been introduced only after 1984 to ease the crew’s embarking to the vehicle. The picture posted by Paris Match and cited by Bellingcat does not have that feature,the activists note. “This means only one thing – the photographs presented different modifications of the ‘BUK’ systems, so, as sad as it might be for Bellingcat, there is no way it can be one and the same vehicle,” the report states. © segodnia.ru In the report Russian activists have countered Bellingcat’s claims that there have been no Ukrainian BUK missile systems in the conflict-zone in the country’s East. They provided various screen shots of Ukrainian media reports, picturing BUK missile systems of the Ukrainian army in the conflict area. One of the screenshots contains part of the program called “Hour CH” by the Ukrainian First National TV channel. The respective program is dated July 16, just a day before the MH17 crash. “The photo shows a self-propelled fire installation "Buk" [missile system] and radar 19ZH6 (35D6). This radar station in the Ukrainian army is used as an additional means of controlling the air space and targeting systems for air defense fire units, armed with ‘Buk’ [missile system]”, the activists’ investigation finds. Ukraine “does possess BUK missile systems of type BUK M1” and Kiev has in fact confirmed the modernization of some of it, adviser to the head designer of the Russian Almaz Antey arms producer, which also manufactures BUK systems, Mikhail Malyshevsky, told RT. Last Wednesday, Russian media obtained a statement by Almaz-Antey, in which the company accused Western media, including Bellingcat, of trying to manipulate public opinion and confusing facts to discredit its own investigation into the issue. © segodnia.ru Russian activists have also raised questions over Bellingcat’s allegation that the location from where the plane has been shot down by BUK was under rebel control. Bellingcat backs up its claims by showing maps of the conflict region provided by the Ukrainian military as well as services like LiveUAmap и kot-ivanov. But in fact Bellingcat itself admits that the official maps “did not reflect the full picture” of the fighting, according to Russian activists’ report. LiveUAmap has also a problem of being rather not accurate, showing some of the fighting “deep inside Russian territory,” the document adds. Russian bloggers accused Bellingcat of simply “interpreting facts” to suit their theory. “Even an approximate study of the evidences which are imposed by Bellingcat as irrefutable, allow us to make a conclusion about their untenability,” the report says.  Read more MH17 criminal probe at ‘advanced stage’ as relatives press Malaysia Airlines with lawsuit Speaking to RT, the former deputy chief of the Russian Air Defense forces, Aleksandr Tazehulalov, said the Malaysian Boeing might have been shot down unintentionally. “Many are inclined to believe that given the severe condition of the Ukrainian army at that time, the preparation of the crews of anti-missile systems was not enough for their effective use. I cannot confirm this theory … but every crew can make a mistake, there is this notorious human factor. I do not exclude it,” he said. Ukraine has been already involved in a civilian passenger jet being brought down by a missile over its territory. On October 4, 2001 a Russian TU 154 liner was shot down by a Ukrainian S-200 missile during drills in the Black Sea, killing all 78 people onboard. Back then Kiev officially recognized the responsibility and issued an apology. On September 28, the Dutch-led Joint Investigative committee will release its findings on the criminal part of the investigation, which is expected to name the exact responsible side for the crash. Malaysian Boeing MH17 en route from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur crashed over war-ravaged East Ukraine on July 17, killing all 298 people onboard.

Photo By Lanz Mendoza Tension gripped the Ninoy Aquino International Airport (NAIA) on Tuesday when members of the anti-hijacking unit of the Police Aviation Security Group (Avsegroup) surrounded a Saudi Airline plane after the pilot mistakenly pressed the distress call button. The plane, a Boeing B777, landed at 2:39 p.m. but the 400 passengers were only allowed to disembark at 5 p.m. Airport officials said the Manila Control Tower (MCT) received the distress call at 2:15 p.m., prompting authorities to believe that the plane was under threat. Upon receiving the distress signal, airport authorities implemented a standard operating procedure “in accordance with the airport emergency plan.” The plane, which came from Jeddah, was not allowed to dock at Terminal 1 and the pilot was advised to park at the end of the taxiway. A crisis management team was deployed to verify if there was a hijacking incident. Manila International Airport Authority (MIAA) general manager Ed Monreal later told reporters that there was no hijacking and that the pilot in command made a mistake. Monreal said the pilot accidentally pressed the distress button twice. He said the control tower asked the pilot to confirm if the plane was under threat and he again pressed the distress button. “We cannot take chances because we can not determine the real situation inside the aircraft. How can we say if the pilot is telling the truth if it was merely an accident or he may have been ordered to press the button at gun point,” he said. The tension eased when the passengers were finally allowed to disembark. However, they were subjected to rigid security check. Because of the incident, two international flights were diverted to Clark International Airport. Share. Twitter Facebook Google+ Pinterest LinkedIn Tumblr Email loading... Comments are closed.

In this report, Technavio covers the market outlook and growth prospects of the globalmachining centersmarketfor 2016-2020. The market is further categorized into four end-user segments, which are automotive, aerospace, metal fabrication, and others. "Low-cost manufacturing opportunities in APAC have compelled many companies across industries to shift their manufacturing bases to this region. Rising automotive production in Thailand and initiatives like Make in India have made APAC the focal point of global manufacturing. Therefore, Technavio expects this region to dominate the global market in manufacturing, and in turn, the machining centers market," says Gaurav Mohindru, a lead engineering tools research expert from Technavio. Technavio's heavy industry research analysts segment the global machining centers market into the following regions: APAC EMEA Americas In 2015, with a market share of over 40%, APAC dominated the global machining centers market, followed by EMEA with over 32% and the Americas with approximately 28%. APAC: growing market for machining centers APAC is a growing market for machining centers. The increasing investments in the major end-user industries such as automotive are fueling the demand for machining centers. The next major automotive market is India. Automobile sales in the country were 23.9 million units until April 2016 compared with 23.3 million units during the same period in 2014. This includes commercial vehicles, three wheelers, two wheelers, and passenger vehicles. The growing automobile market in India is one of the major reasons for the increasing investment by industry majors. The aviation sector in China is controlled by the Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC) a major supplier of militaryplanes and helicopters to the People's Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF). This organization is posing a tough competition for global giants like Boeing and Airbus. The Chinese aerospace and defense sector is becoming a global military and defense competitor and is expected to be one of the major players in this sector in the next 25 years. Thus, the growth in the major end-user segments in APAC is expected to drive the demand for machining centers in the region during the forecast period.

EMEA: growth in major end-user industries in EMEA to boost growth The machining centers market is expected to grow over the forecast period despite the economic crisis, owing to the economy offered by such equipment. Machining centers provide industries with the opportunity for automation that results in better efficiency and lower power consumption. Automation and its consequences also enable companies to adhere to the strict regulations for energy efficiency and consumption implemented by the governments in European countries, like the 2012 Energy Efficiency Directive for 2020. Countries like UK, Italy, and Germany are major consumers of machining centers in the European market. This is mainly because of the presence of multinational automotive and aerospace companies in this region. The sales of automobiles improved considerably in the European Union since the financial crisis of 2008. Automobile sales showed a 9.3% growth in 2015 compared with that of 2014. In the Middle East and Africa, the automotive market is expected to show remarkable growth during the forecast period. This region is considered as relatively un-motorized by major automakers. The main countries that are expected to contribute to the growth of the automotive sector in this region are Egypt, Iran, South Africa, and Nigeria. During the forecast period, automobile sales in MEA region are expected to reach 3 million units annually, leading to 50% production capacity in the sector. Aerospace is another major sector that uses machining centers in EMEA. Boeing and Airbus are expected to increase their production capacity to meet global demand. The commercial and residential construction sector in Europe is expected to revive in 2016 and is likely to drive the market for the metal fabrication sector where machining centers are also deployed. In the EU, the construction sector in 19 countries is expected to enjoy a positive outlook and show significant growth. Thus, the growth in major end-user industries in EMEA is expected to drive the global market for machining centers during the forecast period. Americas: US holds the largest market for machining centers Being the most industrialized country in North America, the US holds the largest market for machining centers. This is attributed to the growing automobile, aerospace, and metal fabrication industries in the country. Traditionally, the US has always been a leader in the automotive sector in terms of technology and innovations. The country's automobile sector enjoys high demand mainly because of the huge consumer base with high disposable incomes. The high demand for automobiles, in turn, drives the equipment manufacturer market and attracts huge investments in this sector. The top vendors in the global machining centers market highlighted in the report are: Dalian Machine Tool Group (DMTG) DMG Mori Shenyang Machine Tool (SMTCL) Yamazaki Mazak Browse Related Reports: Global Metal Forming Machine Tools Market 2016-2020 Machine Tools Market in US 2015-2019 Global Metal Cutting Machine Tools Market 2016-2020 Do you need a report on a market in a specific geographical cluster or country but can't find what you're looking for?

The A350 XWB is the latest addition to the THAI fleet and will operate on the Bangkok-Melbourne route. Photo/Airbus The cabin of Thai Airway’s A350 stands out for its Thai contemporary design. Photo/Airbus The Royal Silk Class of A350 is equipped with staggered seating, offering a good sense of privacy especially in the window seats. Photo/Airbus The Economy Class has the 3-3-3 seating with the “hot seats” numbered 50A and 50K. Photo/Airbus Along with a good choice of movies, the in-flight entertainment system also features the THAI Sky Connect, Wi-Fi service. Photo/Airbus Stretching its wings September 21, 2016 01:00 By Ariya Chayarit The Nation Toulouse, France Thai Airways International (THAI) sends it first A350 XWB into the sky with the royally bestowed name Wichian Buri The newest member of Airbus’ leading widebody family, the A350 XWB (Extra Wide Body) is a mid-size long-range aircraft featuring the very latest in aerodynamic design, carbon fibre fuselage and wings, and the new, very efficient Rolls-Royce Trent XWB engines. With these technologies improving performance in all aspects of operation, the A350 XWB is a serious competitor to Boeing’s B787 and B777. It also offers a 25-per-cent reduction in fuel burn and emissions and lower maintenance costs. The A350 XWB also claims to be the quietest passenger aircraft, next to the giant A380 superjumbo. It is six decibels quieter than the Boeing 787. Thais boarding the newly christened Wichian Buri, as Thai International Airways’ first A350 XWB is known, can be forgiven for immediately associating the aircraft with the grilled chicken for which its namesake district in Phetchabun province is known. While that probably isn’t on the menu, the plane does seem to have been created especially for Thais with the winglets on the newly designed wings bringing to mind the delicate hands of a Thai classical dancer – sweet but strong. Marginally wider that the Boeing 787, the cabin is done out in THAI’s signature violet and boasts both a contemporary design and mood lighting. It is configured in a premium two-class layout with a total of 321 seats: 32 seats in the Royal Silk business class and 289 seats in the main cabin economy class. Highlights in Royal Silk class include the 1-2-1 staggered seating with direct aisle access for each passenger, a fully lie-flat design seat that allows a six-foot-tall passenger to sleep stretched out and a 16-inch video screen. Economy class meanwhile has 3-3-3 seating with the “hot seats” numbered 50A and 50K. These special seats give passengers extra space to stretch their legs since the seats in row 49 are laid out in 2-3-2 leaving gaps at the left and right. To make the A350 economy class different from others, the most comfortable seat – the B/E aerospace pinnacle seat – is used throughout. It’s 18-inches wide, an inch wider than most economy class seats and equipped with a 11-inch video screen. The plane is equipped with the latest Panasonic eX3, in-flight entertainment system boasting about 100 movies, TV programmes, radio channels, music albums, and games. The flight also provides THAI’s Sky Connect Wi-Fi service.  Another plus is the extra-size overhead bins, with each stowing five standard cabin-compliant cases of maximum dimensions with up to 45 kilogramme weight. Airbus says it has 810 orders of the A350 XWB from 43 customers worldwide, making it one of the most successful widebody aircraft ever.  The Wichian Buri is the first of a dozen aircraft set to join the THAI fleet. Four are purchased directly from Airbus while the other eight are acquired under lease agreements. They will all be in service by 2018. After a short period of regional flights between Bangkok and Chiang Mai, Wichian Buri starts its regular Bangkok-Melbourne route next month.   Tags Thai Airways Airbus A350 Bangkok Air travel Most Viewed TODAY LAST 7 Days LAST 30 Days Blasts from the past...

The worries are that a nine-to-12 month delay in returning to its launch tasks could wipe out the business. September 1st saw a SpaceX rocket suffer an on-ground ‘anomaly’ as it was being tested prior to launching a Spacecom satellite (Amos-6) and explode spectacularly in a blazing fireball. Last week, SpaceX’s president Gwynne Shotwell explain in a very relaxed manner that she was confident that the Elon Musk-owned venture would be returning to normal flight operations during November. Somewhat controversially, the United Launch Alliance’s CEO Tory Bruno, speaking a week ago, talked of SpaceX being grounded for between nine and 12 months. The Alliance is a j-v between Boeing and Lockheed Martin, two giant names in the rocket business and a regular contractor to the US military. Arianespace’s CEO made similar noises at last week’s Euroconsult Space Business Week summit, stressing how its Ariane 5 rockets had enjoyed a winning streak of 73 successful flights, and also saying that the French Guiana-based rocket facility had been inundated with enquiries as to available launch slots over the next two years. The delays to SpaceX – and the consequential further delays to a long list of clients which are booked onto future launches – is already a worry. If SpaceX cannot clearly identify the root cause of the conflagration, then there will be worries over future launches. Indeed, it’s highly unlikely that future launches would get insurance cover if the cause isn’t clearly defined. Then, assuming a fault is identified, it will have to be remedied. There’s also on-going repair work to Launch Complex 40 (and its supporting metal structure), as well as preparation on the adjacent Launch Complex 39A which was always destined to handle Falcon ‘Heavy’ launches, and not those of the Falcon 9 craft.

REUTERS/Edgar Su/File PhotoMore By Steven Scheer JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israel's defence industry faces layoffs, closures and a scramble to set up shop in the United States following the signing of a new U.S. military aid package that phases out Israel's ability to spend a quarter of the funds on its own businesses. The 10-year, $38 billion agreement, signed on Sept. 15 after a year of negotiations, comes into effect in U.S. fiscal year 2019. It constitutes the most military assistance Washington has ever provided to an ally, but was clinched only after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu accepted concessions. Key among those is the gradual phasing out of a clause allowing Israel to spend 26.3 percent of the funds on its own defence sector, which competes actively with U.S. firms such as Boeing, Lockheed Martin, General Dynamics and Raytheon. That means Israeli defence companies will miss out on up to $10 billion that might otherwise have been spent on home-made drones, missiles, tanks and other equipment, depending on the precise terms of the phase-out, which remain unclear. Once that phase-out is completed, all the funds in the agreement will have to be spent in the United States. "It's quite a problem," said one Israeli defence industry official, who asked not to be named because of the sensitivity of the issue. "The bigger companies and most advanced ones with the best technology and capabilities will be able to survive, but the smaller you are, the bigger the problem is." Netanyahu's office declined to comment on the domestic consequences of the aid deal but has said the agreement "will greatly strengthen the security of Israel". Israel has about 700 defence-related firms, most of them with only 50 to 150 employees. They mainly act as subcontractors to Israel's four largest defence companies -- Elbit Systems, Israel Aerospace Industries, Israel Military Industries and Rafael Advanced Defence Systems. Israel's defence exports totalled $5.7 billion in 2015, about 14 pct of all exports and a major driver of the economy. OPTIONS None of the companies asked by Reuters to discuss the aid package were willing to speak on the record, mentioning concerns about future business. But several executives, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that as a result of the deal they were already considering contingency plans. One option would be for larger firms to open subsidiaries in the United States, like Elbit has done, to compensate for the loss of business. They might also acquire smaller U.S. firms. As one executive put it: "This should be translated into an opportunity for the Israeli industry, which should penetrate new markets and improve their competitive ability." "We should face the global trends and the fact that Israel is losing its ability to compete," the official said, adding the company where he works would "accelerate the process" of searching for a U.S. company to buy. Another area of concern is the loss of Israeli know-how, with aerospace engineers and scientists potentially moving abroad if there is a decline in inward spending and investment. The executives said they hoped that when the time comes, the government will find the nearly $1 billion a year extra needed to keep the sector afloat under terms of the agreement, although the sum may be hard to come by given the fractured political environment. According to Israel's Manufacturers' Association, even a 1 billion shekel ($265 million) cut in the defence budget will lead to the layoff of more than 2,000 workers, mostly from small- and medium-sized subcontractors that have a "to be or not to be" dependence on orders from the Israeli defence establishment. A source close to Netanyahu said the prime minister didn't anticipate any closure of small defence companies, and noted the procurement changes would go into effect only in time. On the domestic political front, the right-wing leader has drawn fire over the new pact from critics, including his former defence minister Ehud Barak, who said that Netanyahu's vocal opposition to last year's U.S.-led nuclear deal with Iran had jeopardised a potentially larger package. However, with uncertainties surrounding a tightly contested election for the White House, Netanyahu was keen to wrap up an agreement, replacing the current $30 billion deal that expires at the end of fiscal 2018. Read More Addressing his cabinet on Sunday, Netanyahu called arguments that Israel was short-changed in the negotiations "distortions and fabrications of parties with political interests". Avraham Bar David, a former general who works with some 200 small Israeli defence contractors through the Manufacturers' Association, predicted that "70 to 100 of them" will not survive the local procurement restriction. "These companies are too small to sell abroad," he said.

"The bigger companies and most advanced ones with the best technology and capabilities will be able to survive, but the smaller you are, the bigger the problem is." Netanyahu's office declined to comment on the domestic consequences of the aid deal but has said the agreement "will greatly strengthen the security of Israel". Israel has about 700 defence-related firms, most of them with only 50 to 150 employees. They mainly act as subcontractors to Israel's four largest defence companies -- Elbit Systems, Israel Aerospace Industries, Israel Military Industries and Rafael Advanced Defence Systems. Israel's defence exports totalled $5.7 billion in 2015, about 14 pct of all exports and a major driver of the economy. OPTIONS None of the companies asked by Reuters to discuss the aid package were willing to speak on the record, mentioning concerns about future business. But several executives, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that as a result of the deal they were already considering contingency plans. One option would be for larger firms to open subsidiaries in the United States, like Elbit has done, to compensate for the loss of business. They might also acquire smaller U.S. firms. As one executive put it: "This should be translated into an opportunity for the Israeli industry, which should penetrate new markets and improve their competitive ability." "We should face the global trends and the fact that Israel is losing its ability to compete," the official said, adding the company where he works would "accelerate the process" of searching for a U.S. company to buy. Another area of concern is the loss of Israeli know-how, with aerospace engineers and scientists potentially moving abroad if there is a decline in inward spending and investment. The executives said they hoped that when the time comes, the government will find the nearly $1 billion a year extra needed to keep the sector afloat under terms of the agreement, although the sum may be hard to come by given the fractured political environment. According to Israel's Manufacturers' Association, even a 1 billion shekel ($265 million) cut in the defence budget will lead to the layoff of more than 2,000 workers, mostly from small- and medium-sized subcontractors that have a "to be or not to be" dependence on orders from the Israeli defence establishment. A source close to Netanyahu said the prime minister didn't anticipate any closure of small defence companies, and noted the procurement changes would go into effect only in time. On the domestic political front, the right-wing leader has drawn fire over the new pact from critics, including his former defence minister Ehud Barak, who said that Netanyahu's vocal opposition to last year's U.S.-led nuclear deal with Iran had jeopardised a potentially larger package. However, with uncertainties surrounding a tightly contested election for the White House, Netanyahu was keen to wrap up an agreement, replacing the current $30 billion deal that expires at the end of fiscal 2018. Addressing his cabinet on Sunday, Netanyahu called arguments that Israel was short-changed in the negotiations "distortions and fabrications of parties with political interests". Avraham Bar David, a former general who works with some 200 small Israeli defence contractors through the Manufacturers' Association, predicted that "70 to 100 of them" will not survive the local procurement restriction. "These companies are too small to sell abroad," he said.

The 10-year, $38 billion (£29.3 billion) agreement, signed on Sept. 15 after a year of negotiations, comes into effect in U.S. fiscal year 2019. It constitutes the most military assistance Washington has ever provided to an ally, but was clinched only after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu accepted concessions. Key among those is the gradual phasing out of a clause allowing Israel to spend 26.3 percent of the funds on its own defence sector, which competes actively with U.S. firms such as Boeing, Lockheed Martin, General Dynamics and Raytheon. That means Israeli defence companies will miss out on up to $10 billion that might otherwise have been spent on home-made drones, missiles, tanks and other equipment, depending on the precise terms of the phase-out, which remain unclear. Once that phase-out is completed, all the funds in the agreement will have to be spent in the United States. "It's quite a problem," said one Israeli defence industry official, who asked not to be named because of the sensitivity of the issue. "The bigger companies and most advanced ones with the best technology and capabilities will be able to survive, but the smaller you are, the bigger the problem is."

Most Wall Street strategists agree that the way to play the fourth quarter and next year is with large cap stocks that pay and consistently increase their dividends. We screened the Jefferies Franchise List stocks, which are the ones the firm ranks highest for its institutional and high net worth clients, and found four companies that look like good picks to finish up the year with. All are rated Buy and pay dividends that are at least as high as the 10-year Treasury yield. AbbVie This stock is one of the top global pharmaceutical stocks picks across Wall Street. AbbVie Inc. (NYSE: ABBV) is a global, research-based biopharmaceutical company formed in 2013 following separation from Abbott Laboratories. The company’s mission is to use its expertise, dedicated people and unique approach to innovation to develop and market advanced therapies that address some of the world’s most complex and serious diseases. AbbVie employs more than 26,000 people worldwide and markets medicines in more than 170 countries. One of the biggest concerns with AbbVie is what eventually might happen with anti-inflammatory therapy Humira, which generated $14 billion in sales in fiscal 2015. That was the most any drug has recorded during a single year and represents a gigantic part of the company’s overall earnings. The problem is that biosimilars and generics are itching to enter the market with Amgen leading the charge, and some Wall Street analysts project that AbbVie may have a difficult time stopping that trend. Back in May, the patent board instituted Coherus BioSciences’ Inter Partes Review against the Humira ‘135 patent. The outcome of the review is expected in 12 months. While most analysts remain positive on Humira duration, the expected litigation uncertainty could continue to create an overhang on the stock, which does give investors chances to pick up shares lower. AbbVie investors are paid an outstanding 3.62% dividend. The Jefferies price target for the stock is $90, and the Wall Street consensus target is $71.28. The stock closed most recently at $62.91 a share. Boeing This top aerospace industrial is still down over 10% since the beginning of the year, and we recently noted it has been the worst performing Dow Jones Industrial Average stock this year. Boeing Co. (NYSE: BA), together with its subsidiaries, designs, develops, manufactures, sells, services and supports commercial jetliners, military aircraft, satellites, missile defense, human space flight and launch systems and services worldwide. Top Wall Street analysts have increased confidence in continuing good demand, and they note that the company has made announcements in the past that support the thesis that the productivity and margins will continue to improve. 787 execution is good as the company works through the backlog, and cash flow looks to be strong with 787 deliveries and C-17 orders. Some Wall Street analysts also point to continued lower oil prices as a bullish indicator for the top carriers who are Boeing’s big customers. Boeing investors are paid a very solid 3.44% dividend. The Jefferies price target is set at $165, and the consensus price target for the stock is $149.27. The shares closed trading on Monday at $127.48.

(Photo: Tom Tingle/The Republic) Story Highlights More than 78,000 veterans and spouses are interred at the National Memorial Cemetery of Arizona The U.S. flag is lowered to half-staff each morning to honor the dead and raised each evening Nathan E. Cook, the last survivor of the Spanish-American War, is among those buried there We could almost add another letter to the state's exalted Five Cs. How about a “D” for defense? Almost sounds like the name of a '50s doo-wop band — “D and the Five Cs.” It's true. Installations like Luke Air Force Base in Glendale, Davis-Monthan in Tucson, the Yuma and Gila Bend's facilities and National Guard sites contribute to Arizona's military bloodline, as do defense contractors like Raytheon, Boeing, General Dynamics, among others. But a more somber site pays homage to those who have served and sacrificed, the 225-acre National Memorial Cemetery of Arizona in Phoenix. Think of it as the Arlington of the desert. More than 78,000 veterans and spouses are interred at the site on Cave Creek Road, which was authorized in 1976 by then-governor Raul Castro and dedicated in December 1978. The facility is one of two in the state managed by Veterans Affairs. The other located in Prescott. AZCENTRAL Who's buried in Phoenix-area cemeteries? Cemetery's mission “Our mission is to honor veterans and their families with final resting places in national shrines and with lasting tributes that commemorate their service and sacrifice to our nation,” administrative officer Deborah Ryan says. “It's a peaceful and serene setting with panoramic views of the mountain.” United States, Arizona and Prisoners of War flags proudly fly daily. The U.S. flag is lowered to half-staff each morning to honor the dead and raised each evening, Ryan says. A flagpole from the USS Arizona from Pearl Harbor holds the Arizona flag. The stirring bugle call “Taps” plays several times each day, along with honor guard salutes, for different ceremonies at casket sites, inurnments and columbarium niches. Ground-level plaques spread out in precise military fashion in all directions. Monuments arranged along the Memorial Walkway and Founder's Plaza include the World War II Submarine Torpedo, the Eternal Flame pyramid and Vietnam Veterans memorial. Notables Among the many at rest at the National Memorial Cemetery of Arizona include Nathan E. Cook, the last survivor of the Spanish-American War, who died at age 106 in 1992. Cook also served in the Navy in World War I and early stages of World War II before retiring after 40 years as a lieutenant. Former Arizona governor Evan Mecham and his wife, Florence, also are at the site. The Army pilot was shot down in 1945 during World War II and was held as a prisoner of war for 22 days. Visitors to the site also note U.S. Rep. Jon Kyl's predecessor to Arizona's 4th Congressional District, Eldon Dean Rudd, who grew up in Camp Verde. Leading medical historian and former Army signal intelligence officer Thomas Bonner also is interred at the National Memorial Cemetery of Arizona. Bonner joined the Army after the attack at Pearl Harbor and went on to be the president of Wayne State University in Detroit and Union College in New York. Bonner died in 2003 in Scottsdale. Everyone is special Arizona's National Memorial Cemetery, Ryan says. “They're all notables,” she says. Contact “Only in Arizona” columnist Mark Nothaft at marknothaft.onlyinaz@gmail.com.

UPDATE 2: SLIDESHOW- 6th Annual Duwamish River Festival was celebrated By 08/27/2011 Event website: SLIDESHOW & SECOND UPDATE: 7:30 p.m. Click on photo for SLIDESHOW Our thanks to Kara & Greg Whittaker, owners, Alki Kayak Tours, for their help. The Duwamish Waterway Park was a family affair Saturday afternoon with cultural dance and music featured on two stages, a dunk tank, boat rides, and tacos and hot dogs served. According to event emcee Paulina Lopez, a South Park resident, 600 hot dogs and 500 tamales were eaten. "This is the most awesome fest in the city," said B.J. Cummings, an advisor with the Duwamish River Cleanup Coalition on policy issues, and a fundraiser. "There is no place in the world I'd rather be than on the banks of the Duwamish River. She added with tongue in cheek, "My heart is in the river. Well, my heart is in the river, but kind of in the mud at the bottom. And until that mud is cleaned up my heart is going to be trapped down there." "We will get it cleaner but we have a long road to go to get it clean, unfortunately," Mayor Mike McGinn told the West Seattle Herald. "Even if we clean out what's in the river, the pollution that still comes into the river from surrounding areas as well as from up river means that we'll have to keep working." Referring to the Duwamish River being identified as a Superfund Site, involving four parties most responsible to fund the cleanup, the City, County, Port, and Boeing, he said, "The four parties are working together, and we'll be figuring out who else will have to help with it (...) It's important that we're looking holistically at the river and the system and trying to make sure we're spending our money wisely so that our first investment gives us the biggest impact. But again, I have to emphasize that even if you clean up what's in the river you have to change the practices of all the sources of the river if you really want to keep it clean." ---------------------------------------- This morning at 9:00 a.m. the event activities began at Seacrest Park on Alki with walkers, bikers, and paddlers. Michael Lewis is event coordinator for the Walk, Bike, Paddle Festival Fundraiser, and a graphic designer. His wife, Mandy assisted. The walk was 6 miles, bike route, 10, and they met up with paddlers at the Duwamish Waterway Park." Five members of the First Aid Station Fast Team of the Seattle Chapter of the Red Coast were dispatched to keep the participants safe. Dusty Doty, 17, of Westwood, went on the kayak tour with his mother, Patty, and their friends in from Montrose, Colorado. "I always wanted to paddle the Duwamish and never have," said Patty. "I thought the park where we are going would be fun to explore. I don't know too much about the Duwamish River but you don't want to be dumping your kayak into it." "It's a great sunny day in the City of Seattle," said Alki Kayak owner Greg Whittaker. "Ive got 14 paddlers plus (more) people with their own kayaks." He prepped his group, "The Duwamish River has been cut off through industrial development which was really important to our economy here, but we are trying to reclaim it through new parks like the T-107 park by Kellogg Island which you will be paddling past." Kate Ayers of Highland Park teaches 5th grade at Concord Elementary School in South Park and was kayaking today. "We are teaching the kids about environmental and social justice and taking an active stance on cleaning up the Duwamish," she said. ________________________________________________________ Press release from event organizers: Duwamish River Festival 2011 6th Annual Duwamish River Festival When: Saturday August 27, 2011, 12:00 pm.-6:00 pm.
