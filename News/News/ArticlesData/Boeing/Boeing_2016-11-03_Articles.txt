The incident occurred during a training exercise as the tanker was preparing to refuel F-15s. There were no injuries as a result of the incident. In August the Air Force awarded a $2.8 billion contract to Boeing Co. (NYSE: BA) for production of the first 19 new KC-46A tankers to be delivered by August 2018. The new tankers will be produced in two lots: Lot 1 consists of seven planes and lot 2 will have the remaining 12. The total number of new tankers is set at 179 to replace less than half the exiting fleet of 59 KC-10 and nearly 400 KC-135 tankers. The KC-135s  average 55 years old and the newer KC-10s average 30 years old, according to an article last year in Air Force Times. According to a report in Aviation Week, the boom was found on private property near Hammett, Idaho, and subsequently recovered. The new Boeing tankers were supposed to begin deliveries to the Air Force next year, but a series of problems have pushed the schedule out until 2018. The KC-46A is based on Boeing’s 767 jet. Boeing built two 767-2Cs and two KC-46As as part of its engineering and manufacturing development contract with the Air Force. The fixed price for those planes was $4.9 billion. Boeing has had to swallow about $2 billion in costs above that figure, but it may be worth it. The total value of the contract could exceed $100 billion, including spare parts and other services.

Just in time for the big brewing lame-duck lobbying fight over the law letting 9/11 victims' families sue Saudi Arabia, foreign citizens are making their first attempt to use the law against the U.S. Turkish press reported an Istanbul district sued the U.S. for harboring the leader of the religious sect that President Recep Tayyip Erdogan blames for July's attempted coup. The plaintiffs said they were inspired by the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act and the principle of reciprocity in diplomacy and international law. JASTA's opponents warned this could happened, but until now it was just talk. Other dire predictions about the law's consequences, such as the Saudis' dumping Treasury holdings and withdrawing other assets in the U.S., have not materialized. NEW FRONTIER: Corporate lobbyists are now targeting the state officials who run elections and write ballot measures. Republican secretaries of state from Washington, Ohio, Colorado and Nevada met with tobacco company Reynolds American, the National Restaurant Association, and the National Rifle Association while those states were collecting ballot initiative signatures, according to documents obtained through open records requests show by Eric Lipton of The New York Times and ProPublica's Robert Faturechi. Liberal groups have also tried to support sympathetic candidates. Last month, Republican secretaries of state shot pheasants and clay pigeons on a weekend hunting retreat with donors in Kansas, where Allen Richardson, a Koch lobbyist, joked, “The Koch brothers out with the Republican secretaries of state — that’s a news story I don’t need.” DRUG FIGHT: The drug industry, including Eli Lilly and a front group called Patients Rising, is going on offense against the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review, a think tank that has been critical of rising drug prices, The Wall Street Journal’s Peter Loftus reports. The drug industry is spending $109 million against a California ballot proposal that give state agencies the same discounts as the VA and fighting an Obama administration proposal to reduce Medicare costs by changing doctors' incentives. WISH LIST: Environmentalists including Greenpeace and 350.org sent a wish list to Hillary Clinton for posts at the Energy Department, Interior Department and EPA, POLITICO’s Andrew Restuccia reports. "We want the Cabinet choices to demonstrate that we’re heard, when behind closed doors we’re told to 'get a life,'" said one environmentalist. The lefties favor Stanford University professor Mark Jacobson for energy secretary, President Barack Obama’s green adviser Van Jones for EPA administrator, co-chairman of the Congressional Progressive Caucus Rep. Raul Grijalva for Interior secretary and anti-Keystone XL movement leader Jane Kleeb. They oppose Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper, former Obama White House climate adviser Heather Zichal and any candidate that has financial interests in polluting companies or lobbied for groups that promote fossil fuels. The League of Conservation Voters, the Natural Resources Defense Council and the Sierra Club have kept mum. EYE ON TREASURY: Hillary Clinton’s list for Treasury Secretary may include Facebook’s Sheryl Sandberg; Federal Reserve Gov. Lael Brainard; TIAA-CREF President and CEO Roger Ferguson; Gary Gensler, chief financial officer of the Clinton campaign and former chairman of the CFTC; and Sheila Bair, a former chairman of the FDIC and now president of Washington College, Bloomberg’s Saleha Mohsin, Mike Dorning and Elizabeth Dexheimer report. Donald Trump is considering his campaign's finance chairman, Steven Mnuchin, who worked at Goldman Sachs, One West Bank, and now serves on CIT’s board and is chairman and chief executive of private investment firm Dune Capital Management, Zachary Warmbrodt reports for POLITICO. Trump could also pick investors Carl Icahn and Wilbur Ross Jr., Bloomberg reported.

It has spurred a hunt for microscopic cracks in similar disks, but answers may be elusive. Share story By Dominic Gates Seattle Times aerospace reporter The nearly catastrophic explosion of an engine that caused a fire on an American Airlines Boeing 767 just short of takeoff in Chicago on Oct. 28 occurred when a specific part that had never before failed broke into pieces. The breakup of a heavy metal disk that rotates in the engine core reveals a new risk to airline passengers that, however rare, has already spurred a scramble by engine-maker General Electric and government safety agencies to find and fix the vulnerability. “The risk will be eliminated,” said John Goglia, a former National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) member with more than 40 years’ experience in the aviation-safety industry. “Will it be eliminated before the next one? That’s the real question. Everything relies upon the timeliness of the system to correct itself.” American Airlines Flight 383 to Miami was speeding down the runway at O’Hare International Airport in Chicago when the second-stage disk of the high-pressure turbine broke apart inside the right engine with a loud explosion that blew metal shrapnel out through the engine casing.

Hot metal ripped through the wing. A fire ignited fed by spilling aviation fuel. In an update Friday, the NTSB described how the pilot aborted the takeoff just seconds before reaching a speed at which he would have had to leave the ground. Slamming on the brakes as the jet reached a speed of 154 miles per hour, he brought the plane to a halt within 25 seconds and 900 yards further down the runway. Moving quickly, the cabin staff evacuated all 161 passengers and nine crew using the escape slides on the undamaged left side of the aircraft. Twenty people suffered minor injuries. Behind them on the runway, the black smoke billowing skyward and the blaze melting the right wing into a drooping mess testified to how close the passengers had come to a large-scale tragedy. A flying ax GE spokesman Rick Kennedy stresses the reliability of the CF6 engine involved. The latest models, introduced in the 1980s, currently power about 4,000 widebody jets, including Boeing 767s, 747s and Airbus A330s, and have flown for more than 220 million hours. “The CF6 is the workhorse engine of jumbo jets on a level never experienced before,” Kennedy said. Yet the danger posed by a so-called “uncontained engine failure” cannot be overstated. The disk that broke apart in Chicago — one of two disks in what’s called the high-pressure turbine that drives the engine’s air compressor — is about 2 feet in diameter and weighs more than 100 pounds. At full power for takeoff, the temperature in the high-pressure turbine reaches more than 2,200 degrees. The pod around the engine has Kevlar armor around the big fan at the front, designed to contain any blades that fly off. But the pod cannot possibly contain the enormous energy of flying metal ejected from an engine-core breakup. The NTSB said Friday one piece of the broken disk went through the right wing, then arced high over the airplane and came crashing through the roof of a UPS warehouse almost 1,000 yards away. “Any time a turbine disk fails, it’s a big deal,” said Goglia. In 2006, a CF6-80 engine — the same model as in the Chicago incident — on another American Airlines 767 that was powered up during maintenance, exploded on the ground in Los Angeles, with no passengers aboard. A big piece of the high-pressure turbine disk in the left engine pierced the engine casing, sliced through the airplane’s lower fuselage and embedded itself like an ax-head in the casing of the right engine on the other side of the airplane. That jarring incident came after two other CF6-80 high-pressure turbine-disk breakups. In 2000, as a US Airways 767 was undergoing engine maintenance on the ground in Philadelphia, a disk rupture split the left engine clean in two and ignited a fire under the wing. In 2002, it happened in the air. The left engine of an Air New Zealand 767 blew up six minutes after takeoff from Brisbane, Australia, damaging the wing flaps and forcing an emergency landing. Luckily, there was no fire that time, and all 200 people on board were safe. A new vulnerability In all three of those CF6-80 incidents, the disk that broke up was the first of two inside the turbine. Although the two disks look alike, the first stage is next to the hottest part of the engine core and must withstand the highest temperatures and air pressure. After the 2006 incident, the government safety system kicked into high gear. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued an Airworthiness Directive ordering urgent inspections of these disks inside older CF6-80 engines. Subsequently, GE redesigned the first-stage disk to take more stress, adjusting the shape and the composition of the sophisticated nickel alloy. All planes flying today have been retrofitted with that redesigned disk, said GE’s Kennedy. “That’s behind us,” he said. But the disk that exploded in Chicago was the second-stage disk. This disk is subject to lower temperatures and air flow, so it undergoes relatively less stress than the first. “There has never been an Airworthiness Directive associated with a second-stage disk,” said Kennedy. “This is new.” That’s what’s raised alarm bells at the NTSB and the FAA. The NTSB said that particular disk had been flying for 18 years and completed almost 11,000 flights, short of the limit of 15,000 cycles after which it must be replaced. Goglia and other industry experts said the sudden breakup almost certainly stemmed from a microscopic crack, caused by a flaw in the metal invisible to the eye, that grew over years of service. Using electron microscopes, metallurgists at the NTSB Materials Laboratory in Washington, D.C., are now scanning the pieces of the broken stage-two disk, 95 percent of which was recovered. “They’ll examine the metal down to the tiniest element to determine the cause,” said Goglia. On Friday the NTSB said the metallurgists have already found “features consistent with fatigue cracking” at a point next to the central bore of the disk. This crack was initiated at a point in the metal that differs from the composition of the material around it, referred to as an “inclusion” or flaw in the metal. “Ongoing metallurgical examinations of the disk will focus on detailed characterization of the inclusion and the fracture surfaces,” the NTSB said. Such a flaw could have originated in tiny impurities in the bar of metal from which the parts were made almost two decades ago, or it may have been introduced during the forging or machining processes. Metals supplied for critical aerospace use are typically melted and resolidified twice to get rid of impurities. The process is meticulously recorded so that, for every part in the engine, GE knows exactly where the metal came from and when it was produced. Likewise, every person with the smallest role in the manufacturing of any piece of the engine records and signs off on their work. “The investigators will look at all aspects of making and machining the disks,” said Kennedy. “There’s a whole paper trail.” Kennedy said Friday that the company is “chasing down a very finite number of disks” made from the same billet of metal as the one that failed and has told airlines in a letter that only one such disk remains in an engine currently in operation. Company investigators will inspect the disk in that engine for microscopic cracks and will likely widen their inspections to more engines as the hunt for a cause continues. If any such cracks are found, the FAA will demand replacement of the disks and also review routine engine-maintenance practices to ensure such cracks are detected in future. A frustrating search So how closely scrutinized are these engine blowouts, and how challenging will it be to find and fix the cause? In 2010, GE redesigned and retrofitted a different part inside older CF6-50 series engines, after an NTSB urgent safety recommendation that followed four serious incidents overseas involving failure of that part. For the CF6-80 engine models like the one in the Oct. 28 explosion, the FAA in 2009 ordered additional inspections of all critical rotating parts, including the two high-pressure turbine disks. Until the Chicago incident, there had been no uncontained failures of the CF6-80 for a decade. During that time, the NTSB reports, there were seven other uncontained engine failures in the U.S., mostly less serious ruptures, in a variety of different engines. But one was similar in its outcome to the Chicago incident: The explosion of a GE-90 engine on a British Airways 777 jet taking off in Las Vegas in September 2015 also ignited a fearsome fire after an aborted takeoff. That was the first-ever uncontained failure of a GE-90 engine, and so likewise spurred a deep investigation. Yet GE’s Kennedy said that despite intense scrutiny of a widening circle of similar GE-90 engines, investigators have not been able to find a related issue in any other engine. More than a year later, the root cause of the Las Vegas blowup remains a mystery. Before the NTSB and GE investigators drilling into the Chicago incident can recommend measures to prevent a recurrence, they need to find the origin of the hidden flaw in the metal. The Las Vegas investigation shows that’s not easy. Dominic Gates: 206-464-2963 or dgates@seattletimes.com Email Newsletter Sign-up Custom-curated news highlights, delivered weekday mornings.

The Business Studio: With 18inch touch screen TV with noise-cancelling headsets, the aircraft is nothing short of luxury. November 4 2016 at 12:20pm Kedibone Modise   Johannesburg - Etihad Airways Boeing 787 Dreamliner touched down at OR Tambo International Airport after its inaugural flight from Abu Dhabi November 1. It's not everyday that one is afforded an opportunity to witness such elegance and splendour as the 787 Dreamliner lands for the first time in Johannesburg, South Africa. Operating daily between Johannesburg and Abu Dhabi, the two-class B787-9 Dreamliner features Etihad Airways’ next-generation Business and Economy Class cabins. “The introduction of the Boeing 787 is a welcome development that will further enhance our guests’ experience on this route,” said John Friel, Etihad Airways General Manager, South Africa. “Today’s modern traveller is constantly searching for comfort, innovation and convenience, and we aim to provide the highest standard of hospitality and technological advancements to make any journey a memorable one.” “Our luxurious Dreamliners offer a best-in-class experience, and attention to every last detail.” he added. With the champagne flowing, guests were treated to variety of the wines and meals that are served onboard including starters, mains and dessert. “We have three starters, four mains and three desserts, that's a standard because we're trying to create a fine dining experience, don't do fish or beef,” said Laming. After all the guests had disembarked, the media and business partners joined the crew for a touch and feel. Our first stop was the Economy class experience. Economy Smart Seats provide enhanced comfort with a unique “fixed wing” headrest on each seat with adjustable lumbar support. The airline’s renowned hospitality includes innovative services such as Flying Nannies to look after the kids, comfortable seats with innovative cushions that convert from a standard pillow to a neck pillow. The aircraft offers both WiFi and mobile connectivity and the latest in entertainment innovation including games, movies and music. Guests also receive complimentary amenity kits with socks, earplugs, toothpaste, toothbrush as well as “do not disturb/ wake me up to eat” eye mask. Our next stop was the Business class. The Business studios are simply spacious, comfortable and very stylish. Everyone was encouraged to experience the elegant recliner seats. They convert into fully flat beds, with special systems to adjust the firmness of the seat, massage function and lighting - all at the touch of a button. Guests also receive complimentary loungewear. With 18inch touch screen TV with noise-cancelling headsets, the aircraft is nothing short of luxury. An addition to the Business class experience is the complimentary door to door Etihad Chauffeur services. We also enjoyed the luxurious service as we we're chauffeured to and from the airport. “Together now with our partners we're the seventh largest airline group in the world having 344 destinations and 711 aeroplanes and over hundred eleven million guests that we fly every year. You hear me say guests and not passengers, that's a big difference in the way we think, the way we design, the way we market and deliver our services across the board. “In the true Emirates spirit welcome you into Etihad means welcoming you as a guest not as a passenger, and that's how we do what we do and how we better our service. “And South Africa of all those countries around the world is an incredibly important market to us, it’s a growing market and it's one of the first destinations to receive B787, “ said Laming. Laming said the best compliment they have ever received was when a guest left the aeroplane and he said “I didn't feel like I was in an aeroplane. Then we know we've done our job.” The aircraft is also deployed to Brisbane,Düsseldorf, Perth, Riyadh, Shanghai, Singapore, Washington DC and Zurich.

 SECOND QUARTER RESULTS Consolidated sales reached $91.6 million, compared with $94.5 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2016. This decrease reflects lower sales to both the commercial and defence aerospace markets, as detailed below, while year-over-year fluctuations in the value of the Canadian currency versus foreign currencies had a marginally positive impact of $0.2 million on second-quarter sales. Commercial sales were $48.7 million, versus $50.0 million last year. The decline mainly stems from lower Tier 1 customer requirements for landing gear components on certain business jet and large commercial aircraft programs. This factor was partially offset by higher engineering sales and by the ongoing production ramp-up related to the long-term agreement to supply The Boeing Company ("Boeing") with complete landing gear systems for the Boeing 777 and 777X aircraft. Defence sales decreased from $44.6 million to $42.9 million. This decrease mainly reflects lower spare parts requirements with the U.S. government and lower engineering sales following the completion of certain development phases. These factors were partially offset by greater R&O sales to European customers and the U.S. government as a result of a higher throughput at the Corporation's facilities. Gross profit reached $16.0 million, or 17.5% of sales, compared with $17.5 million, or 18.5% of sales, last year. The decrease is due to a less favourable sales mix and a higher under-absorption of costs, including excess processing and finishing costs related to the Boeing 777 program. These costs are expected to normalize upon completion of the customer qualification and approval of Heroux-Devtek's surface treatment process. These factors were partially offset by favourable year-over-year currency fluctuations equivalent to 1.5% of sales. Adjusted EBITDA was $14.1 million, or 15.4% of sales, compared with $14.6 million, or 15.5% of sales, a year ago as a result of lower gross profit, partially offset by a reduction in selling and administrative expenses related to year-over-year variations in the currency translation of net monetary items. Excluding non-recurring items net of taxes, adjusted net income was $5.7 million, or $0.16 per share, in the second quarter of fiscal 2017, versus $6.0 million, or $0.17 per share, in the second quarter of fiscal 2016. This year's adjusted net income excluded an after-tax amount of $3.8 million related to the favourable settlement of a litigation, net of legal and other professional fees. As a result, net income reached $9.5 million, or $0.26 per diluted share, in the second quarter of fiscal 2017. SIX-MONTH RESULTS For the first six months of fiscal 2017, consolidated sales reached $187.2 million, versus $192.8 million in the first six months of fiscal 2016. Year-over-year fluctuations in the value of the Canadian currency versus foreign currencies increased sales by $5.2 million. Commercial sales reached $99.3 million versus $101.4 million a year ago, while defence sales totalled $87.9 million compared with $91.3 million last year. Gross profit for the first half of fiscal 2017 amounted to $32.1 million, equivalent to 17.2% of sales, compared with $34.1 million, or 17.7% of sales, in the first half of fiscal 2016. Adjusted EBITDA reached $28.4 million, or 15.2% of sales, up from $27.7 million, or 14.4% of sales, a year earlier. Adjusted net income stood at $11.3 million, or $0.31 per share, versus $11.5 million, or $0.32 per share, last year. Net income was $14.7 million, or $0.41 per diluted share, in the first six months of fiscal 2017, compared with $10.5 million, or $0.29 per diluted share, in the first six months of fiscal 2016. FINANCIAL POSITION As at September 30, 2016, Heroux-Devtek's balance sheet remained healthy with cash and cash equivalents of $15.8 million, while total long-term debt was $146.3 million, including the current portion, but excluding net deferred financing costs. Long-term debt includes $71.1 million drawn against the Corporation's authorized Credit Facility of $200.0 million. As a result, the Corporation's net debt position stood at $130.4 million as at September 30, 2016, while the net-debt-to equity ratio was 0.39:1, versus 0.40:1 three months earlier. OUTLOOK Conditions remain mostly favourable in the commercial aerospace market. In the large commercial aircraft sector, Boeing and Airbus are adjusting production rates ahead of introducing certain more fuel efficient aircraft variants on several leading programs through calendar 2019. Despite slightly lower firm order intakes, their backlogs remain strong, representing approximately eight and ten years of production at current rates, respectively. In the business jet market, the current and future production ramp-up of models for which Heroux-Devtek has designed the landing gear should be favourable for the Corporation going forward. In the defence aerospace market, additional funding has been provided through the U.S. government's 2017 fiscal year, but uncertainty remains beyond that period given the need to address the deficit. The Corporation's U.K. operations provide Heroux-Devtek with a more geographically diversified defence portfolio, which reduces its relative exposure to the U.S. market. The balance between new component manufacturing and aftermarket products and services in the Corporation's defence portfolio and its leading program content also promote more stability. As at September 30, 2016, Heroux-Devtek's funded (firm orders) backlog remained relatively stable at $437 million, versus $438 million three months earlier. "The second half of the fiscal year has historically been stronger and this year should be no exception. Given first half results, and considering the effect of local currency depreciation on our UK operations, we expect low single-digit sales growth for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2017, though we no longer anticipate sales to reach $420 million. Still, over the medium term, we remain on pace to achieve annual sales of approximately $500 million in fiscal 2019 based on existing contracts and planned production rates. For the remainder of fiscal 2017, Heroux-Devtek remains focussed on ramping up production and meeting delivery schedules for the Boeing 777 contract. More progress has been made on the customer qualification and approval process of our new surface treatment equipment in Strongsville, Ohio and we expect to complete this important phase during the fiscal year. The rigorous execution of the largest landing gear contract in our history demonstrates our ability to carry out large-scale mandates, which further strengthens our reputation in the global landing gear market and places Heroux-Devtek in an enviable position to capture additional business opportunities to the benefit of shareholders," concluded Mr. Labbe.

Will Super Hornets bridge IAF's 200-aircraft gap? November 04, 2016 15:11 IST Boeing expects the IAF to soon place an inquiry for twin-engine fighter jets to bridge a 200-aircraft gap in its armoury. And the Super Hornet is ready to fly in, reports Ajai Shukla. The Indian Air Force has already approached major global fighter vendors, inviting them to build single-engine, medium fighters in India. Now the spotlight is expanding to encompass heavier, twin-engine fighters as well. On Thursday, November 3, Pratyush Kumar, president, Boeing India revealed that he expected a second inquiry from the IAF, asking international manufactures for interest in building twin-engine fighters in the country. Along with other vendors, Boeing had received the earlier inquiry for single-engine fighters. With nothing to offer in that category, Boeing wants to sell and build the twin-engine F/A-18E/F Super Hornet -- the US Navy's frontline fighter. Boeing had offered the Super Hornet in response to India's 2007 tender for 126 medium multi-role combat aircraft, but lost out to the twin-engine Rafale fighter, fielded by French aerospace vendor, Dassault. Even so, with New Delhi having procured just 36 Rafale fighters, Boeing assesses that, even after buying single-engine fighters, the IAF will face a major shortfall of twin-engine fighters. Kumar told media persons in New Delhi: 'There is a gap of about 200 fighter aircraft that the Super Hornet can fill, including the naval requirement. This is the assessment of Boeing.' Like the Rafale, the Super Hornet can operate from land-based airfields, and also aircraft carriers. The US military only uses it off aircraft carriers, but other air forces, such as the Royal Australian Air Force, operate the Super Hornet off land bases. Boeing has already submitted a plan through the US-India Defence Technology and Trade Initiative, a government-industry coordinating body, to build the Super Hornet in India. Unlike "other companies" that are offering to shift existing lines, says a politely dismissive Kumar, in a thinly-disguised swipe at Lockheed Martin, Boeing would establish "A brand new, state-of-the-art factory of the future." Boeing's global arch-rival, Lockheed Martin, the world's largest defence corporation (Boeing is the second-largest), has offered to shift its older F-16 line from Fort Worth, Texas to build the single-engine fighter in India. The F-16 faces competition in the single-engine category from the Gripen E, which Swedish company Saab has offered to build in India. Saab has sweetened its proposal with an offer to assist the Defence Research and Development Organisation with completing an improved version of the indigenous Tejas light fighter, called the Tejas 1A. Boeing's competition in the twin-engine fighter segment comes from Dassault and Eurofighter. Usually well-informed sources say Dassault, buoyed by its sale of 36 ready-built Rafale fighters to the IAF, is readying a proposal to build a significantly larger number in India. Boeing, unlike other fighter manufacturers, leverages its military business in India with a major non-military presence in the world's fastest-growing market for airliners. Kumar argues that Boeing's dual presence -- in civilian and defence aerospace -- creates a compelling business case for establishing manufacturing facilities in India. "Manufacturing volumes are needed to create a business case for manufacturing in another country. In defence, volumes are initially limited. So it is a great advantage when commercially viable volumes come from defence and civilian business combined," he explains. Boeing is readying to generate those volumes. In June, Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar inaugurated a new manufacturing facility in Hyderabad, where 300 employees will build fuselages for Boeing's Apache AH-64E attack helicopter, which India has contracted to buy. The facility, which will become the world's sole source for Apache fuselages, is owned by a joint venture between Boeing and Tata Advanced Systems Limited, called Tata Boeing Aerospace Limited. Kumar says the facility will commence production in mid-2017 and the first fuselages will roll out in 2018. In similar fashion, the current Super Hornet line in St Louis, Missouri, US would eventually shut down, leaving only the Indian line to fill global orders for new aircraft and spares.

Navigation Menu Film TV Digital Contenders Video Dirt Scene More Biz Music Legit Jobs Conferences Insight Archives Directory Choose Edition: U.S Latino Global Asia Russia | My Account Sign In Subscribe Home Film Spotlight French-Malian Director Daouda Coulibaly on His ‘Scarface’-Like Thriller ‘Wùlu’ Christopher Vourlias 0 Share This Article Email LinkedIn Print Pin It Tumblr Courtesy of TIFF November 4, 2016 | 02:13AM PT JOHANNESBURG — When a Boeing cargo plane crashed in northern Mali in 2009, just minutes after taking off from a remote air strip in the desert, investigators who arrived on the scene soon made a startling announcement: the plane was believed to be carrying up to 10 tons of cocaine from Venezuela, all of which had vanished without a trace after the crash. While that tale of international intrigue wasn’t the direct inspiration for “Wùlu,” French-Malian helmer Daouda Coulibaly’s riveting debut, the director recalls how the mysterious Boeing crash forced many Malians to recognize for the first time the scale of the drug trade using West Africa as a transit point between Latin America and Europe. That trade was the launching pad for his fast-paced, “Scarface”-style portrait of a young Malian hustler seduced by a life of crime. For Coulibaly, who was born to parents of Malian and Guinean descent in Marseilles, the film is as much a tale of one man’s rough underworld education as it is a reflection of the helmer’s cinematic schooling. While the director acknowledges the influence on his work of African auteurs like countryman Souleymane Cissé, the kinetic pacing of “Wùlu” suggests an even greater debt to the likes of Brian De Palma and Martin Scorsese. It also reflects the vision of a younger generation of African filmmakers whose inspiration is increasingly urban and global. “This is a different time,” he says. Coulibaly is a product of Focus Features’ Africa First program, an initiative that for six years offered funding, mentorship, and distribution deals to young African talent, before being shuttered in 2013. The program, which awarded $10,000 toward the production of a short film, helped Coulibaly and more than two dozen emerging filmmakers from across the continent get exposure on the international stage. The first three shorts to come out of the program – “The Tunnel,” by South Africa’s Jenna Bass; “Pumzi,” by Kenya’s Wanuri Kahui; and “Saint Louis Blues,” by Senegal’s Dyana Gaye – world premiered at Sundance. Coulibaly’s “Tinye So” traveled to the New York African Film Festival, the BFI London film fest, Milan, and Dubai. Gaye’s feature debut, “Under the Starry Sky,” bowed in Toronto, while Bass’ “Love the One You Love” won a slew of awards after its world premiere at the Durban film fest, while also earning nominations in Busan and Gothenburg. For “Wùlu,” Coulibaly spent two years scouting locations in Mali. “I knew exactly what I wanted to do,” he says. But just two months before principal photography was about to begin, Islamic militants attacked a restaurant in Bamako, killing five. Coulibaly and his producers suddenly wondered if the risks were too high. While they’d planned to spend six weeks on location in Mali, it was in neighboring Senegal that they decided to lens most of the film. The decision weighed heavily on Coulibaly, who almost abandoned the project. But in the end, he believes he made a stronger movie because of it. “The problems is that when you shoot, you don’t work anymore. You just execute,” he says. “The fact that I changed things, it pushed me to be creative.” Despite lensing mostly in Senegal, “Wùlu,” which takes its title from a rite of passage among the Bambara people of Mali, is still deeply rooted in Malian culture. Coulibaly first visited the country at an early age, but it was as a teenager that his interest began to grow. Fatherhood would later help him to recognize the importance of teaching his two young children about their roots, and he relocated the family to Bamako for four years before returning to France in 2015. While Coulibaly says he’s “very proud…[to be] an African filmmaker,” he doesn’t want that to inform the lens through which audiences watch his movies. “If it’s a thriller, it’s a drama, it’s still seen as an ‘African film,’” he says. “We still have this kind of attitude [where] people keep seeing your stories as ‘African.’ “I’m not an activist,” he says. “I just want to make films.” Filed Under: Daouda Coulibaly Joburg Film Festival Wùlu Want to read more articles like this one?

Aviation Week, who had access to the artwork, referred to it as a "sleek, tail-less design featuring conformal engine inlets and what looks like a manned cockpit." The report stated that the aircraft looked more like a fighter-bomber than a pure fighter. "The tail-less airframe, thin swept wings and conformal shaping suggest a stealthy, penetrating aircraft that may be able to fly supersonic. The silhouette of a pilot inside the cockpit indicates Boeing is banking on the Air Force sticking with at least an optionally manned platform for the future capability," it said.

Related IAF's new titan, the C-17 Globemaster showcases performance in Mechuka landing China's top secret stealth fighter to be unveiled at air show Boeing's new concept will join the fray for the USAF's sixth-generation air superiority fighter. The air force has recently initiated an Air Force Scientific Advisory Board (AFSAB) study that will begin identifying key capabilities needed to fight in the battlefield of 2030. According to Aviation Week, the Air Force's "Air Superiority 2030" initiative identified a hybrid PCA capability as key to ensuring air superiority in future denied battlespaces characterised by sophisticated air defense systems and counterair technologies. But so far, the air force has only described PCA in relatively broad terms. The report added, "We do know that PCA will be a 'family-of-systems', and will likely include some kind of next-generation stealth fighter to operate alongside and eventually replace Lockheed Martin's F-22s and F-35s. It may also incorporate the new arsenal plane concept, where multiple sensor-shooter aircraft direct fire from an aerial bomb truck crammed with munitions." Earlier in the year, Flight Global stated in a report that according to service officials, there's no "silver bullet" or "exquisite" next-generation fighter jet that will single-handedly evade and counter the types of surface-to-air, air-to-air, anti-satellite, electronic attack and cyber threats that are springing up around the world, particularly if going up against a nuclear-armed state like Russia or China. Instead, the air force would proceed with parallel technology development efforts, like new propulsion systems, airframes, directed energy weapons and hypersonic missiles, to develop a "family of systems" – including longer-range, higher-payload platforms to launch volleys of weapons at targets from "standoff" distances and others that will swoop in for direct attacks.

There's a problem with horizons, though: The closer you get, the more they seem to recede. That's certainly the case in the commercial aerospace market, where products can take decades to develop and decades more to sell. The proposed aircraft will carry 280 people for 12,000 kilometers (7,500 miles) and begin deliveries in about 10 years, according to Commercial Aircraft Corp. of China Ltd., or Comac, which plans to develop the planes alongside Russia’s United Aircraft Corp.  Charity Begins at Home China's domestic aviation market is well on the way to being the world's biggest. Longer-haul markets fall well behind. Source: Boeing 2016-2035 Market Outlook Note: RPK = revenue passenger kilometer, a traffic measure equivalent to flying a single paying passenger a single kilometer. Labels indicate starting point and end point of most popular routes. China has two major advantages in developing an indigenous commercial aerospace industry, and two big drawbacks. Its domestic aviation market is growing fast and will be the world's biggest by 2035. In addition, the dominance of airlines owned by the same state agencies that control Comac means a local manufacturer is well placed to twist arms with potential buyers. Years Pratt & Whitney PurePower engines spent in development 25 The problem is technology. Commercial aircraft, and the engines that power them, are some of the most complex objects ever manufactured. Pratt & Whitney's PurePower Turbofan jet engines spent some 25 years in development before entering service in 2013. Airbus and Boeing are already wearing themselves out trying to keep up with each other's advances into new materials technologies. Both the 787 Dreamliner and the A350 XWB are made up of about 50 percent composite materials such as carbon fiber. The C919 will have less than the A320 -- a model range that dates back to the 1980s -- according to a 2014 article posted on Comac's website. Stuck on the Tarmac Bombardier is nowhere near competing yet in the market for narrow-body aircraft. Orders by year Source: Bloomberg Intelligence Life for challengers to the big two is even harder. Canada's Bombardier Inc. planned to demolish the short-haul duopoly of Boeing's 737 and Airbus's A320 when it started developing its C Series jet in 2004. More than a decade on and with only a tiny slice of the market, the program drove Bombardier to seek a $1 billion bailout from Quebec's provincial government this year. While the C919 has been plagued by delays and is already almost three years behind on its first test flight, it's probably not the aircraft to bet against. As long as Comac can make the thing fly, it can hope for an almost guaranteed market within China -- enough on its own to deal a severe blow to Airbus and Boeing. The proposed twin-aisle jet is a trickier proposition. To sell a plane overseas, Comac will have to convince aviation regulators in other countries that its planes are safe to fly over major cities, then persuade foreign airlines to order them. Purchasing a new model of plane isn't as simple as buying a new car: Pilots and engineers must be retrained and maintenance supply chains set up, so airlines will want to see a strong track record before taking the plunge. Airbus was around for 17 years before it won its first order from a major U.S. airline. It didn't win a deal with a major Japanese carrier until as recently as 2013. Profit Engine Five-year average operating margins of major commercial aerospace companies Source: Bloomberg Note: Shows operating margins for commercial aviation divisions of respective companies. Given all that, and the fact that aircraft manufacturers aren't very profitable anyway, you'd be tempted to wonder why Comac would bother if it wasn't being driven by national pride. It took Airbus three decades to become a serious challenger to Boeing. There will probably be a similarly long runway before Comac's ambitions get airborne. This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners. A contract with regional carrier Eastern Airlines had been signed six years earlier, in 1978.

Group Captain Amit Mahajan said it was the first landing of this C-17 Boeing on this advance landing ground bordering China, demonstrating the air force's capability to reach out to this remote ALG after AN-32 and C-130J aircraft. At an elevation of 6,200 feet, the 4,200 ft-long runway is located just 29km from the Sino-Indian border. Conventional military cargo aircraft operate from 9,000 feet runways even at sea level airfields. Mahajan said this is a quantum jump from the existing capability of AN-32 and C-130J aircraft. Such airlift capability facilitates critical requirement of transfer of men and materials on this rugged terrain, interspersed by high mountain ranges that inhibit road connectivity. In the event of a disaster in the region, C-17 operations to the remote ALG can enhance the speed and quantum of national relief effort. On August 19, the upgraded ALG at Pasighat in Arunachal Pradesh's East Siang district was inaugurated by Union minister of state for home affairs Kiren Rijiju. The touchdown by a Su-30MKI, a frontline fighter jet of the air force at the ALG is a "historic first" in the predominantly hilly state of Arunachal Pradesh which has several ALGs at varying altitudes. The air force will continue to validate airlift operations to the remaining ALGs being renovated in Arunachal Pradesh. This will usher in a new dimension in enhanced disaster response, Mahajan added. Following a memorandum of understanding between the government of Arunachal Pradesh and the ministry of defence in June 2009, the air force had embarked on an ambitious reconstruction plan to upgrade eight ALGs, including infrastructure development at an overall outlay of nearly Rs1,000 crore. The ALGs at Walong, Ziro, Along, Mechuka and Pasighat have since been upgraded and are operational now. Two ALGs at Tuting and Tawang are expected to be ready by the year-end, while the ALG at Vijaynagar will undergo reconstruction as soon as the road connectivity between Miao and Vijaynagar is restored, sources said. The a C-17 transport aircraft was received by the detachment commander Flt Lt S. Dixit on its maiden landing in Mechuka. The air crew, who were part of this historic landing were Group Captain T.R. Ravi, Wing Commander P. Sisodia, Wing Commander K. Patnaik, Master Warrant Officer Tripathi and Warrant Officer Nirana Ram. This would also pave the way for operation of civil flights operating to and from these newly upgraded ALGs that would give a huge fillip to tourism as well as improve the connectivity to these remote locations in the Northeast.  More stories in North East Atul pins hope on BJP stance Mora Dipholu loses colour Russian tourist drowns Eviction fear grips settlers Nomination paper binned No-campaign directive at Raas Ibobi in fix over districts Govt help sought as 200 fall ill after feast Cloud over ST status for six groups NSCN-U to push for peace talks Marathon mission for rights Plea to understand NE psyche Meet focuses on tribes Light on Arunachal tour permit goof-up Cry to protect tribal identities GMC steps up fogging drill Cong mulls legal options BJP gears up for Tripura byelections 13 child labourers rescued Prove us wrong, NGO tells firm Plans to improve air travel in region    Copyright © 2016 The Telegraph.

 YOUR E-MAIL VERIFICATION CODE A model of a widebody jet, which is planned to be developed by Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China and Russia's United Aircraft Corporation is presented at an air show, the China International Aviation and Aerospace Exhibition. While Beijing seeks to challenge leading Western manufacturers Boeing and Airbus, the joint venture, to be set up in Shanghai this year, will develop a 280-seat wide-body plane with a range of 12,000 kilometers China and Russia will invest up to $20 billion to develop a long-haul wide-bodied jet, reports Thursday and a company statement said, as Beijing seeks to challenge leading Western manufacturers Boeing and Airbus. The hugely ambitious plan was first agreed between the Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC) and Russia's United Aircraft Corporation (UAC), whose products include the Sukhoi Superjet 100, in June when Russian President Vladimir Putin met his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping in Beijing. COMAC said in a statement that the joint venture, to be set up in Shanghai this year, will develop a 280-seat wide-body plane with a range of 12,000 kilometers. That would put it in direct competition with Boeing's 787 and the Airbus A350. The project is worth between $13 billion and $20 billion, with each side contributing half, China's state-run Global Times newspaper on Thursday quoted UAC president Yury Slyusar as saying. "COMAC has outstanding technology and designs and we will not only cooperate in technology but also in intellectual property," Slyusar told the newspaper at the China Airshow in the southern city of Zhuhai, adding the plane will be 10 percent cheaper than its competitors. According to the companies' websites, the list price of a 280-seat Airbus A350 is $272.4 million, while a 290-seat Boeing 787 costs $264.6 million. Their putative China-Russian rival will make its first flight in seven years' time, COMAC said, with deliveries beginning three years later. But developing commercial aircraft is an advanced technological challenge and previous Chinese aerospace projects have suffered lengthy delays. COMAC said it will keep the project open and select global suppliers that are willing to "jointly shoulder risks." Beijing is looking to build up its domestic aerospace industry, with the sector among those highlighted in its "Made in China 2025" plan. The country is expected to become the world's largest aviation market, with its travellers taking to the skies in ever-growing numbers. Airbus estimates China will need nearly 6,000 new planes worth $945 billion in the next two decades, with Boeing's forecast even more optimistic at more than $1 trillion. COMAC is also developing its own single-aisle jet, the C919. It rolled it out last year and even though it has yet to make its first flight COMAC says it has so far received 570 orders from 23 customers. The firm's regional jet, the 90-seat ARJ21, flew its first commercial flight in June after years of delays.

Branded “Delta Premium,” the new cabin and class of service “will debut on select international flights in late 2017.” It will represent a distinctly separate class of service – a newly designed seat and enhanced service positioned between business and economy class. The Delta Premium cabin will be introduced on Delta’s new Airbus A350s that will begin entering service for the airline next year. Delta’s A350s will seat 306 passengers, including 48 Delta Premium seats and 32 “Delta One” lie-flat business-class seats. BOOKMARK: Bookmark Today in the Sky homepage for your daily fix of aviation news USA TODAY Delta unveils new uniforms for 60,000 frontline workers USA TODAY Coming to Delta business class: Suites with doors This image shows what Delta's new "Delta Premium" premium economy cabin will look like.  (Photo: Delta Air Lines) The carrier says it will begin installing the cabin to its Boeing 777s in 2018. Delta added "additional fleets may be added” to its premium economy lineup, though the carrier did not offer more details. Delta’s current fleet includes other widebody plane types that fly long-haul international routes. They inlude the Boeing 767, Boeing 747 and the Airbus A330. Delta also uses Boeing 757 narrowbody planes to fly some shorter international routes to Europe and South America. Delta’s regular customers will likely keep a watchful eye to see if the company eventually moves to add Delta Premium to any of those aircraft types, too. In a press release on the subject, Delta offered a 360-degree view of a rendering of its Delta Premium cabin. That display showed the Delta Premium seats arranged in a 2-4-2 configuration. Overall, Delta will become the second U.S. carrier to add a true international premium economy cabin. American’s first premium-economy equipped planes began flying this fall, though the airline has not yet begun selling those seats as a distinct class of service. That’s expected to begin in the spring as American reaches a critical mass for the number of planes equipped with the new seats. USA TODAY Now flying on American: Real international-style premium economy seats While American and Delta will be the first U.S. carriers to add seprate premium economy “cabins,” they've long been offered by big international carriers. And their popularity has grown during this decade, with Air France, British Airways, Cathay Pacific, Lufthansa, Qantas, Singapore Airlines and Virgin Atlantic among the numerous airlines now offering them. Spanish carrier Iberia announced its own plans for such a cabin just last month. The updated premium economy seats mark a notable change for travelers on U.S. airlines. Until now, "premium economy"' has meant little more than the same old economy seat with a bit of extra legroom. There have been moderate other perks, such as enhanced snack options or priority boarding. But the experience has so-far been more "economy with a snack" than anything approaching an actual premium cabin. In rolling out its Delta Premium service, Delta is touting high-end touches that it believes will set its offering apart from its rivals – such as premium trim and finishes and generous storage space. USA TODAY Premium economy: Is it worth the upgrade? The seats themselves will be recliner-type seats similar to the domestic first-class seats offered on big U.S. airlines. Delta says its Delta Premium seats will offer up to 38 inches of “seat pitch,” a measure of the distance from a point on a seat to the same point on the seat in front of it. The seats will be “up to” 19 inches wide and will feature seven inches of recline along with adjustable leg rests and head rests. Prior to borading, Delta Premium customers will get priority check-in, priotity security and early-boarding privileges. Once on the aircraft, they’ll be offered pre-departure beverage service. During the flight, they'll get enhanced meal service during the flight and will be offered a TUMI amenity kit. Additionally, Delta will provide a "Westin Heavenly In-Flight Blanket" with pillow to use during the flight. Seats include a 13.3-inch, high resolution in-flight entertainment screen that Delta claims is “among the largest in its class.” “Delta Premium is Delta's latest example of paying careful attention to what customers tell us they want and responding with unique products designed to meet their individual needs,” Tim Mapes, Delta’s chief marketing officer, says in a statement.

Scroll down for video  A mock-up model of the COMAC was put on display at the Zhuhai Airshow It's said that the joint venture will rival Boeing and Airbus aircrafts RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Millionaire New York property tycoon is jailed for at least...

Share this article Share 27 shares Both COMAC and UAC will invest up to $20 billion (£16 billion) to develop the long-haul wide-bodied jet.  The agreement was reached in 2014 when Russian President Vladimir Putin met with President Xi Jinping in Beijing. The two groups will develop a 280 seat aircraft which will rival Airbus and Boeing.  According to Chinese media, the project is worth between $13 billion (£10 billion) and $20 billion (£16 billion) with each side contributing half.  UAC president Yury Slyusar told the Global Times at the Zhuhai Airshow: 'COMAC has outstanding technology and designs and we will not only cooperate in technology but also in intellectual property.'  China is in great need of extra aircraft as passenger numbers increase (File photo)  COMAC said that the plane will make its first flight in around seven years time.  Deliveries of the craft will come some three years later.  According to COMAC when it comes to suppliers, they will be looking for experience more than anything.  Guo Bozhi, general manager of COMAC's widebody department said: 'We will choose suppliers who have rich experience in development, whose products are competitive globally, and who can continue to guarantee quality from the development stage until the planes go into operation. In the future, China is expected to become the world's largest aviation market with an increasing number of Chinese people travelling by plane.  Airbus estimates that China will need 6,000 new planes in the next two decades to cope with demand.   The Zhuhai Airshow opened on November 1 and is one of the biggest events of its kind.

Russia's UAC and China's Comac hope to give global commercial aviation leaders Boeing and Airbus a run for their money with their new design. United Aircraft Corporation (UAC) and Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (Comac) provided aircraft enthusiasts a glimpse of the new aircraft in mock-up form at Airshow China-2016, taking place in Zhuhai, China this week. Company representatives complemented the unveiling of the mockup by announcing that they have begun a search for suppliers. Officials did not specify funding details or technical characteristics of the joint project, but were able to confirm that the assembly of the new plane will take place in Shanghai. The unveiling was attended by Comac chairman Jin Zhuanglong, OAK director Yuri Slyusar and Russian Trade and Industry Minister Denis Manturov. #Comac unveils the model of #C929 wide-body, co-production with Russia’s @UAC_Russia, at #zhuhaiairshow pic.twitter.com/ewHRhFOa2X — ChinaAviationDaily (@CNAviationDaily) 2 ноября 2016 г. ​The new, as yet unnamed jetliner is expected to start flight testing in 2021, and to enter commercial production by 2025. The project was announced in 2014 during President Vladimir Putin's visit to China as part of a $13 billion deal on aviation cooperation, but few new details have been made available about its development since.  The wide-body aircraft is certainly an ambitious project, given that it hopes to compete with Airbus and Boeing's commercial sales leaders, the A330, the A350, the Boeing 777, and the Boeing 787. According to Comac wide-body department manager Guo Bohzi, the joint venture in Shanghai, whose shares are divided equally between the two parties, will start its work this year. "A wide-body jet is an extremely complicated product, which will require a lot of modern technology, experience and skills," Guo said, speaking to reporters at the airshow. "China and Russia each have their own advantages," he added. © REUTERS/ China Daily A model of a widebody jet, which is planned to be developed by Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC) and Russia's United Aircraft Corporation (UAC) is presented at an air show, the China International Aviation and Aerospace Exhibition, in Zhuhai, Guangdong Province, China, November 2, 2016 Up to three variants of the plane may be built. The aircraft will have two aisles, space for between 250-280 passengers, and a range of up to 12,000 km, making it perfect for long-haul flights. © Sputnik/ Ilya Bogachev Russia's UEC, China's SBW Discuss Joint Gas Turbine Engine ProjectRussia has been making a big impression at Airshow China-2016, with displays from OAK, Rosoboronexport, Almaz Antei, and Roscosmos, among other major companies.

A broad array of military and civilian equipment is being displayed.

The Commercial Aircraft Corp of China, also called Comac, is in talks with Russia’s United Aircraft Corp to produce a twin-aisle, long-haul commercial aircraft, said the Chinese company’s assistant president Guo Bozhi, during the Zhuhai Air Show this week. The new aircraft, which does not have a name, will be designed to compete in the same category as Airbus’ A330 and A350 models, as well as Boeing’s 777 and 787 models. The Chinese aircraft will adopt advanced aerodynamic design and engines with low fuel burn to make them more efficient and more economical for airlines to operate, he said. “We aim to make the direct operating cost of our new widebody jet 10 per cent lower than our competitors,” Guo said. A model of the proposed aircraft was unveiled in Zhuhai, displaying its logo with United’s name. The aircraft will come in three variants, with up to 280 seats in standard configuration, and a maximum range of 6,480 nautical miles (12,000km). The model may be named the C929 if Comac follows the 9X9 mnemonic tradition of its aircraft series. China is one of the latest entrants in the competition to develop home-made aircraft, eyeing the technological prestige and job creation associated with making planes. China, the world’s most populous nation, is projected to require 6,865 new aircraft over the next 20 years valued at six trillion yuan over the next two decades, as airlines replenish their retiring fleets or expand, according to Comac’s projection. About 21 per cent of these will be twin-aisle planes, while single-aisle aircraft make up 65 per cent of the demand, Comac said. Shanghai-based Comac was established in 2008 with the mission to spearhead China’s development of a home-grown aircraft that can help reduce the country’s dependence on Airbus and Boeing. It launched a twin engine jet called the ARJ21, which can carry between 70 and up to 105 passengers to compete with Brazil’s Embraer and Canada’s Bombardier for short-distance flights. Chengdu Airlines became the first customer to take delivery of this aircraft, flying three times a week between Shanghai and the Sichuan provincial capital. Comac also has a single-aisle, narrow body plane called the C919 in development. The aircraft, which can carry between 150 and 190 passengers, is scheduled for its maiden test flight later this year, Guo said. China Eastern Airlines this week said it was in talks to buy up to five C919 models. The C929, when it gets off the drawing board, will be a substantial leap in technology and manufacturing capability for China, said Chen Yong, chief designer of the ARJ21, during a September 29 interview at the InnoTech Expo in Hong Kong. “We are in the final stages of creating a proof of concept” for the widebody aircraft, Chen said. “The biggest challenge we face is our lack of experience in mastering the complexities in assembling a large aircraft.” United, established in 2005, is a consolidation of Russia’s aircraft manufacturing industry, combining the technology and brands of 18 companies including Ilyushin, Sukhoi and Tupolev. It usually takes seven years for a new aircraft to take its first flight after the announcement, but takes 10 years for delivery, Guo said. That means the first C929 delivery is likely to be in 2025. “There will be new technologies involved in the initial stage of developing the new craft and the new technology will be a challenge to us,” he said. “China and Russia each have their own advantages.” “We will prefer to choose suppliers who have rich experience and whose products are competitive , and who can keep the quality from the initial stage until the aircraft goes into operation,” Guo said. Airbus, which currently assembles the A320 family of narrowbody aircraft in Tianjin, is confident about China’s demand for larger, long-haul aircraft. “Over 170 A330s are in service in China now, and it is one of the most favourite aircraft in the country,” said Chen Juming, Airbus China president. Boeing is also getting in on the act. The US planemaker is finalising plans for a facility in Zhoushan, near Shanghai, for finishing work and delivery of its best-selling B-737 narrowbody jets to Chinese airlines.

Reuters SHANGHAI - China and Russia will invest up to $20 billion to develop a long-haul wide-bodied jet, reports Thursday and a company statement said, as Beijing seeks to challenge leading Western manufacturers Boeing and Airbus. The hugely ambitious plan was first agreed between the Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC) and Russia’s United Aircraft Corporation (UAC), whose products include the Sukhoi Superjet 100, in June when Russian President Vladimir Putin met his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping in Beijing. COMAC said in a statement that the joint venture, to be set up in Shanghai this year, will develop a 280-seat wide-body plane with a range of 12,000 kilometres. That would put it in direct competition with Boeing’s 787 and the Airbus A350. The project is worth between $13 billion and $20 billion, with each side contributing half, China's state-run Global Times newspaper on Thursday quoted UAC president Yury Slyusar as saying. “COMAC has outstanding technology and designs and we will not only cooperate in technology but also in intellectual property,” Slyusar told the newspaper at the China Airshow in the southern city of Zhuhai, adding the plane will be 10 percent cheaper than its competitors. According to the companies' websites, the list price of a 280-seat Airbus A350 is $272.4 million, while a 290-seat Boeing 787 costs $264.6 million. Their putative China-Russian rival will make its first flight in seven years' time, COMAC said, with deliveries beginning three years later. But developing commercial aircraft is an advanced technological challenge and previous Chinese aerospace projects have suffered lengthy delays. COMAC said it will keep the project open and select global suppliers that are willing to “jointly shoulder risks”. Beijing is looking to build up its domestic aerospace industry, with the sector among those highlighted in its “Made in China 2025” plan. The country is expected to become the world's largest aviation market, with its travellers taking to the skies in ever-growing numbers. Airbus estimates China will need nearly 6,000 new planes worth $945 billion in the next two decades, with Boeing's forecast even more optimistic at more than $1 trillion. COMAC is also developing its own single-aisle jet, the C919. It rolled it out last year and even though it has yet to make its first flight COMAC says it has so far received 570 orders from 23 customers. The firm's regional jet, the 90-seat ARJ21, flew its first commercial flight in June after years of delays. azk/slb/fa  © 1994-2016 Agence France-Presse Share Facebook Share on Twitter GPlus LinkedIn Pinterest Read More:  china   russia   Boeing   Airbus   jet   aircraft   airplane   comac   /business/11/02/16/more-chinese-tourists-expected-as-china-flights-resume-in-laoag-airport /overseas/11/03/16/china-president-slams-conspiracies-in-communist-party /overseas/11/03/16/china-president-slams-conspiracies-in-communist-party /business/11/03/16/pilots-warned-over-china-rocket-launch /business/11/03/16/china-bank-says-9-month-net-income-surges-31-pct LATEST NEWS MOST READ Perpetual launches men's volleyball title defense vs. CSB November 16, 2016 Adamson's Pumaren wary of streaking Ateneo November 16, 2016 FEU looks to end skid, regain momentum vs. UE November 16, 2016 US-Philippines military cooperation intact: official November 16, 2016 Hollande proposes to extend French state of emergency until May November 16, 2016 US: Renewed Russian strikes in Syria break international law November 16, 2016 New Yorkers build walls of sticky notes in defiance of Trump November 16, 2016 Snapchat has filed confidentially for its IPO: sources November 16, 2016 Ford going ahead with moving small car production to Mexico: CEO November 16, 2016 US to maintain commitment to allies in Asia, admiral says November 16, 2016 Sanhi ng pagbagsak ng power plants, iniimbestigahan November 16, 2016 De Lima, kinuwestyon ang intel funds para sa Pangulo November 16, 2016 Lider ng mga naaresto sa drug raid sa Quezon City, pinaghahanap November 16, 2016 School principal, arestado dahil sa droga sa La Union November 16, 2016 Firing squad, isinusulong ng VACC November 16, 2016 Was Billy Crawford arrested in Hong Kong?

QR 930 was greeted with a traditional water salute upon arrival at Clark International Airport and passengers on-board the inaugural flight were warmly welcomed by Qatar Airways Philippines country manager Paolo Pausini and Clark International Airport Corporation (CIAC) president Alexander Cauguiran. Qatar Airways group chief executive Akbar Al Baker said: “We are delighted to be the first carrier to fly the state-of-the-art Boeing 787 Dreamliner to Clark International Airport. The Boeing Dreamliner aircraft is one of the flagship aeroplanes in our fleet today and its introduction to Clark International Airport reaffirms our commitment to the Philippines market. The Dreamliner has received very positive feedback in the cities we fly the aircraft to, and we hope our Philippines passengers will enjoy this technologically advanced aircraft that will offer them unparalleled in-flight comfort.” Cauguiran added: "The arrival of Qatar Airways award-winning Dreamliner aircraft is a welcome development for Clark International Airport as we strive to develop ourselves into the next premier international gateway of the Philippines. We look forward to forging a stronger partnership with Qatar Airways who has been a strong supporter of CIAC for the past few years.” Qatar Airways Dreamliner has 254 custom-made seats across its Business and Economy Class cabins with specially designed interiors. In Qatar Airways' award-winning Business Class cabin, each of the 22 seats offers the passenger direct aisle access with its 1-2-1 configuration. Passengers can rest in comfort on the fully reclinable seats or use their flying time productively thanks to onboard connectivity service available on-board. The innovative Oryx One in-flight entertainment and communication system that features an intuitive touch screen control unit, giving passengers convenient access to up to 3,000 entertainment options is also available in both Business and Economy Class cabins.

By DC Velocity Staff Comment Joe Sutter, who is known at the "Father of the 747" When shippers need to move valuable cargo long distances in a hurry, they often turn to air cargo. More expensive than options like sea, rail, or truck, air freight has one great advantage—speed. Today, most people take for granted the ability to whisk inventory from coast to coast in a few hours, but few outside the aviation industry remember the name of Joe Sutter. Sutter, who passed away Aug. 30 at the age of 95, is known in the aviation trade as the "Father of the 747." Although he had a hand in many iconic commercial airplane projects, he secured his place in history by leading the team of Boeing engineers that designed the 747 jumbo jet—a team that became known as the "Incredibles" for their feat of producing what was then the world's largest airplane in a 29-month period in the mid-1960s. Boeing went on to sell more than 1,500 747s after completing the original version in 1968, according to the New York Times. The plane was a smash hit because it could haul more passengers and cargo than other aircraft, while flying faster and farther than its competitors could without stopping to refuel. The 747 also boasted a 20-foot-wide twin-aisle passenger cabin, fully seven feet wider than the cabin of its predecessor, the 707. And Sutter made one more design decision that would influence the airfreight industry for decades—he left space for the eight-foot-square cargo containers that would eventually become the global standard for air freight. #Logistics #Transportation #Air Resources Mentioned In This Article Boeing Inc.

Travel News & Advice British Airways to shrink seat space to squeeze more passengers on to flights Exclusive: Airline's 777 jets will have one extra seat per economy row from 2018 Simon Calder @SimonCalder Friday 4 November 2016 16:45 BST BA is adding 52 extra seats to its Boeing 777s The squeeze is on for British Airways economy passengers on the aircraft type that is airline’s long-haul backbone. BA is to add an extra 52 seats to its Boeing 777s at Gatwick from 2018, and plans to “densify” aircraft at Heathrow after that.  Travellers who are accustomed to reasonable elbow room in the cheap seats will find they have less space. While British Airways has nine economy seats abreast in its 777 fleet at present, from 2018 each row will have 10 seats – even though the average girth of passengers is increasing. If the number of toilets stays the same at 11, accommodating almost a fifth more people means that there will be one for every 30 passengers, compared with 25 passengers now. Read more Fury as BA launches seven holiday routes from Heathrow BA increases minimum check-in time Father banned from BA flight despite having a valid passport 25 taken to hospital after emergency on British Airways plane Willie Walsh, chief executive of BA’s parent company IAG, told investors at a Capital Markets Day: “We’re responding to a market opportunity.” He said the move would allow BA to “lower the average cost per seat, charge a lower price and stimulate demand”. In the late 1990s, British Airways had a small fleet of Boeing 777 aircraft at Gatwick that were fitted with 10 seats in each economy row for routes to Florida and the Caribbean. In 2002 they were converted to the nine-abreast configuration to match the rest of the fleet. The slide shown to investors at the Capital Markets Day A spokesperson for BA said: “We are updating our 777 cabins to bring us into line with many of our competitors.” Other airlines with a 10-abreast configuration on the jet include Air New Zealand and Emirates. Air France has a special fleet devoted to Caribbean and Indian Ocean services with 10 seats in each row. Read more These are the world's longest flights BA says that the economy cabin will be fitted with new entertainment systems with bigger screens. British Airways and its main European rivals, Lufthansa and Air France-KLM, face intense competition from Gulf-based carriers, with low-cost, long-haul airlines such as Norwegian also poaching passengers. Lufthansa is rapidly expanding its Eurowings subsidiary to operate a range of long-haul routes, while Air France says it plans to start an entirely new airline “adapted to ultra-competitive markets”. The subsidiary is intended to “enable the Group to go on the offensive by opening new routes, reopening routes closed due to their lack of profitability and maintaining routes under threat”. British Airways will also add 12 extra seats on its short-haul Airbus A320 fleet operating from Heathrow, giving the planes the same seating density as easyJet.  Willie Walsh was previously chief executive of both BA and Aer Lingus, which is also part of IAG. He told investors that passengers connecting to the Irish airline’s transatlantic services in Dublin could soon be flying on Ryanair. Mr Walsh confirmed that Aer Lingus is in talks with Europe’s biggest low-cost airline about feeding traffic to long-haul routes.

By Geoff Ziezulewicz   |   Nov. 4, 2016 at 11:11 AM Follow @upi Comments Sign up for our Security newsletter WASHINGTON, Nov. 4 (UPI) -- Boeing has been awarded a $478 million U.S. Air Force contract for work on the F-15 Eagle Passive/Active Warning and Survivability System. The cost-plus-incentive-fee deal will cover engineering manufacturing and development of the system. Under the deal, the contractor will provide planning, design development, integration, testing and risk reduction activities for the system. Work will be performed in Missouri and has an estimated completion date of August 2020. The Air Force Life Cycle Management Center is the contracting entity. Boeing chose BAE Systems in October 2015 to help develop the electronic warfare system that provides advanced aircraft protection, significantly improved situational awareness and support for future F-15 mission requirements. The system will replace the F-15's Tactical Electronic Warfare Suite, which has been in use since the 1980s. The new system will help ensure the aircraft remains in its scheduled service through 2040. The new system requires a smaller footprint than the past system while providing advanced capabilities that include advanced electronic countermeasures, radar warning and increase chaff and flare capability.

Plans to take 38 Airbus A350s and Boeing 787s are “under review” for deferral, IAG told investors Friday. It will retain four more aging 747 jumbos than planned and an extra seat will be added to each economy-class row on 25 777s based at London Gatwick, creating 52 new berths per plane from 2018. The changes, which also envisage a fleet of 362 Airbus A320-series short-haul jets, 34 fewer than previously planned, will cut capital spending by 1.4 billion euros ($1.6 billion) through 2020. Chief Financial Officer Enrique Dupuy said the rethink is “about delays, not about cancellations,” and that IAG, which also owns Ireland’s Aer Lingus and Iberia and Vueling of Spain, is confident of renegotiating delivery schedules with Airbus and Boeing. IAG’s capacity growth will now be limited to 3 percent through 2020 as a seating glut weighs on fares and the U.K. vote to exit the European Union creates uncertainty and threatens to crimp spending among Britons. Alex Cruz, who runs the BA unit, said voluntary departures are being sought among back-office staff and cabin crew that more IT work will be outsourced. While London-based IAG will retain more 747s -- for a total of 23 by 2020 -- it will get rid of four smaller A340s, which like the jumbo is a venerable four-engine jet that’s less efficient than current models, paring the fleet to seven. The delivery of a sole A330 wide-body has also been deferred. Earnings Downgrade At the same time IAG will devote 400 million euros more to Aer Lingus as it seeks to switch to longer-range variants of the single-aisle A321, reducing the net capital saving to 1 billion euros. A320s operating for Iberia and at the London Heathrow hub of BA will get 12 more seats, while Heathrow’s A321s will get 13 more. The number of smaller A319s at BA will drop to 26 from 44. IAG also cut its long-term profit target as sterling’s decline hurts revenue when translated into euros, in which it reports. Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortization and aircraft rental will now average 5.3 billion euros in the 2016 to 2020 period, down from a previously estimated 5.6 billion euros. Charges this quarter against the British Airways redundancies could match the third-quarter’s 62 million pounds ($78 million), though the bulk will come next year, IAG said, adding that benefits of as much as 400 million euros will take about 18 months to accrue. The plans require consultation with unions. Cruz said BA also aims to reduce maintenance fees and handling costs as it works to slim expenses while pressing home a margin advantage over U.S. rivals from sterling’s devaluation versus against the dollar. The higher-density 777s will provide a cost advantage over Norwegian Air Shuttle ASA, which has begun trans-Atlantic flights from Gatwick. BA has announced plans for new routes including Gatwick-Fort Lauderdale, where it will go to toe-to-toe with the Scandinavian carrier. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

The Global Services &amp; Support (GS&amp;S) unit’s revenue surged 17% to $2.5 billion in Q3 2016, reflecting higher volume in Aircraft Modernization &amp; Sustainment and Training Systems &amp; Government Services.

The Boeing 787-9 is an extended version of the company’s 787-8 Dreamliner that debuted in American’s fleet last year. The new plane is 20 feet longer and seats 285 people, compared to the 226 seats on American’s 787-8. The plane on display at American’s maintenance hangar Thursday hasn’t entered service yet, but a different 787-9 has been ferrying passengers between DFW Airport and Los Angeles International Airport for the last month.

(Nathan Hunsinger/The Dallas Morning News) Staff Photographer Thursday night, American will dispatch the 787-9 on its first international route from DFW to Sao Paulo, Brazil. On Friday, a 787-9 will fly from DFW to Madrid, with plans to add it to routes to Paris and Seoul early next year.  American will have four 787-9 in its fleet by the end of this year, with 18 more still on order. The plane features 30 lie-flat business class seats, 21 premium economy seats, 27 main cabin extra seats-- a coach seat with added legroom -- and 207 economy seats. Pass the popcorn: American Airlines makes in-flight movies and TV free for all While the 787-9 has all the modern touches as the 787-8s currently in service -- including in-flight entertainment screens at all seats and in-flight WiFi -- it’s the first plane in American’s fleet to feature the new premium economy seating section. The premium economy seats, laid out in a 2-3-2 configuration, are wider and feature more-legroom -- about seven extra inches compared to a regular economy seat. The premium economy service also comes with noise reducing headphones, an amenity kit, nicer blankets and pillows, meal service and free alcoholic beverages. It’s roll out is part of a broader airline strategy to introduce more seating options for customers. For instance, while some passengers might not want to pay for business class seats, they could opt to upgrade to the more affordable premium economy class. That’s key for airlines as they work to attract passengers and wring every dollar possible out of a flight at a time when fares have been lower due to increased airline competition. While this type of premium economy seating has been seen on foreign carriers for several years, American will be the first U.S. airline to debut it, although Delta announced Thursday its version of the offering will be available next year. The airline buzzword passengers should know before buying a ticket Premium economy will come pre-installed on all of American’s new 787-9 and its Airbus A350s set to start arriving in 2018. The carrier also plans to retrofit most if its widebody fleet over the next several years to feature the new seats. For now, passengers who want to sit in the premium economy seats will have to purchase a Main Cabin Extra fare and make sure their seat is in rows nine through 11. The seats will be sold under the premium economy banner at a higher price starting in January for flights in April and beyond.

Boeing, Airbus trade barbs as China competition heats up By Benjamin CARLSON Zhuhai, China (AFP) Nov 2, 2016 China, Russia to invest 'up to $20 bn' in long-haul jet: report Shanghai (AFP) Nov 3, 2016 - China and Russia will invest up to $20 billion to develop a long-haul wide-bodied jet, reports Thursday and a company statement said, as Beijing seeks to challenge leading Western manufacturers Boeing and Airbus. The hugely ambitious plan was first agreed between the Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC) and Russia's United Aircraft Corporation (UAC), whose products include the Sukhoi Superjet 100, in June when Russian President Vladimir Putin met his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping in Beijing. COMAC said in a statement that the joint venture, to be set up in Shanghai this year, will develop a 280-seat wide-body plane with a range of 12,000 kilometres. That would put it in direct competition with Boeing's 787 and the Airbus A350. The project is worth between $13 billion and $20 billion, with each side contributing half, China's state-run Global Times newspaper on Thursday quoted UAC president Yury Slyusar as saying. "COMAC has outstanding technology and designs and we will not only cooperate in technology but also in intellectual property," Slyusar told the newspaper at the China Airshow in the southern city of Zhuhai, adding the plane will be 10 percent cheaper than its competitors. According to the companies' websites, the list price of a 280-seat Airbus A350 is $272.4 million, while a 290-seat Boeing 787 costs $264.6 million. Their putative China-Russian rival will make its first flight in seven years' time, COMAC said, with deliveries beginning three years later. But developing commercial aircraft is an advanced technological challenge and previous Chinese aerospace projects have suffered lengthy delays. COMAC said it will keep the project open and select global suppliers that are willing to "jointly shoulder risks". Beijing is looking to build up its domestic aerospace industry, with the sector among those highlighted in its "Made in China 2025" plan. The country is expected to become the world's largest aviation market, with its travellers taking to the skies in ever-growing numbers. Airbus estimates China will need nearly 6,000 new planes worth $945 billion in the next two decades, with Boeing's forecast even more optimistic at more than $1 trillion. COMAC is also developing its own single-aisle jet, the C919. It rolled it out last year and even though it has yet to make its first flight COMAC says it has so far received 570 orders from 23 customers. The firm's regional jet, the 90-seat ARJ21, flew its first commercial flight in June after years of delays. Russian Helicopters to sell three helicopters to Chinese company Moscow (UPI) Nov 2, 2016 - Russian Helicopters announced Wednesday it will sell three helicopters to China's Jiangsu Baoli Aviation Equipment Co. The Rostec subsidiary will deliver Mi-171A, Ansat and a Ka-32 helicopters to the company in a deal revealed during the Airshow China 2016, Russian Helicopters said in a statement. Jiangsu Baoli will receive an Ansat light helicopter in a medevac configuration, along with the other two, next year. Russian Helicopters has established partnerships with the company. A contract for four Ka-32s was signed in 2015, with all deliveries slated to be completed by mid-2017. The aircraft will be used for firefighting, while the Ka-32s can also maneuver in the wilderness and land at unprepared zones. China already operates more than 350 Mi-8/Mi-17 helicopters. Ka-32s of various configurations are already in use in Spain, Portugal, Colombia, Switzerland, Canada, South Korea, Taiwan, Japan and others. Aerospace giants Boeing and Airbus took potshots at one another at the Zhuhai air show, as the US and European rivals seek to capture more of China's booming aircraft market. China is one of the Western manufacturers' key battlegrounds, with its travellers taking to the skies in ever-growing numbers. The country's airlines will need nearly 6,000 new planes worth $945 billion over the next two decades, Airbus said in its 2016-2035 Global Market Forecast. Boeing's expectations are even more optimistic, for 6,800 aircraft costing $1 trillion. To win favour locally both have built partnerships with Chinese firms. Airbus has a completion and delivery centre in Tianjin, where workers install furnishings and apply paint to aircraft for the domestic market. It also buys parts such as exit doors, brake blades and wing sections from Chinese suppliers. Boeing is planning to open a facility with the state-owned Commercial Aircraft Corp. of China (COMAC) to paint and install cabins for 737-model planes, the Chinese firm said. Eric Chen, president of Airbus China, dismissed the Seattle firm's plan as "close to one generation" behind his own firm, saying it was following Airbus's strategy "with a lot of reluctance". "I got two impressions," he said at a briefing at the China Airshow in Zhuhai, the industry's biggest event in the country. "First one, the decision we made 10 years ago was right. The second impression is that we are well in advance of our competitor." Darren Hulst, managing director for Northeast Asia marketing at Boeing, earlier told reporters that the Airbus A350 fell short of the 787 widebody plane in range, capacity, carbon emissions, window size and aerodynamics. "The 787 is capable and has technology and features built into it that are not available on the A350, which was obviously introduced later into the market," he said. He added the company had 14 China deliveries of 787-9s in 2016 and had secured orders and commitments for 46 more. - Future rivals - While the two megafirms see a sunny future in China, homegrown competitors backed by Beijing aim to beat them at home -- and ultimately abroad. Chinese authorities have urged companies to acquire technology and skills in a range of high-value sectors including aerospace in the "Made in China 2025" plan. At the same time as it is working with both Boeing and Airbus, COMAC is developing single-aisle jets to compete with them. Its C919 narrow-body is going up against the Boeing 737 and Airbus A320 in the 160-seat segment, which the Chinese company predicts will have more than 17,000 deliveries over the next 20 years. In Zhuhai COMAC announced that state-owned China Eastern Airlines had committed to buy 20 C919s. In the summer COMAC's regional jet, the 90-seat ARJ21, flew its first commercial flight after years of delays. Boeing, Airbus and Canadian regional builder Bombardier all played down the threat of Chinese competition. But the business climate has darkened for US and European firms in the country, with the American Chamber of Commerce in China reporting this year that more than three-quarters of survey respondents felt "less welcome" there. Pessimism among European companies hit an all-time high in the summer, according to a European Chamber of Commerce in China report on the "increasingly hostile" business climate. Chinese-built planes are sure to secure market share in the country, Eric Lin, Hong Kong-based director of Asia transport research with UBS Securities, told AFP. In the short term, he added, foreign firms have little to fear from Chinese rivals in the developed countries that are their home market. "But after 10 years, it's hard to say," he noted. China has a history of adapting foreign technology with remarkable swiftness, turning from a buyer of Russian military aircraft to a producer of advanced stealth jets in 20 years. Its high speed rail and clean energy industries went from collaborators to competitors faster than global rivals anticipated. Like all foreign firms with valuable intellectual property operating in China, the aerospace giants understand the risks of training their future rivals, said Christopher Balding, professor of economics at Peking University's HSBC Business School. But they are stuck between a rock and a hard place, he added, because shareholders want them to fight for Chinese market share. "Even if they don't come to China, there's a good chance that if they are doing anything innovative it's going to get stolen anyway, so the only thing they are doing is harming their revenue." bfc/slb/sm BOEING AIRBUS GROUP HSBC UBS GROUP AG BOMBARDIER Tweet Related Links Aerospace News at SpaceMart.com Subscribe free to our newsletters via your Email Address SPACE DAILY SPACE WAR TERRA DAILY ENERGY NEWS MARS DAILY GPS DAILY SEED DAILY WIND DAILY DISASTER NEWS SOLAR ENERGY MEDICAL NEWS NUCLEAR NEWS OIL & GAS NEWS BIO FUEL DAILY Buy Advertising Editorial Enquiries Uber lays out vision for flying commuter transit San Francisco (AFP) Oct 28, 2016 Uber on Thursday laid out a vision for on-demand aircraft that can whisk commuters to home or work in a fraction of the time it would take on the road.

The hugely ambitious plan was first agreed between the Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (Comac) and Russia’s United Aircraft Corporation (UAC), whose products include the Sukhoi Superjet 100, in June when Russian President Vladimir Putin met his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping in Beijing.

Swiss International Airlines, Kuwait Airways and Flydubai have raised BAC's portfolio of airline customers to 23 and is boosting utilisation of its production capacities which can churn out some 40,000 meals a day. BAC, Thailand's second-largest in-flight catering service provider, started serving Kuwait and Swiss on Oct 31 and Nov 1, respectively, and will begin its service for Flydubai on Nov 28. The deals are for three years. BAC managing director Linus Knobel told the Bangkok Post that the inclusion of the three airline clients reflect their trust in the company's product and services and competitive bidding. Part of Bangkok Airways Group, the catering company is now vying for contracts to serve Qantas Airways, Pakistan International Airlines and a few other carriers that make Suvarnabhumi their port of call. Having Swiss on board is a good credential for BAC , whose clientele include some of the world's top carriers such as Emirates, Qatar Airways and Turkish Airlines, said Mr Knobel. BAC caters for the Swiss airline's daily flights on the Bangkok-Zurich route, operated by Boeing 777-300ERs; Kuwait's six flights weekly on Bangkok-Kuwait with Airbus 330 and 340 series; and Flydubai's two daily flights on Bangkok-Dubai with Boeing's 737-800 single-aisle jets. Mr Knobel said BAC's facilities at Suvarnabhumi can raise its output to as many as 50,000 meals a day if demand requires. It can add another 5,000 meals a day in a relatively short term, he added. The company's largest airline customers in terms of sales are Bangkok Airways, Emirates, Qatar and Turkish, respectively, he said. BAC facilities, which have been running for 10 years, have three separate kitchens that prepare foods conforming to kosher and halal regulations to meet the needs of airlines such as El Al Israel and Emirates.

Skip to content Repeating Islands News and commentary on Caribbean culture, literature, and the arts Toggle Sidebar November 3, 2016November 3, 2016 Jumbo Jet Makes its Last Run of ‘World’s Scariest Landing’ in St. Maarten [Many thanks to Peter Jordens for bringing this item to our attention.] Jeffrey Cook (ABC News) reports that “one of the world’s scariest landings” will no longer take place in St. Maarten: For 26 years, a tropical paradise has been home to one of the world’s scariest and most exhilarating landings in the world. Today, that era came to an end. The last KLM Boeing 747 touched down in St. Maarten at 11:03 a.m. ET today. Since 1990, Dutch airline KLM has served beach goers hair-raising landings as their jumbo jets soared at low altitudes over the sandy coast and onto the runways at Princess Juliana International Airport. Going forward, the route to St. Maarten will be served by Airbus A330s, seating 243 passengers, as oppose to the 408 passengers that fit into the Boeing 747. The flight from Amsterdam used to make a stop to drop off passengers in Curacao in addition to St. Maarten.  KLM will now fly three direct flights a week from Amsterdam to St. Maarten and seven to Curacao. Aviation enthusiasts have dubbed the experience as one of the world’s scariest landings and will certainly be lamenting the end of an era.

Log In or Register to post comments Goforride on Nov 7, 2016 Is a company, or an individual, supposed to make business decisions that are to their personal detriment, but for the collective good? Isn't that what they said in Nazi Germany or the Soviet Union? Sacrifice for the collective good? Seeing as how Boeing is at a disadvantage relative to Airbus because Airbus has actual assembly facility in China (as it does in Alabama), I would think you'd be pleased that Boeing is letting China do the interior finish work, like putting in the carpet, and keeping the manufacturing in the US, rather than doing the whole assembly in China as their competition does.

If Zhejiang is a prosperous part of China with higher wages than the Chinese average, couldn't this work have been done in an economically depressed area here in the states? The 'Rust Belt' states, or even at the 787 plant in SC? Log In or Register to post comments dracsilva@gmail.com on Nov 4, 2016 Somehow this will transfer technology to China in the future will be a strong competitor and will make good much cheaper products. Ideally the US build its aircraft within the country. If the problem is the cost and the unions, change the laws! Later Boeing will regret this adventure overseas. (sorry for my bad english).

Log In or Register to post comments sioussat@gmail.com on Nov 8, 2016 If you try to find well trained, experienced aircraft assembly, tooling, machinist's, electronic tech's etc. etc, personnel in the US good luck. The good old USA has abandoned most of it's apprenticeship programs and most major trade school program's in favor of sending or kids to very expensive 4 year schools so they can learn something totally useless AND be in debt for years. At the rate we are going NOTHING will be built here. Log In or Register to post comments PITmech on Nov 8, 2016 The military trains many aircraft mechanics, some go on to tech schools, where are all the jobs for them? Going overseas and elsewhere? Where do these non US technicians get trained? If the job outsourcing continues we will have no technicians, Food stamps and welfare for all.

Skip to content Satellite Press Releases Satellite Press Releases and News UCLA Anderson School of Management Honors Retired Boeing Chairman, President and CEO W. James McNerney, Jr., Awarded 2016 John Wooden Global Leadership Award LOS ANGELES–(BUSINESS WIRE)–UCLA Anderson School of Management honored W. James (Jim) McNerney, Jr., retired chairman, president and CEO of The Boeing Company, with the 2016 John Wooden Global Leadership Award on Nov. 2, 2016, at a banquet held at the California Science Center in Los Angeles. The award, named for legendary UCLA basketball coach, author and leadership expert John Wooden (1910–2010), is given each year to an exceptional individual in corporate America whose leadership style and service to the community reflect the same high benchmarks of performance, integrity and ethical values set by Wooden. McNerney was selected as this year’s recipient for the exceptional leadership he has displayed throughout his career at some of the world’s largest and most iconic companies, including General Electric, 3M and, most recently, Boeing, where he served as chairman, president and CEO for a decade. “It would be difficult to identify another executive who has delivered as superb results across such complex global businesses as Jim McNerney,” said UCLA Anderson Dean Judy Olian. “Whether at GE, 3M or Boeing, Jim was laser focused on culture, process and integrity – with fantastic results that followed. It’s about winning, the right way, just like Coach Wooden demonstrated in his decades of coaching and teaching.” Over the course of his career, McNerney has received numerous honors and recognitions, including being named “CEO of the Year” in 2015 by Chief Executive magazine and the 2008 National Management Association’s Executive of the Year. By appointment of U.S. President Barack Obama, he serves on the Kennedy Center Board of Trustees. He previously chaired the President’s Export Council. He serves on the board of trustees of the Washington, D.C.-based Center for Strategic and International Studies, and he is a past chair and previous member of the executive committee of Business Roundtable. He also is a past chair of the US-China Business Council. He is a director of Procter & Gamble, a director of IBM, a member of The Field Museum Board of Trustees in Chicago, a trustee of Northwestern University, the chair of the Northwestern Memorial HealthCare Board and of the Kellogg School Dean’s Advisory Board. “John Wooden’s way of going about things is envious,” said McNerney. “I loved watching his teams and the way every individual found his or her potential, yet the team was the best team on the floor. I understand the connection between individual and team achievement and making it all work.” Previous John Wooden Global Leadership Honorees include: Ursula Burns (chairman and CEO, Xerox), Paul E. Jacobs (executive chairman, Qualcomm), Robert Iger (chairman and CEO, Disney), Indra Nooyi (chairman and CEO, PepsiCo), Peter Ueberroth (managing director, Contrarian Group, and president of the Los Angeles Olympics Organizing Committee), Frederick Smith (president and CEO, FedEx), Kenneth Chenault (chairman and CEO, American Express Company) and Howard Schultz (chairman, president and CEO, Starbucks). Net proceeds from the event fund fellowships for UCLA Anderson students who embody Coach Wooden’s leadership ideals and commitment to improving the lives of others. Each of the four 2016 John Wooden Global Leadership Fellows receive a $25,000 fellowship: Corey McMillen (MBA ’17) Datra Oliver (FEMBA ’18) Doug Larratt (EMBA ’17) Eric Potocek (FEMBA ’18) “One of our primary goals is to educate and develop future generations of global leaders,” said Dean Olian. “The John Wooden Global Leadership Award ceremony furthers that goal in several ways. First, the leadership examples set by both Coach Wooden and Jim McNerney serve as inspiration for all of our students. Awarding the Wooden Fellowships to our most deserving recipients assists the fellows as they pursue their own dreams and passions.” About the John Wooden Global Leadership Award As the most winning coach in men’s college basketball, Wooden’s legacy of leadership transcends athletics and spans generations. As a coach, prolific author and inspiring speaker, he dedicated his life to motivating individuals to achieve their highest potential. Wooden instilled in others a sense of pride, a commitment to ethics and a respect for teamwork. UCLA Anderson extends these fundamental principles and Wooden’s famous Pyramid of Success into the classroom through the Wooden Global Leadership Program.

James (“Jim”) McNerney Jr., as the 10th recipient of the John Wooden Global Leadership Award. An audience of nearly 500 that included UCLA Anderson supporters and Coach Wooden’s daughter Nan and son Jim gathered Wednesday under and around the Space Shuttle Endeavour at the California Science Center. “I’m deeply honored by this award,” McNerney said after receiving it from UCLA Anderson Dean Judy Olian. “John Wooden — if you’re of my generation, you know who he is, what he meant and what his values were. The prior (recipients) — I know them all, and I’m very proud to be included in that group.” The distinction is awarded annually to an exceptional leader who espouses and embodies the principles exemplified by the legendary UCLA coach, teacher and leadership expert. Olian expressed admiration for McNerney’s decades of business success, which in 2015 earned him recognition as CEO of the Year by Chief Executive magazine. In a featured conversation with Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist from the Los Angeles Times Michael Hiltzik, McNerney talked about the current state of manufacturing in the United States. “Manufactuing, when you look at the numbers, has been down,” McNerney said. “But we are entering a place that should be a sweet spot for us. Technology is unlocking cost improvement, delivery and customization through digitization and automation. We’re exiting a period where we were disadvantaged but entering a period where technology and digitization are taking over. If we can grab that, we have a chance to regain our leadership.” With dozens of UCLA Anderson students and alumni in attendance in mind, Hiltzik queried McNerney about the qualities it takes to reach the upper echelons of management. “By the time you’re ready for a job at the top, you have a threshold cap on hard skills,” McNerney said, referencing decision-making and investment strategies. “(At that point), the softer skills become more important. How do you motivate people, how do you work with a team to define a new culture, how do you push people [while] motivating them? It’s a lot more leadership, communication, alignment — dealing with gray areas outside the company. It’s more about being able to handle the unstructured environment. Those skills are the differentiators.” The annual tribute to Coach Wooden was delivered by two-time American Basketball Association All-Star Swen Nater, who played on two of Coach Wooden’s title teams, and UCLA head women’s basketball coach Cori Close. Close recalled her first meeting with Coach Wooden when she was an aspiring assistant at UCLA in the 1990s. “I was so insecure going into that room,” she said. Yet, she said, “I felt seen, I felt cared for, I felt valued. People were always more important to him than things.” Nater lauded Coach for the example of humility and respectfulness he set. “When the UCLA team went on the road, we wore blue blazers and blue and gold ties, and we left the locker room cleaner than when we found it.” That resulted in hank you notes from custodians, praising the team’s consideration. “UCLA was the only team that did this,” he said. Nater has penned at least 100 poems in homage to Coach. Among his succinct observations of what his mentor taught him, Nater said, “Beyond the ‘how,’ I learned the ‘why.’” Proceeds from the dinner fund four $25,000 John Wooden Leadership Fellowships, given this year to UCLA Anderson students Doug Larratt, Corey McMillen, Datra Oliver and Eric Potocek.

ShareTweet Published November 3, 2016, 10:00 PM NEW PLANE MODELS ON DISPLAY – Models of an ARJ-21 jet is presented by Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC) at an air show, the China International Aviation and Aerospace Exhibition, in Zhuhai, Guangdong Province, China, November 1, 2016. (Reuters) By Reuters Zhuhai, China,– China and Russia took a step closer on Wednesday to the joint development of a long-haul jet to challenge Boeing and Airbus, displaying a model of the unnamed plane that would compete with Western rivals. State-owned planemakers Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC) and United Aircraft Corp. (UAC) of Russia said they had started the hunt to find suppliers, as they presented a mock-up of the wide-body jet at Airshow China. Neither firm gave details on financing or technical specifications for what Western analysts call a politically-driven initiative that will be difficult to pull off and is likely to carry a high price tag. China opened the show on Tuesday in the southern city of Zhuhai with a brief flypast of its J-20 stealth fighter, in a demonstration of military clout. Both countries are currently developing smaller narrow-body jets to compete with the best-selling Airbus and Boeing types. Guo Bozhi, general manager of COMAC’s widebody department, said a 50-50 joint venture based in Shanghai will start operations this year. First announced in 2014, the project has so far been slow to materialize. The firms have said they want to conduct a maiden flight in 2022 and begin deliveries in 2025 or later. Western industry analysts consider the target challenging, but more realistic than recent aircraft programs that sought results in 5-7 years and came in late. “A wide-body jet is an extremely complicated product, which will require a lot of skills (to develop) and require broad industrial knowledge,” Guo told reporters. “China and Russia each have their own advantages.” Descriptions accompanying the model showed the firms ultimately envision three variants, based on a basic version that will seat 280 and have a range of up to 12,000 kilometers (7,500 miles). The decision to base the venture in Shanghai was a “mutual decision,” Guo said at the event, attended by COMAC Chairman Jin Zhuanglong, UAC’s Chief Executive Yury Slyusar and Russia’s Minister of Trade and Industry Denis Manturov. Guo declined to say how much each party had invested in the project. A global effort to assess potential suppliers is now under way, said COMAC, which is separately pushing its own C919 narrow-body passenger jet towards a long-delayed maiden flight, now aimed for the end of 2016 or early 2017. US firms Honeywell and United Technologies Corporation said on Wednesday they discussed the China-Russia jet with COMAC officials at the airshow, without commenting on the nature or subject of the contacts. “We will choose suppliers who have rich experience in development, whose products are competitive globally, and who can continually guarantee quality from the development stage until the planes go into operation,” Guo said. A key decision will be what engines to use. Industry sources speculate the jet could use Western engines. Another potentially tricky issue will be how the work should be divided, a subject which caused years of wrangling at Europe’s Airbus, which began in 1970 as a consortium of nations and took more than two decades to make a significant impact. Though a 50-50 JV, analysts view the Chinese side as being the more influential in the project. The firm’s Shanghai headquarters tells “where the balance of power is going to be and that reflects the size of the Chinese domestic market,” said Sash Tusa, analyst at London-based consultancy Agency Partners.

The two companies signed an initial agreement in March 2012, and have been researching ways to improve aviation´s fuel efficiency and greenhouse-gas emissions reduction, including sustainable aviation biofuel and air traffic management (ATM) efficiency. Through this new agreement, signed at the Zhuhai Airshow, the companies will explore six areas of mutually beneficial research through the renamed Boeing-COMAC Sustainable Aviation Technology Center. They will also continue to exchange commercial aviation market forecasts. Boeing and COMAC plan to open a joint venture facility in Zhoushan, China, that will install interiors and paint 737s before Boeing delivers these airplanes to Chinese customers.

Meanwhile, the authorities consider renting two large ATR aircraft that would provide greater flexibility to the existing fleet, reports local News.ro. The privatization is just the last among other options for a company that has recorded nine consecutive years of losses, the minister added. Boeing and Airbus are considered for providing high-capacity aircraft whereas Embraer, ATR, and Bombardier are considered for small capacity airplanes. In the last years Tarom representatives have repeatedly said that it was necessary to replace the company’s fleet. Tarom airplanes have an average age of over 15 years, which significantly increases the maintenance and operating costs. In recent months, some Tarom flights have registered big delays while others have been cancelled due to technical problems. Tarom recently decommissioned its two Airbus 310 aircraft, which had been bought in 1992 and gave up some routes, including Dubai. The company now has a fleet of 22 aircraft from three producers: Airbus, ATR, and Boeing. editor@romania-insider.com Romania Insider Search on the web You might also be interested in these stories Bucharest Stock Exchange group sees higher results in third quarter 11 Nov 2016business Bucharest authorities plan to take more measures to solve the traffic problem 11 Nov 2016social President: Romania’s union with Moldova is possible, but not in the near future 10 Nov 2016politics Trade deficit with agri-food products reaches EUR 0.5 bln in Romania 14 Nov 2016business Health and family, the most important things for 99% of Romanians 15 Nov 2016social Romanian retailer eMAG partners with E.On to sell cheaper electricity on Black Friday 15 Nov 2016business Facebook Comments Romania Insider Newsletter Stay in touch with all that matters to you with our free daily newsletter.

New deliveries of passenger and freight aircraft for China will be close to 6,000 over the next 20 years, including 4,230 single aisle aircraft, and 1,740 wide-body aircraft, according to Airbus' 2016-2035 Global Market Forecast, released at the ongoing 11th China International Aviation & Aerospace Exhibition in Zhuhai, south China's Guangdong Province. Airbus rival Boeing is also optimistic about the Chinese market, with president of Boeing China John Bruns saying that China will become the world's first air market with a market value exceeding one trillion U.S. dollars. Airbus forecasts that China will need nearly 6,000 new passenger aircraft and freighters from 2016 to 2035, with a total market value of 945 billion U.S. dollars. It represents 18 percent of the world total demand in the next 20 years. "In the next 20 years, China will need more than 1,000 aircraft with 70 to 130 seats," said Guo Qing, vice president of Sales and Marketing, Commercial Aviation, Embraer China. Brazil's Embraer has big shares in regional air transportation market. "People's travelling needs are rising, which has brought huge opportunities for regional air transportation," he said. China will become the lead country for passenger air traffic, for both domestic and international markets, as passenger traffic in China will grow well above the world average rate, and will be the focal point for five of the top twenty traffic flows worldwide, according to Airbus. With aviation continuing to prove an extremely efficient way to move people and goods around the country, domestic air traffic in China will become the world's number one traffic flow growing at over three times from today level. Flows between China and the United States, Europe and Asia are expected to be amongst the fastest growing globally, with average annual growth rates 6.8 percent, 5.3 percent and 6.7 percent respectively. Between 2015 and 2035, the average annual growth rate for all international traffic from/to the Chinese mainland is forecast to be 6.7 percent. Domestic passenger traffic on the Chinese Mainland has quadrupled over the last 10 years, and China is set to become the world's number one aviation market, said John Leahy, Airbus Chief Operating Officer Customers. "In the next 20 years, the greatest demand for passenger aircraft will come from China," he said. China's rising middle-class, combined with agreements to ease travel between China and other major markets, are contributing to an outbound tourism boom. According to the China National Tourism Administration, the number of China's outbound tourists exceeded 100 million last year. By 2035, the propensity for the Chinese population to fly will grow from 0.3 trips per capita today, to 1.3, a higher level than the whole of Europe's propensity to fly today, Airbus predicted. Amid intense competition, China's Commercial Aircraft Corporation (COMAC) of China is ready to grab a share of the market. On Wednesday, the company and Russia's United Aircraft Corporation unveiled a jointly-developed wide-body aircraft model. The 280-seat aircraft is expected to make its maiden flight in 2023. "We will focus on the growing global aviation industry with our aircraft," said Guo Bozhi, assistant to COMAC's General Manager. "Of course, China will always be one of the most important markets for us."

The Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC) and Russia's United Aircraft Corporation (UAC) unveiled a one-tenth scale model of a wide-body civilian aircraft at the ongoing Airshow China in Zhuhai, South China's Guangdong Province, with experts saying that the two countries have strong complementarities in technology and market to bring the vision into reality. This cooperation is based on a contract signed in June witnessed by Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin during Putin's visit to Beijing. According to a COMAC press release, the long-haul plane, with 280 seats, will have a range of 12,000 kilometers. The advanced aerodynamic design will use composite materials and a new generation high-bypass turbofan engine to obtain maximum performance. "Based on our experience of the research and production process, from the start it will take seven years to get to the first test flight, and 10 years to formally deliver to our client," COMAC noted. While the new aircraft has not yet been named, and it has not been decided which engine will be used, UAC President Yury Slyusar said he has strong confidence in the joint project with China, having previously told Russian media that the new plane will compete with the Boeing 787 and Air Bus 350. Lower operating costs will mean competitive pricing for the aircraft, with Slyusar saying it will have around a 10 percent advantage on the cost compared with its competitors. Slyusar told the Global Times on Wednesday that the total value of this program is approximately U.S.-20 billion, and China and Russia will split the bill. "COMAC has outstanding technology and designs and we will not only cooperate in technology but also in intellectual property," he said. The joint venture will not be an exclusive Sino-Russian project, and will be open to world suppliers, the press release said. It will outsource to experienced suppliers of technologies and quality systems globally to share the risks, it said, and encourages suppliers to manufacture locally. Maurice Boon, Officer for Science and Technology at the Netherlands Embassy in China, was in the audience at the unveiling ceremony. He told the Global Times that "maybe Dutch companies can join the program and provide component supply services." Colossal challenge Qi Qi, an associate professor with Guangzhou Civil Aviation College, said it will be a colossal challenge for the joint venture to be accepted by the world market. The new plane will have to be tested for safety standards, operational and maintenance costs, before entering the international market. "Only those accepted by the international market will be deemed as successful models, so the joint venture must closely observe trends in the global aviation market," Qi said. "It takes time to accumulate experience to achieve certain levels of craftsmanship," he said. Airbus Group said at the air show that its A330 factory in Tianjin will deliver the first Tianjin-made A330 aircraft in September next year. A representative from Boeing told the Global Times Wednesday that the market is big enough for new competitors, and that healthy competition is conducive to the industry, which will prompt all manufacturers to produce innovative products to meet market demands. Lin Zhijie, an expert in passenger planes, noted that China boasts advantages as aircraft manufacturing is a national strategic industry with huge investment from the government, and Russia has a sound basis for the design and manufacturing of wide-bodied planes and engines. COMAC has already had success with its previous star product, the C919 passenger plane. Shanghai-based China Eastern Airlines became the first buyer to take delivery of the China-made single-aisle 168-seat passenger jet on Tuesday at the air show, although the first test flights might not be until early 2017, COMAC said Tuesday, adding that China Eastern may then put in an order for five more planes. COMAC also signed an agreement with Shanghai-based aircraft leasing company SPDB Financial Leasing Tuesday, and received five confirmed orders and 15 international orders. So far, COMAC has received over 570 orders of C919 from 23 customers.

Debris drift pattern simulation from the ATSB's new report on MH 370 3 Nov 2016 at 01:03, Simon Sharwood Simon Sharwood Get email alert when this author posts Common Topics Cloud, Security , Australia, Vmware, Microsoft Recent Articles Angry user demands three site visits to fix email address typos Russia to block LinkedIn over data domiciling issues What strange madness is this? Microsoft makes patch data RESTful The Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) has published a new report (PDF) on the likely fate flight MH 370, the Malaysian Airlines Boeing 777 missing since March 8th, 2014. The new analysis considers three things: the last handshake between the plane and Satcom satellites; the condition of debris from the plane, and; experiments aimed at figuring out how debris from the plane made it across the Indian ocean. As we've previously reported, the MH 370 search area was chosen by analysing seven satellite handshakes. . The new analysis of the seventh handshake suggests the plane was experiencing “a high and increasing rate of descent”. That conclusion is based on analysis of “burst frequency offset” (BFO), which the report explains “is a function of the Doppler shifts imparted on the communication signal due to the motion of the satellite and the aircraft.” Analysing BFO “can provide information about the relative motion between the satellite and the aircraft.” The report offers tremendous detail on BFO and how to use it in the case of MH370, and also reveals that the ATSB used BFO analysis to cook up new scenarios for Boeing to test in 777 simulators. Those efforts suggest MH 370 was heading down, and quickly, when it made its seventh handshake. Which leads to the notion that a sharp, rapid, descent could have seen the plane hit the ocean to the north of the current search area which was defined on the basis of previous analyses suggesting slower descents. Analysis of debris from the plane is also instructive, as it suggests the 777's flaps were retracted as is the case during normal flight. When the plane is landing the flaps are extended, so the finding of retracted flaps suggests MH370 was not being manoeuvred at low speed and therefore that flight crew were not attempting a soft landing on water. Drift pattern analysis is also considered, with replica plane parts having been set adrift in the Indian Ocean to see where they end up. To date these efforts have been inconclusive as some analyses suggest that the debris originated to the North of the search zone, while others suggest a more northerly impact point is not feasible. The ATSB has devoted three days to considering the report, an effort that will be closely watched by families of those aboard the fateful flight and the aviation industry as both have recently asked that the search for the plane be continued. The ATSB and authorities from Malaysia and China have previously said the search for the plane will be concluded once a survey of the currently-designated search area is complete. But if the new report turns up evidence suggesting the search zone should be expanded, it is possible the search will be extended. The current search is nearly complete, with 110,000km2 of the 120,000km2 search zone already surveyed without success. ® Sponsored: 10 Reasons LinuxONE is the best choice for Linux workloads Tips and corrections 38 Comments More from The Register MH-370 search loses sharpest-eyed robot deep beneath the waves China-supplied 'towfish' only went to sea in February 63 Comments We're not looking for MH370 in the wrong place say investigators Glide-path theory debunked by the company that raised it 69 Comments Flight sim records show MH370 captain practiced 'flight' near search area Might pretend airports favoured by flight sim fans defeat nefarious intent theories? 54 Comments New MH370 search zone picked using just seven satellite 'handshakes' First and seventh pings from plane indicate power interruptions 86 Comments Passport PIN tech could have SAVED MH370 ID fraudsters Integrated keypad security?

State-owned planemakers Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC) and United Aircraft Corp (UAC) of Russia said they have started the hunt to find suppliers as they presented the mock-up of the widebody jet for the first time in public at a ceremony during Airshow China, the country's biggest air expo. But executives of both firms at the event offered no concrete details on financing and few technical specifications for a project that Western analysts have said is highly ambitious, difficult to pull off and likely to carry a high price. Guo Bozhi, general manager of COMAC's widebody department, said a 50-50 joint venture based in Shanghai would start operations this year. First announced in 2014, the project has been kept largely secret, though the companies have said that they want conduct a maiden flight in 2022 and begin deliveries in 2025 -- targets Western industry analysts consider unlikely, saying widebody jets can take decades rather than years to develop. "A widebody jet is an extremely complicated product, which will require a lot of skills (to develop) and require broad industrial knowledge," Guo told reporters. "China and Russia each have their own advantages." Descriptions accompanying the model showed the firms ultimately envision three variants of the aircraft, based on a basic version that will hold 280 seats with a range of up to 12,000 kilometres. The decision to base the venture in Shanghai was a "mutual decision" Guo said at the event, attended by COMAC chairman Jin Zhuanglong, UAC's chief executive Yury Slyusar as well as Russia's Minister of Trade and Industry Denis Manturov. Guo declined to say how much each party had invested in the project. A global effort to search for and assess potential suppliers is now under way, said COMAC, which is separately occupied with pushing its own C919 narrow-body passenger jet towards a long-delayed maiden flight, now aimed for the end of 2016 or early 2017. US firms Honeywell International Inc and United Technologies Corp said yesterday that they discussed the China-Russia jet with COMAC officials at the airshow, without commenting on the nature nor the subject of the contacts. "We will choose suppliers who have rich experience in development, whose products are competitive globally, and who can continually guarantee quality from the development stage until the planes go into operation," Guo said. Though a 50-50 JV, analysts view the Chinese side as being the more influential in the project. "The firm's Shanghai headquarters tells where the balance of power is going to be and that reflects the size of the Chinese domestic market," said Sash Tusa, analyst at London-based consultancy Agency Partners. "The volumes for a widebody jet are far smaller than for a narrow body ... so I think suppliers are going to be much more careful about this than for the (COMAC) C919," he said.  RECOMMENDED STORIES Thais hold off Aussies to draw 2-2 Rice-pledge loss list names 6,000 officials 8 trawlers sunk to create artificial reef Ariya, Thongchai favourites for SAT title City cleans 6 tonnes of krathong waste Baby boy rescued, newborn's body found dumped Renewables have their day in the sun Police nab suspect after 6-year chase Thailand shock Australia with 2-2 draw Most Viewed 119,504 Pattaya-Hua Hin ferry to begin on ... 42,539 'Supermoon' vigils set to honour ... 39,613 Philippine, Myanmar heads pay ... 34,527 Fresh attacks 'kill dozens' in ... 27,644 Two dead after NZ quake, tsunami ...

A disk within the General Electric Co. CF6-80 engine had an “internal inclusion,” meaning some type of foreign debris was embedded within the special alloy designed to withstand the heat and high stresses of a jet engine, the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board said in a statement. GE believes it has identified the “limited number” of disks manufactured at the same time that may have the same flaw and only one other remains in operation, the company said in a letter Friday to carriers. “We are currently working with the operator to accomplish removal of the remaining part in service,” said the letter, obtained by Bloomberg. The NTSB statement didn’t say whether the flaw posed a risk in other engines. GE didn’t immediately respond to an e-mailed request for comment. In a statement earlier Friday, GE said it hasn’t experienced such a failure in parts made with the same alloy in more than 30 years. There are more than 4,000 of the various CF6 engines in service and they’ve flown more than 400 million hours, GE said. “Given the number of incidents that have occurred, I wouldn’t say it rises to the level of a fleet issue,” said Robert Mann, president of aviation consultant R.W. Mann & Co. “But it’s something they obviously have to think about -- how that occurred, why that occurred.” GE and the unnamed supplier of the Inconel 718 alloy, commonly used in the hot section of engines, are reviewing production records for NTSB investigators, GE said in a statement. O’Hare Airport The 170 people aboard American Airlines Flight 383, a Boeing Co. 767 at Chicago’s O’Hare International, raced out of left-side exits after an orange fireball erupted on the right of the plane. The engine had blown up during a takeoff attempt, triggering a fuel leak and the fire. At least 20 people suffered minor injuries during the evacuation, according to the NTSB.

You will now receive the Game Plan newsletter The CF6-80 engine failed so violently that pieces of the spinning disk flew 2,920 feet (890 meters) away, striking a warehouse, the NTSB said in a briefing Saturday. Jet engines are encased in armor and have other safeguards to ensure that shrapnel can’t escape in a failure, so the NTSB will try to determine why those protections failed. The plane was accelerating for takeoff and pilots were able to stop on the ground before lifting off. American Airlines declined to comment because of the continuing investigation, said Ross Feinstein, a spokesman for the carrier. The disk, located in the rear portion of the engine, where burning fuel races past fan blades to spin the turbine, broke into at least four pieces, according to NTSB. It was designed to withstand at least 15,000 startups and had only been used 10,984 times, the NTSB said. In its letter to operators of the same engine model, GE said it had identified “a material anomaly” that appeared to be linked to the failure. “Although the investigation is still under way, a limited number of closely related CF6-80C2 parts have already been identified, only one of which is still in operation,” GE said in the letter. The engine involved in the American fire was built in 1997, according to GE. “Since the 1970s, the GE CF6 engine has been one of the workhorse jet engines of the airline industry, powering seven widebody commercial jets models with industry-leading levels of reliability,” GE said in its earlier release. 100 Million It has been used on many aircraft, including the Airbus Group SE A330 and Boeing’s MD-11, 747 and 767. The power plants have accumulated more than 100 million flights since their introduction, according to the company. While there have been dozens of safety alerts on various models of the engine issued by NTSB or the Federal Aviation Administration, none in the past 10 years appear to have zeroed in on the component that failed, according to agency records. The American flight had accelerated to 154 miles (248 kilometers) an hour before the pilots began applying the brakes, according to NTSB. It came to a stop about 25 seconds later. Fire crews arrived on scene and started applying foam to the burning jet fuel within 2 minutes and 51 seconds of being notified of the emergency, NTSB said. The fire burned so hot that the right wing partially collapsed. Southwest Incident If contamination exists within metal structures, that can weaken them and allow a crack to form, according to previous NTSB investigations. Repeatedly flexing or stressing the crack can cause it to grow in what is known as fatigue cracking. The NTSB said it found evidence of fatigue in the CF6 disk fragments it examined. The NTSB is also investigating another so-called uncontained engine failure that occurred on Aug. 27 on a Southwest Airlines Co. plane, which was forced to make an emergency landing in Pensacola, Florida. The CFM56 engine in the Southwest incident was built by CFM International Inc., a joint venture between GE and Safran SA. The CFM56 family, used on narrowbody aircraft, is separate from the CF6.

Back to site Election 2016 Climate Change Carbon tax The Carbon Tax on the Ballot in Washington State Is Not the Right Way to Deal With Global Warming A revenue-neutral carbon tax simply cannot deliver the massive green-energy investments we all need. By Naomi KleinTwitter November 4, 2016 Facebook Twitter Email Print Smoke rising from the Eggborough Power Station. (John Giles / PA Wire) The imperatives of the climate crisis and the logic of economic austerity are at war—and Washington State is on the front lines.1 Ad Policy So-called “revenue-neutral” carbon pricing—whereby the proceeds are used to fund tax cuts—has long been a cherished hobbyhorse of free-market economists and the odd Republican who favors climate action. It’s also the policy of choice for big polluters like ExxonMobil. And now this right-wing friendly model is being pushed in Washington State, thanks to Initiative 732.2 I-732, on the ballot on November 8, would be the first revenue-neutral price on carbon in the United States. It is widely unpopular among the state’s Democrats, Republicans, and even the business lobby, and has only managed to win the support of one significant environmental group. But on the off chance it is approved by voters, it would be a disastrous precedent that could set back the climate justice movement for a decade—time that we simply can’t afford to lose.3 Some have accepted the logic that something is better than nothing, even arguing that a “tax swap” could substitute for a just transition to a low-carbon economy. The evidence proves otherwise. In British Columbia, two-thirds of the tax cuts have ended up in corporate pockets, while carbon emissions have been rising in recent years and the fracking industry has boomed.4 By some estimates, I-732 would raise gasoline and electricity prices less than 15 percent by 2040 in Washington State—hardly enough to jumpstart an urgent, sweeping phase-out of fossil fuels. Meanwhile, it would offset carbon revenues by cutting taxes for big corporations, including major polluters. (According to the Seattle Times, Boeing could see windfalls of tens of millions annually.) 5 And while polluters get rewarded, the communities of color that have born the brunt of fossil fuel pollution, and the working people whose jobs are at risk as we move away from fossil fuels, are left empty handed. The money raised by the tax won’t be used to fund green jobs in low-income communities, or to retrain workers currently in high carbon sectors. In other words, this is the epitome of an unjust transition.6 LIKE THIS? GET MORE OF OUR BEST REPORTING AND ANALYSIS In fact, this “neutral” tax might not even break even, with a state government analysis concluding it would blow a $797.2 million hole in Washington’s budget over six fiscal years—this at a time when the legislature is under court orders to fix its failure to adequately fund education. So rather than the equitable green transition that has long been promised (better and more affordable public transit, community controlled renewable energy…), low income communities could well end up with even more eroded services than they have now.7 The backers of I-732 are running on a pessimistic platform of “just do something,” preying on the real urgency that so many of us feel in the face of the climate crisis. But sometimes “something” is worse than nothing, especially if it will stand in the way of better proposals down the road.8 A paltry, revenue-neutral carbon tax simply cannot deliver the massive green energy investments and community-driven solutions we all need. Science-based climate action means an unprecedented, rapid, and decisive shift to renewables; a truly equitable carbon tax can play an important role in spurring the transition, but it won’t work unless we make the polluters pay, and put their immoral profits to work repairing the damage they have knowingly created. The way to do that is to mobilize the broadest possible coalition—led by the front-line communities who stand to benefit most from building a cleaner and fairer economy.9 “Don’t let the perfect be the enemy of the good,” I-732 proponents like to say. It sounds good, but it is not what opponents of this initiative are doing. “Perfect” is not on the table—we lost that option when climate action was delayed for decades. So much time has been lost, in fact, that now we have just one shot to get the policy right. And that means we can’t let the politically difficult be the enemy of the scientifically and socially necessary. 7 Comments Facebook Twitter Email Print Naomi Klein Twitter Naomi Klein is a columnist for The Nation.

It's also supported by numerous environmental groups and one of this nation's leading climate scientists, Dr. James Hansen. It's been endorsed by James Murray (Professor), Founding Director UW Program on Climate Change, University of Washington. It's supported by a coalition of local environmental groups that have been fighting tooth and nail to stop the expansion of coal ports - and largely winning. Is it perfect? No. https://yeson732.org/endorsements-expanded/ (15)(0) Robert Borneman says: November 5, 2016 at 1:15 am Naomi - I love your work, but here I will disagree. This is at least one step in the right direction. It is flawed, yes, but it is a positive vector. (19)(3) Chris Darling says: November 5, 2016 at 2:24 pm Absolutely agree. I am distressed and angry that lots of people who I usually agree with are arguing strenuously against this carbon tax. But none of them have been able to institute any of the "better policies" that they so vigorously support. Start with this carbon tax, then build on it. That is nearly always how reform and positive change begins anyway. (13)(0) Charles Rosengard says: November 5, 2016 at 4:10 pm Micromanaging taxation and spending by initiative is really bad policy...for one thing, initiatives are hard to change once passed. It would have been far better to ask for a tax and then direct the legislature to make it revenue neutral. That would have prevented the current problem of blowing a hole in the state budget. I would urge the backers to try again with this approach. That way you wouldn't have public sector unions campaigning against you. (0)(5) Roger Hoffmann says: November 4, 2016 at 7:32 pm Thanks for this well-considered argument. I'm not in Washington and was unaware of the initiative. This presents arguments that I might well not have heard...and makes me more wary of the "revenue-neutral" carbon tax notion...something that heretofore had seemed to me a reasonable approach.

Behind each table, a friendly face greets those who approach, offering to answer any questions they may have about the organization they represent and the opportunities it can offer. The 20th Force Support Squadron held their annual Job and Education Fair at the Carolina Skies Club and Conference Center here, Oct. 27. “The goal of the event is to connect job and education seekers with different vendors to get information about education opportunities and the job market in the local area,” said Erica Brown, 20th FSS Airman and Family Readiness Center (AFRC) community readiness specialist. “We had a variety of different vendors at the fair this year; everything from Boeing plane manufacturing to the University of South Carolina Sumter.” In all, representatives from 54 higher-learning institutions and businesses in Sumter County were present to answer questions Team Shaw members had about everything from tuition rates to hiring processes. “It was cool to see the different options available locally,” said Morgan Rice, military spouse. “I’ve never been in this part of the country, but my husband was recently stationed here, so it’s nice to know I can pursue my education or get a nice job in town while he’s working on base.” Brown said members of the military community have a unique skillset that employers and universities are generally eager to take advantage of, and hopes speaking to the vendors at the fair gave Team Shaw personnel some insight into the opportunities available outside the gate. “Exposure is important,” said Brown. “Sometimes as members of the military community, we stay in the military bubble and don’t think to look for opportunities in the local community. It’s good for Team Shaw members to be exposed to the different employment and education opportunities in the area.” Though the Job and Education Fair is held only once per year, resources such as the AFRC and the Education Center are available to Team Shaw members year-round. Contact the AFRC at (803) 895-1253 or the Education Center at (803) 895-1838 for more information.

Please send us your startup announcements. Email is best: newchicagobusiness@gmail.com. Crain's contributor Robert Loerzel brings you news of fresh local startups every week. While she was on maternity leave from a job at Procter & Gamble, Chicagoan Allison Robinson decided to create the Mom Project, a website that matches women who want flexible work with project-based opportunities at companies. “It's challenging work with an emphasis on flexibility,” says Robinson, who left her job at P&G to launch the startup. “We're really trying to redefine the workplace for moms. It hasn't been very friendly.” Since the Mom Project launched in April, about 7,000 professionals have signed up for the website's free job-seeking service. “They're highly educated,” Robinson says. “They come from really great professional backgrounds, such as Boeing, Google, McDonald's, etc. They're so happy to stay on their career track but also be at home.” More than 150 companies are participating in the website, paying a fee to the Mom Project when they make a hire. Chicagoan Kimberly Grotto Howard, who owns Grotto Marketing, used the Mom Project to line up a work project with Braeside Condominium Management. She says she likes the tone that the Mom Project sets in conversations between job-seekers and employers. “It's almost like they look at you like a human being rather than a machine—from the beginning,” she says. Hidden down an alley in Evanston, The Barn opened for business Tuesday, Nov. 1, serving what it calls a “meat-centric” menu. The restaurant is inside a 19th-century brick barn at the rear of 1016 Church St. that once housed the stable of delivery horses for Borden Condensed Milk Co. The Barn's proprietor is Amy Morton, daughter of Arnie Morton, who founded Morton's Steakhouses, and the chef is Nicole Pederson. They're the same team that opened Found restaurant in Evanston four years ago. Barrington startup F3 Cycling seeks to raise $45,000 on Kickstarter to manufacture the FormMount Bicycle Computer Mount—an adjustable mount that holds GPS devices of any size above the handlebars of a bicycle. The campaign, which ends Nov. 20, has raised about $28,000 so far for the mount, which was created by Tim Boundy, Frank Pistorio and Mike Scalise. It's available for pledges starting at $43. The Apothecary is a deck of playing cards that change color when touched by hands. It's the creation of Chicagoan Alexander Chin, who runs Seasons Playing Cards and the Shung Shung package design studio. Chin has raised more than $50,000 with a Kickstarter campaign to launch the color-changing playing cards, more than meeting his $20,000 goal.

Bloomberg 11/4/2016 Justin Bachman © Eric Thayer/Getty Images File photo of Delta Airlines planes sit at John F. Kennedy Airport, July 22, 2014, in New York City As space in economy class becomes ever more constrained, airlines have devised a more spacious cabin product for passengers priced out of business class but determined to escape the indignities of steerage. Called “premium economy,” this section of added frills between coach and business aims to address a widening gap that has emerged between those cabins—and to extract more money from passengers. The premium economy cabin has been a staple of large international airlines for several years but is just now beginning to appear on American carriers. Quotes in the article Boeing Co BA ▼ 148.11 -1.88 -1.25% American Airlines Group Inc AAL ▲ 44.76 +1.36 +3.13% B/E Aerospace Inc BEAV ▼ 59.14 -0.03 -0.05% Singapore Airlines Ltd SINGY ▼ 13.57 -0.44 -3.11% Airlines across the globe have rushed to add premium economy cabins in recent years, as customers show a willingness to pay for extra space and amenities. “There’s a demand for something in between economy and business,” American Airlines Group Inc. spokesman Joshua Freed said on Thursday during a tour of the new 787-9 at Dallas-Ft. Worth Airport. The plane is a larger, 285-seat version of the 787-8 American first received early last year. On almost every airline with premium economy, the biggest lure is increased seat pitch and width, typically along with nicer food and tableware, a larger entertainment screen, noise-canceling or reducing headphones, a fancier amenities kit, and occasionally, a more generous baggage allowance. A pre-flight beverage is usually included. Some airlines also let premium economy passengers use their airport lounges for an additional fee. American is the first U.S. airline to introduce the new cabin , on its Boeing 787-9, with 21 seats in a 2-3-2 across layout, far roomier than the 3-3-3 arrangement in the back of the plane. American uses the same 19-inch wide B/E Aerospace Inc.  MiQ seat for first class on some of its domestic aircraft, which further sharpens the contrast with the airline’s regular, 17-inch wide 787 economy seats. The new cabin offers 38 inches of seat pitch, and a six-inch recline. Each seat also comes with an 11-inch screen, two inches larger than what you get in back, and those blessed noise-reducing headphones. (Passengers in the 787-9’s business class get noise-canceling versions and a 15.4-inch screen.) Big money maker In terms of revenue, the cabins are ingenious, given that fares typically are hundreds of dollars more than regular economy, with only marginally higher cost. For example, Singapore Airlines Ltd., is charging more than $3,900 round-trip for premium economy in early December—almost $2000 more than economy on its new nonstop flight from San Francisco to Singapore. Qantas Airways Ltd.’s premium economy fare over the same period is nearly $1,500 above the $2,411 round-trip for flights from Los Angeles to Brisbane, Australia. Singapore, which started its premium economy service this summer, prices the cabin about 40 percent to 50 percent above economy seats, spokesman James Boyd said. The largest sales, so far, have come on the longest routes and have appealed to many customers who are traveling for work, he said. American’s first 787-9 international flight with the new cabin took place on Thursday from Dallas to São Paulo. The 787-9s will also be deployed from American’s Texas hub to Madrid, Paris, and Seoul. American’s new Airbus A350s will come with premium economy as well, and the carrier plans to retrofit almost all of its long-haul international fleet—777s, 787-8s, and Airbus A330s—with premium economy by the end of 2018.  American plans to roll out new fares for the cabin in mid-January. Until then, it is selling them as part of its regular extra-legroom seats. American officials declined to discuss fares for the new cabin. Delta Air Lines Inc. plans to fly its new premium economy product next autumn on new Airbus A350s, followed by Boeing 777s in 2018. Delta said on Thursday that its premium economy seats will be 19 inches wide, with 38 inches of pitch and a seven-inch recline, and will come with a Tumi amenity kit and a Westin in-flight blanket. A spokesman for United Continental Holdings Inc., Jonathan Guerin, said the company has no announcements about premium economy. “We continually evaluate the products and services we offer our customers throughout their journey,” he said. Someone has to pay While premium economy represents a silver lining for travelers hoping to improve economy-class travel, there’s a downside for those who are fine with flying cattle class. For some airlines, the “nicer” coach cabin could represent an incentive to make regular economy even more spartan. If you squeeze a bit more in the back, in other words, maybe a few more people will be induced to spring an additional $300 or $500 to move into premium economy. Another possible consequence of this three-tiered world could involve carry-ons. Some Wall Street analysts have long wondered why numerous airlines that gleefully charge for a first checked bag domestically still have no fee for that same bag on many international routes. Premium economy could become the gateway to further differentiate cabins. Joe Kiely, Delta’s managing director of product and customer experience, said the Atlanta-based airline is not planning “to materially change” the attributes of its economy cabin as the premium version starts to fly. American’s Freed said his airline isn’t considering changes to economy as a result of the new cabin. For travelers, the question really becomes: Is it worth it? Is a six-hour flight too short to pony up for the extra room? What about 10 or 11 hours? And if the economy seat is fine for you, does a slightly larger video screen or a glass of wine before departure matter?  “The value proposition is all about the space on board,” said Seth Miller, a frequent traveler and travel writer , noting that some aspects of premium economy can be purchased à la carte.  “But space is not something so easily acquired once on the plane.” Go to MSN Home More in Money 20 tips for saving money at the grocery store U.S. News & World Report - Money Amazing Airstreams: The coolest tiny homes on wheels Lovemoney 8 ways President Trump will affect Wall Street U.S. News & World Report - Money 6 reasons to think twice before moving to Canada MarketWatch The 10 most expensive prescription drugs in America Fiscal Times How China's richest man is buying up the world Lovemoney AdChoices AdChoices Home News Weather Entertainment Sports Money Lifestyle Health & Fitness Food & Drink Travel Autos Video election 2016 © 2016 Microsoft Privacy Legal About our Ads Feedback Help MSN Worldwide Newsletter

It must do better on technology. Written by Edward Alden Senior fellow, Council on Foreign Relations & Vivek Wadhwa Director of Research, Duke University's Center for Entrepreneurship and Research Commercialization Obsession 2016 November 04, 2016 Employees work at a production line inside a factory of Saic GM Wuling, in China. (Reuters/Norihiko Shirouzu) Share Written by Edward Alden Senior fellow, Council on Foreign Relations & Vivek Wadhwa Director of Research, Duke University's Center for Entrepreneurship and Research Commercialization Obsession 2016 November 04, 2016 Global trade and investment have been great engines of progress for much of the world. Over the past two decades, poorer countries reduced the gap between themselves and their richer counterparts for the first time since the Industrial Revolution, in no small part because of the opportunities opened by global trade. Technology has the same transformative potential in industries as varied as energy, health care, transportation and education. New inventions that are imminent or already here could transform the lives of billions of people for the better. Yet, as we see in the 2016 US election campaign, and as we have seen in Europe and elsewhere, rapid change has a dark side. If too many people are unable to adapt quickly and successfully to these changes, they will push back— blaming trade or immigrants or the elites—and demand a reversion to a simpler time. The task of governments is to help people manage these transformations so that they benefit many and do as little harm as possible. In the United States, governments mostly failed at that task during the era of globalization; if the full benefits of the coming technologies are to be enjoyed, governments will have to do much better this time around. The competitive pressures create by globalization should have been no surprise. About 45 years ago, president Richard Nixon’s top international economic adviser, Pete Peterson, warned him that rising competition from Japan and Germany, with much more on the way, “poses adjustment policy which simply cannot be ignored.” Americans have unquestionably gained by the lower prices and higher quality that import competition enabled. Apple iPhones and the latest Boeing jets are the result of the collective input of tens of thousands of collaborators in dozens of countries around the world. But many lost well-paid manufacturing jobs to import competition or outsourcing, and the US government has made little effort to mitigate those costs, even in worker retraining. President John F. Kennedy promised in 1962 that the government would help American workers who lost out to trade competition as the United States lowered its barriers to imports. “When considerations of national policy make it desirable to avoid higher tariffs, those injured by the competition should not be required to bear the full brunt of the impact,” he said. But today, the United States spends a smaller proportion of its wealth on worker retraining than any of the other 34 member countries of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development except for Mexico and Chile. Too often, the attitude of the US government has been deeply irresponsible, assuming that markets would simply sort everything out for the best. In the long run, everybody may end up with work and income, but in the short run, as Peterson told Nixon, the failure to help Americans adapt to the new reality will “leave long periods when the transition is painful beyond endurance.” With technology change, too, we know well in advance exactly what is coming. Driverless technology, for example, will soon become the standard in the trucking industry. Driverless trucks can run 24 hours a day and won’t demand overtime pay. There are 3.5 million truck drivers in the United States, and an additional 5.5 million jobs in related industries—roughly one in every 15 American workers. They could perhaps go to work for UPS or deliver pizzas, but many of those delivery jobs will be lost to drones. Personal-care robots will increasingly replace home health-care aides, and self-checkout machines are already replacing retail-store clerks; these are jobs that filled some of the gap left by the disappearance of manufacturing jobs to global competition, but they, too, will soon be under siege. Automation is even hitting law and education, two sectors long thought immune to technological substitution. These vulnerabilities necessitate something that too often was absent in the era of globalization: good public policies. Artificial intelligence will transform teaching, for example, but without access to the highest-speed broadband, students in poor and rural areas will fall further behind their urban counterparts. And unless we strengthen social safety nets and retraining schemes, there will be far too many losers in the labor market. There is no way to avoid the huge impact that technology will have on employment; we have to prepare for it and help those whose skills it antiquates. Much more even than globalization, technology is going to create upheaval and destroy industries and jobs. This can be for the better, helping us create new and more interesting jobs or freeing up time for leisure and artistic pursuits. But unless we find ways to share the prosperity and help Americans adapt to the coming changes, many could be left worse off than they are. And, as we have seen this year, that is a recipe for an angry backlash—and political upheaval. A version of this piece originally appeared on the Washington Post. Follow Vivek on Twitter at @wadhwa.

Until then, it is selling them as part of its regular extra-legroom seats. American officials declined to discuss fares for the new cabin. Delta Air Lines Inc. plans to fly its new premium economy product next autumn on new Airbus A350s, followed by Boeing 777s in 2018. Delta said on Thursday that its premium economy seats will be 19 inches wide, with 38 inches of pitch and a seven-inch recline, and will come with a Tumi amenity kit and a Westin in-flight blanket. A spokesman for United Continental Holdings Inc., Jonathan Guerin, said the company has no announcements about premium economy. “We continually evaluate the products and services we offer our customers throughout their journey,” he said. Someone has to pay While premium economy represents a silver lining for travelers hoping to improve economy-class travel, there’s a downside for those who are fine with flying cattle class. For some airlines, the “nicer” coach cabin could represent an incentive to make regular economy even more spartan. If you squeeze a bit more in the back, in other words, maybe a few more people will be induced to spring an additional $300 or $500 to move into premium economy. Another possible consequence of this three-tiered world could involve carry-ons. Some Wall Street analysts have long wondered why numerous airlines that gleefully charge for a first checked bag domestically still have no fee for that same bag on many international routes. Premium economy could become the gateway to further differentiate cabins. Joe Kiely, Delta’s managing director of product and customer experience, said the Atlanta-based airline is not planning “to materially change” the attributes of its economy cabin as the premium version starts to fly. American’s Freed said his airline isn’t considering changes to economy as a result of the new cabin. For travelers, the question really becomes: Is it worth it? Is a six-hour flight too short to pony up for the extra room? What about 10 or 11 hours? And if the economy seat is fine for you, does a slightly larger video screen or a glass of wine before departure matter?  “The value proposition is all about the space on board,” said Seth Miller, a frequent traveler and travel writer, noting that some aspects of premium economy can be purchased à la carte. “But space is not something so easily acquired once on the plane.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

PUNE, INDIA, November 4, 2016 /EINPresswire.com/ — Global Air Cargo Containers Market Studies the global air cargo containers market over the period 2010 to 2021. The report provides detailed insights on the market dynamics to enable informed business decision making and growth strategy formulation based on the opportunities present in the market. The Global Air Cargo Containers Market: Highlights Cargo is an essential part of the airline business today. It contributes roughly 9% of the airline revenues which is more than twice the revenues generated from the first class segment. There are several types of unit load device (ULDs), such as containers, pallets, car racks, and stalls used to load the luggage, freight, and other items in an aircraft. Cargo is carried in the lower deck in a passenger aircraft whereas it is also carried on the main deck in a cargo aircraft. Try Sample Report @ https://www.wiseguyreports.com/sample-request/636806-global-air-cargo-containers-opportunity-2016-2021 Cargo container is the most important unit load device (ULD) type and is compatible with narrow body and wide body aircraft. It is highly suitable to load perishable goods, pharmaceutical items, and live animals on an aircraft to transport from one destination to another. The biggest benefit of an air cargo container is that it allows to bundle a large quantity of cargo into a single unit. This helps to minimize the airlines’ operational cost by saving the ground crew’s time and efforts. The number of cargo containers on an aircraft depends on several factors, such as type of aircraft, type of containers, and combination of unit load device. The global air cargo containers market offers an attractive growth opportunity and is expected to grow at 4.3% CAGR during the forecast period of 2016 to 2021. Growing cargo traffic owning to increasing urbanization and rising disposable income, increasing demand for lightweight containers, and advancement in technology are some of the major drivers of the market. The global air cargo containers are segmented into five categories: LD3, LD6, LD11, M1, and Others. There are several types of containers used on the passenger and cargo aircraft. The selection of container type is highly dependent on the type of aircraft and combination of unit load device (ULDs). LD3 is the most widely preferred container type in both passenger and cargo aircraft and is highly compatible with Boeing and Airbus wide body aircraft, such as B747, B767, B777, B787, DC-10, MD-11, A330, A350XWB, and A380. LD3 can also be alternatively used by replacing other container type. Containers are used in the both lower hold as well as main deck in an aircraft. Passenger aircraft uses mainly lower hold for containers, whereas cargo aircraft uses both main deck and lower hold for containers. Lower deck is expected to remain the largest deck type for global air cargo container market during the forecast period due to their use by both passenger and cargo aircraft. Buy this report @ https://www.wiseguyreports.com/checkout?currency=one_user-USD&report_id=636806 Composite materials based air cargo containers are likely to experience the fastest growth during the forecast period. Increasing demand of lightweight containers for reducing operational cost by increasing fuel efficiency is the major driver of the segment. High durability and increased life of containers are the other major drivers of the segment. Composites based containers are about 20% to 40% lighter than that of aluminum based similar sized containers. Wide body aircraft is expected to remain the largest aircraft type for the global air cargo containers market during the forecast period. High number of containers per aircraft, increasing deliveries of wide body aircraft, and increasing demand of wide body aircraft by cargo airlines are some of the major growth drivers of the segment. Wide body aircraft is expected to experience the fastest growth for the same period. The supply chain of this market comprises of raw material suppliers, panel manufacturers, container manufacturers, distributors, ULD management companies, and airline companies. The key air cargo container manufacturers are Zodiac Aerospace, Cargo Composites, Nordisk Aviation, VRR Aviation, and Satco Inc.

X Emirates high-flyer worries about Dublin Airport’s capacity constraints As airline increases Dublin-Dubai capacity, Enda Corneille says third terminal inevitable Fri, Nov 4, 2016, 06:54 Barry O'Halloran Enda Corneille, country manager for Emirates in Ireland, says Dublin Airport needs “a bit of work” before A380s can land there.         Enda Corneille joined Emirates as the airline’s Irish country manager in August 2014, at a pivotal point in its history in this State – shortly before it increased its flights on the Dublin to Dubai route from once a day to twice a day. The move was well-flagged and made sense for the Gulf carrier, as its business here had grown far quicker than expected. It was a “bit of a baptism of fire”, Corneille recalls. But he need not have worried. Two years later, Emirates is filling 78 per cent of the 22,000 seats a month that its aircraft carry on the route. “We are currently tracking 16 per cent ahead of last year,” he notes. “In fact, as we go into 2017, we are going to increase our capacity further. “The aircraft we are operating have 360 seats. They are Boeing 777s, so we are going to upgrade one of those to a 428-seater. We still see there’s growth in the market.” The increase in capacity will come slightly ahead of next year, as the first 428-seater aircraft will take off from Dublin on December 28th and remain on the route right through 2017. Cargo market Alongside the passengers, Emirates has a strong cargo business. The holds of its aircraft are consistently 90 per cent full – with anything from live animals to pharmaceuticals, food, and even baby formula, which is ultimately destined for China. “The belly of the aircraft is very big, so it gives us the chance to sell actively into the cargo market,” Corneille says. While filling 78 per cent of capacity may seem high, local carriers regularly fill a far greater proportion of their planes. Aer Lingus consistently has load factors well above 80 per cent, while Ryanair’s top 90 per cent. Corneille points out that these airlines generate some profits from ancillary revenues – selling food, drinks or charging for extra bags. ADVERTISEMENT As a consequence, they have to focus on selling more seats. That does not mean that Emirates’ craft are never full. The airline regularly sells over 90 per cent of its seats during peak times. Corneille says its focus is to maintain a balanced business throughout the year. Middle Eastern hub About 80 per cent of its passengers travel – or fly in from – beyond Dubai, connecting at the Middle Eastern hub, now the world’s busiest airport, to and from other destinations on the Emirates network. Australia is one of the obvious ones, particularly given that so many Irish people emigrated there during the recession. That increased demand, as they and their families travelled between the two countries. However, that is only one element of its business. Passengers also travel to airports such as Trivandrum and Cochin in India, Guangzhou in China and Nigeria. “These are big markets for migrant workers living in Ireland, ” he points out. “Then you have people holidaying in the Indian Ocean, the Maldives, Seychelles, Mauritius. “And you have companies doing business in China and Australia, so you’ve got a very wide mix. When you are talking about an operation of that scale, 70 per cent to 80 per cent is where you want to be. “At Christmas time, at Easter, you can sell 97 per cent of your seats – but those are busy times and you would expect that to be the case.” Part of the thinking behind the move to a twice-daily operation was to open up more destinations and carve a bigger slice of the market to and from Ireland. Emirates flights are timed to allow travellers connect to onward flights. For this to work, Corneille explains that it has to be daily. Next month’s further increase in capacity indicates that it is working. And Corneille believes the expansion may not stop there. Natural progression “If you spool forward, the natural progression for us in the Irish market is to bring in the Airbus A380,” he says. “Emirates have 84 A380s and we have 58 coming in the next number of years. If Ireland continues on this growth track, it would be no surprise that we would see it landing in Dublin. To put it in scale, you are talking about 615 seats every flight.” Dublin Airport has “a bit of work to be done” before A380s can land there, he cautions. In that respect, Corneille agrees that its plans for a second runway are good news for both his operation and other airlines, though he sees signs that the airport’s infrastructure is showing the strain of continued growth. Passenger numbers this year are on track to break the 25 million record set in 2015. “I think the growth of activity at Dublin Airport has maybe taken people by surprise,” Corneille says. “What I would say about the pressure there is that I do not believe that the consumer experience is impaired significantly. But if you go forward two or three years, and if the airport keeps growing, it will make it very uncomfortable.” If the crowds seen in the early mornings in terminal two – where Emirates’ aircraft take off and land – were to grow significantly, he argues it would be difficult for check-in and security staff to handle. Consequently, he believes that a third terminal is a natural consequence of a second runway. Growing bottlenecks Corneille is not the only one who has noticed the growing bottlenecks in Dublin Airport. Aer Lingus chief executive Stephen Kavanagh warned of their possible impact on its growing transatlantic business earlier this year. ADVERTISEMENT The airport’s manager, State-company Dublin Airport Authority (DAA), shares Aer Lingus’s view that Dublin is ideally positioned to develop as a transatlantic hub, and has been working on responding to the airline’s concerns. Does Corneille believe that this has brought about a shift in DAA’s priorities away from businesses such as his, which are flying in the opposite direction? The short answer is “no”, but he couches his response with the warning that US air traffic can drop sharply in some circumstances. “It is prone to shocks, far more so than others,” he says. “If I look at our business in Emirates, no one market, in terms of region, delivers more than 30 per cent of our revenue, so we are not dependent on UAE, or Australia or America; it’s fairly even. “I know by experience, sadly, that it does not take much for something to happen for US customers to switch off travelling to Europe. ” Part of the experience to which he refers is working on the turnaround of Aer Lingus – then led by fellow Dubliner Willie Walsh, who is now chief executive of that airline’s parent IAG – when its transatlantic business suffered along, with that of the whole industry, following the 9/11 attacks on the World Trade Center in New York in 2001. Corneille joined Aer Lingus as a clerk straight from school in the 1980s and worked his way up through the organisation, which was wholly State-owned in those days. He spent a part of this time abroad, working in such places as Sweden, the Netherlands and the UK. Between 2010 and 2012, he fulfilled a long-term ambition to do an MBA, focused on aviation, and then did a stint teaching with industry body, the International Air Transport Association (IATA). After two years and yet more travelling, he took up his current job. Currency volatility For the moment at least, Corneille says it appears that the traditional link between growth and air travel is broken. Airlines tended to benefit as countries got richer and suffered in downturns. However, in Europe, that does not appear to be the case: economies are flat-lining but air travel is still growing. Nevertheless, he warns that there are challenges ahead. Currency volatility is one of them. “In our business, a 4 or 5 per cent margin is stellar,” he says. “Last year, Emirates did 8.4 [per cent], Ryanair is in the teens, but so many airlines are below the 4 or 5 per cent. It does not take much to tip them below the line. “The dollar is very strong at the moment. Airlines pay all their big bills in dollars. If you are not a US-originating carrier or you don’t do a lot of business in the US, you have to buy your currency – so just a few percentage points on the currency could wipe out a bottom line.” Dollar exchange rates and oil prices are two sides of the same coin in aviation. Oil began tumbling from above the $100-a-barrel mark shortly after Corneille joined Emirates. Fuel has gone from 35 per cent of its cost, at that time, to 26 per cent now. But most in the industry believe prices will begin to rise again in about a year. Corneille argues that airlines will have to able to make money at around $75 to $80-a-barrel if they are going to survive. “Low fuel risks covering a myriad of sins,” he says. “It’s all about the fundamentals of your business. If you can only be profitable at a fuel price of $47, you are in real trouble when it goes to $50 or $55. If and when it gets to $75, if that was a new normal, I think you are going to see casualties out there.” ADVERTISEMENT Brexit Brexit is one of the culprits for recent currency volatility as the vote weakened both sterling and the euro against the dollar. The UK accounts for about 16 per cent of Emirates’ capacity. Its departure from the EU would also mean that Europe’s biggest airport, Heathrow, would find itself outside the union. “The UK is a market in which we have invested heavily,” he says. “So far, we haven’t seen any major shifts in demand. In the Irish context, one of the interesting achievements we’ve had here has been attracting customers from Northern Ireland to fly on our services from Dublin. “That’s something for which we have worked very hard. Were a hard border to be put in between Northern Ireland and the Republic, that certainly would impact our business. But at the moment it’s anybody’s guess where that’s going to end up.” On the whole, Corneille is optimistic that Brexit will not ultimately dampen consumers’ appetite for air travel. “The people leaving school now have never known a world without low-cost airlines,” he says. “People will still want to travel, airlines will still be needed to fulfil that demand.” Enda Corneille’s CV Name: Enda Corneille Age: 51 Family: married, three children Position: Emirates Air, country manager Ireland Why is he in the news? The airline is planning to boost capacity in Ireland and may ultimately use 600-seat Airbus A380s to serve its Dublin-Dubai route. Career: Joined Aer Lingus after leaving school and worked his way up through the organisation, spending a period abroad and returning to Ireland when the airline faced a crisis in the early years of this century. Did an MBA in 2012 and spent a period teaching with the International Air Transport Association before joining Emirates in 2014. Something you might expect: He was accepted into Trinity College Dublin to do a PhD within aviation, just before he joined Emirates. Something you might not expect: He once played guitar and drums in a rock band in Lapland.       Topics: Enda Cornellie Post Stephen Kavanagh Willie Walsh Aer Lingus Eu International Air Transport Association Boeing DAA Emirates Emirates Air Ryanair Dubai Dublin(IE) Europe Ireland Subscribe.   More from The Irish Times Technology Snapchat has secretly filed for flotation, sources claim Personal Finance The bond rout and Irish pension savers: what you need to be aware of International 1:28 RWC 2023: Ireland ready to stage a tournament ‘like no other’ Ireland The top five spots in Dublin to go for a walk with the kids Sponsored World-first tech restores mains electricity to Aran Islands Newbridge Silverware builds ambitious plan for US market My Jaguar F-Pace: ‘I was completely blown away’ Ten things to consider when buying a new sofa ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT Commenting on The Irish Times has changed.

Comments Computerworld | Nov 3, 2016 10:13 PM PT Like this article? thumbsup 0 thumbsdown RELATED TOPICS Security Cloud Computing Comments Only a few months ago the news broke that Vista Equity Partners had acquired identity management vendor Ping Identity for around $600 million. The private equity buyout is one which, in these IPO-constrained times, has seen increasing interest. With the sale, eyes turned toward Ping to see how it would deliver the growth and quick wins that its new overlords would, no doubt, demand. Ping had already seen good traction -- it claims half of the Fortune 100 as customers and has such marques as Boeing, Cisco, Disney, GE, Kraft Foods, TIAA and Walgreens on its books. But private equity wants more, and so the pressure was on Ping to deliver. We didn't have to wait long with the news that Ping was acquiring UnboundID and integrating the access management vendor's tools into its own platform. Now the fruits of that integration are being harvested with the announcement of new platform capabilities directly resulting from the UnboundID integration. And finding good solutions to the uniquely modern challenges of identity and access management isn't easy. Forrester recently pointed out the tension between two contrary aims, saying, "Security and risk pros often struggle to find the right balance between a seamless customer experience and good security. The unique requirements of customer identity, especially scale, performance, usability and support for seamless multichannel interactions, have necessitated the development of CIAM as its own market segment with competitive offerings distinct from traditional solutions for employee IAM." CIAM (consumer identity access management) is a key recognition of the fact that organizations are becoming more porous and that organizations need to think not only of employees but also of consumers within the broader identity management context. CIAM, the notion of running consumer identity and access management from the cloud, is a key strategy for ensuring these tensions are best balanced. Running from the cloud is a key way to ensure the lightest possible touch, but in a context-appropriate way. Essentially, CIAM enables identity vendors and end-user organizations alike to adopt identity platforms that "learn" over time. "Customer identity and access management has a different set of challenges than the more traditional IAM market, which was built for employee access management," said Andre Durand, CEO and founder, Ping Identity. In terms of functionality, the new Ping platform offers single sign-on, multifactor authentication, social login and adaptive authentication capabilities. Specific product highlights include: Ping Directory & Data Server securely stores and manages customer identities and unified customer profiles that are crucial to driving multichannel engagement and improved customer experience. Designed to store rich profile data, the Ping Directory & Data Server supports structured and unstructured data, modern protocols, includes developer-friendly REST APIs, and dramatically lowers total cost of ownership (TCO) relative to legacy directory server products. Ping Data Sync Server keeps identity and profile data synchronized across diverse data sources, both on-premises and in the cloud, to ensure identity data and customer profiles are up to date in real-time for consistent multichannel engagement. The product is used to migrate identity data off costly legacy directory server products so they can be retired, and also to sync production identity data to testing and staging environments while protecting personally identifiable information (PII) and passwords. Ping Data Governance Server provides customers convenience and enhances loyalty and trust by giving them the freedom to self-manage their profiles, preferences and privacy choices. The Ping Data Governance Server manages and governs access to sensitive customer data for apps, employees and partners with centralized policy controls and secure REST APIs, as well as features for delegated account administration. MyPOV Identity management is going to be an increasingly complex area which spans internal-employee, external-contractor and customer/consumer access alike. This release is a good step in that direction and should provide some more growth for those voracious private equity demands. This article is published as part of the IDG Contributor Network.

Two men, including Denver gang member, charged in Montbello drive-by shooting Colorado governor calls marijuana gray market “a clear and present danger” By Andy Pasztor, Dow Jones Newswires Less than three weeks after Orbital ATK Inc.’s Antares rocket resumed launching supplies to the international space station with some fanfare, NASA wants the booster to temporarily stand down, according to industry officials. Instead of using the redesigned Antares — which bounced back from a catastrophic explosion after liftoff in 2014 — to ship supplies into orbit early next year, these officials said, senior program managers at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration have devised an alternate plan. They want the next flight of Orbital’s unmanned Cygnus cargo capsule to ride on top of an Atlas V, a rocket produced by another company that can lift heavier loads and has a superior reliability record. Related Articles July 16, 2016 SpaceX launching space station docking port for NASA October 25, 2016 Lockheed surges on bullish 2017 sales forecast after IT deal September 8, 2016 Lockheed Martin-built OSIRIS-REx now on its way to distant asteroid The Atlas V, manufactured by a joint venture between Boeing Co. and Lockheed Martin Corp., is the Pentagon’s primary large rocket, boasting a long legacy of excellent performance, dependability and more than 60 successful national-security and other missions in a row. Centennial-based United Launch Alliance, which builds and operates the rocket, also is known for the predictability of its launch schedules — an especially important attribute now for NASA decision makers. The shift, which surprised many aerospace experts and caught even senior Orbital officials flat footed, according to people familiar with the matter, underscores NASA’s desire to have greater assurance that the orbiting laboratory will have adequate supplies and material for experiments in the short term. A NASA announcement could come as quickly as the next few days, these people said. Antares successfully shipped cargo to the space station before its 2014 accident, and is expected to resume unmanned shipments from the Wallops Island launchpad offshore Virginia later in 2017. But for now, NASA effectively decided it wants an added insurance policy for both schedule and mission assurance. The agency is particularly concerned about the tempo of supply flights because Elon Musk’s Space Exploration Technologies Corp., the other commercial cargo supplier, currently has suspended all shipments pending completion of an investigation into the second explosion of the company’s Falcon 9 in roughly a year. With the Falcon 9 temporarily grounded, a replacement Atlas V, slated to blast off from Florida in February or March, could carry nearly 1,000 pounds more into orbit than an Antares. Recently, industry and Pentagon officials have said the next Falcon 9 flight is unlikely before mid-January. SpaceX, as Musk’s closely held company is known, has repeatedly said it intends to resume Falcon 9 operations by the end the year. During Orbital’s discussions with NASA, according to industry officials familiar with the matter, the company acknowledged it would have faced a hard time complying with NASA’s upcoming launch deadlines. Orbital still plans to make two launches from the Wallops Island facility in 2017. NASA’s decision surprised industry experts partly because agency officials recently said they felt comfortable with supply levels on board the space station. In a statement Thursday, a NASA spokeswoman reiterated that Russian and Japanese cargo vehicles are expected to link up with the space station this year, but she didn’t comment on the Atlas V issue. The statement added: “We’re working with all of our partners at this time on range availability, space station traffic and other factors to ensure we continue operation of the station in a safe and effective way.” Tags:  Boeing,  Lockheed Martin,  NASA,  United Launch Alliance Digital & Driveway Delivery - 50% Off blog comments powered by Disqus More in Business Business Q&A: JAKE’s Toy Box, Arvada November 15, 2016, 4:12 pm JAKE’s Toy Store is a toy shop local to Arvada that offers a variety of children’s toys and is the proud home of the largest G-scale train setup in all of Colorado.

There was no danger of mid-air collision of two passenger planes on Thursday evening, a spokesman for the Russian Federal Air Transport Agency (Rosaviatsia) told Tass in comments on media reports that said referring to emergency services that two Boeing passenger planes flew dangerously close to each other over the Russian city of Ivanovo. Russia’s State Air Traffic Management Corporation confirmed this information to Tass, explaining that the incident came because of an unsanctioned descent of a Turkish Pegasus Airlines’s plane in mid-air between Podolsk and Klimovsk (located 55 kilometers south of Moscow and eight kilometers south of Podolsk). "There was no danger of the two planes’ colliding," Sergei Izvolsky said, adding that reports saying this could have led to an accident were not true. An official representative of Russia’s State Air Traffic Management Corporation, Nikolai Ivashov, told Tass that the airborne proximity warning indicator went off on board the passenger airliner of Pegasus Airlines. The incident involved the Pegasus Airlines’ plane flying from Istanbul to Moscow’s Domodedovo airport and a Russian Utair airline’s plane on its way from Moscow’s Vnukovo airport to Chechen capital Grozny. The warning system went off as the Turkish plane began an unsanctioned descent from the altitude of 3,650 meters to 3,350 meters, while an Utair plane was ascending to an altitude of 3,350 meters, Ivashov said. Ivashov said the planes passed each other successfully due to prompt actions of air traffic controllers. There was no danger of mid-air collision, and the incident is looked into, he added. {{item.group_date}} {{item.suffix?", "+item.suffix:""}} Show more Share Top News November 15, 20:51 Putin dismisses Ulyukayev as economy minister November 15, 20:51 November 16, 2:31 Russian Defense Ministry slams US rhetoric on Russia’s actions in Syria November 16, 2:31 November 16, 3:21 UN committee passes anti-Russian resolution on Crimea November 16, 3:21 November 15, 17:32 Investigation into Russian economy minister bribery case underway November 15, 17:32 In other media Реклама Photo 14 March to mark anniversary of legendary 1941 parade begins in Moscow 10 Russia's most remarkable monuments 15 Photos of the week: fire in a giant migrant camp, Trump's flag hug and a 'river of sheep' Infographics Russia's gas pipelines to Europe by 2018 Russia’s state defense order in 2015 Chinese Lunar Exploration Program Russia’s Angara A5 heavy-load space carrier rocket Most read Now Today This week 1 Russian Defense Ministry slams US rhetoric on Russia’s actions in Syria 2 Russian forces launch large-scale operation against terrorists in Syria 3 UN committee passes anti-Russian resolution on Crimea 4 Russia sets sights on world’s top three most popular tourist destination ranking 5 Putin dismisses Ulyukayev as economy minister 6 Russian space company developing spacecraft for drowning world’s sole orbiter 7 Sanctions against Russia to remain, but may be eased - ex-minister 1 Russian forces launch large-scale operation against terrorists in Syria 2 Putin sets task to ensure reliable protection of Russian forces in Syria 3 Putin to start meetings with Defense Ministry, military-industrial enterprises 4 MIG-29 fighter jet crashes into Mediterranean off Syrian coast 5 Russian economy minister detained over alleged $2 mln bribe linked to Bashneft deal 6 Ulyukayev detained on suspicion of receiving $2 mln for clearing Rosneft-Bashneft deal 7 Russian warship wipes out terrorists with Kalibr missiles in Syria 1 Dutch sub tried to approach Russian aircraft carrier in Mediterranean — defense ministry 2 Russian forces launch large-scale operation against terrorists in Syria 3 Trump elected president of the United States — live coverage 4 MIG-29 fighter jet crashes into Mediterranean off Syrian coast 5 Putin congratulates Donald Trump on winning US presidential election 6 Russia-US discord will leave with Obama administration: lawmakers' reaction to Trump's win 7 US election results in animated graphics TOP STORIES US presidential election 2016 Conflict in Syria Russia's defense industry Oil & Gas Industry Space programs Реклама News World Russian Politics & Diplomacy Business & Economy Military & Defense Science & Space Society & Culture Sport Press Review Sections Tags Media Press Releases Infographics About us TASS TODAY AGENCY NEWS TASS HISTORY MANAGEMENT CONTACTS Services TASS-PHOTO TASS-ONLINE TASS Beta-version.

Getty Images Advertisement The ranking Democrat on the Senate Committee on Finance is spearheading an effort to have the U.S. reject a Chinese aluminum entrepreneur’s purchase of Cleveland-based Aleris Corp. on national security grounds. Oregon’s Ron Wyden and 11 other senators signed a letter addressed to the Treasury Department asking for the $2.3 billion acquisition announced in August to be reviewed, according to a copy obtained by Bloomberg. Should the Democrats win control of the Senate, Wyden would likely steer the agenda of the committee, which oversees trade. Liu Zhongtian’s Zhongwang USA LLC plans to buy closely held Aleris for $1.11 billion in cash and $1.22 billion in debt, giving one of Asia’s biggest makers of extruded-aluminum products greater access to American and European technology, as well as buyers that include aerospace manufacturers like Boeing Co. and automakers such as Audi. “Chinese entities, including state owned or state controlled enterprises, may have relationships with China’s military, compounding the risk that U.S. technologies will fall into the wrong hands,” the letter, addressed to Treasury Secretary Jack Lew, said. “Aleris’ R&D and technology are critical to current and long-term U.S. economic and national security interests given Aleris’ use of advanced research and modeling techniques, development of high-strength alloys, and design of light armor material with increased ballistic performance,” they wrote. Other signatories include Chuck Schumer, a Democrat from New York; Al Franken, a Democrat from Minnesota; and Rob Portman, a Republican from Ohio. Popular Now More 'Must Have' Metrics to Drive Continuous Improvement Trump is Right on Trade, But He Doesn’t Know Why The Internet of Things Will Make Manufacturing Smarter Significant Footprint When the deal was announced in August, Aleris Chief Executive Officer Sean Stack said in an interview that the company didn’t anticipate any regulatory hurdles.  “We don’t check any of those boxes in terms of the criteria” for a formal inquiry from Treasury’s foreign investment committee, known as CFIUS, Stack said at the time. China Zhongwang Holdings Ltd. could become the world’s second-largest aluminum rolling company should the Aleris acquisition be approved by regulators, Austin, Texas-based Harbor Intelligence wrote in an Aug. 30 research note. Aleris would give Zhongwang a significant footprint in the North American and European flat-rolled products markets, Jorge Vazquez, the managing director of Harbor, said in the note. Zhongwang declined to comment on any CFIUS investigation, saying only that there will be no change to Aleris’ brand, management or business strategy. Deal Scrutiny Chinese takeovers have drawn attention from Capitol Hill recently, including China National Chemical Corp.’s $43 billion acquisition of Syngenta AG. In September, a group of lawmakers, citing investment in the U.S. by China, urged the Government Accountability Office to review whether CFIUS’s authority should be expanded and whether special consideration should be given to acquisitions from state-controlled Chinese buyers. CFIUS, whose members include officials from the Defense, State and Justice Departments, reviews acquisitions of U.S. businesses by foreign buyers. The panel scrutinizes deals for any risks to U.S. national security and can impose conditions on transactions or recommend the president block them. The aluminum industry has caught the attention of lawmakers in recent months amid rising concerns that overproduction in China will force U.S. smelters to shut more production, limiting domestic supply to manufacturers. Senator Schumer joined a group of lawmakers last month pushing for a World Trade Organization case against alleged Chinese subsidies of its aluminum industry, while the U.S. industry upped its anti-China drumbeat at a hearing by the U.S. International Trade Commission probe in September. The U.S. is one of the the top recipients of Chinese capital, attracting more than $18 billion of foreign direct investment in the first half of 2016, according to Rhodium Group. That’s a threefold increase from the same period last year. Print reprints Favorite EMAIL Tweet Please Log In or Register to post comments.

He was 89. Mr. White was an accomplished actor who performed in films and television commercials. He was a lifetime member of Slidell Little Theatre, directing or acting in more than 50 productions there and at other community theater venues. He was known for his portrayal of Mark Twain. He also depicted the fictional character Father Guido Sarducci at many celebrity roasts. In 2011, Mr. White received the President's Arts Award for Performing Artist of the Year from the St. Tammany Commission on Cultural Affairs. After receiving the award, he told The Times-Picayune he loved playing different roles, and that he had been involved in theater for so long that when he walked in the door at home his wife, Joyce, would sometimes ask, "Who are you this week?" Mr. White also won numerous Slidell Little Theatre Ginny awards for acting, directing, set design and poster design. "Whenever he was associated with anything, it was always done in a professional manner and a lot of fun," said Allen Little, a member of the theater's Board of Directors. "They were well done and always appreciated by the audience, whether he directed it or performed in it." In addition to his work in theater, he was known throughout St. Tammany Parish for his work as editor of the Slidell Sentry-News and as a columnist and contributing writer for The Times-Picayune. He won numerous awards from the Louisiana Press Association. Mr. White was born and raised in Washington D.C. After serving in the Navy during World War II, he moved to Wellington, Kan., and began working in Wichita for the Boeing Co., for which he worked for 22 years. Boeing transferred him to New Orleans in 1963. He was a member of Our Lady of Lourdes Catholic Church and a past member of Slidell Elks Lodge 2321, and he volunteered as a juvenile reserve officer with the Slidell Police Department. He was a member of Le Rostierres and was once honored as the club's "roastee" for that year's charity event. Mr. White is survived by his wife of 66 years, Joyce Davis White; three daughters, Kristin Mayes of Greensboro, N.C., Susan Hart of Carriere, Miss., and Jane Cranford of Slidell; a son, Robert White of Slidell; six grandchildren; seven great-grandchilden; and numerous nieces and nephews. A funeral service will be held Wednesday (Nov. 9) at 11 a.m. at Honaker Funeral Home, 1751 Gause Blvd. West, in Forest Lawn Cemetery in Slidell. Visitation begins at 9 a.m. Burial, with military honors, will be in Southeast Louisiana Veterans Cemetery. follow us Twitter Facebook LInkedIn Google+ Pinterest Tumblr Most Read Active Discussions Today's Front Page Today's front page stories delivered to your inbox each morning at 5:30 a.m. Leave this field blank    optional Check here if you do not want to receive additional email offers and information.

ALSO READ Jet pilots report sick to protest against new duty hours; seniors deny crew shortage Jet Airways plans to restart US flights Jet Airways defers Boeing 787 induction Boeing says India needs 1,850 planes Jet Airways will prepare crew’s duty rosters in consultation with the pilots’ union. This was agreed between the pilots’ union and the airline management on Wednesday, after protests by pilots on Tuesday and Wednesday against the new duty hours. Several pilots called in sick and others refused to accept the revised flight duties (due to colleagues’ sick leaves) causing disruption. A shortage of Boeing 737 commanders added to the chaos as flights were disrupted. Jet Airways, however, denied there was shortage of pilots. In a statement, the company said: “The airline has adequate pilots to manage its operations and follows a structured plan for recruitment, induction, training of new pilots as well as grooming and upgrading internal candidates eligible for Captaincy, based on future projections.” Last month, the airline introduced a new software to optimise duty rosters of pilots on a trial basis. The new system was introduced to improve efficiency and productivity. It takes into account pilots’ duty time restrictions according to regulations and leaves. However, pilots are unhappy with this. “The new system does not take into account human factors. Pilots are being rostered for consecutive late-night or early-morning flights. This may be within rules, but does lead to fatigue. Also, in the new roster, pilots are operating flights from outstation bases for 4-5 days at a stretch,” a senior commander noted. He also stated the crew rostering software was fully compliant not only with DGCA regulations, but also internal company limitations that provide a buffer to the DGCA limits. The union submitted 13 points related to ‘human factors’ while expressing concern regarding the new rostering software. The next roster will be prepared taking into account the recommendations of pilots, sources said. For some months, the airline has been facing a shortage of pilots. “While there is a published duty roster for the month, certain flights are open and pilots are asked to do them at short notice,” a pilot complained. According to a PTI report, Jet Airways requires at least 200 more pilots to carry out its operations in a seamless manner. The airline currently has around 1,200 pilots to operate its fleet of 102 aircraft comprising Boeing 777s, B737s, Airbus A330s and ATRs. Almost two-thirds of its fleet consists of B737s. However, a management source said the airline has 350 pilots under various levels of training and has no shortage.

The New York Times reports factory jobs robots A worker loads spools of thread at the Repreve Bottle Processing Center, part of the Unifi textile company in Yadkinville, N.C., Friday, Oct. 21, 2016. The United States is manufacturing more products than ever; it just needs fewer people to make them. One academic study finds that technology is responsible for nearly 90 percent of America's manufacturing job losses. Technology is actually starting to bring factory jobs back to the U.S. as labor costs become less important. (AP Photo/Chuck Burton) Print Email Jennifer Larino, NOLA.com | The Times-Picayune By Jennifer Larino, NOLA.com | The Times-Picayune The Times-Picayune Email the author | Follow on Twitter on November 03, 2016 at 1:39 PM comments The decline in American manufacturing and what to do about it has been a central talking point throughout the presidential election. The likelihood the U.S. will again attract major factories that employ the masses is slim, but small, urban manufacturers could be the key to closing the U.S. class divide, The New York Times reports. The report profiles Marlin Steel, a small Baltimore factory that makes metal baskets for larger manufacturers such as Ford Motor and Boeing. The story features employee James Branch, a high school dropout and ex-convict who turned his life around after completing a two-year metalwork course and landing a job at the factory as a skilled machine operator. The report notes small plants like Marlin Steel are now the norm in American manufacturing, with the vast majority of the nation's 252,000 manufacturing companies employing fewer than 20 people. Blue-collar whites in the Rust Belt and elsewhere in America have been hard hit by factory closures, anger over which has boiled over during the current presidential election. But the report notes the urban African-American working class was "devastated first" when manufacturers moving plants out of "high-cost, union-dominated" cities to locales in the South and West. Experts see small urban manufacturers as one of the few remaining doorways to opportunity for less educated workers, particularly in big cities where finance, technology and other service sectors have dominated job growth, the report says.

Maybe they can, maybe they can’t.  That’s not the point. Russia is now caught up in a disastrous cycle and has to increase their capabilities in Syria every time NATO, the US, or anybody else has a capability in the neighborhood.   Keeping up with the Jones’ has taken on a whole new meaning for Russia. Bottom line, Russia is dropping a ton of money into Syria they can’t earn back, there is no ROI.  Russia is, like the Soviets, spending themselves into oblivion. </end editorial> Last week, NATO announced that it had begun tracking the movement of Russian military aircraft operating in Syria using AWACS reconnaissance planes operating from Turkish bases. But as luck would have it, Russia has just received all the tools it needs to neutralize the alliance’s snooping. In late September, NATO announced that a fleet of 16 Airborne Early Warning and Control Systems (AWACS) aircraft would be sent to Turkey, ostensibly to help the alliance’s ongoing efforts against the Daesh (ISIS/ISIL) terrorists. A month later, the alliance confirmed that the aircraft had been deployed, and that they started their surveillance of Syrian airspace beginning October 20. NATO stressed that the planes are being flown only over international airspace or over Turkey, and will not enter Syrian airspace. Nevertheless, their presence will give them the theoretical capability to monitor aircraft flying over much of Syria. The systems aboard the 16 Boeing E-3 Sentry aircraft allow them to detect targets flying at low altitudes from distances of up to 400 km, and from distances between 450 and 650 km for planes flying at medium and high altitudes. In other words, hypothetically speaking, they can easily detect aircraft operating in Syria without ever crossing the border. The E-3s were deployed to Turkey at Ankara’s request, and following a formal decision at the NATO summit in Warsaw in July. The aircraft have been placed at an air base in the central Turkish province of Konya. Moscow obviously hasn’t been fooled by alliance claims that the planes were deployed to fight the terrorists. Experts have previously pointed out Daesh has no air force, adding that AWACS aircraft in the area are obviously directed against the Syrian Air Force and the Russian air group operating in Syria. In fact, despite the formal talk of an ‘anti-Daesh’ deployment, RAF Air Commander Paddy Teakle came out and openly admitted that the planes will be used to spy on Russian and Syrian jets. “I will not deny that the AWACS will monitor the Russian air forces in Syria, and the air forces of Bashar al-Assad, from Turkish territory; given their range, the radars can monitor territory in Syria and Iraq. But this is not our only goal,” Teakle said. The Il-22PP. Note the ‘pockets’ sticking out of the fuselage, containing electronic warfare equipment As luck would have it, the Russian Ministry of Defense has already worked out a response – installing electronic warfare equipment to the tried and tested Ilyushin Il-22 platform. The new Il-22PP ‘Porubshchik’ (roughly ‘Lumberjack’) electronic warfare and reconnaissance system passed state testing in September. One Il-22PP aircraft was handed over to the air force, with two more expected to be delivered later this month. According to the system’s designers, the plane’s onboard electronics are specifically designed to counter modern AWACS systems, ground-based air defense (such as the MIM-104 Patriot missile system) and manned and unmanned aircraft. Underside view of the Il-22PP The Il-22PP features frequency selectivity, meaning that it will not jam friendly radio electronic systems. Its carrier, a modernized, four-engine Il-22, has a range of up to 6,500 km at altitudes of 8,800 meters and a speed of up to 685 km/h. In addition to jamming capabilities, the planes are capable of conducting electronic intelligence operations of their own, and of protecting friendly aircraft from enemy electronic warfare. The new Il-22PPs will soon be complemented by the Tu-214R, a completely new design, equipped with cutting-edge optical, electronic and radar systems. In August, the Defense Ministry confirmed that a Tu-214R had undergone testing in Syria. That aircraft is itself intended to replace the Ilyushin Il-20M electronic intelligence (ELINT) aircraft, but is capable of multitasking. The Tu-214R’s capabilities include ELINT, signals intelligence (SIGINT) and communications intelligence (COMINT). The plane’s antennae are capable of intercepting signals emitted by everything from aircraft to combat vehicles and mobile phones, and can build an electronic order of battle (EOB). The Tu-214R has been undergoing extensive state testing all this year. © PHOTO: WIKIPEDIA/RIMMA SADYKOVA Russia’s State-of-the-art Tu-214R Spy Plane Successfully Passes Syria Test In other words, just as NATO decided to deploy over a dozen AWACS planes in Turkey to keep an eye on Syria, Russia rolled out several new aircraft allowing Moscow to jam NATO intelligence gathering operations at the flick of a switch. And that’s not even counting the jamming capabilities of ground-based systems already deployed. Whether Russia decides to use this equipment selectively or on a mass scale remains to be seen, but one thing is certain: NATO officials probably won’t be the ones to admit that their surveillance operation in Syria isn’t gathering as much useful info as they hoped they would get.

Home Industry Companies Air India Engineering Services eyes Rs 200 crore revenues next fiscal Air India Engineering Services eyes Rs 200 crore revenues next fiscal Pinning hopes on getting more work orders from private airlines and increased capacity, Air India Engineering Services Ltd (AIESL) expects to rake in Rs 200 crore revenues in the next financial year. By: PTI | Nagpur | Published: November 3, 2016 7:43 PM Speaking to reporters at AIESL’s Nagpur MRO facility, he said there is additional capacity here which the firm wants to utilise for aircraft maintenance work of private airlines. (Source: PTI) Pinning hopes on getting more work orders from private airlines and increased capacity, Air India Engineering Services Ltd (AIESL) expects to rake in Rs 200 crore revenues in the next financial year.A wholly-owned subsidiary of national carrier Air India, AIESL is working aggressively to expand its foot print in the high-growth potential Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul (MRO) segment as most of the private airlines carry out these works overseas. “We are looking to mop up revenue to the tune of Rs 200 crore from third party business in the next fiscal,” Air India Chairman and Managing Director Ashwani Lohani said here.Currently, revenues are around Rs 130 crore and a jump would also help Air India — which has turned operationally profitable after a decade — improve its overall financials. Speaking to reporters at AIESL’s Nagpur MRO facility, he said there is additional capacity here which the firm wants to utilise for aircraft maintenance work of private airlines.The Nagpur facility today started carrying out up to 4A checks on A320 aircraft, manufactured by Airbus. “So far we were doing mainteanance work on B777 only. After getting the mandatory approvals from the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), we have now started carrying out up to 4A checks on A32O aircraft as well,” Lohani said. So far, Air India and aircraft maker Boeing have invested around USD 116 million in the Nagpur facility, which started functioning in August last year. So far, Boeing has put in USD 107 million, while the national carrier has pumped in USD 9 million.At current exchange rate, USD 116 million translates to more than Rs 770 crore. Recently, AIESL inked a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with no-frills carrier SpiceJet for maintaining the latter’s Boeing 737 fleet. According to Lohani, AIESL is negotiating with GoAir to maintain its A32O fleet at the facility here.”AIESL expects to start testing and minor maintenance work of GE engines by January next year,” he noted, adding that such works would be done at an exclusive workshop which is being set up for these engines at the facility. Currently, AIESL provides line maintenance support to around 30 domestic and overseas airlines at various stations. Last month, AIESL joined hands with Tribhuvan Technologies for a strategic partnership to tap opportunities in the defence MRO segment. As there are not many MRO facilities in India, the segment provides significant growth opportunities. While Air India does all these work within the country, most airlines carry them out overseas, at a much higher cost.For the first in a decade, Air India has reported an operating profit of Rs 105 crore in 2015-16 on the back of lower fuel costs and higher passenger numbers. It had an operating loss of Rs 2,636 crore in 2014-15. Please Wait while comments are loading...

clock menu more-arrow Log In or Sign Up Log In Sign Up Topics Trending 2016 Election more Topics Culture Policy & Politics World Business & Finance Technology Science & Health Identities Energy & Environment Explainers Video First Person Podcasts The Big Idea New Money Trending 2016 Election ✕ The audacious plan to bring back supersonic flight — and change air travel forever Updated by Brad Plumer@bradplumer Nov 5, 2016, 4:10pm EDT tweet share (Javier Zarracina/Vox) One of the odd aspects of modern air travel is that it’s not really getting any faster. Ever since British Airways retired its money-losing supersonic Concorde in 2003, airlines have generally stuck to top speeds of around 615 miles per hour. That’ll get you from New York to San Francisco in five or six hours, depending on the winds, but you can’t find a plane that will get you there significantly sooner. We’ve largely learned to tolerate our slow, boring aircraft. But there’s a compelling case that we shouldn’t — that air travel should actually be much, much quicker. Right now there are a host of energetic startups and NASA engineers working on sleek new supersonic jets that could fly twice as fast as today’s commercial planes, if not faster. These jets would be major upgrades on the noisy, fuel-squandering Concordes of old, and they could be ready within the decade. When you talk to people working on these super-fast planes, it’s hard not to get swept up in the excitement. Take Blake Scholl, the CEO of Boom, a startup that’s working with Virgin Galactic to put a new supersonic business jet into service by the early 2020s. He envisions a day when anyone could cross the Pacific or Atlantic in just a few short hours. “It changes how you think about the world,” he tells me. “In aerospace, there are two great passions,” Scholl says. “You either want to build rockets and go colonize Mars — or you want to go really, really fast. People like Elon Musk are focused on the former. We’ve built a team that’s obsessed with the latter.” So what’s the holdup? For some, it’s mostly politics. In a new paper for the Mercatus Center, titled “Make America Boom Again,” policy analysts Eli Dourado and Samuel Hammond make the case that outdated regulations are hindering innovation in air travel. Since 1973, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has banned civilian aircraft from flying faster than sound over land, to avoid the house-rattling sonic booms that the Concorde use to make. Yet recent technological advances have enabled supersonic designs that don’t create loud booms. So why not replace the FAA’s blanket ban with a simple noise standard, and let supersonic travel flourish? Yet there are also skeptics who argue that regulations aren’t the only thing holding back our supersonic future. In practice, faster air travel isn’t always worth it, and airlines have excellent reasons for preferring those slow, boring planes — from fuel efficiency to airport noise to concerns about climate change. “I wish them all the best!” says longtime aviation consultant Robert W. Mann Jr. of the push for supersonic flight. “But it’s still not clear that there will be a market for this.” That is to say, there are two tricky questions to explore here: Can we actually bring back supersonic flight? And even if we can — should we? The Concorde, revisited: Why early attempts at supersonic flight failed Anyone who wants to build a supersonic plane today first has to grapple with the tragic failure of the Concorde jet, a joint venture between Britain and France that began carrying passengers in 1976. The Concorde was a technical marvel, flying at at Mach 2 (twice the speed of sound, or 1,512 mph) to go from New York to London in just 3.5 hours, instead of the usual seven or eight. But it suffered its share of economic woes, and British Airways finally retired the jet in 2003: The Concorde’s demise is a complicated tale, but it suffered from two mortal flaws. First, it was a horrendous fuel-guzzler and expensive to operate. Under the laws of physics, the air resistance or drag that a given object faces in flight increases rapidly as you approach Mach 1. So a plane flying supersonic requires a lot more energy than one flying below the speed of sound. The Concorde’s designers tried to reduce drag by giving their plane a sleek body and short, slender delta wings. Even so, the Concorde required staggering amounts of fuel, burning roughly eight times as much oil per passenger mile for a trans-Atlantic trip as a modern-day 777. That made tickets forbiddingly expensive: $10,000 or more for a New York–London round trip. As oil prices rose, British Airways and Air France (which operated the jets) struggled to consistently fill the jets’ 100-125 seats. Bad for profits. A second problem, meanwhile, is that whenever the Concorde traveled faster than the speed of sound — about 767 miles per hour — it created noisy sonic booms in its wake. To put it simply, the air in front of the Concorde couldn’t get out of its way fast enough, so it bunched up into large shock waves in a cone trailing the plane. Wherever those shock waves reached the ground below, they’d be heard as a loud “BANG, BANG” that could rattle windows, shake structures, and startle people. A sonic boom is a cone-shaped shock wave produced by supersonic aircraft, heard the entire length of its flight path. Image from the US Air Force pamphlet “The Sonic Boom” (n.d.), modified by David Suisman. (Suisman, 2015) Opposition quickly mounted, and in 1973 the FAA banned civilian aircraft from traveling at supersonic speeds over the United States. The Concorde could only exceed Mach 1 over water, limiting its market. British Airways and Air France mainly flew the Concorde out of New York and Washington DC to London and Paris, though there were a number of other international routes over the years.* After the Concorde went bust, airlines shied away from supersonic flight. The extra speed didn’t seem to justify the hassle. At least, until recently. How new technology could make supersonic flight viable again Over the past decade, a number of aerospace engineers and entrepreneurs have been revisiting the Concorde’s demise. And some of them have walked away thinking that supersonic flight could work today — with just a few important (if difficult) tweaks. A few years ago, Blake Scholl, a former coder and longtime amateur pilot, was messing around with spreadsheet models and realized that a number of recent advances in aerodynamics and engine technology could, in theory, allow engineers to build a plane that was far more fuel-efficient than the Concorde. “If you could do that, you could have a plane that was competitive with existing business travel,” he says. “I started running these numbers by various experts and realized it wasn’t just science fiction.” In 2014, Scholl founded Boom, an aviation company based in Denver, Colorado. He has since assembled a team that includes accomplished former NASA, Boeing, and Lockheed Martin engineers to design a working successor to the Concorde. Artist’s conception of what Boom’s new supersonic plane might look like. (Boom) They’re not alone. Back in 2002, a group of investors led by Robert Bass formed a company called Aerion that aimed to harness innovative new drag-reducing technology to create a much more efficient supersonic business jet. Aerion is pretty far along in this task: In 2014, the company announced a partnership with aerospace giant Airbus to build and certify a supersonic craft within the decade. (Gulfstream, an established jet manufacturer, is also working with NASA on its own designs for supersonic flight.) The race is on. So what makes these companies think they can do better than the Concorde’s designers and build a vastly more fuel-efficient plane? In interviews, Boom and Aerion pointed to three broad technical advances that make this all seem feasible: First, modern-day computer modeling makes exploring new aircraft designs far easier than it was in the 1960s. If the Concorde’s designers wanted to test a new shape to see how it affected drag, they had to build a scale model and put it through large wind tunnels — a clumsy process that could take months. Nowadays, genetic algorithms can explore and tweak new shapes much more quickly and effectively. Newer composite materials, like carbon fiber, allow aircraft designers to pursue shapes and contours that weren’t possible for the Concorde’s designers, who worked with aluminum. (These materials can also better deal with the serious heat that builds up on the leading edge of the plane’s wing at speeds above Mach 2.) Today’s jet engines are far more efficient than they were in the Concorde’s heyday. “The breakthrough will be in the sum of those parts, not any one invention,” Scholl says. Put those three factors together, and he thinks Boom can build a plane that goes at top speeds of Mach 2.2 while being 30 percent more fuel-efficient than the Concorde. It will still create sonic booms, though quieter than the Concorde’s. The proof, of course, will be in the testing. Boom plans to publicly unveil its design for a supersonic plane in the near future. The company will then team up with Virgin Galactic to build and test a prototype at Edwards Air Base in California by the end of 2017. The hope, Scholl says, is to have a working plane in service by “the early 2020s.” Aerion, meanwhile, is pursuing a different design that harnesses supersonic natural laminar flow, a concept it developed (and tested with NASA) to reduce the turbulent airflow around wings and reduce drag. Aerion will work with Airbus on the engineering and is in the process of selecting suppliers to manufacture the engines. The plan, says spokesperson Jeff Miller, is to get the plane into service by 2021: (Aerion) Assuming these planes work, the next challenge will be finding a market. Scholl’s goal is to introduce a plane that will cost just $5,000 to fly round-trip between, say, New York and London. At that price, his market research suggests, there will be enough business travelers willing to pay a premium for speed that he can fill small 45-seat jets. (As part of their deal, Virgin has an option to buy 10 of Boom’s planes.) Consider the advantages: A flight between San Francisco and Tokyo might take just four hours instead of 11. A flight between New York and London, three instead of eight. “You could leave early in the morning from New York, have afternoon meetings in London, and be back home in time for dinner,” Scholl notes. Still, it’s far from clear that Boom and Aerion can succeed in luring enough passengers to turn a profit. For one, notes Mann, the aviation consultant, their planes will still be less fuel-efficient than conventional planes, which means they could be more vulnerable to sharp swings in oil prices. Plus, there are market risks. The most profitable Concorde route lay between the great financial centers of New York and London. But what happens if, say, Brexit ends up shrinking the size of London’s banking industry? “Obviously we’ll have to see,” says Mann. “But those are just examples of the sort of external shocks that could impinge on the practicality of supersonic travel.” Boom and Aerion remain optimistic. The broader hope is that if supersonic flight gains a foothold with business travelers, costs will eventually come down as technology improves. Scholl’s ultimate goal is to make supersonic flight affordable to everyone. “It’s the same thing that Tesla did,” he says. “They started with the luxury Roadster and are now focused on mass-market cars.” Because Boom and Aerion’s planes would only fly supersonic over water at the start, they could coexist with the FAA’s current ban on overland travel (although both companies could face regulatory hurdles around the noise their planes will make on takeoff and landing; more on that below). That said, oceanic flights are still a relatively limited market. For supersonic travel to truly conquer the entire world, someone would have to take the next step and develop a plane that doesn’t produce terrifying sonic booms over land. And that’s where NASA comes in. The next big challenge: silencing sonic booms to allow overland flights Ever since the 1970s, NASA has been wrestling with the math around the pressure waves that create aircraft sonic booms, trying to figure out how to reduce them. And, over the past decade, its engineers think they’ve finally cracked the problem. “We’re at the point where we think we can design a quiet supersonic airplane,” says Peter Coen, the commercial supersonic technology project manager at NASA’s Langley Research Center. His team is currently working with Lockheed Martin on a $20 million project to design a prototype X-plane with much, much softer booms. The science of what Coen’s team is doing gets a bit complicated (see this report for the gritty details), but here’s a very basic explanation. When a plane like the Concorde travels at supersonic speed, it creates a bunch of invisible shock waves, sharp pressure disturbances emanating from all the objects that stick out of the plane — the nose, the windshield, the wings, the tail. They’re shaped like this: Although shock waves aren’t usually visible to the naked eye, NASA used schlieren imagery to see the disturbances made by a USAF Test Pilot School T-38C aircraft flying at supersonic speeds over the Mojave Desert. (NASA) These shock waves are all different strengths, and they as they travel through the air, they coalesce into just two powerful waves — a strong positive pressure wave at the nose and a strong negative pressure wave at the tail. This “N-wave” configuration is highly stable and doesn’t decay much as it travels toward the ground. When this wave hits people below, our ears register it as two noisy bangs from each of the two sharp swings in pressure. “So the trick,” Coen says, “is to keep those shock waves from coalescing into a N-shaped signal.” In theory, a plane with a different shape would create shock waves of more uniform strength that coalesce more gradually as they move through the air. If done successfully, people on the ground would experience a gentle rise in pressure when the wave hits rather than two sharp pressure changes. Recent experiments have been promising. The Concorde created booms that were perceived to be as loud as 135 decibels on the ground — about as loud as the sound a jet engine makes from 100 feet away. But by experimenting with different shapes, NASA has developed aircraft models that, in wind-tunnel tests, create booms as soft as 79 perceived decibels, roughly comparable to a car passing 10 feet away. Eventually, NASA would like to get that down that to 70 decibels. The goal is to design an actual plane using these concepts. Here is an artist’s conception of what the new X-plane might look like. Artist’s conception of a low boom flight demonstration quiet supersonic transport (QueSST) X-plane design. (NASA/Lockheed Martin) NASA will then plan to build a one-third-scale prototype and conduct the first test flight in 2020.* The idea is that they’ll gather data on what sorts of sonic booms the planes actually make, and then the FAA can use that data in deciding whether it makes sense to replace the blanket ban on overland supersonic travel with a noise standard — saying, for example, that supersonic flight is acceptable overland so long as the booms are below a certain threshold. (If that actually happened, Gulfstream says planes with quiet booms might be a possibility by 2025 or 2030 or so.) But changing those rules will require wading into the murky world of politics — which is never easy. The US government could still put the kibosh on supersonic flight In theory, the FAA is open to the idea of revising its blanket ban on supersonic flight over land. In 2011, an FAA official gave a public presentation explaining that research on silencing sonic booms has progressed far enough that it may be time to consider a noise standard. But the FAA is moving very slowly on revamping the rules — in part because it’s focused on other challenges, like overhauling the nation’s air traffic control system. The agency is also waiting for NASA and other companies to demonstrate their quiet-boom technology before crafting fresh regulations. In their paper for the Mercatus Center, Dourado and Hammond argue that the FAA’s current approach is precisely backward. It would be much better for the agency to set guidelines ahead of time on what type of overland sonic booms would be acceptable — so that companies can have some certainty and know what to aim for in developing new designs. “Right now, the FAA is saying we’ll accept supersonic when we hear what’s acceptable,” says Hammond. “We’re trying to point out the absurdity in that.” Even if the boom issue gets sorted out, however, there’s still another hurdle for supersonic planes: takeoff and landing. While all supersonic planes would fly at less-than-supersonic (or “subsonic”) speeds around airports, they’d still make a fair bit of noise on takeoff and landing. And that’s where things get a little tricky. Over the years, the FAA has developed strict standards for the noise that airplanes can make around airports. Aircraft manufacturers have responded to these rules, in part, by doing things like building high-bypass engines with large-diameter fans that propel air out of the engine more slowly and hence reduce the noise from the exhaust. The trade-off with these high-bypass engines is that they’re not as fuel-efficient at takeoff and the large fans create more drag while the plane’s in the air. That’s not a huge deal for normal aircraft, but it could be ruinous for supersonic jets. If the FAA requires supersonic jets to adhere to the newest, strictest noise standards coming into effect by 2018 (known as Stage 5 standards), those jets will take a major fuel efficiency hit. By contrast, if the FAA merely asked supersonic aircraft to adhere to the standards that were in place back in 2006 (known as Stage 3 standards), Scholl estimates, that would reduce supersonic ticket costs by some 15 percent. Dourado and Hammond argue that the FAA should allow looser airport noise standards for supersonic jets in the very beginning, at least, to allow the technology to get to market. Engineers can then work on making them quieter. The companies making the supersonic planes agree. “The physics of supersonic aircraft are just so different, so saying you need to meet the standards of subsonic regulations could put a damper on development,” says Aerion’s Miller. “We’re hoping to reach a compromise with the FAA on this, since we’re talking about a new industry that could be beneficial.” This could prove a contentious subject, however. The politics around airport noise can be extremely dicey (in separate research, Dourado and Raymond Russell have found that most airport noise complaints to the FAA come from just a small handful of people). While a strict airport noise rule wouldn’t necessarily kill supersonic flight, it could increase prices and dampen the market, particularly in the early days. The deeper question: Do we really want supersonic flight? Good old Concorde. Photo by Ian Waldie/Getty Images The noise issue raises a bigger philosophical question around supersonic flight: How much do we really value speed, anyway? After all, the structure of our current aviation industry is the result of a series of compromises around competing values. And over the past 30 years, airlines have shown that there are a lot of other things we value more than simply going really, really fast. Back in the 1970s, Mann explains, the industry realized that if it wanted to keep growing, it needed to be a good neighbor. That meant replacing their existing fleet of loud and dirty airplanes with much quieter models — even if it meant some trade-offs in terms of performance. Similarly, ever since the oil shocks of that decade, the industry has made a point of valuing fuel efficiency over raw speed. “The optimal cruise speed has basically declined over the years,” Mann says. “Above about Mach 0.8, you pay so much for that speed in terms of fuel.” Today, a flight from New York to Denver or from DC to Miami actually takes longer than it did in the 1970s — because airlines have realized that the fuel savings are worth the delay. Going forward, there’s another important value to weigh on the scale: climate change. Aviation is already the fastest-growing source of greenhouse gas emissions in the world, and the world’s airlines just agreed to a sweeping deal under the International Civil Aviation Organization to offset the growth of their emissions starting in 2020. Conventional aircraft manufacturers have worked hard to reduce fuel burn by 45 percent since 1968, and companies like Boeing and Airbus are now pushing to cut fuel use even further, through the use of lighter materials and novel engine designs. Still, this remains one of the toughest sectors to decarbonize. And new supersonic jets that burn fuel at higher rates than conventional planes seem to go in precisely the opposite direction — even if they do save travelers time. True, a few supersonic business jets flying around wouldn’t have a major impact on emissions. But if cheap supersonic flight became ubiquitous, the global warming impact could be staggering (particularly if the planes fly at higher altitudes, due to the contrail effect). With the world already struggling to avoid dangerously large temperature increases, a new fuel-inefficient plane seems like a luxury the planet can ill afford. When I asked NASA’s Coen about the climate consequences of a world filled with supersonic jets, he agreed that it was a real concern. But he also pointed out that there might be ways to square these different values. Future caps on aviation emissions could, for instance, spur supersonic jets to adopt low-carbon biofuels. (Or there’s another way this could all go: As Mann pointed out, it’s possible that stricter carbon caps could simply make supersonic flight unviable.) It’s still too early to say how these issues will play out, but it’s a good reminder that our slow, boring planes have quite a few things going for them. Even so, at the end of the day, the prospect of faster flight will remain forever tantalizing. The reduction in travel times has been one of the great technological breakthroughs of the past 200 years. This isn’t merely convenient; in some ways, it’s been the very marker of progress. Humans have long been obsessed with breaking new barriers, with going faster and faster. Even if on a purely romantic level, it would be a shame if we’re currently stuck going about as fast as we’ll ever go. —— * Correction: I originally wrote that NASA and Lockheed Martin are working together to build a prototype of a quiet supersonic plane. That’s not quite accurate. Lockheed Martin has a contract to design a plane. But NASA hasn’t yet selected a company to actually build the prototype. Further reading: My colleague Phil Edwards took a more in-depth (video) look at the demise of the Concorde. Here’s a more detailed look at how airlines and manufacturers are trying to push down fuel use and emissions to address growing concerns over global warming.

Self-driving vehicles could disrupt the economy by replacing human drivers in the future. (Reuters) Global trade and investment have been great engines of progress for much of the world.  Over the past two decades, poorer countries reduced the gap between themselves and their richer counterparts for the first time since the Industrial Revolution, in no small part because of the opportunities opened by global trade. Technology has the same transformative potential in industries as varied as energy, health care, transportation and education. New inventions that are imminent or already here could transform the lives of billions of people for the better. Yet, as we see in the 2016 U.S. election campaign, and as we have seen in Europe and elsewhere, rapid change has a dark side. If too many people are unable to adapt quickly and successfully to these changes, they will push back – blaming trade or immigrants or the elites – and demand a reversion to a simpler time. The task of governments is to help people manage these transformations so that they benefit many and do as little harm as possible.  In the United States, governments mostly failed at that task during the era of globalization; if the full benefits of the coming technologies are to be enjoyed, governments will have to do much better this time around. The competitive pressures create by globalization should have been no surprise.  About 45 years ago, President Richard Nixon’s top international economic adviser, Pete Peterson, warned him that rising competition from Japan and Germany, with much more on the way, “poses adjustment policy which simply cannot be ignored.” Americans have unquestionably gained by the lower prices and higher quality that import competition enabled.  Apple iPhones and the latest Boeing jets are the result of the collective input of tens of thousands of collaborators in dozens of countries around the world.  But many lost well-paid manufacturing jobs to import competition or outsourcing, and the U.S. government has made little effort to mitigate those costs, even in worker retraining. [‘What Trump represents isn’t crazy and it’s not going away.’ Peter Thiel defends support for Donald Trump.] President John F. Kennedy promised in 1962 that the government would help American workers who lost out to trade competition as the United States lowered its barriers to imports.  “When considerations of national policy make it desirable to avoid higher tariffs, those injured by the competition should not be required to bear the full brunt of the impact,” he said.  But today, the United States spends a smaller proportion of its wealth on worker retraining than any of the other 34 member countries of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development except for Mexico and Chile. Too often, the attitude of the U.S. government has been deeply irresponsible, assuming that markets would simply sort everything out for the best.  In the long run, everybody may end up with work and income, but in the short run, as Peterson told Nixon, the failure to help Americans adapt to the new reality will “leave long periods when the transition is painful beyond endurance.” With technology change, too, we know well in advance exactly what is coming.  Driverless technology, for example, will soon become the standard in the trucking industry.  Driverless trucks can run 24 hours a day and won’t demand overtime pay.  There are 3.5 million truck drivers in the United States, and an additional 5.5 million jobs in related industries – roughly one in every 15 American workers.  They could perhaps go to work for UPS or deliver pizzas, but many of those delivery jobs will be lost to drones. Personal-care robots will increasingly replace home health-care aides, and self-checkout machines are already replacing retail-store clerks; these are jobs that filled some of the gap left by the disappearance of manufacturing jobs to global competition, but they, too, will soon be under siege.  Automation is even hitting law and education, two sectors long thought immune to technological substitution. [Google and Facebook contribute zero economic value. That’s a big problem for trade.] These vulnerabilities necessitate something that too often was absent in the era of globalization: good public policies.  Artificial intelligence will transform teaching, for example, but without access to the highest-speed broadband, students in poor and rural areas will fall further behind their urban counterparts.  And unless we strengthen social safety nets and retraining schemes, there will be far too many losers in the labor market.  There is no way to avoid the huge impact that technology will have on employment; we have to prepare for it and help those whose skills it antiquates. Much more even than globalization, technology is going to create upheaval and destroy industries and jobs.  This can be for the better, helping us create new and more interesting jobs or freeing up time for leisure and artistic pursuits.  But unless we find ways to share the prosperity and help Americans adapt to the coming changes, many could be left worse off than they are.  And, as we have seen this year, that is a recipe for an angry backlash—and political upheaval.

Read the Sun full report: “They reveal a pervy airman in stockings taking lurid selfies of his aroused manhood. One image shows a leg sprawled over the dashboard while the plane appears to be on autopilot and with the co-pilot’s seat empty.

A further sordid snap shows the man with his genitals exposed in a cabin’s toilet. Other images show a p*rnographic magazine spread on the controls and explicit playing cards scattered around the cockpit. Serial numbers on the control panel suggest the pictures were taken aboard at least two separate British Airways planes. The airline confirmed yesterday it was probing the images — and whether they were taken feet from passengers mid-flight. BA said: “We are taking these allegations extremely seriously.” Twice-married dad Glover — a BA Captain since 1990 — is thought to have denied to bosses the pictures are of him. But he is likely to be permanently grounded if they disagree. A senior airline source said investigators would examine whether the images could have been shot in a flight simulator. One of the serial numbers visible — GYMMB — is used on BA’s simulators. But it is also registered to a twin-engine Boeing. The other — GVIIL — is also one of the 777 fleet used by BA. Airline expert Chris Yates said yesterday: “This is very dangerous if the plane is in mid-flight. “If you are flying, you can fly into serious turbulence.” An Established Or Up And Coming Artist Or Actor/Actress?

November 16, 2016 1242 GMT Home Iran Africa Asia Europe International U.S. Middle East Culture Business Health Sport Society Video News ID:171489 Publish Date: Thu, 03 Nov 2016 13:24:17 GMT Service: Iran China, Russia to invest up to $20bn in long-haul jet: report China and Russia have agreed on a joint venture to build a long-haul wide-bodied jet, competing with Boeing and Airbus which wield total control over the jumbo jet industry. Beijing and Moscow will invest "up to $20 billion" to jointly make a jumbo jet, media reports said on Thursday. “Each side will contribute half,” Russia's United Aircraft Corporation (UAC) president Yury Slyusar said, quoted by China's Global Times newspaper. Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC) and UAC agreed to build the plane in June when Russian President Vladimir Putin met his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping in Beijing. COMAC and UAC executives presented a mock-up of the jet for the first time in public at a ceremony during Airshow China in Zhuhai, Guangzhou Province on Wednesday. COMAC said the joint venture, to be set up in Shanghai this year, aims to build a 280-seat wide-body jet with a range of 12,000 kilometers to be on a par with Boeing's 787 and the Airbus A350. According to the companies' websites, the price of a 290-seat Boeing 787 is $264.6 million and a 280-seat Airbus A350 is $272.4 million. Slyusar said their plane will be approximately 10 percent cheaper than those of the rivals. "COMAC has outstanding technology and designs and we will not only cooperate in technology but also in intellectual property." COMAC said their plane will make its first flight in seven years and customer delivery will begin three years later. Building commercial aircraft requires advanced technology. COMAC developed its single-aisle jet, the C919, last year and said it had received 570 orders from 23 customers.  The firm's regional jet, the 90-seat ARJ21, flew its first commercial flight in June. Russia, however, is more advanced in this field and UAC enjoys the Sukhoi Superjet 100 in its report card. "A wide-body jet is an extremely complicated product, which will require a lot of skills (to develop) and require broad industrial knowledge," Guo told reporters. "China and Russia each have their own advantages." Beijing is looking to build up its domestic aerospace industry, with the sector among those highlighted in its "Made in China 2025" plan. China is expected to become the world's largest aviation market, with its travelers taking to the skies in ever-growing numbers. Airbus estimates China will need nearly 6,000 new planes worth $945 billion in the next two decades, with Boeing's forecast even more optimistic at more than $1 trillion.     KeyWords China Russia long-haul jet   Comments Comment Name: Email: Comment: Security Key: Latest News Iran confiscates 2 tonnes of explosives from Daesh terrorists Iran, China must boost cooperation in fight on terrorism: Rouhani Syria holds pacesetter Iran in wetland Everton joins race for Iran’s Azmoun Iran defeated by Kazakhstan in Asian water polo championship Iran, absent from kabaddi World Cup final Iranian teams capture Asian youth, junior weightlifting titles French MP: Iran’s role in fight against terrorism crucial Iran: Killing of Muslims in Nigeria worrisome Rouhani: Iran, China must boost anti-terror fight Most Visited Obama vows to veto bill seeking to block Iran plane sales Trump not going to ‘hurt’ Clinton Trump looking at 'quick ways' to ditch Paris climate accord: Report www.irandailyonline.com All rights reserved by iran Daily Online Copyright Page Generated in 0/0692 sec

Photograph: Alamy Rajeev Syal Thursday 3 November 2016 06.09 EDT Last modified on Thursday 3 November 2016 08.28 EDT Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger A £285m airport built on a remote South Atlantic island with UK government cash will require “an open chequebook” if it is to ever welcome commercial airlines as planned, a select committee hearing has been told. Plans to build a clifftop runway on St Helena were approved in 2010 by then ministers Andrew Mitchell and William Hague, making it the single largest investment made in an overseas territory. But its inauguration ceremony for commercial flights was suspended indefinitely in May after tests showed that planes could be blown off course. St Helena airport costing £285m of UK money is delayed over safety concerns Read more On Wednesday, civil servants from the Department for International Development (DfID) were unable to tell the public accounts committee why they had not tested for wind shear – a sudden powerful change in wind direction that can destabilise large aircraft – before the airport was built. Meg Hillier, the chair of the committee, said more public money would have to be spent if the airport was to ever function for the island’s 4,000 inhabitants. One of the more drastic options that has been considered and rejected by officials was to blow the top off two mountains adjoining the airfield, the committee was told. The more likely option to make the airport useable would be to allow smaller planes to fly to the island instead of the planned Boeing 737s. Hillier said civil servants had already spent money allocated to them to make the airport useable. “Given that there is a UK commitment to the Saints [inhabitants of St Helena] and they are UK citizens, given that it is your responsibility and DfID’s to make that happen, and given that there is an airport there, it does seem that there is frankly an open chequebook because you have spent all that good money and you aren’t going to get anything for it,” she said. Mark Lowcock, DfID’s permanent secretary, told the committee repeatedly that he would prefer not to say who might be to blame for failing to discover the strong winds at the airport because of an ongoing internal review. He said officials were in talks with carriers about launching flights, but it would involve much smaller planes than previously envisaged. Stephen Phillips, a Conservative committee member, pointed out to Lowcock that in the 19th century the anthropologist Charles Darwin in his travel journal The Voyage of the Beagle referred to the wind shear on St Helena. “Darwin wrote this: ‘The only inconveniences I experienced on my walks [on St Helena] were from the impetuous winds. One day I noticed a curious circumstance: standing on the edge of a plain, terminated by a great cliff of about a thousand feet in depth, I saw at the distance of a few yards right to windward, some tern, struggling against a very strong breeze, whilst, where I stood, the air was quite calm.’ “If Charles Darwin, as he does in this passage, gives a very good example of wind shear in St Helena in 1836, how have we got a position where DfID commissioned a £285.5m airport, paid for by the British taxpayer, without appreciating the danger of wind shear?” Lowcock replied: “That is a very good question, and one I will attempt to answer in my review.” Phillips also raised the possible option, mentioned in previous media reports, of blowing up the tops of two mountains. “I have the greatest respect for the civil service but I did not realise that it could move mountains,” he said. Lowcock replied: “It is not my plan currently to spend a lot of money exploring that option. My plan is to put in place a safe air service.” Caroline Flint, the former Labour minister, asked Lowcock if he was aware that the businessman and former Conservative donor Lord Ashcroft had argued in favour of the airport weeks before it was approved by ministers. Lowcock replied that he had not been approached by Ashcroft. Ministers are resisting offering any compensation to those who made investments on the basis that up to 30,000 tourists would fly to visit the remote island. At present, it takes a five-day trip by ship to reach St Helena from southern Africa. One airline, Atlantic Star, on Wednesday urged the government to discuss a rapid introduction of “a much-needed air service” in and out of St Helena. Its proposal would involve using a specialist Avro RJ100 jet, with the airline able to begin flights next spring. The airline ran a test flight to St Helena on 21 October. The island, which is about 1,200 miles west of Angola, was where Napoleon was exiled in 1815 after his defeat at Waterloo. He died there in 1821.

Executives of the state-owned Comac have unveiled plans to make a twin-aisle jet that can fly as far as 12,000 kilometres – about the distance between Beijing and New York. The company is forming a joint venture with Russia’s United Aircraft to research on and manufacture the aircraft. The announcement at a biennial airshow in southern Zhuhai city marks the first time China has given details of the widebody aircraft since the planned Russian partnership was flagged two years ago and comes amid delays to the maiden flight of the C919. The new plane would be able to seat 280 people, posing a direct challenge to jetliners from Boeing and Airbus such as their current B777, B787, A330 and A350 models. Comac is targeting the maiden flight of the new aircraft to take place about seven years from now, and the first delivery three years after that. An assembly line will be set up in Shanghai, with an eye to exporting the plane to other markets in the future, said Guo Bozhi, an assistant president at Comac who is in charge of the widebody-jet project. "Developing an aircraft is an arduous journey and we have to overcome a lot of technical difficulties," Mr Guo said. But the timeframe "is a definite target", he said. He declined to provide financial figures on the joint venture and development of the twin-engine plane. Comac said this week that China Eastern Airlines will be the first carrier to take delivery of the locally made C919, a day after Wu Guanghui, Comac’s chief designer, said the narrowbody jet’s test flight would take place later this year or in early 2017. The plane’s maiden flight has been pushed back at least twice since 2014. * Bloomberg business@thenational.ae Follow The National’s Business section on Twitter Pages: Add your comment View all comments Related Next-gen A380s and Boeing 777s on the way as Emirates boosts superjumbo-only fleet China Eastern set to order new C919 jets from domestic plane maker Comac Mitsubishi’s jet set for push into Middle East First made-in-China jetliner makes debut commercial flight More Aviation Next-gen A380s and Boeing 777s on the way as Emirates boosts superjumbo-only fleet Delivery of 61 Boeing jetliners on hold as United looks to save $1.6bn UK’s easyJet reports first annual profit slide in six years Malaysia Airlines pins hopes on adding flights to China MOST VIEWED Business | All Next-gen A380s and Boeing 777s on the way as Emirates boosts superjumbo-only fleet Stronger dollar could hold back Dubai property recovery Leonardo DiCaprio and synthetics irritate the diamond industry Majid Al Futtaim will expand Sharjah City Centre Review: Moto Z is a brilliant modular device Rolls-Royce chief: ‘Our targets are always based on profitability, not volumes’ Review: Joyable app helps ease social anxiety at work Etihad Airways on the lookout for new pilots in Europe A380s and Boeing 777s make up Emirates’ entire fleet as it scores a world’s first More Most Viewed Album review: Hardwired...

This week, a group of US senators led by Ron Wyden (D-Oregon), ranking member of the US Senate committee of finance overseeing trade, urged US Treasury Secretary Jack Lew to review and reject Zhongwang’s takeover plan on national security grounds, Bloomberg reported, citing a letter signed by Wyden and his 11 colleagues. “Chinese entities, including state-owned or state-controlled enterprises, may have relationships with China’s military, compounding the risk that U.S. technologies will fall into the wrong hands,” said the letter. Aleris’ high-strength alloys manufacturing technology enabled by advanced modelling techniques, and its design of light armour material with enhanced ballistic performance are critical to long term US economic and national security interests, the letter said. The opposition is not based on facts, said Amanda Xu, spokeswoman of Zhongwang USA. “Contrary to what was stated in the senators’ letter, Zhongwang USA and the Zhongwang group of companies are neither state-owned nor state-controlled,” Xu told the South China Morning Post in a phone interview. “Zhongwang is a fully market driven company without any affiliation to any government.” Aleris, which supplies rolled aluminium sheets to Boeing, Airbus and German carmaker Audi, said it doesn’t make products that have any defence applications. “Our facilities in the US produce aluminium [products] for car and truck exteriors, gutters and roofing material,” the Ohio-based company said in a statement. “Less than 1 per cent of our sales go into defence applications, and none of those goods are produced in the US. “The technology to produce aluminium plate, which is used in some military applications, is standard production technology widely used in the aluminium industry,” Aleris said. Zhongwang, based in Liaoning province, has not supplied any flat rolled aluminium sheets to China’s military, since its US$4.7 billion Tianjin plant will only be able to enter commercial production next year, spokeswoman Xu said. The company’s chairman Liu Zhongtian also owns Zhongwang USA. The company is eyeing Aleris’ technology and production capacity to produce aluminium sheets that can used in the automotive industry, as well as supply the aircraft manufacturing industry. China is the world’s largest vehicle market, and is projected to be the fastest growing major market for new aircraft. In Tianjin, Toyota has a plant that makes Vios compact cars, while Airbus assembles its A320 single-aisle aircraft in the city. Andrew Driscoll, head of resources research at CLSA, said he is not aware of cases where aluminium products caused security concern arising from sales to the military, since it is used in a wide range of industries. Zhongwang isn’t the first Chinese acquirer to face opposition by US politicians. This comes as China overtook the US in outbound mergers and acquisitions during the first nine months of 2016, according to data by Dealogic. China overtakes US as world’s largest assets acquirer “Much of this has to do with prejudice, unjustified worries, protectionism and politicking,” said Kevin Guo, a Shenzhen-based analyst at Guotai Junan Securities, who has a “Buy” recommendation on the company’s Hong Kong-traded stock. Aleris, which was founded in 2004 through a merger of Commonwealth Industries Inc and IMCO Recycling Inc., operates 40 production facilities around the world, making extruded aluminium products, recycling aluminium and high specification aluminium products. It filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2009 and was taken over in 2010 by a group of private equity funds including Apollo Management, Oaktree Capital Management and Sankaty Advisors. “The change in shareholding from a private equity based ownership to a long-term industry investor will bring in additional resources and capital to Aleris and help create new jobs,” Zhongwang’s spokeswoman Xu said. After the proposed takeover, Aleris will continue to operate as an independent company under the same management in the forseeable future, and any plan to transfer technology to China Zhongwang will only be a consideration for the long term, she said. Zhongwang USA has submitted a filing to the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) on an “entirely voluntarily” basis, to address any regulatory concerns about the takeover, she added.

PHOTO | FILE  In Summary KQ says the losses arise from leasing out aircraft at rentals lower than that charged by the primary lessors. Advertisement By VICTOR JUMA Kenya Airways is set to incur an additional Sh3 billion accounting loss from new aircraft sub-leasing contracts, representing the deficit between what it is earning on the deals and its payments to the primary lessors. The national carrier disclosed the new onerous leases in its financial statements for the half-year ended September. These follow the leasing of five Boeing airplanes to Oman Air and Turkish Airlines last year in a deal that left the Nairobi Securities Exchange-listed firm with a Sh4 billion accounting loss in the year ended March. KQ, as the airline is known by its international code, says the losses arise from leasing out aircraft at rentals lower than that charged by the primary lessors. The leases are part of the company’s efforts to cut costs at a time when slow revenue growth and mounting liabilities have kept it in the loss territory. The additional sub-leasing of aircraft involves the same carriers, with Oman Air taking two B787-8s and Turkish Airlines taking three B777-300ERs. This brings the total number of aircraft seconded to the Muscat-based carrier to four while those sent to the Istanbul-based airline rises to six. The Sh3 billion loss on the new contracts is split into long-term leases that will generate a Sh2.07 billion deficit and short-term leases whose loss stands at Sh980 million. Part of the losses has been realised, with others to filter through over the coming years as the contracts roll on over the medium term. The loss-making contracts represent the heavy cost to shareholders of unwinding Project Mawingu. READ: KQ half-year loss shrinks to Sh4.8bn on deep cost cuts KQ signed the deals to mitigate even larger losses it would have otherwise incurred from cancelling the contracts at a time when it could not fly the planes profitably itself. The airline has said the contracts would reduce the airline’s fleet costs by an equivalent of Sh8.4 billion annually, indicating that sub-leasing at a loss is a lesser evil compared with maintaining a bloated fleet. Sub-leasing the aircraft, non-renewal of other leases and sale of several airplanes saw KQ’s fleet drop to 47 units in the year ended March, compared with 52 units the year before. The airline plans to further scale back its capacity in the current financial year to cut costs. The company says it is keen on reducing the number of empty seats on long-haul flights, with the capacity reduction also being accompanied by termination of some routes and a decrease in the frequency of flights on others. email print In the headlines Auditor stands by Sh5bn Afya House dossier Official tells Senate team he is a patriotic Kenyan who is never cowed by threats.

F-35B jets undergo testing on U.S. Navy amphibious assault ship by Geoff Ziezulewicz Washington (UPI) Nov 1, 2016 Lockheed receives $536 million F-22 contract modification Washington (UPI) Nov 1, 2016 - Lockheed Martin Aeronautics Co. has been awarded a $536 million U.S. Air Force contract modification for work on the F-22 Raptor jet. The deal will cover sustainment services for the aircraft. Work will be performed in Texas and has an estimated completion date of December 2017. The Air Force Life Cycle Management Center is the contracting entity. The Raptor is the service's newest fighter and performs air-to-air and air-to-ground missions while providing a combination of stealth, super-cruise, maneuverability and integrated avionics. In its air-to-air configuration, the Raptor carries six AIM-120 missiles and two AIM-9 Sidewinder missiles. When equipped for air-to-ground operations, it can carry two 1,000-pound GBU-32 joint direct attack munitions, as well as two AIM-120s and two AIM-9s. Seven F-35B Lightning II jets are scheduled to conduct developmental and operational testing aboard the USS America amphibious assault ship, the sea service said Monday. Two jets are slated for third-phase developmental testing, while five will undergo operational testing, the Navy said in a statement. That third phase will evaluate the jet's short take-off vertical landing operations in a high-sea state, shipboard landings and night operations. Operational testing will involve the simulation of extensive maintenance on a ship. America is the first ship of its class that incorporates design elements specifically to accommodate the fifth-generation jet. Among its enhanced aviation capabilities, the ship includes an enlarged hangar deck, realigned and expanded aviation maintenance facilities, increased stowage and more fuel capacity. It can accommodate the Lightning II, U.S. Marine Corps Ospreys and various helicopters. Boeing gets $80 million option for Apache helicopter work Washington (UPI) Nov 1, 2016 - Boeing has received an $80 million U.S. Army contract modification to execute a year two option for work on Apache helicopters. The deal will cover the continuation of Apache Helicopter performance-based logistics for D-unique, D/E common and E-unique components, supplies and services. Work will be performed in Arizona and has an estimated completion date of October 2017. The Army Contracting Command is the contracting entity. The Apache is an advanced multirole combat helicopter manufactured by Boeing. Boeing has delivered more than 2,200 of the helicopters to global customers. The first of the helicopters was delivered to the U.S. Army in 1984, with international customers now including Egypt, Greece, Indonesia, Israel, Japan, Korea, Kuwait, The Netherlands, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, the United Arab Emirates and the United Kingdom.

Cobham to develop V-22 aerial refueling kit by Geoff Ziezulewicz Washington (UPI) Oct 28, 2016 disclaimer: image is for illustration purposes only Cobham has been awarded a contract by the Bell-Boeing Joint Project Office to develop an aerial refueling system for the U.S. Marine Corps' Osprey aircraft, Cobham announced this week. The deal, for an undisclosed amount, involves developing a palletized aerial refueling system that will allow the V-22 to refuel other aircraft using Cobham's modified FR300 Hose Drum Unit, the company said in a statement. The roll-on/roll-off kit will allow Marines to refuel F-35B Lightning II and F/A-18 Hornet jets. Design of the V-22 Aerial Refueling System, also known as VARS, will be done at Cobham's Iowa facility, with delivery slated to begin in 2018 after completion of the system's testing and analysis.

Oregon's Ron Wyden and 11 other senators signed a letter addressed to the Treasury Department asking for the $2.3 billion acquisition announced in August to be reviewed and rejected on national security grounds, according to a copy obtained by Bloomberg. Wyden spokesman Keith Chu confirmed the letter's authenticity. Should the Democrats win back control of the Senate, Wyden would likely steer the subcommittee's agenda. Liu's Zhongwang USA plans to buy closely held Aleris for $1.11 billion in cash and $1.22 billion in debt, giving one of Asia's biggest makers of extruded-aluminum products greater access to American and European technology, as well as buyers that include aerospace manufacturers like Boeing and automakers such as Audi. "Chinese entities, including state-owned or state-controlled enterprises, may have relationships with China's military, compounding the risk that U.S. technologies will fall into the wrong hands," the letter, addressed to Treasury Secretary Jack Lew, said. "Aleris' R&D and technology are critical to current and long-term U.S. economic and national security interests given Aleris' use of advanced research and modeling techniques, development of high-strength alloys, and design of light armor material with increased ballistic performance," they wrote. Other signatories include Chuck Schumer, a Democrat from New York, and Rob Portman, a Republican from Ohio. When the deal was announced in August, Aleris Chief Executive Officer Sean Stack said in an interview that the company didn't anticipate any regulatory hurdles. "We don't check any of those boxes in terms of the criteria" for a formal inquiry from Treasury's foreign investment committee known as CFIUS, Stack said at the time. China Zhongwang Holdings could become the world's second-largest aluminum rolling company should the Aleris acquisition be approved by regulators, Austin, Texas-based Harbor Intelligence wrote in an Aug. 30 research note. Aleris would give Zhongwang a significant footprint in the North American and European flat-rolled products markets, Jorge Vazquez, the managing director of Harbor, said in the note. Zhongwang declined to comment on any CFIUS investigation, saying only that there will be no change to Aleris' brand, management or business strategy. Chinese takeovers have drawn attention from Capitol Hill recently, including China National Chemical Corp.'s $43 billion acquisition of Syngenta AG. In September, a group of lawmakers, citing investment in the U.S. by China, urged the Government Accountability Office to review whether CFIUS's authority should be expanded and whether special consideration should be given to acquisitions from state-controlled Chinese buyers. CFIUS, whose members include officials from the Defense, State and Justice Departments, reviews acquisitions of U.S. businesses by foreign buyers. The panel scrutinizes deals for any risks to U.S. national security and can impose conditions on transactions or recommend the president block them. The aluminum industry has caught the attention of lawmakers in recent months amid rising concerns that overproduction in China will force U.S. smelters to shut more production, limiting domestic supply to manufacturers. Schumer joined a group of lawmakers last month pushing for a World Trade Organization case against alleged Chinese subsidies of its aluminum industry, while the U.S. industry upped its anti-China drumbeat at a hearing by the U.S. International Trade Commission probe in September. The U.S. is one of the the top recipients of Chinese capital, attracting more than $18 billion of foreign direct investment in the first half of 2016, according to Rhodium Group. That's a threefold increase from the same period last year. × Post a comment Emoticons [smile] [beam] [wink] [sad] [cool] [innocent] [rolleyes] [whistling] [lol] [huh] [tongue] [love] [sleeping] [yawn] [unsure] [angry] [blink] [crying] [ohmy] [scared] [sleep] [sneaky] [tongue_smile] [thumbdown] [thumbup] [censored] [happybirthday] [ban] [spam] [offtopic] [batman] [ninja] [pirate] [alien] Comment Text Cancel Post comment × Report Cancel Report Abuse × Watch this discussion.

Jet Airways Boeing 737 aircraft pilots to use iPads Boeing says India needs 1,850 planes Jet Airways defers Boeing 787 induction Jet Airways to operate Boeing 777 on Mumbai-Singapore route Naresh Goyal-owned Jet Airways is facing acute shortage of pilots amid the airline increasing its capacity in the fast growing domestic market, according to sources. A number of Jet Airways flights have got delayed in the recent past as the airline has failed to provide pilots due to paucity of the flight crew, they said. The Mumbai-headquartered full service carrier is second largest airline in terms of number of domestic operations after no-frills IndiGo. As part of the winter schedule, which is effective from late last month, Jet Airways plans to operate 3,010 flights per week while its subsidiary JetLite 507 flights per week. "Jet Airways is facing shortage of pilots for quite some time now. While the airline has been increasing the number of flights in its both winter and summer schedules each year, the number of pilots is not increasing in the same ratio, leading to shortage of flight crew," a source said. Jet Airways requires at least 200 more pilots to carry out its operations in a seamless manner, the source said, adding "shortage is more in narrow body, Boeing 737 fleet." The airline currently has around 1,200 pilots to operate its fleet of 117 aircraft comprising Boeing 777s, B737s, Airbus A330s and ATRs. Almost two-thirds of its fleet consists of B737s. Response to queries sent to Jet Airways in this regard was awaited. Significantly, as many as 18 per cent of Jet Airways flights from four metro airports -- Delhi, Mumbai, Hyderabad and Bengaluru -- failed to either arrive or depart on time in September. A major chunk of its flights are from its two hubs - Mumbai and New Delhi. Bollywood star Abhishek Bachchan had hit out at the airline after his flight to Chennai from Mumbai last week was allegedly delayed due to non-availability of flight crew. "Flying to Chennai. Baggage, check. Board flight on time, check. Seat belt fastened, check. Only thing we need now are our pilots!!...Well done Jet Airways!!! Entire plane boarded without any pilots on board. Still waiting and hoping...," he had said in a series of tweets over the nearly none-and-half- hour delay of his flight. For the last almost two years, India has been the fastest growing air traffic market in the world. In September, the domestic air passenger traffic registered a robust growth of about 23 per cent as compared the same period last year.

REUTERS/Bobby Yip/File PhotoMore By David Lawder WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Twelve U.S. senators urged on Wednesday that a national security review panel reject Chinese aluminum giant Zhongwang International Group Ltd's proposed $2.3 billion purchase of U.S. aluminum products maker Aleris Corp. The senators asked Treasury Secretary Jack Lew in a letter to launch a review of the deal by the Committee on Foreign Investments in the United States and "ultimately reject it" on grounds that it would damage the U.S. defense industrial base. "Zhongwang’s purchase of Aleris would directly undermine our national security, including by jeopardizing the U.S. manufacturing base for sensitive technologies in an industry already devastated by the effects of China’s market distorting policies, and creating serious risk that sensitive technologies and knowhow will be transferred to China, further imperiling U.S. defense interests," the senators wrote. The deal, announced just over two months ago, would give one of the world's largest makers of extruded aluminum products access to U.S. technology and customers, which include Boeing Co and U.S. and European automakers that are increasingly turning to aluminum. It comes as another Zhongwang subsidiary is embroiled in a dispute over U.S. import duties amid broader trade tensions between the U.S. aluminum industry and China. The U.S. Commerce Department is currently investigating China Zhongwang Holdings Ltd over allegations that it has been evading U.S. import duties on extruded products by shipping them through third countries. The letter to Lew was signed by Republican Rob Portman of Ohio, where Aleris is based, and Democrats Ron Wyden, Charles Schumer, Bob Casey, Joe Manchin, Kirsten Gillibrand, Joe Donnelly, Debbie Stabenow, Jeff Merkley, Amy Klobuchar, Tammy Baldwin and Al Franken. They said the review committee needed to be cautious about the potential for sensitive research data to be transferred to China, including data with military applications such as advanced modeling techniques, high-strength alloys and the design of light armor material. "Despite the national security importance of our nation’s aluminum sector, the industry continues to be decimated by China’s market distorting policies that contribute to vast overcapacity," the senators wrote. "China’s overcapacity in aluminum has directly contributed to severe reductions in U.S. domestic production as smelters unable to compete have been forced to close. Each such closure further imperils our nation’s ability to ensure a reliable supply of strategic materials in times of crisis," they wrote. A Treasury spokeswoman declined to comment on the letter, adding that information filed with CFIUS by law cannot be disclosed to the public and that Treasury does not comment on specific CFIUS cases. Aleris said in a statement reacting to the letter that the company's U.S. facilities produce no defense-related products, and the technology for aluminum plate used in some defense products was widely used in the industry. "Our facilities in the U.S. produce aluminum for car and truck exteriors, gutters and roofing material," Aleris said. " Less than one percent of our sales go into defense applications, and none of those goods are produced in the U.S." A Zhongwang spokeswoman said in a statement that the CFIUS filing for the transaction is voluntary and that the company and its U.S. subsidiary have no connection with the Chinese government. She added that the transaction will bring in additional resources and capital to Aleris and there will be no changes to management, employees or business strategies.

Login Learn more about Thomson Reuters Foundation Home Women's Rights Climate Trafficking Property Rights Humanitarian Food Search Twelve U.S. senators urge security rejection of China aluminum deal by Reuters Thursday, 3 November 2016 01:16 GMT Share: Newsletter sign up: Most Popular INTERVIEW-U.S. will be 'rogue' state if it ditches climate accord - UN envoy First U.S. transgender soldiers make gender transition after policy shift Stateless limbo ends as 3,000 'legal ghosts' in the Philippines get nationality Thorny issue of who will pay for climate damage simmers at UN talks As climate change uproots communities, innovation can rescue culture By David Lawder WASHINGTON, Nov 2 (Reuters) - Twelve U.S. senators on Wednesday urged that a national security review panel reject Chinese aluminum giant Zhongwang International Group Ltd's proposed $2.3 billion purchase of U.S. aluminum products maker Aleris Corp. The senators asked Treasury Secretary Jack Lew in a letter to launch a review of the deal by the Committee on Foreign Investments in the United States and "ultimately reject it" on grounds that it would damage the U.S. defense industrial base. "Zhongwang's purchase of Aleris would directly undermine our national security, including by jeopardizing the U.S. manufacturing base for sensitive technologies in an industry already devastated by the effects of China's market distorting policies, and creating serious risk that sensitive technologies and knowhow will be transferred to China, further imperiling U.S. defense interests," the senators wrote. The deal, announced just over two months ago, would give one of the world's largest makers of extruded aluminum products access to U.S. technology and customers that include Boeing Co and other U.S. defense contractors and automakers that are increasingly turning to aluminum. It comes as another Zhongwang subsidiary is embroiled in a dispute over U.S. import duties amid broader trade tensions between the U.S. aluminum industry and China. The U.S. Commerce Department is currently investigating China Zhongwang Holdings Ltd over allegations that it has been evading U.S. import duties on extruded products by shipping them through third countries. The letter to Lew was signed by Republican Rob Portman of Ohio, where Aleris is based, and Democrats Ron Wyden, Charles Schumer, Bob Casey, Joe Manchin, Kirsten Gillibrand, Joe Donnelly, Debbie Stabenow, Jeff Merkley, Amy Klobuchar, Tammy Baldwin and Al Franken. They said the review committee needed to be cautious about the potential for sensitive research data to be transferred to China, including data with military applications such as advanced modeling techniques, high-strength alloys and the design of light armor material. "Despite the national security importance of our nation's aluminum sector, the industry continues to be decimated by China's market distorting policies that contribute to vast overcapacity," the senators wrote. "China's overcapacity in aluminum has directly contributed to severe reductions in U.S. domestic production as smelters unable to compete have been forced to close. Each such closure further imperils our nation's ability to ensure a reliable supply of strategic materials in times of crisis," they wrote. A spokesman for the U.S. Treasury could not immediately be reached for comment on the letter.

The free program features safe viewings of the sun during the Cosmic Party and guided tours of the night sky during the Star Party. (Roberto E. Rosales/Journal) .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... ..........Many of the sciences can be intimidating, but Dee Friesen said astronomy is not like that. “Most people sometime in the past have had a pleasant experience with the night sky,” said Friesen, past president of The Albuquerque Astronomical Society. “They don’t equate the night sky with physics or elemental particles. They equate it with a fun camping trip, looking at the Milky Way.” Fun is at the heart of programs TAAS is presenting Saturday afternoon and night at the Open Space Visitor Center, 6500 Coors NW. The Cosmic Carnival from 1 to 5 p.m. will include interactive exhibits by TAAS, Explora! Science Center, the New Mexico Museum of Natural History and Science, the National Museum of Nuclear Science and History, Sandia National Laboratories and others. Advertisement Continue reading “There will be exhibits like ‘Lenses and Telescopes: How Do They Work’ and ‘Black Holes,'” Friesen said. “And we will have telescopes — three, four or five of them — specially designed with proper filters to safely observe the sun.” TAAS members will offer two programs — “The Vastness of the Universe” and “Getting to Know Astronomy” at 2 and 3 p.m. in the center’s media room. And at 1, 2, 3, and 4 p.m., there will be Portable Planetarium Shows in the center’s Kiva Room. Each show is limited to 25 people. Free same day tickets will be available in the lobby. Friesen will be there during the daytime Cosmic Carnival, but he really comes into his own during the nighttime Star Party. He said TAAS will have eight to a dozen telescopes on the visitor center patio so the public can do some star gazing. And then at 7 and 8 p.m. in the Kiva Room, Friesen and Sterling Beeson will present the “TAAS Fabulous Fifty” program. “The purpose of this program is to take people who have never looked at the night sky and provide them with a starting point,” Friesen said. “We have identified 50 bright objects in the night sky. Not all these objects are visible at the same time. It’s seasonal. The stars you see in the summer are not the stars you see in the winter.” Stars people will see tonight, of course, are in the fall sky. Advertisement Continue reading “The bright star Alpheratz in the constellation Andromeda is an example of a star we will show them,” Friesen said. “We will look at the constellations Cassiopeia, Pegasus and Perseus. Planets are low in the southern sky now, so we won’t see them. But we will see the Andromeda Galaxy, known as M31, which is 2.5 million light years away and is the most distant object visible to the human naked eye. The whole idea is that people can see these (bright) objects with their naked eyes.” If the rain and clouds forecast for Saturday actually happen, Friesen said the indoor portions of the daytime and evening program will be presented anyway. Friesen, 72, an Albuquerque resident since 1983, has a master’s degree in physics from the University of Nevada. He has taught at the Air Force Academy and is an adjunct professor at New Mexico Tech in Socorro. A pilot who flew F-4s for the Air Force and Boeing 757s and 767s for American Airlines, he has come closer to the sky than the other side of a telescope. But it was a little telescope with a 4-inch reflector that launched Friesen into the heavens when he was a 14-year-old farm kid in Kansas. “I sold a calf to buy that little telescope,” he said. “I remember that when my parents’ friends came over, I’d take them out into the farmyard so they could look at the sky.” Saturday night at the Open Space Visitor Center, he’ll be doing just what he did on that Kansas farm all those years ago — helping people look at the stars. “For the Fabulous Fifty program, we give a presentation of about 30 minutes and then we go outside and point these things out,” he said. “People don’t have to know anything about astronomy before they come. The only thing they need to be able to do is look up.” Share Tweet LinkedIn Print Subscribe ABQnews Seeker Rio Rancho News Suggested Stories: Star party Saturday on Albuquerque's west side – Feb 26, 2013 Astronomical group hosts star-gazing – Apr 23, 2015 Look up in the sky, it's a Star Party – Nov 5, 2015 Astronomy program is chance to party with the stars – Nov 5, 2016 Advertisement Comments Subscribe to the Journal for only $12.

EMBED </>More News Videos <iframe width="476" height="267" src="http://abc7.com/video/embed/?pid=1590039" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe> A job event on Friday aims to provide employment opportunities to veterans as part of Mayor Eric Garcetti's 10,000 Strong Veterans Hiring Initiative. (KABC) KABC By Leslie Lopez and ABC7.com staff Friday, November 04, 2016 LOS ANGELES (KABC) -- A job event on Friday aims to provide employment opportunities to veterans as part of Mayor Eric Garcetti's 10,000 Strong Veterans Hiring Initiative. The event was scheduled for 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. at Goodwill's Community Enrichment Center at Fletcher Square, located at 3150 N. San Fernando Road in Glassell Park. The hiring event is being held by Goodwill Southern California (GSC), the mayor's Office of Veterans Affairs and the County of Los Angeles Community and Senior Services. According to a press release from GSC, the event aims to help returning service members turn their skills into fulfilling careers by making the hiring process more effective and efficient. "It's a stressful time period. You lose a lot of your support system when you come out into this side of the world, and there was a lot of things I didn't know about. I had never submitted a resume, I never applied for a job, so here, what Goodwill does is it teaches you how to do those things," said John Gutierrez, an employment program manager at Goodwill, and also a veteran. Participating veterans will be pre-screened to match specific employment criteria identified by partnering employers, and in some cases, may be hired on-site, the press release stated. Participating employers include Federal Express, Cheesecake Factory, LA Metro, Boeing, Northrop Grumman, Walmart, Target, Live Nation, local cities, police and fire departments, the Los Angeles Unified School District and more, officials said. Air Force veteran Christina Yeung was one of many who attended the hiring event. "I think the sheriff's department, also the unified school district. I really want to be able to get out there and help someone," Yeung said. In addition to career resources, Clothes The Deal, an organization that provides business attire for veterans, also provided services at the hiring event. "While I was in the military, I was in uniform for the most part. When I left, I probably had about two suits, they were both black, and it was just for formal dinners. A lot of the vets that we get are kind of in that place. They're so used to wearing camouflage that they don't have that interview attire," Gutierrez said. Job seekers who would like to attend the hiring event should call (323) 543-8440 or e-mail sconliffe@goodwillsocal.org to register. Some employers require online application and resume submission prior to the event. According to GSC, the city of Los Angeles is close to meeting its goal of hiring 10,000 Veterans by 2017. "We're at 8,150 right now, so we're well ahead of schedule, and what we're doing is we're working with all of our nonprofit partners," said Blas Villalobos with the mayor's Office of Veterans Affairs.

Army researchers are searching for a sandphobic coating. (Photo Credit: U.S. Army) VIEW ORIGINAL ABERDEEN PROVING GROUND, Md. -- Armor offers reliable protection against external forces, but what if the enemy is so small that it can take aircraft down from the inside? Sand and dust can significantly damage helicopter engines, which is why scientists and engineers at the Army Research Laboratory are experimenting with coatings in high-temperature environments with the goal of creating something -- anything -- that will cause sand to slide off the inside of a turbine engine the way an egg slides off a nonstick skillet. "We are going through a very methodical process to understand the underpinning science and then use the science to predict the materials, what we call the engineered or tailored materials, that will lead to the right solution," explained Dr. Anindya Ghoshal, chief scientist for the laboratory's Vehicle Technology Directorate. Ghoshal leads the Army's efforts to develop what he calls "sandphobic" coatings. In regions like Southwest Asia, he said, Army forces frequently must contend with brown-out conditions, during which sand particulates and other dust particulates are ingested into the engines. "Our goal is to have the particles strike the blades or vanes [inside a gas turbine engine] and then flake off," he said. "When we started looking into this problem, we found ... we want to understand the physical, chemical behavior. Once we can do that, then our idea is to take that model and then predict the type of material that would enable us to develop this sandphobic coating." Helicopters already have filtration systems that attempt to filter out larger particles, but Ghoshal said micron-sized particles can pass through the turbine's combustor and adhere to the blades. This chokes the airflow and can lead to engine loss. "We have a unique rig here," said Dr. Michael Walock, a physicist on the sandphobic coatings team. "The hot particulate ingestion rig allows us to shoot sand into the hot-gas flow at small level components and rapidly prototype new coating materials. With this system we've done a world-first. We used high-speed imaging to confirm the molten state of the sand particles impacting onto these thermal barrier coatings." Computer simulations are also helping researchers arrive at a technology solution. "Computer modeling will play a big role in helping us to look at the interactions between particles and the surface," said Dr. Muthuvel Murugan, acting team lead for the lab's Turbomachinery Research Team. "The particles go through a phase change from solid to liquid and then they deposit onto the surface." At the Army's Vehicle Research Laboratory, the team shot high-speed videos, revealing molten sand particles splattering on turbine blade material targets and then vaporizing -- a first in the scientific community. "Computer modeling of this multi-physics complex phenomena will allow us to understand the damage mechanisms," Murugan said. Murugan said they hope to use the power of supercomputers at the Department of Defense High Performance Computing Center also located at APG. "We will use advanced computational fluid dynamics, together with particle ingestion, to better understand the interaction mechanisms of sand particles at a gas-turbine-engine-relevant high temperature," he said. "When we simulate how particles go through the flow-field and impact and adhere to the surface, then we can understand the vulnerable parts of the turbine blade and engineer a sandphobic coatings solution." Sandphobic coatings research is part of a larger strategic effort the Army lab officials call the Science for Maneuver Campaign. "With this campaign, we hope to discover, innovate and transition science and technology-enabled capabilities that will significantly increase the force effectiveness and global responsiveness of the Army," said acting ARL Director Dr. Philip Perconti. "As we look to how we're going to enable the Army of the future, we see a need to discover technology solutions that will result in improvements in aviation responsiveness and the minimization of vulnerabilities." Earlier this year, Ghoshal's team received DOD funding through the Laboratory University Collaboration Initiative, or LUCI, which means $600,000 over three years in collaboration with a National Security Science and Engineering Faculty fellow. Ghoshal is teaming with Dr. Jian Luo at the University of California San Diego. "There is a close collaboration going on within the community to solve this problem," Ghoshal said. Ghoshal is also working closely with other universities, industry and government agencies, such as The Ohio State University; University of Connecticut; University of North Texas; Iowa State University; University of North Dakota; Boeing; the Army Aviation and Missile Research, Development and Engineering Center; the Air Force Research Laboratory; the Naval Air Systems Command; and NASA. In 2015, the team presented initial findings, "Turbomachinery Blade Thermomechanical Interface Science and Sandphobic Coatings Research," to the American Helicopter Society International 71st Annual Forum at Virginia Beach, Virginia. The paper received the "Best Paper Award in Propulsion Sessions" at the conference, Ghoshal said. New research from the team will also be published in the January 2017 Advances in Aircraft and Spacecraft Sciences, an international journal. "I strongly believe that, in the next three to five years, we will have not only one, but several solutions," Ghoshal said. "It will definitely save a lot of Soldiers' lives in the long run. Our solutions will make our Soldiers' lives safe and will make our Army stronger." ----- The U.S. Army Research Laboratory is part of the U.S. Army Research, Development and Engineering Command, which has the mission to ensure decisive overmatch for unified land operations to empower the Army, the joint warfighter and our nation.

Post Your Comments Share Cancel | 1 Comments Aviation regulator DGCA has sought from Jet Airways details of the flights it had cancelled and delayed recently after some of its pilots reported sick amid an acute shortage of flight crew, particularly in its narrow body fleet. Jet Airways has also been asked to provide details of the pilots who are "habitual" of reporting sick and disrupting the airline's schedule, an official said. The Mumbai-headquartered airline, which is already facing paucity of pilots to carry out its operations in a smooth manner, had cancelled 50-odd flights on Tuesday and Wednesday after a section of its pilots did not turn up for duty despite being rostered in protest against the malfunctioning of its new crew rostering management system. "We have asked Jet Airways to provide us details of the flights it cancelled on November 1 and November 2. It has been asked to provide the number of flights it cancelled as well as the number of pilots who reported sick," a senior DGCA official said today. The airline has also been told to provide details of the pilots who do not turn up for duty and keep passengers waiting inside the aircraft. Jet Airways requires at least 200 more pilots to carry out its operations in a seamless manner, with its Boeing 737 fleet taking the maximum hit due to the inadequate number of flight crew in the airline, sources had said. Bollywood star Abhishek Bachchan had last week hit out at the airline after his flight to Chennai from Mumbai was allegedly delayed due to non-availability of flight crew. "Flying to Chennai. Baggage, check. Board flight on time, check. Seat belt fastened, check. Only thing we need now are our pilots!!...Well done Jet Airways!!! Entire plane boarded without any pilots on board. Still waiting and hoping...," he had said in a series of tweets over the nearly one-and-a-half- hour delay. The full service carrier is second largest airline in terms of number of domestic operations after no-frills IndiGo, operating more than 600 domestic and international flights every day. The airline at present has around 1,200 pilots to operate its fleet of 117 aircraft comprising Boeing 777s, B737s, Airbus A330s and ATRs. Almost two-thirds of its fleet consist of B737s. As part of the winter schedule, which became effective from late last month, Jet Airways would operate 3,010 flights per week while its subsidiary JetLite 507 flights per week.

The move comes as carriers in the U.S. and around the world are rolling out new premium economy class seating for their long-range jetliners, aimed at filling the increasing gulf between the front and back of the plane. The new premium economy class, dubbed ‘Delta Premium’ will add a new class of seating onto its upcoming Airbus A350s, which begin international service in late 2017. The new section will be arranged at eight seats across each row, with two outermost seats separated by the aisles. Each 19-inch wide seat will feature a 13.3-inch in-flight entertainment screen, in-seat power ports and 38 inches of pitch, a measurement of the distance between the same point on two seats. That’s about six to seven inches of additional legroom and an inch wider than standard economy seating. In addition to the larger seat, passengers on-board will receive a beverage before departure, an amenity kit, premium blanket and noise canceling headphones. At the airport a Delta Premium ticket will get you faster check-in and security lines, as well as earlier boarding and expedited baggage return. Delta’s move follows American Airlines introduction of a premium economy class for its long-haul jetliners as well. Airlines around the world such as Lufthansa, Singapore Airlines, Cathay Pacific, Air New Zealand, Air France and Iberia have all added new premium economy sections to their planes. As opulent first class seats have faded from use, airlines have focused on courting high-value business travelers with fully lie-flat seat beds and other hotel-like amenities. Such tickets can run as much as a compact car, while an economy class seat has remained largely the same through the history of jet flying, wildly separating a passenger’s experience. Airlines are seeking to tap into a quickly growing market for more-frugal business travelers and economy fliers who are willing to value comfort and space over the price of a seat, said Henry Harteveldt, founder of the Atmosphere Research Group. “As they develop these [premium economy] products there’s a balance between the premium side and the economy side,” said Harteveldt. “You want it attractive enough to attract someone from a standard economy fare…but you don’t want it to be so good that someone who usually flies business class will trade down to premium economy.” The Atlanta-based airline will first fit its new long-range A350s with 48 Delta Premium seats, and plans to deploy the new class on its Boeing 777s starting in 2018. Delta said its other jets may be added over time. Delta also plans to introduce an all-new business class seat with fully-closing door on its A350s. American’s own competing premium economy seating debuts on international flights starting with its new Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner on Thursday night, connecting Dallas-Fort Worth to Sao Paulo and Dallas-Fort Worth to Madrid Friday evening. The airline currently sells those seats under its Main Cabin Extra economy product rather than a distinct class, that begins next year. Neither Delta nor American have said how much their new premium seats will cost compared to a standard economy fare.   TM & © 2016 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

Jordan Chittley/The Globe and Mail Jordan Chittley The Globe and Mail Last updated: Thursday, Nov. 03, 2016 12:14PM EDT Share via email Share on facebook Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on Google Shares Comment s Anna Carroca casually strolls into action as a loud, piercing bell rings throughout the beige marble halls of a four-storey office town in downtown Toronto. She walks into a green, cream-and-gold elevator cab, looks up at the panel for the requested floor, closes the cage door, grasps a black lever and pushes it to the left, and the elevator shoots toward the sky. Jordan Chittley/The Globe and Mail “Left is going up and right is going down,” Carroca says, as we soar up the elevator shaft. “It has a brake, and you have full power to stop as if you were driving a car.” After 14 years at the elevator controls, Carroca makes it look easy. She jokes with tenants and rarely misses floors. If the operator doesn’t stop in the right spot, he or she may have to readjust or force a passenger to step up or down into the cab. She won’t let me operate it because there is a risk of damaging the elevator. Self-driving cars Take a drive in a 108-year-old manually controlled elevator in Toronto 2:02 Most elevators were manually operated before the Second World War. Today, this one, built in 1908 at the Ontario Heritage Centre at 10 Adelaide St. E., is one of a few remaining in Toronto. Others are at the Goodenham (Flatiron) building, the Masonic Temple and the Gladstone Hotel. “It’s a very rare and vanishing type,” says Romas Bubelis, architect with the Ontario Heritage Trust. “The visceral feeling you have as the air rushes by as you move up through the elevator shaft and being dependent on the elevator operator’s hand … is anything but a dead automatic experience.” The historic Birkbeck building at 10 Adelaide Street East in Toronto in the 1930s Ontario Heritage Trust In the middle of the 19th century, Elisha Otis invented a game-changing safety mechanism that prevented an elevator from falling even if its cable broke, says Rob Isabelle, CEO of KJA, an elevator-consulting firm. By the turn of the 20th century, electric, manually operated elevators were commonplace in New York and were being installed in Toronto buildings. “Most buildings into the 1950s had people waiting there to take you,” says Lee Gray, professor of architectural history at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, and author of a book about the history of elevators. “Until we get to the 1950s there is a recognition the elevator needs a driver … You couldn’t get by without an operator because you or I couldn’t drive the car. I tried to do it once and missed by six inches.” In the early 1950s, push-button elevators were introduced en masse. Building owners could save money on operators and automated elevators increased efficiency and capacity. But there was a problem – people hated them. “We have clear stories of people walking into elevators and walking right back out,” Gray says. “Passengers were saying, ‘I don’t want to drive this thing, where is the operator?’” Many people didn’t feel comfortable giving up control to a machine, where all they had to do was push a button. The call bell on a manually controlled elevator built in 1908 at 10 Adelaide Street East in Toronto. Jordan Chittley/The Globe and Mail It took most of that decade for people to become comfortable pushing the button on their own – and the elevator is a vehicle that only goes up and down attached to wires in a shaft. “Like any new technology, people got used to it very quickly and now we don’t even think about it,” Bubelis says.

We aren’t actually on a plane, but in a flight simulator in Mississauga, for Johnson to demonstrate how the autopilot system works. He’s looking at small, out-of-date screens, pushing buttons and turning small knobs. There are hundreds of them. Capt. Rob Johnson sits in the pilot’s seat in a simulator at uFly in Mississauga, Ont. Jordan Chittley/The Globe and Mail “Once you lift off and fly the aircraft off the runway, gear is coming up, engage the automation, you can leave it [autopilot] in all the way until you disconnect for the final approach,” says Johnson, who has been piloting aircraft for 45 years – including fighter jets and on 15-hour flights on Boeing 777s. “Some [pilots] leave it in until 300 or 400 feet above the runway.” About a minute after the rubber leaves the tarmac, Johnson hits one button, double checks some settings and then calmly removes his hands from the yoke. Blink, and you’d miss the computer taking control. Self-Driving Cars How autopilot works and how it has changed flying 2:19 Johnson says pilots use autopilot 99 per cent of the time, and it can be used at many airports to land. But the system is only as good as the information input by the pilot. Autopilot allows pilots to focus on other issues such as navigating around approaching weather. Prior to autopilot, flying was a grueling, dangerous experience. It was cold, windy and insanely loud – plus oil flew everywhere and the pilot had to constantly pull the plane to the left to compensate for the rotary engine. Constant attention was required to keep the plane on a straight course. “The sheer physical fatigue that came from flying could quickly wear a man down, something not easy to understand for those of us who fly cosseted in the passenger cabin of a jet liner,” Lee Kennett wrote in his 1991 book, The First Air War. In 1912, Sperry Corp. developed the first autopilot system. It connected a gyroscopic heading indicator and attitude indicator to hydraulically operate elevators and rudders (the devices that move the plane up, down and side to side). It allowed the plane to fly straight and level on a compass course with little attention from the pilot. Inventor Lawrence Sperry showed it off in 1914 by flying past onlookers in Paris with his hands up in the air and off the controls. “Over Ohio the other day, a big tri-motored Ford plowed through the air on its way to Washington, D.C. Four men leaned back at ease in the passenger cabin. Yet the pilot’s compartment was empty. A metal airman, scarcely larger than an automobile battery, was holding the stick,” begins a February 1930 article in Popular Science Monthly. “The sensitiveness of the robot in responding to movements of the plane is said to be superior to that of the average human pilot.” Aviation historian Keith Hyde says pilots were initially skeptical of autopilot and wary of turning over control, but technology improved over decades. “Today, a pilot, even though he has to go through the courses … doesn’t have much to do [while flying],” Hyde says. The cockpit of a Boeing 777 flight simulator at uFly in Mississagua, Ont. uFly As we approach the landing strip in Montreal, a pleasant voice announces how many feet we are above the ground. Johnson monitors the screens and keeps his hands close to the controls, but doesn’t touch them. The plane lands smoothly, but a little to the left, so Johnson disengages the system and drives it back to centre. So why do we still need pilots? To make the decisions, Johnson says. “You program bad information and it will give you bad results,” he says. “The pilot in command is ultimately responsible for the safety of the aircraft … Somebody has to mind the store.” 104 years after the first autopilot, the system can do a lot, but it can’t take responsibility. This is the first article in a seven-part multimedia series on self-driving cars that examines the past, the current technology and what the future may hold.

(Xinhua/Liang Xu) ZHUHAI, Nov. 3  -- On Wednesday, China's Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC) and Russia's United Aircraft Corporation (UAC) revealed their latest progress in a joint venture to develop a long-range wide-body aircraft. According to UAC President Yury Slyusar, the UAC will be responsible for the development of the wings, while COMAC will be in charge of the fuselage. "We value very much on self-made commercial aircraft and we need capable partners to achieve that. China has the ability, as we can see from the successful development of their ARJ21 and C919 aircraft," said Slyusar in an interview with Xinhua. From merely a supplier of aircraft components to a partner that designs and manufactures the aircraft, China is playing a bigger role in the world's aviation market. At the ongoing 11th China International Aviation & Aerospace Exhibition in Zhuhai, south China's Guangdong Province, a number of international products on display involve some "China elements." The Airbus A350, for example, involves a number of patented technologies developed by Chinese engineers. According to Airbus, Chinese companies manufactured 5 percent of the aircraft. "Airbus created A350 together with China," said Chen Juming, president of Airbus China. "Airbus showed its commitment in cooperating with China by allowing Chinese engineers to participate." On Tuesday, Honeywell announced that it would work with Aero Engine Corporation of China (AECC) on a number of initiatives concerning aircraft engines. Steven Lien, president of Honeywell Aerospace Asia Pacific, described the cooperation as "expertise sharing." "Honeywell has been an important industry player in the development of engines since 1953," he said. "This agreement between Honeywell and AECC is a new way to share expertise and explore new opportunities." Besides sharing its technical know-how to global aviation giants, China is also playing a bigger role contributing to the industry's growth. On Tuesday, Boeing signed an agreement with COMAC to expand their joint research collaboration in support of the long-term sustainable growth of commercial aviation. Through the new agreement signed at the Zhuhai Airshow, the companies will explore research in areas such as sustainable aviation fuel and better recycling of materials. "Boeing and COMAC are expanding our efforts to ensure commercial aviation's long-term sustainable growth, improve its efficiency and reduce environmental impact," said Ian Chang, vice president of supplier management China operations and business development at Boeing Commercial Airplanes. In the future, Boeing would like to deal with Chinese companies in a broader scope, said John Bruns, president of Boeing China. "Almost every Boeing aircraft in service globally has some 'made in China' element," he said. "We can clearly see that how much progress that China's aviation industry has made."

 Text Size: A | A 21ST CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT  In 2014, when Democrat Bill Owens retired from Congress, many observers thought the House seat representing the North Country would be a tight race. In the end, though, Republican Elise Stefanik won handily to become the youngest woman ever to serve in Congress, at age 30. Stefanik is running for re-election this year in a contest that has seen less national attention than two years ago, but where campaigners are nevertheless spending millions of dollars. Stefanik has more money than Democrat Mike Derrick or Matt Funiciello, the Green Party candidate who garnered more than 10 percent of the vote two years ago and is running again. Stefanik, now 32, of Willsboro, Essex County, also has voter enrollment statistics on her side as she seeks to return to Congress. Elise Stefanik Elise Stefanik AGE: 32 HOME: Willsboro OCCUPATION: Congresswoman FAMILY: Engaged PARTY: Republican, Conservative, Independence, Reform New enrollment figures released this week show that the 21st Congressional District has 181,395 registered Republicans, 130,678 Democrats and 97,544 independent voters. The biggest gain in the last two years has been in independent voters, state Board of Elections statistics show. Polls show Stefanik with a substantial lead among likely voters. Stefanik, part of the conservative Republican majority in the House of Representatives, has highlighted her support for programs that help veterans and farmers. The district, which includes Fort Drum on the outskirts of Watertown, has the highest percentage of veterans of any district in New York state. “I have outworked my opponents and put forth original solutions,” Stefanik said at a candidate forum last month in Queensbury. Derrick is a retired Army officer from Peru, in Clinton County, the small town where he grew up and returned to after his military career, which included combat service in Iraq. He retired with the rank of colonel. “Two things have shaped me: growing up in Peru, New York, and service in the United States Army,” Derrick said. He believes more money needs to be spent on education and transportation and broadband infrastructure, and he has called for tax reform. “The wealthy and the powerful are not paying their fair share,” Derrick said. On the campaign trail, Derrick has regularly attacked Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump. Trump “has neither the character or the competence to be president of the United States,” he said. Mike Derrick William “Mike” Derrick AGE: 54 HOME: Peru OCCUPATION: Retired, 28-year U.S. Army veteran FAMILY: Married, four children PARTY: Democrat, Working Families Stefanik has tried to avoid discussing Trump, even fleeing from reporters, but has indicated she will not buck national GOP leaders who support him. Funiciello, of Glens Falls and owner of the Rock Hill Bakery in that city, said the nasty character of the presidential election has excluded discussion of issues important to the Green Party, including economic inequality, national health care and the environment. “I am proud to be a member of the working class,” Funiciello said at the Queensbury candidate forum. “We need to have the unique voice that comes from someone living in the district every day.” The 21st Congressional District is the geographically largest in the state, stretching from Ballston Spa in Saratoga County to the Canadian border, and from Lake Champlain to Lake Ontario. With media markets in the Capital Region, Watertown and Plattsburgh, both major party candidates have invested heavily in television advertising. As of Oct. 19, Stefanik had raised more than $2.9 million and spent more than $2.2 million, which left her with $753,433 in the bank, according to federal records. She has raised $1.35 million from dozens of political action committees, including the corporate PACs of such industrial giants as Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Coca-Cola and Wal-Mart. Koch Industries, run by the conservative Koch brothers, has donated $10,000 to her through its PAC. Matt Funiciello Matt Funiciello AGE: 49 HOME: Glens Falls OCCUPATION: Bakery owner FAMILY: Unmarried PARTY: Green Stefanik has also raised $1.27 million from individuals. Stefanik “is a Washington insider who is dedicated to party politics,” Derrick said. Derrick had raised $1.16 million and spent $1.1 million through Oct. 19, leaving him with $61,581 cash on hand. Derrick has raised $150,000 from political action committees, including some for labor unions and some from other Democrats’ campaign funds. He has raised $1 million from individuals. In contrast to such high-profile races at the John Faso-Zephyr Teachout race in the 19th Congressional District, only $217,000 has been spent by independent political committees, and all of it has been spent in support of Stefanik. The GOP’s Congressional Leadership Fund last month announced plans to spend $500,000 in the Watertown and Albany media markets, but that spending hasn’t yet shown up in federal filings. “In just two years, Elise Stefanik has delivered for her district and stood as a conservative, results-oriented leader in Congress,” said PAC spokeswoman Ruth Guerra. Funiciello, who has pointedly said he is accepting no corporate contributions, has raised $13,900, and had $7,563 of it left to spend as of Oct. 19. None of the candidates are providing significant self-funding. Reach Gazette reporter Stephen Williams at 395-3086, swilliams@dailygazette.net or @gazettesteve on Twitter. Enjoy this story? Share it!

The move comes as carriers in the U.S. and around the world are rolling out new premium economy class seating for their long-range jetliners, aimed at filling the increasing gulf between the front and back of the plane. The new premium economy class, dubbed ‘Delta Premium’ will add a new class of seating onto its upcoming Airbus A350s, which begin international service in late 2017. The new section will be arranged at eight seats across each row, with two outermost seats separated by the aisles. Each 19-inch wide seat will feature in-seat power ports and 38 inches of pitch, a measurement of the distance between the same point on two seats. That’s about six inches of additional legroom and an inch wider than standard economy seating. In addition to the larger seat, passengers on-board will receive a beverage before departure, an amenity kit, premium blanket noise canceling headphones. At the airport an Delta Premium ticket will get you faster check-in and security lines, as well as earlier boarding and expedited baggage return. Delta’s move follows American Airlines introduction of a premium economy class for its long-haul jetliners as well. Airlines around the world such as Lufthansa, Singapore Airlines, Cathay Pacific, Air New Zealand, Air France and Iberia have all added new premium economy sections to their planes. As opulent first class seats have faded from use, airlines have focused on courting high-value business travelers with fully lie-flat seat beds and other hotel-like amenities. Such tickets can run as much as a compact car, while an economy class seat has remained largely the same through the history of jet flying, wildly separating a passenger’s experience. Airlines are seeking to tap into a quickly growing market for more-frugal business travelers and economy fliers who are willing to value comfort and space over the price of a seat, said Henry Harteveldt, founder of the Atmosphere Research Group. “As they develop these [premium economy] products there’s a balance between the premium side and the economy side,” said Harteveldt. “You want it attractive enough to attract someone from a standard economy fare…but you don’t want it to be so good that someone who usually flies business class will trade down to premium economy.” The Atlanta-based airline will first fit its new long-range A350s with 48 Delta Premium seats, and plans to deploy the new class on its Boeing 777s starting in 2018. Delta said its other jets may be added over time. Delta also plans to introduce an all-new business class seat with fully-closing door on its A350s. American’s own competing premium economy seating debuts on international flights starting with its new Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner on Thursday night, connecting Dallas-Fort Worth to Sao Paulo and Dallas-Fort Worth to Madrid Friday evening. The airline currently sells those seats under its Main Cabin Extra economy product rather than a distinct class, that begins next year. Neither Delta nor American have said how much their new premium seats will cost compared to a standard economy fare.

The trades are coming in the form of bonds whose performance is tied to a group of shares. Leonteq AG, a Swiss provider of structured products, has seen “strong interest” for such notes in Singapore, said Frank Troise, head of digital distribution in the Asian city-state. He declined to provide sales figures, but said that more than four-fifths of the notes his firm has sold have bet on Clinton becoming the 45th President of the United States. "Investors are voting with their wallets," Troise said. "The expectation is that markets will rally substantially if Clinton does win." Clinton’s odds of winning were around 66 percent on Friday, according to poll aggregator FiveThirtyEight. Her chances have fallen from 82 percent on Oct. 27, the day before the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation said it had reopened its investigation into Clinton’s use of a personal e-mail server. Swiss bank Vontobel Holding AG is selling structured notes linked to stocks that should perform well if Clinton wins, as well as similar debt that would benefit from a Donald Trump victory. Eric Blattmann, head of public distribution of financial products at the bank and asset manager, reported sales of at least $10 million of notes that profit on either a Clinton or trump win. A Twist The Vontobel notes feature an unusual twist: they will only be issued if the candidate that clients are betting on actually wins. If an investor buys Clinton notes and Trump wins, customers will receive their money back. Both Clinton and Trump notes tend to include exposure to infrastructure companies such as Caterpillar Inc., because both candidates have promised to push for greater investment in highways, bridges and other projects.  A Clinton win could be a boon for hospital operators such as HCA Holdings Inc. , which may benefit from continued Affordable Care Act subsidies, according to analysts from Credit Suisse Group AG. HCA is in Vontobel’s “ Clinton” note, as is United Parcel Service Inc., which could benefit from the fact the candidate is seen as more supportive of trade than her opponent.   Banks, Defense Vontobel’s “ Trump”certificates are tied to U.S banks including JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc., as well as military contractors including Boeing Co. and Honeywell International Inc. Trump has spoken about repealing and replacing the Dodd-Frank Act, which requires banks to trim some risk-taking, fund their businesses with more capital, and submit to more oversight. Cutting back or ending that law could boost banks’ near-term profits, and financial companies’ shares have tended to be the most closely tied of any industry to Trump’s chances. Trump has also proposed increases in defense spending. Leonteq is selling one-year notes that offer relatively high income, but if a candidate loses, the client will lose principal. For example, one Clinton note yields 14.3 percent, and is tied to shares of several hospital providers, including HCA. If one of the stocks drops 35 percent or more, which is less likely under Clinton, the client will lose principal. One Trump note yields 17.08 percent, and is tied to shares of several student lending companies, including SLM Corp. If one of the stocks falls 35 percent, which is less likely if the real estate magnate wins, the client will lose principal. While equity-linked notes have been most popular, investors have also bought notes tied to currencies, according to Leonteq’s Troise. A Leonteq note bets on the dollar to strengthen against both sterling and the euro. “Sentiment is that the dollar will be stronger with a Clinton win. If Trump wins, we could see a market sell-off and the Fed cutting rates which would weaken the dollar,” said Troise. This story was originally published in Bloomberg Briefs: Structured Notes.

Urgency is not an excuse to get it wrong The I-732 campaign was built on, and still runs on, the politics of urgency without the policy substance of getting something done. First, it was an excuse for crafting the measure in isolation, a white male economist telling people of color we’re "using race and class as political weapons." Now urgency is used as an excuse to vote for a measure the backers themselves acknowledged is deeply flawed. They almost bailed on it when they had a chance, but got caught in different economics conundrum, sunk costs and the warm affirmation of good-old-boys talking only to each other. Washington voters must not follow this misguided path. For over a year, I’ve been mansplained by I-732 backers, most who live so far from the front lines of climate change they have no idea what real urgency feels like. As a Queer Filipino growing up working class in the US next to a polluted highway and a steel factory—someone who has been on the front lines of fossil fuel pollution, who has loved ones and family in the Philippines, and who has seen first-hand how increasing storms and flooding have shattered lives, and who organizes many other people like me—I know all too well the devastation that fossil fuel economy and climate change can cause. For real, you don’t have to convince me. Effective and equitable climate action is not a game to me, it’s not a "theory" to be proven or disproven; it is about survival for me and my community. Right now. But the reality is that I-732 will only cause harm to communities like mine. 2. Adding a buck to the price of gas will do nothing to reduce climate change without investing the revenue in clean, equitable communities.   "Revenue-neutral" carbon pricing was a scheme built for 1986 when we could cross our fingers and hope a slowly rising price for carbon would transition our economy off fossil fuels. But in 2016 we have years, not decades, before we’ve maxed out our global carbon budget to stay below a 1.5 or 2 degrees Celsius rise in temperature. I-732 would contribute virtually nothing to Washington’s share. By 2040, analysis shows, it would raise the cost of electricity around 7 percent and price of gas around 11 percent to just $4.40 a gallon. We had gas prices like that in 2012; it was hardly the low-carbon transportation future we’re looking for. We shouldn’t expect any different this time around. In fact, in British Columbia, the model for the Washington proposal, greenhouse gas emissions went up all while two thirds of carbon revenues now support corporate tax cuts. You can explain it away, but that is a fact. An effective carbon pricing policy, at a minimum, must drive overall emissions down—"revenue-neutral" carbon pricing does not. Climate change is not a horseshoes and hand-grenades situation, we need substantive action not misdirection. 3. I-732’s "revenue-neutral" tax-cuts approach to carbon pricing is a step in the wrong direction and would be a devastating precedent for global climate action Sending the world a signal that "revenue-neutral" carbon pricing is our best hope for climate action would be a death wish for this planet. In burning through well over a billion dollars of carbon revenue each year, I-732 spends millions on corporate tax cuts, perhaps $50 million dollars to Boeing alone. If others follow, trillions globally could go toward tax breaks, when what is really needed is trillions invested in clean and affordable energy, transportation and housing. There is no magical pot of money to make these large investments happen—carbon revenues are our best shot. But I-732 would set a harmful precedent by short-changing ambitious climate action. It’s no wonder that the fossil fuel industry has not opposed I-732. In fact, Exxon supports the revenue-neutral approach, even while the industry attempted to squash an investment oriented approach in California (and lost). I-732 short-changes critical investments at a time when we need to significantly ramp-up the fight to save our climate. This is not the best we can do. We need to set a worthy precedent that shows the world that climate policy can be done right, that we are prepared to invest in equitable climate solutions.   4. It Does Nothing to Create A Just Transition to a Cleaner Economy A tax rebate provides no new solutions for workers who need to enter clean energy jobs, for a mother that wants to catch a bus to work, or for a business that wants to invest in a green building. We will not be bought by cheap tricks. Creating a just transition for workers, for frontline communities, and creating low-carbon infrastructure is not just a moral obligation, it’s a tactical obligation for so called "climate hawks." We will never get to more ambitious climate solutions if we don’t support the people who are most harmed by fossil fuels and the people most impacted by the transition. Instead, if we take care of communities and workers everyone will benefit. 5. I-732 wants to be tax reform, but carbon revenues aren’t the relief we’ve been looking for Washington State desperately needs tax reform, and that means an income tax. We all know it. Swapping one regressive tax for another is not "progressive tax reform." Trying to confound climate action with tax policy is a recipe for disaster for both people with lower incomes and the planet. Carbon revenues must decline over time and putting support for low income families on a narrow and declining source of revenue only sets us up for disaster in the long run. Of course it’s ironic that I-732 supporters claim tax reform at the same time they create a giant hole in the state budget. The Washington State Office of Financial Management (OFM) published their findings that “during the first six fiscal years, state General Fund revenue would decrease by a net amount of $797.2 million.” No entity is better equipped to make these projections than the state itself, despite I-732 supporters and their buddy’s attempts to discredit the bad news. This massive state budget hole will hurt Black, Brown, and poor communities hardest.   6. That’s why most people who care deeply about the climate and communities don’t support I-732 Van Jones, Naomi Klein, Climate Solutions, the Washington Environmental Council, the Sierra Club, the Washington State Labor Council, The Children’s Alliance, the Washington State Democratic Party, OneAmerica, Puget Sound Sage, the Asian Pacific Islander Coalition—none of them support I-732. Moreover, editorial boards across the state, including four members of the Stranger Election Control Board, the Tacoma News Tribune, the Columbian, the Yakima Herald Republic, and influential sources like the Progressive Voters Guide—they all oppose I-732 because it won’t effectively reduce climate change, it supports corporations over communities, and there are better options available. Go to www.dontbeneutral.org to learn more. 7. We can do better There is a better way: let’s put a price on carbon and invest the money in green jobs, clean energy, and the communities hit first and worst by fossil fuels. California has already done this with great success and the idea is moving forward in legislation in New York too. We can do the same in Washington. It will take a broad coalition to win, but that is what we have been building both in communities of color and with allies from across sectors. A No vote on I-732 is a demonstration of our commitment to the world that we won’t be fooled by false promises. We need a Just Transition and effective climate action. © 2016 The Stranger Jill Mangaliman Jill Mangaliman is executive director of Got Green in Seattle, Washington.

Sourcing Network, a project of As You Sow, analyzes how companies monitor risk in their supply chains News provided by Responsible Sourcing Network Nov 03, 2016, 11:00 ET Share this article OAKLAND, Calif., Nov. 3, 2016  /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- On Friday, Responsible Sourcing Network (RSN), a project of As You Sow, will release a report and hold a webinar revealing which major brands are failing to or are leading in adequately protecting human rights and informing investors about their conflict minerals risk. Well-known brands play an important role in an international, multi-stakeholder strategy to break the links between minerals used in the manufacture of airplanes, smartphones, and countless other items, and the funding of militias in countries such as Colombia and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), where rape and mass killings are fueled by illegal minerals. Andrew Arriaga, lead author, said, "Protecting people at the heart of the supply chain is good business. With conflict minerals, we've seen some companies move from pleading powerlessness to integrating risk management into daily business practices, combining efforts across multiple industries, and creating replicable models that can address other issues, like forced labor." While leading brands proactively monitor and mitigate risk, laggards provide little evidence of good faith efforts. Berkshire Hathaway faulted suppliers for weak reporting and declined to identify smelters. In contrast, Microsoft exercised leverage with its suppliers to enforce conflict-free policies and apply pressure on smelters to perform due diligence. ExxonMobil prohibited suppliers from sourcing from the DRC region, contributing to a devastating embargo that prevents the development of a legitimate minerals trade and worsens the humanitarian crisis in the DRC. In contrast, Apple helped improve risk monitoring between mines and smelters; Phillips increased its demand for conflict-free tin sourced from within the DRC; and Boeing and GE supported research on child labor in the region. Intel continued its public campaign to support conflict-free mining in the DRC. "Full disclosures are fundamental to our evaluation of corporate risk management," said Susan Baker, Vice President at Trillium Asset Management. "This comparative analysis allows investors to better assess risk and the extent to which issuers are promoting ethically sourced minerals and economic development in the DRC and neighboring regions." Mining the Disclosures is RSN's annual analysis of conflict minerals reporting, ranking 200+ individual companies across 25+ industries in risk mitigation, human rights impact, and reporting quality. The report's insights have been adapted for use by experts across many disciplines, helping drive improvement in the ways companies protect miners and investors.

The pilot's Airbus A320 was about to take off from an airport in Shanghai last month when it encountered an Airbus A330 in its path along the runway, reports the People's Daily Online.  The pilot, named He Chao, chose to accelerate and fly over the other aircraft avoiding a head-on crash by just 19 metres (62 feet). A simulation shows the A330 was crossing the runway when the A320 was taking off The plane accelerated and managed to fly over the other aircraft missing it by just 62 feet The captain, He Chao (pictured), was praised for his actions after the incident on October 11 RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Thousands of extra prison guards to tackle violence and...

Share this article Share 8.1k shares The terrifying incident took place on runway 36L at Shanghai Hongqiao International Airport at 12:04pm on October 11. The flight MU-5643, an Airbus A320-200, was about to take off when the flight MU 5106, an Airbus A330-300, had just landed and was taxiing nearby. The Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) released a simulation of the incident during their investigation last month. The video shows the A320 was speeding up on the runway when Mr He spotted the A330 entering its runway just feet away.    At the time, the Airbus A320 was already travelling at approximately 240kmh (149mph), according to a statement on China Eastern Airlines' website. Mr He decided to accelerated and made a sharp climb. His aircraft narrowly missed the other plane.   The near-miss incident has shocked the Chinese media. Many have compared it to the Tenerife airport disaster, a fatal runway crash between two Boeing 747s that killed 583 people in 1977. Heroic actions: The captain of the flight, He Chao, was given £360,000 at a ceremony today Both aircraft involved in the near collision belong to China Eastern Airlines (file photo) China Eastern Airlines rewarded the quick-thinking pilot He Chao with the cash bonus during a ceremony earlier today. The cabin crew were also given 600,000 yuan (£71,000). According to an earlier article from People's Daily, there were 413 passengers and 26 crew in total on the two flights. Both aircraft involved in the near collision belong to China Eastern Airlines.  The Airbus A330 had flown from Beijing to Shanghai, carrying 266 passengers, while the Airbus A320 was taking off from Shanghai for Tianjin, carrying 147 passengers.  The terrifying incident took place at Shanghai Hongqiao International Airport on October 11 The map from Flightradar24 shows the path of the two flights and how they might have collided on the runway An investigation launched by China's aviation authority, CAAC, found that air traffic control were at fault for the incident. CAAC suggested that the control centre and the crew members of the A330 failed to maintain proper communication with the controller. The authority has revoked the licenses of two air traffic controllers responsible for the incident and punished 13 air traffic control officials from The Eastern China Air Control Bureau.  Read more: The Aviation Herald Captain rewarded with 3 million RMB for preventing collision at Shanghai airport - People's Daily Online ¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿400¿¿¿¿ ¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿_¿¿¿¿ ý¿¿¿¿¿_¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿ Share or comment on this article e-mail 8.1k shares Most watched News videos Mob storm police station and lynch suspected paedophile Man discovers wife is cheating on him following her with drone Ivanka Trump gives glimpse of her father's $100m penthouse Chili's manager snatches veteran's free meal after complaint Obama on Trump: This office has a way of waking you up 100 special police agents protect suspected paedophile from mob Killer wife and lover speak out over fatal love triangle Protestor at an anti-Trump rally at Ohio State gets slammed SNL mocks confident Clinton supporters with Dave Chappelle Obama's dig at Clinton over her ground game failures Emotional Chelsea Handler fights back tears over election results Dashcam footage captures moment van swerves before crashing 'Reality has a way of asserting itself!'

Transatlantic flights operated by Norwegian Air, Iceland's Wow air, Canada's WestJet and Morocco's Royal Air Maroc have multiplied in recent years as jet fuel has grown cheaper. Frequently offering fares less than half that of major airlines, low-cost carriers have quickly attracted travelers. Traditional players have seen their collective market share decline, dropping from 75 percent in the summer of 2014 to 72 percent this summer, according to the air travel data company OAG. While low-cost carriers remain small players, larger airlines "are looking over their shoulders," said George Hobica of airfarewatchdog.com. "They could be a growing threat as they add more seats," he told AFP. "Currently, if you look at the percentage of seats they have compared to major airlines, it's very small." - Half-price flights - Booked in advance, a round-trip flight between London and New York currently runs an average of $398 on the low-cost carriers, according to Hobica, compared to more than $600 with the major airlines. WestJet even has flights linking Canada and London at $149 (CAN$199). Even with other costs added in, such charges for meals, luggage and headphones, passengers can get a good deal, according to Hobica. Aware of the threat, the larger companies have not wasted time, offering cheaper seats, more direct flights and new connections. British Airways recently began serving a route between London and San Jose, California. Delta Air Lines, United and American, the three largest US companies, recently said they saw a drop in transatlantic traffic due to Britain's vote to quit the eurozone, terrorist attacks in Europe and overcapacity. Revenues could fall as a result. Transatlantic flights have long been the preserve of major airlines, protected by the Open Skies agreements between the United States and Europe. The agreements allowed these companies to form three partnerships -- SkyTeam, Atlantic and OneWorld -- and charge whatever rates they wanted. The first attempts at low-cost travel in this area were failures. Laker Airways, a 1970s forerunner, lasted less than 10 years after starting flights across the Atlantic. The game changed with the emergence of a new, more fuel-efficient generation of aircraft, such as Boeing's 787 Dreamliner and 737 MAX and Airbus's Neo and A350. "It is not sustainable to operate a low-cost model using old aircraft," Anders Lindstrom, communications director for Norwegian Air, said by email. The company, which posted third quarter earnings of $122 million, made its first transatlantic flight in 2013. - Cheaper fuel, cheaper tickets - The collapse of oil prices two years ago persuaded other companies to get in the game given that fuel is air carriers' greatest expense. WestJet spokesman Robert Palmer said by email, "Clearly there is a strong demand for low-cost, long-haul service in this country." Having battled for supremacy with major airlines in the United States, JetBlue and Southwest Airlines are no longer hiding their ambitions. The market for transatlantic flights suffers from the same lack of competition that transcontinental flights once did, JetBlue spokeswoman Tamara Young said. The company has purchased Airbus A321 aircraft that could link the US East Coast and Europe. "We will consider opportunities in Europe against other opportunities we are looking at," she said. While their attractive prices have opened doors, low-cost carriers still have to establish their good names, said Hobica of airfarewatchdog.com. "Are they safe? Are they reliable?" he said. "All they have is low fares. They don't have a reputation."   AFP / Expatica 0 Comments To This Article Leave a Reply Most Read Red letter day: PostNL rejects Belgian t...

MUST CREDIT: Bloomberg photo by Qilai Shen. (Qilai Shen / Bloomberg) (c) 2016, Bloomberg Even before China's domestically made C919 single-aisle jet takes flight, the nation already has its sights set on producing a much larger aircraft within a decade. Executives of state-owned Commercial Aircraft Corp. of China Ltd. unveiled plans Wednesday to make a twin-aisle jet that can fly as far as 12,000 kilometers (7,456 miles) - roughly the distance between Beijing and New York. The company, known as Comac, is forming a joint venture with Russia's United Aircraft Corp. to research on and manufacture the aircraft. The announcement at a biennial airshow in southern Zhuhai city marks the first time China has given details of the widebody aircraft since the planned Russian partnership was flagged two years ago and comes amid delays to the maiden flight of the C919. The new plane would be able to seat 280 people, posing a direct challenge to jetliners from Boeing and Airbus Group such as their current B777, B787, A330 and A350 models. Comac is targeting the maiden flight of the new aircraft to take place about seven years from now, and the first delivery three years after that. An assembly line will be set up in Shanghai, with an eye to exporting the plane to other markets in the future, said Guo Bozhi, an assistant president at Comac who's in charge of the widebody-jet project. "Developing an aircraft is an arduous journey and we have to overcome a lot of technical difficulties," Guo said at a briefing. But the timeframe "is a definite target," he said. He declined to provide financial figures on the joint venture and development of the twin-engine plane. Comac said Tuesday that China Eastern Airlines Corp. will be the first carrier to take delivery of the locally made C919, a day after Wu Guanghui, Comac's chief designer, said the narrowbody jet's test flight would take place later this year or in early 2017. The plane's maiden flight has been pushed back at least twice since 2014. Copyright © 2016, Chicago Tribune Breaking Sports Trending Opinion Suburbs Entertainment Business Advertising 47°

She walks into a green, cream-and-gold elevator cab, looks up at the panel for the requested floor, closes the cage door, grasps a black lever and pushes it to the left, and the elevator shoots toward the sky. Jordan Chittley/The Globe and Mail “Left is going up and right is going down,” Carroca says, as we soar up the elevator shaft. “It has a brake, and you have full power to stop as if you were driving a car.” After 14 years at the elevator controls, Carroca makes it look easy. She jokes with tenants and rarely misses floors. If the operator doesn’t stop in the right spot, he or she may have to readjust or force a passenger to step up or down into the cab. She won’t let me operate it because there is a risk of damaging the elevator. Self-driving cars Take a drive in a 108-year-old manually controlled elevator in Toronto 2:02 Most elevators were manually operated before the Second World War. Today, this one, built in 1908 at the Ontario Heritage Centre at 10 Adelaide St. E., is one of a few remaining in Toronto. Others are at the Goodenham (Flatiron) building, the Masonic Temple and the Gladstone Hotel. “It’s a very rare and vanishing type,” says Romas Bubelis, architect with the Ontario Heritage Trust. “The visceral feeling you have as the air rushes by as you move up through the elevator shaft and being dependent on the elevator operator’s hand … is anything but a dead automatic experience.” The historic Birkbeck building at 10 Adelaide Street East in Toronto in the 1930s Ontario Heritage Trust In the middle of the 19th century, Elisha Otis invented a game-changing safety mechanism that prevented an elevator from falling even if its cable broke, says Rob Isabelle, CEO of KJA, an elevator-consulting firm. By the turn of the 20th century, electric, manually operated elevators were commonplace in New York and were being installed in Toronto buildings. “Most buildings into the 1950s had people waiting there to take you,” says Lee Gray, professor of architectural history at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, and author of a book about the history of elevators. “Until we get to the 1950s there is a recognition the elevator needs a driver … You couldn’t get by without an operator because you or I couldn’t drive the car. I tried to do it once and missed by six inches.” In the early 1950s, push-button elevators were introduced en masse. Building owners could save money on operators and automated elevators increased efficiency and capacity. But there was a problem – people hated them. “We have clear stories of people walking into elevators and walking right back out,” Gray says. “Passengers were saying, ‘I don’t want to drive this thing, where is the operator?’” Many people didn’t feel comfortable giving up control to a machine, where all they had to do was push a button. The call bell on a manually controlled elevator built in 1908 at 10 Adelaide Street East in Toronto. Jordan Chittley/The Globe and Mail It took most of that decade for people to become comfortable pushing the button on their own – and the elevator is a vehicle that only goes up and down attached to wires in a shaft. “Like any new technology, people got used to it very quickly and now we don’t even think about it,” Bubelis says.

We aren’t actually on a plane, but in a flight simulator in Mississauga, for Johnson to demonstrate how the autopilot system works. He’s looking at small, out-of-date screens, pushing buttons and turning small knobs. There are hundreds of them. Capt. Rob Johnson sits in the pilot’s seat in a simulator at uFly in Mississauga, Ont. Jordan Chittley/The Globe and Mail “Once you lift off and fly the aircraft off the runway, gear is coming up, engage the automation, you can leave it [autopilot] in all the way until you disconnect for the final approach,” says Johnson, who has been piloting aircraft for 45 years – including fighter jets and on 15-hour flights on Boeing 777s. “Some [pilots] leave it in until 300 or 400 feet above the runway.” About a minute after the rubber leaves the tarmac, Johnson hits one button, double checks some settings and then calmly removes his hands from the yoke. Blink, and you’d miss the computer taking control. Self-Driving Cars How autopilot works and how it has changed flying 2:19 Johnson says pilots use autopilot 99 per cent of the time, and it can be used at many airports to land. But the system is only as good as the information input by the pilot. Autopilot allows pilots to focus on other issues such as navigating around approaching weather. Prior to autopilot, flying was a grueling, dangerous experience. It was cold, windy and insanely loud – plus oil flew everywhere and the pilot had to constantly pull the plane to the left to compensate for the rotary engine. Constant attention was required to keep the plane on a straight course. “The sheer physical fatigue that came from flying could quickly wear a man down, something not easy to understand for those of us who fly cosseted in the passenger cabin of a jet liner,” Lee Kennett wrote in his 1991 book, The First Air War. In 1912, Sperry Corp. developed the first autopilot system. It connected a gyroscopic heading indicator and attitude indicator to hydraulically operate elevators and rudders (the devices that move the plane up, down and side to side). It allowed the plane to fly straight and level on a compass course with little attention from the pilot. Inventor Lawrence Sperry showed it off in 1914 by flying past onlookers in Paris with his hands up in the air and off the controls. “Over Ohio the other day, a big tri-motored Ford plowed through the air on its way to Washington, D.C. Four men leaned back at ease in the passenger cabin. Yet the pilot’s compartment was empty. A metal airman, scarcely larger than an automobile battery, was holding the stick,” begins a February 1930 article in Popular Science Monthly. “The sensitiveness of the robot in responding to movements of the plane is said to be superior to that of the average human pilot.” Aviation historian Keith Hyde says pilots were initially skeptical of autopilot and wary of turning over control, but technology improved over decades. “Today, a pilot, even though he has to go through the courses … doesn’t have much to do [while flying],” Hyde says. The cockpit of a Boeing 777 flight simulator at uFly in Mississagua, Ont. uFly As we approach the landing strip in Montreal, a pleasant voice announces how many feet we are above the ground. Johnson monitors the screens and keeps his hands close to the controls, but doesn’t touch them. The plane lands smoothly, but a little to the left, so Johnson disengages the system and drives it back to centre. So why do we still need pilots? To make the decisions, Johnson says. “You program bad information and it will give you bad results,” he says. “The pilot in command is ultimately responsible for the safety of the aircraft … Somebody has to mind the store.” 104 years after the first autopilot, the system can do a lot, but it can’t take responsibility.

BusinessM&A US lawmakers seek to block Chinese aluminum bid Zhongwang International's US$2.3b bid for Aleris risks handing over sensitive research and technology, senators say By Reuters November 3, 2016 11:05 AM (UTC+8) Share Tweet Linkedin Print Email Share 0 Comment 0 Twelve US senators on Wednesday urged that a national security review panel reject Chinese aluminum giant Zhongwang International Group’s proposed US$2.3 billion purchase of US aluminum products maker Aleris Corp. The senators asked Treasury Secretary Jack Lew in a letter to launch a review of the deal by the Committee on Foreign Investments in the United States and “ultimately reject it” on grounds that it would damage the US defense industrial base. “Zhongwang’s purchase of Aleris would directly undermine our national security, including by jeopardizing the US manufacturing base for sensitive technologies in an industry already devastated by the effects of China’s market distorting policies, and creating serious risk that sensitive technologies and know-how will be transferred to China, further imperiling US defense interests,” the senators wrote. The DailyBrief Must-reads from across Asia - directly to your inbox The deal, announced just over two months ago, would give one of the world’s largest makers of extruded aluminum products access to US technology and customers that include Boeing Co and other US defense contractors and automakers that are increasingly turning to aluminum. The letter was signed by Republican Rob Portman of Ohio, where Aleris is based, and Democrats Ron Wyden, Charles Schumer, Bob Casey, Joe Manchin, Kirsten Gillibrand, Joe Donnelly, Debbie Stabenow, Jeff Merkley, Amy Klobuchar, Tammy Baldwin and Al Franken. They said the review committee needed to be cautious about the potential for sensitive research data to be transferred to China, including data with military applications such as advanced modeling techniques, high-strength alloys and the design of light armor material. A Zhongwang spokeswoman said the CFIUS filing for the transaction was voluntary and that the company and its US subsidiary have no connection with the Chinese government. She added that the deal will bring in additional resources and capital to Aleris and there will be no changes to management, employees or business strategies. A Treasury spokeswoman declined to comment on the letter, adding that information filed with CFIUS by law cannot be disclosed to the public and that Treasury does not comment on specific CFIUS cases. Aleris said in a statement reacting to the letter that the company’s US facilities produce no defense-related products, and the technology for aluminum plate used in some defense products was widely used in the industry. “Our facilities in the US produce aluminum for car and truck exteriors, gutters and roofing material,” Aleris said. ” Less than 1 percent of our sales go into defense applications, and none of those goods are produced in the US.”   Share Tweet Linkedin Email Business M&A US China Aluminum Metals Resources Comments More on this topic Government orders factories shut to reduce Beijing smog Lin Wanxia and Poo Yee Kai China companies find mixed profits in overseas M&A Lin Wanxia and Poo Yee Kai Shanghai Electric to pay US$1.77b for Pakistan’s K-Electric Reuters EVEN MORE asia times Facebook Twitter Google plus Linkedin asia times Facebook Twitter Google plus Linkedin Explore Main Business Politics Insights Culture China South Asia Trending Topics #Southeast Asia #Middle East #Japan #India #Koreas #South China Sea #Sport About About Asia Times Contact Us Advertise with Us Terms of Use Privacy The DailyBrief Must-reads from across Asia - directly to your inbox © 2016 Asia Times Holdings Limited, All Rights Reserved.
