Here's what $US110 billion dollars in nothing but the finest American weapons gets you these says. An American M1A2 tank. Photo credit: U.S. Army The U.S. State Department said in a written statement that the arms package "supports the long-term security of Saudi Arabia and the Gulf region in the face of malign Iranian influence and Iranian related threats." Besides protecting itself against Iran, the arms deal, which include tanks, helicopters, ships and other kinds of hardware will strengthen Riyadh's ability to protect itself, relieving U.S. forces of the burden to some degree. There is no official itemized list of arms connected to the $US110 billion sum, but it appears that Lockheed Martin, Boeing and Raytheon are the biggest beneficiaries. Lockheed Martin said in a statement that the Saudi Arabia will procure "more than $US28 billion worth of Lockheed Martin integrated air and missile defence, combat ship, tactical aircraft and rotary wing technologies and programs." Boeing and Raytheon also released statements, but did not specify how much money they expect to earn from the deal. A state department official forwarded Foxtrot Alpha this link of letters of offer and acceptance when we asked for details related to the arms deal. White House officials told The National Interest that details on the exact nature of what will be sold told the Saudis are still being ironed out, but it will likely be "a mix of direct commercial sales and foreign military sales contracts." Based on the memorandum of intent items outline in the link the State Department sent us, we itemized some of the big ticket items the Saudis are expecting. This is a partial list. Tanks An American M88A2 HERCULES. Photo credit: Mark Mauno Saudi Arabia is expecting 153 M1A1/A2 tank structures, which will be turned into 133 Saudi-specification M1A2S main battle tanks. Twenty additional tanks will replace those from the Saudis fleet that were lost in combat, possibly against Yemen. The tank sale also comes with M88A1/A2 Heavy Equipment Recovery Combat Utility Lift Evacuation System (HERCULES) — think of that like a tow truck for tanks — along with additional equipment, training, and support, according to the State Department. That tallies up to around $US1.5 billion. The M1A2 is an improvement on the M1A1, and a significant exterior change from the original includes the re-designed Commander's Weapon Station (CWS). Here's some of what's on the inside, per military.com: Most notable of these improvements is the addition of the Inter-Vehicle Information System (IVIS.) The IVIS system allows for the automatic and continual exchange of information between vehicles. By incorporating information provided by an on board Position/Navigation (POSNAV) system, unit commander's can track the location and progress of subordinate elements automatically, without tasking vehicle crews. In addition enemy positions can be identified, plotted and disseminated, while reports and artillery requests can be automatically formatted, transmitted, and processed. Lastly, map graphic control measures and operational orders can be rapidly distributed via the IVIS system. The M1A2 is arguably one of the the most sophisticated tanks the world, and it's much more advanced than Iran's Karrar, that's for sure. HERCULES is an armoured recovery vehicle (ARV) designed to evacuate, recover, repair tanks on the battlefield. They are equipped with a .50 calibre machine gun, with 1,300 rounds. The ARV can also take small arms fire, anti-personnel mines and artillery fragments. It has a 35-ton boom, and a 63,503kg constant-pull main winch, making it more than capable of pulling an M1A2S. And because nothing in life is complete without optional extras, it also comes with: One hundred fifty-three (153) M2 .50 Calibre Machine Guns; two hundred sixty-six (266) 7.62mm M240 Machine Guns; one hundred thirty-three (153) M250 Smoke Grenade Launchers; twenty (20) M88A l/A2 Heavy Equipment Recovery Combat Utility Lift Evacuation System (HERCULES) Armoured Recovery Vehicle (ARV) Structures for conversion to twenty (20) M88Al/A2 HERCULES ARVs; one hundred sixty-nine (169) AN/VAS-5 Driver Vision Enhancer-Abrams (DVE-A); one hundred thirty-three (133) AN/PVS-7B Night Vision Devices; four thousand two hundred fifty-six (4,256) Rounds M865 Training Ammunition; and two thousand three hundred ninety-four (2,394) Rounds M831Al Training Ammunition﻿ We know, all of this stuff has been on your birthday wishlist, too. Maybe next year. Helicopters A CH-47 Chinook. Photo credit: U.S. Department of Defence Riyadh will get around 48 CH-47F Chinook cargo helicopters, along with 112 Lycoming T55-GA-714A engines that the Chinooks use, 58 AN/AAR-57 Common Missile Warning Systems, and 48 M240H 7.62mm machine guns with spare parts and other hardware, totaling $US3.51 billion. In addition to the CH-47F Chinook being able to carry 33 troops plus three crew, with a maximum gross weight of 22,680kg and maximum cruise speed of 160 knots, here is more on the the chopper: The CH-47F Chinook is the Army's only heavy-lift cargo helicopter supporting combat and other critical operations. The CH-47F has a suite of improved features such as an upgraded digital cockpit featuring the Common Avionics Architecture System, a new monolithic airframe with vibration reduction, and the Digital Automatic Flight Control System, which provides coupled controllability for operations in adverse environments (reduced visibility, brown out, high winds). The CH-47F's common cockpit enables multiservice digital compatibility and interoperability for improved situational awareness, mission performance and survivability, as well as future growth potential. The CH-47F can lift intra-theatre payloads up to 16,000 pounds in high/hot environments. And even though it's one of the largest helicopters Saudi use, the Chinook is also one of the fastest. That's what you get when you have two main rotors. THAAD Perhaps the most controversial missile defence system in the world, Terminal High Altitude Area Defence, or THAAD, will be sold to Saudi Arabia, per The National Interest. Foxtrot Alpha has written extensively on THAAD, particularly its deployment to South Korea to protect the nation from a potential strike from North Korea. South Korea's New Missile Defence System Won't Keep It Safe The U.S. recently deployed the Terminal High-Altitude Area Defence (THAAD) system to South Korea to … Read more It is able to intercept short, medium, and intermediate range ballistic missiles in their terminal phase, and as such makes it highly attractive to a country like Saudi Arabia, which is situated in a part of the world where missiles seem to start flying on the regular. Though there are plenty of critiques about the system, it is highly advanced and would be a powerful addition to Saudi Arabia's ballistic missile defence. Ships The USS Freedom, an American Littoral Combat Ship. Photo credit: U.S. Navy The Saudis may be getting some "Multi-Mission Surface Combatants," or MMSC ships, which are based on the Freedom-class Littorial Combat Ship primarily built by Lockheed Martin. It has a nautical range of 8,047km and can go as far as 30 knots per hour. Here is more on the ship: The MMSC utilises the COMBATSS-21 Combat Management System, built from the Aegis Combat System Software library. The MMSC integrated combat system solution leverages the domestic LCS integration of the 57mm Mk110 deck gun and SeaRAM, and expands multi-mission capability through integration of Over-The-Horizon surface-to-surface missiles, port and starboard 20 mm remote guns, a new fire control radar and a forward centerline 8 cell MK 41 Vertical Launch System equipped with RIM-162 Evolved Sea Sparrow Missiles. The MMSC is also equipped with the AN/SLQ-25 Torpedo Defence system. Additionally, the deal also includes job training for Saudi citizens and infrastructure improvements. General Electric "signed memorandums of understanding for the sale of $US7 billion of GE technology and for the training of Saudi citizens in cloud-based data skills and expertise in the health-care industry," per The Washington Post. There are some more details to consider here. For one, many of these requests from the Saudis took place over several years before Trump won office in November, so it is not as if he brokered all of these deals between the various companies at once over several days or even during his total time in office. But it's not like this will truly change the balance of power in the Middle East. Sure, it seems like a massive arms deal, but truth be told Saudi Arabia — and for what it's worth, much of the entire region — has been backed by Western weapons for decades. All of this just makes sure that the wheel doesn't stop turning, and Saudi Arabia knows where its next gun is coming from.

State-run Chinese manufacturer Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China and Russia's United Aircraft Corporation said they formally launched an ambitious project to jointly develop a long-haul jet to challenge Boeing and Airbus Photo: POOL/AFP business China, Russia launch long-haul challenge to Boeing, Airbus Today 05:40 am JST 1 Comment By Dan Martin SHANGHAI China and Russia on Monday launched an ambitious project to jointly develop a long-haul jet to challenge Boeing and Airbus, just two weeks after the successful test flight of the first made-in-China large passenger plane. State-run Chinese manufacturer Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC) and Russia's United Aircraft Corporation (UAC) said they formally established the previously announced joint venture in Shanghai on Monday. Plans for the wide-body jet were first unveiled last June when visiting Russian President Vladimir Putin met China's Xi Jinping in Beijing, and Chinese state media have previously quoted officials saying the project could be worth between $13 billion and $20 billion. "The establishment of the joint-venture company symbolises the important progress made in the China-Russia long-range wide-body passenger aircraft project," COMAC chairman Jin Zhuanglong said in a statement. "We will cooperate sincerely with UAC, unite as one, and strive to make the .... project a model of Sino-Russian cooperation." China had already logged a key milestone in the country's ambitious journey to compete with the world's leading aircraft makers in early May with the test flight in Shanghai of COMAC's narrow-body C919 jet. The 168-seat C919, built for shorter regional routes, represents nearly a decade of effort in a government-mandated drive to reduce dependence on European consortium Airbus and US aerospace giant Boeing. Airbus and Boeing dominate China's market for passenger jets, which is growing in leaps and bounds as travel demand by Chinese consumers skyrockets. Aviation analysts, while acknowledging the C919 as a technical milestone for China, have warned that it faces a tough task challenging against Boeing and Airbus, with their deep market penetration and long history of performance. But with the China-Russia jet, which Chinese media reports say will be called the 929, Beijing will have the benefit of working with UAC, parent of passenger-jet manufacturer Sukhoi and other established Russian aviation brands. COMAC's statement said the aircraft will be able to seat 280 passengers and have a range of 12,000 kilometers. That would put it in direct competition with Boeing’s 787 and the Airbus A350. China's state-run Global Times newspaper late last year quoted UAC president Yury Slyusar as saying the project would be worth between $13 billion and $20 billion, with each side contributing half. In Monday's joint statement, Slyusar said the project is "testimony to China and Russia's determination to engage in long-term cooperation". COMAC said last year the planned jet could take its first flight in seven years, with deliveries beginning three years after that. Previous Chinese aerospace projects have suffered lengthy delays. China is expected to become the world's largest aviation market within several years, and President Xi has stressed the importance of Chinese-made jets handling much of that growing traffic. Airbus has estimated China will need nearly 6,000 new planes worth $945 billion in the next two decades, with Boeing's forecast even more optimistic at more than $1 trillion. © 2017 AFP Great tours and adventures in Asia's four season playground Choose from hand-picked tours throughout Japan with professional guides in amazing destinations.

It is probably a good thing to have competition, and it fits their diplomatic strategies to launch and support this. But it will take heavy investment in a mature industry. They could lose their shirts. You know, everyone paints the Chinese as these titans of commerce, but they have made a lot of dodgy investments that they might have to eat someday.

Iran has a history of supplying terrorists with advanced weaponry on commercial airplanes and the U.S. government must not allow Boeing to sell aircraft to Iran. Iran regularly uses commercial aircraft to transfer advanced weapons to the Syrian regime in support of the brutal Syrian civil war that has left approximately half a million dead. Iran also arms Hizb’allah with weapons and missiles via commercial aircraft. Despite this, Boeing chooses to callously and treacherously turn a blind eye to the usage of Boeing aircraft in the service of terrorists who threaten U.S. national security and that of key allies such as Israel. Hizb’allah is a terrorist proxy army of Iran responsible for the 1983 Beirut barracks bombings that claimed the lives of 305 people, including 241 U.S. peacekeepers. Hizb’allah was also responsible for starting the 2006 Lebanon War against Israel. Boeing may argue that pursuant to the Iran nuclear deal (aka the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action or JCPOA) it’s perfectly legal to sign aircraft contracts with Iranian airlines not currently sanctioned. They may note that the Boeing deals with Iranian airlines would support close to 118,000 U.S. jobs and offer an important boost to the economy. The Boeing deals made to date would provide up to 140 American-made aircraft. They include a December 2016 contract with Iran Air valued at $16.6 billion for the purchase of eighty new aircraft, including fifty 737 MAX 8s and thirty 777s and an April 2017 Boeing contract with Aseman Airlines valued at $3 billion for the sale of thirty 737 MAX airplanes (with an option for an additional thirty, allowing for a $6 billion cost for sixty aircraft). Iran has said that it negotiated with Boeing to pay only about $8 billion for the Iran Air contract. In addition, Aseman Airlines would also likely only pay approximately half of the announced contract amount. In 2011, the U.S.Treasury Depeartment sanctioned Iran Air for its employment by Iran’s Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and Ministry of Defense and Armed Forces Logistics (MODAFL) for its transport of “military related equipment.” On January 16, 2016, pursuant to the Iran nuclear deal, Iran Air was officially delisted from the Treasury Department’s list of sanctioned entities. While it may seem to the casual observer that Iran Air has ceased support for terrorism and the Syrian regime since being delisted from sanctions, that could not be farther from the truth. In congressional testimony, Dr. Emanuele Ottolenghi of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies testified that from Implementation Day of the Iran nuclear deal on January 16, 2016 through March 30, 2017, 690 commercial flights participated in airlifts from Iran to Syria. Half of those flights (345) were flown by Iran Air (114) and Mahan Air (231). These airlines undoubtedly ferry weapons and fighters to support the Syrian dictatorship and terrorist organizations such as Hezbollah. While Mahan Air is still under U.S. sanctions, the state-owned Iran Air is fully capable of transferring aircraft to Mahan Air. There are currently only thirty-four aircraft in the Iran Air fleet, two of which were delivered this year by Airbus. Overall, Iran plans to add approximately 500 airplanes to its commercial fleet of about 251 aircraft, effectively tripling its commercial air fleet. While this would improve the safety of Iranian air travel, it would come at the steep cost of substantially advancing the capability of Iran to quickly arm Hizb’allah with advanced weapons that would threaten Israel and the region. Dr. Ottolenghi notes that Iran Air, with its dramatically expanded air fleet, would likely act as a front for other Iranian airlines that support the Syrian regime and Hizb’allah. On July 12, 2016, Israeli ambassador to the UN Danny Danon revealed that Hizb’allah has 120,000 missiles aimed at Israel -– a whopping seventeen times the number of missiles it possessed just a decade earlier during the 2006 Lebanon War, estimated at 7,000! Then, in November Danon informed UN Security Council members that “The Iranian Al-Quds Force packs weapons, ammunition and missile technology to Hezbollah in suitcases and puts them on Mahan Air flights,” adding that “these planes fly directly to the airport in Lebanon or Damascus and from there the weapons are transferred on the ground to Hezbollah.” Boeing’s focus on achieving lucrative deals with Iranian airlines that could net them upwards of $10 billion to $20 billion dollars (depending on final amount agreed by the parties) potentially comes at the expense of the lives and the well-being of an untold number of innocent civilians suffering the ravages of the Syrian civil war. In addition, the very real threat to life and limb of millions of Israelis posed by a strengthened Hizb’allah terrorist organization are all too clear. In an April 10, 2017 letter to President Trump, Senator Marco Rubio and Congressman Peter Roskam urged a stop to the Boeing deal, stating: …Iran Air, Mahan Air, and other privately and publicly-owned Iranian commercial airlines use commercial aircraft to transport weapons, troops, and other tools of war to rogue regimes like the Syrian dictatorship of Bashar al-Assad, terrorist groups like Hezbollah, Hamas, and Islamic Jihad, and militant groups like the Houthi rebels in Yemen… Compelling evidence indicates that commercial Iranian airliners remain pivotal in delivering military support to terrorist groups and dictatorships around the Middle East. By supporting these terrorist groups and rogue regimes, Iran’s commercial airlines have American blood on their hands… The U.S. Treasury Department outlined Iran Air’s support of terrorism and terrorist-related activities in its 2011 press release announcing sanctions, as follows: Iran Air has provided support and services to MODAFL and the IRGC through the transport and/or transfer of goods for, or on behalf of, these entities. On numerous occasions since 2000, Iran Air shipped military-related electronic parts and mechanical equipment on behalf of MODAFL… Iran Air has shipped military-related equipment on behalf of the IRGC since 2006, and in September and November 2008, Iran Air shipped aircraft-related raw materials to a MODAFL-associated company, including titanium sheets, which have dual-use military applications and can be used in support of advanced weapons programs. Rockets or missiles have been transported via Iran Air passenger aircraft, and IRGC officers occasionally take control over Iran Air flights carrying special IRGC-related cargo. The IRGC is also known to disguise and manifest such shipments as medicine and generic spare parts, and IRGC officers have discouraged Iran Air pilots from inspecting potentially dangerous IRGC-related cargo being carried aboard a commercial Iran Air aircraft, including to Syria. Additionally, commercial Iran Air flights have also been used to transport missile or rocket components to Syria. At best, the tunnel vision, or at worst, the careless indifference to the potential loss of life of so many by these Boeing-Iran deals indicate that Boeing is acting in bad faith with the American people and with U.S. National Security. Such contracts threaten the safety and security of not only American allies such as Israel, but of the United States itself. Therefore, the U.S. Congress and President Trump must put an immediate stop to the Boeing aircraft sales to Iran. In recent months Boeing has signed contracts with Iranian airlines for the sale of over 100 state-of-the-art aircraft. Iran has a history of supplying terrorists with advanced weaponry on commercial airplanes and the U.S. government must not allow Boeing to sell aircraft to Iran.

In 2011, the U.S.Treasury Depeartment sanctioned Iran Air for its employment by Iran’s Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and Ministry of Defense and Armed Forces Logistics (MODAFL) for its transport of “military related equipment.” On January 16, 2016, pursuant to the Iran nuclear deal, Iran Air was officially delisted from the Treasury Department’s list of sanctioned entities. While it may seem to the casual observer that Iran Air has ceased support for terrorism and the Syrian regime since being delisted from sanctions, that could not be farther from the truth. In congressional testimony, Dr. Emanuele Ottolenghi of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies testified that from Implementation Day of the Iran nuclear deal on January 16, 2016 through March 30, 2017, 690 commercial flights participated in airlifts from Iran to Syria. Half of those flights (345) were flown by Iran Air (114) and Mahan Air (231). These airlines undoubtedly ferry weapons and fighters to support the Syrian dictatorship and terrorist organizations such as Hezbollah. While Mahan Air is still under U.S. sanctions, the state-owned Iran Air is fully capable of transferring aircraft to Mahan Air. There are currently only thirty-four aircraft in the Iran Air fleet, two of which were delivered this year by Airbus. Overall, Iran plans to add approximately 500 airplanes to its commercial fleet of about 251 aircraft, effectively tripling its commercial air fleet. While this would improve the safety of Iranian air travel, it would come at the steep cost of substantially advancing the capability of Iran to quickly arm Hizb’allah with advanced weapons that would threaten Israel and the region. Dr. Ottolenghi notes that Iran Air, with its dramatically expanded air fleet, would likely act as a front for other Iranian airlines that support the Syrian regime and Hizb’allah. On July 12, 2016, Israeli ambassador to the UN Danny Danon revealed that Hizb’allah has 120,000 missiles aimed at Israel -– a whopping seventeen times the number of missiles it possessed just a decade earlier during the 2006 Lebanon War, estimated at 7,000! Then, in November Danon informed UN Security Council members that “The Iranian Al-Quds Force packs weapons, ammunition and missile technology to Hezbollah in suitcases and puts them on Mahan Air flights,” adding that “these planes fly directly to the airport in Lebanon or Damascus and from there the weapons are transferred on the ground to Hezbollah.” Boeing’s focus on achieving lucrative deals with Iranian airlines that could net them upwards of $10 billion to $20 billion dollars (depending on final amount agreed by the parties) potentially comes at the expense of the lives and the well-being of an untold number of innocent civilians suffering the ravages of the Syrian civil war. In addition, the very real threat to life and limb of millions of Israelis posed by a strengthened Hizb’allah terrorist organization are all too clear. In an April 10, 2017 letter to President Trump, Senator Marco Rubio and Congressman Peter Roskam urged a stop to the Boeing deal, stating: …Iran Air, Mahan Air, and other privately and publicly-owned Iranian commercial airlines use commercial aircraft to transport weapons, troops, and other tools of war to rogue regimes like the Syrian dictatorship of Bashar al-Assad, terrorist groups like Hezbollah, Hamas, and Islamic Jihad, and militant groups like the Houthi rebels in Yemen… Compelling evidence indicates that commercial Iranian airliners remain pivotal in delivering military support to terrorist groups and dictatorships around the Middle East. By supporting these terrorist groups and rogue regimes, Iran’s commercial airlines have American blood on their hands… The U.S. Treasury Department outlined Iran Air’s support of terrorism and terrorist-related activities in its 2011 press release announcing sanctions, as follows: Iran Air has provided support and services to MODAFL and the IRGC through the transport and/or transfer of goods for, or on behalf of, these entities. On numerous occasions since 2000, Iran Air shipped military-related electronic parts and mechanical equipment on behalf of MODAFL… Iran Air has shipped military-related equipment on behalf of the IRGC since 2006, and in September and November 2008, Iran Air shipped aircraft-related raw materials to a MODAFL-associated company, including titanium sheets, which have dual-use military applications and can be used in support of advanced weapons programs. Rockets or missiles have been transported via Iran Air passenger aircraft, and IRGC officers occasionally take control over Iran Air flights carrying special IRGC-related cargo. The IRGC is also known to disguise and manifest such shipments as medicine and generic spare parts, and IRGC officers have discouraged Iran Air pilots from inspecting potentially dangerous IRGC-related cargo being carried aboard a commercial Iran Air aircraft, including to Syria. Additionally, commercial Iran Air flights have also been used to transport missile or rocket components to Syria. At best, the tunnel vision, or at worst, the careless indifference to the potential loss of life of so many by these Boeing-Iran deals indicate that Boeing is acting in bad faith with the American people and with U.S. National Security. Such contracts threaten the safety and security of not only American allies such as Israel, but of the United States itself. Therefore, the U.S. Congress and President Trump must put an immediate stop to the Boeing aircraft sales to Iran.

The Department of the Navy’s (DON) strike fighter squadrons are in a dire situation where—at least at last report during Congressional testimony on Feb.7, 2017—more than 62 percent of the service’s fighters are for all intents and purposes grounded. Of that total, the Marine Corps’ strike fighter fleet—which is composed mostly of older original model F/A-18A/B/C/D Hornets—is in even worse shape with as many as 74 percent of its jets not ready for war. The DON is taking steps to resolve the problem, which is the cumulative result of years of overuse and funding disruptions that stem from the 2011 Budget Control Act. Additionally, in the case of the Marine Corps, the service made some very poor decisions on aircraft procurement—betting its future on the on-time arrival of the Lockheed Martin F-35B Joint Strike Fighter. The solution to the problem is to increase the purchase of spare parts and push aircraft through depot maintenance faster. This new $238 million contract extension with Boeing to upgrade additional F/A-18s for the Navy and Marine Corps is part of that overall effort. The company’s Cecil Field facility will perform high flight-hour inspections, periodic maintenance inspections, in-service repair and modifications, upgrades and other engineering work for the aircraft. “Our mission is to support the Navy’s effort to improve readiness,” Travis McBurnett, Boeing’s F/A-18 Sustainment program director, said in a statement. “Since 1999, the Boeing Cecil Field team has returned 880 modified or repaired F/A-18s to the Navy and Marines. We look forward to delivering many more in the coming years.” However, even in the best-case scenario, it will take the DON—both the Navy and Marine Corps—years to recover from this debacle. That’s assuming stable funding without periodic disruptions as a result various continuing resolutions that are increasingly common as Congress routinely fails to pass budgets year after year. It’s not like this is a new problem—I’ve reported on this issue since before 2014 for The Daily Beast. If anything, matters have gotten worse year over year. At the end of the day, repairing old aircraft is not a long-term solution. Aircraft have limited airframe life—which should be viewed as a consumable. A brand new F/A-18F coming off the production line in St. Louis, Missouri, has a fatigue life of 6000-hours. That airframe life can be extended, but it is not indefinite. At some point, a new aircraft will be needed. Thus, the Navy—or any other aircraft operator—has to continually buy new aircraft to maintain its force strength as airframe life is consumed. The only real long-term solution to naval aviation readiness problems is to buy new aircraft. It doesn’t really matter if those jets are F/A-18s or F-35Cs—the service just needs more planes if it wants to have more flyable aircraft available. The ideal solution would be to ramp up production of the Super Hornet and F-35C immediately and to accelerate the development of the Next Generation Air Dominance (F/A-XX) as soon as possible. It’s just a matter of increased and—more importantly—stable funding for the naval aviation. The question is if Congress has the political will to provide that money.

Business Home LBoard IT company says employee’s tax paid, arrest warrant withdrawn Vanesha Shurentheran Read More FMT BAHASA FMT BORNEO+ FMT VIDEO CONTRIBUTE NEWS HOME NATION OPINION WORLD LEISURE SPORTS BUSINESS ADVERTISE WITH US In Bombardier fight, Boeing sees ghost of Airbus ascent Reuters | May 23, 2017 Some analysts say Boeing carelessly put at risk billions of dollars of defense work or pandered to growing protectionism. PARIS/SEATTLE: Two words underpin Boeing’s  decision to launch a U.S. trade complaint against Bombardier, which plunged it into a row with Canada last week: “Never again”. Allegations that the Canadian firm dumped newly designed CSeries passenger jets in the United States at a steep loss have threatened a sale of F/A-18 warplanes to Ottawa, sending Boeing scrambling to save the deal. Some analysts say Boeing carelessly put at risk billions of dollars of defense work or pandered to growing protectionism. But decades after Boeing failed to prevent European upstart Airbus gaining momentum with early victories in the United States, people familiar with the company say the strategic importance of defending its core passenger jet business outweighs the diplomatic storm. U.S. industry experts say Boeing and other jetmakers at the time did not take the European consortium seriously enough and allowed their future nemesis to poach U.S. airlines from 1978. Again after the September 2001 attacks in the United States, when Boeing slashed production, Airbus filled the vacuum, building up market share and never looking back. For years Boeing insiders have rued that decision, even while battling Airbus at the World Trade Organization (WTO) over mutual accusations of unfair subsidies. While leading in widebody jets, it has seen the narrowbody market – where the industry makes most cash – slip away as Airbus grabbed some 60 percent of new-generation sales. Such a significant imbalance in market share poses serious long-term risk to the loser in the Airbus-Boeing duopoly, because it creates a gap in costs that can’t easily be bridged. Now, Boeing sees a second rival entering its domestic market with what it sees as low prices and is determined not to underestimate the threat again, people close to the company say. “It’s a crucial entry market,” said a person familiar with Boeing’s strategy in taking on Bombardier. “This is the case Boeing might have brought against Airbus 40 years ago. Not taking action at the start led to consequences.” On the surface, Boeing’s case is about the sale of jets to Delta Air Lines at what Boeing claims were unfairly low prices. Bombardier denies Boeing’s estimates of both the price and the cost at which it is able to make its new jet, while critics say Boeing accounting rules allow it to disguise weak pricing. While the high-profile deal ignited Boeing’s complaint, executives say Boeing’s stance reflects a longer-term concern. Although Bombardier’s small narrowbody jet has so far barely scratched Boeing’s larger 737 and has suffered a spate of financial problems, the all-new design disturbs a landscape made up mainly by makeovers of existing Airbus and Boeing models. With Airbus still well ahead on narrowbody orders even after a recent lull, Boeing can ill afford to be squeezed on two fronts. Even less so with new players like China arriving. A Boeing spokesman declined to comment. Precision trade weapon  Boeing’s response marries strategic worries about its narrowbody position with a legal tactic designed to exploit a vulnerability the CSeries has, but global rival Airbus did not. The 110-130 seat CSeries relies mainly for now on the regional jet market, where North America is by far the largest single component and whose airlines therefore decide its future. That hands Boeing the opportunity to make use of a domestic lawsuit ill-suited to its global confrontation with Airbus, but which if successful could deliver a hammer blow to the CSeries. Trade sources see a second tactical motive for spurning the WTO and filing the industry’s first such domestic U.S. case. U.S. anti-dumping cases typically take a year – versus 13 years and counting in its trench warfare against Airbus. That coincides with first delivery of a CSeries to Delta in April 2018. If Boeing succeeds, the jets could be hit from day one with extra duties, blunting Bombardier’s competitiveness more quickly and more directly than normal trade sanctions. Still, Boeing faces a headache over what to do about lost fighter sales if Canada makes good on a threat to drop a deal for F/A-18 warplanes in retaliation for Boeing’s trade claim. With Boeing’s future fighter production in jeopardy as sales run dry, Boeing is anxious to keep its presence in that business long enough to compete for tomorrow’s military programs. But without stability in its narrowbody jetliner business, Boeing faces an even deeper concern, since this is the cash cow for many of the company’s other activities. Sources says Boeing’s defense bosses signed off on bringing the trade case, highlighting the importance attached to the 737. The broader stakes raised by Bombardier’s foray into the U.S. market were underscored when China was reported to revive on-off talks to invest in Bombardier. Airbus itself weighed buying the CSeries before talks collapsed in 2015. Whoever wins the trade spat between Bombardier and Boeing, one thing is clear: the small jet from Montreal has made its mark on the strategic calculations of all industry rivals, and now faces a battle for new sales.

The company said Wednesday that it still plans to deliver the first Boeing 737 Max later this month, and production will continue. A Boeing 737 MAX 9 under construction at the company's production facility in Renton, Washington, on Feb. 13. Jason Redmond / Reuters file The news sent Boeing Co. shares down nearly 4 percent, although they recovered partly to close at $183.18, down $2.31, or 1.3 percent. Chicago-based Boeing was notified last week of a potential issue involving turbine engine discs produced by a supplier to engine maker CFM International. Boeing said it has not experienced any problems with the discs during more than 2,000 hours of testing. It poses no safety concerns for travelers because no airlines are yet flying the 737 Max but it could mean a costly disruption if the problem persists. Timely delivery is important to planemakers as they get most of the payment for a plane when it is handed to the buyer. The Max is designed to be a more fuel-efficient version of the workhorse 737, Boeing's most popular commercial plane. Malaysia's Malindo Air plans to take delivery of the first Max in a few days and begin using it for passenger flights before July. Dallas-based Southwest Airlines Co. expects to begin using the plane this fall. It said Boeing had not warned it of any delays to its delivery schedule. Related: China's 'Homegrown' Competitor to 737 Takes to the Skies American Airlines Group Inc., which has 100 737 MAX jets on order, declined to comment when contacted by Reuters. The discs in question are made by a supplier to CFM International, a joint venture of General Electric and France's Safran. GE spokeswoman Jamie Jewell declined to identify the supplier. She said GE and Safran will work with the supplier to find and correct any shortcomings in the manufacturing process while also turning to a backup supplier to keep production of engines on schedule.

Jason Redmond / AFP - Getty Images file In a written statement, Boeing said it will work with CFM "to understand the precise scope and root cause of the quality issue." New planes and parts go through extensive testing to turn up problems before passengers go on board. Cai von Rumohr, an analyst with Cowen and Co., said "this doesn't look like a serious concern" because Boeing still expects to deliver the first plane this month and it appears to be a fixable manufacturing problem rather than a design flaw. Boeing has built about 9,500 single-aisle 737s since the late 1960s. The company said it has taken more than 3,700 orders for the Max, which carries a list price of $112.4 million to $119.2 million, although airlines routinely get big discounts.

 Boeing is taking extreme measures to make sure Bombardier does not become another Airbus Tim Hepher and Alwyn Scott, Reuters May 22, 2017, 6:01 PM 6,143 facebook linkedin twitter email print Boeing 737MAX.Boeing Two words underpin Boeing's decision to launch a U.S. trade complaint against Bombardier, which plunged it into a row with Canada last week: "Never again". Allegations that the Canadian firm dumped newly designed CSeries passenger jets in the United States at a steep loss have threatened a sale of F/A-18 warplanes to Ottawa, sending Boeing scrambling to save the deal. Some analysts say Boeing carelessly put at risk billions of dollars of defense work or pandered to growing protectionism. But decades after Boeing failed to prevent European upstart Airbus gaining momentum with early victories in the United States, people familiar with the company say the strategic importance of defending its core passenger jet business outweighs the diplomatic storm. U.S. industry experts say Boeing and other jetmakers at the time did not take the European consortium seriously enough and allowed their future nemesis to poach U.S. airlines from 1978. Again after the September 2001 attacks in the United States, when Boeing slashed production, Airbus filled the vacuum, building up market share and never looking back. For years Boeing insiders have rued that decision, even while battling Airbus at the World Trade Organization (WTO) over mutual accusations of unfair subsidies. While leading in widebody jets, it has seen the narrowbody market – where the industry makes most cash - slip away as Airbus grabbed some 60 percent of new-generation sales. Airbus Mobile, Alabama assembly plant.REUTERS/Michael Spooneybarger Such a significant imbalance in market share poses serious long-term risk to the loser in the Airbus-Boeing duopoly, because it creates a gap in costs that can't easily be bridged. Now, Boeing sees a second rival entering its domestic market with what it sees as low prices and is determined not to underestimate the threat again, people close to the company say. "It's a crucial entry market," said a person familiar with Boeing's strategy in taking on Bombardier. "This is the case Boeing might have brought against Airbus 40 years ago. Not taking action at the start led to consequences." On the surface, Boeing's case is about the sale of jets to Delta Air Lines at what Boeing claims were unfairly low prices. Bombardier denies Boeing's estimates of both the price and the cost at which it is able to make its new jet, while critics say Boeing accounting rules allow it to disguise weak pricing. Delta Air Lines Bombardier CS100.Bombardier While the high-profile deal ignited Boeing's complaint, executives say Boeing's stance reflects a longer-term concern. Although Bombardier's small narrowbody jet has so far barely scratched Boeing's larger 737 and has suffered a spate of financial problems, the all-new design disturbs a landscape made up mainly by makeovers of existing Airbus and Boeing models. With Airbus still well ahead on narrowbody orders even after a recent lull, Boeing can ill afford to be squeezed on two fronts. Even less so with new players like China arriving. A Boeing spokesman declined to comment. Precision trade weapon Boeing's response marries strategic worries about its narrowbody position with a legal tactic designed to exploit a vulnerability the CSeries has, but global rival Airbus did not. The 110-130 seat CSeries relies mainly for now on the regional jet market, where North America is by far the largest single component and whose airlines, therefore, decide its future. That hands Boeing the opportunity to make use of a domestic lawsuit ill-suited to its global confrontation with Airbus, but which if successful could deliver a hammer blow to the CSeries. Trade sources see a second tactical motive for spurning the WTO and filing the industry's first such domestic U.S. case. U.S. anti-dumping cases typically take a year - versus 13 years and counting in its trench warfare against Airbus. American Airlines Airbus A319.American Airlines That coincides with the first delivery of a CSeries to Delta in April 2018. If Boeing succeeds, the jets could be hit from day one with extra duties, blunting Bombardier's competitiveness more quickly and more directly than normal trade sanctions. Still, Boeing faces a headache over what to do about lost fighter sales if Canada makes good on a threat to drop a deal for F/A-18 warplanes in retaliation for Boeing's trade claim. With Boeing's future fighter production in jeopardy as sales run dry, Boeing is anxious to keep its presence in that business long enough to compete for tomorrow's military programs. But without stability in its narrowbody jetliner business, Boeing faces an even deeper concern, since this is the cash cow for many of the company's other activities. SBoeing Sources say Boeing's defense bosses signed off on bringing the trade case, highlighting the importance attached to the 737. The broader stakes raised by Bombardier's foray into the U.S. market were underscored when China was reported to revive on-off talks to invest in Bombardier. Airbus itself weighed buying the CSeries before talks collapsed in 2015. Whoever wins the trade spat between Bombardier and Boeing, one thing is clear: the small jet from Montreal has made its mark on the strategic calculations of all industry rivals, and now faces a battle for new sales.

The plane was undergoing extensive maintenance at a Boeing facility in San Antonio, Texas, when the mishap occurred in April 2016. No one was injured. An Air Force accident investigation report released this month faulted three Boeing mechanics for supplying and using tools and parts that did not meet cleanliness standards while checking oxygen lines for leaks. The standards are meant to prevent a fire hazard. The mechanics also used an unauthorized cleaning procedure. The report said Boeing has paid more than $4 million to clean or replace contaminated portions of the aircraft's oxygen system. The plane has been returned to service with the 89th Airlift Wing at Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland. Get breaking news sent instantly to your inbox Sign Up!

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 22 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Boeing Taps ViaSat’s Small Tactical Terminal for the U.S. Marine Corps’ AV-8B Harrier Attack Aircraft Program CARLSBAD, Calif., May 22, 2017 /PRNewswire/ — ViaSat Inc. (NASDAQ: VSAT), a global broadband services and technology company, announced today it received a contract from The Boeing Company (NYSE: BA) to deliver its KOR-24A Small Tactical Terminals (STT) for integration onto Boeing’s AV-8B Harrier attack aircraft for United States Marine Corps (USMC) and international customers. The contract is worth approximately $20M including exercisable options. The STT was competitively selected as providing the best value to Boeing and its U.S. Government customer based upon its capability, product maturity and proven reliability as the only small form factor Link 16 and Soldier Radio Waveform (SRW) capable aviation terminal fielded in the world. The STT will enable the USMC’s Harriers to better coordinate their activities with other U.S. and allied aircraft as well as with U.S. and allied ground forces using both Link 16 and SRW networks in order to more rapidly engage enemy targets and to do so with reduced risk of fratricide or collateral damage. “Being selected by Boeing to provide the Link 16 radio for the AV-8B is another big milestone for us,” said Ken Peterman, president, Government Systems, ViaSat. “It is further evidence of the value of our STT product as well as our commercial approach to developing products to provide our warfighters with the capability they need to address their critical gaps with little or no investment necessary by the government customer.  This order from Boeing for the Harrier increases the quantities of STTs either in the field or on order to well over 1,200 units; and we anticipate a market with at least several thousand additional units to follow.” About ViaSat ViaSat, Inc. (NASDAQ:  VSAT ) keeps the world connected. As a global broadband services and technology company, ViaSat ensures consumers, businesses, governments and military personnel have communications access – anywhere – whether on the ground or in-flight. The Company’s innovations in designing highest-capacity satellites and secure ground infrastructure and terminal technologies coupled with its international network of managed Wi-Fi hotspots enable ViaSat to deliver a best available network that extends the reach and accessibility of broadband internet service, globally.

State-run Chinese manufacturer Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC) and Russia’s United Aircraft Corporation (UAC) said they formally established the previously announced joint venture in Shanghai on Monday. Plans for the wide-body jet were first unveiled last June when visiting Russian President Vladimir Putin met China’s Xi Jinping in Beijing, and Chinese state media have previously quoted officials saying the project could be worth between $13 billion and $20 billion. “The establishment of the joint-venture company symbolises the important progress made in the China-Russia long-range wide-body passenger aircraft project,” COMAC chairman Jin Zhuanglong said in a statement. “We will cooperate sincerely with UAC, unite as one, and strive to make the …. project a model of Sino-Russian cooperation.” China had already logged a key milestone in the country’s ambitious journey to compete with the world’s leading aircraft makers in early May with the test flight in Shanghai of COMAC’s narrow-body C919 jet. The 168-seat C919, built for shorter regional routes, represents nearly a decade of effort in a government-mandated drive to reduce dependence on European consortium Airbus and US aerospace giant Boeing. Airbus and Boeing dominate China’s market for passenger jets, which is growing in leaps and bounds as travel demand by Chinese consumers skyrockets. Aviation analysts, while acknowledging the C919 as a technical milestone for China, have warned that it faces a tough task challenging against Boeing and Airbus, with their deep market penetration and long history of performance. – Chinese travel takes off – But with the China-Russia jet, which Chinese media reports say will be called the 929, Beijing will have the benefit of working with UAC, parent of passenger-jet manufacturer Sukhoi and other established Russian aviation brands. COMAC’s statement said the aircraft will be able to seat 280 passengers and have a range of 12,000 kilometres (7,450 miles). That would put it in direct competition with Boeing´s 787 and the Airbus A350. China’s state-run Global Times newspaper late last year quoted UAC president Yury Slyusar as saying the project would be worth between $13 billion and $20 billion, with each side contributing half. In Monday’s joint statement, Slyusar said the project is “testimony to China and Russia’s determination to engage in long-term cooperation”. COMAC said last year the planned jet could take its first flight in seven years, with deliveries beginning three years after that. Previous Chinese aerospace projects have suffered lengthy delays. China is expected to become the world’s largest aviation market within several years, and President Xi has stressed the importance of Chinese-made jets handling much of that growing traffic. Airbus has estimated China will need nearly 6,000 new planes worth $945 billion in the next two decades, with Boeing’s forecast even more optimistic at more than $1 trillion.

By Ben Levisohn Updated May 22, 2017 12:04 p.m. ET Text Size Regular Medium Large The Bull-Bear battle over Boeing (BA) typically centers on the U.S. airplane manufacturer's cash flow versus the late innings of the business cycle. Barclays, however, contends it's time to focus on Boeing's margins. Illustration: Getty Images The Boeing bulls have certainly been winning this year, as its shares have climbed 17% in 2017. The bears won last week, however, as Boeing fell 1.4% even after the U.S. Commerce Department said it was prepared to investigate Canadian jet maker Bombardier for dumping. Barclays analyst Carter Copeland explains why Boeing's margins should be a focus for the bulls: The company makes the case that a margin story also underlays the longer-term outlook, but to date, we don’t think this view has gained much traction with bulls; in several cases, the presumed lack of achievability of margin targets has been a more frequent thread in the bear case. We continue to believe that Boeing (and Airbus for that matter) possesses significant margin expansion potential in the coming years based on the decision earlier this decade to pursue re-engined aircraft designs rather than clean-sheet models, but in BA’s case, we think investors have shown an unwillingness to believe in this view...Together with the deployment of sizable FCF through share repo and a still-attractive relative valuation, we think this points to further upside for BA shares, which still remain unpopular with many investors. Our PT moves to $200. Shares of Boeing have gained 1.2% to $182.83 at 12:02 p.m. today.

Allegations that the Canadian firm dumped newly designed CSeries passenger jets in the United States at a steep loss have threatened a sale of F/A-18 warplanes to Ottawa, sending Boeing scrambling to save the deal. Some analysts say Boeing carelessly put at risk billions of dollars of defence work or pandered to growing protectionism. But decades after Boeing failed to prevent European upstart Airbus gaining momentum with early victories in the United States, people familiar with the company say the strategic importance of defending its core passenger jet business outweighs the diplomatic storm. U.S. industry experts say Boeing and other jetmakers at the time did not take the European consortium seriously enough and allowed their future nemesis to poach U.S. airlines from 1978. Again after the September 2001 attacks in the United States, when Boeing slashed production, Airbus filled the vacuum, building up market share and never looking back. For years Boeing insiders have rued that decision, even while battling Airbus at the World Trade Organization (WTO) over mutual accusations of unfair subsidies. While leading in widebody jets, it has seen the narrowbody market - where the industry makes most cash - slip away as Airbus grabbed some 60 percent of new-generation sales. Such a significant imbalance in market share poses serious long-term risk to the loser in the Airbus-Boeing duopoly, because it creates a gap in costs that can't easily be bridged. Now, Boeing sees a second rival entering its domestic market with what it sees as low prices and is determined not to underestimate the threat again, people close to the company say. "It's a crucial entry market," said a person familiar with Boeing's strategy in taking on Bombardier. "This is the case Boeing might have brought against Airbus 40 years ago. Not taking action at the start led to consequences." On the surface, Boeing's case is about the sale of jets to Delta Air Lines at what Boeing claims were unfairly low prices. Bombardier denies Boeing's estimates of both the price and the cost at which it is able to make its new jet, while critics say Boeing accounting rules allow it to disguise weak pricing. While the high-profile deal ignited Boeing's complaint, executives say Boeing's stance reflects a longer-term concern. Although Bombardier's small narrowbody jet has so far barely scratched Boeing's larger 737 and has suffered a spate of financial problems, the all-new design disturbs a landscape made up mainly by makeovers of existing Airbus and Boeing models. With Airbus still well ahead on narrowbody orders even after a recent lull, Boeing can ill afford to be squeezed on two fronts. Even less so with new players like China arriving. A Boeing spokesman declined to comment. PRECISION TRADE WEAPON Boeing's response marries strategic worries about its narrowbody position with a legal tactic designed to exploit a vulnerability the CSeries has, but global rival Airbus did not. The 110-130 seat CSeries relies mainly for now on the regional jet market, where North America is by far the largest single component and whose airlines therefore decide its future. That hands Boeing the opportunity to make use of a domestic lawsuit ill-suited to its global confrontation with Airbus, but which if successful could deliver a hammer blow to the CSeries. Trade sources see a second tactical motive for spurning the WTO and filing the industry's first such domestic U.S. case. U.S. anti-dumping cases typically take a year - versus 13 years and counting in its trench warfare against Airbus. That coincides with first delivery of a CSeries to Delta in April 2018. If Boeing succeeds, the jets could be hit from day one with extra duties, blunting Bombardier's competitiveness more quickly and more directly than normal trade sanctions. Still, Boeing faces a headache over what to do about lost fighter sales if Canada makes good on a threat to drop a deal for F/A-18 warplanes in retaliation for Boeing's trade claim. With Boeing's future fighter production in jeopardy as sales run dry, Boeing is anxious to keep its presence in that business long enough to compete for tomorrow's military programmes. But without stability in its narrowbody jetliner business, Boeing faces an even deeper concern, since this is the cash cow for many of the company's other activities. Sources says Boeing's defence bosses signed off on bringing the trade case, highlighting the importance attached to the 737. The broader stakes raised by Bombardier's foray into the U.S. market were underscored when China was reported to revive on-off talks to invest in Bombardier. Airbus itself weighed buying the CSeries before talks collapsed in 2015. Whoever wins the trade spat between Bombardier and Boeing, one thing is clear: the small jet from Montreal has made its mark on the strategic calculations of all industry rivals, and now faces a battle for new sales.

Industry is working on new aircraft fuels that reduce greenhouse gas emissions By John Fialka, ClimateWire on May 22, 2017 Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Reddit Email Print Share via Google+ Stumble Upon Airlines account for about 2 percent of the world's greenhouse gas emissions. If the industry does not succeed in reducing its emissions, they are expected grow to 3 percent by 2050. Credit: NASA, SSAI, Edward Winstead Advertisement | Report Ad The first in a two-part series on advanced biofuels. In 2008, a group of airlines came to Boeing Co., the world’s largest aerospace company, with a big problem. At that point, the United States, under President Obama, was instituting policies to fight climate change. One of them involved cutting emissions from jet fuel. A year earlier, bipartisan support from Congress had given the new administration what seemed to be a powerful new tool to do it, a law calling for “advanced biofuels.” It promised to be a new category of fuels that would reduce greenhouse gas emissions by at least 50 percent compared with petroleum-based fuels. It was aimed at the transportation sector, second to only electricity generation as the biggest emitters of CO2. At the time, solar and wind power were already beginning to reduce power plant emissions, and the general assumption was that within 10 years the auto industry would begin to reduce its share of the transportation problem by producing electric cars. But the airlines worried that there was no way to use solar and wind to power commercial airplanes. Electric airliners weren’t on the drawing boards. “They said, ‘Hey, we need help. We can’t do this on our own.’ And we said, ‘Yep, we can do that,’” recalled Darrin Morgan, Boeing’s chief strategist for creating new aviation fuels. As a major U.S. exporter that has dealings with over 150 countries, Boeing had worked with airlines in the development of more fuel-efficient aircraft and better flying practices. Now it helped form and lead the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Users Group (SAFUG). It currently represents 27 airlines that consume one-third of the world’s jet fuel. This was a step completely outside the global reach of Boeing or the world’s airlines: New aircraft fuels that met greenhouse gas reduction targets had to be developed and tested to meet tough aircraft standards. They could not freeze and had to be powerful and safe enough to run standard jet engines and use existing fuel delivery systems. Another goal was that airline passengers would not sense any difference in performance. “We were trying to create a new industry that does not exist in the way we need it to exist,” explained Morgan, a former financial expert who was brought into Boeing because he was familiar with biofuels. Finding low-carbon biofuels that can meet the requirements of the airlines, environmental groups and governments has undergone a long, lumbering takeoff. But, he said, he sees it as a step that’s beginning to happen. Advice has come from many places. Environmental groups, worried about the sources of new fuels, rejected proposals to make biofuels out of trees. They were particularly worried about destruction of rainforests to create palm oil plantations. Social groups were unhappy about making advanced biofuels from food sources, such as corn, or on land used for food crops because a growing population will need more food. Boeing and other SAFUG members also worked with another group. The Roundtable on Sustainable Biomaterials (RSB) was formed to include representatives of environmental, farm and social groups as well as experts from companies that make aircraft and jet engines. The idea was to forge a consensus for one standard of sustainability, not dozens. “We sent a signal to the market very early that says we’re going to set a high bar. We said, ‘Folks, if you want to serve our industry, you need to meet that high bar,’” explained Morgan. Enter the Finnish pioneer There is a lot at stake in this. Airlines produce about 2 percent of the world’s greenhouse gases. If the industry does not succeed in reducing its emissions, they are expected to grow to 3 percent by 2050. In retrospect, Morgan thinks that the peculiarity of the airlines’ dilemma turned out to be an asset in drawing support for clear standards and new ideas. “That was the beauty of not having an incumbent industry. There was none for biofuels, so we could make it the way we wanted from the beginning.” Flight tests that followed showed that some of the most promising results came from Neste Corp., a company that was formed in 1948 as the state-owned petroleum company for Finland. In 2005, it became focused on a process that made diesel fuel using fatty acids and oily agricultural residues that included palm oil. There was a large market for cleaner fuels in Europe, and Neste soon dominated it, making diesel used for trucks and cars. After being attacked by Greenpeace and other environmental groups, Neste began to modify its process. It agreed to phase out the use of palm oil, which is used for a variety of foods, and rely mainly on non-edible vegetable and animal wastes and residues to make what the company calls a “hydrotreated vegetable oil,” a product that closely resembles kerosene. Working with Boeing and other members of the RSB, Neste came up with what is called a “drop-in” fuel that can be used in jet and turboprop engines. So far, according to Neville Fernandes, general manager for Neste in the United States, it has been successfully tested in 1,200 commercial flights. What makes Neste’s fuel different from other competitors in the race to develop a bio-jet fuel is that the company already operates two refineries that make biodiesel for it, so it can quickly scale up and produce much larger quantities of jet fuel that can, according to the company, cut an airliner’s greenhouse gas emissions from 40 to 90 percent. “It is definitely fair to say that Neste is a pioneer,” explained Boeing’s Morgan. “They took a big risk and deserve a lot of credit. They bet a large percentage of their company on the future of renewable fuels at a time when a lot of people were not making that bet.” The hurdle that remains is called ASTM International. It was formed in 1898 as the American Society for Testing and Materials, and its first decision was to approve the steel used for rails by the Pennsylvania Railroad. It has since become international and has offices around the world that help set health, quality and safety standards for over 12,000 products. Boeing and other aircraft and jet engine manufacturers have formed an ASTM committee to decide whether the fuel from the Neste process can be used globally for making low-carbon jet fuel. The end of “Biofuels 1.0” If ASTM approves, then the pool of renewable jet fuel will grow from a tiny 2 million gallons to a potential 2 billion gallons annually. That’s not nearly enough to fuel the entire global airline industry, but, as Morgan explains, “it’s really an important step because it gets us out of the experimental phase and gets industries into large quantities at cost-competitive prices.” An enlarging market, he hopes, will encourage more oil refiners and other companies to get into the business. It will also mark the end of what Morgan calls “Biofuels 1.0,” a risky period for governments, innovators and investors who assumed low-carbon jet fuels were a venture that would promptly take flight. Unlike Neste, several companies that have tried to make biofuels have crashed into bankruptcy. Others have made sudden shifts into products that don’t have to fly. One of these survivors is Cool Planet Energy Systems, a Greenwood Village, Colo., firm that made a splash in 2009 with a technology called pyrolysis that can heat farm wastes, wood chips and nutshells in the absence of oxygen to create fumes that are then passed through a catalyst to make a liquid biofuel. “You don’t have any further refining or upgrading processing. It’s a ready to use liquid fuel. You just have to blend it together,” explained Wes Bolsen, the head of business development for Cool Planet. The process also resulted in a dirtlike waste called char. According to Bolsen, the process attracted investments from three major oil companies and won a $91 million grant from the Department of Agriculture. The potential feedstocks to be used by the company to make renewable jet fuel seemed unlimited. “There are 42 million acres of beetle-killed trees in the northern Rockies. Those trees are going to fall down and rot and turn into methane, which is much worse than carbon dioxide,” he said, noting that by turning wood chips into biofuel, his company would actually be reducing greenhouse gases from the atmosphere. Cool Planet built a pilot plant that worked, but it never got to the point where it could begin selling a biofuel. Its investors balked at raising the hundreds of millions it needed to build the first commercial-sized facility. “The hardest thing to do is to get the first commercial-scale plant. It will be the most inefficient plant ever built because you’re going to learn from it,” explained Bolsen. To stay in business, the company quickly needed a product to sell, so it turned to the char, the waste left over from pyrolysis. The char was branded “Cool Terra,” which the company describes as “an engineered biocarbon designed to improve soil health.” It is a soil additive that Cool Planet now markets in 48 states. According to Bolsen, it has become popular with golf courses and nurseries that grow tomatoes and strawberries. Cool Planet says it has raised $30 million and is building a plant in Louisiana that is designed to produce the char. Bolsen explained that it may not be ready to carry out the company’s dream to produce a biofuel. “You’ve got to do this step-wise,” he said. Another survivor that managed a soft landing was Solazyme, a San Francisco startup that developed a biofuel from algae and sugar that seemed to hold promise until the company’s stock price began to crash last year. Then it transformed itself into a company called TerraVia Holdings Inc., which sells algae-based oil for cosmetics and food products. At least a half dozen companies followed the trajectory of KiOR, a high-flying Pasadena, Texas, company that took off in 2007, briefly enjoyed a valuation of $1.5 billion for its process to turn wood chips into biofuels, failed to live up to its production estimates, and then crashed into a messy bankruptcy in 2014. Then the attorney general of Mississippi—selected as the home of KiOR’s first commercial plant—called it “one of the largest frauds ever perpetrated on the state of Mississippi.” But others survived to meet the next challenge.

La Monica   @lamonicabuzz May 22, 2017: 1:18 PM ET Trump signs $110 billion arms deal with Saudi Arabia Several well-known American defense contractors got a big lift Monday thanks to new deals by the Saudi Arabian government to purchase weapons, ships, aircraft and other military equipment in the wake of President Trump's visit to the kingdom. Lockheed Martin (LMT) said on Saturday that Saudi Arabia was spending more than $28 billion on missiles, radar defense systems and 150 S-70 Black Hawk helicopters, among other things. Raytheon, Boeing and General Dynamics also announced deals with the Saudi government. Financial terms of those specific deals were not disclosed. But the White House said that Saudi Arabia would be spending $110 billion on defense contracts as part of a broader deal signed by Trump and Saudi King Salman during the visit. Shares of Lockheed, Raytheon (RTN), Boeing (BA) and General Dynamics (GD) all rose on Monday following the news. Raytheon, Lockheed and General Dynamics hit all-time highs in the process. So did defense company Northrop Grumman (NOC). Defense stocks have been skyrocketing for the past year, largely on the expectation that defense spending would continue to increase in the US even if there were federal budget cuts elsewhere. That was the case even when many on Wall Street thought that Hillary Clinton would be the next president. She was widely thought to be hawkish on military spending due to her record as a US Senator and former Secretary of State. But Trump's win has kicked the defense sector into an even higher gear. Boeing, which also makes commercial jetliners (and Air Force One) is up 18% this year, making it one of the top stocks in the Dow. Related: American oil companies deepen Saudi ties, despite rivalry Fellow Dow component United Technologies (UTX), whose Pratt & Whitney unit makes engines for many military planes is up more than 10% year-to-date, as are Raytheon, Lockheed and General Dynamics. Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst for Think Markets UK, believes that the defense sector will continue to shine. Aslam said Trump is likely to continue to push for more big defense contracts from foreign governments since that will allow him to tout job creation in the process. "The jobs market is his biggest baby," Aslam said. To that end, the White House noted in a blog post about the meeting with King Salman that the deal is "expanding opportunities for American companies in the region, potentially supporting tens of thousands of new jobs in the United States." And White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer lauded the deal in a tweet as the "largest single arms deal in US history." It's also no secret that Trump's proposed federal budget will be good for the defense sector as well. While Trump is expected to propose cuts to various domestic social safety net programs like food stamps and Medicare, the preliminary budget from March earmarked a $54 billion increase for spending at the Pentagon.

Photo: Reuters mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 12:45 AM, May 23, 2017 Updated: 1:00 AM, May 23, 2017 PARIS/SEATTLE - Two words underpin Boeing's <BA.N> decision to launch a U.S. trade complaint against Bombardier <BBDb.TO>, which plunged it into a row with Canada last week: "Never again". Allegations that the Canadian firm dumped newly designed CSeries passenger jets in the United States at a steep loss have threatened a sale of F/A-18 warplanes to Ottawa, sending Boeing scrambling to save the deal. Some analysts say Boeing carelessly put at risk billions of dollars of defense work or pandered to growing protectionism. But decades after Boeing failed to prevent European upstart Airbus gaining momentum with early victories in the United States, people familiar with the company say the strategic importance of defending its core passenger jet business outweighs the diplomatic storm. U.S. industry experts say Boeing and other jetmakers at the time did not take the European consortium seriously enough and allowed their future nemesis to poach U.S. airlines from 1978. Again after the September 2001 attacks in the United States, when Boeing slashed production, Airbus <AIR.PA> filled the vacuum, building up market share and never looking back. For years Boeing insiders have rued that decision, even while battling Airbus at the World Trade Organization (WTO) over mutual accusations of unfair subsidies. While leading in widebody jets, it has seen the narrowbody market – where the industry makes most cash - slip away as Airbus grabbed some 60 percent of new-generation sales. Such a significant imbalance in market share poses serious long-term risk to the loser in the Airbus-Boeing duopoly, because it creates a gap in costs that can't easily be bridged. Now, Boeing sees a second rival entering its domestic market with what it sees as low prices and is determined not to underestimate the threat again, people close to the company say. "It's a crucial entry market," said a person familiar with Boeing's strategy in taking on Bombardier. "This is the case Boeing might have brought against Airbus 40 years ago. Not taking action at the start led to consequences." On the surface, Boeing's case is about the sale of jets to Delta Air Lines at what Boeing claims were unfairly low prices. Bombardier denies Boeing's estimates of both the price and the cost at which it is able to make its new jet, while critics say Boeing accounting rules allow it to disguise weak pricing. While the high-profile deal ignited Boeing's complaint, executives say Boeing's stance reflects a longer-term concern. Although Bombardier's small narrowbody jet has so far barely scratched Boeing's larger 737 and has suffered a spate of financial problems, the all-new design disturbs a landscape made up mainly by makeovers of existing Airbus and Boeing models. With Airbus still well ahead on narrowbody orders even after a recent lull, Boeing can ill afford to be squeezed on two fronts. Even less so with new players like China arriving. A Boeing spokesman declined to comment. PRECISION TRADE WEAPON Boeing's response marries strategic worries about its narrowbody position with a legal tactic designed to exploit a vulnerability the CSeries has, but global rival Airbus did not. The 110-130 seat CSeries relies mainly for now on the regional jet market, where North America is by far the largest single component and whose airlines therefore decide its future. That hands Boeing the opportunity to make use of a domestic lawsuit ill-suited to its global confrontation with Airbus, but which if successful could deliver a hammer blow to the CSeries. Trade sources see a second tactical motive for spurning the WTO and filing the industry's first such domestic U.S. case. U.S. anti-dumping cases typically take a year - versus 13 years and counting in its trench warfare against Airbus. That coincides with first delivery of a CSeries to Delta in April 2018. If Boeing succeeds, the jets could be hit from day one with extra duties, blunting Bombardier's competitiveness more quickly and more directly than normal trade sanctions. Still, Boeing faces a headache over what to do about lost fighter sales if Canada makes good on a threat to drop a deal for F/A-18 warplanes in retaliation for Boeing's trade claim. With Boeing's future fighter production in jeopardy as sales run dry, Boeing is anxious to keep its presence in that business long enough to compete for tomorrow's military programs. But without stability in its narrowbody jetliner business, Boeing faces an even deeper concern, since this is the cash cow for many of the company's other activities. Sources says Boeing's defense bosses signed off on bringing the trade case, highlighting the importance attached to the 737. The broader stakes raised by Bombardier's foray into the U.S. market were underscored when China was reported to revive on-off talks to invest in Bombardier. Airbus itself weighed buying the CSeries before talks collapsed in 2015. Whoever wins the trade spat between Bombardier and Boeing, one thing is clear: the small jet from Montreal has made its mark on the strategic calculations of all industry rivals, and now faces a battle for new sales.

Lockheed Martin said on Saturday that Saudi Arabia was spending more than $28 billion on missiles, radar defense systems and 150 S-70 Black Hawk helicopters, among other things. Raytheon, Boeing and General Dynamics also announced deals with the Saudi government. Financial terms of those specific deals were not disclosed. But the White House said that Saudi Arabia would be spending $110 billion on defense contracts as part of a broader deal signed by Trump and Saudi King Salman during the visit. Shares of Lockheed, Raytheon, Boeing and General Dynamics all rose on Monday following the news. Raytheon, Lockheed and General Dynamics hit all-time highs in the process. So did defense company Northrop Grumman. Defense stocks have been skyrocketing for the past year, largely on the expectation that defense spending would continue to increase in the US even if there were federal budget cuts elsewhere. That was the case even when many on Wall Street thought that Hillary Clinton would be the next president. She was widely thought to be hawkish on military spending due to her record as a US Senator and former Secretary of State. But Trump’s win has kicked the defense sector into an even higher gear. Boeing, which also makes commercial jetliners (and Air Force One) is up 18% this year, making it one of the top stocks in the Dow. Fellow Dow component United Technologies, whose Pratt & Whitney unit makes engines for many military planes is up more than 10% year-to-date, as are Raytheon, Lockheed and General Dynamics. Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst for Think Markets UK, believes that the defense sector will continue to shine. Aslam said Trump is likely to continue to push for more big defense contracts from foreign governments since that will allow him to tout job creation in the process. “The jobs market is his biggest baby,” Aslam said. To that end, the White House noted in a blog post about the meeting with King Salman that the deal is “expanding opportunities for American companies in the region, potentially supporting tens of thousands of new jobs in the United States.” And White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer lauded the deal in a tweet as the “largest single arms deal in US history.” It’s also no secret that Trump’s proposed federal budget will be good for the defense sector as well. While Trump is expected to propose cuts to various domestic social safety net programs like food stamps and Medicare, the preliminary budget from March earmarked a $54 billion increase for spending at the Pentagon.

REUTERS/Christinne Muschi/File Photo 2/3 left right A logo of jet manufacturer Bombardier is pictured on their booth during the European Business Aviation Convention & Exhibition (EBACE) in Geneva, Switzerland, May 22, 2017. REUTERS/Denis Balibouse 3/3 By Tim Hepher and Alwyn Scott | PARIS/SEATTLE PARIS/SEATTLE Two words underpin Boeing's (BA.N) decision to launch a U.S. trade complaint against Bombardier (BBDb.TO), which plunged it into a row with Canada last week: "Never again". Allegations that the Canadian firm dumped newly designed CSeries passenger jets in the United States at a steep loss have threatened a sale of F/A-18 warplanes to Ottawa, sending Boeing scrambling to save the deal. Some analysts say Boeing carelessly put at risk billions of dollars of defense work or pandered to growing protectionism. But decades after Boeing failed to prevent European upstart Airbus gaining momentum with early victories in the United States, people familiar with the company say the strategic importance of defending its core passenger jet business outweighs the diplomatic storm. U.S. industry experts say Boeing and other jetmakers at the time did not take the European consortium seriously enough and allowed their future nemesis to poach U.S. airlines from 1978. Again after the September 2001 attacks in the United States, when Boeing slashed production, Airbus (AIR.PA) filled the vacuum, building up market share and never looking back. For years Boeing insiders have rued that decision, even while battling Airbus at the World Trade Organization (WTO) over mutual accusations of unfair subsidies. While leading in widebody jets, it has seen the narrowbody market – where the industry makes most cash - slip away as Airbus grabbed some 60 percent of new-generation sales. Such a significant imbalance in market share poses serious long-term risk to the loser in the Airbus-Boeing duopoly, because it creates a gap in costs that can't easily be bridged. Now, Boeing sees a second rival entering its domestic market with what it sees as low prices and is determined not to underestimate the threat again, people close to the company say. "It's a crucial entry market," said a person familiar with Boeing's strategy in taking on Bombardier. "This is the case Boeing might have brought against Airbus 40 years ago. Not taking action at the start led to consequences." On the surface, Boeing's case is about the sale of jets to Delta Air Lines at what Boeing claims were unfairly low prices. Bombardier denies Boeing's estimates of both the price and the cost at which it is able to make its new jet, while critics say Boeing accounting rules allow it to disguise weak pricing. While the high-profile deal ignited Boeing's complaint, executives say Boeing's stance reflects a longer-term concern. Although Bombardier's small narrowbody jet has so far barely scratched Boeing's larger 737 and has suffered a spate of financial problems, the all-new design disturbs a landscape made up mainly by makeovers of existing Airbus and Boeing models. With Airbus still well ahead on narrowbody orders even after a recent lull, Boeing can ill afford to be squeezed on two fronts. Even less so with new players like China arriving. A Boeing spokesman declined to comment. PRECISION TRADE WEAPON Boeing's response marries strategic worries about its narrowbody position with a legal tactic designed to exploit a vulnerability the CSeries has, but global rival Airbus did not. The 110-130 seat CSeries relies mainly for now on the regional jet market, where North America is by far the largest single component and whose airlines therefore decide its future. That hands Boeing the opportunity to make use of a domestic lawsuit ill-suited to its global confrontation with Airbus, but which if successful could deliver a hammer blow to the CSeries. Trade sources see a second tactical motive for spurning the WTO and filing the industry's first such domestic U.S. case. U.S. anti-dumping cases typically take a year - versus 13 years and counting in its trench warfare against Airbus. That coincides with first delivery of a CSeries to Delta in April 2018. If Boeing succeeds, the jets could be hit from day one with extra duties, blunting Bombardier's competitiveness more quickly and more directly than normal trade sanctions. Still, Boeing faces a headache over what to do about lost fighter sales if Canada makes good on a threat to drop a deal for F/A-18 warplanes in retaliation for Boeing's trade claim. With Boeing's future fighter production in jeopardy as sales run dry, Boeing is anxious to keep its presence in that business long enough to compete for tomorrow's military programs. But without stability in its narrowbody jetliner business, Boeing faces an even deeper concern, since this is the cash cow for many of the company's other activities. Sources says Boeing's defense bosses signed off on bringing the trade case, highlighting the importance attached to the 737. The broader stakes raised by Bombardier's foray into the U.S. market were underscored when China was reported to revive on-off talks to invest in Bombardier. Airbus itself weighed buying the CSeries before talks collapsed in 2015. Whoever wins the trade spat between Bombardier and Boeing, one thing is clear: the small jet from Montreal has made its mark on the strategic calculations of all industry rivals, and now faces a battle for new sales.

Some of the big winners in the deal include defense industrial giants Lockheed Martin, Boeing and Raytheon among others. The massive arms deal had been in the works for the past two years and was coordinated via the U.S.-Saudi Arabia Threat-Based Security Cooperation Working Group. Lockheed Martin garnered a substantial portion of the massive deal. Altogether, the company netted more than $28 billion from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA): - Letters of Offer and Acceptance and a Memorandum of Intent covering government-to-government sales of Lockheed Martin programs to include integrated air and missile defense systems, multi-mission surface combatant ships, radar systems, surveillance systems, tactical aircraft and rotary wing programs. - A Letter of Intent, between Lockheed Martin and Taqnia, to form a joint venture to support final assembly and completion of an estimated 150 S-70 Black Hawk utility helicopters for the Saudi government. The program supports work for more than 450 U.S. jobs including in Connecticut at Sikorsky and throughout the U. S. supply chain and also supports KSA's Vision 2030 by creating an additional 450 jobs in the Kingdom, developing local capabilities through technology and skills transfer, thus enhancing the U.S.-Saudi global security partnership. - A Memorandum of Understanding between Lockheed Martin and Saudi Arabian Military Industries for the parties to work together to build defense capabilities in the KSA to support Vision 2030 and provide for localization efforts associated with Multi-mission Surface Combatants and Aerostats. Meanwhile, Boeing also captured a significant portion of the deal, although the company did not list a dollar value for its share of the spoils. Perhaps more interestingly, Saudi Arabia will be purchasing the potent Boeing P-8 Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft. Boeing listed the following as just a portion of its share of the Saudi deal: - Agreements to purchase Chinook helicopters and associated support services as well as guided weapon systems. - Saudi Arabia’s intent to order P-8 maritime, patrol and reconnaissance aircraft, which are based on the Boeing 737 commercial airplane. - A joint venture with the Kingdom to provide sustainment services for a wide range of military platforms. The agreement also supports Saudi Arabia’s efforts to grow its indigenous aerospace industry and ecosystem through its Vision 2030 initiative. - A commercial registration certificate for the Saudi Rotorcraft Support Company, a newly formed joint venture between Boeing, Alsalam Aerospace Industries and Saudia Aerospace Engineering Industries with bases in both Riyadh and Jeddah that will provide support for both military and commercial helicopters. - An agreement between Boeing and SaudiGulf Airlines to negotiate the sale of up to 16 widebody airplanes. Raytheon did not offer a detailed breakdown of what exactly it will sell to Saudi Arabia under the deal, but most of the equipment is related to command and control hardware. - The agreement will enable continued global growth for Raytheon in key market areas such as Air Defense Systems, Smart Munitions, C4I Systems and Cyber Security of Defense Systems and Platforms. This partnership will also contribute directly to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia's localized defense ecosystem with regional expert capabilities, and will provide a long-term foundation for Saudi Arabia's economic development. - As part of this new agreement, Raytheon today announced plans to establish Raytheon Arabia, a Saudi legal entity wholly-owned by Raytheon that will focus on implementing programs to create indigenous defense, aerospace and security capabilities in the Kingdom. The new company will be based in Riyadh and is expected to include in-country program management, supply and sourcing capabilities, improved customer access and centralized accountability. These programs will positively impact Saudi and U.S. economies including job creation. Other defense contractors such as General Dynamics, Northrop Grumman, BAE Systems and others that have almost certainly gained substantially from the Saudi deal have not been as forthcoming. More detail will likely become available as time passes. Dave Majumdar is the defense editor for the National Interest. You can follow him on Twitter: @davemajumdar.

Allegations that the Canadian firm dumped newly designed CSeries passenger jets in the United States at a steep loss have threatened a sale of F/A-18 warplanes to Ottawa, sending Boeing scrambling to save the deal. Some analysts say Boeing carelessly put at risk billions of dollars of defence work or pandered to growing protectionism. But decades after Boeing failed to prevent European upstart Airbus gaining momentum with early victories in the United States, people familiar with the company say the strategic importance of defending its core passenger jet business outweighs the diplomatic storm. U.S. industry experts say Boeing and other jetmakers at the time did not take the European consortium seriously enough and allowed their future nemesis to poach U.S. airlines from 1978. Again after the September 2001 attacks in the United States, when Boeing slashed production, Airbus filled the vacuum, building up market share and never looking back. For years Boeing insiders have rued that decision, even while battling Airbus at the World Trade Organization (WTO) over mutual accusations of unfair subsidies. While leading in widebody jets, it has seen the narrowbody market – where the industry makes most cash - slip away as Airbus grabbed some 60 percent of new-generation sales. Such a significant imbalance in market share poses serious long-term risk to the loser in the Airbus-Boeing duopoly, because it creates a gap in costs that can't easily be bridged. Now, Boeing sees a second rival entering its domestic market with what it sees as low prices and is determined not to underestimate the threat again, people close to the company say. "It's a crucial entry market," said a person familiar with Boeing's strategy in taking on Bombardier. "This is the case Boeing might have brought against Airbus 40 years ago. Not taking action at the start led to consequences." On the surface, Boeing's case is about the sale of jets to Delta Air Lines at what Boeing claims were unfairly low prices. Bombardier denies Boeing's estimates of both the price and the cost at which it is able to make its new jet, while critics say Boeing accounting rules allow it to disguise weak pricing. While the high-profile deal ignited Boeing's complaint, executives say Boeing's stance reflects a longer-term concern. Although Bombardier's small narrowbody jet has so far barely scratched Boeing's larger 737 and has suffered a spate of financial problems, the all-new design disturbs a landscape made up mainly by makeovers of existing Airbus and Boeing models. With Airbus still well ahead on narrowbody orders even after a recent lull, Boeing can ill afford to be squeezed on two fronts. Even less so with new players like China arriving. A Boeing spokesman declined to comment. PRECISION TRADE WEAPON Boeing's response marries strategic worries about its narrowbody position with a legal tactic designed to exploit a vulnerability the CSeries has, but global rival Airbus did not. The 110-130 seat CSeries relies mainly for now on the regional jet market, where North America is by far the largest single component and whose airlines therefore decide its future. That hands Boeing the opportunity to make use of a domestic lawsuit ill-suited to its global confrontation with Airbus, but which if successful could deliver a hammer blow to the CSeries. Trade sources see a second tactical motive for spurning the WTO and filing the industry's first such domestic U.S. case. U.S. anti-dumping cases typically take a year - versus 13 years and counting in its trench warfare against Airbus. That coincides with first delivery of a CSeries to Delta in April 2018. If Boeing succeeds, the jets could be hit from day one with extra duties, blunting Bombardier's competitiveness more quickly and more directly than normal trade sanctions. Still, Boeing faces a headache over what to do about lost fighter sales if Canada makes good on a threat to drop a deal for F/A-18 warplanes in retaliation for Boeing's trade claim. With Boeing's future fighter production in jeopardy as sales run dry, Boeing is anxious to keep its presence in that business long enough to compete for tomorrow's military programmes. But without stability in its narrowbody jetliner business, Boeing faces an even deeper concern, since this is the cash cow for many of the company's other activities. Sources says Boeing's defence bosses signed off on bringing the trade case, highlighting the importance attached to the 737. The broader stakes raised by Bombardier's foray into the U.S. market were underscored when China was reported to revive on-off talks to invest in Bombardier. Airbus itself weighed buying the CSeries before talks collapsed in 2015. Whoever wins the trade spat between Bombardier and Boeing, one thing is clear: the small jet from Montreal has made its mark on the strategic calculations of all industry rivals, and now faces a battle for new sales.

jalopnik Deadspin Fusion Gizmodo Jalopnik Jezebel Kotaku Lifehacker The Root Video Jalopnik Reviews Foxtrot Alpha Black Flag Truck Yeah Lanesplitter The Garage This Is A Bathroom On An Airplane David TracyYesterday 11:53am Filed to: boeing jets bathrooms 94 4 Edit Promote Share to Kinja Toggle Conversation tools Go to permalink Photo: Boeing Let’s have a bit of fun and compare my bathroom to the one on a Boeing Business Jet, which the company has been showing off at the European Business Aviation Convention & Exhibition, or EBACE, in Geneva to make us all feel bad about ourselves. In an effort to give into Boeing’s clear attempt to make me feel like a good-for-nothing “poor,” I just compared my own bathroom (which is built in the proper habitat for bathrooms—on land) to Boeing’s water closet in the sky. As you can see, the Boeing bathroom—which is just a temporary restroom for occasional bowel movements during business travel—has a nice wide sink counter probably made of elephants’ tusks, tons of shelving and closets probably made out of the middle class’s hopes and dreams, a big wide mirror probably made of diamond, and a fantastic faucet that pours out tears from suckers known as taxpayers. Advertisement Plus, unless Boeing found a shrunken bar of soap and a bunch of smurf-sized bottles of shampoo, that bathroom looks enormous. By contrast, my bathroom—which isn’t temporary, and in which I have no choice but to have the vast majority of my bowel movements—is so small, the only way I could get the whole thing in the frame was to take this photo through the doorway. Look at this pathetic thing: And what you see through the doorway is pretty much all there is. There’s a sink, a toilet and a shower, all far too close in proximity to one another. That means when I sit down to engage in human weight savings, my feet are right up against the sink, and when I get out of the shower, I’ve got to somehow squeeze between the sink and the sliding pane of glass—a move that has sent me on my ass a number of times. That’s not even mentioning the disaster that lies behind those no-longer-transparent sliding glass panes—it’s bad. I should probably clean it. Plus, just look at the “tiles.” My walls are literally held up by screws: So to Boeing, I say: I get it. Your little jet bathroom is better than mine (and frankly, my entire house) in every way, and I’m a worthless little poor. The rest of the jet is pretty nice, too.

The X-32 escaped all of the most significant challenges to the F-35. The X-32 never faced decades of testing and redesign; it never saw massive cost overruns; it was never subjected to an endless series of articles about how it couldn’t out-dogfight an F-16A. Nostalgia for what might have been is common in aircraft competitions, and it’s impossible to say whether the X-32 would have run into the same difficulties of the F-35.  Given the complex nature of advanced fighter projects, the answer is almost certainly “yes.” The Department of Defense (DoD) didn’t have to opt for the F-35. In the 1990s, both Boeing and Lockheed Martin bid for the next big fighter contract, a plane that would serve in each of the Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps, as well as grace the air forces of many US allies. Boeing served up the X-32; Lockheed the X-35. The Pentagon chose the F-35. Given the struggles of the last decade with the Joint Strike Fighter, it’s impossible not to wonder about what might have been; what if DoD had gone with Boeing’s X-32 instead, or with some combination of the two aircraft? History: At the end of the Cold War, the Pentagon proposed a joint fighter project in the hopes of reducing the overall logistical tail of fielded forces, as well as in minimizing development costs. Each of the three fighter-flying services needed replacements for the 4th generation aircraft in their inventory; the F-15 and F-16 in the case of the Air Force, and the F/A-18 and AV-8B Harrier in the case of the Navy and the Marine Corps. The new fighter, thus, needed conventional, carrier, and STOVL (short take off vertical landing) configurations. DoD had not, historically, had good luck with joint programs, but the hope was that increased “jointness” between the services, combined with more advanced production techniques and more carefully refined logistics procedures, would make a shared fighter worth the effort. All parties understood that the winner of the competition would likely enjoy a great deal of export success, as many air forces around the world required a fifth-generation fighter. In short, this was the biggest deal on the horizon of the post-Cold War defense industry.  Boeing and Lockheed Martin won contracts to develop two demonstrators each. Capabilities: Built to the same specifications, the X-32 and the F-35 had relatively similar performance parameters. Deciding to compete on cost, Boeing designed the X-32 around a single-piece delta wing that would fit all three variants. The X-32 lacked the shaft-driven turbofan lift of the F-35, instead using the same thrust vectoring system as the AV-8 Harrier. The X-32’s system was less advanced than the F-35’s, but also less complex. The X-32 was designed to reach Mach 1.6 in conventional flight. It could carry either six AMRAAMs or two missiles and two bombs in its internal weapons bay. Range and stealth characteristics were generally similar to those expected of the F-35, and the body of the aircraft could accommodate much of the advanced electronic equipment that the F-35 now carries. Decision: One thing is for certain; the X-32 was a ridiculously ugly aircraft. It looked like nothing so much as the spawn of an A-7 Corsair and a hideously deformed manatee. The F-35 is no prize from an aesthetic point of view, lacking the sleek, dangerous lines of the F-22, but the X-32 made the F-35 look positively sexy by comparison. How much should this matter? Not a bit. How much did it matter? Good question. Fighter pilots don’t like to fly aircraft that look like they could be run over by Florida speed boat. On more concrete grounds, Boeing’s strategy probably hurt its chances. Instead of building one demonstrator capable of fulfilling the requirements of all three services, Boeing built two; one capable of conventional supersonic flight, and the other of vertical take-off and landing. Lockheed’s prototype could do both. The Pentagon also liked the innovative (if risky) nature of the F-35’s turbolift. Finally, Lockheed’s experience with the F-22 suggested that it could probably handle another large stealth fighter project.

MANDEL NGAN/AFP/Getty Image Related Media Gallery: A look inside Lufthansa Technik's Frankfurt MRO facility Advertisement [UPDATED] Boeing said it has agreed to negotiate a widebody aircraft order with Saudi Arabian startup SaudiGulf Airlines for as many as 16 aircraft, which the airline indicated will be 777s and/or 787s. The Dammam-based carrier started operations in October 2016 with what it described as an upscale, full-service offering that it hopes will differentiate it from other carriers in the Saudi domestic market. The airline currently operates a fleet of four Airbus A320ceo aircraft. It has 16 Bombardier CS300 aircraft on firm order, plus 10 options. The news that the airline has entered into talks with Boeing about a widebody order came in a Boeing press release detailing a number of deals, mostly military, between Boeing and Saudi Arabia that were announced in connection with US President Donald Trump’s visit to Saudi Arabia over the weekend. The airline currently only operates domestic flights, serving Dammam, Jeddah, Riyadh and Abha. It has indicated it will fly internationally to Dubai, but Dubai is not listed as a destination on SaudiGulf’s website. SaudiGulf CCO Karim Makhlouf told ATW that long-haul flights are in the airline’s mid- to long-term plan. Destinations have not yet been decided on, but Southeast Asia is one region of interest, both for normal services and religious traffic heading to Saudi Arabia to perform the Hajj and Umrah pilgrimages. SaudiGulf is considering both the 777 and 787 for its future requirements, he said, with a decision to be made “within the next two to three years.” Makhlouf said SaudiGulf is also considering moving from the A320 to the larger A321 as its passenger numbers grow. “In common with most operators, once the A320 successfully reaches certain loads or thresholds, you typically grow into the next size,” he explained. Load factors on its A320s are reaching 60%, which is “not bad and in line with projections,” Makhlouf said.

State-run Chinese manufacturer Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC) and Russia's United Aircraft Corporation (UAC) said they formally established the previously announced joint venture in Shanghai on Monday. Plans for the wide-body jet were first unveiled last June when visiting Russian President Vladimir Putin met China's Xi Jinping in Beijing, and Chinese state media have previously quoted officials saying the project could be worth between $13 billion and $20 billion. "The establishment of the joint-venture company symbolises the important progress made in the China-Russia long-range wide-body passenger aircraft project," COMAC chairman Jin Zhuanglong said in a statement. "We will cooperate sincerely with UAC, unite as one, and strive to make the .... Project a model of Sino-Russian cooperation." China had already logged a key milestone in the country's ambitious journey to compete with the world's leading aircraft makers in early May with the test flight in Shanghai of COMAC's narrow-body C919 jet. The 168-seat C919, built for shorter regional routes, represents nearly a decade of effort in a government-mandated drive to reduce dependence on European consortium Airbus and US aerospace giant Boeing. Airbus and Boeing dominate China's market for passenger jets, which is growing in leaps and bounds as travel demand by Chinese consumers skyrockets. Aviation analysts, while acknowledging the C919 as a technical milestone for China, have warned that it faces a tough task challenging against Boeing and Airbus, with their deep market penetration and long history of performance. But with the China-Russia jet, which Chinese media reports say will be called the 929, Beijing will have the benefit of working with UAC, parent of passenger-jet manufacturer Sukhoi and other established Russian aviation brands. COMAC's statement said the aircraft will be able to seat 280 passengers and have a range of 12,000 kilometres. That would put it in direct competition with Boeing's 787 and the Airbus A350. China's state-run Global Times newspaper late last year quoted UAC president Yury Slyusar as saying the project would be worth between $13 billion and $20 billion, with each side contributing half. In Monday's joint statement, Slyusar said the project is "testimony to China and Russia's determination to engage in long-term cooperation". COMAC said last year the planned jet could take its first flight in seven years, with deliveries beginning three years after that. Previous Chinese aerospace projects have suffered lengthy delays. China is expected to become the world's largest aviation market within several years, and President Xi has stressed the importance of Chinese-made jets handling much of that growing traffic. Airbus has estimated China will need nearly 6,000 new planes worth $945 billion in the next two decades, with Boeing's forecast even more optimistic at more than $1 trillion.

The Dow Jones industrial average and S&P 500 each climbed 0.4%. The Nasdaq also swung up 0.4%, while the Russell 2000 futures popped 0.5%. Early Risers: Boeing, Apple, Ford, Lockheed Defense stocks fueled a large share of Monday's early action, stirred by more than $300 billion in deals announced Saturday between Saudi Arabia and the U.S. as part of Trump's official visit to Saudi Arabia. Boeing (BA) topped the Dow industrial in early trade, up 1.3%. The company announced on Sunday potential deals for up to 16 widebody jets with SaudiGulf Airlines, as well as a number of military-use jets. Boeing shares are trading below a flat base buy point of 85.81, ending Friday in a test of support at their 10-week moving average. Dow peer General Electric (GE) rose -0.8%. On Saturday, GE announced $12 billion in contracts with the country, focusing on energy, aviation and other areas. Raytheon (RTN) opened 1% higher. The Waltham, Mass.-based aerospace electronics leader on Saturday announced a strategic partnership with the Saudi Arabia Military Industries Company related to air defense systems, smart munitions, defense cyber security and other areas. Raytheon shares remain in a buy range, above a 157.69 buy point in a flat base. Lockheed Martin (LMT) opened 2% higher on its own slate of Saudi deals, which include $28 billion in missile defense systems, naval ships, and helicopters, among other items. Shares retook a 270 buy point on Friday. Oilfield equipment maker National Oilwell Varco (NOV) added more than 1%, boosted by a joint venture to provide Saudi Aramco with high-specification drilling rigs and advanced drilling equipment, as well as training to Saudi engineers, over a 10-year period. Ford (F) opened up more than 1%. Ford replaced Chief Executive Mark Fields with Jim Hackett, the former CEO of Steelcase (SCS) who has headed Ford's Smart Mobility experimental operations unit. A press conference has been scheduled for 9:45 am ET today. Fields has held the CEO seat for three years. Ford shares have been in a 34-month decline. The tone was also generally positive among technology stocks. Apple rose 0.7%. A note from RBC Capital reiterated the stock's outperform rating and raised its price target to 168, from 157. The note said the company's multiple strengths could lift its market capitalization above $1 trillion in 12 to 18 months.

Chemicals maker Huntsman (HUN) leapt 2% in opening action to a new high. The company agreed to a takeover bid from Switzerland-based Clariant. The all-stock deal would create a chemicals operation with revenue of around $15 billion.

West Texas Intermediate benchmark crude backed off its early highs, trading up 0.7% in early action, just below $51 per barrel. Europe's markets remained mixed in afternoon trade, rattled by comments from German Chancellor Angela Merkel blaming the European Central Bank for a weak euro. China's markets ended sharply mixed, with Hong Kong's Hang Seng index rallying 0.9% while the Shanghai Composite dived 0.5%. The two indexes have generally been moving in opposite directions since late April. In Japan, the Nikkei 225 added 0.5%. The Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago's National Activity Index reported a big jump of industrial activity in April, sending the index to a reading of 0.49 - its best reading since November 2014. That was far above March's 0.08 tally , as well as economist projections for an increase to 0.10.

The aerospace giant BA, +1.61%  said SaudiGulf Airlines is looking to acquire up to 16 twin-aisle jets, though it didn’t identify the model or potential delivery dates in a market where sales have been sluggish over the past two years. The weekend bonanza of potential arms sales signed during President Donald Trump’s state visit to Saudi Arabia included Boeing Chinook helicopters, a previously-announced agreement that has already been cleared by Congress.

State-owned Commercial Aircraft Corp. of China Ltd. and Russia’s United Aircraft Corp. aim to hand over the plane to customers by 2025-2027, UAC Chairman Yury Slyusar said at a briefing in Shanghai Monday. The new plane will need “billions of U.S. dollars” in investment, he said. The venture will develop a 280-seat aircraft that can fly about 12,000 kilometers (7,500 miles), or more than the distance between London and Singapore. Earlier this month, Comac’s C919, China’s first modern passenger jet, took off on its maiden test flight from Shanghai as the nation tries to break into the near-duopoly of Airbus and Boeing in the market for planes with more than 100 seats. President Xi Jinping’s ‘Made in China 2025’ program has identified aerospace among sectors that could help turn the country into an advanced economy. More from Bloomberg.com: Trump Dials Back Islam Critique as He Basks in Saudi Deals The large jet’s research and development will be in Moscow while assembly will be in Shanghai, Comac Chairman Jin Zhuanglong said. The companies will seek out an engine supplier for the program and tenders will be sent by the end of the year and for components next year, said Guo Bozhi, an assistant president at Comac in charge of the project. The China-Russia 280-seat plane will compete against models including Airbus’s A330 and Boeing’s 777, twin-aisle aircraft that are mostly used for trans-continental flights. Cheaper costs will be one of the advantages of the new plane, Guo said.

BOX - China’s Hainan Airlines to buy 19 Boeing jets for $4.2b SHANGHAI China’s Hainan Airlines, which has poured billions of dollars into overseas acquisitions, announced plans Monday to buy 19 Boeing aircraft for $4.2 billion (Dh15.4 billion) to help meet skyrocketing travel demand by Chinese consumers. The company said in a statement to Shanghai’s stock exchange that it would buy 13 Boeing 787-9 passenger jets and six 737-8s, citing the continued “rapid growth” in China’s travel market as incomes rise. It plans to issue 15 billion yuan ($2.18 billion) in bonds to help fund the deal. Chinese airlines have seen booming business in recent years, rushing to expand their fleets and route networks amid growth that the International Air Transport Association (IATA) predicts will take China past the United States to become the world’s largest air-travel market by 2024. Hainan Airlines and its parent HNA Group have been among the most acquisitive players in a wave of overseas investments by Chinese companies in recent years. HNA is a sprawling conglomerate with interests in aviation and tourism. -AFP More from Aviation Passenger traffic at Abu Dhabi Airport up 5.6% Emirates to launch second A380 to Birmingham Cathay makes biggest job cuts in 20 years China, Russia aim to deliver big jets by 2027 Airline suspends Abu Dhabi-Manila flights Airline to terminate 600 employees Boeing signs deals with Saudi Arabia Qantas flight turns back after engine problem tags from this storyUnited States follow this tag on MGNRussia follow this tag on MGNChina follow this tag on MGNXi Jinping follow this tag on MGN filed underGulfNewsBusinessAviation tagsUnited States follow this tag on MGN+ MGNRussia follow this tag on MGN+ MGNChina follow this tag on MGN+ MGNXi Jinping follow this tag on MGN+ MGN Also In AviationPassenger traffic at Abu Dhabi Airport up 5.6% Business Gallery Doors open to a three-day super sale Mohammad launches Marsa Al Arab project Business Videos PlayAbu Dhabi Ship Building enjoys growing success Strata UAE leads aerospace manufacturing FOLLOW US Most Popular ViewedCommentedGalleriesVideos 01Airline suspends Abu Dhabi-Manila flights 02Airline to terminate 600 employees 03Emirates to launch second A380 to Birmingham 04Cathay makes biggest job cuts in 20 years 05Passenger traffic at Abu Dhabi Airport up 5.6% 13Images Mohammad launches Marsa Al Arab project May 15, 2017 1Image Pictures: Apple Store at Mall of the Emirates Oct 27, 2015 8Images Massive development at Abu Dhabi airport Mar 11, 2017 8Images Pictures: Apple Store in Abu Dhabi Oct 27, 2015 Play Abu Dhabi Ship Building enjoys growing success Nov 24, 2016 Play Strata UAE leads aerospace manufacturing Oct 25, 2016 Play Emirati who created 2 successful companies Jan 02, 2016 Play Dragon Mart has latest and cheapest iPads Mar 03, 2011 Explore the UAE Find the right airport Currency Converter first-currency currencyAEDDinarRupee= first-currency currencyINRDinarRupee Most Popular on Gulf News Ramadan school timings announced When can the UAE expect Ramadan?

State-run Chinese manufacturer Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC) and Russia's United Aircraft Corporation (UAC) said they formally established the previously announced joint venture in Shanghai today. Plans for the wide-body jet were first unveiled last June when visiting Russian President Vladimir Putin met China's Xi Jinping in Beijing, and Chinese state media have previously quoted officials saying the project could be worth between USD 13 billion and USD 20 billion. "The establishment of the joint-venture company symbolises the important progress made in the China-Russia long-range wide-body passenger aircraft project," COMAC chairman Jin Zhuanglong said in a statement. "We will cooperate sincerely with UAC, unite as one, and strive to make the .... Project a model of Sino-Russian cooperation." China had already logged a key milestone in the country's ambitious journey to compete with the world's leading aircraft makers in early May with the test flight in Shanghai of COMAC's narrow-body C919 jet. The 168-seat C919, built for shorter regional routes, represents nearly a decade of effort in a government-mandated drive to reduce dependence on European consortium Airbus and US aerospace giant Boeing. Airbus and Boeing dominate China's market for passenger jets, which is growing in leaps and bounds as travel demand by Chinese consumers skyrockets. Aviation analysts, while acknowledging the C919 as a technical milestone for China, have warned that it faces a tough task challenging against Boeing and Airbus, with their deep market penetration and long history of performance. But with the China-Russia jet, which Chinese media reports say will be called the 929, Beijing will have the benefit of working with UAC, parent of passenger-jet manufacturer Sukhoi and other established Russian aviation brands. COMAC's statement said the aircraft will be able to seat 280 passengers and have a range of 12,000 kilometres. That would put it in direct competition with Boeing's 787 and the Airbus A350. China's state-run Global Times newspaper late last year quoted UAC president Yury Slyusar as saying the project would be worth between USD 13 billion and USD 20 billion, with each side contributing half. In today's joint statement, Slyusar said the project is "testimony to China and Russia's determination to engage in long-term cooperation". COMAC said last year the planned jet could take its first flight in seven years, with deliveries beginning three years after that. Previous Chinese aerospace projects have suffered lengthy delays. China is expected to become the world's largest aviation market within several years, and President Xi has stressed the importance of Chinese-made jets handling much of that growing traffic. Airbus has estimated China will need nearly 6,000 new planes worth USD 945 billion in the next two decades, with Boeing's forecast even more optimistic at more than USD 1 trillion.

Aviation analysts, while acknowledging the C919 as a technical milestone for China, have warned that it faces a tough task challenging against Boeing and Airbus, with their deep market penetration and long history of performance. But with the China-Russia jet, which Chinese media reports say will be called the 929, Beijing will have the benefit of working with UAC, parent of passenger-jet manufacturer Sukhoi and other established Russian aviation brands. COMAC's statement said the aircraft will be able to seat 280 passengers and have a range of 12,000 kilometres. That would put it in direct competition with Boeing's 787 and the Airbus A350. China's state-run Global Times newspaper late last year quoted UAC president Yury Slyusar as saying the project would be worth between USD 13 billion and USD 20 billion, with each side contributing half. In today's joint statement, Slyusar said the project is "testimony to China and Russia's determination to engage in long-term cooperation". COMAC said last year the planned jet could take its first flight in seven years, with deliveries beginning three years after that. Previous Chinese aerospace projects have suffered lengthy delays. China is expected to become the world's largest aviation market within several years, and President Xi has stressed the importance of Chinese-made jets handling much of that growing traffic. Airbus has estimated China will need nearly 6,000 new planes worth USD 945 billion in the next two decades, with Boeing's forecast even more optimistic at more than USD 1 trillion.

Two positive analyst reports. And over the weekend, some deals with Saudi Arabia. Add it all up and Boeing shares closed Friday at $180.76, up 16% year to date, the third-best performance among the 30 stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which has risen 5% so far this year, while the S&P 500 has gained 6%. In premarket trading Monday, shares were up 59 cents to $181.35. Still, shares are down from the all-time high of $187.21 they reached during the day on May 10. Trouble soon followed. The next day, Boeing announced it had temporarily halted test flights of the new 737 MAX due to an engine issue; shares traded as low as $178.18. On May 16, with the problem resolved, Boeing delivered the first MAX 8 to Malaysian carrier Malindo Air and shares closed at $182.70. Two days later on May 18, Canada threatened to abandon plans to buy 18 Super Hornet jets if the U.S. government backed Boeing's claim that Canada's Bombardier sold C-100s to Delta below cost. Boeing shares closed at $177.40. On Friday, May 19, shares rebounded as Reuters reported that Boeing defense officials were trying to save the Super Hornet deal. Shares may benefit Monday from the impact of deals with Saudi Arabia. "Several defense and commercial agreements announced yesterday will further strengthen Boeing's partnership with Saudi Arabia," Boeing said Sunday.  Included are Saudi Arabia's agreements to purchase Chinook helicopters, support services and guided weapon systems; Saudi Arabia's intent to order P-8 aircraft, which are based on the 737; a joint venture to provide sustainment services for various military platforms; a commercial registration certificate for the Saudi Rotorcraft Support Company, a newly formed joint venture between Boeing and two Saudi companies; and an agreement that SaudiGulf Airlines will negotiate to buy up to 16 widebody aircraft. "Our decades-long partnership with the Kingdom began in 1945 when President Roosevelt presented a DC-3 to King Abdul Aziz Al Saud, launching commercial air travel in the region," said Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg, in a prepared statement. "We welcome the opportunity to continue that support." Analysts took the earlier news events in stride. In a report issued May 17, Moody's analyst Jeanine Arnold maintained a positive outlook on the global aerospace and defense industry, although she cut her aggregate operating profit outlook through 2018 to between 3% and 5%, down from between 4% and 6%. The "growth is primarily due to increased deliveries of commercial aircraft, higher defense spending,growing contributions of typically higher-margin aftermarket services and financial benefits of cost management programs," Arnold said. The reduced outlook reflects higher-than-expected cost pressures.

Since the birth of commercial air travel in the Kingdom in 1945, Boeing Company has established “a strong and long-standing relationship with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia,” the company says on its website. The partnership in the aviation sector began on February 14, 1945 when US President Franklin D. Roosevelt presented a twin-engine DC-3 Dakota airplane to Saudi King Abdul Aziz Al Saud, according to a report by Boeing. The event marked both the beginning of the Boeing relationship with Saudi Arabia and the birth of commercial air travel in the Kingdom, the company added. “Since then, Boeing has developed and expanded relationships with the Saudi civilian and defense sectors as well as with the private sectors,” the report also said. The company underlined Saudi Arabia’s importance to Boeing, which was reaffirmed in 1982, with the establishment of Boeing Middle East Limited in the Saudi capital of Riyadh, as a 100 percent Boeing-owned commercially registered company, with full commercial contracting and employee sponsorship rights equal to any other Saudi-owned and registered company. “In 2013, the company was renamed Boeing Saudi Arabia to reflect the broad scope of Boeing activities; today, Boeing Saudi Arabia supports the execution of all Boeing Defense, Space & Security and Boeing Commercial Airplanes programs in Saudi Arabia,” the company said. It added that in February 2016, the Saudi Arabia Airlines (Saudia) received its first three 787-9s along with a 777-300ER at a high-profile delivery ceremony at Boeing’s site Seattle. “Over the years Saudia has taken delivery of more than 135 Boeing airplanes including 707, 737, 747, 777, 787, MD-11F, DC-3, DC-4, DC-9 and MD-90 models. It currently operates many different types of Boeing airplanes, including 747-300SP, 777-200ER, 777-300ER and 787-9 Dreamliner,” it stated.

  Home U.K. News Sports U.S. Showbiz Australia Femail Health Science Money Video Travel Columnists Wires Home My Profile Logout Login Feedback NEW ARTICLESHomeTop Share show ad China, Russia set up wide-body jet firm in new challenge to Boeing, Airbus By Reuters Published: 06:49 EDT, 22 May 2017 | Updated: 06:49 EDT, 22 May 2017 e-mail By Brenda Goh SHANGHAI, May 22 (Reuters) - China and Russia on Monday completed the formal registration of a joint venture to build a wide-body jet, kick-starting full-scale development of a programme aimed at competing with market leaders Boeing Co and Airbus SE. State plane makers Commercial Aircraft Corp of China Ltd (COMAC) and Russia's United Aircraft Corp (UAC) said at a ceremony in Shanghai the venture would aim to build a "competitive long range wide-body commercial aircraft". The announcement comes just weeks after COMAC successfully completed the maiden flight of its C919, China's first home-grown narrow-body passenger jet. COMAC President Jin Zhuanglong said the two firms had decided to hold the establishment ceremony after the C919's flight. "This programme is aimed at fulfilling future market demand," he told reporters. "Our two countries, our two firms ... have created this joint venture to undertake responsibilities such as organisation, research, management and implementation." The programme will have a research centre in Moscow and assembly line in Shanghai, he said, adding division of labour was still being discussed. Guo Bozhi, general manager of COMAC's wide-body department, said the venture would ask suppliers to bid for the contract to build the engine by year-end. MAIDEN FLIGHT COMAC and UAC first announced the programme in 2014. In November, they said they had set up a joint venture in Shanghai and unveiled a mock-up of the basic version of the jet that would have a range of up to 12,000 kilometres (7,500 miles) and seat 280 passengers. UAC President Yuri Slyusar said the firms looked to complete the maiden flight and first delivery during 2025-2028, and aimed to take 10 percent of a market dominated by the Boeing 787 and Airbus A350. Previously, they targeted a maiden flight in 2022 and delivery in or after 2025. UAC is also developing a version of Russian wide-body jet Ilyushin IL-96. Slyusar said the two programmes had different requirements, and that UAC would use experience with the IL-96 to aid development of the Chinese-Russian jet. UAC and COMAC hold equal shares in their venture, whose jet they said would be 10-15 percent cheaper to run than planes from Boeing and Airbus. Last July, Boeing forecast airlines worldwide would need 9,100 wide-body planes over 20 years through 2035, with a wave of replacement demand around 2021-2028. Over the past decade, China has ploughed billions of dollars into domestic jet development to raise its profile in global aviation and boost high-tech manufacturing.

China and Russia on May 22 launched an ambitious project to jointly develop a long-haul jet to challenge Boeing and Airbus, just two weeks after the successful test flight of the first made-in-China large passenger plane. State-run Chinese manufacturer Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC) and Russia's United Aircraft Corporation (UAC) said they formally established the previously announced joint venture in Shanghai on May 22. Plans for the wide-body jet were first unveiled last June when visiting Russian President Vladimir Putin met China's Xi Jinping in Beijing, and Chinese state media have previously quoted officials saying the project could be worth between US $13 billion and US $20 billion. Jin Zhuanglong COMAC chairman "The establishment of the joint-venture company symbolises the important progress made in the China-Russia long-range wide-body passenger aircraft project. We will cooperate sincerely with UAC, unite as one, and strive to make the project a model of Sino-Russian cooperation." China had already logged a key milestone in the country's ambitious journey to compete with the world's leading aircraft makers in early May with the test flight in Shanghai of COMAC's narrow-body C919 jet. The 168-seat C919, built for shorter regional routes, represents nearly a decade of effort in a government-mandated drive to reduce dependence on European consortium Airbus and US aerospace giant Boeing. Airbus and Boeing dominate China's market for passenger jets, which is growing in leaps and bounds as travel demand by Chinese consumers skyrockets. ALSO READ As Boeing booms, robots rise and job growth lags Aviation analysts, while acknowledging the C919 as a technical milestone for China, have warned that it faces a tough task challenging against Boeing and Airbus, with their deep market penetration and long history of performance. But with the China-Russia jet, which Chinese media reports say will be called the 929, Beijing will have the benefit of working with UAC, parent of passenger-jet manufacturer Sukhoi and other established Russian aviation brands. COMAC's statement said the aircraft will be able to seat 280 passengers and have a range of 12,000 kilometres putting it in direct competition with Boeing's 787 and the Airbus A350. China's state-run Global Times newspaper in late 2016 quoted UAC president Yury Slyusar as saying the project would be worth between US $13 billion and US $20 billion, with each side contributing half. In May 22's joint statement, Slyusar said the project is "testimony to China and Russia's determination to engage in long-term cooperation". COMAC said in 2016 the planned jet could take its first flight in seven years, with deliveries beginning three years after that. Previous Chinese aerospace projects have suffered lengthy delays. China is expected to become the world's largest aviation market within several years, and President Xi has stressed the importance of Chinese-made jets handling much of that growing traffic. Airbus has estimated China will need nearly 6,000 new planes worth US $945 billion in the next two decades, with Boeing's forecast even more optimistic at more than US $1 trillion.

23.05.2017 11:08   новости на русском azərbaycan dilində Facebook Twitter Google+ RSS Main page Latest News Analytics Politics Business Society Sports Arts & Entertainment Azernews.az World news Weird / Interesting Photo Galleries Voice of Diaspora Your Corner TODAY.AZ / Politics Azerbaijan helps U.S. to save thousands of jobs, ambassador says 22 May 2017 [13:54] - TODAY.AZ By Azernews By Amina Nazarli Azerbaijan, a strategically located partner of the United States in the Caspian region, is emerging as a key transportation hub along the historic Silk Road as demonstrated by Azerbaijan’s Silk Way Airlines’ recent purchase of 10 new Boeing 737-Max 8 aircraft to be built at Boeing’s plant in Renton.  Elin Suleymanov, Azerbaijan’s ambassador to the U. S. said this in an article published Herald net. “While offering economic opportunities and stabilizing energy supplies, Azerbaijan stands with the U.S. in struggling against terrorism and striving for a more peaceful world,” he said. The ambassador noted that the contract for the purchase of American aircraft helps support more than 12,000 workers at the assembly plant in Renton, which will increase production and ramp up hiring. In the highly cyclical aerospace industry, now suffering declining demand for widebody jets, Azerbaijan’s emergence as an export market for Boeing can counter pressures for further job losses, such as the recent layoffs of engineers. This is Azerbaijan’s third major investment in Boeing aircraft. In 2015, Silk Way purchased three Boeing 747-8 freighters manufactured at Boeing’s factory in Everett, with a total of 30,000 workers, according to Suleymanov. “That same year, Azerbaijan Airlines — our country’s flag carrier and largest airline — acquired its first Boeing 787 Dreamliner, assembled in South Carolina. Today, Azerbaijan Airlines Dreamliner (an aircraft built in both states) connect our countries via a nonstop Baku-New York flight. The ambassador said he is proud that Azerbaijan is contributing to a sector that supports some 252,800 jobs in Washington, with $21 billion in wages and nearly $95 billion in economic activity.  Azerbaijan’s partnership with the U.S. extends far beyond buying jetliners, he said. Bordering Iran and Russia, Azerbaijan is a trusted ally in a tough neighborhood. Within 24 hours of the September 11, 2001, attacks, Azerbaijan offered the U.S. unconditional support against terrorism, granting American military aircraft over-flights for a third of the non-lethal supplies for coalition forces, while Azerbaijani soldiers serve shoulder to shoulder with Americans in Afghanistan. “We continue to cooperate with the U.S. and its allies to combat terrorism, nuclear proliferation and narcotics trafficking. With 7 billion barrels of oil reserves and 30 trillion cubic feet of natural gas reserves, Azerbaijan provides about a million barrels of oil a day to Europe, as well as 40 percent of Israel’s consumption. Through the new Southern Gas Corridor pipeline network, Azerbaijan will also bring 16 billion cubic meters of natural gas to Europe every year, securing Europe’s energy supplies while stabilizing the world economy, including air travel,” the ambassador said. Azerbaijan’s economic potential is about much more than energy, said the article. Last year alone, the U.S. exported $434.2 million worth of products to Azerbaijan, while importing $142 million in goods, for a trade surplus of $292.2 million. American companies are exporting aircraft and heavy machinery to Azerbaijan while exploring investment opportunities in telecommunications and other non-energy sectors. Just as important as building oil rigs, Azerbaijan is helping America and its friends build bridges to the Islamic world, according to Suleymanov. As a predominantly Muslim society with a secular government, Azerbaijan is an example of pluralism and moderation, offering religious freedom for Islam, Christianity and Judaism. “For 1,400 years, our Jewish community, now numbering about 30,000, has lived alongside Muslims without antagonism or persecution. In 1918, Azerbaijan became the first majority-Muslim society to recognize women’s right to vote — two years before the entire U.S. (but eight years after Washington state),” he said. Participating in European institutions, including the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, as well as the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, which brings together 56 Muslim countries, Azerbaijan promotes mutual understanding, Suleymanov noted, adding that with close ties to the U.S., Israel, the European Union and the Muslim nations, we strive to transform divisiveness into dialogue.

The company said in a statement to Shanghai's stock exchange that it would buy 13 Boeing 787-9 passenger jets and six 737-8s, citing the continued "rapid growth" in China's travel market as incomes rise.

S. said this in an article published Herald net. “While offering economic opportunities and stabilizing energy supplies, Azerbaijan stands with the U.S. in struggling against terrorism and striving for a more peaceful world,” he said. The ambassador noted that the contract for the purchase of American aircraft helps support more than 12,000 workers at the assembly plant in Renton, which will increase production and ramp up hiring. In the highly cyclical aerospace industry, now suffering declining demand for widebody jets, Azerbaijan’s emergence as an export market for Boeing can counter pressures for further job losses, such as the recent layoffs of engineers. This is Azerbaijan’s third major investment in Boeing aircraft. In 2015, Silk Way purchased three Boeing 747-8 freighters manufactured at Boeing’s factory in Everett, with a total of 30,000 workers, according to Suleymanov. “That same year, Azerbaijan Airlines — our country’s flag carrier and largest airline — acquired its first Boeing 787 Dreamliner, assembled in South Carolina. Today, Azerbaijan Airlines Dreamliner (an aircraft built in both states) connect our countries via a nonstop Baku-New York flight. The ambassador said he is proud that Azerbaijan is contributing to a sector that supports some 252,800 jobs in Washington, with $21 billion in wages and nearly $95 billion in economic activity.  Azerbaijan’s partnership with the U.S. extends far beyond buying jetliners, he said. Bordering Iran and Russia, Azerbaijan is a trusted ally in a tough neighborhood. Within 24 hours of the September 11, 2001, attacks, Azerbaijan offered the U.S. unconditional support against terrorism, granting American military aircraft over-flights for a third of the non-lethal supplies for coalition forces, while Azerbaijani soldiers serve shoulder to shoulder with Americans in Afghanistan. “We continue to cooperate with the U.S. and its allies to combat terrorism, nuclear proliferation and narcotics trafficking. With 7 billion barrels of oil reserves and 30 trillion cubic feet of natural gas reserves, Azerbaijan provides about a million barrels of oil a day to Europe, as well as 40 percent of Israel’s consumption. Through the new Southern Gas Corridor pipeline network, Azerbaijan will also bring 16 billion cubic meters of natural gas to Europe every year, securing Europe’s energy supplies while stabilizing the world economy, including air travel,” the ambassador said. Azerbaijan’s economic potential is about much more than energy, said the article. Last year alone, the U.S. exported $434.2 million worth of products to Azerbaijan, while importing $142 million in goods, for a trade surplus of $292.2 million. American companies are exporting aircraft and heavy machinery to Azerbaijan while exploring investment opportunities in telecommunications and other non-energy sectors. Just as important as building oil rigs, Azerbaijan is helping America and its friends build bridges to the Islamic world, according to Suleymanov. As a predominantly Muslim society with a secular government, Azerbaijan is an example of pluralism and moderation, offering religious freedom for Islam, Christianity and Judaism. “For 1,400 years, our Jewish community, now numbering about 30,000, has lived alongside Muslims without antagonism or persecution. In 1918, Azerbaijan became the first majority-Muslim society to recognize women’s right to vote — two years before the entire U.S. (but eight years after Washington state),” he said. Participating in European institutions, including the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, as well as the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, which brings together 56 Muslim countries, Azerbaijan promotes mutual understanding, Suleymanov noted, adding that with close ties to the U.S., Israel, the European Union and the Muslim nations, we strive to transform divisiveness into dialogue.  --   Amina Nazarli is AzerNews’ staff journalist, follow her on Twitter: @amina_nazarli Follow us on Twitter @AzerNewsAz Category News President Aliyev receives UAE delegation [PHOTO] 10:27 Azerbaijan set to rival China in souvenir market 10:01 President Aliyev attends closing ceremony of Baku 2017 [PHOTO] 09:57 Mehriban Aliyeva: Azerbaijan’s hosting Baku 2017 is manifestation of Islamic world's respect to our country 22 May 22:00 Baku 2017 Islamic Solidarity Games important for sports promotion 22 May 21:13 Baku 2017 – an interesting show: Korean tourist 22 May 21:09 Closing Ceremony of Baku 2017 Islamic Solidarity Games 22 May 21:00 Ilham Aliyev receives UAE foreign minister 22 May 19:32 Azerbaijan, Turkey, Georgia to hold joint military drills 22 May 17:44 Romanian universities open doors for Azerbaijani students [PHOTO] 22 May 16:30 Latest Popular 11:00 • TAP to ensure more sustainable energy future for Europe 10:49 • FM: Attempts to violate internationally recognized borders inadmissible 10:42 • Iran says increasing oil output by 3 mb/d possible 10:37 • Shahin Novrasli – presented by legendary Ahmad Jamal in Paris [PHOTO] 10:29 • TAP to support 8 projects in Italian Salento 10:27 • President Aliyev receives UAE delegation [PHOTO] 10:18 • Theresa May calls Manchester Arena explosion 'an appalling terrorist attack' 10:12 • Currency rates for May 23 10:09 • Armenia attacks Azerbaijan’s positions, violates ceasefire 10:01 • Azerbaijan set to rival China in souvenir market 09:57 • President Aliyev attends closing ceremony of Baku 2017 [PHOTO] 09:44 • Explosion kills 19, wounds dozens more at Ariana Grande concert [PHOTO] 22 May 22:00 • Mehriban Aliyeva: Azerbaijan’s hosting Baku 2017 is manifestation of Islamic world's respect to our country 22 May 21:13 • Baku 2017 Islamic Solidarity Games important for sports promotion 22 May 21:09 • Baku 2017 – an interesting show: Korean tourist 22 May 21:00 • Closing Ceremony of Baku 2017 Islamic Solidarity Games 22 May 19:32 • Ilham Aliyev receives UAE foreign minister 22 May 18:45 • Turkmenistan sums up results of May 21 elections 22 May 18:23 • BSEC countries sign final declaration of Istanbul summit 22 May 18:13 • Expert: Armenia's occupation of Azerbaijani lands cause instability in S.Caucasus 22 May 11:39 • Official says early to speak about visa free regime between Azerbaijan, EU 22 May 12:42 • Azerbaijan helps U.S. to save thousands of jobs, ambassador says 22 May 13:43 • Russian FM: No one discredits memo on de-escalation zones in Syria 22 May 21:00 • Closing Ceremony of Baku 2017 Islamic Solidarity Games 22 May 17:44 • Azerbaijan, Turkey, Georgia to hold joint military drills 22 May 13:23 • SOCAR expands network of filling stations in Romania [PHOTO] 22 May 16:43 • Minister: Turkey, Azerbaijan may jointly invest in tourism of other countries 22 May 17:27 • Biggest gathering of foodies in Baku [PHOTO] 22 May 16:08 • President Aliyev receives EP delegation [UPDATE] 22 May 11:48 • More funds issued for sericulture development in Azerbaijan 22 May 17:15 • Azerbaijan tops medal standing as Islamic Solidarity Games end 22 May 15:16 • Azerbaijan's historical victory in Islamic Games football championship [PHOTO] 22 May 16:24 • Russia, Turkey agree on lifting of trade restrictions 22 May 18:45 • Turkmenistan sums up results of May 21 elections 22 May 16:42 • No problems observed in export of Azerbaijani tomatoes to Russia 22 May 17:47 • S&P: IBA's restructurization of debt has no effect on SOCAR ratings 22 May 12:13 • Lahij & mystery of the number 7 [PHOTO] 22 May 15:37 • Fantastic evening of jazz [PHOTO] 22 May 14:48 • Azerbaijani musician wins talent contest in Sweden [PHOTO/VIDEO] 22 May 17:58 • Rouhani vows to double non-oil export AzerNews Newspaper Facebook Twitter Google+ RSS Information About us Contacts Advertising Azernews In Print News Archive © 2017 AzerNews.

Private equity giant Blackstone (BX) on Saturday announced that Saudi Arabia would invest $20 billion in a new $40 billion infrastructure fund for projects mainly in the United States. On Sunday, Boeing (BA) said it had signed several defense and commercial deals with Saudi Arabia. Trump was referenced in both deal announcements. Blackstone, whose CEO Stephen Schwarzman is a close adviser to Trump and heads the president's business council, said Saturday's announcement is the culmination of "a year's discussions" between it and the Public Investment Fund of Saudi Arabia. "There is broad agreement that the United States urgently needs to invest in its rapidly aging infrastructure," said Blackston president Hamilton James in a statement, thanking Saudi Arabia for its "vote of confidence" in Blackstone and the United States. "This potential investment reflects our positive views around the ambitious infrastructure initiatives being undertaken in the United States as announced by President Trump," said H.E. Yasir Al Rumayyan, managing director of the Saudi Arabia fund, in a statement. Boeing said that President Trump, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Saudi Arabian leaders took part in a signing ceremony that included Boeing products and services. "These announcements reaffirm our commitment to the economic growth, prosperity and national security of both Saudi Arabia and the United States, helping to create or sustain thousands of jobs in our two countries," said Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg in a statement. Muilenburg has met with Trump on several occasions since the president's election. He reportedly listened in on a phone call Trump had with the CEO of rival Lockheed Martin (LMT) . He also reportedly convinced the president to support the Export-Import Bank. Billions of dollars in deals between U.S. and Saudi companies have been announced since Trump arrived in Riyadh on Saturday, marking his first stop on his first trip abroad since his inauguration. General Electric (GE) , Exxon (XOM) and Honeywell (HON) are among those to have announced or re-announced agreements. The Wall Street Journal estimates Saudi Arabia and the U.S are expected to agree to business deals and potential investments worth $300 billion over the course of Trump's visit. The White House reached a more than $100 billion arms deal with the Saudis ahead of the trip. "Tremendous investments in the United States," Trump said on Saturday, the first day of his two-day trip to Saudi Arabia, where on Sunday he delivered a speech on Islam. "Hundreds of billions of dollars of investments into the United States and jobs, jobs, jobs." The president heads to Tel Aviv next.

File Photo Shanghai, May 22, China’s Hainan Airlines, which has poured billions of dollars into overseas acquisitions, announced on Monday their plans to buy 19 Boeing aircrafts for USD 4.2 billion to help meet the skyrocketing travel demands by Chinese consumers. The company said in a statement to Shanghai’s stock exchange that it would buy 13 Boeing 787-9 passenger jets and six 737-8s, citing the continuous “rapid growth” in China’s travel market with rise in income. It plans to issue 15 billion yuan (USD 2.18 billion) in bonds to help fund the deal. Chinese airlines have seen booming business in recent years, with a rush to expand their fleets and route networks amid growth that the International Air Transport Association (IATA) predicts will take China past the United States to become the world’s largest air-travel market by 2024. Hainan Airlines and its parent HNA Group have been among the most acquisitive players in a wave of overseas investments by Chinese companies in recent years. HNA is a sprawling conglomerate with interests in aviation and tourism. Last year alone, HNA purchased Brazil’s third largest airline Azul, Swiss airline catering company gategroup, and stakes in Virgin Australia airline and Portuguese national airline TAP. Plans to buy the US-based aircraft leasing business, CIT Group Inc. for USD 10 billion was announced in October by a unit held privately by the HNA. The Chinese government had encouraged companies to invest overseas to open up new markets. Many companies obliged, pouring billions into overseas purchases to such an extent that Chinese authorities became worried over capital flight and the impact on the slumping yuan currency. The government has since reversed course, denouncing “irrational” investment abroad and putting restrictions on fund outflows.

The announcement is the latest in tens of billions of dollars in deals signed between U.S. and Saudi firms since Trump arrived in Riyadh on Saturday. Boeing said Saudi Arabia has agreed to buy Chinook heli co pters, associated support services and guided weapons systems, and intends to purchase P-8 surveillance aircraft. The total value of the deals or how many aircraft Saudi Arabia intends to buy was not given in the statement announcing the agreements. A Boeing spokesman declined to co mment beyond the statement. The U.S State Department announced in December plans to sell Saudi Arabia CH-47F Chinook cargo heli co pters and related equipment, training and support worth $3.51 billion. Saudi Arabia is seeking closer defense and co mmercial ties with the United States under Trump, as it seeks to develop its e co nomy beyond oil and leads a co alition that is fighting a war in Yemen. “These announcements reaffirm our co mmitment to the e co nomic growth, prosperity and national security of both Saudi Arabia and the United States, helping to create or sustain thousands of jobs in our two co untries,” said Boeing Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg. For more on Trump in Saudi Arabia, watch Fortune's video: Boeing also said it would negotiate the sale of up to 16 widebody airplanes to Saudi Gulf Airlines which is based in the co untry's east in Dammam. Boeing did not say which aircraft it was negotiating to sell to the privately-owned co mmercial airline. Saudi Gulf, which started operations last year, co uld not immediately be reached for co mment. Boeing will also establish a joint venture with Saudi Arabia to provide "sustainment services for a wide range of military platforms," the statement said, whilst a separate joint venture would "provide support for both military and co mmercial heli co pters."

The company said Wednesday that it still plans to deliver the first Boeing 737 Max later this month, and production will continue. A Boeing 737 MAX 9 under construction at the company's production facility in Renton, Washington, on Feb. 13. Jason Redmond / Reuters file The news sent Boeing Co. shares down nearly 4 percent, although they recovered partly to close at $183.18, down $2.31, or 1.3 percent. Chicago-based Boeing was notified last week of a potential issue involving turbine engine discs produced by a supplier to engine maker CFM International. Boeing said it has not experienced any problems with the discs during more than 2,000 hours of testing. It poses no safety concerns for travelers because no airlines are yet flying the 737 Max but it could mean a costly disruption if the problem persists. Timely delivery is important to planemakers as they get most of the payment for a plane when it is handed to the buyer. The Max is designed to be a more fuel-efficient version of the workhorse 737, Boeing's most popular commercial plane. Malaysia's Malindo Air plans to take delivery of the first Max in a few days and begin using it for passenger flights before July. Dallas-based Southwest Airlines Co. expects to begin using the plane this fall. It said Boeing had not warned it of any delays to its delivery schedule. Related: China's 'Homegrown' Competitor to 737 Takes to the Skies American Airlines Group Inc., which has 100 737 MAX jets on order, declined to comment when contacted by Reuters. The discs in question are made by a supplier to CFM International, a joint venture of General Electric and France's Safran. GE spokeswoman Jamie Jewell declined to identify the supplier. She said GE and Safran will work with the supplier to find and correct any shortcomings in the manufacturing process while also turning to a backup supplier to keep production of engines on schedule. A Boeing logo on one of the firm's 737 Max 9 jets. Jason Redmond / AFP - Getty Images file In a written statement, Boeing said it will work with CFM "to understand the precise scope and root cause of the quality issue." New planes and parts go through extensive testing to turn up problems before passengers go on board. Cai von Rumohr, an analyst with Cowen and Co., said "this doesn't look like a serious concern" because Boeing still expects to deliver the first plane this month and it appears to be a fixable manufacturing problem rather than a design flaw. Boeing has built about 9,500 single-aisle 737s since the late 1960s. The company said it has taken more than 3,700 orders for the Max, which carries a list price of $112.4 million to $119.2 million, although airlines routinely get big discounts.

EVERETT — The Boeing Co. issued more layoff notices Friday, as the aerospace giant continues trimming its workforce. At least 281 workers were told they will be out of a job by late July. The company laid off 249 members of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers and 32 members of the Society of Professional Engineering Employees in Aerospace. A Boeing spokesman declined to say how many non-union employees were laid off. The company has to give laid-off workers 60-days warning ahead of their last day of work, which would be July 21 for employees notified Friday. If enough other employees retire or otherwise leave Boeing before then, the company may choose to not follow through on the layoff notices. “We continue to follow the plan outlined to employees last December,” Boeing spokesman Paul Bergman said. “Employment reductions, which includes managers and executives, will come through a combination of attrition, leaving open positions unfilled, a voluntary layoff program and in some cases, involuntary layoffs. All information is being shared directly with employees.” Boeing’s workforce has dropped by more than 13,600 since the beginning of 2016. Those cuts have hit heaviest around Puget Sound, where the company’s payroll has been slashed from 79,238 at the beginning of 2016 to 70,640 by the end of March 2017, the most recent data available on the company’s website. That is a decrease of 8,598 jobs. Over the first three months of this year, the number of Boeing jobs in Washington fell by 1,241. Company leaders have said they plan to trim Boeing’s workforce this year as much as they did last year. In 2016, Boeing’s Washington workforce dropped by 7,357 jobs — a 9.3 percent reduction — through a combination of leaving open positions unfilled, buyouts and layoffs. “Unfortunately, we expect the layoffs to continue,” said Bill Dugovich, a spokesman for the Society of Professional Engineering Employees in Aerospace, the white-collar union representing engineers and technical workers around Puget Sound.

REUTERS/Fabian Bimmer Reuters/Fabian Bimmer 23 May 2017 RIYADH – Several defense and commercial agreements announced Saturday (May 20) will further strengthen Boeing’s partnership with Saudi Arabia, create or sustain thousands of jobs in both the United States and Saudi Arabia, and enhance national security in the region. US President Donald Trump and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson were joined by the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques King Salman Bin Abdul-Aziz Al Saud, Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Naif Al Saud and Deputy Crown Prince Mohammad Bin Salman Al Saud at a signing ceremony that included Boeing products and services. Among the announcements: • Agreements to purchase Chinook helicopters and associated support services as well as guided weapon systems. • Saudi Arabia’s intent to order P-8 maritime, patrol and reconnaissance aircraft, which are based on the Boeing 737 commercial airplane. Advertisement • A joint venture with the Kingdom to provide sustainment services for a wide range of military platforms. The agreement also supports Saudi Arabia’s efforts to grow its indigenous aerospace industry and ecosystem through its Vision 2030 initiative. • A commercial registration certificate for the Saudi Rotorcraft Support Company, a newly formed joint venture between Boeing, Alsalam Aerospace Industries and Saudia Aerospace Engineering Industries with bases in both Riyadh and Jeddah that will provide support for both military and commercial helicopters. • An agreement between Boeing and SaudiGulf Airlines to negotiate the sale of up to 16 widebody airplanes. “These announcements reaffirm our commitment to the economic growth, prosperity and national security of both Saudi Arabia and the United States, helping to create or sustain thousands of jobs in our two countries,” said Boeing Chairman, President and CEO Dennis Muilenburg, who also participated in the Saudi-U.S. CEO Forum. “Our decades-long partnership with the Kingdom began in 1945 when President Roosevelt presented a DC-3 to King Abdul Aziz Al Saud, launching commercial air travel in the region. We welcome the opportunity to continue that support. I appreciate the efforts of King Salman, President Trump and his administration to support American manufacturers as we seek to grow at home and around the world,” he added. © The Saudi Gazette 2017 © Copyright Zawya.

Boeing said Saudi Arabia agreed to buy Chinook helicopters, associated support services and guided weapons systems, and intends to purchase P-8 surveillance aircraft. The US State Department in December announced plans to sell Saudi Arabia CH-47F Chinook cargo helicopters and related equipment, training and support worth $3.51 billion. Congress was informed last year that a sale to Saudi Arabia would involve 48 of the helicopters. Saudi Arabia is seeking closer defence and commercial ties with the United States under Trump, as it seeks to develop its economy beyond oil. The total value of the deals was not disclosed in a statement announcing the agreements. The Boeing announcement is the latest in business deals worth tens of billions of dollars signed between US and Saudi companies since Trump arrived in Riyadh on Saturday. “These announcements reaffirm our commitment to the economic growth, prosperity and national security of both Saudi Arabia and the United States, helping to create or sustain thousands of jobs in our two countries,” said Boeing Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg. Boeing also said it would negotiate the sale of up to 16 widebody airplanes to Saudi Gulf Airlines, which is based in the country’s east in Dammam. A sale to the privately owned commercial airline is expected to include Boeing 777 and or 787 aircraft, according to a person familiar with the matter. Saudi Gulf, which started operations last year, could not be reached immediately for comment. Boeing also will establish a joint venture with Saudi Arabia to provide “sustainment services for a wide range of military platforms,” the statement said, including non-Boeing supplied equipment. A separate joint venture would “provide support for both military and commercial helicopters.” The Saudi Rotorcraft Support Centre recently received its commercial certificate and is expected to start operations in the near future. The centre is a joint venture with Alsalam Aerospace Industries, Saudi Aerospace Engineering Industries and Boeing.— Reuters About the author View all articles by Oman Observer ← Saudi oil minister visits Iraq to discuss oil cut extension Bank Muscat launches attractive Ramadhan Sayyarati auto finance offer → ← Previous Next → Search Recent Posts Recent 19 killed in suicide attack at Ariana Grande concert in Manchester HM approves education philosophy Oman, Japan cooperation EDUCATION COUNCIL MEETING Read More ...

Their stocks advanced on Monday in the wake of announcements of arms sales to the kingdom that could be worth $109 billion over the next decade, one of the largest-ever deals of its kind. If certain conditions are met, the proceeds could be worth more than $300 billion. Beneficiaries of the Saudi Arabian sale include Lockheed Martin (LMT), the world's largest defense contractor, whose shares rose $4.24, or 1.6 percent, to $277.03; Boeing (BA), the No. 2 defense company, which rose $2.91, or 1.6 percent, to $183.67; and Raytheon (RTN), the largest maker of missiles and a key player in defense electronics, which edged up 91 cents, almost 1 percent, to $161.19. Saudi Arabia imported $3 billion worth of U.S. arms last year, the most of any country. It isn't clear, however, how much of the new deal is firm, and analysts say it'll take years for the companies to profit from them. Some of these contracts have also been previously announced. Play Video CBS Evening News Rare look at the new F-35 fighter jet The Marine version of the F-35 is in final testing. CBS News correspondent David Martin got a first hand look at this complex new fighter jet. "I think it's a plus," said Cai von Rumohr, an analyst with Cowen & Co. who follows the industry. "Pretty clearly, they liked the fact that Trump seems to favor them over Iran. The odds that all of these things ultimately turn into sales downstream has to be better than it was [previously]. ....Certainly, the fact that the Saudis were willing to make those announcements was significant." Saudi Arabia has "expressed its intent" to purchase $28 billion worth of weapons systems from Lockheed Martin, including 150 Sikorsky helicopters, the THAAD missile defense system and four littoral combat ships (used for near-shore operations), according to the company. The oil-rich kingdom also plans to acquire Boeing Chinook helicopters, P-8 maritime patrol and reconnaissance aircraft, guided weapon systems and 16 widebody commercial aircraft for SaudiGulf Airlines. Raytheon, which has done business in the Middle East for more than five decades, plans to form Raytheon Arabia, a "Saudi legal entity" that will create "indigenous defense, aerospace and security capabilities in the Kingdom" in areas like cybersecurity, smart munitions and missile defense. The Saudi Arabian deal could lead to additional sales for both Israel and the Persian Gulf countries, all of which are concerned with Iran's aggressive foreign policy and its support for terrorist groups in the region. Israel is the largest recipient of U.S. military aid, while the Gulf countries are big spenders on weapons, reaching $33 billion last year. The latter countries also lack a significant arms industry of their own. "This is a very large transaction," said Loren Thompson, head of the Lexington Institute think tank who also does consulting work for the industry. "There is always a quid pro quo when we do Arab arms sales to make certain that Israel preserves its military edge. In all likelihood that means the Israelis will get a larger contribution of F-35 fighters, which are operationally superior to anything other countries in the region have." Other U.S. companies also announced new business from Saudi Arabia during Mr. Trump's visit. General Electric (GE), which also has a significant defense business, announced $15 billion worth of deals in a variety of sectors including energy and health care. Exxon Mobil (XOM), the world's largest publicly traded oil company, along with other energy companies signed $50 billion in deals with Saudia Aramco, the state-run oil company. © 2017 CBS Interactive Inc..

Saudi Arabia is seeking closer defence and commercial ties with the United States under Trump, as it seeks to develop its economy beyond oil and leads a coalition that is fighting a war in Yemen. Saudi Arabia is seeking to end Iran-allied Houthi control over most of Yemen’s main population centres and restore its internationally recognized government to power. The total value of the deals was not disclosed in a statement announcing the agreements. The Boeing announcement is the latest in business deals worth tens of billions of dollars signed between US and Saudi companies since Trump arrived in Riyadh on Saturday. “These announcements reaffirm our commitment to the economic growth, prosperity and national security of both Saudi Arabia and the United States, helping to create or sustain thousands of jobs in our two countries,” said Boeing Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg.

Two Indiana companies are assisting Boeing in the construction of what can best be described as a space taxi. Major Tool and Machine and Imagineering Finishing Technologies are designing the upper dome of a craft, which will be used to carry astronauts to space. Boeing is building the spacecraft with the hope that someday it can be used for commercial flights. Joel Manship is the Vice President of Business Development for Major Tool and Machine in Indianapolis. He says that the program is currently focused on assisting NASA and governmental programs, and he’s excited to see where the program goes from here. When the domes are finished, Major Tool will ship it to Imagineering Finishing Technologies in South Bend. There, the domes are inspected under a black light and crews apply a protective coating before being sent to Cape Canaveral in Florida. The two Indiana companies have already built and finished two of the domes.

VSAT, -0.47% a global broadband services and technology company, announced today it received a contract from The Boeing Company BA, +1.61% to deliver its KOR-24A Small Tactical Terminals (STT) for integration onto Boeing's AV-8B Harrier attack aircraft for United States Marine Corps (USMC) and international customers. The contract is worth approximately $20M including exercisable options. The STT was competitively selected as providing the best value to Boeing and its U.S. Government customer based upon its capability, product maturity and proven reliability as the only small form factor Link 16 and Soldier Radio Waveform (SRW) capable aviation terminal fielded in the world. The STT will enable the USMC's Harriers to better coordinate their activities with other U.S. and allied aircraft as well as with U.S. and allied ground forces using both Link 16 and SRW networks in order to more rapidly engage enemy targets and to do so with reduced risk of fratricide or collateral damage. "Being selected by Boeing to provide the Link 16 radio for the AV-8B is another big milestone for us," said Ken Peterman, president, Government Systems, ViaSat. "It is further evidence of the value of our STT product as well as our commercial approach to developing products to provide our warfighters with the capability they need to address their critical gaps with little or no investment necessary by the government customer.  This order from Boeing for the Harrier increases the quantities of STTs either in the field or on order to well over 1,200 units; and we anticipate a market with at least several thousand additional units to follow."

Like Alan Mulally, the Boeing executive who became Ford CEO before the financial crisis and steered the carmaker through its most challenging episode, Hackett has no prior experience in the auto industry. He was CEO of furniture manufacturer Steelcase, but he has a close relationship with Ford Chairman Bill Ford and has a reputation for advanced thinking about business and the future.  He had been Chairman of Ford Smart Mobility, the company's forward-looking division, designed to keep pace with the Tesla and Ubers of the world. Fields, by contrast, was a consummate insider, a Ford veteran with nearly 30 years under his belt. With a background in sales and marketing, he forged a tight relationship with Mulally and learned to pull in his sharp elbows. As CEO, he was smooth and suave, but he also had to serve two masters: the ongoing disruption of the auto industry; and Ford's core business, which was hugely profitable. He did a decent job with the Silicon Valley geekery, but he also had to please Ford's dealers and the "car guys" in the company — the designers, engineers, and executives who prize the company's leadership role in SUVs and pickups and who cherish the legacy of the Mustang muscle car. View photos Ford ChartMore The traditional business was performing well for Ford, and Fields presided over record yearly profits and booming sales. But Wall Street is more interested in high-risk bets on emerging technologies and penalized Ford's stock price accordingly. Under Fields, is had slipped 30%. Tesla, meanwhile, passed Ford in market cap as its stock surged to new heights. Ford can't fund the future without sustaining the past. Fields had the youth and energy to propel the company forward, but he couldn't devote himself entirely to talk of Ford's self-disruption. The company's new management structure seems designed to alleviate this burden and effectively create an Old Ford and New Ford. Several of Fields lieutenants will now take charge of the auto business while Hackett will presumably be able to push for more rapid change on the Smart Mobility front. Fields had an increasingly impossible job, but he never actually looked like he was breaking a sweat. He didn't really fail; rather, he simply had to run a 100-year-old-plus company while the markets fixated on new players who promised to be the Fords of the 21st century. This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Business Insider. More From Business Insider It's Wall Street vs. Detroit — and with Mark Fields out at Ford, Wall Street is winning Wall Street is freaking out about a 'Motown Slowdown' — but the US auto industry is actually in fantastic shape Ford’s first electric SUV could have an edge on Tesla's Model Y Reblog Share Tweet Share Recently Viewed Your list is empty.

The company said in a statement to the Shanghai Stock Exchange that it would buy 13 Boeing 787-9 passenger jets and six 737-8 planes, citing the continued “rapid growth” in China’s travel market as incomes rise. It plans to issue 15 billion yuan (US$2.2 billion) in bonds to help fund the deal. Chinese airlines have seen booming business in recent years, rushing to expand their fleets and route networks amid growth that the International Air Transport Association predicts will take China past the US to become the world’s largest air-travel market by 2024. Hainan Airlines and its parent HNA Group have been among the most acquisitive players in a wave of overseas investments by Chinese companies in recent years.

"The commentary on what happened in Saudi Arabia, most of it, was good. Because we were down last week because of political news the inverse is true too: that nothing bad happened over the weekend in political news."At 10:47 a.m. ET (1447 GMT) the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 79.39 points, or 0.38 percent, at 20,884.23, the S&P 500 was up 7.16 points, or 0.30 percent, at 2,388.89 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 31.16 points, or 0.51 percent, at 6,114.86.Gains were broad based, with nine of the 11 S&P sectors trading higher, led by the tech sector's 0.55 and industrials index's 0.50 percent rise. Boeing was the biggest boost on the Dow. Amazon's near 1 percent rise was the biggest positive influence on the S&P and the Nasdaq.Forrest said that while strong earnings and mostly positive economic data will help provide support, the market will continue to be susceptible in the near term to political developments and what it means for Trump's agenda for tax cuts and higher infrastructure spending.Also bolstering the market was a 1 percent gain in oil prices due to confidence that top exporters will this week agree to extend supply curbs, or even be deepen cuts. Ford was up 1.7 percent at $11.05 after the automaker named James Hackett, who heads its unit developing self-driving cars, as chief executive, responding to investors' growing unease about its stock price and prospects.Berkshire Hathaway was up about 0.8 percent after Barron's said on Saturday the conglomerate's stock could see double digit gains over the next year and a half even if Chairman Warren Buffett decided to retire.Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,798 to 938. On the Nasdaq, 1,621 issues rose and 999 fell.The S&P 500 index showed 31 new 52-week highs and one new low, while the Nasdaq recorded 74 new highs and 24 new lows.

Photo: AFP Paris/Seattle: Two words underpin The Boeing Co.’s decision to launch a US trade complaint against Bombardier Inc., which plunged it into a row with Canada last week: “Never again”. Allegations that the Canadian firm dumped newly designed CSeries aircraft in the US at a steep loss have threatened a sale of F/A-18 warplanes to Ottawa, sending Boeing scrambling to save the deal. Some analysts say Boeing carelessly put at risk billions of dollars of defence work or pandered to growing protectionism. But decades after Boeing failed to prevent European upstart Airbus gaining momentum with early victories in the US, people familiar with the company say the strategic importance of defending its core passenger jet business outweighs the diplomatic storm. US industry experts say Boeing and other jetmakers at the time did not take the European consortium seriously enough and allowed their future nemesis to poach US airlines from 1978. Again after the September 2001 attacks in the US, when Boeing slashed production, Airbus filled the vacuum, building up market share and never looking back. For years Boeing insiders have rued that decision, even while battling Airbus at the World Trade Organization (WTO) over mutual accusations of unfair subsidies. While leading in wide-body jets, it has seen the narrowbody market — where the industry makes most cash — slip away as Airbus grabbed some 60% of new-generation sales. Such a significant imbalance in market share poses serious long-term risk to the loser in the Airbus-Boeing duopoly, because it creates a gap in costs that can’t easily be bridged. Now, Boeing sees a second rival entering its domestic market with what it sees as low prices and is determined not to underestimate the threat again, people close to the company say. “It’s a crucial entry market,” said a person familiar with Boeing’s strategy in taking on Bombardier. “This is the case Boeing might have brought against Airbus 40 years ago. Not taking action at the start led to consequences.” On the surface, Boeing’s case is about the sale of jets to Delta Air Lines at what Boeing claims were unfairly low prices. Bombardier denies Boeing’s estimates of both the price and the cost at which it is able to make its new jet, while critics say Boeing accounting rules allow it to disguise weak pricing. While the high-profile deal ignited Boeing’s complaint, executives say Boeing’s stance reflects a longer-term concern. Although Bombardier’s small narrow-body jet has so far barely scratched Boeing’s larger 737 and has suffered a spate of financial problems, the all-new design disturbs a landscape made up mainly by makeovers of existing Airbus and Boeing models. With Airbus still well ahead on narrowbody orders even after a recent lull, Boeing can ill afford to be squeezed on two fronts. Even less so with new players like China arriving. A Boeing spokesman declined to comment. Precision trade weapon Boeing’s response marries strategic worries about its narrow-body position with a legal tactic designed to exploit a vulnerability the CSeries has, but global rival Airbus did not. The 110-130 seat CSeries relies mainly for now on the regional jet market, where North America is by far the largest single component and whose airlines therefore decide its future. That hands Boeing the opportunity to make use of a domestic lawsuit ill-suited to its global confrontation with Airbus, but which if successful could deliver a hammer blow to the CSeries. Trade sources see a second tactical motive for spurning the WTO and filing the industry’s first such domestic US case. US anti-dumping cases typically take a year - versus 13 years and counting in its trench warfare against Airbus. That coincides with first delivery of a CSeries to Delta in April 2018. If Boeing succeeds, the jets could be hit from day one with extra duties, blunting Bombardier’s competitiveness more quickly and more directly than normal trade sanctions. Still, Boeing faces a headache over what to do about lost fighter sales if Canada makes good on a threat to drop a deal for F/A-18 warplanes in retaliation for Boeing’s trade claim. With Boeing’s future fighter production in jeopardy as sales run dry, Boeing is anxious to keep its presence in that business long enough to compete for tomorrow’s military programmes. But without stability in its narrow-body jetliner business, Boeing faces an even deeper concern, since this is the cash cow for many of the company’s other activities. Sources says Boeing’s defence bosses signed off on bringing the trade case, highlighting the importance attached to the 737. The broader stakes raised by Bombardier’s foray into the US market were underscored when China was reported to revive on-off talks to invest in Bombardier. Airbus itself weighed buying the CSeries before talks collapsed in 2015. Whoever wins the trade spat between Bombardier and Boeing, one thing is clear: the small jet from Montreal has made its mark on the strategic calculations of all industry rivals, and now faces a battle for new sales.

The S&P 500 and the Dow added 0.5% and 0.4%, respectively, while the Nasdaq (+0.8%) settled a step ahead of its peers. The benchmark index dropped 44 points, or 1.8%, last Wednesday in response to a New York Times article that accused President Trump of asking former FBI Director James Comey to shut down the Bureau's investigation of former National Security adviser Michael Flynn. However, since the tumble, the S&P 500 has reclaimed all but seven points of the loss, as the buy-the-dip trade has prevailed once again. Ten of eleven sectors settled in positive territory on Monday with the technology (+1.0%) and utilities (+0.9%) spaces leading the charge. The technology group was underpinned by large-cap names like Microsoft (MSFT 68.45, +0.76), Alphabet (GOOGL 964.07, +9.42), and Qualcomm (QCOM 59.28, +1.61) with QCOM showing relative strength (+2.8%) after the company's stock was upgraded to 'Overweight' from 'Neutral' at JP Morgan. QCOM's positive performance rubbed off on its semiconductor peers, evidenced by the 1.1% increase in the PHLX Semiconductor Index. The industrial sector also finished ahead of the broader market, thanks in part to defense names like Boeing (BA 183.67, +2.91) and Lockheed Martin (LMT 277.03, +4.24). The two names added 1.6% apiece following a weekend meeting between President Trump and King Salman of Saudi Arabia, which included the signing of a $110 billion arms deal. The consumer staples (+0.6%) and consumer discretionary (+0.6%) sectors also outperformed. Most of the remaining sectors finished with modest gains between 0.1% and 0.3%. However, the energy sector (-0.2%) settled in negative territory despite crude oil's positive performance. The energy component jumped 0.9% to $51.14/bbl as investors displayed confidence that top oil producers will extend the original OPEC/non-OPEC production cut agreement by six to nine months when they meet in Vienna on Thursday. In addition to pushing back the end date, reports indicate that producers may increase the magnitude of the supply cuts. In U.S. corporate news, Ford Motor (F 11.10, +0.23) officially announced that Jim Hackett will replace Mark Fields as the company's Chief Executive Officer on Monday morning. According to a Wall Street Journal report that was released earlier this month, Ford's Board of Directors has been looking to refine the company's strategy in response to a declining market share and a disappointing stock performance. Ford shares lost around 36.0% of their value during Mr. Fields' time as CEO. U.S. Treasuries settled slightly lower across the board with the benchmark 10-yr yield climbing two basis points to 2.25%. Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar lost 0.3% against the euro (1.1240) after German Chancellor Angela Merkel said the single currency is too weak.

The benchmark index currently sports a gain of 0.5%.  The Dow Jones Transportation Average (+0.8%) trades a step ahead of the benchmark index today amid broad strength from its components. Avis Budget (CAR 23.81, +1.46) is the DJTA's top-performer while airlines like JetBlue Airways (JBLU 21.57, +0.29), Southwest Airlines (LUV 58.95, +0.91), and United Continental (UAL 79.00, +1.02) also show relative strength.  Read More Meanwhile, the small-cap Russell 2000 (+0.4%) has struggled to keep pace with the broader market as names like Advanced Micro Devices (AMD 10.92, -0.49), Chemours (CC 43.16, -0.68), Olin (OLN 30.95, -0.25), LogMeln (LOGM 111.15, -1.90), and Exelixis (EXEL 19.08, -0.61) weigh.

Cisco Systems (CSCO 31.84, +0.63) is the top-performing Dow component this afternoon, up 2.0%. However, despite today's positive performance, the company still sits 5.9% below last Wednesday's closing level. CSCO shares plunged to a three-month low last Thursday in reaction to the company's latest earnings report. In the commodity market, metals finished Monday higher across the board. Silver ($17.19/ozt) jumped 2.3% while gold ($1,261.50/ozt) and copper ($2.60/lb) added 0.6% and 0.8%, respectively. 1:25 pm: [BRIEFING.COM] The major averages hover at their best levels of the day with the S&P 500 up 0.5%. Given its current level, the benchmark index has retraced all but seven points of last Wednesday's dive, which represented the sharpest one-day decline since last September. Last Wednesday's swoon occurred just days after the S&P 500 closed at an all-time high of 2402.32, but the buy-the-dip response that followed has put the market within a striking distance of a fresh record yet again. Today has been largely uneventful for the bond market, where Treasuries hold slim losses with the 10-yr yield up one basis point at 2.25%. The benchmark yield has spent the entire session bouncing between 2.24% and 2.25%. 1:00 pm: [BRIEFING.COM] The stock market is cruising towards its third consecutive win this afternoon with the major averages holding gains across the board. The tech-heavy Nasdaq (+0.7%) leads the S&P 500 (+0.5%) and the Dow (+0.4%) as tech stocks generally outperform. Ten of eleven sectors trade in positive territory this afternoon with the technology group (+0.8%) showing relative strength. The tech sector has been underpinned by large-cap names like Alphabet (GOOGL 962.71, +8.06), Microsoft (MSFT 68.24, +0.55), Cisco Systems (CSCO 31.76, +0.55), and Qualcomm (QCOM 59.94, +1.26). Of these four companies, QCOM holds the widest advance, adding 2.2%, after the company's shares were upgraded to 'Overweight' from 'Neutral' at JP Morgan this morning. QCOM's positive performance has rubbed off on its semiconductor peers, evidenced by the 0.7% increase in the PHLX Semiconductor Index. Like technology, the industrial sector (+0.7%) also trades ahead of the broader market, thanks in part to defense names like Boeing (BA 183.45, +2.71) and Lockheed Martin (LMT 277.17, +4.38). The two names are up 1.5% apiece following a weekend meeting between President Trump and King Salman of Saudi Arabia, which included the signing of a $110 billion arms deal. The utilities sector also outperforms, trading higher by 0.7%. In U.S. corporate news, Ford Motor (F 11.04, +0.18) officially announced that Jim Hackett will replace Mark Fields as the company's Chief Executive Officer this morning. According to a Wall Street Journal report that was released earlier this month, Ford's Board of Directors has been looking to refine the company's strategy in response to a declining market share and a disappointing stock performance. Ford shares have tumbled around 36.0% since Mr. Fields took over as CEO on July 1, 2014. Today, Ford trades higher by 1.7%, which makes it one of the consumer discretionary sector's (+0.5%) top-performing components. Amazon (AMZN 969.65, +9.85) has also helped the consumer discretionary space, adding 1.0%, as have retailers, evidenced by the 0.7% increase in the SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT 41.42, +0.28). Outside of energy, the remaining sectors trade in positive territory with modest gains between 0.1% (telecom services) and 0.6% (consumer staples). The energy sector is down 0.1% this afternoon, which is somewhat surprising given crude oil's positive performance. The energy component is up 0.8% at $51.05/bbl as investors display confidence that top oil producers will extend the original OPEC/non-OPEC production cut agreement by six to nine months when they meet in Vienna on Thursday. In addition to pushing back the end date, reports indicate that producers may increase the magnitude of the supply cuts. In the bond market, U.S. Treasuries trade slightly lower with the benchmark 10-yr yield climbing one basis point to 2.25%. Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar is down 0.2% against the euro (1.1233) after German Chancellor Angela Merkel said the single currency is too weak. Investors did not receive any economic data on Monday. 12:35 pm: [BRIEFING.COM] The major averages have ticked up in recent action with the S&P 500 (+0.5%) climbing to a fresh session high. Ten of eleven sectors trade in positive territory with the energy group (-0.1%) being the only exception. The technology (+0.8%) and industrials (+0.7%) sectors have maintained their spots at the top of today's leaderboard while the financial (+0.5%) space has moved in line with the benchmark index after showing weakness earlier in the session. However, some of the most influential financial components trade behind the broader market. Wells Fargo (WFC 52.90, -0.16) is down 0.3% while JPMorgan Chase (JPM 84.95, +0.17) and Bank of America (BAC 23.09, +0.04) hold modest gains of 0.2% apiece.  In Europe, the major bourses finished Monday mixed with the UK's FTSE adding 0.3%, France's CAC settling near its flat line, and Germany's DAX posting a loss of 0.2%. The euro (1.1235) has climbed 0.2% against the U.S. dollar to a fresh eight-month high after German Chancellor Angela Merkel said the single currency is too weak. Eurozone monetary policy will be up for debate in a couple of weeks when the European Central Bank meets on June 8. 12:00 pm: [BRIEFING.COM] Range-bound action continues with the S&P 500 (+0.4%) staying true to a five-point range since today's opening bell. The top-weighted technology sector (+0.7%) has had a strong showing this morning, underpinned by large-cap names like Alphabet (GOOGL 962.32, +7.76), Cisco Systems (CSCO 31.62, +0.41), and Qualcomm (QCOM 59.16, +1.49). Of these three companies, QCOM holds the widest advance, adding 2.6%, after the company's shares were upgraded to 'Overweight' from 'Neutral' at JP Morgan earlier this morning. QCOM's positive performance has rubbed off on its semiconductor peers, evidenced by the 0.9% increase in the PHLX Semiconductor Index. Chipmakers are having a solid month with the PHLX Semiconductor Index currently holding a month-to-date gain of 6.3%. The positive performance has a lot to do with NVIDIA (NVDA 138.37, +2.39), which has spiked over 34.0% since releasing its latest earnings report on May 9. The company beat earnings and revenue estimates in addition to providing upbeat guidance. 11:25 am: [BRIEFING.COM] The major U.S. indices have not changed since the last update with the S&P 500 clinging to a modest gain of 0.3%. Meanwhile, the small-cap Russell 2000 (+0.3%) trades in line with the broader market. Energy stocks are under pressure today despite crude oil climbing to a fresh one-month high. The commodity is up 1.1% at $51.23/bbl as investors display confidence that top oil producers will extend the original OPEC/non-OPEC production cut agreement by six to nine months when they meet in Vienna on Thursday. In addition to pushing back the end date, reports indicate that producers may increase the magnitude of the supply cuts.  The energy sector trades at the bottom of the sector standings with a loss of 0.4%. The financials (unch), telecom services (-0.1%), materials (unch), and real estate (unch) groups also underperform. 11:00 am: [BRIEFING.COM] The major averages hover modestly higher this morning with the Nasdaq (+0.5%) holding the largest gain. Earlier this morning, Ford Motor (F 11.06, +0.19) officially announced that Jim Hackett will replace Mark Fields as the company's Chief Executive Officer. According to the Wall Street Journal, Ford's Board of Directors has been looking to refine the company's strategy in response to a declining market share and a disappointing stock performance. Ford shares have tumbled 36.0% since Mr. Fields took over as CEO on July 1, 2014. Ford trades higher by 1.7%, making it one of the top-performing components in the consumer discretionary sector (+0.5%).

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it Bill Ford Jr., right, executive chairman of Ford Motor Co., introduces Jim Hackett as chief executive in Dearborn, Mich., on Monday. (Paul Sancya/Associated Press) By Thomas Heath and Jena McGregor By Thomas Heath and Jena McGregor May 22 at 4:55 PM Follow @addedvalueth Follow @jenamcgregor Ford Motor Co. on Monday replaced its chief executive as the 114-year-old auto giant gears up to compete with Silicon Valley upstarts such as Tesla in the coming revolution in smart driving. Mark Fields retired after 28 years at the company. He was replaced by former Steelcase chief Jim Hackett, a longtime furniture executive who had almost zero experience in automobiles until he joined the company last year to head its “smart mobility” transportation initiative. “We need speed [in] decision-making,” Ford Chairman Bill Ford Jr. said in a Wall Street Journal interview. Ford, the great-grandson of company founder Henry Ford, said he expects the 62-year-old Hackett to be in the job “for a good, long time.” Ford earned more than $25 billion in profit in the past four years, helped largely by the surging U.S. auto and truck market. But the auto icon is reeling from several challenges, including a stock price that has plummeted more than 30 percent since Fields took over three years ago from Alan Mulally, a former Boeing executive known as an approachable executive who encouraged candor among his direct reports. “The main issue is the underperformance of the stock price,” said Ivan Feinseth, chief investment officer at Tigress Financial Partners. “I didn’t think that Mark Fields was a bad CEO. But the net result is that the stock is down in an up market. The stock is down in a period of up auto sales. There is nothing that will limit CEO longevity more than a stock price that is down in an up market.” (Reuters) Traditional auto companies have seen their share prices lag in recent years because investors believe that the boom cycle — driven by historically low interest rates that bolstered auto sales — may be exhausted and that fast-changing technology presents an uncertain future. Ford may be down more than its counterparts, but some analysts think the change has more to do with the company’s founding family. “Ford has one, big shareholder,” said Matthew Stover, an analyst with Susquehanna Financial Group, referring to the extended Ford clan. “The board and the Ford family thought, ‘We have ideas and we aren’t acting fast enough and we’re not getting enough credit.’ I don’t think it’s more complicated than that.” Despite its 14.6 percent share of the U.S. car and truck market in 2016, Ford’s market value of $44 billion has been surpassed by electric-car upstart Tesla at $50 billion. The U.S. auto market is expected to slow this year. Hackett’s job will be to reinvent Ford into a new transportation company capable of prospering in a highly competitive and fast-changing business. [Tesla’s ‘crazy’ climb to America’s most valuable car company] Ford is facing competition not only from traditional competitors such as General Motors and Toyota. The icon is also battling a new cadre of would-be transportation players who have Detroit on edge. In addition to Tesla, ride-sharing companies such as Uber Technologies and tech juggernauts such as Alphabet are venturing into the transportation domain with smart-car ambitions and revolutionary ideas around fuel. Karl Brauer, executive publisher for Autotrader and Kelley Blue Book, credited Fields with turning in profits and investing in technology. “But over this same period Mary Barra and GM have produced even more impressive financial results by focusing on where GM can be profitable while removing business units showing little promise,” Brauer said, referring to the GM chief executive. “Add in the rise of Tesla . . . and the impressive results Fields delivered simply weren’t enough to satisfy Ford’s stockholders.” Palo Alto, Calif.-based Tesla, founded by billionaire Elon Musk, lost hundreds of millions of dollars last year, has yet to turn a profit and last year produced just 84,000 cars. But its rise has put a scare into the legacy automakers such as Ford and General Motors. [By selling its European brands, GM ‘gets rid of a perennial loser’] Ford is betting that Hackett is up to the job. The former center for the University of Michigan football team is a personal friend of Bill Ford’s, whose family controls the auto giant through its ownership of voting shares. Unlike most auto executives, Hackett does not have a long history in the industry. When Hackett joined Ford Smart Mobility, he had been on the Ford Motor board of directors for three years. “Hackett, together with Bill Ford, will focus on three priorities: Sharpening operational execution, modernizing Ford’s present business and transforming the company to meet tomorrow’s challenges,” according to a company news release. Ford is known for making some unusual CEO choices. Bill Ford in 2006 hired Mulally from Boeing. Mulally privately borrowed nearly $30 billion to rebuild Ford without government assistance. His overhaul of the automaker included forging new agreements with auto unions that saved costs. Mulally retired after putting the company on a solid footing. Hackett is known as a customer-minded turnaround artist who thinks outside the box. Like Mulally, Hackett’s style is reported to be more relaxed and direct than the hard-charging Fields, who came up through the Ford ranks. The company seems conscious enough about those comparisons that in a Monday news conference, Bill Ford said, “I promised myself I wouldn’t compare [Hackett] to Alan this morning because it’s not right — they’re very different leaders for very different times.” But, he said, “I’ll break this rule just this once,” saying both Mulally and Hackett were the types of leaders able to “capture the hearts and minds of employees” and make them feel that “not only could we win but we were going to win and they were going to have fun on the journey.” [Seven automotive trends to watch in 2017] Ford could also be hoping that an outsider will strike gold again, bringing a fresh set of eyes to a car company that could use a jump-start. “It certainly breaks with a long, inbred tradition,” said Noel Tichy, a professor at the University of Michigan’s Ross School of Business who has studied CEO succession. Traditionally, “these guys live in a little cocoon in the greater Detroit area,” making Mulally and Hackett more unusual picks, he said. As the chief executive of Steelcase, where he served for almost two decades, Hackett transformed the business culture of the office furniture company and advocated a more open-office physical space. He stepped down in 2014. His nontraditional background includes 16 months as the interim athletic director at the University of Michigan, where he is best known for hiring Jim Harbaugh as its head football coach. Tichy, who said he has worked with Hackett helping with leadership development and consulting for more than two decades, called him a “transformational leader” who is good at team-building and is known for having a reputation for integrity, Tichy said. The former Steelcase CEO voluntarily recalled wall panels of cubicles at the Pentagon that weren’t up to higher fire standards. Later reviews said the updated walls kept the fires from spreading on the morning of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, Tichy said of a story that has also been recounted in management guides. Chris DeRose, a consultant in Ann Arbor, Mich., who has worked with Tichy and with Steelcase, said of Hackett taking the helm: “The analogous thing is he would talk about taking Steelcase out of commodity hell. When you think about where the auto industry is, I think there’s a pretty clear message that here’s a guy who knows how to differentiate in a low-margin, commodity-based business.” business economy true Please provide a valid email address.

Tanya Agrawal Reuters Published Monday, May 22, 2017 11:16AM EDT Last updated Monday, May 22, 2017 11:19AM EDT Comments Share via email Share on facebook Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Print Wall Street was higher in late morning trading on Monday, boosted by technology shares and as defence stocks rose after a multi-billion dollar arms deal between the United States and Saudi Arabia. President Donald Trump visited Saudi Arabia over the weekend and sealed $110-billion in deals in which Riyadh will buy U.S. arms to help it counter Iran, with options running as high as $350-billion over 10 years. Shares of defence firms such as General Dynamics, Raytheon, Boeing and Lockheed Martin were up between 1 per cent and 2.2 per cent. “The bar for success has been set extremely low for President Trump and it seems that he’s been able to meet that over the weekend,” said Kim Forrest, senior equity research analyst, Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh. Trump’s visit is his first foreign trip since taking office and one the White House hopes will shift the focus away from domestic controversies such as his firing of a former FBI head last week and reports of his administration’s links to Russia. “The commentary on what happened in Saudi Arabia, most of it, was good. Because we were down last week because of political news the inverse is true too: that nothing bad happened over the weekend in political news.” At 10:47 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 79.39 points, or 0.38 per cent, at 20,884.23, the S&P 500 was up 7.16 points, or 0.30 per cent, at 2,388.89 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 31.16 points, or 0.51 per cent, at 6,114.86. Markets in Canada were closed Monday for the Victoria Day holiday. Gains were broad based, with nine of the 11 S&P sectors trading higher, led by the tech sector’s 0.55 and industrials index’s 0.50 per cent rise. Boeing was the biggest boost on the Dow. Amazon’s near 1 per cent rise was the biggest positive influence on the S&P and the Nasdaq. Forrest said that while strong earnings and mostly positive economic data will help provide support, the market will continue to be susceptible in the near term to political developments and what it means for Trump’s agenda for tax cuts and higher infrastructure spending. Also bolstering the market was a 1 per cent gain in oil prices due to confidence that top exporters will this week agree to extend supply curbs, or even be deepen cuts. Ford was up 1.7 per cent at $11.05 after the automaker named James Hackett, who heads its unit developing self-driving cars, as chief executive, responding to investors’ growing unease about its stock price and prospects. Berkshire Hathaway was up about 0.8 per cent after Barron’s said on Saturday the conglomerate’s stock could see double digit gains over the next year and a half even if Chairman Warren Buffett decided to retire. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,798 to 938. On the Nasdaq, 1,621 issues rose and 999 fell. The S&P 500 index showed 31 new 52-week highs and one new low, while the Nasdaq recorded 74 new highs and 24 new lows.

Business News Home > Business > Business News < Back to SMG 45 Monday, 22 May 2017 | MYT 11:44 PM Wall St gains as defense, tech stocks rise At 10:47am ET (Monday) the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 79.39 points, or 0.38%, at 20,884.23. The Reuters photo shows a man walking past the New York Stock Exchange. NEW YORK: Wall Street was higher in late morning trading on Monday, boosted by technology shares and as defense stocks rose after a multi-billion dollar arms deal between the United States and Saudi Arabia. President Donald Trump visited Saudi Arabia over the weekend and sealed US$110bil in deals in which Riyadh will buy US arms to help it counter Iran, with options running as high as US$350bil over 10 years. Shares of defense firms such as General Dynamics, Raytheon, Boeing and Lockheed Martin were up between 1% and 2.2%. “The bar for success has been set extremely low for President Trump and it seems that he’s been able to meet that over the weekend,” said Kim Forrest, senior equity research analyst, Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh. Trump’s visit is his first foreign trip since taking office and one the White House hopes will shift the focus away from domestic controversies such as his firing of a former FBI head last week and reports of his administration’s links to Russia. “The commentary on what happened in Saudi Arabia, most of it, was good. Because we were down last week because of political news the inverse is true too: that nothing bad happened over the weekend in political news.” At 10:47am ET (1447 GMT) the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 79.39 points, or 0.38%, at 20,884.23, the S&P 500 was up 7.16 points, or 0.30%, at 2,388.89 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 31.16 points, or 0.51%, at 6,114.86. Gains were broad based, with nine of the 11 S&P sectors trading higher, led by the tech sector’s 0.55% and industrials index’s 0.50% rise. Boeing was the biggest boost on the Dow. Amazon’s near 1% rise was the biggest positive influence on the S&P and the Nasdaq. Forrest said that while strong earnings and mostly positive economic data will help provide support, the market will continue to be susceptible in the near term to political developments and what it means for Trump’s agenda for tax cuts and higher infrastructure spending. Also bolstering the market was a 1% gain in oil prices due to confidence that top exporters will this week agree to extend supply curbs, or even be deepen cuts. Ford was up 1.7% at US$11.05 after the automaker named James Hackett, who heads its unit developing self-driving cars, as chief executive, responding to investors’ growing unease about its stock price and prospects. Berkshire Hathaway was up about 0.8% after Barron’s said on Saturday the conglomerate’s stock could see double digit gains over the next year and a half even if Chairman Warren Buffett decided to retire. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,798 to 938. On the Nasdaq, 1,621 issues rose and 999 fell. The S&P 500 index showed 31 new 52-week highs and one new low, while the Nasdaq recorded 74 new highs and 24 new lows. - Reuters   Tags / Keywords: Foreign News , Stocks , Wall Street Related Stories Related Stories Wall Street ends up; defense, tech stocks a boost(Update 1) Wall St gains as Trump rout eases Wall St edges up as investors buy beaten down stocks Wall Street skids amid Trump turmoil Wall St retreats after S&P, Nasdaq hit record highs You May Be Interested Maybank IB: A temporary blip in TIV Asian stocks steady early Tuesday, sterling retreats after Manchester blast The evolution of mobile phones Coway promotes a healthy lifestyle When the CEO is your mentor 10 after work habits for personal success Others Also Read Section 14, PJ folk want answers on planned highway project Serving up a bountiful spread Bahrain security forces push into Shi'ite leader's home village Property Related advertisement Latest News Ranhill to raise power generation capacity to 1,000 MW Kerjaya Prospek secures RM77mil contract Wing Tai gets take over offer for RM1.80 per share Noble shares tumble after S&P ratings downgrade KLCI in the red midday, Ringgit at 4.2965 Most Viewed in Business MBI, Mface placed on Bank Negara's financial alerts MK Land gets surprise tax bill from IRB Oil prices fall early Tuesday as White House proposes US oil reserve sales Bursa issues UMA query to Visdynamics Magnum shares down on a mixture of bad news Ringgit higher against US$ Tuesday 7-Eleven first Malaysian retailer to accept Alipay IHH facing wrath of volatile Turkish lira AmBank bags three awards at the MEEA Petropolymer to build RM1.3bil NBR factory in Johor advertisement advertisement site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Lifestyle Tech Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services Magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs Advertising View Our Rate Card Policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu StarProperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com Search The Star Online Connect with us Content Partner Our Radio Stations site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Tech Lifestyle Travel Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs advertising View Our Rate Card policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu starproperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com social media Facebook Twitter Copyright © 1995- Star Media Group Berhad (ROC 10894D)

Also bolstering the market was a 1 percent gain in oil prices due to confidence that top exporters will this week agree to extend supply curbs, or even be deepen cuts. Ford was up 1.7 percent at $11.05 after the automaker named James Hackett, who heads its unit developing self-driving cars, as chief executive, responding to investors' growing unease about its stock price and prospects. Berkshire Hathaway was up about 0.8 percent after Barron's said on Saturday the conglomerate's stock could see double digit gains over the next year and a half even if Chairman Warren Buffett decided to retire. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,798 to 938. On the Nasdaq, 1,621 issues rose and 999 fell. The S&amp;P 500 index showed 31 new 52-week highs and one new low, while the Nasdaq recorded 74 new highs and 24 new lows.

Shares of BA stock more than doubled the S&P 500 last year, and they’ve surged 16% to do it again for the year-to-date. Source: Wikimedia Much of that has been driven by the belief that President Donald Trump will continue to pump significant dollars into military spending, though Boeing is getting a different Trump bump today amid his visit to Saudi Arabia, which has just inked some new contracts with the defense and aerospace giant, along with Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT). Despite Trump’s tweets about the cost of Air Force one, his pro-military budget has already made plans to increase America’s defense forces budget by a substantial sum. Boeing will get a decent slice of that pie. So it’s no wonder why investors have bid up shares of BA stock — along with rivals like LMT and Raytheon Company (NYSE:RTN) — by substantial sums. The question is how much of those gains can keep coming, and how can Boeing stock stay aloft if that particular narrative peters out? Boeing: Too Far, Too Fast? With Boeing shares up such a staggering amount in such a small time, investors have to wonder how much more growth is in the tank to back up the action. The short answer might be “no,” but that would come with a big asterisk. It’s not that BA is a bad company — it still features a host of positives. The problem is that Boeing’s attributes don’t necessarily justify the swing we’ve seen. The story for Boeing has been driven by Trump and his military plans, but investors might have gotten ahead of themselves. BA isn’t a 100% pure defense firm. In fact, not even a third of its revenues come from military warplanes and equipment. Last year, only about 23% of Boeing’s revenues came from U.S. government contracts, which includes foreign military sales that are done via the U.S. government. So it’s not even 100% based on the Pentagon and various U.S. military branches. The vast bulk of Boeing’s sales are still commercial in nature; those sales are increasingly coming from foreign companies and state-owned airlines. Thus, Trump is certainly good for Boeing, but we’re not talking about a massive binge. The 737 Max and Dreamliner are still driving the show. That’s something to consider when looking at BA stock today. Shares of Boeing now trade for 24 times earnings, which is above both the market and the company’s own historical norms. Price-to-sales is even more worrisome; from 2000 to 2016, BA stock on average traded for about 0.85 sales … but today that number is north of 1.1. Investors clearly are giving Boeing a premium — a problem considering how rare that is. It’s All About Cash Flow While BA is clearly expensive and might not live up to its future hype as a hot play on military spend, it’s not necessarily going to crash and burn. Instead, investors should expect more muted gains unless World War 3 breaks out with North Korea.

Tanya Agrawal Reuters Published Monday, May 22, 2017 9:41AM EDT Last updated Monday, May 22, 2017 9:48AM EDT Comments Share via email Share on facebook Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Print Wall Street gained in early trading on Monday, helped by higher oil prices and as defence stocks rose after a $110-billion arms deal between the United States and Saudi Arabia. Oil prices were up about 0.6 per cent, bolstered by confidence that top exporters will this week agree to extend supply curbs, with suggestions that the cuts could even be deepened. President Donald Trump visited Saudi Arabia over the weekend, on his first foreign trip since taking office and one that the White House hopes will shift the focus away from domestic controversies such as his firing of a former FBI head last week and reports of his administration’s links to Russia. The central achievement of Trump’s visit was nearly $110-billion in deals sealed on Saturday in which Riyadh will buy U.S. arms to help it counter Iran, with options running as high as $350-billion over 10 years. Shares of defense firms such as General Dynamics, Raytheon, Boeing and Lockheed Martin were up between 0.6 per cent and 2.2 per cent in early trading. All the 11 S&P sectors were higher, led by the industrials index’s 0.68 per cent rise. Boeing was giving the biggest boost to the Dow Jones Industrial Average. “While the headlines of the Trump visit are overshadowing the geopolitical and domestic political concerns, oil prices are moving higher ... on OPEC expectations,” Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at First Standard Financial wrote in a note. At 9:35 a.m. (ET), the Dow was up 76.07 points, or 0.37 per cent, at 20,880.91, the S&P 500 was up 7.98 points, or 0.33 per cent, at 2,389.71 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 25.32 points, or 0.42 per cent, at 6,109.02. Markets in Canada were closed Monday for the Victoria Day long weekend. Wall Street ended lower last week on concerns about the political storm surrounding Trump’s presidency, with investors fretting if Trump will be able to fulfill campaign promises for fiscal stimulus and tax reform. Many investors saw the policy promises as a key reason for the rally in U.S. stocks since his election win in November. While the political developments in Washington continue to play on investors’ minds, sentiment has been bolstered by the strong quarterly earnings season. Corporate reports show that, overall, earnings for S&P 500 companies increased 15.1 per cent in the first quarter, their best showing since 2011, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Amgen fell 2.3 per cent to $152.85 after the company and UCB SA said they no longer expect their experimental osteoporosis drug to win U.S. approval this year. Ford was up 1.7 per cent at $11.05 after the automaker said it would replace its chief executive in response to investors’ growing unease over its stock performance and prospects. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,905 to 620. On the Nasdaq, 1,528 issues rose and 658 fell. The S&P 500 index showed 13 new 52-week highs and one new low, while the Nasdaq recorded 37 new highs and seven new lows.

Michael Nagle Updated at 3:34 p.m. NEW YORK • Strong gains for technology companies like software and chip makers helped lead U.S. stocks higher Monday. Defense contractors also climbed as the market continued to bounce back from a bout of turbulence last week. Stocks rose for the third day in a row. Technology companies are closing in on all-time highs and continued to rise Monday, led by big names like Cisco Systems and Qualcomm. Aerospace and defense companies rose after President Donald Trump presided over a huge sale of military equipment to Saudi Arabia. Amazon led consumer-focused companies higher. Energy companies lagged even though oil prices continued their recent climb. Sameer Samana, a strategist for Wells Fargo Investment Institute, said people continue to spend more money on personal electronics while businesses invest in automation and software to boost their productivity. "In a low-growth environment, you've got to squeeze more out of every dollar of investment," Samana said. At the same time, he added, some overseas markets have been stronger than expected this year. The Standard & Poor's 500 index jumped 12.29 points, or 0.5 percent, to 2,394.02. The Dow Jones industrial average added 89.99 points, or 0.4 percent, to 20,894.83. The Nasdaq composite gained 49.91 points, or 0.8 percent, to 6,133.62. The Russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks picked up 9.81 points, or 0.7 percent, to 1,377.14. The technology component of the S&P 500 index has soared 18 percent this year, almost three times as much as the broader S&P 500. On Monday chipmaker Qualcomm gained $1.61, or 2.8 percent, to $59.28 and Cisco Systems, which sells equipment like routers, switches and software, rose 38 cents, or 1.2 percent, to $31.59. Adobe Systems picked up $2.42, or 1.8 percent, to $138.85 and design software maker Autodesk jumped $3.45, or 3.1 percent, to $113.36. Both the S&P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq composite set records early last week before worries about growing political uncertainty in Washington, which could hamper President Trump's agenda of tax cuts and deregulation, knocked those indexes back from their highs. The Russell 2000 of smaller companies, which would benefit more than large ones from Trump's proposals, is down 3 percent from the record it set a month ago. Samana said he thinks stocks will become more volatile in the coming months, but not because of politics. Instead, he thinks stocks will break out of their unusual calm because the Federal Reserve and European Central Bank will pull back on the stabilizing measures they've used since the global financial crisis. "If they both start to lay the groundwork for pulling back on the extraordinary stimulus, that's probably the catalyst for a little bit more volatility," he said. Aerospace and defense companies climbed after President Trump presided over a $110 billion sale of military equipment to Saudi Arabia. The agreement could expand to $350 billion over 10 years. Lockheed Martin climbed $4.24, or 1.6 percent, to $277.03 and Boeing gained $2.91, or 1.6 percent, to $183.67. Amgen and its partner UCB said women who took their experimental osteoporosis drug Evenity were more likely to have serious cardiovascular problems than patients who took Fosamax, an older drug. The companies said that was a new safety concern and they no longer expect the Food and Drug Administration to approve Evenity this year. Amgen lost $3.49, or 2.2 percent, to $153.02. Ford replaced CEO Mark Fields as it struggles to keep the traditional parts of its business running smoothly while it tries to remake itself as a nimble, high-tech automaker. In Fields' three years as CEO, popular cars like the Fusion sedan became dated and Ford lagged competitors in bringing long-range electric cars to market. Ford's new CEO is Jim Hackett, who has led Ford's mobility unit for more than a year.

U.S-based Huntsman and Swiss specialty chemicals maker Clariant are merging to create a company with a market value of $13.8 billion. The company will call itself HuntsmanClariant and Clariant shareholders will own 52 percent of the new company. Huntsman stock slid 56 cents, or 2.1 percent, to $26.15 and Clariant stock rose 3.4 percent in Switzerland. Oil prices continued to rally. Benchmark U.S. crude oil added 40 cents to $50.73 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, rose 26 cents to $53.87 a barrel in London. Wholesale gasoline gained 1 cent to $1.66 a gallon. Heating oil rose 2 cents to $1.60 a gallon. Natural gas climbed 7 cents, or 2.3 percent, to $3.33 per 1,000 cubic feet. Gold rose $7.80 to $1,261.40 an ounce. Silver jumped 40 cents, or 2.4 percent, to $17.19 an ounce. Copper rose 1 cent to $2.60 a pound. Bond prices moved a bit lower.

At 9:35 a.m. ET (1335 GMT) the Dow was up 76.07 points, or 0.37 percent, at 20,880.91, the S&P 500 was up 7.98 points, or 0.33 percent, at 2,389.71 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 25.32 points, or 0.42 percent, at 6,109.02. Wall Street ended lower last week on concerns about the political storm surrounding Trump's presidency, with investors fretting if Trump will be able to fulfill campaign promises for fiscal stimulus and tax reform. Many investors saw the policy promises as a key reason for the rally in U.S. stocks since his election win in November. While the political developments in Washington continue to play on investors' minds, sentiment has been bolstered by the strong quarterly earnings season. Corporate reports show that, overall, earnings for S&P 500 companies increased 15.1 percent in the first quarter, their best showing since 2011, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Amgen fell 2.3 percent to $152.85 after the company and UCB SA said they no longer expect their experimental osteoporosis drug to win U.S. approval this year. Ford was up 1.7 percent at $11.05 after the automaker said it would replace its chief executive in response to investors' growing unease over its stock performance and prospects. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,905 to 620. On the Nasdaq, 1,528 issues rose and 658 fell. The S&P 500 index showed 13 new 52-week highs and one new low, while the Nasdaq recorded 37 new highs and seven new lows.

China-Russia joint venture unveil their nameplate - chinadaily.com.cn The Shanghai-based China-Russia Commercial Aircraft International Co Ltd (CRAIC) has completed its business registration and obtained a license to operate, said its Chinese parent, state-owned Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC). COMAC Chairman Jin Zhuanglong said the joint venture marks key progress in a Sino-Russian programme to develop wide-body aircraft and aims to produce "competitive" long-haul planes for the world's aviation market. CRAIC will be responsible for research, manufacturing, marketing, sales and services of its aircraft. According to an agreement by COMAC and its Russian partner United Aircraft Corp (UAC), 280-seat jets with a range of 12,000 kilometers will be prioritised. Earlier this month, COMAC's narrow-body passenger aircraft C919 completed its maiden flight. The C919 is China's first domestically-produced large aircraft, designed to rival Airbus' updated A320 and Boeing's new generation B737. The aircraft design process will soon begin, according to the plan. The general assembly line will be based in Shanghai. An eight-member strong board of directors, half from China and half from Russia, will be headed by UAC vice president Vladislav Masalov. COMAC already has two aircrafts from its regional model ARJ21 on the mark, state-run Xinhua news agency reported. #Airbus#Boeing#China#Newstracker#Passenger jets#Russia#Shanghai#Sino-russian programme#World Published Date: May 22, 2017 06:46 pm | Updated Date: May 22, 2017 06:46 pm Also See China's Lin Dan feels 'bitterly disappointed' after club fails to pay salary Vladimir Putin shows off his music skills in China, plays soviet classics on Xi Jinping's piano Archery World Cup: Here's how Twitter reacted to India's win over Colombia to clinch gold medal T20 LEAGUE SCHEDULE Match Date Details Full Schedule Top Stories Kashmir unrest: Infighting, ideological rifts betray Hizbul Mujahideen's deepening fault lines RJD Leader Prabhunath Singh Awarded Life Sentence in 22-yr-old Murder Case Manchester Arena terror attack: Suspected Islamic State sympathiser tweeted about attack hours earlier IPL 2017: From Ben Stokes to Ishant Sharma, here's a look at the hits and flops from the 10th edition Seven common mistakes that investors should avoid Paytm Payments Bank starts operations: Check out what's on offer for the customers here Cannes 2017 Day 6: Priyanka Chopra's Sikkimese film unveiled, Shruti Haasan meets Neil Gaiman Cricket Scores Current & Recent Upcoming Indian Premier League, 2017 PNE Vs MUM Mumbai Indians beat Rising Pune Supergiant by 1 run Ireland Tri-Nation Series, 2017 IRE Vs NZ New Zealand beat Ireland by 190 runs Ireland Tri-Nation Series, 2017 IRE Vs BAN Bangladesh beat Ireland by 8 wickets Indian Premier League, 2017 MUM Vs KOL Mumbai Indians beat Kolkata Knight Riders by 6 wickets Ireland Tri-Nation Series, 2017 BAN Vs NZ New Zealand beat Bangladesh by 4 wickets Indian Premier League, 2017 HYD Vs KOL Kolkata Knight Riders beat Sunrisers Hyderabad by 7 wickets (D/L method) Indian Premier League, 2017 MUM Vs PNE Rising Pune Supergiant beat Mumbai Indians by 20 runs Indian Premier League, 2017 DEL Vs BLR Royal Challengers Bangalore beat Delhi Daredevils by 10 runs Indian Premier League, 2017 PNE Vs PUN Rising Pune Supergiant beat Kings XI Punjab by 9 wickets Ireland Tri-Nation Series, 2017 IRE Vs NZ New Zealand beat Ireland by 51 runs Ireland Tri-Nation Series, 2017 BAN vs NZ - May 24th, 2017, 03:15 PM IST South Africa in England, 3 ODI Series, 2017 ENG vs SA - May 24th, 2017, 06:30 PM IST ICC Champions Trophy Warm-up Matches, 2017 AUS vs SL - May 26th, 2017, 03:00 PM IST ICC Champions Trophy Warm-up Matches, 2017 BAN vs PAK - May 27th, 2017, 03:00 PM IST South Africa in England, 3 ODI Series, 2017 ENG vs SA - May 27th, 2017, 03:30 PM IST ICC Champions Trophy Warm-up Matches, 2017 IND vs NZ - May 28th, 2017, 03:00 PM IST ICC Champions Trophy Warm-up Matches, 2017 AUS vs PAK - May 29th, 2017, 03:00 PM IST South Africa in England, 3 ODI Series, 2017 ENG vs SA - May 29th, 2017, 03:30 PM IST ICC Champions Trophy Warm-up Matches, 2017 NZ vs SL - May 30th, 2017, 03:00 PM IST ICC Champions Trophy Warm-up Matches, 2017 IND vs BAN - May 30th, 2017, 03:00 PM IST Site Index हिंदी फर्स्टपोस्ट About Firstpost Newsletter RSS Twitter Facebook Sections Front Page Politics Sports India World Business Life Entertainment Photos Videos Plus New Delhi Mumbai Photos Videos FP Exclusives Video Room Weather Others Sample Papers Online Business Technology News MTV India Online Shopping in India ICC Champions Trophy 2017 IPL 2017 E-Learning Franchise Opportunity Tools RSS Feeds Apps iOS Android Copyright © 2017.

Hainan Airlines to buy 19 Boeing jetsMon, 22 May 2017 2:34 PM Share Your Email Hainan Airlines and its parent HNA Group have been among the most acquisitive players in a wave of overseas investments by Chinese companies in recent years. Credit: AFP.     China's Hainan Airlines, which has poured billions of dollars into overseas acquisitions, announced plans Monday to buy 19 Boeing aircraft for $4.2 billion to help meet skyrocketing travel demand by Chinese consumers. The company said in a statement to Shanghai's stock exchange that it would buy 13 Boeing 787-9 passenger jets and six 737-8s, citing the continued "rapid growth" in China's travel market as incomes rise. It plans to issue 15 billion yuan ($2.18 billion) in bonds to help fund the deal. Chinese airlines have seen booming business in recent years, rushing to expand their fleets and route networks amid growth that the International Air Transport Association (IATA) predicts will take China past the United States to become the world's largest air-travel market by 2024. Hainan Airlines and its parent HNA Group have been among the most acquisitive players in a wave of overseas investments by Chinese companies in recent years. HNA is a sprawling conglomerate with interests in aviation and tourism. Last year alone, HNA purchased Brazil's third largest airline Azul, Swiss airline catering company gategroup, and stakes airline Virgin Australia and Portuguese national airline TAP. A unit of privately held HNA announced in October plans to buy the aircraft leasing business of US-based CIT Group Inc. for $10 billion. The Chinese government has encouraged companies to invest overseas to open up new markets. Many companies obliged, pouring billions into overseas purchases to such an extent that Chinese authorities became worried over capital flight and the impact on the slumping yuan currency. The government has since reversed course, denouncing "irrational" investment abroad and putting restrictions on fund outflows.

Gen. Carl A. Buhler. “Boeing supervisors also pushed mechanics to complete tasks for the purpose of showing progress,” which compromised quality. Air Force One arrived in San Antonio in April 2015 for heavy maintenance, and the crew was 24,000 hours behind schedule within a few months, the investigation found. To make up for lost time, mechanics worked 12-hour shifts up to 7 days a week for months leading up to the accident, according to the March 6 report obtained by the San Antonio Express-News. According to the Air Force, one of the president's Air Force One planes was put at risk when mechanics used contaminated tools during "heavy maintenance" last April. The lapse caused roughly $4 million in damages. The contamination occurred in April of last year while President Barack Obama was still president. There was a risk of fire breaking out on the plane because of unsafe cleaning procedures. Media: WochIt Media “In addition to the direct actions that caused the mishap, I find by a preponderance of evidence that Boeing ignoring cautions and warnings, inadequate oversight and a failure to absorb or retain the critical oxygen cleanliness training procedures substantially contributed” to the damages, the Air Force found after a five-month investigation. The Air Force disclosed May 9 that three Boeing mechanics at the company’s Port San Antonio facility had contaminated the Boeing 747-200B’s oxygen system in April 2016, creating a fire hazard and forcing the plane to Seattle for testing. The trouble began when the company decided in 2012 to transfer the contract servicing the executive fleet from Wichita, Kansas, to San Antonio, where the personnel were less experienced. While Boeing had three years to bring its Texas staff up to speed, 172 of its employees lacked the minimum requirement of five years of experience by the time they took over the work in 2015, the report said. The Air Force granted Boeing a waiver on its experience requirement March 31, 2015, but it came with a caveat. “Boeing was required to provide adequate oversight to control the risk of its inexperienced workforce in San Antonio,” the report said. “Although Boeing attempted a few mitigation measures, Boeing ultimately failed to exercise adequate oversight over the (plane’s) depot maintenance operations, contributing to the mishap.” Boeing said it immediately disclosed the problem and covered all the costs to repair the VC-25A plane, one of two modified 747s used by the White House as Air Force One. “We didn’t hide anything. We elevated it ourselves, we caught it ourselves, we fixed it ourselves,” Boeing spokesman Ben Davis said. “The report is accurate and factual,” he said. “We supported the investigation and … took swift action to self-report the incident to the Air Force.” Air Force spokeswoman Ann Stefanek said the military still plans to service the executive fleet in San Antonio. “The Air Force is confident Boeing has improved its oversight practices and can provide safe and effective heavy maintenance for the VC-25A,” Stefanek said. The report targeted the mechanics involved in the incident for using contaminated tools on the 747-200B’s oxygen system. One mechanic had completed training on proper methods for maintaining oxygen systems just weeks before the incident. Such contamination could have led to a fire in the airplane, according to the report. Supervision demanded by the Air Force was not provided until much of the damage had been done. Davis said the mechanics “did not follow the standards” laid out in their training. Neither Davis nor Buhler’s report said whether or not the employees were fired or otherwise disciplined. “We’ve been serving the presidential fleet for over 50 years,” Davis said. “It’s a responsibility we take seriously.” rdruzin@express-news.net @druz_journo This article was updated to reflect that Air Force One’s oxygen system was tested in Seattle, not repaired.

Lockheed won contracts worth around $28 billion during the state visit, which will see Saudi Arabia buying air and missile defence equipment from it, along with navy ships, aircraft and helicopters. "We are especially proud of how our broad portfolio of advanced global security products and technologies will enhance national security in Saudi Arabia, strengthen the cause of peace in the region, and provide the foundation for job creation and economic prosperity in the U.S. and in the Kingdom," said Lockheed CEO Marilyn Hewson. Lockheed was trading nearly 3% higher during early premarket trading, changing hands at $280.35, which is enough to take the stock's year to date return above 10% when the market opens Boeing was also another big winner after it said that the Saudis have agreed to buy a series of new aircraft, weapons systems and helicopters.  The deals came as President Donald Trump made his first trip overseas, heading directly to Saudi Arabia where he spoke with leaders from across the Arab world about the threat of terrorism, while also going on to tout for business. Boeing stock was up just more than 0.5% during early premarket trading, changing hands at $181.70, after already having gained nearly 2% on Friday.

The United States approved a series of deals worth more than $7 billion to supply military helicopters, planes and missiles to four of its Arab allies involved in the coalition waging war on rebels in Yemen. The latest approval marks another windfall for plane maker Boeing and other large US defence manufacturers, although it may face opposition from critics of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates’ controversial role in Yemen’s ongoing civil war. Among the biggest agreement announced by the US State Department was for the $3.51 billion sale to the Saudi kingdom – which is leading the coalition in Yemen – of 48 CH-47F Chinook cargo helicopters with spare engines and machine guns. Boeing and Honeywell Aerospace will be the main contractors, while up to 60 Americans – both private and government employees – will work in Saudi Arabia to maintain the aircraft. Meanwhile, the United Arab Emirates spent $3.5 billion on 27 AH-64E Apache attack helicopters plus support equipment, made by Boeing and Lockheed Martin. Qatar has requested eight C-17 military cargo jets and spare engines in a pair of contracts totalling $781 million. Washington also approved a contract to sell Morocco 1,200 TOW 2A anti-tank missiles made by US arms giant Raytheon for $108 million. Although the State Department has approved the sales, after consultation with the Pentagon, Congress could still block them in theory due to widespread criticism of the Saudi-led coalition war on Yemen which has killed more than 10,000 since it began. All four Arab countries involved are US allies and have made major arms purchases in the past, meaning the contracts are expected to be approved without problem.

Boeing said Saudi Arabia agreed to buy Chinook helicopters, associated support services and guided weapons systems, and intends to purchase P-8 surveillance aircraft. The company also said it would negotiate the sale of up to 16 wide body airplanes to Saudi Gulf Airlines, based in Dammam. Boeing Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg, who participated in the Saudi-US CEO Forum, stated that these announcements reaffirm the company’s commitment to the economic growth, prosperity and national security of both Saudi Arabia and the United States, helping to create or sustain thousands of jobs in both countries. Boeing also will establish a joint venture with Saudi Arabia to provide sustainment services for a wide range of military platforms including non-Boeing supplied equipment. A separate joint venture would “provide support for both military and commercial helicopters,” the company’s statement added. “Our decades-long partnership with the Kingdom began in 1945 when President Roosevelt presented a DC-3 to King Abdul Aziz Al Saud, launching commercial air travel in the region. We welcome the opportunity to continue that support. I appreciate the efforts of King Salman, President Trump and his administration to support American manufacturers as we seek to grow at home and around the world,” explained Muilenburg.

The company said in a statement to Shanghai's stock exchange that it would buy 13 Boeing 787-9 passenger jets and six 737-8s, citing the continued "rapid growth" in China's travel market as incomes rise. It plans to issue 15 billion yuan ($2.18 billion) in bonds to help fund the deal. Chinese airlines have seen booming business in recent years, rushing to expand their fleets and route networks amid growth that the International Air Transport Association (IATA) predicts will take China past the United States to become the world's largest air-travel market by 2024. Hainan Airlines and its parent HNA Group have been among the most acquisitive players in a wave of overseas investments by Chinese companies in recent years. HNA is a sprawling conglomerate with interests in aviation and tourism. Last year alone, HNA purchased Brazil's third largest airline Azul, Swiss airline catering company gategroup, and stakes airline Virgin Australia and Portuguese national airline TAP. A unit of privately held HNA announced in October plans to buy the aircraft leasing business of US-based CIT Group Inc. for $10 billion. The Chinese government has encouraged companies to invest overseas to open up new markets. Many companies obliged, pouring billions into overseas purchases to such an extent that Chinese authorities became worried over capital flight and the impact on the slumping yuan currency. The government has since reversed course, denouncing "irrational" investment abroad and putting restrictions on fund outflows.

With the S&P 500 down 1.5% over the past week, it seems turmoil in the Trump Administration isn't doing investors a lot of favors. But give Donald Trump credit where credit is due. His administration is doing great things for one segment of the stock market: The defense industry. Introducing Uncle Sam: Arms dealer to the world We know this because late last month, the Trump Administration Defense Security Cooperation Agency notified Congress of a whole slew of big ticket arms deals in the works -- weapons sales that promise to pour literally billions of dollars of new revenues into the coffers of some of America's biggest defense contractors. On one particularly big news day, April 28, the DSCA announced that it has notified Congress of no fewer than seven separate pending arms sales that it plans to push through. These deals are aiming to sell: 110 radar-seeking air-to-ground "HARM" missiles to Australia, generating sales of $137.6 million for prime contractors  Orbital ATK (NYSE:OA) and  Raytheon (NYSE:RTN) . Four P-8A Poseidon submarine-hunting jet aircraft to New Zealand -- a $1.46 billion payday for Boeing (NYSE:BA) . 13 76 mm cannon for installation aboard Israeli Navy SA'AR 4.5 and SA'AR 6 Missile Patrol Boats at a purchase price of $440 million. (Italian firm Leonardo S.p.a.'s DRS North America subsidiary will be the contractor on that one.) Nine Bell 429 light utility helicopters to Slovakia, yielding sales of $150 million for Textron (NYSE:TXT). And five CH-47D Chinook helicopters, sold out of U.S. government surplus to Greece for $80 million. Also included in the DSCA's list of pending contracts are two directed toward the NATO Support and Procurement Agency, specifically: A $300 million sale of C-17 Globemaster III logistics support services, with Boeing acting as prime contractor; and A $33.5 million sale of Large Aircraft Infrared Countermeasures (LAIRCM) components, used to protect C-17s from anti-aircraft missile attack, supplied by  Northrop Grumman (NYSE:NOC) . Add them all up, and the global shopping list for U.S. arms comes to more than $2.6 billion in total value, with most of that going to benefit prime contractors Orbital ATK and Raytheon, Boeing, Textron, and Northrop Grumman -- some of the largest defense contractors on the planet, and stalwarts of the U.S. defense industry, each and every one. And that's just the sales announced on April 28. Since those deals were announced, DSCA has also notified Congress of sales of military apparel to India, MD 530 ground attack fighters to Kenya, and air defense missiles to the United Arab Emirates -- additional billions of dollars worth of revenue for the companies involved. What it means for investors President Trump has proposed a new military budget that will feature tens of billions of dollars in increased defense spending for the Pentagon. But already, the President's administration is pushing Congress to approve billions of dollars in new weapons sales to America's allies. Between increased military spending at home and increased sales of military hardware abroad, it's boom times for the defense industry in America. So is it any wonder that the iShares U.S. Aerospace & Defense ETF (NYSEMKT:ITA)  is up 16% since the November election? Heck, if every single stock in the defense industry wasn't so clearly overvalued already, I might even buy a few of them myself. Rich Smith has no position in any stocks mentioned. The Motley Fool recommends Orbital ATK. The Motley Fool has a disclosure policy.

KUWAIT CITY, May 20: Following the Transfer-of-Title (ToT) being signed at the Boeing factory in Everett, WA, on Monday, May 15; Kuwait Airways, the official national carrier of the State of Kuwait, has today welcomed the arrival of its seventh 777-300ER aircraft, at Kuwait International Airport. The latest addition to Kuwait Airways’ fleet, flew the 15 hours direct from Seattle, WA, with non-commercial passengers on board including the airline’s new Chairman Sami Fahad Al-Rushaid. As with all of Kuwait Airways’ new Boeings, the latest aircraft carrying the airline’s new livery — as revealed in October 2016. In addition, as with many of the new 777-300ER aircraft, the seventh has been named after a Kuwaiti island. In this case, No. 7 becomes “Bubiyan” — named after the largest in Kuwait’s coastal island chain. The new addition takes Kuwait Airways’ operational fleet up to 26 and is further proof of the airline’s commitment to improving its on-board product offering, seat capacity and increasing frequencies across its 38-destination international network. While “Bubiyan” will undergo a few days of final testing before entering full-time service, it is understood that the new aircraft’s maiden commercial flight is most likely to be to Cairo or Jeddah, although this is yet to be confirmed. “Today is yet another proud moment and significant milestone on Kuwait Airways’ journey of transformation as we progress towards the goals — and implement the corresponding aircraft acquisition strategy — set out in the comprehensive, five-year plan, announced in September 2016,” said Ebrahim Al-Khuzam, CEO, Kuwait Airways. “With the Kuwaiti Government clearly aligned and in full support of ensuring the ongoing and future success of the official national carrier, we are pleased to note a continuing trend of a return in passenger confidence. This has been reflected in the increasing number of passengers coming over to Kuwait Airways — numbers well above the regional average growth rates,” Al-Khuzam added. “On the other hand, there is also a growing realisation of the importance the official national carrier of Kuwait can have on the long-term economic strategy of the country — for trade, commerce, tourism and much more,” he concluded. Kuwait Airways’ aircraft acquisition plan also includes the 25 Airbus aircraft on order; the first of which are set to be delivered from 2019. This new Airbus fleet will include 15 A320neo and 10 from the A350 family of aircraft. The airline’s new Boeing and Airbus aircraft are all expected to be in full commercial service by 2022.

Ragan Communications chief executive Mark Ragan, a former national political reporter and an early advocate of brand journalism, offers his philosophy: Stop begging the media, and become the media yourself. “Newsrooms have been decimated,” Ragan says. “If you want your company’s story told, you’d better write it or shoot it yourself. “But brand journalism works only if your story is credible, is helpful to the reader and eschews all corporate-speak and jargon. If the story is self-serving or it is designed to sell, it’s not brand journalism. It’s marketing.” (Ragan heads Ragan Consulting Group, which works with businesses to establish brand journalism sites.) From videos to white papers David Meerman Scott , another early advocate, defines brand journalism as the creation of web content—videos, blog posts, photos, charts, graphs, essays, e-books, white papers—that deliver value to the marketplace and position organizations as worthy of doing business with. “Brand journalism is not a product pitch,” he says. “It is not an advertorial. It is not an egotistical spewing of gobbledygook-laden corporate drivel.” He adds that those with the traditional skills of marketing, public relations, advertising and copywriting are not the right people to create brand journalism content. “Instead, you need the skills of a journalist,” he says.

 Trump's proposed military budget appears to be very much like the 'Obama approach' David Choi May 23, 2017, 12:43 AM 651 facebook linkedin twitter email print President Donald Trump. Joe Raedle / Staff Although President Donald Trump touted monumental changes to the Pentagon's budget and a "great rebuilding of the Armed Forces," his upcoming 2018 budget proposal released Tuesday, doesn't appear to live up to the hype. "I think that the budget that the administration will propose is roughly 3% more than what President Obama had suggested for this year," Rep. Mac Thornberry, chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, said in a Washington Examiner report. "It's roughly a 5% increase over current year funding." "So, I think it is fair to say it's basically the Obama approach with a little bit more, but not much," continued Thornberry. Trump's budget asks for 70 Lockheed Martin F-35s, 14 Boeing F/A-18E/Fs, and eight new Navy ships — just like Obama's expectation for the upcoming fiscal year, according to Bloomberg. Todd Harrison, a defense budget analyst, claimed that the budget plan would be the ninth-largest expansion in the last four decades of defense expenditures, according to a DefenseNews report. Defense analyst Mackenzie Eaglen of the American Enterprise Institute labeled it "middle of the road, vanilla stuff" and that it was "in line with recent historical precedent and is nothing extraordinary or historical," DefenseNews reported. According to some lawmakers in Congress, Trump's budget proposal may be dead on arrival. "As we’ll see with the '18 budget, the one defense dollar up and one non-defense dollar down trade will never, ever have enough votes to pass, period," continued Eaglen. Harrison also seemed to agree with the assessment. "Dead on arrival is an understatement," Harrison said. "The cuts to non-defense discretionary spending in the out years may even spook some fiscal conservatives."

BR America       中文       Deutsch       Français       日本語       ChinAfrica Search      Subscribe Home      Nation      World      Business      Opinion      Lifestyle      Multimedia      Documents      Special Reports      Africa Travel Nation Taking Wing The successful launch of the first homemade jumbo jet boosts China's entire civil aviation industry chain By Wang Hairong | NO. 20 MAY 18, 2017 The C919 takes off from the Shanghai Pudong International Airport for a 79-minute maiden flight on May 5 (XINHUA) "This is a historic moment. Finally in the sky, there is a large aircraft that belongs to China, produced according to the world's advanced standards." That was how the Commercial Aircraft Corp. of China (COMAC) announced to the world that the country's first indigenously made jumbo jet had completed its maiden flight on the afternoon of May 5, adding a milestone to China's aviation history. The C919, the pioneering plane that took off from the Shanghai Pudong International Airport and flew for 79 minutes, is a single-aisle passenger aircraft with 158 seats. Its standard flight range is 4,075 km and maximum flight range 5,555 km. COMAC had more details: "A plane with the rear fuselage painted in blue and green to symbolize the sky and earth and with youthful wings gracefully stretched out, landed steadily on the fourth runway (of the Shanghai Pudong International Airport)," it said in its a press release. Ripple effect  "I am very excited. The maiden flight is a reward for our years of hard work," Zhang Jiong, a senior engineer with COMAC's Beijing research center, told Beijing Review. Zhang, who joined COMAC in 2011 after getting his doctoral degree, said staff members had waited for nine years to see this moment. Congratulations poured in. The joint message sent by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council read, "The success of the maiden flight marks a major breakthrough in China's large aircraft project and an important milestone in the development of China's civil aviation industry." Kang Yuanli, leader of an aircraft power research team in COMAC's Beijing research center, told Beijing Review that the maiden flight was a breakthrough for several reasons. "We are not only developing and producing one plane. More importantly, through the process, we have constructed a strategic platform for civil aircraft development and research," she said, adding that the project has also promoted the upgrading of other industries, including manufacturing and electronics. In the process of developing the C919, a civil aircraft industrial chain involving nearly 200,000 persons in 200-plus companies in 22 provinces and municipalities has been formed. The project has also fostered joint ventures between 16 international aviation companies and their Chinese counterparts, spurring the production of avionics, flight control, power, fuel, landing gear and other airborne systems. COMAC, headquartered in Shanghai, was established in 2008 to coordinate the construction of jumbo jets as well as regional jets. Meeting market needs  Air transportation, once serving the rich and privileged, is now accessible to the general public. In recent years, the number of airline passengers has soared. Statistics from the Civil Aviation Administration of China show that in 2016, the annual passenger throughput of airports in China exceeded 1.16 billion, an increase of 11.1 percent over the previous year. By the end of 2016, there were 218 airports on the Chinese mainland. The data also show that most passengers travel on domestic flights. However, the passenger throughput for international routes in 2016 surpassed 100 million for the first time in China's history, up 19.3 percent over the previous year. According to Development of China's Transport, a white paper released in December 2016, China has 2,650 registered civil aviation aircraft. Boeing and Airbus are the two dominant suppliers of jumbos to China. In recent years, Chinese aviation companies have bought these airliners in large numbers. For instance, in 2015, during President Xi Jinping's visit to Seattle, the United States, Chinese aviation companies signed agreements to purchase 300 Boeings. The Aviation Industry Corp. of China has predicted that from 2015 to 2034, demand for airplanes will grow at high speed. It estimated that during this period, civil aviation companies in China will purchase 5,522 civil aircraft, including 4,580 jumbos. By the end of 2034, civil aviation fleets in China are expected to have 6,360 passenger planes in total, including 5,378 jumbo jets. So the C919 is going to enter a huge and lucrative market, where it will compete with jumbo jets such as the Boeing 737 and Airbus A320. COMAC has already received orders for 570 C919 planes from 23 customers, including China Eastern Airlines. Nonetheless, there is still a long way to go before the C919 is put into service. It will undergo years of grueling tests before it can be awarded airworthiness and other certifications. The process may take five to eight years, Kang said.   Maintenance staff on May 4 get the C919 ready for its maiden flight (XINHUA)  Cutting-edge technology  Since research to develop the C919 started in 2008, breakthroughs have been achieved in more than 100 core technologies. According to COMAC, the C919 has been designed to face 5 percent less drag, the opposing aerodynamic force that an aircraft has to face while in the air, than similar planes in service. It will also be 10 decibels quieter than the external noise standards set by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). Moreover, its designed carbon dioxide emission is 12 to 15 percent lower than ICAO standards and nitrogen oxide emission more than 50 percent lower. Last but not least, its direct operation cost is 10 percent less. To increase the plane's service life and further reduce weight, new materials such as aluminum-lithium alloy, composite and other advanced materials have been used. Composite materials comprise complementary metals, ceramic and polymer to produce better performance, said Kang. The highly integrated modular avionics system means less weight, lower energy consumption, increased safety and easier maintenance, Zhang added. COMAC has made the best use of domestic and international resources to make the C919, he explained. Some systems such as avionics and flight control were produced in joint ventures with 16 multinational companies, including U.S. General Electric and Honeywell. A jumbo jet has millions of components. Putting them together and optimizing their function is a challenging task. The C919's nose alone consists of more than 5,000 parts, which were produced by the AVIC Chengdu Aircraft Industrial Group. The aircraft's system integration was carried out by Chinese engineers.  Workers at the AVIC Chengdu Aircraft Industrial workshop assemble the C919's windshield on April 28 (XINHUA)  Crew members wave to the welcoming crowd after the C919, China's first indigenous passenger plane, completed its maiden flight and landed at the Shanghai Pudong International Airport on May 5 (XINHUA) Unsung heroes  The process of developing homemade jumbo jets has been facilitated by a team whose talent and dedication is being acknowledged now. From about 3,000 people in 2008, COMAC's staff has grown to over 10,000. Some of their stories are inspirational. Wang Wei is a metaler who joined COMAC at its inception. The 50-year-old said his interest in airplanes came from his father, who worked for Shanghai Aircraft Manufacturing Factory, presently known as the Shanghai Aviation Industrial Co. Wang's father was part of the team that made the Y-10, China's first indigenously developed jet in the 1970s. It was first flown in 1980 but the program was halted later. Wang worked in the same factory and after the Y-10 program came to a stop, he became a taxi driver. However, he was sure that one day China would need metalers again to build airplanes and he continued to practice his metaling skills in his spare time. When the news came that the C919 would be built, Wang applied at COMAC and got the job, though by that time he was over 40. In 2011, he took part in a national professional skill contest and won a prize. His story was brought to the public by China Central Television. Li Dongsheng, Deputy Director of COMAC's Beijing research center, leads the team on researching composite materials used for the wings. Before joining COMAC in 2009, Li worked in research and development for Airbus. After learning China was to build its own jumbo jet, he returned to China and joined COMAC. Kang started her career as a civil aviation electric engineer in Honeywell's subsidiary in Canada in 2002. She joined COMAC in 2013.

(Photo: Elaine Cromie, Detroit Free Press)Buy Photo CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE Ford Executive Chairman Bill Ford has once again made a bold decision to shake up the company’s leadership by hiring a new CEO from outside the auto industry. Ford is giving former Steelcase CEO Jim Hackett a mandate to inject energy into the company culture and improve the company's ability to make quick decisions in a fast-changing industry environment.  The decision by Ford, and its board of directors, is similar to the decision made in 2006 when the company was in a financial tailspin and brought in Alan Mulally, an executive from Boeing. Ford is seeking to recapture the magic of an outsider's insight and expertise. "It's hard to do," Bill Ford said. "But Jim is a change agent." Then, as now, Ford hired a CEO that he hopes will help the automaker make decisions faster and who will break down bureaucratic barriers between workers. Also then, as now, Wall Street was losing confidence in the automaker. "He is really a proven transformation leader. He is a visionary leader. We have always clicked when thinking about the future," Ford said in reference to Hackett. "He will continue to transform the culture of Ford Motor Co. — the culture of caring about each other, the culture about caring about the company." Hackett, 62, had been heading the automaker's "mobility" division and was a favorite of Bill Ford. His appointment came as a surprise at a company not known for them. He replaces Mark Fields, who rose up the ranks of Ford's management over a 28-year career to become CEO in 2014. "Ford is no stranger to looking outside of the house of Dearborn for someone to affect radical change," Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas said in a research note Monday. "This time, Ford is looking for the former CEO of Steelcase and current head of Ford Smart Mobility LLC to reposition the company in a world of (electric vehicles), shared mobility and autonomous driving." Related: Who is Jim Hackett? Ford's likely next CEO overhauled Steelcase Ford to cut 1,400 salaried jobs in North America, Asia Ford to shareholders: We're frustrated by stock price, too Bill Ford said he promised himself that he would not make a comparison between Hackett and Mulally, even though it's inevitable. Both are outsiders;  both come from manufacturing industries. And in both cases, Ford was able to develop an instant bond with the men. "I will break this rule just once in saying Alan really captured the hearts and minds of our employees and made them feel that not only could we win, but that we were going to win, and we are going to have fun on the journey. And I think that's something very much you will see with Jim," Ford said. The automaker needs to reinvent itself as a more efficient company, poised to capitalize on a future in which people may not drive or own their own vehicles. Investors are bracing for seismic changes to sweep through the transportation sector — potentially making car ownership unnecessary for millions of consumers in an autonomous, ride-sharing world. Nothing short of major transformation will impress them. While Ford's decision to overhaul its management team was embraced by Wall Street analysts, it did not do much for the company's stock: Ford's stock increased 23 cents, or 2%, to close at $11.10 per share. Close bond Another similarity between Mulally and Hackett is an apparent close, personal bond with Ford. Hackett joined Ford's board of directors in 2013 and became chairman of a new subsidiary called Ford Smart Mobility, but Bill Ford and Hackett have known each other for years. At a media event in January, they were virtually inseparable. Bill Ford repeatedly praised the former furniture executive for his outside-the-box thinking and leadership. "Bill Ford and Jim Hackett have developed a close relationship while developing the company's future mobility strategy," said Michelle Krebs, executive analyst at Kelley Blue Book. Building on 'One Ford' Mulally's answer to Ford's troubles in 2006 was to sell most of the brands it had accumulated and focus primarily on the Ford brand. Mulally also worked tirelessly to create a team-oriented environment and to change the culture from one that was legendary for backstabbing among executives. But while Mulally's "One Ford" strategy saved the company from Chapter 11 bankruptcy, it also established a management structure that is too complicated for today's fast-moving world, Hackett said. "He created a matrix structure. The power of that was to get the people all over the world working together. And they had mastery of that," Hackett said. Hackett said one of his first priorities is to simplify the decision-making process, with fewer people involved in setting the company's strategic direction. Ford has been earning billions annually, driven in part by a seven-year growth period in U.S. industry sales. Fields, as CEO, oversaw the launch of an all-new F-150 pickup with an aluminum body — a technological achievement that bolstered sales and profits from the company's top-selling vehicle. Fields also led Ford's effort to transform itself into and "automotive and a mobility company," as it works towards launching a fully autonomous vehicle by 2021. Still, Ford's stock price has declined by 40% since Fields became CEO, and there is a feeling among analysts that Ford has fallen behind rival General Motors when it comes to autonomous vehicles. Fields, 56, also had the unenviable task of replacing an "almost larger-than-life figure in the history of Ford Motor Co.," Kelley Blue Book analyst Karl Brauer said. "You're never going to look as good." As pressure from shareholders and Wall Street mounted, Ford's board of directors met Friday to talk about the management team and the company's future.  The decision to ask Fields to resign was made during that meeting, Ford said. "Then, following that, Mark and I got together and Mark and I decided it was the right time for him to resign, and he came to that conclusion," Ford said. "So (Hackett) has had less than 72 hours in terms of his thinking." And yet, Hackett's appointment was just one of several adjustments made to the management team. Both Jim Farley, who had been president of Europe, and Joe Hinrichs, who had been president of the Americas, now will have global roles. And both men gained the title of executive vice president. The company also appointed Marcy Klevorn to executive vice president and president, Mobility. Klevorn will oversee Ford Smart Mobility, as well as information technology and global data, insight and analytics.  Last week, Ford paid restricted stock bonuses to several senior executives under its long-term incentive program, including Farley, Klevorn, product development chief Raj Nair and Ford’s head of purchasing, Hau Thai-Tang. "No decision like this is made hastily," Ford said. "And there had been discussions for some time." Barclays analyst Brian Johnson predicts Hackett will serve as CEO for three to four years while the board further evaluates Hinrichs and Farley. "It appears both are vying to take over as CEO after Hackett’s work is complete," Johnson said. Making Ford fun While both Bill Ford and Hackett praised Fields for his accomplishments, they also repeatedly said working at Ford needs to be fun even as the company heads into a period of declining U.S. sales. Last week, Ford announced plans to reduce its global salaried workforce by 1,400. When asked if there are more job cuts coming for either salaried or hourly workers, Hackett said the company will continue to evaluate its performance. Johnson predicts Hackett may push for faster and deeper job cuts in any under-performing divisions. But Stephanie Brinley, an analyst with IHS Automotive, said that it’s important to remember how Ford is doing currently when considering the changes. “We aren’t talking about a company that is in dire straits and is performing poorly,” Brinley said, noting that the moves are expected to make a fairly strong company stronger. “We’re not talking about an emergency situation.” Hackett said his expertise is in developing a vision for a company and creating teams to work together towards a clear goal. "We want people coming to work thinking they can have a great day here," Hackett said.  It's the same type of "feel-good" emotion Hackett invoked during a 16-month stretch, from October 2014 to March 2016, as interim athletic director at the University of Michigan. At the time that he took the job, Hackett said, the school had lost its focus on its core sport — football. "We got that re-centered and now the university is doing really well," he said. Hackett helped to recruit and hire Jim Harbaugh as the head coach of the football team — a move that led to the transformation of the team from mediocre back to the top of the division. Ford said he wants Hackett to bring that spirit to the Blue Oval. "One of the things that has frustrated me over the years is our obsession over hierarchy," Ford said. "If we really are going to get the best out of our employees and really get true teamwork, then we are going to have to bend that notion of hierarchy within the company."

Promote your Business on Economictimes.com for free and reach out to millions of potential Customers List Your Business Find Service Near You China and Russia teamed up to develop twin-aisle jets that will compete with Airbus SE and Boeing Co., the plane makers who dominate passenger aircraft capable of trans-continental flights. State-owned Commercial Aircraft Corp. of China Ltd. and Russia’s United Aircraft Corp. aim to hand over the plane to customers by 2025-2027, UAC Chairman Yury Slyusar said at a briefing in Shanghai Monday. The new plane will need “billions of US dollars” in investment, he said. The venture will develop a 280-seat aircraft that can fly about 12,000 kilometres (7,500 miles) or more than the distance between London and Singapore. Earlier this month, Comac’s C919, China’s first modern passenger jet, took off on its maiden test flight from Shanghai as the nation tries to break into the near-duopoly of Airbus and Boeing in the market for planes with more than 100 seats. President Xi Jinping’s ‘Made in China 2025’ program has identified aerospace among sectors that could help turn the country into an advanced economy. The large jet’s research and development will be in Moscow while assembly will be in Shanghai, Comac Chairman Jin Zhuanglong said. The companies will seek out an engine supplier for the program and tenders will be sent by the end of the year and for components, next year, said Guo Bozhi, an assistant president at Comac in charge of the project. The China-Russia 280-seat plane will compete against models including Airbus’s A330 and Boeing’s 777, twin-aisle aircraft that are mostly used for trans-continental flights. Cheaper costs will be one of the advantages of the new plane, Guo said.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 23 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman What is Next for 3D Printing After China’s First Commercial Airliner Maiden Flight? Press Release What is Next for 3D Printing After China’s First Commercial Airliner Maiden Flight? 21 May 2017 BEIJING, May 23rd, 2017 – The first China built commercial airliner C919 took its maiden flight on 5th May, 2017 at Shanghai Pudong International Airport. This marks a historical moment in China’s aviation industry. C919 was developed by the Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China Ltd (COMAC), who used 3D printing technologies and specialty metals like titanium alloys in the developments of the airliner. COMAC designed and assembled C919 in Shanghai while the parts of the airliner were manufactured by different suppliers in China. Front parts and wings were made in Chengdu and Xi’an. The main body parts were made in Nanchang. The “Made in China 2025” master plan sets the routes for China to radically transform its traditional manufacturing economy. The successful maiden flight of C919 has demonstrated China’s ambitions and determination to compete with the high-end manufacturing sector in the West. The “Made in China 2025” master plan focuses on 10 sectors – one of which is the development of aerospace equipment, as well as 3D Printing. The government recognizes that 3D Printing is a strong enabler to China manufacturing’s overall growth. 3D printed titanium parts were installed on C919 to reduce the airliner weight and increase its safety. Twenty-eight cabin door parts and two fan inlet structural parts were installed on C919. The existing parts on C919 were largely made in China, or around 60% vs the original target of only 10%. However, critical parts were still made by foreign suppliers namely CFM International, Liebher-Aerospace, FACC and Honeywell. CFM International supplied the jet engines and Liebher-Aerospace made the landing gear. Honeywell made the flight control systems, wheels, brakes, auxiliary power units and navigation systems while FACC supplied the cockpit. The next target is to increase the parts made locally to 90% and install made-in-China jet engines by 2025. The aggressive development of China’s aviation industry will lead to increasing demand for 3D printers and metal powders. “We will see more use cases on the adoption of 3D printing technologies in the aerospace industry. For instance, General Electric (GE) acquired two metal 3D printer manufacturers, Concept Laser and Arcam, in which they have been providing 3D printers to aircraft parts manufacturers. Jet engine manufacturer Rolls Royce is one of Arcam’s users. Norsk Titanium produces the first Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) approved 3D printed structural titanium components for Boeing Dreamliner,” says Wendy Mok, Research Manager of IDC’s Imaging Printing and Document Solutions research. Mok adds, “In China, the success of C919’s maiden flight implies the use of 3D printed parts on airliners have been recognized by the aviation industry in China. The domestic demand for 3D printed parts will grow with expectations that the orders of 570 units of C919 delivered by COMAC in the future, coupled with an increase in localization rate.” Suppliers of C919 parts have proven the value of adopting 3D printing in the manufacturing process. Metal 3D printers of foreign brands were used by FalconTech, who supplied a total of 30 metal 3D printed parts to C919. Due to its reliability and numerous successful use cases in related industries, imported 3D printers have held a significant competitive advantage over domestic ones in China’s high-end manufacturing sectors. However, it could create financial burden and resources allocation problems to the manufacturers who carry different 3D printers. “Outsourcing 3D printing services will save the initial investment cost and enables the manufacturers to focus on product development. Moreover, individual suppliers could provide services and parts according to their product portfolios. Such collaborations will help improve the overall product quality. This business model also provides 3D printer vendors a point of penetration,” Mok added. “The local aircraft makers will not be the only ones to benefit from the growing aviation industry, with foreign companies also looking at China’s airliner market. Boeing is planning to build a facility in China while Airbus have started to assemble their A320s in Tianjin. Moreover, parts supplied by foreign companies could be made in China as well. The huge domestic demand on airliners is attracting more market players and competition. This will further push the growth of 3D printing industry in terms of both hardware and materials,” Mok added. According to the IDC Worldwide Semiannual 3D Printer Tracker, China’s metal-based 3D Printer market size in 2016 is 181 units and we expect this to grow 4 times in 3 years’ time. The successful maiden flight of C919 has made the usage of 3D printing technologies a role model in China’s manufacturing sector. The brand effect of C919 will further promote the development and applications of innovative technologies. More and more companies are expected to adopt 3D printing technologies in their production process. To achieve the targets set in ‘Made in China 2025’ master plan, the Chinese government will allocate more resources to push the transformation and development of high-end manufacturing sectors. Besides aerospace industry, railways (bullet train) and automotive industries are expected to accelerate their transformation. These activities will induce the demand for advanced 3D printing technology and diversity of materials. “Market players like 3D printer vendors, material suppliers and service bureaus should have a comprehensive understanding on the market segments and their related development trends. With the right market positioning and entry point, these market players will be able to gain more return on the fast-growing 3D printing market,” ended Mok. – Ends – For inquiries on this tracker research, please contact Wendy Mok wmok@idc.com or your IDC account manager.

(AP Photo/Richard Drew, File) NEW YORK — US stocks are higher yesterday as the market bounces back from a turbulent week. Defense contractors are making gains and technology and consumer-focused companies are also rising. Ford is up after it replaced CEO Mark Fields, while chemicals maker Huntsman is rising after it agreed to combine with Swiss competitor Clariant. KEEPING SCORE: The Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 6 points, or 0.3 percent, to 2,388 as of 11:15 a.m. Eastern time. The Dow Jones industrial average added 73 points, or 0.4 percent, to 20,877. The Nasdaq composite gained 30 points, or 0.5 percent, to 6,113. The Russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks picked up 4 points, or 0.3 percent, to 1,371. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq both set records early last week before worries about growing political uncertainty in Washington, and its potential effects on President Trump's agenda of tax cuts and deregulation, knocked those indexes back from their highs. The S&P 500 is about 1 percent below its highest close, but the Russell 2000 is down more than 3 percent from the record it set one month ago. AEROSPACE GAINS ALTITUDE: Aerospace and defense companies traded higher after President Trump presided over a $110 billion sale of military equipment to Saudi Arabia. The agreement could expand to $350 billion over 10 years. It appeared to reverse an Obama administration to pause sales of precision-guided munitions to the kingdom. Lockheed Martin climbed $5.35, or 2 percent, to $278.14 and Boeing gained $2.59, or 1.4 percent, to $183.35. Rockwell Automation rose $1.55, or 1 percent, to $158.91. DRIVEN OFF: Ford replaced CEO Mark Fields as the automaker struggles to keep the traditional parts of its business running smoothly while it remakes itself as a nimble, high-tech provider of new mobility services. Fields was CEO for three years, but under his leadership popular cars like the Fusion sedan became dated and Ford lagged competitors in bringing long-range electric cars to market. New CEO is Jim Hackett, who has led Ford's mobility unit for more than a year. Ford added 15 cents, or 1.3 percent, to $11.02. The stock is down 9 percent this year.

The company will call itself HuntsmanClariant and Clariant shareholders will own 52 percent of the new company. Huntsman stock was unchanged at $26.71 and Clariant stock rose 5.8 percent in Switzerland. METAL TESTED: Arconic jumped after the aluminum products company ended a contentious proxy dispute with activist investor Elliott Management. Elliott will get more input as Arconic picks its next CEO, and it will nominate three directors to the company's board. Arconic agreed to nominate two others, and a third board member resigned and was replaced by a candidate Arconic chose. A month ago, Klaus Kleinfeld was ousted as Arconic's chairman and CEO after he sent a threatening letter to Paul Singer, Elliott's founder and Arconic's largest shareholder. Arconic stock gained 32 cents, or 1.1 percent, to $27.90. ENERGY: Oil prices continued to rally and benchmark US crude oil added 51 cents, or 1 percent, to $50.84 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, rose 49 cents to $54.10 a barrel in London. However energy companies traded lower. Halliburton lost 79 cents, or 1.7 percent, to $46.99 and Chevron declined 52 cents to $106. BONDS: Bond prices were little changed. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note remained at 2.24 percent. CURRENCIES: The dollar dipped to 110.97 yen from 111.20 yen late Friday. The euro rose to $1.1243s from $1.1205. OVERSEAS: In Britain, the FTSE 100 gained 0.3 percent.

The Onion imagines Trump's presidential briefings as looking like one of those paper placemats that children doodle on in family restaurants.  (Courtesy of the Onion)   By Abby OhlheiserThe Washington Post Mon., May 22, 2017 The fast pace of events under U.S. President Donald Trump has some good news and some bad news for the Onion and the rest of the Internet’s satirists. The good news is, there’s a lot of material to work with. The bad? There’s so much material, churning through the news cycle at such a speedy pace, that it becomes tough to interject with a joke. “We had a ton of great articles about various parts of the campaign, Trump’s personality and the people around him,” Onion editor-in-chief Cole Bolton said in an interview with the Washington Post on Friday. “But we felt like each one of those is a drop in the bucket.” So, the Onion is trying something new: Why not flood the Internet with a ton of jokes about the Trump administration, all at once? The Trump Documents, released by the Onion on Monday, are the satirical newspaper’s fictional version of the Pentagon Papers. It’s about 700 pages of fake executive order drafts, emails and classified “documents” that, collectively, are the Onion’s first big swing at capturing this particular political moment. Bolton calls it a mix of “really hard satire” about the administration, its people and its goals, along with some more traditional Onion-y silliness. It’s all supposed to have the feel of a major leak of classified documents. The Trump Documents, in a way, are an attempt at finding a way to produce effective work — in the Onion’s case, satire — in a world where expectations have changed. It’s not that Trump is hard to satirize. It’s that there’s too much to satirize. Article Continued Below “We just couldn’t keep up all the time,” Bolton said. “There was just so much to ridicule that it got to be such a drag. I’m sure it’s the same way with regular journalism, just following him all the time would be just tiring.” The Onion is hoping that by flooding the Internet, it will be able to get readers to pause for a moment and take it all in. It is also planning about two weeks of “coverage” of its project — everything from editorials to a Facebook Live rollout, to tweets featuring individual documents from the massive trove. The coverage will mimic the seriousness of a real newspaper covering a major government leak. In one document, Trump is arguing with Boeing’s chief executive about the decor for Air Force One. “Whole interior should be marble,” Trump writes in a (fake) email. “Not just floor.” He wants marble walls, marble doors, marble bathroom fixtures, marble seats, with headrests that are adjustable and marble. The chief executive replies that “it’s just not possible to use marble for every element of the plane’s interior.” Trump persists, he emails back a drawing where every part of the plane is labelled “marble.” There also are fictional memos to Trump from U.S. Vice President Mike Pence, which read as if they were written by Cotton Mather. One lists “heretics” in Congress and their suspected crimes (Sen. Elizabeth Warren, for instance, is “head witch”), while another warns the president of a “potential violation” of the First Commandment in the Bible. The Onion also took a stab at imagining one of Trump’s presidential briefings. It looks like one of those paper placemats that children doodle on in family restaurants. Bolton estimates that a staff of 20 graphics editors and writers spent “thousands” of hours collectively on the project, which began production shortly after Trump’s inauguration. “It’s been my life, it’s been my first 100 days of the Trump administration,” Bolton said. The hope, he added, is that the Internet will embrace the project as an injection of “humorous catharsis during a very unusual political time,” one that rises above the incremental absurdities of the Internet’s response to these past few months. There’s another possibility, too: What if people actually believe the Onion documents are real? One of the strange things about satire on the internet recently has been how believable it is. For instance, a Twitter humorist photoshopped the ending of a New York Times story recently to make it appear as if Speaker of the House Paul Ryan drove away from the White House blaring Papa Roach’s “Last Resort.” The humorist had to later clarify that his tweet was just a joke, after a ton of people believed it was a real thing that happened in 2017. And before Trump’s election, there were hoaxes involving faked emails from the Democratic National Committee, including one that tricked viewers into thinking a Hillary Clinton aide had referred to America’s military as a bunch of “idiot soldiers.” The Trump Documents, too, look believable, even if the content within them is clearly absurd. Bolton said that his staff spent time tracking down the exact letterheads and fonts to make each document look as authentic as possible. Some pages involve hand-drawn doodles. The rest were printed out after creation and manually re-scanned back into a digital form, to make each image look more like it was really leaked. “It is on our mind,” Bolton said of the possibility that these documents might trick someone into thinking they’re real. But the Onion’s style has always closely mimicked the news it parodies, and the Trump Documents are no different. “I think the reason that the satire sings is because it mimics, say, the Washington Post so closely. We use really dry AP style writing in our headlines,” he said. “We never wink, we never break character.” It seems inevitable that someone is going to think something in this massive trove of 700 very authentic looking documents is the real deal, particularly if individual pages are removed from their original context, as tends to happen on the Internet. But Bolton and his team are hoping that the jokes manage to make themselves clear for what they are. “I hope the satirical stuff resonates with people,” Bolton said. “I think the highest compliment we ever get on our articles — and hopefully on this — is ‘Oh, the Onion nailed it, the Onion captured it perfectly.’ We kind of want it to feel like we captured a moment in the zeitgeist.” Read more about: Donald Trump Delivered dailyThe Morning Headlines Newsletter Subscribe The Toronto Star and thestar.com, each property of Toronto Star Newspapers Limited, One Yonge Street, 4th Floor, Toronto, ON, M5E 1E6.

If they succeed, this will be the first rocket launched into space from New Zealand, making us the 11th country to do so. After high winds scrubbed a launch attempt yesterday, Rocket Lab is currently preparing for blast off today, though another postponement is possible. The SMC gathered expert reaction from international experts about what makes the Electron rocket different and where Rocket Lab sits in the independent space market. Feel free to use these comments in your reporting. Professor Martin Barstow, University of Leicester, Director of the Leicester Institute of Space & Earth Observation, comments: Where does this launch sit in the scheme of what else is currently happening in the industry? “I see this as part of the new spirit of commercial enterprise developing around low cost access to space, of which Space-X is a prime example. In the current context Rocket Lab are not so well advanced, as they have yet to carry out their first launch. Also, their 225kg payload mass is rather smaller than other capabilities. However, I think there will be a growing need for launch capability for lower mass satellites like this to build satellite constellations. So, if successful, they will be well-placed to support and exploit that market.” What is Rocket Lab’s competitive edge and is their business model viable? “It’s not clear to me how their business model functions (since I can’t find their pricing structure), but as mentioned above, they will be hitting an emerging market.” What is new or different about the Electron rocket technology they have developed? “I think the use of 3-D printing techniques to produce key components is very novel and likely to lower production costs, giving them a pricing edge. It could also help with reliability.” Are there any advantages for launching from New Zealand? “There are no particular advantages in launching from NZ, compared to existing sites. In fact the best launch sites are closer to the equator to get the maximum advantage from the Earth’s rotation. “So, this is more about developing independent capability, so that the country does not have to rely on launch services from elsewhere. There is a similar issue in the UK where our government is keen to develop launch site opportunities. It’s actually more difficult here due to the proximity of Europe. From New Zealand, you can launch safely over the Pacific.” How are private ventures like Rocket Lab and SpaceX etc changing access to space? “This is really about lower costs and creating true commercial (and profitable) markets for space services to drive future space activities.” Is only launching small payloads viable? “No, but the current rocket is only capable of launching small/medium payloads at the moment. However, once a successful track record is developed, it is possible to scale-up the systems, as Space-X did.” Other comments: “I wish them luck! It’s a very exciting project, but getting into space is hard and success is not guaranteed.” ________________________________________ Dr George Sowers, Independent consultant, former Chief Scientist and Vice-President of United Launch Alliance, a joint venture of Lockheed Martin and Boeing, comments: Where does this launch sit in the scheme of what else is currently happening in the industry? “The Rocket Lab launch is another indication of the vibrancy of the commercial space sector at the present time. It is another entrant into the small payload launch market which has been tough for commercial companies to succeed in. It certainly represents a first for New Zealand.” What is Rocket Lab’s competitive edge and is their business model viable? “Rocket Lab has some interesting technology such as the electric pump driven engine. And they have embraced the state of the art manufacturing technologies. However the small payload launch market is extremely difficult for commercial companies to make a profit. “There are several reasons for this. First, the small payload market is not robust. There are many potential customers, but few are able to afford the price of a dedicated launch. On the bright side, there is some indication that the market might be picking up, for example with companies like Planet. “Second there is fierce competition from nations (India, China, Russia, etc) and larger launchers offering small payload launches as rideshare. Plus, there are a number of other companies vying for the same market. If Rocket Lab succeeds, they will be the first commercial company to do so in the small market. Many have failed, including SpaceX, who discontinued the Falcon 1 small launcher after only a handful of launches.” What is new or different about the Electron rocket technology they have developed? “The electric pump power engine is unique. However, it is not clear it has advantages over traditional turbo-pump designs in terms of either cost, reliability or performance.” Are there any advantages for launching from New Zealand? “Range availability might be an advantage (less congestion). However, the southern latitude limits customers to high inclination orbits, precluding a portion of the market. It is also a long journey for American or European customers, representing most of the market.” How are private ventures like Rocket Lab and SpaceX etc changing the access to space? “Still to be determined for Rocket Labs. SpaceX has disrupted the traditional launch markets, forcing other competitors to transform their business models, at least for the short term. SpaceX has had a number of technological successes, but it remains to be seen if their business model will succeed in the long term.” Is only launching small payloads viable? “If the market improves, perhaps. I believe it unlikely due to factors explained above.” Other comments: I wish them luck. Kris Walsh, Former project manager at United Launch Alliance and former director of all NASA launch programmes for Boeing, comments: Where does this launch sit in the scheme of what else is currently happening in the industry? “I was the Program Manager of the launch that had the first successful CubeSat launches, and Delta and Atlas continue to launch CubeSats for NASA successfully. The biggest frustration for these small satellites is access to space — they have to wait until the primary payload launches – and delays are common for the larger satellites.” What is Rocket Lab’s competitive edge and is their business model viable? “What Rocket Lab offers is access to space for the smaller payloads. So, if Rocket Lab can quickly get reliable, on time launches, they can capture a market ignored by the current industry. “It will have to also shift customers expectations — payload processing should be mostly complete before the satellites arrive, reducing or eliminating the need for customer access to the launch site, customer viewing would be virtual, etc. “I also think the $7M price tag for 3 CubeSats is a higher price than many of the scientific payloads of this size can support. So, it would be commercial ventures. “Any comparison to SpaceX is not realistic. SpaceX’s long term plan was to continue to increase the size of their rockets, and to capture the larger US government payloads. SpaceX did not significantly change access to space for commercial ventures.” Is only launching small payloads viable? “Rocket Lab could if 1) they stick to their business model and target small (nano) payloads, especially constellations, 2) they are technically successful both in launch reliability and on-time launches, and 3) they focus on a ship and shoot launch process, minimizing Rocket Lab’s expenses as well as its customers.” ends Content Sourced from scoop.co.nz Original url Trackback-URL  Print This Post comments feed for this post Tweet   No comments yet.

Eisenstein Share Share Tweet Comment Email Print advertisement Former Ford CEO Mark Fields fashioned himself an agent of change, promising to transform a Rust Belt auto manufacturer into a high-tech "mobility company." But three years after taking the helm, Fields has been tripped up by changes beyond his own control. The 56-year-old New York native was summarily sent out to pasture, Ford announced Monday, replaced by former Steelcase CEO Jim Hackett. That, along with a series of other high-level management moves, appears to have been months in the making, reflecting the growing frustration among major investors — including the founding Ford family — over weak sales, declining earnings and a stock price down 40 percent since Fields stepped into the CEO role in July 2014.

"He put us in a great position. I'm very thankful to Mark. But this is a time of great change and fortunately we have a transformational leader," Ford said, referring to new CEO Hackett. Officially, Fields tendered his resignation last Friday, "after a discussion he and I had," Chairman Ford said during a subsequent interview on CNBC. But the speed with which a successor was named suggested to industry observers it was only a matter of time, and a question of whether Fields, a 28-year Ford veteran, would jump or be pushed. Field Marshaled in Change Things looked a lot more promising just three years ago, when Fields stepped in for the retiring Alan Mulally. Fields was the protégé of the former Boeing executive, who guided Ford through the Great Recession. It was, in fact, Fields who largely crafted the "Way Forward" plan that let the second-largest U.S. automaker avoid the bankruptcies that nearly destroyed Detroit rivals General Motors and Chrysler. But, after a promising start, a number of factors came into play leading to the management shake-up. "There's no question that all of us were acutely aware that the stock had been languishing," the Ford chairman acknowledged. But there has been growing concern that while Fields had a clear vision of where the auto industry is heading five, even 10 years from now, his grasp of current challenges may have been a bit more murky. In recent years, Fields had been a frequent speaker at the Consumer Electronics Show, underscoring the way the automobile is becoming as much a digital device as a mechanical one. Under his leadership, Ford has rapidly expanded its spending on technology, early this year ordering a major expansion of its new Silicon Valley research center. Technology Up Front Barely a month ago Ford announced a three-way venture with Amazon and Starbucks that will allow motorists with the latest Ford Sync 3 infotainment system to call up the Alexa voice assistant and use it to have a cup of java waiting when they pull into the nearby coffee shop. Ford was hailed by a recent Navigant Research study that declared it the industry leader in development of autonomous vehicles, ahead of Waymo, the self-driving spin-off from Google. Ford plans to have its first fully driverless vehicle in production by 2021. The carmaker has launched car-sharing and ride-sharing projects and is exploring a variety of other new mobility concepts. If one bought into Fields's vision, that is essential, as there will likely be far fewer consumers buying cars in 2025 than there are today, many owners expected to switch to sharing services like Uber and Lyft. Related: Why 95 Percent of Your Driving Won't Be in Your Own Car by 2030 Fields also was betting that those car-share services would opt for electric, rather than gas-powered models. In many ways, his vision echoed that of Elon Musk, and Wall Street has embraced Tesla — last month driving its stock up to the point it had a higher market capitalization than either Ford or General Motors. But the message failed to resonate with Ford investors — especially after the carmaker saw first-quarter sales dip 40 percent to $1.6 billion, with the full-year numbers also expected to decline. "It will be many years before a lot of the stuff Fields has been working on will achieve a payoff," said Joe Phillippi, a long-time Wall Street analyst and now head of AutoTrends Consulting. Having a long-term vision isn't a bad thing, Phillippi stressed, but critics contend Fields lost sight of Ford's short-term challenges. Its passenger car fleet, models like the Fusion and Focus, have been allowed to age without necessary replacements. It has been slow to recognize and respond to some key market shifts, as well — notably the revival of the midsize pickup truck segment. General Motors got there in 2014 with models like the Chevrolet Silverado. Ford's reborn Ranger truck is still a year away.

On October 30, 2001, Ford gave walking papers to Jacques Nasser, another visionary leader who set out to create a very different Ford. Nasser was an early proponent of in-car technologies. He also spent heavily on non-traditional operations, like auto parts and repairs and recycling. But critics felt he ignored the core of Ford's business and, after Nasser's ouster, Bill Ford — then handling dual roles as chairman and CEO — adopted a strategy dubbed "One Ford." That led the Detroit maker to return focus to its core brand, selling off a host of foreign luxury marques, including Volvo, Land Rover and Jaguar, that Nasser had acquired at a premium. While the "Blue Oval" Ford brand quickly rebounded, Mulally eventually killed off domestic Mercury, too. And even now, Lincoln, the homegrown luxury division, continues to struggle. How much CEO Hackett will reverse the course set by Fields is uncertain. He was, in fact, heading Ford's Smart Mobility unit for the last year, so Hackett seems unlikely to completely walk away from many of the projects Fields set in motion. But Chairman Ford made it clear the new chief executive also will have to not only "drive innovation" for the long haul, but improve the carmaker's cost efficiencies and "deliver results around the world."

If they succeed, this will be the first rocket launched into space from New Zealand, making us the 11th country to do so. After high winds scrubbed a launch attempt yesterday, Rocket Lab is currently preparing for blast off today, though another postponement is possible. The SMC gathered expert reaction from international experts about what makes the Electron rocket different and where Rocket Lab sits in the independent space market. Feel free to use these comments in your reporting. Professor Martin Barstow, University of Leicester, Director of the Leicester Institute of Space & Earth Observation, comments: Where does this launch sit in the scheme of what else is currently happening in the industry? "I see this as part of the new spirit of commercial enterprise developing around low cost access to space, of which Space-X is a prime example. In the current context Rocket Lab are not so well advanced, as they have yet to carry out their first launch. Also, their 225kg payload mass is rather smaller than other capabilities. However, I think there will be a growing need for launch capability for lower mass satellites like this to build satellite constellations. So, if successful, they will be well-placed to support and exploit that market." What is Rocket Lab's competitive edge and is their business model viable? "It's not clear to me how their business model functions (since I can't find their pricing structure), but as mentioned above, they will be hitting an emerging market." What is new or different about the Electron rocket technology they have developed? "I think the use of 3-D printing techniques to produce key components is very novel and likely to lower production costs, giving them a pricing edge. It could also help with reliability." Are there any advantages for launching from New Zealand? "There are no particular advantages in launching from NZ, compared to existing sites. In fact the best launch sites are closer to the equator to get the maximum advantage from the Earth’s rotation. "So, this is more about developing independent capability, so that the country does not have to rely on launch services from elsewhere. There is a similar issue in the UK where our government is keen to develop launch site opportunities. It's actually more difficult here due to the proximity of Europe. From New Zealand, you can launch safely over the Pacific." How are private ventures like Rocket Lab and SpaceX etc changing access to space? "This is really about lower costs and creating true commercial (and profitable) markets for space services to drive future space activities." Is only launching small payloads viable? "No, but the current rocket is only capable of launching small/medium payloads at the moment. However, once a successful track record is developed, it is possible to scale-up the systems, as Space-X did." Other comments: "I wish them luck! It’s a very exciting project, but getting into space is hard and success is not guaranteed." ________________________________________ Dr George Sowers, Independent consultant, former Chief Scientist and Vice-President of United Launch Alliance, a joint venture of Lockheed Martin and Boeing, comments: Where does this launch sit in the scheme of what else is currently happening in the industry? "The Rocket Lab launch is another indication of the vibrancy of the commercial space sector at the present time. It is another entrant into the small payload launch market which has been tough for commercial companies to succeed in. It certainly represents a first for New Zealand." What is Rocket Lab's competitive edge and is their business model viable? "Rocket Lab has some interesting technology such as the electric pump driven engine. And they have embraced the state of the art manufacturing technologies. However the small payload launch market is extremely difficult for commercial companies to make a profit. "There are several reasons for this. First, the small payload market is not robust. There are many potential customers, but few are able to afford the price of a dedicated launch. On the bright side, there is some indication that the market might be picking up, for example with companies like Planet. "Second there is fierce competition from nations (India, China, Russia, etc) and larger launchers offering small payload launches as rideshare. Plus, there are a number of other companies vying for the same market. If Rocket Lab succeeds, they will be the first commercial company to do so in the small market. Many have failed, including SpaceX, who discontinued the Falcon 1 small launcher after only a handful of launches." What is new or different about the Electron rocket technology they have developed? "The electric pump power engine is unique. However, it is not clear it has advantages over traditional turbo-pump designs in terms of either cost, reliability or performance." Are there any advantages for launching from New Zealand? "Range availability might be an advantage (less congestion). However, the southern latitude limits customers to high inclination orbits, precluding a portion of the market. It is also a long journey for American or European customers, representing most of the market." How are private ventures like Rocket Lab and SpaceX etc changing the access to space? "Still to be determined for Rocket Labs. SpaceX has disrupted the traditional launch markets, forcing other competitors to transform their business models, at least for the short term. SpaceX has had a number of technological successes, but it remains to be seen if their business model will succeed in the long term." Is only launching small payloads viable? "If the market improves, perhaps. I believe it unlikely due to factors explained above." Other comments: I wish them luck. Kris Walsh, Former project manager at United Launch Alliance and former director of all NASA launch programmes for Boeing, comments: Where does this launch sit in the scheme of what else is currently happening in the industry? "I was the Program Manager of the launch that had the first successful CubeSat launches, and Delta and Atlas continue to launch CubeSats for NASA successfully. The biggest frustration for these small satellites is access to space -- they have to wait until the primary payload launches - and delays are common for the larger satellites." What is Rocket Lab's competitive edge and is their business model viable? "What Rocket Lab offers is access to space for the smaller payloads. So, if Rocket Lab can quickly get reliable, on time launches, they can capture a market ignored by the current industry. "It will have to also shift customers expectations -- payload processing should be mostly complete before the satellites arrive, reducing or eliminating the need for customer access to the launch site, customer viewing would be virtual, etc. "I also think the $7M price tag for 3 CubeSats is a higher price than many of the scientific payloads of this size can support. So, it would be commercial ventures. "Any comparison to SpaceX is not realistic. SpaceX's long term plan was to continue to increase the size of their rockets, and to capture the larger US government payloads. SpaceX did not significantly change access to space for commercial ventures." Is only launching small payloads viable? "Rocket Lab could if 1) they stick to their business model and target small (nano) payloads, especially constellations, 2) they are technically successful both in launch reliability and on-time launches, and 3) they focus on a ship and shoot launch process, minimizing Rocket Lab's expenses as well as its customers." ends © Scoop Media Science Media Centre NZ Our aim is to promote accurate, evidence-based reporting on science and technology by helping the media work more closely with the scientific community.

The good news is, there's a lot of material to work with. The bad? There's so much material, churning through the news cycle at such a speedy pace, that it becomes tough to interject with a joke. "We had a ton of great articles about various parts of the campaign, Trump's personality, and the people around him," Onion Editor in Chief Cole Bolton said in an interview with The Washington Post on Friday. "But we felt like each one of those is a drop in the bucket." So, the Onion is trying something new: Why not flood the Internet with a ton of jokes about the Trump administration, all at once? The Trump Documents, released by the Onion on Monday, are the satirical newspaper's fictional version of the Pentagon Papers. It's about 700 pages of fake executive order drafts, emails and classified "documents" that, collectively, are the Onion's first big swing at capturing this particular political moment. Bolton calls it a mix of "really hard satire" about the administration, its people and its goals, along with some more traditional Oniony silliness. It's all supposed to have the feel of a major leak of classified documents. The Trump Documents, in a way, are an attempt at finding a way to produce effective work — in the Onion's case, satire — in a world where expectations have changed. It's not that Trump is hard to satirize. It's that there's too much to satirize. "We just couldn't keep up all the time," Bolton said. "There was just so much to ridicule that it got to be such a drag. I'm sure it's the same way with regular journalism, just following him all the time would be just tiring." The Onion is hoping that by flooding the Internet, it will be able to get readers to pause for a moment and take it all in. It is also planning about two weeks of "coverage" of its project — everything from editorials to a Facebook Live rollout, to tweets featuring individual documents from the massive trove. The coverage will mimic the seriousness of a real newspaper covering a major government leak. In one document, Trump is arguing with Boeing's chief executive about the decor for Air Force One. "Whole interior should be marble," Trump writes in a (fake) email. "Not just floor." He wants marble walls, marble doors, marble bathroom fixtures, marble seats, with headrests that are adjustable and marble. The chief executive replies that "it's just not possible to use marble for every element of the plane's interior." Trump persists, he emails back a drawing where every part of the plane is labelled "marble." There also are fictional memos to Trump from Vice President Mike Pence, which read as if they were written by Cotton Mather. One lists "heretics" in Congress and their suspected crimes (Sen. Elizabeth Warren, for instance, is "head witch"), while another warns the president of a "potential violation" of the First Commandment in the Bible. The Onion also took a stab at imagining one of Trump's presidential briefings. It looks like one of those paper placemats that children doodle on in family restaurants. Bolton estimates that a staff of 20 graphics editors and writers spent "thousands" of hours collectively on the project, which began production shortly after Trump's inauguration. "It's been my life, it's been my first 100 days of the Trump administration," Bolton said. The hope, he added, is that the Internet will embrace the project as an injection of "humorous catharsis during a very unusual political time," one that rises above the incremental absurdities of the Internet's response to these past few months. There's another possibility, too: What if people actually believe the Onion documents are real? One of the strange things about satire on the Internet recently has been how believable it is. For instance, a Twitter humorist photoshopped the ending of a New York Times story recently to make it appear as if Speaker of the House Paul D. Ryan drove away from the White House blaring Papa Roach's "Last Resort." The humorist had to later clarify that his tweet was just a joke, after a ton of people believed it was a real thing that happened in 2017. And before Trump's election, there were hoaxes involving faked emails from the Democratic National Committee, including one that tricked viewers into thinking a Hillary Clinton aide had referred to America's military as a bunch of "idiot soldiers." The Trump Documents, too, look believable, even if the content within them is clearly absurd. Bolton said that his staff spent time tracking down the exact letterheads and fonts to make each document look as authentic as possible. Some pages involve hand-drawn doodles. The rest were printed out after creation and manually rescanned back into a digital form, to make each image look more like it was really leaked. "It is on our mind," Bolton said of the possibility that these documents might trick someone into thinking they're real. But the Onion's style has always closely mimicked the news it parodies, and the Trump Documents are no different. "I think the reason that the satire sings is because it mimics, say, The Washington Post so closely. We use really dry AP style writing in our headlines," he said. "We never wink, we never break character." It seems inevitable that someone is going to think something in this massive trove of 700 very authentic looking documents is the real deal, particularly if individual pages are removed from their original context, as tends to happen on the Internet. But Bolton and his team are hoping that the jokes manage to make themselves clear for what they are. "I hope the satirical stuff resonates with people," Bolton said. "I think the highest compliment we ever get on our articles — and hopefully on this — is 'Oh, the Onion nailed it, the Onion captured it perfectly.' We kind of want it to feel like we captured a moment in the zeitgeist."

The deal will be worth $350 billion over 10 years. On Monday,Lockheed Martin (LMT) closed up more than 1 percent and General Dynamics (GD) closed up about 1 percent. These stocks, along with Raytheon (RTN) and Northrop Grumman (NOC), hit all-time highs earlier in the day. Additionally, the iShares U.S. Aerospace & Defense ETF (ITA) (NYSE Arca: ITA) closed nearly 1 percent higher. Jet maker Boeing (BA) also signed a handful of deals with Saudi Arabia during Trump's weekend visit, involving the sale of military and passenger aircraft. Its stock closed up more than 1 percent. These types of arms deals have caused defense stocks to rally in the past, according to CNBC analysis using Kensho. One month after about 40 U.S.-Saudi Arabia arms deals — going back to 2009 — the iShares U.S. Aerospace & Defense ETF (NYSE Arca: ITA) was up 3.3 percent, on average, almost double the return of the S&P 500 (^GSPC), according to data compiled by Kensho. "The key, and as yet unknown, issue will be (1) when/if all the various items mentioned are put under contract and (2) when they are to be delivered," Cowen analyst Cai von Rumohr wrote in a note to clients. "Given the generally extended period required to finalize foreign arms contracts, we'd expect little impact on 2017 results, with some potential benefit in 2018 and more in 2019," Rumohr said. Lockheed Martin is slated to be the biggest potential winner after this news, with Raytheon being a "potential dark horse winner," should its Patriot missile be purchased, Rumohr said. Trump's deal with the Saudis solidifies a decades-long alliance with the world's largest oil exporter and will be worth $350 billion over 10 years. Lockheed Martin said in a statement that the deal "will directly contribute to [Saudi Arabia's] Vision 2030 by opening the door for thousands of highly skilled jobs in new economic sectors." — CNBC's Javier David contributed to this report. CNBC's parent NBCUniversal is a minority investor in Kensho. Correction: President Donald Trump signed a nearly $110 billion weapons deal with Saudi Arabia. An earlier version misstated the figure.

Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) was up about 2%, Raytheon (NYSE:RTN) was up more than 1.4%, Northrop Grumman (NYSE:NOC) climbed 1%, and General Dynamics (NYSE:GD) was up about 0.5%. All 4 stocks reached all-time highs, according to the data at the close Monday.

Login Search Close Update: Stocks Trade Higher on Gains in Defense, Technology Sectors May 22, 2017, 04:34:22 PM EDT By MT Newswires, MT Newswires Shutterstock photo The major averages all closed higher for a third straight day as Wall Street applauded a multi-billion dollar weapons deal between the U.S. and Saudi Arabia amid a dearth of market-moving headlines from Washington, D.C. The industrial and technology sectors outperformed, followed by solid gains in the beaten down consumer sectors. The defense sector got a shot in the arm following news that President Trump assisted in inking a deal worth $110 billion to supply arms to Saudi Arabia. The deal includes Chinook helicopters manufactured by Boeing ( BA ), and the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system made by Lockheed Martin ( LMT ). Shares of Lockheed Martin, Raytheon ( RTN ) and General Dynamics ( GD ) all set record highs on the news. Shares of Ford ( F ) briefly touched their highest level in nearly two weeks following the ouster of CEO Mark Fields. In an attempt to boost its share price and accelerate its autonomous car program, the company named former Steelcase (SCS) CEO and current head of the company's autonomous vehicle subsidiary, Jim Hackett, as its chief executive. Hackett is known for his turnaround success at Steelcase that included a massive downsizing and focus on innovative work environments and products. Economic data was also bullish for Wall Street as the Chicago Fed national activity index rose to its highest level in more than three years of 0.49 from a revised 0.07 in March, exceeding expectations to improve to just 0.10. Tuesday's calendar includes the May preliminary purchasing manager's and Richmond Fed manufacturing indices, and new home sales. Fed watchers will get speeches from Minneapolis Fed president Neel Kashkari and Philadelphia president Patrick Harker.

Hackett was previously the head of the company’s Smart Mobility division. Today’s announcement confirms rumours that began swirling around the internet over the weekend. As noted in our earlier report, news of board-level dissatisfaction was becoming more widespread, with Fields facing a fiery round of questioning during Ford’s annual general meeting two weeks ago. Bill Ford speaks out on Fields’ retirement In an interview with CNBC today, Bill Ford, Ford Motor Company’s executive chairman, said: “I didn’t fire Mark, he chose to resign after a discussion he and I had on Friday. So, I think that’s very important. “[stammers] We only decided on Friday that I would go and talk to Mark. So, I did, and we reached this conclusion, and we moved forward with Jim Hackett.” Although Bill Ford acknowledged “all of us were acutely aware that the stock has been languishing”, he was was at pains to point out a “decision like this” wasn’t based solely on the company’s stock price. Noting “this is a time of great opportunity and great change for us”, Bill Ford said “we need to be quicker in our decision making”, and the company needed greater “clarity in our messaging and communication”. Ford’s share price has dropped from around US$17.24 ($23.16) when Fields took over to US$10.87 ($14.60) at the share market’s close on Friday, US time. Above: Jim Hackett (left) and Bill Ford (right). Jim Hackett The chairman chose to frame Fields’ retirement and Hackett’s ascension as being born from a desire to have “a leader who’s transformed a company before”. In summarising new CEO Hackett’s career, Ford said: “When he ran Steelcase, they weren’t the number one manufacturer and they defined themselves as a furniture manufacturer. He said, ‘No, let’s reimagine how the workspace of the future is going to be.’ “He did that, grew the revenues, and took the company to the number one spot in the industry.” Bill Ford also compared new CEO Hackett to Alan Mulally, the former Boeing CEO who Bill Ford brought on board in 2006 to turn the company around. Hackett first joined Ford’s board of directors in 2013. On March 10, 2016, he was named chairman of Ford Smart Mobility, a wholly owned subsidiary tasked with accelerating “the company’s plans to design, build, grow and invest in emerging mobility services”. Prior to this, Hackett spent 33 years at Steelcase, rising from various low-level sales and marketing positions to become its CEO by the end of 1994, with the company swimming in red ink. He retired from the CEO’s chair in 2014, and left the company entirely in 2015. According to a profile piece in M Live, Hackett helped to modernise the furniture maker, and return it to profitability and growth. To do this, Hackett radically downsized the company, shuttering half of its factories and shedding around 12,000 jobs. Among the people he had to personally let go was the best man at his own wedding. Above: Mark Fields, during happier times. Mark Fields Fields took the reins as Ford’s CEO on July 1, 2014, after serving as chief operating officer under Alan Mulally for around two years. He began his career at Ford in 1989, and rose to become managing director of the company’s operations in Argentina. In 1998, he was transferred over to Mazda, which at the time was controlled by Ford. Starting out as their marketing director and then later president, he helped to turn Mazda around after it found itself battered first by the bursting of the bubble economy and then the Asian financial crisis of the late 1990s, as well as the Japanese automaker’s earlier overly ambitious plans to take on Toyota with a diverse selection of new brands and models. After his stint in Asia, he took on roles in Europe, including heading up the Ford brand and the company’s Premier Automotive Group, which, at one stage, included Volvo, Aston Martin, Land Rover and Jaguar. In 2005, he returned to his native USA, where he helped to turn around the company’s loss-making North American arm. In an official statement released today by Ford Motor Company, Bill Ford was quoted as saying: “Mark Fields has been an outstanding leader and deserves a lot of credit for all he has accomplished in his many roles around the globe at Ford. “His strong leadership was critical to our North American restructuring, our turnaround at the end of the last decade, and our record profits in the past two years.” Board changes In addition to Fields’ departure, and Hackett’s rise to CEO, Ford has also confirmed details of a boardroom reshuffle, effective from June 1. In addition to his existing role as head of Ford Europe, Middle East and Africa, Jim Farley will soon take the reins of the Americas and Asia Pacific divisions, global marketing sales and services, and Lincoln. He will also oversee the company’s strategy for electric and autonomous vehicles. Joe Hinrichs will relinquish his role as head of the company’s Americas arm. Instead he will now lead the company’s global product development, manufacturing, quality assurance, purchasing, safety and sustainability teams. Hackett’s old role as head of Smart Mobility will be assumed by Marcy Klevorn, who retains her position as chief information officer. Reporting to Klevorn will be Paul Ballew, the company’s new head of data and analytics. Mark Truby will take over from Ray Day as the company’s head of communications. Until today, Truby was the head of Ford’s communications teams for Asia Pacific, and Europe, Middle East and Africa.

Caroline Valetkevitch NEW YORK — Reuters Published Monday, May 22, 2017 4:42PM EDT Last updated Monday, May 22, 2017 4:44PM EDT Comments Share via email Share on facebook Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Print U.S. stocks rose on Monday, boosted by technology shares and by defense companies, which gained after the United States and Saudi Arabia signed a multi-billion dollar arms deal. Shares of General Dynamics, Raytheon, and Lockheed Martin all hit record highs early on but ended off those levels, with gains of between 0.6 per cent and 1.6 per cent. Boeing gave the Dow its biggest boost, ending up 1.6 per cent at $183.67. The S&P industrials index rose 0.7 per cent and the S&P 500 posted a third straight day of gains, further recovering from last week’s selloff that was tied to worries about the outlook for U.S. President Donald Trump’s domestic agenda. Trump visited Saudi Arabia over the weekend and sealed $110-billion in deals. Riyadh will buy U.S. arms to help it counter Iran, with options running as high as $350-billion over 10 years. It was his first foreign trip since taking office and one the White House hopes will shift the focus away from domestic controversies such as his firing of the former Federal Bureau of Investigation chief and investigations into his administration’s possible links to Russia. “For investors that were concerned about that, this successful trip he’s had has kind of put those concerns on the back-burner,” said Bucky Hellwig, senior vice president at BB&T Wealth Management in Birmingham, Alabama. “There’s still a lot of money on the sidelines. When the market goes down, many investors view it as an opportunity to buy the dip.” While every sector but energy ended higher on the day, tech shares were the day’s best performers, with Amazon, Microsoft and Apple among the biggest drivers in the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 89.99 points, or 0.43 per cent, to 20,894.83, the S&P 500 gained 12.29 points, or 0.52 per cent, to 2,394.02 and the Nasdaq Composite added 49.92 points, or 0.82 per cent, to 6,133.62. Volatility eased as stocks continued their recovery from last week. The CBOE Volatility Index, the most widely followed barometer of expected near-term stock market volatility, has given up nearly all its gains from last week. It fell more than a point on Monday to end at 10.93. A much stronger-than-expected earnings season has also helped investor sentiment. With results in from nearly all of the S&P 500 names, year-over-year first-quarter growth is now estimated at 15.3 per cent, Thomson Reuters data showed. “There’s fundamental support underlying the market from that,” Hellwig said. Ford was up 2.1 per cent at $11.10 after the automaker named James Hackett as chief executive, responding to investors’ growing unease about its stock price and prospects. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 2.17-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.95-to-1 ratio favored advancers. The S&P 500 posted 45 new 52-week highs and 3 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 102 new highs and 60 new lows. About 5.9 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, below the 6.9 billion daily average for the past 20 trading days, according to Thomson Reuters data.

(Courtesy of the Onion) By The Washington Post By Abby Ohlheiser The fast pace of events under President Donald Trump has some good news and some bad news for the Onion and the rest of the internet's satirists. The good news is, there's a lot of material to work with. The bad? There's so much material, churning through the news cycle at such a speedy pace, that it becomes tough to interject with a joke. "We had a ton of great articles about various parts of the campaign, Trump's personality, and the people around him," Onion Editor in Chief Cole Bolton said in an interview with The Washington Post on Friday. "But we felt like each one of those is a drop in the bucket." So, the Onion is trying something new: Why not flood the internet with a ton of jokes about the Trump administration, all at once? The Trump Documents, released by the Onion on Monday, are the satirical newspaper's fictional version of the Pentagon Papers. It's about 700 pages of fake executive order drafts, emails and classified "documents" that, collectively, are the Onion's first big swing at capturing this particular political moment. Bolton calls it a mix of "really hard satire" about the administration, its people and its goals, along with some more traditional Onion-y silliness. It's all supposed to have the feel of a major leak of classified documents. The Trump Documents, in a way, are an attempt at finding a way to produce effective work - in the Onion's case, satire - in a world where expectations have changed. It's not that Trump is hard to satirize. It's that there's too much to satirize. "We just couldn't keep up all the time," Bolton said. "There was just so much to ridicule that it got to be such a drag. I'm sure it's the same way with regular journalism, just following him all the time would be just tiring." The Onion is hoping that by flooding the internet, it will be able to get readers to pause for a moment and take it all in. It is also planning about two weeks of "coverage" of its project - everything from editorials to a Facebook Live rollout, to tweets featuring individual documents from the massive trove. The coverage will mimic the seriousness of a real newspaper covering a major government leak. BREAKING: 'The Onion' Has Obtained Hundreds Of Classified Documents From The Trump White House https://t.co/2nEnXw9RmS #TrumpDocuments pic.twitter.com/0wdwOvtnvo -- The Onion (@TheOnion) May 22, 2017 In one document, Trump is arguing with Boeing's chief executive about the decor for Air Force One. "Whole interior should be marble," Trump writes in a (fake) email. "Not just floor." He wants marble walls, marble doors, marble bathroom fixtures, marble seats, with headrests that are adjustable and marble. The chief executive replies that "it's just not possible to use marble for every element of the plane's interior." Trump persists, he emails back a drawing where every part of the plane is labeled "marble." There also are fictional memos to Trump from Vice President Mike Pence, which read as if they were written by Cotton Mather. One lists "heretics" in Congress and their suspected crimes (Sen. Elizabeth Warren, for instance, is "head witch"), while another warns the president of a "potential violation" of the first commandment in the Bible. The Onion also took a stab at imagining one of Trump's presidential briefings. It looks like one of those paper placemats that children doodle on in family restaurants. The hope, he added, is that the internet will embrace the project as an injection of "humorous catharsis during a very unusual political time," one that rises above the incremental absurdities of the internet's response to these past few months. There's another possibility, too: What if people actually believe the Onion documents are real? One of the strange things about satire on the internet recently has been how believable it is. For instance, a Twitter humorist photoshopped the ending of a New York Times story recently to make it appear as if Speaker of the House Paul D. Ryan drove away from the White House blaring Papa Roach's "Last Resort." The humorist had to later clarify that his tweet was just a joke, after a ton of people believed it was a real thing that happened in 2017. And before Trump's election, there were hoaxes involving faked emails from the Democratic National Committee, including one that tricked viewers into thinking a Hillary Clinton aide had referred to America's military as a bunch of "idiot soldiers." The Trump Documents, too, look believable, even if the content within them is clearly absurd. Bolton said that his staff spent time tracking down the exact letterheads and fonts to make each document look as authentic as possible. Some pages involve hand-drawn doodles. The rest were printed out after creation and manually re-scanned back into a digital form, to make each image look more like it was really leaked. "It is on our mind," Bolton said of the possibility that these documents might trick someone into thinking they're real. But the Onion's style has always closely mimicked the news it parodies, and the Trump Documents are no different. "I think the reason that the satire sings is because it mimics, say, The Washington Post so closely. We use really dry AP style writing in our headlines," he said. "We never wink, we never break character." It seems inevitable that someone is going to think something in this massive trove of 700 very authentic looking documents is the real deal, particularly if individual pages are removed from their original context, as tends to happen on the internet. But Bolton and his team are hoping that the jokes manage to make themselves clear for what they are. "I hope the satirical stuff resonates with people," Bolton said. "I think the highest compliment we ever get on our articles - and hopefully on this - is 'Oh, the Onion nailed it, the Onion captured it perfectly.' We kind of want it to feel like we captured a moment in the zeitgeist." This piece first appeared in The Washington Post.

Trump's visit is his first foreign trip since taking office and one the White House hopes will shift the focus away from domestic controversies such as his firing of the former FBI head last week and investigations into his administration's possible links to Russia. Worries about the outlook for Trump's domestic agenda causes a selloff in stocks last week. “We're still recovering from that scare last week. Invariably in this bull market, there's still a lot of money on the sidelines.

While the strong earnings season and positive economic data will help provide support, the market will continue to be susceptible to political developments and what they mean for Trump's agenda of tax cuts and higher infrastructure spending.

"My old football coach used to say you either get better or you get worse. You don't stay the same." That's the perceived problem with Ford right now. It's staying the same as a range of competitors from General Motors to Tesla take risks to try to get better. Couple that with a spongy stock price that never seems to gain traction, and it's a little clearer why Ford's veteran CEO Mark Fields is out of a job. Here's several observations about the stunning turn of events. – Executive chairman Bill Ford Jr. is looking for his next Alan Mulally, who led the company though one of its darkest periods and set a culture of winning with his One Ford mantra. "I promised myself I wouldn't compare Jim to Alan this morning ... Alan really captured the hearts and minds of our employees," Bill Ford said. – In some ways, that was tough for Fields, a lifelong Ford executive, to live up to. Mulally transcended the car business. Some thought he looked like Robert Redford. As a former Boeing executive he had no deeply rooted beliefs about cars and was willing to challenge long-held practices. Hackett, who comes from the furniture industry, has a similar approach. – Optics matter. Analysts, the stockmarket, shareholders, even customers all wondered: What's next? Where is the company's Tesla-fighter? Chevy already has one, the Bolt, and it's on sale. What's happening with autonomous cars? Ford is working on one, but hardly anyone knows that. That could be why the company's top PR man Ray Day is retiring and will be replaced by former newspaper editor and current Ford communications executive Mark Truby. Fields was articulate and answered questions in a forthright matter, but he didn't explain Ford's high level goals like Mulally did. – With that backdrop, the numbers needed to be good, and they weren't. Sales have slipped 5.1 percent this year. Profits dropped in the first quarter, and the full-year results are expected to be down slightly, Reuters reports. – Hackett's diverse background clearly intrigued Bill Ford. He led furniture maker Steelcase for 20 years and oversaw its evolving business model as offices shifted away from closed settings to open areas – a dramatic change in that sector. Ford also liked his leadership at Steelcase during the recession, which he argued hit that industry even harder than the auto business. Think about it. Even in hard times, some people still buy cars. Office furniture? Not so much. – Hackett also was the interim athletic director at Michigan for about a year and a half, a seemingly unrelated job, but Bill Ford noted that "shows his loyalty" and that he could manage a "very difficult and public situation." U-M's football team was mired in losing, and Hackett was able to persuade star NFL coach Jim Harbaugh to return to Michigan, where he played in the 1980s. Hackett also secured one of college football's richest equipment and apparel deals with Nike for U-M. – Other executives, including Jim Farley and Joe Hinrichs, are getting more responsibility and are seemingly empowered. They will "work closely" with Hackett to "lead Ford's day-to-day operations," Bill Ford said. That's an interesting move, perhaps one that wouldn't have been possible with the status quo. – Finally, this change likely wouldn't have happened at any other point in automotive history. The sector is changing so much, standing still, or the perception of that, can be killer. Expect Hackett to make changes and more clearly articulate them than Fields did.

Evaluating Aerospace Manufacturing Hubs Kawasaki Motors Manufacturing Corp., U.S.A opened the company's new Aerospace Division in Lincoln, Nebraska. Mike Boyle, Vice President and Plant Manager in Lincoln, said Kawasaki invested about $12.6 million in the new production line, and the work will eventually lead to about 50 new positions at the plant, which currently employs about 2,000. According to the Lincoln Partnership for Economic Development, Kawasaki has created land and sea products in Lincoln since 1974. Now, the company will expand into air travel. Production will initially focus on cargo door manufacturing for Boeing Corporation 777x aircraft. This is the first aerostructures production line for Kawasaki in the United States. Kawasaki officials said they look forward to being a strong and trusted partner on the 777x project and hope to continue to develop the relationship on future projects. Taking this opportunity to establish an assembly line for the Boeing 777x's cargo doors, Kawasaki designates the Lincoln factory as its aerostructure manufacturing base in the U.S. and will actively pursue the expansion of its commercial aircraft business as well as the growth of KMM. Lincoln Chamber of Commerce and Partnership for Economic Development president Wendy Birdsall said, "We are excited that Kawasaki has created this new division in Lincoln. Kawasaki has been not only a great corporate innovator, but also a long-time Partnership investor and employer providing quality jobs for the city of Lincoln."

Photos Videos Topics Live Cricket Score Home India Mumbai Delhi World Business Technology Sports IPL Entertainment Bollywood Hollywood Television Lifestyle Education & Careers TRENDING# Kulbhushan Jadhav Kapil Mishra Narendra Modi Exam results 2017 Donald Trump News Business News US STOCKS-Wall St ends up; defense, tech stocks a boost Shares0 Tue, 23 May 2017-02:10am , Reuters U.S. stocks rose on Monday, boosted by technology shares and by defense companies, which gained after the United States and Saudi Arabia signed a multi-billion dollar arms deal. Shares of General Dynamics, Raytheon, and Lockheed Martin all hit record highs early on but ended off those levels, with gains of between 0.6 percent and 1.6 percent. Boeing gave the Dow its biggest boost, ending up 1.6 percent at $183.67. The S&P industrials index rose 0.7 percent and the S&P 500 posted a third straight day of gains, further recovering from last week's selloff that was tied to worries about the outlook for U.S. President Donald Trump's domestic agenda. Trump visited Saudi Arabia over the weekend and sealed $110 billion in deals. Riyadh will buy U.S. arms to help it counter Iran, with options running as high as $350 billion over 10 years. It was his first foreign trip since taking office and one the White House hopes will shift the focus away from domestic controversies such as his firing of the former Federal Bureau of Investigation chief and investigations into his administration's possible links to Russia. "For investors that were concerned about that, this successful trip he's had has kind of put those concerns on the back-burner," said Bucky Hellwig, senior vice president at BB&T Wealth Management in Birmingham, Alabama. "There's still a lot of money on the sidelines. When the market goes down, many investors view it as an opportunity to buy the dip." While every sector but energy ended higher on the day, tech shares were the day's best performers, with Amazon, Microsoft and Apple among the biggest drivers in the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 89.99 points, or 0.43 percent, to 20,894.83, the S&P 500 gained 12.29 points, or 0.52 percent, to 2,394.02 and the Nasdaq Composite added 49.92 points, or 0.82 percent, to 6,133.62. Volatility eased as stocks continued their recovery from last week. The CBOE Volatility Index, the most widely followed barometer of expected near-term stock market volatility, has given up nearly all its gains from last week. It fell more than a point on Monday to end at 10.93. A much stronger-than-expected earnings season has also helped investor sentiment. With results in from nearly all of the S&P 500 names, year-over-year first-quarter growth is now estimated at 15.3 percent, Thomson Reuters data showed. "There's fundamental support underlying the market from that," Hellwig said. Ford was up 2.1 percent at $11.10 after the automaker named James Hackett as chief executive, responding to investors' growing unease about its stock price and prospects. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 2.17-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.95-to-1 ratio favored advancers. The S&P 500 posted 45 new 52-week highs and 3 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 102 new highs and 60 new lows. About 5.9 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, below the 6.9 billion daily average for the past 20 trading days, according to Thomson Reuters data.

REUTERS/Pawel Kopczynski 2/2 By Andrew Chung | WASHINGTON WASHINGTON The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday tightened rules for where patent lawsuits can be filed in a decision that may make it harder for so-called patent "trolls" to launch sometimes dodgy patent cases in friendly courts, a major irritant for high-tech giants like Apple and Alphabet Inc's Google. In a decision that upends 27 years of law governing patent infringement cases, the justices sided with beverage flavoring company TC Heartland LLC in its legal battle with food and beverage company Kraft Heinz Co (KHC.O). The justices ruled 8-0 that patent suits can be filed only in courts located in the jurisdiction where the targeted company is incorporated. MORE BUSINESS NEWS FROM REUTERS: In Bombardier fight, Boeing sees ghost of Airbus ascent China slaps import duties on sugar; experts question impact The decision overturned a 2016 ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, a Washington-based patent court, that said patent suits are fair game anywhere a defendant company's products are sold. Individuals and companies that generate revenue by suing over patents instead of actually making products have been dubbed "patent trolls." The ruling is likely to lessen the steady flow of patent litigation filed in a single federal court district in rural East Texas because of its reputation for having rules and juries that favor plaintiffs bringing infringement suits. Heartland said the ruling will limit the ability to "shop" for friendly courts. "Individuals and businesses in the U.S. have been unfairly required for decades to defend patent suits in far off locales adding cost, complexity and unpredictably to the intellectual property marketplace," company Chief Executive Ted Gelov said. Kraft Senior Vice President Michael Mullen said the company was disappointed in the ruling but did not believe it would affect the outcome of its lawsuit. The dispute began when Kraft filed a patent suit involving liquid water flavorings in Delaware federal court against Heartland, a subsidiary of Heartland Consumer Products Holdings. Heartland sought to transfer the case to its home base in Indiana, arguing it has no presence in Delaware and 98 percent of its sales are outside of that state. The appeals court denied the transfer last year. Even though the lawsuit was not filed in Texas, the arguments in the case touched on the peculiar fact that the bulk of patent litigation in the United States flows to the Eastern District of Texas, far from the centers of technology and innovation in the United States. More than 40 percent of all patent lawsuits are filed in East Texas. Of those, 90 percent are brought by "patent trolls," according to a study published in a Stanford Law School journal.   CONGRESSIONAL EFFORTS High-tech firms in particular have been vocal about the need for legislation to curb patent suits, including by limiting where they are filed. Recent efforts in Congress have failed. Over the years, companies such as Apple, Google, Samsung Electronics Co Ltd and Microsoft Corp have been frequent targets of patent lawsuits, including in East Texas. Limiting patent lawsuits to where a defendant company is incorporated would potentially make it harder to extract lucrative settlements from businesses being sued, and easier to get cases dismissed. Such changes could potentially dissuade some cases from being launched in the first place, said Illinois Institute of Technology Chicago-Kent College of Law professor Greg Reilly, who has studied the issue of patent venue. "This is a positive step for those who think there is a problem of a lot of poor-quality patents being enforced," Reilly said. A 1990 ruling by the Federal Circuit loosened the geographic limits on patent cases and has served as a blueprint for such cases ever since. The Federal Circuit denied Heartland's transfer by relying on the 1990 ruling. Heartland urged the Supreme Court to overturn that decision, arguing that the high court's own precedent from 1957 held that patent suits are governed by a specific law allowing suits only where defendants are incorporated. On Monday, the Supreme Court agreed. Writing the opinion for the court, Justice Clarence Thomas said that, contrary to the Federal Circuit's rationale, the U.S. Congress did not change the rules over where patent suits may be filed since the 1957 decision. Justice Neil Gorsuch joined the court after it heard arguments in the case and did not participate in the decision.     (Reporting by Andrew Chung; Editing by Will Dunham) Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles Next In Innovation and Intellectual Property EU to conclude Google antitrust cases in next few months OXFORD, England EU antitrust regulators will rule in the "next few months" whether Alphabet's Google abused its dominance of internet searches and other areas, a senior European Commission official said on Monday, an outcome that could lead to a hefty fine.

But the far bigger long-term growth potential and competitive opportunity for turning around America’s trade woes lies with exported services, from financial consulting and insurance to engineering and digital music. Unlike trade in goods, in which the U.S. ran a deficit of $750 billion last year, the country posted a $250 billion surplus in services the same year. With a handful of exceptions, the U.S. enjoys a surplus in service exports with nearly every other country it trades with. In the case of a few nations, exports of services turned American trade deficits into surpluses. For example, Trump recently complained about Canada’s $15-billion advantage in trade of goods with the U.S., but when services are counted, it is the U.S. that has an overall $8-billion surplus. “The real action in the future is trade of services; it’s large and growing rapidly,” said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics. He and others see the lack of attention given to U.S. service exports as a lost opportunity. Exports account for just 4 percent of the sales of U.S. services that are tradable, compared with about 20 percent of American manufactured goods, said J. Bradford Jensen, a professor at Georgetown University’s McDonough School of Business and a leading expert on services trade. And while 1 out of 4 U.S. manufacturers export, only 5 percent of businesses that provide exportable services do so. “I don’t think anyone disputes that the United States has globally competitive service firms — finance, insurance, the internet, Hollywood, music, architects, engineers, R&D scientists — all that stuff, we’re as good as they come,” Jensen said. “And yet we’re not exporting a lot of that to countries that need them, like China and India.” It’s not unusual for the public, or presidents, to link trade with manufactured goods that are loaded into containers and shipped in ocean waters. Trump has gone further by making trade and manufacturing jobs his top economic priority, though — something that many economists criticize as a misguided fixation. That focus on manufactured goods has led Trump to lash out at trading partners like Mexico, threatening to slap tariffs on imported products and tear up trade pacts such as the North American Free Trade Agreement. But experts say such moves could backfire by sparking a trade war that would inevitably spread to service exports. “If we pick a fight with the rest of the world (on goods), that’s going to short-circuit the trade in services,” Zandi said. Worldwide, growth of trade in services has been outstripping that of goods over the last quarter century. Not all services are tradable; hotels, restaurants and home health care providers can’t export their labor-intensive services. But some of the fastest-growing and most lucrative services can, such as professional and technical work. U.S. exports of services to China, for example, have tripled since the Great Recession in 2009, to more than $53 billion last year. They include sales of Microsoft software, Hollywood movies, maintenance work on Boeing aircraft in China, as well as an array of services related to the Asian country’s infrastructure development and environmental improvements. Also counted as exports of services are royalty revenues and fees collected for patents and licenses. That would include, for example, the potential future earnings for Trump, who recently received provisional approval from Beijing for trademarks of the Trump brand that could end up on hotels, golf courses and other businesses, just as in the U.S. The U.S. currently has a trade surplus with almost every country. India stands out as the biggest exception, thanks to that country’s exports of I.T. services, including revenues from U.S. companies contracting with call centers in India. Experts say American service providers would be selling more abroad were it not for a wide variety of barriers in overseas markets. Many countries are even more protective of their services than manufactured goods, such as banking, telecommunications and sectors that disseminate information. The Obama administration sought to break down some of those barriers in negotiating the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the trade agreement with 11 other nations that span the Pacific Ocean. As a candidate, Trump sharply criticized the agreement as a bad deal for America, and he canceled the pending pact as soon as he took office. Even so, Trump’s trade team is expected to incorporate some of the provisions and language on services reached in the Trans-Pacific Partnership. And this month, the White House announced a trade deal with Beijing in which China agreed to take steps to open access to its financial markets, including for U.S. providers of electronic payment services. Positive as that news was, American services firms said they would not know the actual impact until licenses are approved and banks in China issue foreign brand cards for domestic use, according to the Coalition of Services Industries, a Washington trade group. If barriers to services exports remain, it’s partly because the U.S. has paid relatively little attention to the problem. “The U.S. has a comparative advantage in services, but in a sense it’s not doing as much to exploit this advantage,” said Andrea Ariu, a postdoctoral fellow at the Geneva School of Economics and Management who has researched services trade in the world. All the short-term attention on trade and manufacturing jobs will not help America’s economic competitiveness down the road, he said, noting that other countries are investing more in developing exportable services like scientific research, to win contracts, for example, for specialized measurements or lab analyses of materials. “Ten to 15 years from now, I’m pretty sure China will develop the services sector a lot. They might become as good as the U.K. and the U.S. one day,” Ariu said. To some analysts, the Trump administration’s rationale for focusing on manufacturing and trade rests partly on nostalgia and outdated economic statistics. Trump has talked of returning America to its glory days when it was an industrial powerhouse, but manufacturing today accounts for 8.5 percent of total U.S. employment, down from 25 percent in the 1970s. Industrial output now represents only 12 percent of the nation’s gross domestic product. Trump administration officials wistfully point to Germany, which has a large trade surplus with the U.S. and the rest of the world, and where manufacturing still makes up 20 percent of employment. But what’s not often noted is that Germany’s factory payrolls too have shrunk, by about half since 1970 as a share of overall employment, as manufacturing has become much more automated and globalized. Peter Navarro, a trade and manufacturing policy adviser to Trump, argues that manufacturing is what matters in trade because it pays significantly higher wages than services and has a much bigger ripple effect on the rest of the economy. But that thinking, too, looks outmoded. With the decline of unions, outsourcing and global competitive pressures, average manufacturing wages in the U.S. have fallen behind those of the services sector at large. Excluding supervisors, the hourly pay of U.S. manufacturing workers has increased at an average annual rate of 1.9 percent over the last decade, compared with 2.9 percent for the service-producing economy, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The result is that factory workers today make on average $20.43 an hour, 90 cents less than service workers. It was the other way around in 2005. The gap in pay is even bigger when comparing the average production worker with those in business and professional services, whose earnings are more than 20 percent higher. What’s more, experts say trade in services is not only growing at a faster rate but is much larger than government statistics indicate. While traded products are measured as they pass through customs, services are harder to track and sometimes hidden in the value of manufactured goods. “What you would not see reported anywhere necessarily is the amount of services and labor that went into production and servicing of exports,” said Christine Bliss, president of the Coalition of Services Industries. In Rochester, Mich., Rob Patterson and Kevin Zalewski export personalized, customized-bound books. The company is called LoveBook, inspired by the handmade notebook filled with sweet inscriptions that Patterson first gave to his wife as a gift. Seven years on, LoveBook now has 16 employees and more than $10 million in sales, and about 40 percent of that is exports. But most of what it sells abroad are not manufactured goods — they’re digital books sold to Britain, Australia and dozens of other countries. The digital versions are sent to local printing shops, which then produce the books and ship them to customers. LoveBook doesn’t face traditional barriers like tariffs. What keeps its business from growing faster is better transportation services and greater ability to market, especially in developing countries where U.S.-based social media and other information technology services are met with obstacles. Facebook is banned in China, for example, and it’s common for governments to restrict the free flow and storage of data across borders. “It seems people are used to developing policy based on old-fashioned goods,” said Patterson, 43, himself a former employee of an old-line consumer products manufacturer. “The top companies 20 to 30 years ago were auto companies and appliance and other manufacturers of goods,” he said. “But you’re seeing this shift to companies that deal in data rather than in tangible products. That’s the way a lot of the market is going.” Published: May 22, 2017 — 3:01 AM EDT | Updated: May 22, 2017 — 4:05 PM EDT Thanks for your continued support...

Boeing (BA.N) was up 1.3 percent and the second-biggest boost to the Dow. U.S. President Donald Trump visited Saudi Arabia over the weekend and sealed $110 billion in deals through which Riyadh will buy U.S. arms to help it counter Iran, with options running as high as $350 billion over 10 years.Trump's visit is his first foreign trip since taking office and one the White House hopes will shift the focus away from domestic controversies such as his firing of the former FBI head last week and investigations into his administration's possible links to Russia. Worries about the outlook for Trump's domestic agenda causes a selloff in stocks last week."We're still recovering from that scare last week. Invariably in this bull market, there's still a lot of money on the sidelines.

(Reuters) US stocks rose on Monday, boosted by technology shares and by defense companies, which rose after the United States and Saudi Arabia signed a multi-billion dollar arms deal. Shares of defense firms General Dynamics, Raytheon , and Lockheed Martin all hit record highs before easing to trade up between 0.4 percent and 1.6 percent. Boeing was up 1.3 percent and the second-biggest boost to the Dow. US President Donald Trump visited Saudi Arabia over the weekend and sealed $110 billion in deals through which Riyadh will buy U.S. arms to help it counter Iran, with options running as high as $350 billion over 10 years. Trump’s visit is his first foreign trip since taking office and one the White House hopes will shift the focus away from domestic controversies such as his firing of the former FBI head last week and investigations into his administration’s possible links to Russia. Worries about the outlook for Trump’s domestic agenda causes a selloff in stocks last week. You May Also Want To Watch: “We’re still recovering from that scare last week.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: Southwest Airlines Gets Serious About Hawaii Flights to Hawaii are starting to move towards the top of Southwest Airlines' list of future growth opportunities. Adam Levine-Weinberg (TMFGemHunter) May 22, 2017 at 1:45PM For years, Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) has been talking about Hawaii as a future market for growth. However, it has never been the carrier's top priority. In recent years, there have always been more compelling or time-sensitive opportunities to soak up Southwest's capacity growth. That's starting to change. At Southwest Airlines' annual meeting last week, CEO Gary Kelly indicated that entering the Hawaii market is now a "high priority" for the company. Southwest's attention has been elsewhere Ever since it added Boeing's 737-800 to its fleet five years ago, Southwest Airlines has highlighted Hawaii as a potential new destination. Yet the carrier has instead pursued a series of one-off opportunities to grow in capacity-constrained markets since then. Southwest has been interested in flying to Hawaii for several years. Image source: Southwest Airlines. In 2014, as part of the American Airlines-US Airways merger, Southwest acquired slots at LaGuardia Airport in New York and Reagan Airport near Washington, D.C. Putting those slots to use was a key growth priority for 2014. In late 2014, Southwest Airlines' home airport -- Dallas Love Field -- opened up to longer-haul domestic flights, after years of being limited to short-haul routes. This represented an even bigger opportunity, driving the bulk of Southwest's 2015 capacity expansion. For the past two years, international markets have been the key growth driver. Southwest opened an international terminal in Houston in late 2015 and it is scheduled to open a new one in Fort Lauderdale, Florida this summer. These cities are becoming Southwest's two main international gateways, although the carrier operates international flights from some other cities, too. Hawaii comes into focus In contrast to the recent past, Southwest doesn't have any well-defined growth plans for 2018 and beyond. As a result, Hawaii seems to be rapidly moving up management's priority list. Southwest Airlines will start adding the 737 MAX 8 to its fleet later this year. The MAX 8 will have more range and be more fuel efficient than any of the aircraft in Southwest's current fleet, making it an ideal plane for flying to Hawaii. That said, Southwest is in the midst of retiring the last of its older "Classic"-series aircraft. As a result, its fleet size is scheduled to increase just 3% from the beginning of 2017 to the end of 2018. Additionally, there is a lengthy certification process for operating long over-water flights, like the ones from the West Coast to Hawaii. Southwest hasn't even begun that process yet. Both of these factors suggest that Hawaii flights won't launch until 2019 -- or even 2020. Should Hawaiian Airlines be worried? Not surprisingly, shares of Hawaii-focused airline company Hawaiian Holdings (NASDAQ:HA) fell last Wednesday, following Kelly's comments about Southwest Airlines expanding to Hawaii. However, while Southwest's entry into the Hawaii market could cause some short-term disruption, it isn't likely to hurt Hawaiian Airlines' positioning in the long run. Hawaiian Holdings Stock Performance, data by YCharts. Southwest hasn't said yet which bases it might use to fly to Hawaii. However, it's reasonable to expect that it would be interested in Hawaii flights from many of Hawaiian Airlines' 10 destinations in the western U.S.: Los Angeles, San Diego, San Francisco, Oakland, California, San Jose, California, Sacramento, California, Portland, Oregon, Seattle, Las Vegas, and Phoenix. (The latter two would probably be feasible only with the smaller and longer-range 737 MAX 7, though.) In the biggest cities (Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Seattle), Hawaiian already faces lots of competition. It has still managed to generate a consistent revenue premium thanks to its good service and unique focus on providing Hawaiian-style hospitality onboard. Competition is lower on Hawaiian Airlines' routes from cities like Oakland, San Diego, San Jose, and Sacramento -- all of which are prime candidates for Southwest service to Hawaii. That said, by the time Southwest would be ready to launch service to Hawaii, Hawaiian will probably have switched to its new A321neo fleet on these routes. Indeed, the A321neo will be critical to Hawaiian's ability to fend off new competition from Southwest Airlines. It will be roughly comparable to Southwest's 737 MAX 8 fleet in terms of unit costs. The A321neos will also include 16 first class seats and 45 extra-legroom economy seats, boosting their revenue potential. Southwest Airlines is likely to see strong demand for its flights to Hawaii, whenever they take off. It is the No. 1 carrier in many West Coast cities, which means that it is starting with a large base of frequent fliers and can also offer lots of connecting options. Nevertheless, Hawaiian Airlines' unique in-flight experience, its premium seating options, and the low costs of its new A321neo fleet will help it remain strongly profitable on West Coast-Hawaii routes.

U.S. stocks are broadly higher early Monday, May 22, 2017, as the market bounces back from a turbulent week.

Ford is up after it replaced CEO Mark Fields, while chemicals maker Huntsman is rising after it agreed to combine with Swiss competitor Clariant. (AP Photo/Richard Drew, File) Single page Share This Article ARTICLE PHOTO GALLERY (1) New York • Strong gains for technology companies like software and chip makers helped lead U.S. stocks higher Monday. Defense contractors also climbed as the market continued to bounce back from a bout of turbulence last week. Stocks rose for the third day in a row. Technology companies are closing in on all-time highs and continued to rise Monday, led by big names like Cisco Systems and Qualcomm. Aerospace and defense companies rose after President Donald Trump presided over a huge sale of military equipment to Saudi Arabia. Amazon led consumer-focused companies higher. Energy companies lagged even though oil prices continued their recent climb. VIDEOS TOP JOBS Sameer Samana, a strategist for Wells Fargo Investment Institute, said people continue to spend more money on personal electronics while businesses invest in automation and software to boost their productivity. "In a low-growth environment, you've got to squeeze more out of every dollar of investment," Samana said. At the same time, he added, some overseas markets have been stronger than expected this year. The Standard & Poor's 500 index jumped 12.29 points, or 0.5 percent, to 2,394.02. The Dow Jones industrial average added 89.99 points, or 0.4 percent, to 20,894.83. The Nasdaq composite gained 49.91 points, or 0.8 percent, to 6,133.62. The Russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks picked up 9.81 points, or 0.7 percent, to 1,377.14. The technology component of the S&P 500 index has soared 18 percent this year, almost three times as much as the broader S&P 500. On Monday chipmaker Qualcomm gained $1.61, or 2.8 percent, to $59.28 and Cisco Systems, which sells equipment like routers, switches and software, rose 38 cents, or 1.2 percent, to $31.59. Adobe Systems picked up $2.42, or 1.8 percent, to $138.85 and design software maker Autodesk jumped $3.45, or 3.1 percent, to $113.36. Both the S&P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq composite set records early last week before worries about growing political uncertainty in Washington, which could hamper President Trump's agenda of tax cuts and deregulation, knocked those indexes back from their highs. The Russell 2000 of smaller companies, which would benefit more than large ones from Trump's proposals, is down 3 percent from the record it set a month ago. Samana said he thinks stocks will become more volatile in the coming months, but not because of politics. Instead, he thinks stocks will break out of their unusual calm because the Federal Reserve and European Central Bank will pull back on the stabilizing measures they've used since the global financial crisis. "If they both start to lay the groundwork for pulling back on the extraordinary stimulus, that's probably the catalyst for a little bit more volatility," he said. Aerospace and defense companies climbed after President Trump presided over a $110 billion sale of military equipment to Saudi Arabia. The agreement could expand to $350 billion over 10 years. Lockheed Martin climbed $4.24, or 1.6 percent, to $277.03 and Boeing gained $2.91, or 1.6 percent, to $183.67. Amgen and its partner UCB said women who took their experimental osteoporosis drug Evenity were more likely to have serious cardiovascular problems than patients who took Fosamax, an older drug. The companies said that was a new safety concern and they no longer expect the Food and Drug Administration to approve Evenity this year. Amgen lost $3.49, or 2.2 percent, to $153.02. Ford replaced CEO Mark Fields as it struggles to keep the traditional parts of its business running smoothly while it tries to remake itself as a nimble, high-tech automaker. In Fields' three years as CEO, popular cars like the Fusion sedan became dated and Ford lagged competitors in bringing long-range electric cars to market. Ford's new CEO is Jim Hackett, who has led Ford's mobility unit for more than a year. Ford added 23 cents, or 2.1 percent, to $11.10. The stock is down 8.5 percent this year. U.S-based Huntsman and Swiss specialty chemicals maker Clariant are merging to create a company with a market value of $13.8 billion. The company will call itself HuntsmanClariant and Clariant shareholders will own 52 percent of the new company. Huntsman stock slid 56 cents, or 2.1 percent, to $26.15 and Clariant stock rose 3.4 percent in Switzerland. Oil prices continued to rally. Benchmark U.S. crude oil added 40 cents to $50.73 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, rose 26 cents to $53.87 a barrel in London. Wholesale gasoline gained 1 cent to $1.66 a gallon. Heating oil rose 2 cents to $1.60 a gallon. Natural gas climbed 7 cents, or 2.3 percent, to $3.33 per 1,000 cubic feet. » Next page...

Shares of defense firms General Dynamics, Raytheon , and Lockheed Martin all hit record highs before easing to trade up between 0.4 percent and 1.6 percent. Boeing was up 1.3 percent and the second-biggest boost to the Dow. U.S. President Donald Trump visited Saudi Arabia over the weekend and sealed $110 billion in deals through which Riyadh will buy U.S. arms to help it counter Iran, with options running as high as $350 billion over 10 years. Trump's visit is his first foreign trip since taking office and one the White House hopes will shift the focus away from domestic controversies such as his firing of the former FBI head last week and investigations into his administration's possible links to Russia. Worries about the outlook for Trump's domestic agenda causes a selloff in stocks last week. "We're still recovering from that scare last week. Invariably in this bull market, there's still a lot of money on the sidelines. When the market goes down, many investors view it as an opportunity to buy the dip," said Bucky Hellwig, senior vice president at BB&T Wealth Management in Birmingham, Alabama. Tech shares were the day's best performers, with Amazon , Microsoft and Apple the biggest drivers on the S&P and the Nasdaq. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 88.01 points, or 0.42 percent, to 20,892.85, the S&P 500 had gained 11.17 points, or 0.47 percent, to 2,392.9 and the Nasdaq Composite had added 43.77 points, or 0.72 percent, to 6,127.48. While the strong earnings season and positive economic data will help provide support, the market will continue to be susceptible to political developments and what they mean for Trump's agenda of tax cuts and higher infrastructure spending. Ford was up 1.7 percent at $11.05 after the automaker named James Hackett as chief executive, responding to investors' growing unease about its stock price and prospects. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.95-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.58-to-1 ratio favored advancers. The S&P 500 posted 45 new 52-week highs and 1 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 93 new highs and 50 new lows.

Shares of General Dynamics (GD.N), Raytheon (RTN.N), and Lockheed Martin (LMT.N) all hit record highs early on but ended off those levels, with gains of between 0.6 percent and 1.6 percent. Boeing (BA.N) gave the Dow its biggest boost, ending up 1.6 percent at $183.67. The S&P industrials index .SPLRCI rose 0.7 percent and the S&P 500 posted a third straight day of gains, further recovering from last week's selloff that was tied to worries about the outlook for U.S. President Donald Trump's domestic agenda. Trump visited Saudi Arabia over the weekend and sealed $110 billion in deals. Riyadh will buy U.S. arms to help it counter Iran, with options running as high as $350 billion over 10 years. It was his first foreign trip since taking office and one the White House hopes will shift the focus away from domestic controversies such as his firing of the former Federal Bureau of Investigation chief and investigations into his administration's possible links to Russia. "For investors that were concerned about that, this successful trip he's had has kind of put those concerns on the back-burner," said Bucky Hellwig, senior vice president at BB&T Wealth Management in Birmingham, Alabama. "There's still a lot of money on the sidelines. When the market goes down, many investors view it as an opportunity to buy the dip." While every sector but energy ended higher on the day, tech shares were the day's best performers, with Amazon (AMZN.O), Microsoft (MSFT.O) and Apple (AAPL.O) among the biggest drivers in the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq. The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI closed up 89.99 points, or 0.43 percent, to 20,894.83, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 12.29 points, or 0.52 percent, to 2,394.02 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 49.92 points, or 0.82 percent, to 6,133.62. Volatility eased as stocks continued their recovery from last week. The CBOE Volatility Index .VIX, the most widely followed barometer of expected near-term stock market volatility, has given up nearly all its gains from last week. It fell more than a point on Monday to end at 10.93. A much stronger-than-expected earnings season has also helped investor sentiment. With results in from nearly all of the S&P 500 names, year-over-year first-quarter growth is now estimated at 15.3 percent, Thomson Reuters data showed. "There's fundamental support underlying the market from that," Hellwig said. Ford (F.N) was up 2.1 percent at $11.10 after the automaker named James Hackett as chief executive, responding to investors' growing unease about its stock price and prospects. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 2.17-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.95-to-1 ratio favored advancers. The S&P 500 posted 45 new 52-week highs and 3 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 102 new highs and 60 new lows. About 5.9 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, below the 6.9 billion daily average for the past 20 trading days, according to Thomson Reuters data.

(Creative Commons/Wikimedia) WASHINGTON/DEARBORN, Mich.—Ford Motor Co. on Monday named James Hackett as chief executive officer, responding to investors’ unease about the U.S. automaker’s stock price and ability to withstand threats from longtime industry rivals and Silicon Valley. Hackett, 62, who overhauled furniture maker Steelcase Inc and then turned around the ailing University of Michigan football program, for the past year has led the Ford unit developing self-driving cars and related services. As part of a broader shake-up, he replaces Mark Fields, 56, who spent less than three years as CEO. Ford Chairman Bill Ford Jr. said he wanted Hackett to speed up decision-making and attack costs, but did not offer many specifics. “The clock speed at which our competitors are working …requires us to make decisions at a faster pace,” Ford said. Bill Ford and other descendants of company founder Henry Ford effectively control the automaker through a special class of shares, but many investors share his concern that the company is running out of time. Ford shares were up 1.7 percent at $11.06 in afternoon trading. At Friday’s close, they had fallen 37 percent since Fields took over three years ago at the peak of the U.S. auto industry’s recovery. Overall U.S. auto sales are slipping after a long boom. The company’s lag those of larger rival General Motors Co., and Ford’s market capitalization trails electric car maker Tesla Inc’s. GM has moved faster than Ford to slash unprofitable operations, and Tesla has been quicker to deploy new technology. Bill Ford indicated the company would take more aggressive action to cut costs. “We have to modernize the business” and move “decisively to address underperforming areas,” he said. He suggested Ford could reduce inventories of unsold vehicles through better use of market data. Hackett, a former CEO of furniture manufacturer Steelcase Inc and a former Ford director, becomes the latest in a line of non-family CEOs brought in with a mandate to change the management culture at one of the auto industry’s oldest institutions. That task has frustrated many of his predecessors, including Bill Ford, who had been CEO before replacing himself in 2006 with Boeing Co executive Alan Mulally. The decision to replace Fields did not result from a single event, Bill Ford told Reuters. “There is no smoking gun here,” he said. “It’s more the way we are organized, the way Jim is going to streamline the organization.” A former football player at the University of Michigan and its interim athletic director, Hackett was tapped in March 2016 to run Ford Smart Mobility, a unit established to oversee and coordinate forays into autonomous driving, ride sharing and other ventures. In that role, he helped oversee Ford’s acquisition of San Francisco ride-sharing company Chariot and its $1 billion investment in Argo AI, a self-driving startup focused on robotics and artificial intelligence. Hackett was previously CEO of Grand Rapids, Michigan-based Steelcase, where he slashed thousands of jobs, then refocused the company on innovation. Pressure in Detroit The upheaval at Ford underlines pressure on all three Detroit automakers to prove they can avoid losses as the U.S. market begins to slow from last year’s record sales. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV is fighting diesel emissions-cheating allegations from U.S. and California regulators following CEO Sergio Marchionne’s failed bid to find a merger partner. GM CEO Mary Barra is fending off attacks from hedge fund Greenlight Capital, which wants to install new directors and split the company’s stock. In March, GM sold its money-losing Opel division to France’s PSA Group, effectively exiting Europe in a move Barra promised would free cash for share buybacks. The shake-up at Ford may bring scrutiny to its own plans in the region. The company posted a record $1.2 billion profit in Europe last year but warned that the impact of Britain’s vote to leave the European Union would put a dent in 2017 earnings. Jim Farley, Ford of Europe chief since January 2015, will oversee all of the company’s regions, global marketing and sales, as well as its Lincoln Motor Co. Joe Hinrichs, head of the Americas since December 2012, will manage global product development, manufacturing and labor affairs, purchasing, and environmental and safety engineering; Marcy Klevorn, vice president of information technology and chief technical officer since January, will oversee Ford Smart Mobility. The company is also putting government relations and corporate communications under Ford Jr, and Hackett said the great-grandson of Henry Ford would have a higher public profile. The automaker has tangled with U.S. President Donald Trump, who spent more than a year criticizing it on the campaign trail for expanding operations in Mexico. But Trump praised Ford in January for scrapping a planned Mexican car factory and announcing plans to add 700 jobs in Michigan. Fields, who made several trips to the White House this year, said Ford would have made the decision regardless of who was president. Fields, who earned $22.1 million in 2016 and had a 28-year-career at Ford, also faced a clamor for share repurchases at the company’s annual meeting earlier this month. He did not respond to repeated messages seeking comment. Ford said last week it would cut 1,400 staff positions in North America and Asia, a small fraction of the 20,000 job reductions some news outlets had reported were imminent. The company reported a record $10.4 billion in pretax earnings in 2016, but investors were concerned by a weak first quarter and lower profit forecast for 2017, as well as higher costs for investments in “emerging opportunities.” Tesla was valued at $51 billion on Friday, more than Ford’s $43 billion. The contrast shows investors’ faltering confidence that old-line automakers can make the transition to a future where software substitutes for pistons and transportation is sold by the mile or the minute. At the same time, GM is turning up the pressure in the North American truck and sport utility business, the source of 90 percent of Ford’s earnings.

(Reuters) - Ford Motor Co on Monday named James Hackett as chief executive officer, responding to investors' unease about the U.S. automaker's stock price and ability to withstand threats from longtime industry rivals and Silicon Valley.

President Donald Trump visited Saudi Arabia over the weekend and sealed $110 billion in deals through which Riyadh will buy U.S. arms to help it counter Iran, with options running as high as $350 billion over 10 years. Shares of defense firms General Dynamics, Raytheon, and Lockheed Martin all hit record highs before easing to trade up between 0.6 percent and 1.6 percent. Boeing was up 1.5 percent and the biggest boost on the Dow. "The bar for success has been set extremely low for President Trump and it seems that he's been able to meet that over the weekend," said Kim Forrest, senior equity research analyst, Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh. Trump's visit is his first foreign trip since taking office and one the White House hopes will shift the focus away from domestic controversies such as his firing of a former FBI head last week and reports of his administration's links to Russia. "Because we were down last week because of political news, the inverse is true too: that nothing bad happened over the weekend in political news," Forrest said. At 12:36 p.m. ET (1636 GMT) the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 94.7 points, or 0.46 percent, at 20,899.54, the S&P 500 was up 11.55 points, or 0.48 percent, at 2,393.28 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 42.09 points, or 0.69 percent, at 6,125.79. Gains were broad based, with ten of the eleven S&P sectors trading higher, led by the tech sector's 0.83 increase and the industrials index's 0.67 percent rise. Amazon, Microsoft and Apple were the biggest drivers on the S&P and the Nasdaq. While the strong earnings season and positive economic data will help provide support, the market will continue to be susceptible to political developments and what they mean for Trump's agenda of tax cuts and higher infrastructure spending. "Investors are growing skeptical," Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at BMO Private Bank in Chicago, said in a note. "The likelihood of President Trump's pro-growth agenda getting signed into law is fading as the Administration and Congress fends off and sorts out the constant barrage of headlines." Also bolstering the market was a 0.8 percent gain in oil prices on rising confidence that top exporters will this week agree to extend supply curbs, or even deepen cuts. Ford was up 1.7 percent at $11.05 after the automaker named James Hackett, who heads its unit developing self-driving cars, as chief executive, responding to investors' growing unease about its stock price and prospects. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,928 to 892. On the Nasdaq, 1,740 issues rose and 987 fell.

(Reuters/Brendan McDermid) NEW YORK (AP) - U.S. stocks are higher Monday as software and chip makers and other technology companies climb. Defense contractors are also rising as the market bounces back from a turbulent week. Ford is up after it replaced CEO Mark Fields. KEEPING SCORE: The Standard & Poor’s 500 index jumped 11 points, or 0.5 percent, to 2,392 as of 12:40 p.m. Eastern time. The Dow Jones industrial average added 88 points, or 0.4 percent, to 20,892. The Nasdaq composite gained 41 points, or 0.7 percent, to 6,124. The Russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks picked up seven points, or 0.5 percent, to 1,374. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq both set records early last week before worries about growing political uncertainty in Washington and its potential effects on President Trump’s agenda of tax cuts and deregulation knocked those indexes back from their highs. The S&P 500 is about 1 percent below its highest close, but the Russell 2000, which contains companies that might get bigger benefits from Mr. Trump’s proposals, is down more than 3 percent from the record it set one month ago. AEROSPACE GAINS ALTITUDE: Aerospace and defense companies climbed after President Trump presided over a $110 billion sale of military equipment to Saudi Arabia. The agreement could expand to $350 billion over 10 years. It appeared to reverse an Obama administration to pause sales of precision-guided munitions to the kingdom. Lockheed Martin climbed $4.30, or 1.6 percent, to $277.09 and Boeing increased $2.81, or 1.6 percent, to $183.57. General Dynamics rose $1.98, or 1 percent, to $197.85. SAVE TO THE CLOUD: Technology companies did better than the rest of the market, as they’ve done throughout this year. Qualcomm, the world’s largest chipmaker, increased $1.34, or 2.3 percent, to $59.02 and Cisco Systems, which sells equipment like routers, switches and software, rose 55 cents, or 1.8 percent, to $31.76. Adobe Systems moved up $2.54, or 1.9 percent, to $138.97 and design software maker Autodesk jumped $3.01, or 2.7 percent, to $112.92. DRIVEN OFF: Ford replaced CEO Mark Fields as the automaker struggles to keep the traditional parts of its business running smoothly while it remakes itself as a nimble, high-tech provider of new mobility services. Fields was CEO for three years, but under his leadership popular cars like the Fusion sedan became dated and Ford lagged competitors in bringing long-range electric cars to market. New CEO is Jim Hackett, who has led Ford’s mobility unit for more than a year. Ford rose 18 cents, or 1.7 percent, to $11.05. The stock is down 9 percent this year. CHEMISTRY: Swiss specialty chemicals maker Clariant and Huntsman Corp. are merging to create a company with a market value of $13.8 billion. The company will call itself HuntsmanClariant and Clariant shareholders will own 52 percent of the new company. Huntsman stock slid 42 cents, or 1.6 percent, to $26.29 and Clariant stock rose 3.4 percent in Switzerland. METAL TESTED: Arconic jumped after the aluminum products company ended a contentious proxy dispute with activist investor Elliott Management. Elliott will get more input as Arconic picks its next CEO, and it will nominate three directors to the company’s board. Arconic agreed to nominate two others, and a third board member resigned and was replaced by a candidate Arconic chose. A month ago, Klaus Kleinfeld was ousted as Arconic’s chairman and CEO after he sent a threatening letter to Paul Singer, Elliott’s founder and Arconic’s largest shareholder. Arconic stock increased 19 cents to $27.77. ENERGY: Oil prices continued to rally and benchmark U.S. crude oil rose 43 cents to $50.76 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, rose 31 cents to $53.92 a barrel in London. However energy companies traded lower. Halliburton fell 57 cents, or 1.2 percent, to $47.21 and Pioneer Natural Resources slid $2.48, or 1.4 percent, to $174.14. BONDS: Bond prices moved a bit lower. The yield on the ten-year Treasury note inched up to 2.25 percent from 2.24 percent. CURRENCIES: The dollar dipped to 111.17 yen from 111.20 yen late Friday. The euro rose to $1.1234 from $1.1205. OVERSEAS: In Britain, the FTSE 100 gained 0.3 percent. The German DAX dipped 0.2 percent and France’s CAC lost a fraction of a percentage point. Japan’s market rose following strong trade data. The benchmark Nikkei 225 gained 0.5 percent while the South Korean Kospi jumped 0.7 percent. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng surged 0.9 percent.

By Associated Press Published: 14:05 EDT, 22 May 2017 | Updated: 15:05 EDT, 22 May 2017 e-mail Ford named Jim Hackett its 10th CEO Monday. The 114-year-old company did not have an official CEO role until it went public in the 1950s. So Henry and Edsel Ford served as presidents of the company but never CEO. A look at the men who preceded Hackett as the top executive of Ford Motor Co. __ FILE - In this July 30, 1942, file photo, Henry Ford visits the shop where he built his first auto, in Detroit. Ford named Jim Hackett its 10th CEO Monday, May 22, 2017. However, Ford did not have an official CEO role until the company went public in the 1950s. So Henry and Edsel Ford served as presidents of Ford, but never CEO. (AP Photo/File) Henry Ford, 1906-1918, 1943-1945 Industrialist Henry Ford founded the Ford Motor company in 1903. A titan of industry, Henry Ford was the first to adapt assembly line techniques to the auto industry with the Model T, and for the first time brought car ownership into the realm of possibilities for middle-class Americans. While Henry Ford passed on the title of president to his son Edsel in 1919, there was little question that the elder Ford remained solidly in control until he officially passed on the title in 1945 to his grandson. __ Edsel Ford, 1919-1943 While he struggled daily for control of the company with his larger-than-life father, Edsel helped move Ford back into market dominance in the late 1920s with the introduction of the Ford Model A. Under Edsel Ford, the company purchased Lincoln Motor Co. which eventually became Ford's higher-end brand to compete with the likes of Buick and Cadillac. Edsel Ford unexpectedly died in 1943, at the height of World War II, forcing the elderly Henry Ford to return to running the company. __ Henry Ford II, 1945-1979 The grandson of the company's founder, Henry Ford II was CEO from 1945 to 1979. He led the company through some of its greatest years but also endured some of its biggest failures. Under Henry Ford II, the company created the popular Thunderbird and Mustang, but also the Edsel marketing flop and the fire-prone Pinto. Ford became a publicly-traded company under Henry Ford II as well. __ Philip Caldwell, 1979-1985 Caldwell was the first CEO of Ford who wasn't a member of the Ford Family. While his successors Donald Petersen and Harold Poling are known for the creation of some of Ford's most iconic brands, Caldwell is best known for being the CEO who started the turnaround effort at Ford during the company's most troubled years. __ Donald Petersen, 1985-1990 Petersen was the first of two consecutive CEOs at Ford who are credited with turning around the company when Ford was struggling against the intense competition from Japanese automakers. Petersen tasked management to create cars that they themselves would be "proud to park in their driveways." The change in corporate culture eventually led to creation of some of Ford's biggest sellers, like the Explorer and Taurus. __ Harold "Red" Poling, 1990-1993 Nicknamed "Red" for his hair, Poling is best known for being a top executive at Ford through two recessions: the early 1980s downturn and the recession in the early 1990s. During the 1980s, Poling along with Petersen pushed Ford to invest money in a new model platform that eventually became known as the Ford Taurus. __ Alexander Trotman, 1993-1999 Born in the U.K., Trotman held numerous positions at Ford before he became its first foreign-born CEO in the early 1990s. Trotman's biggest contribution to the company as CEO was an attempt to move Ford's various brands worldwide to start sharing parts and platforms to help lower production costs. __ Jacques Nasser, 1999-2001 While Nasser became CEO of Ford with the goal of diversifying the automaker and expanding its luxury brands, his three-year tenure was dominated by the Ford-Firestone tire recall and product safety scandal. Ford ended up recalling more than 20 million Firestone tires and the scandal ended the 100-year partnership between Ford and Firestone. __ William Clay Ford Jr., 2001-2006 The great-grandson of Henry Ford, William Clay Ford Jr. focused Ford on larger, heavier vehicles. His attention to large vehicles left Ford unprepared for the sudden change in consumer interests that occurred once gasoline prices spiked and the housing market crashed. He remains Ford's chairman. __ Alan Mulally, 2006-2013 A former executive at Boeing, Mulally became CEO of Ford at a time of crisis for the company and the industry. High gasoline prices were pushing Americans away from SUVs and trucks and into low-profit small vehicles. Mulally cut costs, sold off brands and restructured the company and Ford was the only Detroit automaker not to take government bailout money during the Great Recession. __ Mark Fields, 2014-2017 Fields had the difficult job of replacing Mulally, who achieved hero status. In his three years, Fields began moving Ford from a traditional automaker into a "mobility" company with plans to build autonomous vehicles and explore ride-hailing and car-sharing. Ford posted a record pretax profit of $10.8 billion in 2015. But the stock price fell nearly 40 percent during Fields' tenure.

While Nasser became CEO of Ford with the goal of diversifying the automaker and expanding its luxury brands, his three-year tenure was dominated by the Ford-Firestone tire recall and product safety scandal. Ford ended up recalling more than 20 million Firestone tires and the scandal ended the 100-year partnership between Ford and Firestone.

High gasoline prices were pushing Americans away from SUVs and trucks and into low-profit small vehicles. Mulally cut costs, sold off brands and restructured the company and Ford was the only Detroit automaker not to take government bailout money during the Great Recession.

Ford's new boss Jim Hackett (left) sets out his plans as chairman Bill Ford listens in Credit: Bloomberg Alan Tovey, Industry Editor 22 May 2017 • 6:50pm A look at Ford’s share price graph says it all. Since Mark Fields took the wheel at the American motor giant almost three years ago, the shares have steadily driven downwards, falling almost 40pc from $17 when he started in the top job at the car giant in July 2014, to just under $11 when his departure was announced on Monday. To put that into context, when Ford announced that former Boeing executive Alan Mulally was handing over the driving to Fields after eight years in charge, the company was worth $67bn (£52bn). It’s now worth $43bn (£33bn). With that kind of track record, perhaps the biggest surprise is that his departure has come as a shock to some. Credit: EPA In reality, the signs were there at Ford’s annual meeting a fortnight ago. Questions submitted online by investors referred to the “pathetic, dismal” performance of the company’s shares. It can’t have helped that just weeks before, Elon Musk’s Tesla overtook Ford in company value, despite the billionaire’s electric car business selling just 76,000 vehicles in 2016, compared to Ford’s 6.6 million. Musk even took a side-swipe at Ford - chaired by its founder’s great grandson - when a group of his shareholders complained about Tesla’s board being made up of friends and family. In a tweet, Musk told them to “buy Ford stock. Their governance is amazing…” The annual meeting must have been made even more painful for Fields, with chairman Bill Ford having to read out shareholders’ questions, including one which said the crashing share price indicated a “lack of confidence” in the car-maker’s direction - and therefore Fields’ leadership. Tesla boss Elon Musk has taken a side-swipe at Ford  Credit:  Tony Avelar Comparisons between Ford and Tesla might have made headlines, but are really just an eye-catching aberration. Tesla’s valuation is staggering, and reflects its concept stock status. Ford is a sprawling monolith of a business which was founded more than a century ago, has produced more than 350m vehicles during that time and currently has 200,000 employees. What Tesla and Ford do have in common is a future that is uncertain and rapidly changing. Tesla is convinced the cars of tomorrow will be electric and self-driving, something which Ford - along with most of the other established car companies - had been slow to entertain as likely. Ford CEO Fields: Our Driverless Cars Will Be Affordable 06:10 Ford’s - and Fields’ view - of the coming revolution in the car industry changed very publicly last summer when he laid out plans to build “high volume, fully autonomous” vehicles by 2021. Speaking at that launch, Fields added: “The next decade will be defined by automation of the automobile, and we see autonomous vehicles as having as significant an impact on society as Ford’s moving assembly line did 100 years ago.” Mark Fields announced plans for a self-driving Ford to be available in 2021 Credit: Reuters The company had been quietly working on “smart mobility” - areas such as self-driving cars and new ways of using them, including shared ownership - along with electric vehicles for several years but the launch was seen as Ford putting down a marker that it was fit for the future. However, Monday's events seem to indicate that it came too late for Fields. The previous weeks have seen him confirm huge jobs cuts, with 10pc of North America and Asia Pacific staff being offered redundancy, highlighting how flabby and inefficient the business has become. The latest annual results also revealed that while delivering the second-best pre-tax profit in the company’s history, they were down on the previous year, indicating that its earnings growth has perhaps run out of steam. While rivals such as GM and Fiat Chrysler have forecast rising profitability this year, Ford expects further declines. Ford founder Henry Ford in the workshop where he built his first car Credit: AP Maybe Fields - a relatively youthful 56 - did want to retire after 28 years with Ford. But the chairman’s admission that the pair of them “got together and decided it was the right time to resign” - with replacement Jim Hackett only learning about his new job 72 hours in advance of the announcement - seems to signal that Ford was looking to do something to show it is ready for the future. The future was the focus of Hackett’s first public outing as the chief executive designate on Monday, with the chairman describing him as a “proven transformational leader with a clear vision of the future” who is ready to lead Ford in a time of “unprecedented change”. “The challenge is not moving fast enough,” said Hackett, who added the “future is not fantasy, and we’re really curious about it”. The car industry is facing the biggest revolution since the Model T was built on a moving production line a century ago Credit: Pictorial Press Ltd / Alamy However, asked whether this focus on the future will mean Ford stepping up its previously announced plans to invest $4.5bn in electrification, $1bn in self-driving and to have an autonomous car on the road by 2021, the answer was batted off to finance director Bob Shanks, who replied weakly that “it continues to be part of our plan and remains the basis of the future”. What is certain is that the Ford of the future will be quicker off the starting line, with the chairman saying fast decision making in the face of quickly evolving technology and markets is necessary for survival. Hackett summed it up best when he said the biggest challenge for Ford was making sure the company regains “our right to win in the future”. “We don’t have to cede that to anyone,” he said. “Not even Tesla.” How do driverless cars work? 01:33   Share this article Follow Telegraph Business Follow on Facebook Follow on Twitter Follow on LinkedIn View comments If you would like to add a comment, please register or log in Register Log in Please review our commenting policy Follow Telegraph Business Follow on Facebook Follow on Twitter Follow on LinkedIn Related Topics Tesla Industry Chrysler Manufacturing industry Ford Self driving cars Automotive industry Mark Field Fiat Elon Musk Show more Galleries Gallery 19 May 2017, 11:20pm Gallery: Tiffany's stationery and Samsung's dried fish: how global brands were born Gallery 19 May 2017, 4:22pm Gallery: When activist investors strike: How corporate raiders hit Apple, Microsoft and McDonald's Gallery 17 May 2017, 5:54pm Gallery: Homes with the most gorgeous gardens to rival Chelsea Flower Show Business latest 23 May 2017, 6:00am Comment: Committed investment can bring effective change Pascal Blanque Premium 23 May 2017, 12:01am Britain leads Europe as investment magnet - for now  23 May 2017, 12:01am What TV can I get with Amazon Channels? 23 May 2017, 12:01am Amazon launches UK pay-TV service 22 May 2017, 10:55pm EU ministers fail to reach Greek debt deal, delaying release of fresh bailout cash 22 May 2017, 9:55pm Comment: We cannot be tempted by a Universal Basic Income - it would do huge damage to the economy Matthew Lynn Premium 22 May 2017, 9:12pm Comment: Shareholder activism can be a force for good Lord Gadhia Premium 22 May 2017, 7:36pm Brussels prepares 'grand bargain' to save broken EU project Premium 22 May 2017, 7:12pm RBS edges towards investor settlement after bank makes 11th-hour offer to avert court battle 22 May 2017, 5:41pm Investors protest Johnston Press bonus plans despite abandoned increases 22 May 2017, 5:20pm Watchdog asks if any reason to object to Standard Life-Aberdeen marriage 22 May 2017, 5:05pm Ford replaces Mark Fields with new chief executive Jim Hackett focused on its electric and self-driving future 22 May 2017, 4:42pm Pound falls on Conservatives' poll slide; Greek debt relief decision will be taken in 2018, says Eurogroup head 22 May 2017, 4:38pm AstraZeneca sells rights to heart drug as it eyes up new medicines  22 May 2017, 4:30pm Price of olive oil set to soar as European drought takes its toll 22 May 2017, 4:20pm BSGR attacks 'unlawful' activities of Rio Tinto in Guinea as Simandou hearing opens 22 May 2017, 4:19pm Labour spending spree would boost UK growth but keep debt high, economists say  22 May 2017, 3:32pm Barclays tightens email security to prevent hoaxes after boss fell for fake chairman prankster 22 May 2017, 3:06pm Clariant and Huntsman announce $14bn chemicals merger 22 May 2017, 2:44pm BP gives new hope to North Sea oil revival as extraction begins from one of largest projects in recent years 22 May 2017, 2:39pm Inequality falling as regions beginning to catch up with London when it comes to pay Contact us Rewards Archive Reader Prints Branded Content Syndication Guidelines Privacy Terms and Conditions Leave your feedback © Telegraph Media Group Limited 2017 We've noticed you're adblocking.

Hackett, 62, who overhauled furniture maker Steelcase Inc and then turned around the ailing University of Michigan football program, for the past year has led the Ford unit developing self-driving cars and related services. As part of a broader shake-up, he replaces Mark Fields, 56, who spent less than three years as CEO. Ford Chairman Bill Ford Jr. said he wanted Hackett to speed up decision-making and attack costs, but did not offer many specifics. “The clock speed at which our competitors are working …requires us to make decisions at a faster pace,” Ford said. Bill Ford and other descendants of company founder Henry Ford effectively control the automaker through a special class of shares, but many investors share his concern that the company is running out of time. Ford shares were up 1.7 percent at $11.06 in afternoon trading. At Friday’s close, they had fallen 37 percent since Fields took over three years ago at the peak of the U.S. auto industry’s recovery. Overall U.S. auto sales are slipping after a long boom. The company’s lag those of larger rival General Motors Co, and Ford’s market capitalization trails electric car maker Tesla Inc’s. GM has moved faster than Ford to slash unprofitable operations, and Tesla has been quicker to deploy new technology. Bill Ford indicated the company would take more aggressive action to cut costs. “We have to modernize the business” and move “decisively to address underperforming areas,” he said. He suggested Ford could reduce inventories of unsold vehicles through better use of market data. Hackett, a former CEO of furniture manufacturer Steelcase Inc and a former Ford director, becomes the latest in a line of non-family CEOs brought in with a mandate to change the management culture at one of the auto industry’s oldest institutions. That task has frustrated many of his predecessors, including Bill Ford, who had been CEO before replacing himself in 2006 with Boeing Co executive Alan Mulally. The decision to replace Fields did not result from a single event, Bill Ford told Reuters. “There is no smoking gun here,” he said. “It’s more the way we are organized, the way Jim is going to streamline the organization.” A former football player at the University of Michigan and its interim athletic director, Hackett was tapped in March 2016 to run Ford Smart Mobility, a unit established to oversee and coordinate forays into autonomous driving, ride sharing and other ventures. In that role, he helped oversee Ford’s acquisition of San Francisco ride-sharing company Chariot and its $1 billion investment in Argo AI, a self-driving startup focused on robotics and artificial intelligence. Hackett was previously CEO of Grand Rapids, Michigan-based Steelcase, where he slashed thousands of jobs, then refocused the company on innovation. PRESSURE IN DETROIT The upheaval at Ford underlines pressure on all three Detroit automakers to prove they can avoid losses as the U.S. market begins to slow from last year’s record sales. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV is fighting diesel emissions-cheating allegations from U.S. and California regulators following CEO Sergio Marchionne’s failed bid to find a merger partner. GM CEO Mary Barra is fending off attacks from hedge fund Greenlight Capital, which wants to install new directors and split the company’s stock. In March, GM sold its money-losing Opel division to France’s PSA Group, effectively exiting Europe in a move Barra promised would free cash for share buybacks. The shake-up at Ford may bring scrutiny to its own plans in the region. The company posted a record $1.2 billion profit in Europe last year but warned that the impact of Britain’s vote to leave the European Union would put a dent in 2017 earnings. Jim Farley, Ford of Europe chief since January 2015, will oversee all of the company’s regions, global marketing and sales, as well as its Lincoln Motor Co. Joe Hinrichs, head of the Americas since December 2012, will manage global product development, manufacturing and labor affairs, purchasing, and environmental and safety engineering; Marcy Klevorn, vice president of information technology and chief technical officer since January, will oversee Ford Smart Mobility. The company is also putting government relations and corporate communications under Ford Jr, and Hackett said the great-grandson of Henry Ford would have a higher public profile. The automaker has tangled with U.S. President Donald Trump, who spent more than a year criticizing it on the campaign trail for expanding operations in Mexico. But Trump praised Ford in January for scrapping a planned Mexican car factory and announcing plans to add 700 jobs in Michigan. Fields, who made several trips to the White House this year, said Ford would have made the decision regardless of who was president. Fields, who earned $22.1 million in 2016 and had a 28-year-career at Ford, also faced a clamor for share repurchases at the company’s annual meeting earlier this month. He did not respond to repeated messages seeking comment. Ford said last week it would cut 1,400 staff positions in North America and Asia, a small fraction of the 20,000 job reductions some news outlets had reported were imminent. The company reported a record $10.4 billion in pretax earnings in 2016, but investors were concerned by a weak first quarter and lower profit forecast for 2017, as well as higher costs for investments in “emerging opportunities.” (Reuters) Share Facebook Twitter Google + Stumbleupon LinkedIn Pinterest Tags CEO Ford investors James Hackett motor co unease Previous British citizens in Cyprus to vote by post or proxy Next France’s Macron acts on pledge to clean up politics More Articles Budget pressure likely to keep Saudis propping up oil price May 22, 2017 Sterling retreats below $1.30 on Conservatives’ poll slide May 22, 2017 China’s favoured trade deal in focus at Asian meeting May 22, 2017 Airbus hires outside monitors amid fraud investigations May 22, 2017 Agreement on European transaction levy within reach May 21, 2017 OPEC heads towards supply cut as most on board May 21, 2017 Boeing Co signs defence, commercial deals with Saudi Arabia May 21, 2017 A cause for concern over bull markets May 21, 2017 ExxonMobil, Total discuss offshore drilling opportunities in Greece May 19, 2017 Check Also Greece’s Eurobank stays profitable in first quarter Greece’s Eurobank was profitable for a fifth straight quarter in January-to-March but net earnings dropped … Trump bump to Trump slump: dollar posts worst week in 9 months The dollar was on track to record its worst week since August on Friday, having … Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

Ford is up after it replaced CEO Mark Fields, while chemicals maker Huntsman is rising after it agreed to combine with Swiss competitor Clariant. (AP Photo/Richard Drew, File) TOKYO (AP) — Asian shares were mostly higher in early trading Tuesday after police said they were treating an explosion in Manchester, England, that killed at least 19 people as a terror attack. Oil prices fell back after Monday's rally. KEEPING SCORE: Japan's Nikkei 225 edged 0.2 percent lower to 19,648.09 and the Shanghai Composite Index fell 0.4 percent to 3,062.85. But other markets were mostly higher. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index rose 0.2 percent to 25,431.47 and the S&P ASX 200 of Australia was flat at 5,771.60. South Korea's Kospi gained 0.3 percent to 2,310.02. Markets in Southeast Asia were higher. WALL STREET: Stocks rose for the third straight day with technology companies closing in on all-time highs, led by big names like Cisco Systems and Qualcomm. Aerospace and defense companies rose after President Donald Trump presided over a $110 billion sale of military equipment to Saudi Arabia that could expand to $350 billion over 10 years. The Standard & Poor's 500 index jumped 0.5 percent to 2,394.02. The Dow Jones industrial average 0.4 percent to 20,894.83 and the Nasdaq composite gained 0.8 percent to 6,133.62. MANCHESTER BLAST: The explosion struck an Ariana Grande concert in northern England late Monday, killing at least 19 people and injuring dozens. The singer was not injured. Britain's terrorist threat level has been set at "severe" in recent years, indicating an attack is highly likely. Police said the explosion is being judged a terrorist attack unless new information proves otherwise. ANALYST'S VIEWPOINT: "The recovery in U.S. markets remains underway while the latest development in Manchester threatens to derail the positive lead for markets in the Asia-Pacific region," Jingyi Pan of IG said in a commentary. ENERGY: Benchmark U.S. crude oil lost 10 cents to $51.03 a barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. On Monday it added 46 cents to $51.13 a barrel. Brent crude, used to price international oils, fell 16 cents to $53.71 a barrel. CURRENCIES: The dollar declined to 111.07 yen from 111.34 yen. The euro rose to $1.1252 from $1.1237.

M&A L3 adds undersea drone energy company Open Water Power By Ross Wilkers May 22, 2017 L3 Technologies has made a second acquisition in the underwater drone arena within the past month with the company’s latest purchase of power generation technology company Open Water Power. Open Water Power will join the unmanned undersea vehicle maker now known as L3 OceanServer as part of the New York City-based defense contractor’s sensor systems segment. L3 acquired OceanServer in April to continue a year-long spree of purchases by major defense primes including Boeing and General Dynamics of underwater drone companies. The Navy has allocated $279 million in current fiscal year spend for the procurement and development of underwater drones. Key focus areas include sea mine detection and meteorological testing, according to the Center for the Study of the Drone. Somerville, Mass.-based Open Water Power builds its technologies to use energy stored in aluminum metal to power underwater drones and other maritime platforms. The company designs its energy systems to be activated with water and have a similar safety profile to that of household alkaline batteries. L3 has picked up the pace on deals since the company divested the former National Security Solutions business to CACI International for $550 million in February 2016. Since that sale, L3 has spent roughly that same amount on acquisitions primarily on technology manufacturers. Major acquisitions in 2016 for L3 include U.K-based airport security technology maker MacDonald Humfrey, pilot training provider Aerosim and Australia-based electronic warfare subsystems provider Micreo Limited. L3 closed its purchase of Implant Sciences’ explosives trace detection business in January and the OceanServer deal took place three months later.

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it By Abby Ohlheiser By Abby Ohlheiser May 22 at 1:06 PM Follow @abbyohlheiser (Courtesy of the Onion) The fast pace of events under President Trump has some good news and some bad news for the Onion and the rest of the Internet’s satirists. The good news is, there’s a lot of material to work with. The bad? There’s so much material, churning through the news cycle at such a speedy pace, that it becomes tough to interject with a joke. “We had a ton of great articles about various parts of the campaign, Trump’s personality, and the people around him,” Onion Editor in Chief Cole Bolton said in an interview with The Post on Friday. “But we felt like each one of those is a drop in the bucket.” So, the Onion is trying something new: Why not flood the Internet with a ton of jokes about the Trump administration, all at once? The Trump Documents, released by the Onion on Monday, are the satirical newspaper’s fictional version of the Pentagon Papers. It’s about 700 pages of fake executive order drafts, emails and classified “documents” that, collectively, are the Onion’s first big swing at capturing this particular political moment. Bolton calls it a mix of “really hard satire” about the administration, its people and its goals, along with some more traditional Onion-y silliness. It’s all supposed to have the feel of a major leak of classified documents. The Trump Documents, in a way, are an attempt at finding a way to produce effective work — in the Onion’s case, satire — in a world where expectations have changed. It’s not that Trump is hard to satirize. It’s that there’s too much to satirize. “We just couldn’t keep up all the time,” Bolton said. “There was just so much to ridicule that it got to be such a drag. I’m sure it’s the same way with regular journalism, just following him all the time would be just tiring.” The Onion is hoping that by flooding the Internet, it will be able to get readers to pause for a moment and take it all in. It is also planning about two weeks of “coverage” of its project — everything from editorials to a Facebook Live rollout, to tweets featuring individual documents from the massive trove. The coverage will mimic the seriousness of a real newspaper covering a major government leak. In one document, Trump is arguing with Boeing’s chief executive about the decor for Air Force One. “Whole interior should be marble,” Trump writes in a (fake) email. “Not just floor.” He wants marble walls, marble doors, marble bathroom fixtures, marble seats, with headrests that are adjustable and marble. The chief executive replies that “it’s just not possible to use marble for every element of the plane’s interior.” Trump persists, he emails back a drawing where every part of the plane is labeled “marble.” There also are fictional memos to Trump from Vice President Pence, which read as if they were written by Cotton Mather. One lists “heretics” in Congress and their suspected crimes (Sen. Elizabeth Warren, for instance, is “head witch”), while another warns the president of a “potential violation” of the first commandment in the Bible. The Onion also took a stab at imagining one of Trump’s presidential briefings. It looks like one of those paper placemats that children doodle on in family restaurants. (Courtesy of the Onion) Bolton estimates that a staff of 20 graphics editors and writers spent “thousands” of hours collectively on the project, which began production shortly after Trump’s inauguration. “It’s been my life, it’s been my first 100 days of the Trump administration,” Bolton said. The hope, he added, is that the Internet will embrace the project as an injection of “humorous catharsis during a very unusual political time,” one that rises above the incremental absurdities of the Internet’s response to these past few months. There’s another possibility, too: What if people actually believe the Onion documents are real? One of the strange things about satire on the Internet recently has been how believable it is. For instance, a Twitter humorist photoshopped the ending of a New York Times story recently to make it appear as if Speaker of the House Paul D. Ryan drove away from the White House blaring Papa Roach’s “Last Resort.”  The humorist had to later clarify that his tweet was just a joke, after a ton of people believed it was a real thing that happened in 2017. And before Trump’s election, there were hoaxes involving faked emails from the Democratic National Committee, including one that tricked viewers into thinking a Hillary Clinton aide had referred to America’s military as a bunch of “idiot soldiers.” [People can’t stop being inspired by this fake clip of a little girl insulting Trump] The Trump Documents, too, look believable, even if the content within them is clearly absurd. Bolton said that his staff spent time tracking down the exact letterheads and fonts to make each document look as authentic as possible. Some pages involve hand-drawn doodles. The rest were printed out after creation and manually re-scanned back into a digital form, to make each image look more like it was really leaked. “It is on our mind,” Bolton said of the possibility that these documents might trick someone into thinking they’re real. But the Onion’s style has always closely mimicked the news it parodies, and the Trump Documents are no different. “I think the reason that the satire sings is because it mimics, say, The Washington Post so closely. We use really dry AP style writing in our headlines,” he said. “We never wink, we never break character.” It seems inevitable that someone is going to think something in this massive trove of 700 very authentic looking documents is the real deal, particularly if individual pages are removed from their original context, as tends to happen on the Internet. But Bolton and his team are hoping that the jokes manage to make themselves clear for what they are. “I hope the satirical stuff resonates with people,” Bolton said. “I think the highest compliment we ever get on our articles — and hopefully on this — is ‘Oh, the Onion nailed it, the Onion captured it perfectly.’ We kind of want it to feel like we captured a moment in the zeitgeist.” More reading:  Trump‏ says he wants ‘to find the LEAKERS.’ The Internet is here to help.

President Donald Trump visited Saudi Arabia over the weekend and sealed $110 billion in deals through which Riyadh will buy U.S. arms to help it counter Iran, with options running as high as $350 billion over 10 years. Shares of defense firms General Dynamics, Raytheon , and Lockheed Martin all hit record highs before easing to trade up between 0.6 percent and 1.6 percent. Boeing was up 1.5 percent and the biggest boost on the Dow. "The bar for success has been set extremely low for President Trump and it seems that he's been able to meet that over the weekend," said Kim Forrest, senior equity research analyst, Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh. Trump's visit is his first foreign trip since taking office and one the White House hopes will shift the focus away from domestic controversies such as his firing of a former FBI head last week and reports of his administration's links to Russia. "Because we were down last week because of political news, the inverse is true too: that nothing bad happened over the weekend in political news," Forrest said.

Gains were broad based, with ten of the eleven S&P sectors trading higher, led by the tech sector's 0.83 increase and the industrials index's 0.67 percent rise. Amazon, Microsoft and Apple were the biggest drivers on the S&P and the Nasdaq. While the strong earnings season and positive economic data will help provide support, the market will continue to be susceptible to political developments and what they mean for Trump's agenda of tax cuts and higher infrastructure spending. "Investors are growing skeptical," Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at BMO Private Bank in Chicago, said in a note. "The likelihood of President Trump's pro-growth agenda getting signed into law is fading as the Administration and Congress fends off and sorts out the constant barrage of headlines." Also bolstering the market was a 0.8 percent gain in oil prices on rising confidence that top exporters will this week agree to extend supply curbs, or even deepen cuts. Ford was up 1.7 percent at $11.05 after the automaker named James Hackett, who heads its unit developing self-driving cars, as chief executive, responding to investors' growing unease about its stock price and prospects.

By Marley Jay, Associated Press | May 22, 2017 at 8:56 am NEW YORK — U.S. stocks rose Monday as the market bounced back from a turbulent week. Defense contractors made gains and technology and consumer-focused companies also rose. Ford shares climbed after the automaker replaced CEO Mark Fields, while chemicals maker Huntsman rose after it agreed to combine with Swiss competitor Clariant. KEEPING SCORE: The Standard & Poor’s 500 index rose 6 points, or 0.3 percent, to 2,388 as of 11:15 a.m. Eastern time. The Dow Jones industrial average added 73 points, or 0.4 percent, to 20,877. The Nasdaq composite gained 30 points, or 0.5 percent, to 6,113. The Russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks picked up 4 points, or 0.3 percent, to 1,371.

The S&P 500 is about 1 percent below its highest close, but the Russell 2000 is down more than 3 percent from the record it set one month ago. AEROSPACE GAINS ALTITUDE: Aerospace and defense companies traded higher after President Trump presided over a $110 billion sale of military equipment to Saudi Arabia. The agreement could expand to $350 billion over 10 years. It appeared to reverse an Obama administration to pause sales of precision-guided munitions to the kingdom. Lockheed Martin climbed $5.35, or 2 percent, to $278.14 and Boeing gained $2.59, or 1.4 percent, to $183.35. Rockwell Automation rose $1.55, or 1 percent, to $158.91. DRIVEN OFF: Ford replaced Chief Executive Mark Fields as the automaker struggles to keep the traditional parts of its business running smoothly while it remakes itself as a nimble, high-tech provider of new mobility services. Fields was CEO for three years, but under his leadership popular cars like the Fusion sedan became dated and Ford lagged competitors in bringing long-range electric cars to market. New CEO is Jim Hackett, who has led Ford’s mobility unit for more than a year. Ford added 15 cents, or 1.3 percent, to $11.02. The stock is down 9 percent this year. CHEMISTRY: Swiss specialty chemicals maker Clariant and Huntsman Corp. are merging to create a company with a market value of $13.8 billion. The company will call itself HuntsmanClariant and Clariant shareholders will own 52 percent of the new company. Huntsman stock was unchanged at $26.71 and Clariant stock rose 5.8 percent in Switzerland. METAL TESTED: Arconic jumped after the aluminum products company ended a contentious proxy dispute with activist investor Elliott Management. Elliott will get more input as Arconic picks its next CEO, and it will nominate three directors to the company’s board. Arconic agreed to nominate two others, and a third board member resigned and was replaced by a candidate Arconic chose. A month ago, Klaus Kleinfeld was ousted as Arconic’s chairman and CEO after he sent a threatening letter to Paul Singer, Elliott’s founder and Arconic’s largest shareholder. Arconic stock gained 32 cents, or 1.1 percent, to $27.90. ENERGY: Oil prices continued to rally and benchmark U.S. crude oil added 51 cents, or 1 percent, to $50.84 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, rose 49 cents to $54.10 a barrel in London. However energy companies traded lower. Halliburton lost 79 cents, or 1.7 percent, to $46.99 and Chevron declined 52 cents to $106. BONDS: Bond prices were little changed. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note remained at 2.24 percent. CURRENCIES: The dollar dipped to 110.97 yen from 111.20 yen late Friday. The euro rose to $1.1243s from $1.1205. OVERSEAS: In Britain, the FTSE 100 gained 0.3 percent. France’s CAC rose was little changed and the German DAX dipped 0.1 percent. Japan’s market rose following strong trade data. The benchmark Nikkei 225 gained 0.5 percent while the South Korean Kospi jumped 0.7 percent. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng surged 0.9 percent. Tags:  Stocks Marley Jay, Associated Press Subscribe Today!

But, for a President Trump, it needed something “much bigger, much broader,” Cole Bolton, the editor-in-chief, said.CreditCOURTESY THE ONION The staff of the Onion, a satirical online newspaper that’s been a reliable antidote to reality for nearly three decades, was not thrilled by the prospect of a Trump Presidency. The paper’s longtime writer Chad Nackers told me in March that the thought of having to frequently satirize Trump and the bit players in his Administration for four years—or more—filled many of the publication’s staffers with “comedic dread.” The Onion has been tormenting Trump for close to twenty years, beginning back when he was a mere citizen-object of scorn, with headlines like 2012’s “Donald Trump Stares Forlornly at Tiny, Aged Penis in Mirror Before Putting On Clothes, Beginning Day” and, from 2013, “When You’re Feeling Low, Just Remember I’ll Be Dead in About 15 or 20 Years.” (The latter provoked Trump’s general counsel, Michael Cohen, to demand an apology to his client. The Onion ignored this request.) But, for a President Trump, Cole Bolton, the Onion’s editor-in-chief, told me last week, “We needed something much bigger, much broader, which can hit all the themes we want to hit in a single stroke.” More than a dozen writers and eight graphics editors have been assembling that something over the past four months: seven hundred pages of Trump-related documents that have been “leaked” to the Onion. The first batch was revealed at noon on Monday on the Onion’s Facebook page, as well as on a special Web site. “Document dumps,” Bolton said, “are the vogue way to talk about major breaking news in the world, whether it’s WikiLeaks or the Panama Papers. Leaks seemed like the perfect means to get at Trump and his inner circle, as well as his decision-making.” Among the leaked Trump documents: a string of e-mails between the President and Boeing’s C.E.O., about Trump’s desired upgrades—marble everything—to Air Force One; some of the Vice-President’s handwritten notes, with helpful illustrations, describing puritanical inventions of his, like a “nose harness” to prevent the smelling of “sinful smells,” like a woman’s skin, and a “blouse that cannot flutter in the wind”; and three of the President’s idiosyncratic daily briefings, written on children’s placemats. “Like you get at Denny’s,” Bolton said. “They say things like, ‘These are the security issues today. Find them in the word box!’ ” There are Mad Libs-style executive orders (“fill-in a ‘fear-inducing noun,’ ” one instructs, then an “adjective that implies ‘sub-human’ without actually stating it”), a note from Obama to Trump that was left in the Oval Office, as well as handwritten letters between Melania Trump and her concerned relatives back in Slovenia. All the documents appear to have originated between Trump’s Inauguration and the current day, with the exception of a few e-mails between the press secretary, Sean Spicer, and Trump, exchanged prior to the election. Trump’s voice is limited in the documents. “His voice is so over-mocked,” Bolton said. “Everyone throws the word ‘huge’ in there and says they’re an orange-so-and-so with small hands. Those jokes are done to death. We wanted to not fall in those traps.” Riffing on the minutiae of the news cycle is generally not the Onion’s goal, and these documents are no different. There are a few items related to the recent James Comey chaos, like a series of very simplistically encrypted e-mails that Sergey Lavrov, Russia’s foreign minister, sent to Trump. (“Flynn has device Moscow is pleased,” one decoded missive reads. Another says, simply, “Focus Donald.”) A few other specific events are mentioned, such as Spicer suggesting that Bashar al-Assad is worse than Hitler. But the documents mostly play on broad themes of the Trump Administration: stupidity, duplicity, and the strategic use of fear. Verisimilitude is critical: White House letterheads, government fonts, official document formatting and style. “We did a lot of background with that stuff,” Bolton said. “Then our graphics team put it all together, so everything looks like it’s official.” There are a few lawsuits that appear to have been filed in court, using the appropriate legalese. (In one, Trump sues a yawning West Wing tour group for not talking to him about his Electoral College victory.) Most painstaking of all, after an Onion staffer typed or hand-wrote the documents, another staffer then printed and scanned each of them, one by one, so that they look like “real leaked documents.” “There always are people who think what we do is real,” Bolton told me. “Our intention is not for them to be perceived as real. It’s to make them look as much like actual things as possible. That helps with the satire. We put a lot of effort into these things not to try to fool people but to try to expose underlying truths, as we see them, about the Trump Administration.” Each day for the next two weeks, the Onion will reveal the leaked documents in the publication’s Facebook Live segments, which were actually prerecorded. An actress in her mid-fifties who also works in communications for an Illinois state agency—and, for that reason, asked to remain anonymous—plays the part of Elizabeth Strickland, the Onion’s Washington bureau chief. “I think what makes the Onion’s satire so strong,” she told me, “is that it’s very straight. You never give away the joke. So I have a lot of straight lines. I’m just reporting on the documents.” She went on, “I said to a producer, ‘Do you want me to show some Anderson Cooper-like concern?’ The producer said, ‘Nope. This is important information to get to the public, but don’t show judgment.’ So I channelled a mix of reporters and anchors, but certainly not the White House press team.” She added, “I will say that you have to have a special kind of talent to do what Kellyanne Conway does and keep a straight face.” Charles Bethea is a freelance journalist based in Atlanta and a regular contributor to The New Yorker and newyorker.com.

Oil prices fell back after Monday's rally. KEEPING SCORE: Japan's Nikkei 225 edged 0.2 percent lower to 19,648.09 and the Shanghai Composite Index fell 0.4 percent to 3,062.85.

Skip to content To Inform is to Influence IO, SC, PD, what's in a name? Menu About Information Operations Holistic Organizers IO, Cyber, SC, PD Community Calendar Name and Shame, Educating the Media Information operations · Information Warfare · Russia Pravda Tells A Doozy Of A Lie May 22, 2017May 22, 2017 Joel Harding Pravda means “Truth” in Russian.   But not according to their latest published fib. Actually, fib is too generous a word, it is a bold, blatant, absolutely boldly fabricated lie.  A doozy! Just published in the last 30 minutes, I almost couldn’t believe the story when I clicked on it. “New secret documents hold Ukraine responsible for MH17 plane crash“Pravda Report 12:06 A Russian newspaper obtained copies of secret documents of the Security Bureau of Ukraine (SBU) about special operations to destroy evidence of mass murder in the sky over the Donbass on July 17, 2014. The Sovershenno Secretno newspaper (translates as “Top Secret”) conducts an investigation into the downing of the Malaysian passenger Boeing over Ukraine. The copies of the documents that the newspaper obtained – orders, coded telegrams and plans – were written on official letterheads of the Ukrainian Security Service. According to the newspaper, Ukrainian President Poroshenko and his generals should be put on trial in The Hague as war criminals. The person who handed the documents to the newspaper, said that it was part of his very long and exhausting work. “In Ukraine, I have a few friends, who are fed up with the fact that other people wipe their feet on them. They are two-faced guys: they want those bastards to be held accountable for what they did, but at the same time, they want a security cushion and offer to buy those documents,” the anonymous source of information said. “Believe me, I just want those bastards from the SBU to get what they deserve,” he added. The newspaper published copies of four criminal orders of the Security Bureau of Ukraine. The information that the documents contain suggests the following: – the new Kiev authorities  – President Poroshenko and his generals – are entirely responsible for the shoot-down of the Malaysian aircraft; – Ukraine’s military aviation was involved in the plane crash; – to cover the traces of the monstrous crime, the SBU had been conducting special operations since the end of July 2014 to destroy the facts of the special operation that pointed to the presence of combat aircraft on combat missions on July 17, 2014. Wrapped up in one nice, neat little package, this “disclosure” gives “damning” evidence of a coverup, calls for President Poroshenko to be arrested, provides motive for the disclosure after the coverup, and it’s all nicely printed on SBU letterhead. Sure it is. The old saying, “if it seems too good to be true, it probably is” applies. After the official investigation into the shootdown concluded Russia shot down the plane, Russia countered with 11 alternative theories. That didn’t work. When Bellingcat did open source investigations and located the actual Buk that shot down MH17, the crew, and the responsible chain of command, Russia pointed a finger elsewhere. The West had one story and all the evidence supported it, and didn’t point anywhere else.  Russia had 11 alternative theories and all the ‘evidence’ was thinly veiled fabrications, and nobody believed them. Is this the truth?  Well, it’s Pravda, which means the truth, but none of this ‘evidence’ has ever surfaced before, none of the so-called witnesses have come forward before, and this appears far too “alternative” to possibly be true. In other words, it’s not pravda (lowercase), it’s a ложь.  A lie.  Advertisements Share this: Pinterest Tumblr LinkedIn Google Twitter Facebook Email Reddit Print Like this: Like Loading...

The Shanghai-based China-Russia Commercial Aircraft International Co Ltd (CRAIC) has completed its business registration and obtained a license to operate, said its Chinese parent, state-owned Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC). COMAC Chairman Jin Zhuanglong said the joint venture marks key progress in a Sino-Russian programme to develop wide-body aircraft and aims to produce "competitive" long-haul planes for the world's aviation market. CRAIC will be responsible for research, manufacturing, marketing, sales and services of its aircraft. According to an agreement by COMAC and its Russian partner United Aircraft Corp (UAC), 280-seat jets with a range of 12,000 kilometers will be prioritised. The aircraft design process will soon begin, according to the plan. The general assembly line will be based in Shanghai. An eight-member strong board of directors, half from China and half from Russia, will be headed by UAC Vice President Vladislav Masalov. Earlier this month, COMAC's narrow-body passenger aircraft C919 completed its maiden flight. The C919 is China's first domestically-produced large aircraft, designed to rival Airbus' updated A320 and Boeing's new generation B737. COMAC already has two aircraft from its regional model ARJ21 on the mark, state-run Xinhua news agency reported.
