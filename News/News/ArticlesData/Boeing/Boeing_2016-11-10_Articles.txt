Whittington Follow Following Rate the news Is NASA looking at commercial alternative to the Orion? Deep space versions of the Boeing CST-100 and the SpaceX Dragon could fly to the moon and beyond Low NASA Budgets Threaten Spaceflight Safety: Report - space.com Advertisements #Donald Trump is not yet president of the United States but NASA is already drumming up some options for his incoming NASA Administrator concerning what kind of vehicles will take astronauts into deep #Space, according to Ars Technica. In a Request for Information concerning the Orion deep spaceship the space agency has quietly asked commercial companies if they might have any alternatives. Boeing and #SpaceX are already developing spacecraft that will take astronauts to and from the International Space Station. Blue Origin envisions taking passengers to low Earth orbit on its planned New Glenn launch vehicle and beyond in the follow on New Armstrong. The Orion, along with the Space Launch System heavy-lift rocket, is far along in its development cycle. A version of the spacecraft has already flown on a Delta IV Heavy rocket. Another Orion is slated for an uncrewed mission around the moon in 2018. A third Orion will take a crew of astronauts on a lunar orbital mission in the 2021-23 timeframe. Beyond that, the manifest for deep space missions is a little vague. The incoming Trump administration has expressed support for more commercial participation in NASA’s space exploration program. So it makes sense to explore deep space versions of the Boeing CST-100 Starliner and the SpaceX Dragon, not to mention other possibilities. On the other hand, an attempt to cancel the Orion in favor of another, cheaper vehicle is likely to spark a fight with Congress, already irate over President Barack Obama’s cancellation of the Constellation space exploration program. Orion’s supporters will point out that the NASA spaceship already exists and is being built. Commercial spacecraft are right now concepts, not even designs. On the other hand, supplementing Orion with commercial spacecraft is always a possible option. The Trump administration’s space exploration program is quite ambitious, involving astronaut voyaging throughout the solar system by 2100. Enough room may exist for both Orion and commercially built deep spacecraft. And, if NASA is headed back to the moon under the new order, commercially developed landing vehicles is always a possibility.

Donald Trump bought this Boeing 757 in 2011 and spent millions converting it into a penthouse in the sky, long before he decided to run for president Amanda Miller, the Trump Organization's Vice President of Marketing, is pictured on board Mr Trump's plane. She gave a video tour of the plane in 2011, after it was refitted  HOW DO THEY MEASURE UP?  Air Force One Obama boarding Air Force One in London  A customized Boeing 747-200B, bearing the words 'United States of America' and the President's seal  Top speed of 563mph and room for an entire West Wing of presidential advisers  A mobile command center, 4,000 square feet of floor space on three levels, a medical suite/operating room, two food preparation galleys which can feed 100 people     Trump's plane Trump boards his plane in North Carolina  A Boeing 757-200, which was bought in 2011 and kitted out at a cost of $100m, it is embossed with the legend 'Trump' Top speed of 500mph and space for 43 passengers   Marble and gold bathroom, 24-carat gold-plated seatblets, a video lounge with 57-inch screen and sound system similar to a 'top Hollywood screening room'   In fact there are two Air Force One planes. They are identical Boeing 747s which are rotated every few months.  Air Force One are customized Boeing 747-200B aircraft, which carry the tail codes 28000 and 29000.  They are given the special designation VC-25A and fly under the strictest security. White House in the sky: One of the two Air Force One jumbos is seen flying President Bill Clinton to Italy in 1999. Hillary only ever flew on it as a First Lady  Air Force One is emblazoned with the words United States of America, a flag on the tail and the Seal of the President. It can be refueled in midair, giving it an unlimited range and can stay in the hour for many hours if required to by an extraordinary crisis.  Air Force One's onboard electronics are designed to withstand an electromagnetic pulse, and it is equipped with advanced secure communications equipment, allowing it to function in the event of an attack on the White House.

Share this article Share 1.9k shares President Trump will be protected on board by Secret Service officers but can also invite onto the plane political advisers, journalists and other guests, including of course his wife Melania and other members of his family.  But it will be a far cry from the luxury of Trump's own plane, sometimes known as Trump Force One, which has wood panelling and 'yards and yards of elegant silk', silk pillows embroidered with his family crest and gold and marble bathrooms.  Air Force One usually flies in convoy with several cargo planes, containing surplus stores, and fighter jets. President Barack Obama wears an Air Force One jacket on his first flight aboard the famous plane from Andrews Air Force Base to Newport News, Virginia in February 2009 President Obama and many of his predecessors have often opted to use a helicopter, known as Marine One, for short flights from Washington for example to New York or to Camp David, the presidential retreat in the Maryland countryside.   The presidential air fleet is operated by the 89th Airlift Wing at Andrews Field, Maryland.  The Presidential Airlift Group, part of the White House Military Office, is in charge of Air Force One.  On the campaign trial: Trump gives a thumbs up to the crowd after a rally in Vandailia, Ohio way back in March 2016. He was able to sleep in his bed on board while flitting between campaign stops Trump Force One, or the 'T-Bird' as the tycoon refers to it, is luxuriously fitted out (pictured) The bedroom on Trump's plane, where he often napped while flying between cities on the campaign trial, is complete with silk pillows containing his family crest (pictured)  Trump and his campaign organizers would have sat around this conference table discussing speeches and tactics over the last few months Amanda Miller (pictured) graduated from the University of Rhode Island and worked as the receptionist on the 2008 season of Celebrity Apprentice. She was hired by Trump after working as a 15-year-old waitress at his golf course in Westchester, New York Amanda Miller shows off the bathroom on board Trump Force One (left) but security is much tighter on board Air Force One (pictured, right, during a trip to Baghdad in 2006) In May 2009 Louis Caldera resigned as director of the White House Military Office after an embarrassing incident - New Yorkers panicked when they saw Air Force One flying low around the city.  It turned out to be a photo opportunity but many people thought the U.S. was under attack again like on 9/11. In 1974 the Air Force One pilot took dramatic evasive action, including a dive, when, on its approach to Damascus for an official visit, President Richard Nixon's plane was approached by Syrian fighter jets. Trump was able to travel in extreme comfort on his plane (pictured) while keeping in contact with his staff on the ground. It is not clear what will become of the plane in January Amanda Miller, who was hired by Trump after he spotted her working as a 15-year-old waitress, is pictured showing off the tycoon's $100m plane  Goodbye, Mr President: A rainbow in Kingston, Jamaica, frames Obama as he boards Air Force One at Norman Manley International Airport after a trip to the Caribbean President Hafez al-Assad - father of the current dictator, Bashir - a former air force officer himself, had sent the planes up to escort Nixon's plane but they had failed to notify the crew of Air Force One.   Vice President-elect Mike Pence, by the way, will have his own Boeing C-32, which is also fitted out to be a mobile command center in the event of the President's sudden death. It is known as Air Force Two.

Saudia Director General Saleh Bin Nasser Al-Jasser, Saudi media and some of the airlines employees were the passengers of the new aircraft that flew in from Seattle on Nov. 9, and landed in Riyadh the next day. Minister of Transport and President of the General Authority of Civil Aviation (GACA), Sulaiman Al-Hamdan with Saudia Director General Saleh Bin Nasser Al-Jasser at the press conference. — Courtesy photoOnce the airplane arrived in the Riyadh private aviation area on Nov.10, Minister of Transport and President of the General Authority of Civil Aviation (GACA), Sulaiman Al-Hamdan celebrated with Al-Jasser, and other officials, the arrival of the new airplane to the fleet. During the press conference held soon after the plane had arrived, Al-Hamdan said, “I am pleased to see today the new product of the Saudi Arabian Airlines that includes special suites in the first class of the new Boeing 777-300ER aircraft. “This step confirms the interest and care of the national aviation to develop its products, which has become an important element within the competitive advantages between airlines.” Al-Hamdan added, during his speech, that it is worthwhile to note that aligning with the Kingdom Vision 2030 the civil aviation and air transport industry is an important element that is sure to play a vital role in developing the national economy. He also stressed on the efforts that are being made for the development of the air transport system in the Kingdom in order for it to play its role more effectively in the overall development programs, which is part of achieving the National Transformation Program of 2020. The minister added that the Saudi Arabian Airlines is following effective steps to implement its development program to achieve transformation and to attain its strategic objectives. The airlines recently implemented several changes including, developing the aircraft fleet and developing the airlines products and improving its services. “There are other effective steps that are being implemented for the development of the air transport industry in the Kingdom. One of the steps that was recently implemented and was successful was the transference to Terminal 5 in King Khaled Airport in Riyadh and smooth operations of the flights, while also launching Nesma and Gulf Saudia airlines flights. Other efforts have also been made to achieve the new developing goals that would support the national economy,” he said. During the conference Al-Jasser explained that he is pleased with the launching of the new product that includes suites in first class and he illustrated that having another 777-300 ER to the airlines fleet is part of the airlines goals. By implementing the goals of the program, the airlines will increase the achievements of 70 years, especially in the coming 7 years through many initiatives. Al-Jasser added several initiatives have been implemented including, the signing of an agreement with the Ministry of Education to give thousands of Saudis scholarships to study aviation and aviation engineering. “We also signed another agreement for having around 113 aircrafts that are newly produced to be added to the airlines fleet and we have started receiving some of these starting from August,” Al-Jasser added. During the media conference it was explained that the new plane has 12 distinguished compartments for the first class passengers each with an electronic seat which can easily be adjusted for complete relaxation and can also be made into a comfortable bed. There is an electronic keyboard that will enable the passenger to control the seat, which is supplied with a flexible lighting system. There is also space to store their personal belongings. Each wing will also have sliding doors to provide the passenger with more space and a 24-inch HD plasma that will enable him/her to enjoy the entertainment programs throughout the flight in addition to a large dining table for two people to be served with food. Saudia has concluded an agreement with Boeing to purchase 10 such aircraft four of which will be received later this year and five in 2017.

NHTSA recommends owners check for recall information, and if their vehicle is part of the recall, contact a local dealer for a free repair. Just in case you haven’t heard, the City of Chicago is in deep trouble with their employee pension costs. Chicago will pay about $1 billion next year into four separate pension funds. To cover that in part, their city council increased telephone surcharges in 2014, adding about $35 million a year in revenues. A 2015 property tax increase will raise taxes by $543 million over the next four years. On September 14, 2016 their city council voted to raise water and sewer taxes to generate an additional $240 million annually by 2020. A new study could reassure men with early prostate cancer that whether they opt for radiation, surgery or no treatment, their risk of dying of the disease in ten years is very low, less than one percent. Otis Brawley, chief medical officer of the American Cancer Society, said new studies add to mounting evidence that men with localized prostate cancer can safely opt to postpone treatment. Our State Senator Holly Mitchell’s sponsored bill, SB629, has been signed by Governor Brown and goes into effect on January 1, 2017. The Senator’s bill does not alter the penalties, but simply removes the inflammatory and misused term from the penal code as it relates to lynching. The number of federal inmates who are serving time for drug offenses, among them thousands of nonviolent offenders sentenced to life without the possibility of parole, is 100,000. If I lived in McKinney, Texas and wanted that city to furnish public documents under the Texas Public Information Act relating to a white police officer pointing his gun at black youths, it would require 2,231 hours of programmer time at a cost approaching $80,000. This figure is so high, it effectively keeps information hidden that the city is legally obligated to provide. United Airlines found Boeing’s new plane, the 787-9, has such a range that it flies nonstop between San Francisco and Tel Aviv and Singapore and Auckland. Yes, folks, the 787-9 will carry 252 passengers 8,786 miles. My, oh my, have things changed. Recently Vietnam bought commercial aircraft worth $11 billion. For travelers, Holiday Inn Express was ranked number 1 in customer service and #1 in trust. My former employer, the Boeing Aircraft Company, is a proving ground for the robotizing of the production assembly line for the 777 jet. As these robots displace workers, the companies are hiring a highly trained group of human workers to fix robots when they break down or need maintenance. Recently Boeing projected airlines would need 617,000 pilots in the next 20 years worldwide and an additional 20,000 pilots over the next 10 years here in the United States. Can it be true, folks? According to disclosure reports filed Thursday, June 30 with the Florida State Commission on Ethics, for the period January 1, 2015 to December 15, 2015 the Florida Attorney General, Pam Bondi, last year earned $128,872. To put it in perspective, the top super-duper Culver City City Attorney, Carol Schwab, made over $100,000 more than Bondi. That’s right. Carol, representing 40, 000 residents, made more than Bondi, representing millions of people in the Sunshine State. Did you read the Reno, Nevada Gazette – Journal recently? Well, partner, it seems their city attorney was involved in settling a lawsuit against a police officer accused of assaulting a man during a traffic stop. I bet you are wondering about the cost. Well, it was a $23,000 settlement. As of June 1 the good people of Idaho are able to carry a concealed gun without needing a license or training. Now that the United States made Cuba our friend again, Cousin Neil was looking forward to restocking his shelves with rum and cigars, but, alas, the only product that was removed from the list of items barred from being imported from Cuba was coffee, and that will probably be on your favorite supermarket shelf around the first of December. I will try it, but the coffee will have to be marvelous to keep me away from my Yuban.

Donald Trump bought this Boeing 757 in 2011 and spent millions converting it into a penthouse in the sky, long before he decided to run for president Amanda Miller, the Trump Organization's Vice President of Marketing, is pictured on board Mr Trump's plane.

They are identical Boeing 747s which are rotated every few months.  Air Force One are customized Boeing 747-200B aircraft, which carry the tail codes 28000 and 29000.  They are given the special designation VC-25A and fly under the strictest security.

Hillary only ever flew on it as a First Lady  Air Force One is emblazoned with the words United States of America, a flag on the tail and the Seal of the President. It can be refueled in midair, giving it an unlimited range and can stay in the hour for many hours if required to by an extraordinary crisis.  Air Force One's onboard electronics are designed to withstand an electromagnetic pulse, and it is equipped with advanced secure communications equipment, allowing it to function in the event of an attack on the White House.

President Barack Obama wears an Air Force One jacket on his first flight aboard the famous plane from Andrews Air Force Base to Newport News, Virginia in February 2009 President Obama and many of his predecessors have often opted to use a helicopter, known as Marine One, for short flights from Washington for example to New York or to Camp David, the presidential retreat in the Maryland countryside.   The presidential air fleet is operated by the 89th Airlift Wing at Andrews Field, Maryland.  The Presidential Airlift Group, part of the White House Military Office, is in charge of Air Force One.  On the campaign trial: Trump gives a thumbs up to the crowd after a rally in Vandailia, Ohio way back in March 2016.

In 1974 the Air Force One pilot took dramatic evasive action, including a dive, when, on its approach to Damascus for an official visit, President Richard Nixon's plane was approached by Syrian fighter jets. Trump was able to travel in extreme comfort on his plane (pictured) while keeping in contact with his staff on the ground.

I’ll never forget a couple of years ago waking up at 4am in St Lucia and hearing the dawn chorus as the sun rose above the Pitons, knowing that back home it was a bitter, murky February day. Or the sheer excitement of threading through the cloud-capped Andes to land at Quito airport, the first time I visited South America. And it seems I’m not alone. This year’s Telegraph Travel survey revealed that our readers’ list of favourite destinations was dominated by faraway places. Only one of your top 20, Italy, was in Europe.  TOP 20 | The worlds best countries - according to you (2016) Of course, there is a potential downside to visiting these fascinating places; to get there you have to sit on a plane for hours on end. And while there have been some improvements for long-haul fliers – the introduction of the highly rated Boeing Dreamliner, for example – other news, such as this week’s revelations that BA is to cram even more seats into some of its planes, isn’t so encouraging. But there is still a lot you can do to make long-haul flying more affordable and more bearable.  Here we have set out the best strategies for planning and booking your trip. First among them is the importance of talking to a knowledgeable specialist travel agent before you book. Buying long-haul flights is not the same as picking up a return fare to Europe – especially to destinations in South America, Asia and Australasia. There are many more options regarding your choice of airline, timing and itinerary. Fares are also structured differently, and agents have access to rates and deals you can’t get by booking directly with the airline. It’s also one of those areas where talking through your plans with an expert can pay dividends beyond the simple cost of the flight. They will have ideas and insights that you probably haven’t thought of, and which you could never track down by surfing online. They may even suggest a routing via a country you hadn’t even considered visiting, but which might make the journey more bearable and the holiday more enjoyable. All the fares quoted in this article were provided by Trailfinders (020 7938 3939; trailfinders.com), which, over many years, has consistently topped our annual readers’ survey. They are all return fares from London airports, are normally subject to booking by a certain date, and are valid for a particular time of year – often in this case May 2017. Please treat them as indicative – fares change all the time, and offers are ended, extended and introduced at short notice. As ever, talking to more than one company is a good idea and will give you a better picture of what is going on. You are probably spending a lot of money, and it never hurts to get two or three competitive quotes. Other agents that still offer a good customer-focused service include Dialaflight (0330 100 2220; dialaflight.com) and STA (0333 321 0099; statravel.co.uk). And specialist long-haul tour operators – Kuoni (0800 144 8156; kuoni.co.uk) for example – are useful if you want to book a hotel or resort-based holiday. Choose the right airline ￼The first point to consider when booking a long flight is which airline you prefer to fly with, though you might be choosing for two different reasons – price and comfort. In terms of overall experience, the top three airlines for long-haul travel, as rated by Telegraph readers in our latest annual travel survey, were Emirates, Singapore Airlines and Air New Zealand. Just because they are good doesn’t necessarily mean that they are expensive. Currently you can get to Perth, Australia, with Emirates (via Dubai from Gatwick) from £499; and good fares in business class with Singapore Airlines and a round-the-world bargain with Air New Zealand are listed below. Be wary, though, of code-share arrangements which mean that although your ticket is booked through one airline, you may actually be flying with another – and it isn’t always easy to tell from your booking details.  Revealed: The worlds best airlines Another key point to consider is the type of plane. There is a general consensus that flying on one of the new Boeing Dreamliners is a vastly more relaxing and enjoyable experience than on, for example, an old 747. More and more airlines now offer them on flights from Britain: including British Airways, Virgin Atlantic, Air Canada, United Airlines, Etihad, Qatar Airways, Kenya Airways, Aeromexico, Avianca and Air India. And some charter flights are also operated on Dreamliners – Tui, for example, flies them. But they only fly on certain routes and at particular times, and working out which is also difficult without advice from an agent. The Airbus equivalent to the Boeing 787 Dreamliner is the A350, which has recently started flying to Britain with Qatar Airways, Cathay Pacific, Finnair and Ethiopian Airlines. A new breed of no-frills, low-cost long-haul airlines is also offering a growing number of long-haul destinations – especially in the United States. Try Norwegian (norwegian.com) and Wowair (wowair.co.uk), which flies via Reykjavik. Finally, if you want to research more deeply into the quality of seat and service offered by other airlines, there are useful details on the amount of legroom and ratings for all carriers on websites such as airlinequality.com or seatguru.com. Low-cost long haul Take advantage of special offers ￼You will almost certainly also want to choose your flights according to price. This is where the long-haul market becomes really complicated and a good agent’s advice can pay off. Offers come and go, and may be on airlines or routes that you might not immediately think of, but, if you don’t mind a longer journey, can be exceptionally good value. So, for example, you can currently get to Sydney with China Eastern airlines (via Shanghai) from £611. There is a fare to Johannesburg with KLM and Air France, changing at Amsterdam on the way out and Paris on the way back, at £475. And the cheapest ticket to Bangkok is with Air China (via Beijing) at £361. When speaking to an agent, it is also always worth asking about “IT” fares. These are special deals that reduce the cost of your ticket by including a hotel as part of a “package” price along with the flight. It sounds counterintuitive, but it is one of the ways that airlines offload spare capacity on flights they know won’t sell out and so get around formal rules on pricing. So, for example, you can fly to Sydney with Malaysia Airlines and include five nights at a three-star hotel on arrival for £699 (per person, based on two travelling together and sharing a room). The cheapest ticket to Bangkok is currently with Air China Credit: ALAMY Plan a stopover ￼If you can plan your trip to include a stopover for a night or two, you might not only enhance your holiday experience but also make the journey much more bearable, and very possibly – because of IT fare rules (above) – cheaper too. So, for example, Trailfinders has what amounts to a flexible package to New Zealand which, for £1,639, gives you three nights in a four-star hotel in Los Angeles on your way out, and two nights in a three-star Auckland hotel on arrival, then eight days’ motorhome hire in New Zealand. You can then extend your trip in whatever way you like. AT A GLANCE | How to beat jet lag Planning a stopover may also help you to avoid what I think is the real killer on a long-haul journey – the night flight. Not everyone agrees: some can sleep on a plane without a problem and see it as a time-saving advantage. But for me, they are a guaranteed way to lose sleep, and a stopover may allow you to recalibrate your departure times to reduce the amount of night flying. For some destinations, there is not much you can do. Flying to Cape Town, for example, it is overnight both ways. On a few routes, however – notably Boston and New York with BA – you can fly both out and back during daylight, with the added advantage that daytime flights are often less popular with businessmen who are short of time, and so they are likely to be cheaper and less crowded.  Consider a long weekend in LA en route to New Zealand Credit: Andrew Bayda - Fotolia/Andrew Bayda Fly east to west  ￼This strategy obviously only works if you arrange to fly round the world (RTW) rather than out and back. But, if you are particularly susceptible to the effects of jet lag, it is a plan worth considering for trips to Australia, New Zealand or even Hong Kong. The idea is that you avoid the worst effects of jet lag because your body tends to adjust more easily to the new time zone if you travel in a westerly direction. When you arrive, you can sleep in for longer, rather than find yourself lagging behind the clock, although the time you gain on each leg will be lost the moment you cross the International Date Line in the Pacific Ocean. Suddenly an entire day will be wiped out. It’s only when you travel the other way, like Phileas Fogg, that you will gain a day – though it comes at the cost of losing out on each leg.  The round-the-world option works particularly well for travel to New Zealand. One of the cheapest RTW tickets is the Tiki fare with Air New Zealand, which would allow you, for example, to stop in San Francisco en route to Auckland, then return via a stop in Hong Kong for £1,115. This compares with a normal standard return price of about £1,000.  Other options via Australia are a ticket with Qantas and British Airways routing from London to Sydney via Los Angeles and returning via Dubai from £1,414, and you can add extra stops in Auckland and certain Asian cities relatively cheaply. Top 10 | Cheapest long-haul destinations Fly off-peak  ￼The less crowded the flight, the better the chance of good service, the more space and the more “fresh” air you will get during the flight. In theory, working out the busiest times is complicated – especially if your itinerary involves more than one leg. However, it is generally worth avoiding weekends and particularly Mondays, which is the busiest flying day of the week. But in practice, the rule is a simple one – because fares are priced according to demand, the cheaper the fare, the more likely it is that there will be fewer people on the plane. Bag the best seat ￼If you are stuck with flying in economy, you can improve the experience by making sure you get a decent seat. There is a huge difference between stretching your legs out by the emergency exit and being squashed into a middle seat in the back row by the loos. The problem is that almost every airline has a different policy and most now charge for the better seats, or just the privilege of selecting your preferred option. British Airways, for example, charges £20 per person for an economy-class standard long-haul seat request, or £50 for an economy-class exit seat. And Emirates charges for economy-class seat requests on special offer and saver fares but not other fare types – the charges range from £10 to £30 depending on flight duration. They do not charge for exit-seat requests; however, this can only be done at the airport and is at the discretion of the airport staff. Again, this is something that it is worth taking advice on from an agent who knows the different policies and can see at a glance if, for example, an exit-row seat is available and what it will cost. If you are choosing a seat, your preferred option will probably depend on the type of plane, and the configuration of the seats. You can check this on the airline’s website or on a useful specialist site, seatguru.com. Its interactive seating plans highlight individual seats with most legroom, and flag up those with particular disadvantages. You won’t always be able to bag the best seats – they may have been taken already. But you can make sure you avoid the worst. Ones to avoid in particular are bulkhead seats: those are the ones near the front of each section in economy class. These are where parents with very young babies are often seated – not ideal on a night flight. Those in the last row often don’t recline. And any seat near a lavatory is likely to suffer from disturbance, as passengers queue to use it.

You have much more space, you can usually lie flat if you want to and the food is much better, with more choice over what and when you eat. You have access to the lounge before departure and you can be – if you so choose – last on, and first off the plane. You also get a more generous luggage allowance. But the price difference is, of course, very significant. Currently, for example, you could fly to Sydney with BA for £715 return in economy class, but you would have to pay more than five times more (£3,705) to fly in club. With Virgin to LA, you would pay £631 in economy, and £2,982 in business class – again about five times the price. The secret to getting a free upgrade Play! 01:59 There is a middle way. Several airlines offer premium economy, which gives you a bigger seat, less-crowded cabin and a bit more legroom, and for that the extra cost is more moderate – £1,084 for the LA fare just quoted, though £1,913 for Sydney fare. Part of the problem is the very high rates of British departure tax applied to travel in business and premium economy class – £150 for a flight over 2,000 miles. You can get around these, and reduce the fare a lot, if you book the outward leg in economy and the return in club or premium. So that fare to Sydney reduces to £2,202 if you fly out in economy and back in business. Do it the other way around – out in business, back in economy – however, and because of the way that tax is applied, it will cost you £2,277. Again, look out for special offers – British Airways is offering a return to Lima with an upgrade to premium economy on the way home for £145 extra; Malaysian Airlines is offering return flights to Perth, Australia, for £2,299 in business class (via Kuala Lumpur); and Singapore Airlines has a business-class offer to Sydney from £2,739. On the flight ￼Everyone has their own ways of coping with a flight. Olympian Greg Rutherford recommends noise-cancelling headphones to dull the continual roar of the engines, for example. I prefer to bring snacks and water rather than rely on cabin service; an iPad rather than a laptop – easier to use, at least in economy class; and a neck pillow – vital to prevent cricks and cramps.

(Source: File Photo) Boeing has said it is in talks with Indian companies to collaborate under the ‘Make in India’ initiative to manufacture Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) that could be used for surveillance by the Indian Navy. Brad Jeisman, Senior Business Development Manager of Insitu Pacific which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Boeing, said since the Indian Navy is looking to acquire a UAS, it is “actively working” on it. “We had discussions with a number of Indian companies on what could be possible to support our make and buy Indian (products). We are working with different companies. We are meeting with some of the larger ones that we typically expect, but we are also interested in small to medium scale industries,” Jeisman said. Watch what else is making news Insitu Pacific builds UAS, apart from Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems (RPAS), Unattended Ground Sensors (UGS) and Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs) and supplies it to Australia and other countries in Asia-Pacific. Under the UAS, it manufactures ‘ScanEagle’ that gives images and live video feed on land or at sea and can be used for surveillance methods. ‘Interceptor’ is another such UAS with cameras and communication capabilities. Boeing recently announced its joint venture with the Tatas namely Tata advanced System Ltd (TASL) – Tata Boeing Aerospace Limited (TBAL). He said the company is also in talks with small and medium enterprises in India. Talks are also in progress on how much per cent of the product could be manufactured in India under the ‘Make in India’ initiative, he added. “What we have found in our discussions, observations and meetings that India has incredibly gifted small and medium-sized companies with amazing technology on your doorstep,” Jeisman said.

Emirates’ fleet of all Airbus A380 and Boeing 777 aircraft will have a smaller environmental impact as both aircraft types have better fuel efficiency and emissions performance than the retired aircraft, the airline said in a statement. It added that it plans to further phase out some 25 aircraft over the course of 2017 and 2018 to ensure that the operating fleet remains modern and efficient. Emirates recently retired A6-EAK from operational service. The aircraft was the last of the 29 Airbus A330 aircraft that had been operating as part of its fleet. A6-EAK joined Emirates in 2002 and had flown for over 60,000 hours, travelling close to 45 million kilometres in 14.5 years. Emirates also phased out A6-ERN, the last serving Airbus A340 in the fleet which had joined the airline in 2004. Advertisement Since January 2015, Emirates has retired 18 A330 and five A340 aircraft from its fleet. The average age of the Airbus A330 and A340 aircraft phased out from the fleet is 16.5 years — a figure that is well below the industry standard retirement age of 25 years, Emirates said. By the end of 2016, Emirates will have taken delivery of 36 new aircraft; 20 Airbus A380s and 16 Boeing 777. This also includes the next generation Boeing 777-300ER aircraft, with upgraded business class seats and other features including a lower fuel burn ratio. These will be delivered from November 2016. Emirates is currently the largest operator of the Airbus A380 and Boeing 777 aircraft with 85 Airbus A380s and 160 Boeing 777s in its fleet.

WOLE OYEBADE, who was in Dubai, United Arab Emirates (UAE), writes on the feat that puts the airline ahead of the pack. Safety and Emergency Procedure Instructor at Emirates Airlines, Walid Mansy, briskly walked the gallery conducting his guests round the Simulator area. Done with the introduction of first two stationary aircraft-prototypes, he turned to the guests with a smile, arm stretched at the last simulator and announced, “that is the A330/340 simulator, but we no longer use such aircraft at the Emirates.” Not quiet a few of the visiting journalists were surprised at the declaration and they didn’t hide it. Walid got the message too and quickly offered: “From this month, we only operate triple sevens and 380s. Before, we used to have A330 and 340, but we don’t use them anymore,” he said with air of pride. The perplexity was not limited to the journalists from Nigeria; it actually reverberated around the world of aviation. Just imagine; 251 brand new wide-body A380 and 777 aircraft with the latest state-of-the-art gadgets assembled all as one airline! “That is what Emirates now offers; the youngest fleet in the world,” Walid said. Divisional Vice President, Customer Experience IFE and Connectivity at Emirates, Patrick Brannelly, had last month announced that the airline would be phasing out its remaining A330-200s and A340-300s. The planes being retired in 2016 are 12 A330-300s, four A340-300s, one A340-500, six Boeing 777-200ERs, two Boeing 777-300s and one Boeing 777-300ER. Era of A380 and Boeing triple-seven machine In matters of modernity, comfort and efficiency, Airbus 380 and Boeing 777 are front runners. A380 is a double-deck, wide-body, four-engine jet airliner designed for modern airports with upgraded facilities. It is the world’s largest passenger airliner with amazing fuel-efficiency designed by the European Union manufacturer to challenge Boeing’s monopoly in the large-aircraft market. The aircraft provides seating for 525 people in a typical three-class configuration or up to 853 people in an all-economy class configuration. As of October 2016, Airbus had received 319 firm orders and delivered 198 aircraft; Emirates is the biggest A380 customer with 142 ordered of which 83 have been delivered. Boeing 777, which Airbus currently rivals, indeed ranks as one of Boeing’s best-selling models. Airlines around the world have acquired the type as a comparatively fuel-efficient alternative to other wide-body jets and have increasingly deployed the aircraft on long-haul transoceanic routes. The competition between Airbus and Boeing notwithstanding, both makes a good couple in a marriage consummated by Emirates airlines jostling for 100 per cent efficiency. “Emirates is removing some of the older Airbus A330 and A340 jets, both of which are very fuel-inefficient,” said Saj Ahmad, chief analyst at Strategic Aero Research. Fuel is the largest component of an airline’s cost. For Emirates, fuel accounted for about 28 per cent of its operating cost, according to its latest financial results. “The airline is removing not just old jets. It reduces costs by not having to support an ageing fleet and can redeploy pilots and crew on newer jets in its fleet,” Ahmad said. It didn’t come cheap The achievement, 251 aircraft-fleet today, didn’t happen overnight. Way back in November 2001, in the heat of one of the worst crises in the global aviation industry, Emirates took the world by surprise announcing that it has placed a $15billion order for new set of aircraft. As if to prove skeptics wrong, the airline in 2005, announced the largest order ever for the Boeing 777 family of aircraft – 42 in all – in a deal worth DH35.7 billion ($9.7 billion). Not done, at the Dubai Airshow in November 2007, Emirates announced a historic civil aviation aircraft order when it signed contracts for 120 Airbus A350s, 11 A380s, and 12 Boeing 777-300ERs, worth an estimated $34.9 billion in list prices. The agreement with Airbus comprises firm orders for 50 A350-900s and 20 A350-1000s, plus 50 options for the A350-900s, with the plan to have the first A350 delivered to Emirates in 2015. During 2010, in line with the airline’s strategic growth plan, Emirates significantly increased its order for new aircraft. In June at the Berlin Airshow, Emirates announced an order for an additional 32 Airbus A380s and in July at the Farnborough Airshow, 30 more Boeing 777-300ERs were ordered. The combined value of these orders is $13.4 billion. A year after, at the Dubai Airshow, Emirates placed the single largest aircraft order in dollar value in Boeing’s history when it requested an additional 50 777-300ERs, worth approximately $18 billion. The order also included 20 777-300 ER options valued at $8 billion, for a total of 70 aircraft valued at $26 billion. Today, Emirates order-book stands at more than 280 aircraft, with a total value of approximately $138 billion as of November 2014. In combination with what is already one of the youngest and one of the most modern fleets in worldwide commercial aviation, this commitment to the future reflects its ultimate goal to develop Dubai into a comprehensive, global, long-haul aviation hub. Built for comfort Mansy said that the feat was part of the goal at Emirate, to keep the fleet young and maximise the comfort available to its passengers. According to him, “What happen is after sometime, we replace the old one. And when we replace, we always target the new ones. Both 777s and the 380s are the most advanced aircraft that are flying now and can offer a lot of facilities to the passengers, fuel economy cost, long destinations and others are considered. We want aircraft that can go everywhere in comfort. The average years of our fleet are four to six years.” And indeed, depending on the ticket affordable by a passenger – First Class, Business or Economy – the aircraft types are programmed for maximum comfort. From private suites to shower spas in First Class to flat-bed seats in Business Class and extra leg room in Economy, along with in-flight Wi-Fi throughout the aircraft, a journey on this aircraft is truly comfortable. Beginning from 2003, Emirates started the delivery of the award winning Information Communication and Entertainment (ICE) system on board. The system affords a passenger between 24 to 42 inches personal TV screen to watch latest movie and music collections, podcasts and audio-books as well as live television programme. Today, phone and Wi-Fi services that used to be a no-no, are now possible some 35,000-plus above sea-level. It is indeed a bedroom experience on a six or 10 hours flight. With 251 aircraft on its fleet, Emirate currently delivers 420 flights to 153 destinations a day.  Emirates’ mainline passenger fleet constitutes at least 85 A380-800s, 10 B777-200(LR)s, 10 B777-300s and 124 B777-300(ERs). Training Specialists at Emirates Aviation College (EAC), Dubai, Dennis Kelly, noted that the services would not have been possible without huge investment in training programme that prepare crewmember, ab initio and recurrent, for the onboard hospitality. Conducting the team of visiting Nigerian journalists round the college, Kelly informed that the EAC welcomes no fewer than 5000 new cabin crew members and 16,000 recurrent for re-skilling every year (2015 figures). One of the special trainings on offer, besides safety and group medicals, is onboard sales of duty-free goods to Emirates customers. While no less than 26 A330 and 340 were phased out – either leased or sold out – the airlines will have over 320 aircraft by 2018 and 400 aircraft in its fleet by 2020. More than just acquiring a new fleet and outdoing its competitors, the mood of the likes of Walid, Kelly and a host of others at the college suggests a gulf airline that is indeed the programmed workhorse of a larger vision. A vision that is Dubai, to be the hub of global tourism, beginning from when passengers step on board the Emirates airplane anywhere in the world.

Skip to content Satellite Press Releases Satellite Press Releases and News Avcorp Awarded Long-Term Production Contract from Fuji Heavy Industries Avcorp to produce composite components for use with aircraft wings VANCOUVER, Nov. 10, 2016 /PRNewswire/ – Avcorp Industries Inc. (TSX: AVP) (the “Company”, “Avcorp” or the “Avcorp Group”) is pleased to announce that it has been awarded a long-term production contract with the Aerospace Company of Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd. (“FHI”), a tier-one supplier to major original equipment manufacturers (“OEM”) of commercial and defence aircraft around the world. Avcorp will produce complex composite structural components for FHI that will be assembled for the Boeing 787 center wing box.  Avcorp, which will produce the components from its Composite Fabrication facility located in Gardena, California, expects that production volumes will grow by as much as 50% over historical supply rates. “The contract award with FHI is significant on a number of levels,” said Mr. Peter George, CEO of Avcorp Industries.  “First, it transitions our role with FHI from being a supplier with short-term purchase orders to one with a long-term contract for complex composite components for the Boeing 787 platform.  Second, it extends our reach within the Boeing supply chain by complementing our long-standing relationship with the OEM. Both developments are due to our growing reputation as a quality supplier and to the recent investments we have made towards developing expertise in the manufacture of complex composite materials.” As a result of the contract award, Avcorp’s order backlog is currently estimated at $901 million.  The new total reflects the cumulative net effect of recent production deliveries as well as the addition of production contract with FHI. About Avcorp The Avcorp Group designs and builds major airframe structures for some of the world’s leading aircraft companies, including BAE Systems, Boeing, Bombardier, FHI and Lockheed Martin.  The Avcorp Group has more than 50 years of experience, over 750 skilled employees and 636,000 square feet of facilities. Avcorp Structures & Integration located in Delta British Columbia, Canada is dedicated to metallic and composite aerostructures assembly and integration; Avcorp Engineered Composites located in Burlington Ontario, Canada is dedicated to design and manufacture of composite aerostructures, and Avcorp Composite Fabrication located in Gardena California, USA has advanced composite aerostructures fabrication capabilities for composite aerostructures. The Avcorp Group offers integrated composite and metallic aircraft structures to aircraft manufacturers, a distinct advantage in the pursuit of contracts for new aircraft designs, which require lower-cost, light‑weight, strong, reliable structures.  Comtek Advanced Structures Ltd., at our Burlington Ontario, Canada location also provides operators and MRO’s aircraft structural component repair services for commercial aircraft.  Avcorp Composite Fabrication Inc. is wholly owned by Avcorp US Holdings Inc.  Both companies are incorporated in The State of Delaware, USA, and are wholly owned subsidiaries of Avcorp Industries Inc.

John D. Simmons jsimmons@charlotteobserver.com i By Keith Bradsher New York Times LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story SHANGHAI As a candidate, Donald Trump aimed some of his most blistering words at China, declaring that “we already have a trade war” and suggesting ominously that “we have the power over China, economic power.” As president of the United States, Trump can use trade – a cornerstone of his populist rise – as a weapon, with the potential to drastically reshape the world’s two largest economies, as well as the companies, industries and workers who depend on their hundreds of billions of dollars in closely linked goods. But neither side may win. Cutting off trade will not bring back the bulk of U.S. manufacturing jobs lost to China in previous decades as it became the world’s factory floor. Already, some industries that left the United States years ago, such as garment making and some light manufacturing, are now leaving China for even cheaper places. An aggressive stance with China also risks antagonizing an authoritarian government with its own brand of economic nationalism. Yet the unsettling reality for Beijing is that Trump has a variety of ways to get back at China for trade practices that he, his supporters or people in the affected industries view as unfair. China sells a large array of goods to the United States that he can aim at for higher tariffs. The opportunities for China to retaliate would be more limited. In the most basic terms, China buys less from the United States. But China could make some strategic strikes at targets like Boeing, U.S. automakers and American farmers. Beijing exerts tight control over China’s airlines, for example, and sometimes steers contracts to Airbus, Boeing’s European rival, when officials feel that Washington is uncooperative. “Boeing complains, ‘We have been pretty good friends with China. Why are we always a target?’” said He Weiwen, a former Chinese commerce ministry official who is now the co-director of the China-U.S.-EU Study Center at the influential China Association of International Trade in Beijing. Or China could wreak havoc on the vast yet delicate supply chain behind a wide range of products like iPhones and auto parts. Six years ago, Chinese restrictions on exports of obscure yet vital minerals led to a global outcry by manufacturers. Early indications are that trade could take a more prominent place on the White House’s China agenda, which under President Barack Obama was dominated by Beijing’s territorial claims in East Asia and its influence over North Korea. In a strong signal, Trump has turned to Dan DiMicco, a longtime steel executive and trade critic, to oversee trade issues during his administration’s transition. DiMicco, former CEO of Charlotte-based Nucor, writes a personal blog, liberally sprinkled with exclamation points, that blames America’s industrial decline on cheating by trade partners, particularly China. “Hillary Clinton has claimed Trump’s trade policies will start a ‘Trade War’ but what she fails to recognize is we are already in one,” he wrote on his blog last summer. “Trump clearly sees it and he will work to put an end to China’s ‘Mercantilist Trade War’! A war it has been waging against us for nearly 2 decades!” On Thursday, Lu Kang, a spokesman for China’s Foreign Ministry, said, “It is in the common interests of both countries to develop a long-term, stable and prosperous trading relationship.” Trump’s views veer widely from the free-trade positions of the Republican Party in recent years and signal a return to the more hawkish positions of the Reagan administration, which repeatedly went after Japan on trade issues. Since President Ronald Reagan, Republican and Democratic administrations have been reluctant to confront countries that may be subsidizing or dumping exports, either because the evidence is unclear or because of a risk of damaging diplomatic or strategic relations. “This is the kind of stuff you learn in law school, and in the early days of your law career,” said Alan H. Price, a longtime lawyer for the American steel and aluminum industries at Wiley Rein. When used, the measures were sometimes deemed ineffective. In one rare example, Obama used his powers to impose tariffs of up to 35 percent on imports of Chinese tires soon after he took office. The tariffs prompted China to impose steep tariffs on U.S. chicken meat and automotive products. Both countries complained to the World Trade Organization, which mostly sided with the United States. The case resulted in the United States producing more tires, but imports from other countries rose even faster. And the Obama administration later became more cautious about challenging China with trade restrictions. Limits to trade actions Any trade actions by Trump would face limits. This year, he mentioned imposing a tariff of 45 percent on all imports from China. But he later avoided specifics – and he has limited power to do so anyway. The law allows him to impose tariffs of no more than 15 percent, and for as long as 150 days, on all imports, unless a national emergency is declared. Other laws allow him to impose tariffs on targeted goods. Should Trump want to signal an aggressive stance quickly, he could move against imports of steel and aluminum from China. The Obama administration has been preparing to file a World Trade Organization case against China over claims that it subsidized aluminum exports. And the United States, Japan and the European Union already complain that Chinese government subsidies have produced a bloated domestic steel industry that they say dumps millions of tons of excess goods on world markets each year. China is more vulnerable given the sheer amount of stuff it sells to America. For more than a decade, China has consistently exported about $4 worth of goods to the United States for each $1 of goods that it imports. Exports to the U.S. represent about 4 percent of the Chinese economy; U.S. exports to China are only about two-thirds of 1 percent of the U.S. economy. “We don’t have many things in the toolbox for retaliation, because we export more than we import,” said He, the former Chinese commerce ministry official. Still, China could inflict pain on sensitive areas that provide U.S. jobs, like Boeing’s jetliners. Boeing declined to comment except to say, “We congratulate President-elect Trump and newly elected members of Congress and look forward to working with them to make sure we continue to grow the global economy and protect our people.” General Motors and Ford Motor Co., consider China a big contributor to sales. They mostly manufacture in China to supply the domestic market. But much of the design and engineering work is still done in the United States. China could hurt the automakers by adopting domestic policies that help their big European rivals, notably Volkswagen and Mercedes-Benz. Other U.S. companies may be less opposed to trade limits than in the past. Some U.S. companies have been struggling to sell in China. Beijing has steered contracts to Chinese telecommunications companies after Edward Snowden’s revelations about U.S. intelligence gathering in China. And Chinese state-owned enterprises have shifted much of their investment banking business from Wall Street to homegrown rivals. U.S. farmers have welcomed Chinese purchases, but it is unclear how badly they could be hurt by any trade action. Chicken meat, soybeans, corn and other foodstuffs are commodities traded in world markets, and farmers are often able to sell elsewhere. Chinese goods have long helped keep prices down for Americans. But Chinese exports play a shrinking role in holding down prices as labor costs rise in China and as rivals like Indonesia, Vietnam and India expand manufacturing. China’s biggest potential weapon is to disrupt the supply chains of multinationals by halting exports of crucial materials or components. But that could damage China’s reputation as a reliable supplier. “I don’t think we will go that far at the moment, because there is a lot of room to negotiate,” He said. “If we are forced too much, nothing can be excluded.” Related content LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story Business Comments Videos facebook twitter email Share More Videos 3:16 HB2: A timeline for North Carolina’s controversial law Pause 3:42 Cliff Barrows - A Singing Faith 1:58 Artist group claims responsibility for body-shaped installation hanged from trees at Winthrop University 2:32 Trump names Priebus chief of staff, other top advisors await appointments 1:40 Cam Newton following 20-17 loss to Chiefs 2:52 Dan DiMicco is Trump trade adviser 1:14 Firefighters having 'difficulty' containing South Mountains State Park wildfire in NC 5:14 McCrory: 'We're going to check everything' 1:49 Trump and Clinton made a combined total of almost 30 visits to North Carolina since June but did voters care? 2:10 Steve Clifford at shootaround Share Video Video link: Select Embed code: Select facebook twitter email 11 days ago Jesse Cureton introduces community coalition effort 2:37 11 days ago Jesse Cureton introduces community coalition effort 1:29 14 days ago PGA Championship preview 2:26 18 days ago Tour of the new 300 South Tryon project View more video Business Charlotte’s DiMicco could be in line for job influencing U.S. trade policies Bank of America top exec sees Trump win boosting revenue, cutting costs Activist investor pushing break-up proposal at Bank of America again Bank of America still lags peers on customer service poll Duke Energy agrees to $27 million settlement of shareholder claims Editor's Choice Videos Subscriptions Digital Subscriptions Subscriber Services E-edition Newsletters RSS Feeds Site Information Customer Service About Us Contact Us Photo Store News in Education Published Corrections Social, Mobile & More Mobile & Apps Get News Apps Facebook Twitter YouTube Google+ Advertising Information Place a Classified Find&Save Local Shopping CLT Digital Copyright Privacy Policy Terms of Service Subscriptions Digital Subscriptions Subscriber Services E-edition Newsletters RSS Feeds Site Information Customer Service About Us Contact Us Photo Store News in Education Published Corrections Social, Mobile & More Mobile & Apps Get News Apps Facebook Twitter YouTube Google+ Advertising Information Place a Classified Find&Save Local Shopping CLT Digital More Copyright Privacy Policy Terms of Service

Resend activation e-mail Scientific Method / Science & Exploration As Trump takes over, NASA considers alternatives to its Orion spacecraft In October the space agency quietly solicited ideas from Boeing, SpaceX, and others. by Eric Berger - Nov 10, 2016 4:47 pm UTC Login to bookmark 138 This image shows an Orion parachute test. NASA NASA has initiated a process that raises questions about the future of its Orion spacecraft. So far, this procedural effort has flown largely under the radar, because it came in the form of a subtle Request for Information (RFI) that nominally seeks to extend NASA’s contract to acquire future Orion vehicles after Exploration Mission-2, which likely will fly sometime between 2021 and 2023. Nevertheless, three sources familiar with the RFI, who agreed to speak on the condition of anonymity, told Ars there is more to the request than a simple extension for Orion’s primary contractor, Lockheed Martin. Perhaps most radically, the RFI may even open the way for a competitor, such as Boeing or SpaceX, to substitute its own upgraded capsule for Orion in the mid-2020s. This RFI process, which originated in the Washington, DC-based office of the manager of NASA’s human spaceflight operations, Bill Gerstenmaier, appears to be an effort to keep the agency’s options open during a presidential transition. “This is NASA taking a breath and looking at alternatives,” one source told Ars. “Part of why they also did it is they are signaling to the next administration that they may be willing to look at alternatives.” Lockheed concerns In a heated competition a decade ago, Lockheed Martin won the initial contract to design and develop the deep-space Orion spacecraft, which was supposed to fly its first crewed mission in 2014. While the contractor has had to manage several significant change requests, there is nonetheless growing frustration with Lockheed inside NASA. The agency has spent nearly $10 billion so far on Orion, and although there was an uncrewed test flight in 2014, the first human mission won’t come for at least five more years. The new RFI states that Lockheed will continue with development of Orion through a second uncrewed flight set for late 2018 and Exploration Mission-2, the first crewed mission, as early as 2021. However, once this “base vehicle” configuration is established, the RFI signals NASA’s intent to find a less expensive path forward. “This RFI serves as an examination of the market, which is an initial step in pursuing any of the available acquisition strategies, including the exercising of existing options,” the document states. Unlike a more formal “Request for Proposals,” the RFI was written in a deliberately vague way, sources told Ars, in order to generate a wide variety of responses from industry. The most simple interpretation is that the RFI represents something of a “stalking horse” to drive down Lockheed’s bid to build subsequent Orions during the operational phase of the spacecraft, when NASA begins to fly crews into deep space, likely to a deep-space habitat. As part of this, the RFI anticipates moving from the existing cost-plus model to a fixed-price contract. "The NASA and Lockheed Martin team are approaching the end of Orion’s development phase having successfully tackled many of the toughest engineering challenges associated with deep space travel," Mike Hawes, Lockheed Martin's Orion Program Manager, said in a statement to Ars. "Now, as outlined in Lockheed Martin’s response to NASA’s RFI, we’ve identified savings that will reduce the recurring production costs of Orion by 50 percent – and we aren’t stopping there. We believe the cost savings we’ve defined in our response will enable decades of affordable human space exploration." The RFI clearly leaves the door open to other alternatives, however. The original structure of NASA’s contract with Lockheed Martin is such that NASA “owns” the design work when it is completed, so another contractor, if it could demonstrate a compelling cost advantage, could take over for Exploration Mission-3 and beyond. Enlarge / Bill Gerstenmaier, NASA's associate administrator for human exploration and operations, at the agency's headquarters in 2013. There are also hints of NASA expressing a willingness to consider other spacecraft to fulfill its needs in the 2020s and early 2030s, as it pushes crews into cislunar space, the area around the Moon. In contrast to a capsule designed for low-Earth orbit, a vehicle coming back from the Moon must have a more robust heat shield to tolerate higher temperatures during a return through the Earth’s atmosphere. Some members of Congress have quietly been asking NASA why it is now funding the development of three capsules. There is Orion for deep space, as well as Boeing’s Starliner and SpaceX’s Dragon for transport to the International Space Station in low-Earth orbit. It is possible one of these vehicles, or perhaps other concepts by companies such as Blue Origin or the Sierra Nevada Corporation, could be modified for a deep space return. “If a respondent wishes to provide a broader input beyond the topics described in this RFI or beyond the technical scope of the Orion spacecraft, then it is requested alternate responses be submitted separately,” the RFI states. It adds that these “alternate approaches” should include an analysis of their cost implications for NASA. Transition time The space agency posted the RFI in September and accepted responses through early October. NASA officials would not tell Ars how many companies responded. “This RFI was exploratory and intentionally open-ended and allowed industry the opportunity to provide feedback on a variety of areas, including interest in a potential future acquisition of Orion and perceived barriers to competition of Orion,” NASA spokeswoman Kathryn Hambleton told Ars. Sources said the timing coincided with the end of President Obama’s term in office, when NASA officials would begin meeting with transition team members of a new president. For the Trump administration the space effort is being led by Bob Walker, a former congressman, and Mark Albrecht, a long-time adviser to Republicans on space policy. Neither Walker nor Albrecht have been effusive in their praise of the Orion spacecraft or the Space Launch System rocket that will lift it into space. In October, during a forum at Rice University, Albrecht addressed the role transition teams play when a new president is preparing to take office. “The first thing a new administration will do is an independent review of the status of programs, and what they find will surprise no one,” Albrecht said. Inevitably, he added, an independent commission will discover an ever-growing NASA bureaucracy and underfunded, overambitious programs. Ars understands that there are also discussions in Gerstenmaier’s office about issuing a similar RFI for the Space Launch System rocket, which has Boeing as its primary contractor. This would not be too great of a surprise, because at least two companies, SpaceX and Blue Origin, are privately developing heavy-lift alternatives that theoretically could offer significant savings to the large government rocket. NASA would not confirm whether an RFI for the Space Launch System rocket will actually be issued, however. “Due to the sensitivity of the procurement process, NASA doesn’t comment on future procurement strategy,” Hambleton said. “Any future procurement activity will be worked through the standard process.” A replacement? Entering into the transition period between presidents, NASA’s administrator, Charles Bolden, has encouraged the next White House administration to continue support for Orion and the Space Launch System rocket, which account for more than $3 billion annually. Congress, too, has expressed a strong interest in continuing work on these vehicles. However one source told Ars that it may become necessary to choose either the Orion capsule or NASA rocket in the coming years as the space agency looks to pare back its budget, and this might necessitate going to a less expensive, more privately developed vehicle. “Look,” this source said, “if you have to cancel a program, this is a responsible way of lining up a replacement.” Without knowing the responses NASA received to the Orion RFI, it is not possible to know what options the agency—and the incoming Trump administration—will have when it comes to NASA’s flagship spacecraft and potentially its rocket. But what seems plain is that Gerstenmaier—a cautious, highly regarded engineer expected to remain at the agency after Bolden leaves along with the Obama administration—believes it prudent to offer incoming officials a suite of possibilities.

A businessman by profession, Donald Trump is one of the wealthiest and most influential individuals in the world. U.S. presidents through history have their private jets supplied by the government: the Air Force One. However, Trump may be the only president (or presidential candidate) that has a Boeing 757 turned private jet, and it is one of the most luxurious.  Advertisement The Trump Force One, or T-Bird as Trump would like to call it, has cost him an incredible $100 million, according to some reports. The newly elected president has owned this mean machine since 2011 and has turned it into a castle floating in the clouds.   One of the most impressive aspects of this plane is that it has a Rolls-Royce engine allowing it to achieve a striking 500 miles per hour, making it one of the fast Boeing airliners in the world. The interior is probably one of the most notable designs for any multi-passenger aircraft as the original 239-seater plane has been turned into a 430seater plane. All these seats are made from leather and could be transformed into beds. It boasts of its entertainment system which houses a video room with cinema, all of the latest technology.  It doesn't end there; it has a dining room, private guest rooms, and a bedroom. As the icing on the cake, there is a bath with 24-karat gold fixtures. This jet has accompanied Trump in his travels all over the U.S., making it one of the most iconic in the world. It has been the presidential candidate's home during his travels, a great percentage of his budget. It is believed to be one of Trump's instruments in making people believe that America can be rich once again.   Advertisement   TagsTrump, president, US Elections, luxury jet, trump force one © 2016 NatureWorldNews.com All rights reserved.

Lester Graham / Michigan Radio Listen Listening... / 4:26 Listen to Dave Groh talk to Lester Graham about vintage WWII airplanes. Credit Lester Graham / Michigan Radio World War II vintage planes are big attractions at air shows across the nation, but keeping them in the air means repairs and new parts. That’s where Dave Groh comes in. He operates Yesteryear Aviation Incorporated near Mason, Michigan. He rebuilds and makes parts for planes that were used to train pilots. He’s got one himself. Their mostly wood and canvas bi-planes. Why rebuild WWII trainers? “Because we love aviation,” he chuckled, adding, “and we like World War II aircraft in particular.” Groh says he’s owned some of these Boeing Stearman bi-planes.   He had to learn to rebuild them. Then other people wanted his help. The number of people who know these training planes is shrinking. A lot of the craftsmen were WWII veterans. There are a lot fewer of those guys still around. Groh pretty much does it all. He rebuilds the intricate wood and canvas wings, he manufactures parts, he even rebuilds the engines. A lot of those engines just happen to be Michigan made products. The old Boeing Stearman engine was made by Continental out of Muskegon. The steel forgings throughout the bi-plane were made by Atlas Drop Forge in Lansing. “A lot of the stuff was done here in this state. This airplane was built at the (Boeing) Wichita plant,” Groh explained. Dave Groh with a photo of his plane. The photo rests on a wing's wood skeleton. Credit Lester Graham / Michigan Radio There are about 2000 of these bi-planes still around. Groh says that many planes combined with so few people still around who can do the work ends up keeping his shop busy. “We manufacture a lot of parts under FAA approval for these airplanes,” Groh said. He makes about 95 parts for the bi-plane now and he needs to add to the list of parts he can produce. They also repair aluminum clad AT6 advanced trainers. Grant Dowell with Yesteryear Aviation was busy working on a wing after the plane had a mishap. “It went off the runway and ended up in a ditch and smacked the wing. It ended up doing some damage to the main spar here and some stringers,” Dowell said. Hundreds of rivets have to be drilled out to remove the aircraft’s metal skin. Then structural repairs or replacements are made.  After that, Dowell will rivet it all back together again,  making a 75 year old airplane look like it just came off the factory floor. Grant Dowell working on the wing of an AT6 advanced trainer. Credit Lester Graham / Michigan Radio Both Dowell and Dave Groh are pilots. Groh said there was a point he had to make a decision, fly for one of the airlines or rebuild these WWII vintage planes. “I would have had a better paycheck in the end, but I don’t think I would have been as happy as working here. Plus, I get a lot of family time. Money isn’t everything,” Groh said, smiling. Support for arts and culture coverage comes in part from the Michigan Council for Arts and Cultural Affairs.

After winning the election, Trump broke tradition by taking his own Boeing 757 jet to a meeting with the outgoing president Barack Obama to discuss the transition period. Having acquired the jet in 2011, Trump has spent a small fortune of about $100m customizing the aircraft to his liking with the latest technology and finest decor. Trump is set for the White House in January 2017 and he would have to give up his luxurious jet for the Air Force One, which is owned by the US military and equipped with special security features to protect the commander in chief while in flight. READ ALSO: 11 facts about Donald Trump’s presidential armored car Below are some amazing features of the jet which he affectionately calls ‘the T-Bird’ 1. Powered by Rolls Royce engines The Boeing 757 is powered by a pair of Rolls-Royce RB211 turbofan engines. Trump was very keen to have this feature on his plane. It is incredibly powerful, although it is not the most fuel-efficient engine in the world. The plane has Rolls Royce engine 2. 24-karat-gold fixtures The seat belts, master bath, taps in the bathroom are 24-carat gold plated. Virtually every fixture in the plane is 24-karat-gold plated. 3. The bedroom Trump has an elegant silk-lined master bedroom equipped with a big-screen entertainment system. The pillows are embroidered with his family crest. There’s also a private guest room with another entertainment system. 4. The seats The seats on the jet have personal entertainment systems and convert into beds. The headrests and pillows are embroidered with the Trump family crest. READ ALSO: Michelle Obama and Melania Trump meet for the first time 5. The video lounge There is a 57-inch screen TV and sound system – installed video room with cinema system similar to a ‘top Hollywood screening room’  with access to 1,000 movies. 6. Other features Everything is controlled by touch screen even access to “The Donald’s” DVR. Trump’s jet can carry only 43 passengers. The Boeing is outfitted with a modern glass cockpit. What you should know. Trump was not the jet’s first owner. Boeing 757-2J4ER first flew in May 1991. In 1995, it was bought by Microsoft cofounder Paul Allen and served as a corporate runabout for his various interests. In 2011, it took the place of Trump’s former plane, a Boeing 727 built in 1969. See how Trump is being whisked around in complete luxury. Anybody that says money is not good is such a LIAR!

Iran News ... 11/11/16 GOP in new push against Iran-Boeing deal Source: Press TV Shortly after the victory of Donald Trump as the president-elect of the United States, an early indication has appeared to show that the Republicans are already gearing up to undo the achievements of the outgoing President Barack Obama in his approach toward Iran. The US House Rules Committee announced on Thursday that it is preparing to debate legislation that aims to block US financing for sale of $25 billion worth of planes to Iran by American aviation giant Boeing.  Frontpage of Iranian daily Monaghese The bill from Rep. Bill Huizenga, R-Mich., would prohibit US banks from financing the plane sale and would revoke any Treasury Department approval of the sale granted before the legislation is approved, reported The USA Today. The bill would "prohibit the secretary of the Treasury from authorizing certain transactions by a US financial institution in connection with the export or re-export of a commercial passenger aircraft to the Islamic Republic of Iran." Boeing received a Treasury license to sell 80 planes to Iran, under a memo signed in June. Yet, it is still negotiating with Iran for selling the planes to the country's national airline Iran Air. Boeing's European rival Airbus also announced in September that it had received Treasury Department's approval to sell planes to Iran. President Obama could veto the legislation if Congress sends it to him. But the bill represents the latest salvo from lawmakers opposed to the nuclear deal negotiated with Iran, which President-elect Donald Trump has criticized and said he would overturn, added The USA Today. The House Rules Committee would meet Monday to set the terms for how the bill is debated on the House floor. Even if approved in the House, it is unclear whether the legislation could clear the Senate during the lame-duck session of Congress, it added. Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., told The USA Today that he "strongly opposed" the bill, warning that it could undermine the nuclear agreement with Iran. But Rep. Brad Sherman, D-Calif., who supported the bill, said it didn't violate the agreement. He suggested that Iran could default on loan payments to US banks. "Let's not expose American depositors and banks to the risk that they will not be paid tens of billions of dollars by Iran," Sherman said. ...

At Shadetree airstrip in Lyman, they keep three airplanes manufactured in the 1940s, used to train World War II pilots and still flying today. Danny Miller, who owns the airfield, says there’s nothing like owning one of these historic aircraft. Miller has the first plane aspiring Army and Navy pilots climbed into, a primary trainer known as the Boeing Stearman. When he flies the plane, Miller thinks about the young cadets who climbed into it for the first time to earn their wings and fight for their country. The airplane is basic. With an open cockpit, low horsepower, fixed landing gear and no radio. “It’s needle, ball and air speed,” brother Jimmy Miller explained: The ball tells you if you’re flying true, the needle if you’re turning and the air speed how fast you’re going.” Danny Miller bought the plane six years ago from an owner in Dover, Delaware, who flew it down. The Millers say about 13,000 were manufactured, with only 1,000 still around. Jimmy Miller has an even rarer bird, a Vultee BT-13, the basic trainer pilots graduated to after they mastered the Stearman. “There’s fewer than 40 flying, and I got one,” he said. “I shopped four, five years until I found the one I wanted and then I went to California and flew it home.” That was a little more than a month ago. He ran into some bad weather on the trip. “It took me five days to get it home,” Jimmy Miller said. “The airplane performed flawlessly. I flew a 1944 airplane from Monterey, California, to Gulfport Mississippi. There’s a small group of people in that club, and I’m one of them.” In the Vultee, pilots learned radio communications and navigation with instruments. They also flew faster because the Vultee engine has double the horsepower of the Stearman. The third training aircraft housed at Shadetree, an AT-6, an advanced trainer manufactured by North American, is owned by a Kiln resident. It is currently in Jackson for repairs, but also is air worthy. Boeing describes the plane as transitioning World War II pilots from trainers to “first-line, tactical aircraft.” The brothers take their planes to air shows in the region, but mostly, they enjoy giving friends and admirers rides in the unique aircraft. Flying in the World War II trainers is a one-of-a-kind experience. Both brothers graciously gave this nervous Sun Herald reporter rides on a sunny Thursday afternoon. First, the Stearman. What a beautiful flight in an open, double cockpit. It wasn’t loud at all because of the 220-horsepower engine, or even overly windy with its compact windshield. The sprawling subdivisions, lakes and piney woods of South Mississippi unfolded as the plane climbed to 500 feet. Danny Miller executed a hard left turn, advising his novice passenger up front before undertaking any maneuver. “We’re going to go low and fast,” he said, checking for obstructions on the runway. And then he nodded toward the Vultee far below: “You’ve got to ride in that beast,” he said. Really? OK. The Vultee was louder, a glass dome covering the double cockpit. It rattled, too. Pilots called it the Vultee Vibrator. Both landings were like touching down in butter instead of on a grass airstrip. Way to go, Millers. Thanks for unforgettable flights in these working pieces of American history.

PetroTalk Infogram Docs فارسی French فارسی French GOP in new push against Iran-Boeing deal Fri Nov 11, 2016 8:4AM Home Iran Economy The US House of Representatives has approved a Republican bill to block US financing for sale of $25 billion worth of planes to Iran by Boeing. Shortly after the victory of Donald Trump as the president-elect of the United States, an early indication has appeared to show that the Republicans are already gearing up to undo the achievements of the outgoing President Barack Obama in his approach toward Iran. The US House Rules Committee announced on Thursday that it is preparing to debate legislation that aims to block US financing for sale of $25 billion worth of planes to Iran by American aviation giant Boeing.  The bill from Rep. Bill Huizenga, R-Mich., would prohibit US banks from financing the plane sale and would revoke any Treasury Department approval of the sale granted before the legislation is approved, reported The USA Today. The bill would "prohibit the secretary of the Treasury from authorizing certain transactions by a US financial institution in connection with the export or re-export of a commercial passenger aircraft to the Islamic Republic of Iran." Boeing received a Treasury license to sell 80 planes to Iran, under a memo signed in June. Yet, it is still negotiating with Iran for selling the planes to the country’s national airline Iran Air. Boeing’s European rival Airbus also announced in September that it had received Treasury Department’s approval to sell planes to Iran. President Obama could veto the legislation if Congress sends it to him. But the bill represents the latest salvo from lawmakers opposed to the nuclear deal negotiated with Iran, which President-elect Donald Trump has criticized and said he would overturn, added The USA Today. The House Rules Committee would meet Monday to set the terms for how the bill is debated on the House floor. Even if approved in the House, it is unclear whether the legislation could clear the Senate during the lame-duck session of Congress, it added. Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., told The USA Today that he "strongly opposed" the bill, warning that it could undermine the nuclear agreement with Iran. But Rep. Brad Sherman, D-Calif., who supported the bill, said it didn't violate the agreement. He suggested that Iran could default on loan payments to US banks. "Let's not expose American depositors and banks to the risk that they will not be paid tens of billions of dollars by Iran," Sherman said. Loading ...

Tracey Curtis-Taylor was celebrated for completing a solo flight from Cape Town, South Africa, to Goodwood in 2013. The flight was organised to retrace Lady Mary Heath’s 1928 journey – flying in a classic 1940s open cockpit Boeing Stearman biplane. As a result of the trip, the 54-year-old was presented the prestigious Bill Woodhams trophy awarded for navigation by the Light Aircraft Association. But members of the aviation body decided to rescind the title at their latest annual general meeting after it was claimed the pilot flew only a handful of the 36 legs alone. Ms Curtis-Taylor denied her own trip was ever planned as lone voyage – despite an official press release by supporters Boeing at the time, which described it as a ‘solo journey’. She said she had intended to make the journey in the biplane flying solo, but denied claims she had made ‘false assertions’ about the trip. In a statement, Ms Curtis-Taylor explained several people had flown with her on multiple legs between Cape Town and the UK, including her engineer Ewald Gritsch. But she added: ‘I have never made false assertions about the nature of my flights and I dismiss the suggestion that they are “mired in controversy”. ‘A combination of elements resulted in fundamental changes being made to the nature of that expedition.’ The controversy comes amid calls to strip the famed pilot of other honorary titles presented to her in Portsmouth. Last year, Ms Curtis-Taylor was awarded the rank of Lieutenant Commander in the maritime reserve. And in July this year, she received an honorary doctorate from the University of Portsmouth for her adventuring. Her defiance has infuriated the father of a serving Royal Navy officer, based at HMS Collingwood, who said she should be stripped of her rank and all her titles. Mike Flynn, a former BBC reporter and pilot, said: ‘She’s embellished this great aviatrix story which just is not true. She’s fooled everybody.’ Back to the top of the page Sign in {* #userInformationForm *} Sign in socially {* loginWidget *} with your email address {* traditionalSignIn_emailAddress *} {* traditionalSignIn_password *} {* traditionalSignIn_signInButton *} Forgot your password?

Follow @NASASpaceFlight Home Forums L2 Sign Up ISS Commercial Shuttle SLS/Orion Russian European Chinese Unmanned Other Atlas V launches WorldView-4 out of Vandenberg November 10, 2016 by William Graham The United Launch Alliance (ULA) Atlas V rocket – interrupted by a wildfire – finally conducted a rare commercial launch on Friday, tasked with orbiting the WorldView-4 Earth-imaging satellite in a mission from Vandenberg Air Force Base, California. The launch was set to take place in September, prior to the standdown. Atlas V Launch: The launch of WorldView-4 was the tenth commercial launch for the Atlas V rocket, although six of those launches were made more than ten years ago before the rocket was established as a workhorse for United States government customers. The initial launch attempt back in September was proceeding to the final minutes of the countdown, prior to a decision to standdown due to a small ground side LH2 leak resulting in an ice ball forming on an umbilical. ULA CEO Tory Bruno noted this was outside of ULA’s historic experience, thus resulting in a scrub – for at least 24 hours – to resolve. Later, a ULA source noted the next attempt would be 48 hours after the scrub in order to allow time to replace a Fill and Drain (F&D) valve that was deemed to be the problem during first attempt. However, that Sunday’s attempt was called off early in the morning due to brush fires in the region. Those fires became a much larger problem during the days that followed, with large wildfires ravaging the area. They reached within eye shot of the pad. However, responders ably managed to keep the launch site safe, with Atlas V protected inside the launch tower. WorldView-4 was the second satellite to be launched by the Atlas V for its operator, DigitalGlobe, following WorldView-3 in August 2014. See Also UPDATES Atlas V WV-4 ULA Forum Section 65 Launch Vehicle Manuals (L2) Click here to Join L2 WorldView-4 was originally constructed for GeoEye Incorporated as GeoEye-2. Lockheed Martin was awarded a contract to build the satellite in March 2010, followed in October of the same year by a contract to provide launch services. Lockheed Martin developed the Atlas V rocket. However, in 2006 it transferred the rocket to the newly-formed United Launch Alliance (ULA), a jointly-owned venture with Boeing who transferred their Delta II and Delta IV vehicles to the company. Under this agreement, Lockheed Martin still markets the rocket to commercial customers, subcontracting the launch to ULA. GeoEye merged with DigitalGlobe in January 2013, four months ahead of the planned launch of GeoEye-2. With DigitalGlobe’s own WorldView-3 scheduled to fly the following year, the company decided that launching both satellites in such a short timespan was unnecessary and opted to keep GeoEye-2 as a ground spare until needed in orbit. A year later DigitalGlobe announced that due to market demand they were considering moving the launch up and that the spacecraft had been renamed WorldView-4; in late 2015 the launch was set for September 2016. DigitalGlobe itself was formed in January 1992 as WorldView Imaging, and from 1995 to 2001 the company was named EarthWatch, before taking on its current name. The company’s first satellite, EarlyBird 1, was launched by a Start-1 rocket in December 1997. However, the spacecraft failed three days after launch. A second satellite, Quickbird-1, was lost in a Kosmos-3M launch failure in November 2000, before Quickbird-2 successfully reached orbit atop a Delta II the following October, achieving thirteen and a quarter years of service before its retirement in January 2015. Today, the company has four satellites in service: WorldView-1 was launched atop a Delta II 7920-10C from Vandenberg in September 2007 and was designed for a minimum of seven and a half years’ service which it has already exceeded. WorldView-2 followed atop another Delta II in October 2009, with WorldView-3 launching on an Atlas V in August 2014. The fourth satellite is GeoEye-1, inherited in the merger with GeoEye, which was launched by a Delta II 7420-10C in September 2008. Although GeoEye-1 has already surpassed its seven-year design life, it carries sufficient fuel for fifteen years of service. WorldView-4 is a 2,087-kilogram (4,601 lb) satellite, based on Lockheed Martin’s LM-900 bus and LMx avionics package. The LM-900 bus has only previously been used for two satellites: a pair of Ikonos imaging satellites operated by one of GeoEye’s predecessors – Space Imaging – which were launched by Athena-2 rockets in 1999. The first failed to achieve orbit. However, the second – Ikonos-1 – remained in service for fifteen and a half years. It was transferred to GeoEye when the company was formed in the 2006 merger of Space Imaging and the Orbital Imaging Corporation, or OrbImage, and was still operational when transferred to DigitalGlobe in the 2013 merger – finally being decommissioned in March 2015. In the eighteen years since its last launch, Lockheed Martin has improved on the LM-900 bus, incorporating the same avionics package used in planetary missions including the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, Juno and GRAIL. Lockheed Martin has also upgraded its LM-1200 bus, jointly designating the two platforms with improved avionics as the LMx series. WorldView-4’s GIS-2 imaging systems were developed by Harris Corporation and are capable of panchromatic or multispectral observations over a 13.1-kilometre (8.1 mile, 7.1 nautical mile) swath width. Panchromatic imaging will capture light at wavelengths between 450 and 800 nanometres, with a resolution of up to 31 centimeters (12.2 inches). In multispectral operation the satellite can sample a blue band of wavelengths between 450 and 510 nanometres, green between 510 and 580 nm, red between 655 and 690 nm and infrared between 780 and 920 nanometres. The satellite’s maximum multispectral resolution is 1.24 meters. The WorldView-4 satellite has a design life of seven years; however it is expected to exceed this with ten to twelve years of service envisioned. The satellite will be operated in a sun-synchronous orbit at an altitude of 617 kilometers (383 miles, 333 nautical miles). The Atlas V that launched WorldView-4, AV-062, was an Atlas V 401. The smallest Atlas V configuration, it consists of a Common Core Booster (CCB) first stage and a single-engine Centaur second stage with a four-metre payload fairing and no solid-fuelled booster rockets. AV-062 was originally intended to launch NASA’s InSight mission to Mars in March, however efforts to repair a leak in the InSight spacecraft’s primary instrument could not be completed in time to make its 27-day launch window, necessitating a delay to 2018, the next time Earth and Mars will be aligned to facilitate placing the spacecraft into a suitable transfer orbit between the two planets. Assembly of the Atlas V for the InSight mission was already underway, so the vehicle was kept integrated atop its launch pad in preparation for the next mission, WorldView, which was to use the same 401 configuration. WorldView-4 was launched from Space Launch Complex 3E (SLC-3E) at the Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. Part of a two-pad complex that was originally built as Launch Complex 1 of the US Navy’s Point Arguello facility, the pad became part of the adjacent Vandenberg Air Force Base when the sites were merged in 1964 and was subsequently renamed SLC-3E in 1967 with the complex’s other pad becoming SLC-3W. The first launch from SLC-3E – then still part of Point Arguello – was made by an Atlas LV-3 Agena-B on 12 July 1961, the first of several Atlas-Agenas to launch from the pad. After the Atlas-Agena the complex was used by three Atlas SLV-3 vehicles which made suborbital launches with the PRIME lifting body in 1966 and 1967, followed in 1968 by a single launch of a leftover Atlas SLV-3 with a Burner II upper stage which failed to achieve orbit. After this launch, the pad remained inactive for ten years. Beginning in 1978, SLC-3E began to be used by the Atlas E/F rocket, based on the Atlas-E and Atlas-F missiles, to launch early Global Positioning System (GPS) satellites; followed by Atlas-H launches with first-generation Intruder ocean surveillance satellites for the National Reconnaissance Office. The pad again became inactive following the final Atlas-H launch in May 1987. However, in the 1990s it was rebuilt for the Atlas II. Three Atlas II vehicles launched from Vandenberg; the first carrying NASA’s Terra Earth observation satellite with two subsequent launches deploying third-generation Intruder satellites for the NRO. The Atlas V was not originally expected to launch from Vandenberg; due to the relatively limited subset of Government missions requiring a West Coast launch only the Delta IV was to have facilities there. This changed after Boeing were stripped of several launch contracts following a corporate espionage case, and the former Atlas II pad was adapted for the larger Atlas V. AV-062 will be the twelfth Atlas V to fly from SLC-3E. The second pad at Space Launch Complex 3, SLC-3W, is no longer in use. It supported its last launch in March 1995 with the retirement of the Atlas E/F and despite conversion by SpaceX to launch Falcon 1 rockets in the mid-2000s, the pad was never used again for a launch. The Falcon launch facilities at SLC-3W have since been dismantled. Launch of the Atlas V rocket with WorldView-4 began with ignition of the rocket’s RD-180 engine 2.7 seconds before the countdown reached zero. Developed by Russian manufacturer NPO Energomash, the RD-180 is derived from the RD-170 series of engine developed for the Zenit rocket and burns RP-1 propellant mixed with liquid oxygen within twin combustion chambers. A single RD-180 powers the Atlas V first stage, or Common Core Booster (CCB). Liftoff of AV-062 occurred when the thrust from the RD-180 engine exceeded the weight of the rocket; which occurred 1.1 seconds after the zero mark in the countdown. Atlas began its ascent, making a series of pitch and yaw maneuvers beginning seventeen and a half seconds after launch to place itself on the pre-planned launch trajectory. The rocket flew south from Vandenberg along an azimuth of 185.6 degrees over the Pacific Ocean. At 79.1 seconds into the flight the vehicle passed through Mach 1, the speed of sound, followed by the area of maximum dynamic pressure, or Max-Q, 13.4 seconds later. Four minutes and 3.1 seconds after liftoff, the Common Core Booster cut off, having completed its role in the mission. The spent stage separated six seconds later, with the second stage engine beginning its prestart sequence. The second stage, Centaur, is powered by a single RL10C-1 engine which burns cryogenic propellant; liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen. Centaur ignition occurred ten seconds after stage separation. Prior to the deployment of WorldView-4, Centaur made a single burn lasting eleven minutes and 15.9 seconds. At the start of the burn, 8.1 seconds after ignition, the rocket’s payload fairing separated from around the WorldView spacecraft. For this mission a Long Payload Fairing (LPF), the shortest of the three four-metre fairings available, was used to encapsulate the satellite. Separation of WorldView-4 is occurred at nineteen minutes and 15.9 seconds mission elapsed time; three minutes and 39 seconds after the end of powered flight. The target deployment orbit is 610.46 by 628.29 kilometers (379.31 by 390.40 miles, 329.62 by 339.25 nautical miles) at an inclination of 97.96 degrees to Earth’s equator. Centaur’s mission did not end with the separation of WorldView-4. During its second revolution around the Earth, seven smaller satellites were deployed under a mission designated Enterprise, which is sponsored by the National Reconnaissance Office. All of the secondary payloads conform the CubeSat standard. AeroCube-8C and 8D are 1.5-unit CubeSats which form part of The Aerospace Corporation’s IMPACT mission, carrying technology demonstration experiments that include a new form of ion propulsion, materials research involving the use of carbon nanotubes for radiation shielding, and studies of the performance of solar cells. AeroCube-8C and 8D follow the AeroCube-8A and 8B satellites launched as secondary payloads to the X-37B spaceplane last May as part of the AFSPC-5 launch. The US Air Force Research Laboratory’s CELTEE satellite is a single-unit CubeSat which will be used to evaluate the on-orbit performance of an Enhanced Location Transponder (ELT) developed by M42 Technologies of Seattle, Washington. The one-kilogram (2.2 lb) satellite is expected to operate for three to six months while researchers on the ground track the satellite to determine how well the transponder serves its purpose. The AFRL’s second CubeSat aboard the mission is named Untitled 2U, or U2U, and is a two-unit CubeSat which will carry out an experiment named Electron and Globalstar Mapping – presumably indicating that its research will involve the Globalstar communication satellite network. Preliminary results from the U2U mission are scheduled to be presented at a December conference of the American Geophysical Union. Two 1.5-unit Prometheus satellites, developed by the Los Alamos National Laboratory, form part of an experiment into using small satellites to relay video, voice and data communications between field terminals and ground stations. Prometheus 2A and 2B are the first members of a second-generation Prometheus constellation, building on research conducted by the eight-satellite first-generation constellation which launched aboard a Minotaur I rocket in 2013 as part of the ORS-3 mission. Further second-generation spacecraft will be launched as secondary payloads on the maiden flight of SpaceX’s Falcon Heavy rocket, currently scheduled for next year. The final secondary payload, Radiometer Assessment Using Vertically Aligned Nanotubes – or RAVAN – is a three-unit CubeSat built by Blue Canyon Technologies for operation by the Applied Physics Laboratory at Johns Hopkins University. Designed for a six-month mission, the five-kilogram (11-lb) satellite will use highly light-absorbent carbon nanotubes to collect as much of the radiation emitted and reflected by the Earth as possible across the whole electromagnetic spectrum. A radiometer will be used to measure the total radiation output of the Earth, which scientists will compare to the energy input from the sun to study the imbalance between incident and outgoing radiation – or the amount of energy retained by the Earth. The CubeSats separated from Centaur in four groups, between two hours, eleven minutes and 45.9 seconds and two hours, twenty-five minutes and 45.9 seconds mission elapsed time. After all seven CubeSats deployed, the Centaur is likely to fire its RL10 engine again in a disposal burn, taking itself away from the operational orbits of its spacecraft. The final destination of the Centaur from the launch is expected to be heliocentric orbit, with the disposal burn propelling it to Earth escape trajectory. The launch was the sixth of the year for the Atlas V rocket, following on from the successful deployment of the OSIRIS-Rex spacecraft bound for asteroid (101955) Bennu, which flew from Cape Canaveral atop an Atlas V 411. It was the ninth launch of 2016 for United Launch Alliance, who have also launched three Delta IV vehicles. An Atlas V launch had been scheduled for early October with the SBIRS-GEO-3 missile detection satellite. However, this mission has been delayed due to apparent concerns that the satellite uses a similar component to one that had recently failed on another satellite. Details of the component and other satellite in question were not given, other than the satellite was not built by Lockheed Martin – the manufacturer of the SBIRS-GEO spacecraft. The concerns likely refer to the Intelsat 33e satellite whose apogee motor failed after launching on an Ariane 5 earlier this year. Beyond SBIRS-GEO-3, ULA’s plans for the remainder of 2016 currently an Atlas V mission with NOAA’s GOES-R satellite later this month November, potentially followed by two launches in December with NROL-79 for the National Reconnaissance Office and the commercial EchoStar XIX communications satellite. A Delta IV launch will carry the eighth Wideband Global Satcom spacecraft for the US Air Force before the year is out. (Images via ULA, WorldView, Lockheed Martin).

This makes Emirates the first and only airline in the world to operate a fleet of all Airbus A380 and Boeing 777 aircraft for its passenger flights. Emirates operates an all-A380 New Zealand service with five double-decker flights a day to Dubai and beyond - four from Auckland and one from Christchurch. Emirates recently retired the last of the 29 Airbus A330 aircraft that had been operating as part of its fleet. Aircraft A6-EAK joined Emirates in 2002 and had flown for over 60,000 hours, travelling close to 45 million kilometres in 14.5 years. That distance is equivalent to almost 60 return journeys between the Earth and the Moon. Emirates has also phased out A6-ERN, the last serving Airbus A340 in the fleet, which had joined the airline in 2004 and was originally manufactured in 1999. Since January 2015, Emirates has retired 18 A330 and five A340 aircraft from its fleet. The average age of the Airbus A330 and A340 aircraft phased out from the fleet is 16.5 years- a figure which is well below the industry standard retirement age of 25 years. In addition to the aircraft that have been retired from active service since January 2015, Emirates plans to further phase out some 25 aircraft over the course of 2017 and 2018 to ensure that the operating fleet remains modern and efficient while offering customers a higher level of comfort and safety. The retirement of older aircraft is balanced by the induction of younger, more modern aircraft into the fleet. This has resulted in Emirates operating one of the youngest fleets in the industry with an average age of 5.2 years. The two youngest aircraft in the fleet- Emirates’ 85th A380, the first of the new generation A380 aircraft delivered in October 2016, and Emirates’ 125th Boeing 777-300ER- are less than two weeks old. Emirates’ fleet of all Airbus A380 and Boeing 777 aircraft will also have a smaller environmental impact as both aircraft types have better fuel efficiency and emissions performance than the retired aircraft. For the calendar year 2016 Emirates will have taken delivery of 36 new aircraft - 20 Airbus A380s and 16 Boeing 777s. This also includes the next generation Boeing 777-300ER aircraft - with upgraded business class seats and other features including a lower fuel burn ratio - to be delivered from November 2016. Emirates is currently the largest operator of the Airbus A380 and Boeing 777 aircraft with 85 Airbus A380s and 160 Boeing 777s in its fleet. Out of the 234 aircraft worth over US$112 billion that Emirates has in its order book, 150 will be the new Boeing 777X aircraft that will be delivered starting 2020. The aircraft will feature a range of passenger focused amenities on board including larger windows, higher ceiling, and a wider cabin in addition to being more fuel efficient than older aircraft.

perks News provided by Alaska Airlines Nov 10, 2016, 14:30 ET Share this article SEATTLE, Nov. 10, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Starting today Alaska Airlines fliers who want a little more legroom will have the option to purchase seats with up to four more inches of space between rows. The airline will debut its Premium Class section for travel on select routes beginning Jan. 5, 2017, as it continues a significant retrofit of its all-Boeing fleet. In addition to four extra inches of legroom, passengers seated in Premium Class will enjoy early boarding, snacks and complimentary drinks. Alaska Mileage Plan MVP, Gold and Gold 75K members will be eligible for complimentary upgrades into Premium Class at the time of booking, or up to 24 hours in advance of travel, depending on status and the fare purchased.  Continue Reading Alaska Airlines Premium Class on sale today With the addition of Premium Class, Alaska's most loyal customers who aren't able to upgrade into First Class will see a significantly increased likelihood of getting a seat with more legroom near the front of the cabin. "Premium Class is the most recent example of the on-going investment we are making to enhance the customer experience on our airplanes," said Andrew Harrison, executive vice president and chief commercial officer at Alaska Airlines. "We will continue to reward our loyal customers by offering one of the most generous upgrade policies in the industry with an average of 60 percent of the First Class cabin being occupied by upgraded elites." For more information around upgrades for elites see the Alaska Airlines blog: Treat yourself: Alaska Airlines launches new Premium Class Initial prices for Premium Class seats range from $15 to $79 in addition to base fares and are based on the length of the flight. Seats in the new section can be purchased at the time of booking through alaskaair.com or Alaska's mobile apps, during check-in, and at the airport. Premium Class seats are located in the front portion of the main cabin, allowing for faster boarding and deplaning. The new section offers an additional four inches of legroom, with 35 inches of space between rows, compared to the 31 to 32 inches between rows in the rest of the main cabin.  "As a businessman who flies at least 75,000 miles every year, the extra room allowed me to work more comfortably with my laptop and is almost like having a mini office in the air," said Frank Albano, an Alaska frequent flier who has logged more than a million miles and was recently seated in the new section on one of the reconfigured planes. First Class cabin enhancements The aircraft retrofits will also result in significantly expanded legroom in the First Class cabin, which will increase from 36 to 41 or 42 inches, and will be among the most spacious First Class cabins domestically. In addition to the increased legroom, First Class customers will continue to enjoy a seat that is four inches wider, free inflight entertainment tablets, a complimentary selection of fine wines and spirits, and chef-inspired, locally-sourced snacks and meals. It is expected that nearly half of the fleet will feature Premium Class by the end by the end of 2016, with the balance of planes being reconfigured in 2017. A decision on when the 737-700s will be retrofitted will be announced mid-2017. Alaska will retire its fleet of 737-400s in 2017. The upgrade option will also be available on the Embraer 175s operated by SkyWest Airlines and soon, Horizon Air. Plane Type Fleet count* Current Cabin (First Class/ Main Cabin) Reconfigured Cabin (First Class/Premium Class/Main Cabin) 737-800 61 16/147 12/30/117 737-900/900ER 77 16/165 16/24/138 737-700 11 12/112 More detail to come in 2017 E175 15 12/64 12/12/52 Premium Class is replacing Preferred Plus, which was only available in exit rows and bulkhead seats.

Coming Thursday: the 2016 Defense One Summit, Nov. 17 in DC Yes, Big Data Did Triumph on Election Day White House: $11.6B More Needed for ISIS Fight, Afghanistan Will Trump Keep Obama’s Top Mideast General? Global Business Brief: Trump looks good for defense business; New faces at the Pentagon Sponsor Content How Cloud Will Affect the Future of Policing Defense One Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Email → News Threats Politics Business Tech Ideas Trump looks good for defense business; New faces at the Pentagon; Want to buy an Army Humvee? By Marcus Weisgerber Read bio November 10, 2016 Topics The Global Business Brief Industry 2016 AA Font size + Print Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Email this article By Marcus Weisgerber Read bio November 10, 2016 Last year, Byron Callan was among the first to seriously examine what a President Trump would mean for Wall Street and the investment community. The Capital Alpha analyst opened his Dec. 13, 2015, note like this: “We don’t expect Donald Trump will be the next President. However we have some thoughts regarding defense if we are wrong.” The gist: we don’t know much about Trump’s defense plan other than some broad themes. A year later, we still don’t know the specifics, but it appears that defense spending could be one of this election’s biggest winners. Companies had been expecting a boost no matter who won; the question was how much. Now with a Republican heading to the White House in January and the GOP keeping control of both chambers of Congress, the consensus appears “higher than expected,” even though Trump has not yet laid out detailed detailed defense plans. “Overall we believe the outcome of the recent election will bolster what was already an improving demand environment for defense contractors, despite some uncertainties about spending levels and priorities,” said Christopher Denicolo, a credit analyst with S&P Global. Subscribe Get The Global Business Brief in your inbox: The must-read news, analysis and insights about the intersection of business and international security. The other big factor: The Budget Control Act — sometimes called sequestration — which caps federal spending. The BCA runs through 2021 and lawmakers must find a way to repeal it in order to spend more on defense. The other option is to pay use the war budget — know as Overseas Contingency Operations — to fund the increases. Where to watch. Defense stocks have performed well in recent years despite a slide in defense spending. They have cut jobs and factories to reduce overhead from less government work. Many have also looked for business overseas. Campaign donations from employees of defense firms ran 2-to-1 for Hillary Clinton. But in the wake of Trump’s upset victory, defense executives expressed a high level of optimism they they would see more Pentagon business heading their way. How will defense firms react? Keep an eye on key personnel in the government relations divisions of large defense firms, aka their internal lobbying shops. Lockheed Martin seems well positioned here with Robert Rangel — chief of staff to former Defense Secretaries Donald Rumsfeld and Robert Gates — leading its Washington operations. What sectors might see more investment? Aside from what’s been broadly mentioned by Trump — ships, aircraft and missile defense — we could look to the woman leading his Pentagon transition team for some clues. Mira Ricardel is a former Boeing executive and former acting assistant secretary of Defense for International Security Policy in the George W. Bush administration. Tony Bertuca over at Inside Defense confirmed her Trump assignment this week. She’s working for Keith Kellogg, a retired Army lieutenant general who is in charge of the defense transition writ large, including the Defense and Veterans Affairs departments. In recent years, Ricardel has called for satellites to track missiles launched by rogue states and lasers to blast those rockets from the sky. At an August conference in Alabama, the head of the Pentagon’s Missile Defense agency talked about those two subjects, lasers and tracking satellites. Since Ricardel worked in Boeing’s Strategic Missile & Defense Systems, that could bode well for the Pentagon’s nuclear-weapons overhaul. While the Air Force’s new B-21 stealth bomber and Navy’s Columbia-class missile submarine appear to have backing inside the Pentagon and on Capitol Hill, the wildcard has been the prospect of a new ICBM. Ricardel’s background suggests more emphasis on the effort, defense observers say. Where we might get some clues about Trump’s Pentagon? The conservative Heritage Foundation — which Trump has relied on for advice — is releasing its third annual “Index of U.S. Military Strength” today, the “latest assessments of global threats and the U.S. military.” A common theme in the two previous versions of the report are that the military is too small, in terms of people and equipment, to fight two wars simultaneously. Speakers at next week’s release event include Rep. Michael Turner, Ohio; Dakota Wood, senior research fellow, defense programs and editor, Index of U.S. Military Strength; and Thomas Spoehr, a retired Army lieutenant general and director of Heritage’s Center for National Defense. Welcome! You’ve reached Defense One’s Global Business Brief. With the dust still settling from Trump’s victory, we’ll be spending the next few months focused on the transition and what it means for the business of defense.

From Defense One Defense Stocks Soar on News of Trump Victory // Marcus Weisgerber In early trading, the new commander in chief’s promises to rebuild the American military are helping defense stocks buck the wider market plunge. Obama’s Final Arms-Export Tally More than Doubles Bush’s // Marcus Weisgerber and Caroline Houck Most of the $278 billion in approved sales have gone to Saudi Arabia and other Mideast allies. Yes, Big Data Did Triumph on Election Day // Patrick Tucker One computer forecasting system predicted Trump’s victory — the one with the least human input. New Faces at the Pentagon There has been widespread speculation in recent months about top Pentagon officials who wanted to remain their positions should Clinton be elected president. So who is might be in line for jobs in a Trump Pentagon? While there have been reports though that the Trump team has had difficulty filling national security seats, my pal Dan Lamothe at The Washington Post has a good write-up for some of the names being tossed around, Sen. Jeff Sessions, Rep. Duncan Hunter and Steven Hadley. Joseph Schmitz, a lawyer who served as the Pentagon’s inspector general during the George W. Bush administration, has advised Trump and could be in line for a security-related position. There had even been whispers — much earlier this year — that Defense Secretary Ash Carter was interested in sticking around. But it’s likely that the only Obama appointee who might stick around to help with the transition is Deputy Defense Secretary Bob Work. Frank Kendall, the undersecretary for acquisition, technology and logistics, wanted to stay, but that’s highly unlikely now, sources say. And don’t forget the looming legislation from Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., that would eliminate Kendall’s undersecretary position entirely. Sierra Nevada Expanding Drone Business Now to some non-election news. Sierra Nevada, the privately held aerospace and defense firm, and its subsidiary Kutta Technologies plan to open an office in Huntsville, Alabama, near the Army’s Redstone Arsenal. Kutta specializes in drone technology, notably mobile ground controllers for soldiers on the battlefield. “Having a local presence near Redstone Arsenal is a tremendous opportunity to improve our ability to assist our customers and continue to advance new and existing programs,” said David Barnhard, Kutta’s director of business development. Want to Buy an Army Humvee? More than 400 of the AM General-made trucks are up for auction next week. “These specialty units are demilitarized and outfitted for sports and outdoor enthusiasts,” boasts IronPlanet, the online auction house brokering the sales. Bidding starts as low as $3,500 for damaged vehicles and $35,000 for ones in better shape. Many are painted in green camouflage. A portion of the proceeds will be donated to Fisher House Foundation, IronHouse said in a statement. With the Army buying more than 50,000 new Joint Light Tactical Vehicles, more Humvees could hit the surplus market in the coming years. Check out more, here.

(NFLX) a Buy on the Pullback Small Caps Leading the Party in the Markets View All Posts Boeing Co (NYSE:BA) — Boeing is the world’s largest manufacturer of commercial jets and the second-largest maker of military weapons. Long-term government contracts and a solid cash position, as well as a solid backlog of business, encouraged Standard & Poor’s to maintain a four-star buy rating on the stock. S&P projects earnings of $7.42 this year, down from $7.44 in 2015. Orders from the new administration to replace an aging fleet of military aircraft, including the KC46 tanker, or a newer version of that aircraft, and backlogs of civilian orders for 737’s and 787’s remain high and could enable Boeing to return to a historically high stream of revenues. S&P has a target price of $172 following third-quarter earnings-per-share of $3.51, which beat their $2.25 estimate on stronger revenues than projected. Diluted public shares, due to an aggressive share buyback program, also contributed to the recent EPS increase. EPS of $9.56 is projected for 2017. 7 A-Rated Cheap Stocks to Buy for Rapid-Fire Growth Boeing, like many blue chips, has spent most of 2016 in a rectangle (bullish consolidation pattern). The stock broke from that pattern when better-than-expected Q3 earnings were announced on Oct. 26. The breakout ran into resistance at about $145, pulled back to $140, and on yesterday’s election news jumped to a $145 close. Buy a partial position in BA at $145 and a full position at $140 with a target of $175, rendering a return of 25%-plus within six months. BA pays a dividend of $4.36 per share for a dividend yield around 3%.

The two-year grant will support a range of programs designed to provide diverse populations of students with meaningful arts education opportunities and increase overall arts participation by teachers and students across Edmonds and surrounding school districts. Specifically, the grant supports these ECA programs in both 2016 and 2017: annual Summer Arts Enrichment Camps, free Artist Residencies & Outreach programs for young people, and professional development opportunities for educators. The Boeing Company has supported education and outreach efforts at Edmonds Center for the Arts with a previous grant.  “In 2015-16, ECA was able to engage nearly 11,000 children, families, teachers and community members of all ages through Education & Outreach programming.  Summer Arts Enrichment Camps and Artist Residency & Outreach programs are critical areas of our ongoing engagement with the community. ECA is deeply grateful to The Boeing Company for this support and partnership,” said Gillian Jones, Director of Programming for ECA. ECA’s next Boeing-supported project is a free Teacher Workshop called Hocus Focus with internationally-renowned illusionist Kevin Spencer. OOSPI as an In-Service Education Agency, participants will be eligible to earn clock-hour credits.   Share this: Tweet SHARE Facebook Twitter tweet Previous articleReminder: Draft Highway 99 area plan to be presented at Nov. 10 open house Next articleReminder: Edmonds businesses once again celebrate with Localvore shopping event Nov. 12 Emily Hill LEAVE A REPLY Cancel reply Notify me of follow-up comments by email.

Astronauts, veterans open 'Heroes and Legends' at KSC James Dean , FLORIDA TODAY 4:43 p.m. EST November 11, 2016 The grand opening of Kennedy Space Center Visitors Complex's newest attraction, Heroes and Legends, featuring the U.S. Astronaut Hall of Fame, took place Friday morning, Nov. 11, 2016. (Photo: Delaware North photo) 332 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE More than 20 Hall of Fame astronauts were cheered during a Veterans Day ceremony officially opening the Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex’s newest attraction, fittingly named "Heroes and Legends." Including moonwalkers and spacewalkers, pilots and payload specialists and many military veterans, the space program legends took seats outside the building that houses a relocated and redesigned U.S. Astronaut Hall of Fame. Beneath a giant bas-relief sculpture of NASA's Original Seven, the astronauts reflected on their roles as American heroes. “We all thought about one thing,” said Apollo 7 astronaut Walt Cunningham, 84. “You don’t get any place in life unless you’re willing to stick your neck out a little, and that’s what we were willing to do.” “I don’t consider myself a hero,” said Apollo 13 commander Jim Lovell, 88. “I just did what I thought was proper and exciting, and something for the country and my family.” “It was just a tour of duty, a great tour of duty,” added Gemini and Apollo astronaut Tom Stafford, 86, who led the nation's first cooperative mission with Soviet cosmonauts. FLORIDA TODAY KSC's 'Heroes and Legends' to open on Veterans Day Friday’s ceremony completed 18 months and $20 million of work to open Heroes and Legends, sponsored by Boeing, in a renovated site that will become most guests’ first stop at the Visitor Complex. The experience opens with a discussion by astronauts and ordinary people talking about their heroes, from great explorers to a mom or dad. Guests then enter a stadium-style movie theater and don 3-D glasses for a seven-and-a-half-minute show immersing them in four pioneering space missions, starting with Alan Shepard’s 1961 flight to become the first American in space. Wind and scents add to the special effects. The tour continues through displays of memorabilia and historic artifacts — including a Redstone rocket and Wally Schirra's Sigma 7 capsule — highlighting heroic attributes, from curiosity to selflessness. The grand opening of Kennedy Space Center Visitors Complex's newest attraction, Heroes and Legends, featuring the U.S. Astronaut Hall of Fame, took place Friday morning, Nov. 11, 2016.  (Photo: Delaware North photo) But Apollo 11 moonwalker Buzz Aldrin, 86, said one trait was missing: “Tenacious innovation,” he said. “It is absolutely essential to innovate, do things better.” The tour culminates in a new Hall of Fame rotunda, which has replaced the hall previously located miles away on the mainland, often missed by visitors. Static portraits have been supplemented with more interactive video displays of the astronauts and their missions. “It’s a modern, 3-D experience that people are really going to enjoy,” said Brian Duffy, 63, a shuttle commander inducted in the most recent Hall of Fame class. “Being one of the members in there is beyond my dreams that it would ever happen, because I’m in there with my heroes. These are the heroes that inspired me.” Family and teachers also were crucial to his success, Duffy said. FLORIDA TODAY GOES-R weather satellite placed on Atlas V rocket Nine-year-old Orlando resident Moses Forrest declared Heroes and Legends "awesome." Asked his favorite part, he responded: "All of it." Faith Stokes, 36, of Jacksonville, also enjoyed the exhibits and seeing so many astronaut heroes in person on Friday. “They paved the way for things that were unknown and they put their lives at risk, not knowing the outcome — if they would die in space, of if their missions would be successful,” she said. “It is an inspiration to everyone in the future.” Throughout Veterans Day weekend, NASA and Visitor Complex operator Delaware North are offering free admission to active duty or veteran members of the military, and discounted tickets for up to three family members. Heroes and Legends' grand opening coincides with Space Rendezvous, an autograph and fundraising show running through the weekend at the Visitor Complex and the Hilton Cocoa Beach Oceanfront hotel to raise money for the Astronaut Scholarship Foundation.

(collectSPACE) November 11, 2016 — Astronauts from four branches of the U.S. military spent Veteran's Day at NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida on Friday (Nov. 11), attending the launch of a public attraction devoted to honoring America's spaceflight pioneers. James Lovell, who served as a Navy Captain; Buzz Aldrin, who was a U.S. Air Force Colonel; Walt Cunningham, who was also a colonel in the U.S. Marine Corps; and Bruce Melnick, who is one of only two astronauts to hail from the U.S. Coast Guard, joined more than 20 other military and civilian astronauts at a ceremony and ribbon cutting for the new "Heroes & Legends, featuring the U.S. Astronaut Hall of Fame" exhibit at NASA's Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex. "It is no coincidence that we chose to celebrate the grand opening of Heroes & Legends on this day, Veteran's Day," said John Zarella, a former CNN news correspondent who served as the master of ceremonies. "Many, many of our astronaut heroes are also members of the United States Armed Forces, but not only that, they have all served their country as members of NASA's elite astronaut corps, each one willing to undertake extremely dangerous missions to advance scientific study to benefit all of humanity."

(NASA) Intended as the first stop after guests enter the Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex, Heroes & Legends focuses on the early years of U.S. human spaceflight to explore the concept of heroism. The 37,000 square foot (3,440 sq. m.) attraction marries cutting-edge technology with immersive visual effects, authentic astronaut artifacts and interactive exhibits. "This great big attraction also has a great big name — 'Heroes & Legends, featuring the United States Astronaut Hall of Fame, presented by Boeing. That is because this attraction tells the story of many, many people — not only the astronaut heroes whose daring missions are brought to life inside these walls, but also the countless people and companies who worked behind the scenes to enable those missions to happen," said Therrin Protze, chief operating officer of the Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex. Protze delivered his remarks standing in front of the post-modern-inspired façade of the new exhibit, which features a towering bas relief of America's first astronauts, NASA's original Mercury 7. "It was the six surviving Mercury astronauts who were the first to conceive a place where space explorers would be remembered," said Dan Brandenstein, an Astronaut Hall of Fame inductee and chairman of the Astronaut Scholarship Foundation. "I can only imagine how proud and humbled they'd have been, not only to see themselves immortalized on this wall, but to see the legacy of spaceflight that they all created." "I'm certain that Heroes & Legends far surpasses anything that they would have imagined," said Brandenstein. The opening ceremony for "Heroes & Legends" at Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex in Florida. (collectSPACE) Heroes & Legends is the first attraction at Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex to bear the name of its corporate sponsor, Boeing, which now comprises the companies that built the Mercury and Gemini spacecraft showcased in the exhibit. "I think it is appropriate going into our next 100 years as a company ... that we look back at the heroes that got us to this point," said John Elbon, the vice president and general manager of Boeing's Space Exploration division. "We are excited to partner with the Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex on this Heroes & Legends attraction." The goal of Heroes & Legends, as described by the Visitor Complex, is for the public to gain a renewed sense of pride and more indepth understanding of the qualities of heroism represented by NASA's pioneering astronauts — and why they deserve admiration and respect. "I think it is important as you tour this exhibit to remember all of the dedication and the hard work that it took for those of us who were involved in the astronaut program," said Charlie Duke, who in 1972 became the tenth man to walk on the moon. "Hopefully, it will be an inspiration to you and your grandkids and your kids."

Lim @pauljlim Nov. 11, 2016 SHARE Richard Drew—AP Trader Anthony RInaldi, left, works on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, November 7, 2016. The conventional wisdom appears to be flawed. Before Tuesday’s election, conventional wisdom said the stock market would tank if Donald Trump were elected president, given Wall Street fears over his threats to rip up global trade deals. That turned out to be dead wrong. While stock market jitters certainly spiked in after-hours trading following his upset win, the Dow Jones industrial average actually jumped nearly 500 points in the first two trading days following Trump’s surprise win. Wall Street’s new take: Trump could fuel a strong rally in stocks as he seems to be promising an unusually bipartisan form of government stimulus. He says he wants to give Republicans the massive tax cuts they want while simultaneously promising hundreds of billions of dollars for infrastructure projects that will create jobs that Democrats support. Yet this bit of conventional wisdom is also be flawed. If you look at the market’s reaction to Trump, it’s actually been a tale of two markets, with big winners but also a lot of big losers. You can get a better sense of who those winners and losers are by simply looking at two of the market’s benchmarks: the Dow and the Nasdaq Composite index. What the Dow Is Telling You The Dow, made up of just 30 large stocks that are supposed to reflect the nature of our economy, has been soaring in the wake of Trump’s victory. Understand which stocks drive the Dow. More than 40% of the benchmark index is composed of old-guard industrial stocks and financial shares that stand to be big winners initially under a Trump administration. Why industrials win: Trump has pledged to spend up to $1 trillion on infrastructure projects around the country to spur job creation and economic growth. “Potential fiscal stimulus would be of net benefit to infrastructure plays,” says Tom Stringfellow, chief investment officer for Frost Investment Advisers. That means companies like Caterpillar CATERPILLAR INC. CAT 0.29% , which makes heavy construction equipment needed for bridge and road construction jobs. At the same time, Trump promised throughout the campaign to boost military spending, which would benefit defense contractors such as Boeing BOEING COMPANY BA -1.25% and United Technologies. Why financials win: Shares of big banks and financial institutions have soared more than 10% in just the past week. Why? The fiscal stimulus that Trump promises through infrastructure spending and tax cuts is likely to re-inflate the economy — and with it comes inflation. Because bond investors hate inflation, the yield on 10-year Treasury bonds has soared from 1.8% before the election to 2.14% today. This is important because banks raise capital by taking in short term deposits on which they currently have to pay next to nothing in interest because short-term rates controlled by the Federal Reserve are so low. Then they lend that money out at longer term rates, which are now rising. If 10-year yields continue to lift, profit margins at banks will rise too, which is good for this sector. At the same time, Trump has promised to dismantle financial regulations like the Dodd-Frank Act, which was created in the aftermath of the financial crisis. What the Nasdaq Is Telling You Less than 13% of the Nasdaq composite consists of financials and industrials. Technology and healthcare stocks make up about 60% of the index. This explains why the Nasdaq has fallen while the Dow has risen in the aftermath of Trump’s win. Why technology may lose. As much as Trump has been a champion for business, he has saved his most critical remarks for Silicon Valley, a huge source of fundraising for the Democrats. In fact, During the campaign, he accused Amazon as having “huge antitrust problems” and accused Amazon of not being taxed enough. Meanwhile, he questioned whether Google was suppressing search hits on bad news for his rival Hillary Clinton. As a result, the so-called FANG stocks that have been leading tech’s run in recent years — Facebook FACEBOOK INC. FB 1.84% , Apple APPLE INC. AAPL 1.31% , Netflix NETFLIX INC. NFLX 0.19% , and Google ALPHABET INC. GOOGL 2.91% — have all lost value since Nov. 7, even as the rest of the market has risen. Why some healthcare may lose. To be fair, some parts of the healthcare sector have seen a lift in the wake of Trump’s win. Biotech stocks, for instance, have jumped nearly 16% in the past week while pharmaceutical shares are up nearly 8% on expectations that there will be less regulations. They also moved as the market feared that Hillary Clinton might impose price controls on that sector. “Trump hasn’t railed against the industry’s drug pricing the way Hillary Clinton did while campaigning,” notes Ed Yardeni, chief investment strategist for Yardeni Research. On the other hand, Trump’s threat of killing the Affordable Care Act means that fewer Americans will be covered by health insurance. Fewer people covered means fewer customers for the nation’s hospitals and health insurers. Tap to read full story Read Next Your browser is out of date.

Expectations of a bonanza of defense spending soared on Republican Donald Trump's first day as president-elect. (U.S. Army photo/Aaron Ellerman) Posted By: Brendan McGarry November 11, 2016 The big defense firms already had predicted good times ahead no matter who won the election, and the expectations of a bonanza of defense spending soared on Donald Trump’s first day as president-elect. Even as the market initially tanked Wednesday on word that Trump had won, stocks for Lockheed Martin Corp., Northrop Grumman Corp., General Dynamics Corp., Boeing Co., Huntington Ingalls Industries Inc. and others bucked the trend and were posting major gains. The market then rallied and the Dow Jones industrial average closed at a record high of 18,807.88. In late October, when polls showed that Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton was likely to win, Northrop was touting solid third-quarter earnings as a sign of more profits ahead for the defense industry. “It is an interesting time in that it’s clear that there’s a significant re-capitalization wave that’s underway across a number of our customer communities,” Northrop Chief Executive Officer Wes Bush said. “Quite frankly, it’s one that’s been deferred for quite a long time.” The company last year won the contract to build the new B-21 Raider stealth bomber for the Air Force. Since the Trump victory, defense industry analysts have predicted defense spending would surge as the new White House administration and the Republican-controlled House and Senate move to end the sending caps known as sequestration under the Budget Control  Act of 2013. In a post for Forbes, analyst and Pentagon consultant Loren Thompson said “it appears the Obama-era drought in Pentagon demand for new weapons is over.” “Combined with Republican retention of majorities in both chambers of Congress, Trump’s win signals that the gridlock restraining increases in defense outlays will soon disappear,” said Thompson, chief operating officer for the non-profit Lexington Institute. Thompson and other analysts pointed to Trump’s campaign pledges to boost the size of the Army and the Marine Corps, add 1,200 fighter aircraft to the Air Force and increase the size of the Navy to 350 ships. In addition, Trump has argued to speed up the modernization of the nation’s nuclear force to include replacements for the aging Minuteman III Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles and a new class of ballistic-missile submarines. In a September campaign speech, Trump said, “We currently have the smallest Army since 1940. The Navy is among the smallest it has been since 1915, and the Air Force is the smallest it has been since 1947.” Trump vowed a turnaround, but how he would pay for it was unclear beyond general pledges of “common sense reforms that eliminate government waste and budget gimmicks.” Whether the spigot of defense funding opens and becomes a bonanza remains to be seen.

Gulf executives who were upset by Donald Trump's campaign trail comments about Muslims took a conciliatory tone following his election victory and said they were open for business with the United States. In Dubai, boards displaying the President-elect's name and his support for a DAMAC project to build a gated community, spa and Trump-branded golf course can be seen from a road on the edge of the city. Gulf business links with Trump and other U.S. firms are strong. The United States imported $32.4 billion of goods including oil from the six Gulf countries in 2015 and the region is the most important client base for Boeing and a number of U.S. defense firms. The Gulf's sovereign wealth funds also have hundreds of billions of dollars of U.S. investments. Nevertheless, Arab business figures were angry about Trump's campaign calls for Muslims to be banned from entering the United States, following the murder of 14 people in San Bernardino, California, by a Muslim couple in December 2015. Saudi Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, head of investment firm Kingdom Holding 4280.SE which has stakes in U.S. firms including Citigroup and Twitter, called him a "disgrace not only to the GOP but to all America". However, the billionaire was among those wishing him well on Wednesday, tweeting: "President elect @realDonaldTrump whatever the past differences, America has spoken, congratulations & best wishes for your presidency." Another billionaire businessman, Khalaf al-Habtoor, who worked with Trump on a construction project that was halted in 2008, wrote an op-ed in a local newspaper in August last year backing Trump for the presidency. But Habtoor backtracked after Trump's Muslim comments and said Gulf money would quit the U.S. if he won. Speaking to Arabian Business on Wednesday, Habtoor insisted Trump's comments on Muslims "were for the election only" and he would now tone down his rhetoric, something that would open the door to re-establishing good relations with the Gulf. Political ties between the United States and the Gulf, in particular Saudi Arabia, have been strained by President Barack Obama's pursuit of a nuclear deal with Iran, which has led to opinions that America has abandoned its long-term allies in favor of their regional rival. Relations were also damaged by the U.S. Congress's approval in September of legislation which paves the way for families of the victims of the Sept. 11 terrorist attack to sue the government of Saudi Arabia, whose citizens accounted for 15 of the 19 hijackers. 'Fair competitor' Some Gulf firms reassessed their links with Trump at the end of last year: DAMAC temporarily removed references to his name from advertising, and regional retailer Landmark Group pulled a Trump-branded line of homeware from its Lifestyle chain of department stores. But a spokeswoman for DAMAC told Reuters on Thursday that Trump-linked projects still carried his name. Landmark Group declined to comment. Mohammed al-Ardhi, executive chairman of alternative investment firm Investcorp, which has billions of dollars in U.S. real estate and other investments, was complementary about Trump. "Investcorp knows that Mr. Trump is fair because we competed against him on the Tiffany acquisition and he did not mind us winning that deal," Ardhi told an investor event on Wednesday, referring to its 1984 purchase of the New York jewelry firm. Gulf sovereign wealth funds have invested huge sums of cash into the American economy. Abu Dhabi Investment Authority has the largest geographical weighting for its estimated-$792 billion portfolio in North America at between 35 and 50 percent. It owns significant amounts of real estate for example, including a number of high-end hotels in major U.S. cities. The Qatar Investment Authority said in September 2015 it would help the Gulf state invest $35 billion in the U.S. over five years. Spokesmen for the QIA and ADIA declined to comment on the election. Uncertainty for airlines Gulf airlines are waiting to see where Trump stands on a disagreement with U.S. carriers. A group including American Airlines and United Airlines say United Arab Emirates-based Emirates and Etihad Airways, and Qatar Airways, have unfairly benefited from state subsidies, and have called for a review of the Open Skies trade agreement with those countries. Some Gulf airline executives had previously expressed concerns that Trump could favor U.S. interests at the expense of the rest of the global aviation industry. "It's so important for our business that the liberalization that spreads through from the Clinton era of politics on global trade continues," Emirates President Tim Clark told reporters in Dubai on Oct. 18, adding Trump "may go about the introduction of more constraints on global trade". A spokeswoman for Emirates and spokesman for Etihad Airways declined to comment on the election result.

"Our relationship goes way back, and I was one of the first to commend Donald on his well-deserved new leadership position," he said in a statement to Reuters.

These members of the U.S. Armed Forces were the guests of honor at this annual event that honors their service to the country. The festivities started in the museum's B.B.'s Stage Door Canteen, where Shotgun Jazz Band performed. Many partygoers also discovered the dessert station, located in the American Sector Restaurant, which offered up an array of desserts throughout the night.     The main event was held in the U.S. Freedom Pavilion: the Boeing Center, where event organizers tried something a little different this year: instead of having a formal, sit-down dinner, the food -- conceived by American Sector Restaurant Chef Eric Cook, who once served in the Marine Corps -- was served buffet style with stations around the room. Museum President and CEO Nick Mueller greeted partygoers from the stage, where he honored those active-duty and veterans in the armed forces by asking them to stand up for recognition. He also introduced the event's presenting sponsors Jessica and Ray Brandt (of the Ray and Jessica Brandt Family Foundation); Mr. Brandt is a new museum board member. Event co-chair Bill Detweiler (along with wife Maureen Detweiler) introduced officers in the audience, including Lt. General Rex McMillian (U.S. Marine Corps), Mjr. General (Ret.) David M. Mize (U.S. Marine Corps), Mjr. General (Ret.) Thomas Sands (U.S. Army Corps), Col. Michael Clancy (U.S. Army Corps), Mjr. General (Ret.) Ron Richard (U.S. Marine Corps) and Rear Admiral David Callahan (U.S. Coast Guard). "This year's Victory Ball begins a new tradition at the museum," said the Detweilers in a joint statement. "It provides an opportunity for us to honor our veterans and members of the military from all wars and conflicts, and to express our thanks for their service and sacrifice." Once the official duties were completed, the Victory Swing Orchestra returned to the stage with the Victory Belles to perform Big Band songs from the 1940s; later in the night, DJ Ann Glaviano played songs from the 1950s to the 1970s. Among the attendees who filled the building were Paulette and Frank Stewart, Pam and Bill Ryan, Jackie Clarkson, Ben Martinez, Pam Friedler and Eduardo Rodriguez, Sheryl and Bob Merrick, Madlyn and Paul Hilliard, Cindy and Ron Mistrot, Marshall Hevron, Shannon and Mark Ferketish, Lillian and Jimmy Maurin, Ann and John Koerner, Beth Mueller, Sylvia and John Laborde, and Renee and Peter Laborde.  ****** To reach Sue Strachan, send an email to socialscene@nola.com or call 504.450.5904.

Photo: Reuters mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 11:30 PM, November 11, 2016 DUBAI - Gulf executives who were upset by Donald Trump's campaign trail comments about Muslims took a conciliatory tone following his election victory and said they were open for business with the United States. In Dubai, boards displaying the President-elect's name and his support for a DAMAC <DAMAC.DU> project to build a gated community, spa and Trump-branded golf course can be seen from a road on the edge of the city. Gulf business links with Trump and other U.S. firms are strong. The United States imported $32.4 billion of goods including oil from the six Gulf countries in 2015 and the region is the most important client base for Boeing <BA.N> and a number of U.S. defense firms. The Gulf's sovereign wealth funds also have hundreds of billions of dollars of U.S. investments. Nevertheless, Arab business figures were angry about Trump's campaign calls for Muslims to be banned from entering the United States, following the murder of 14 people in San Bernardino, California, by a Muslim couple in December 2015. Saudi Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, head of investment firm Kingdom Holding <4280.SE> which has stakes in U.S. firms including Citigroup <C.N> and Twitter <TWTR.N>, called him a "disgrace not only to the GOP but to all America". However, the billionaire was among those wishing him well on Wednesday, tweeting: "President elect @realDonaldTrump whatever the past differences, America has spoken, congratulations & best wishes for your presidency." Another billionaire businessman, Khalaf al-Habtoor, who worked with Trump on a construction project that was halted in 2008, wrote an op-ed in a local newspaper in August last year backing Trump for the presidency. But Habtoor backtracked after Trump's Muslim comments and said Gulf money would quit the U.S. if he won. Speaking to Arabian Business on Wednesday, Habtoor insisted Trump's comments on Muslims "were for the election only" and he would now tone down his rhetoric, something that would open the door to re-establishing good relations with the Gulf. Political ties between the United States and the Gulf, in particular Saudi Arabia, have been strained by President Barack Obama's pursuit of a nuclear deal with Iran, which has led to opinions that America has abandoned its long-term allies in favor of their regional rival. Relations were also damaged by the U.S. Congress's approval in September of legislation which paves the way for families of the victims of the Sept. 11 terrorist attack to sue the government of Saudi Arabia, whose citizens accounted for 15 of the 19 hijackers. "FAIR COMPETITOR" Some Gulf firms reassessed their links with Trump at the end of last year: DAMAC temporarily removed references to his name from advertising, and regional retailer Landmark Group pulled a Trump-branded line of homeware from its Lifestyle chain of department stores. But a spokeswoman for DAMAC told Reuters on Thursday that Trump-linked projects still carried his name. Landmark Group declined to comment. Mohammed al-Ardhi, executive chairman of alternative investment firm Investcorp <INVB.BH>, which has billions of dollars in U.S. real estate and other investments, was complementary about Trump. "Investcorp knows that Mr. Trump is fair because we competed against him on the Tiffany acquisition and he did not mind us winning that deal," Ardhi told an investor event on Wednesday, referring to its 1984 purchase of the New York jewelry firm. Gulf sovereign wealth funds have invested huge sums of cash into the American economy. Abu Dhabi Investment Authority has the largest geographical weighting for its estimated-$792 billion portfolio in North America at between 35 and 50 percent. It owns significant amounts of real estate for example, including a number of high-end hotels in major U.S. cities. The Qatar Investment Authority said in September 2015 it would help the Gulf state invest $35 billion in the U.S. over five years. Spokesmen for the QIA and ADIA declined to comment on the election. UNCERTAINTY FOR AIRLINES Gulf airlines are waiting to see where Trump stands on a disagreement with U.S. carriers. A group including American Airlines <AAL.O> and United Airlines [UALCO.UL] say United Arab Emirates-based Emirates [EMIRA.UL] and Etihad Airways, and Qatar Airways, have unfairly benefited from state subsidies, and have called for a review of the Open Skies trade agreement with those countries. Some Gulf airline executives had previously expressed concerns that Trump could favor U.S. interests at the expense of the rest of the global aviation industry. "It's so important for our business that the liberalization that spreads through from the Clinton era of politics on global trade continues," Emirates President Tim Clark told reporters in Dubai on Oct. 18, adding Trump "may go about the introduction of more constraints on global trade". A spokeswoman for Emirates and spokesman for Etihad Airways declined to comment on the election result. However, Qatar Airways' Group Chief Executive Akbar al-Baker, who voiced support for Trump even after his comments about Muslims, welcomed his victory. "Our relationship goes way back, and I was one of the first to commend Donald on his well-deserved new leadership position," he said in a statement to Reuters.

It is the first-ever service from Munich to that airport, and will be operated with an Air Atlanta Icelandic Boeing B747-400F. Bavaria, with its powerful industrial base and the many companies in the automotive, mechanical engineering, electrical and chemical sectors that rely on the import and export of goods, is a key region in Germany for Senator International. By launching a direct connection to Greenville/Spartanburg – initially with one flight per week – the company is now expanding the services offered to its customers. “With Munich, we now have our own optimal freight connection between the vital German and US markets for the first time. The hub in southern Germany was a very conscious choice for us. We see enormous potential here, and not only for this region,” said Tim-Oliver Kirschbaum, the managing director of Senator International. “Serving this new route with a B747-400F is a strong affirmation of Munich’s importance as an airfreight center. Every day, goods originating in Bavaria, other parts of southern Germany, Austria, eastern Europe and northern Italy are flown from our airport to destinations all over the world. We’re looking forward to working together in the coming years with companies like Senator International on the continuing development of Munich Airport as a cargo hub,” said Dr Michael Kerkloh, the CEO of Munich Airport.

(TSX: AVP) (the “Company”, “Avcorp” or the “Avcorp Group”) is pleased to announce that it has been awarded a long-term production contract with the Aerospace Company of Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd. (“FHI”), a tier-one supplier to major original equipment manufacturers (“OEM”) of commercial and defence aircraft around the world. Avcorp will produce complex composite structural components for FHI that will be assembled for the Boeing 787 center wing box. Avcorp, which will produce the components from its Composite Fabrication facility located in Gardena, California, expects that production volumes will grow by as much as 50% over historical supply rates. “The contract award with FHI is significant on a number of levels,” said Mr. Peter George, CEO of Avcorp Industries. “First, it transitions our role with FHI from being a supplier with short-term purchase orders to one with a long-term contract for complex composite components for the Boeing 787 platform. Second, it extends our reach within the Boeing supply chain by complementing our long-standing relationship with the OEM. Both developments are due to our growing reputation as a quality supplier and to the recent investments we have made towards developing expertise in the manufacture of complex composite materials.” As a result of the contract award, Avcorp’s order backlog is currently estimated at $901 million. The new total reflects the cumulative net effect of recent production deliveries as well as the addition of production contract with FHI.

Daoud Kuttab Will Palestinian airlines fly again? A resident from the Gaza strip, holding dual citizenship [AFP] Date of publication: 11 November, 2016 Share this page: 0 twitter Comment: Could the possibility of a joint Jordanian, Israeli, Palestinian airport somewhere in the northern part of the West Bank revive Palestinian hopes for a better future? asks Daoud Kuttab Tags: Palestinian Airlines, Palestine, Israel, Gaza, West Bank, Jordan, Avigdor Liberman, Boeing Ask any Palestinian and especially those living in Gaza about their number one problem of living under occupation and they are most likely to say that freedom of movement is the most difficult issue they face. They will cite permanent checkpoints or temporary ones in the West Bank. They will most certainly talk about the next to impossible task of getting a permit to travel 45 minutes from Gaza to Jerusalem or simply the long and dangerous Wadi Nar road connecting Ramallah with Bethlehem without going through the walled East Jerusalem. While Gaza has been under a siege for nine years, West Bankers wishing to travel have no choice but to go through Jordan which means that they need to pass through Palestinian and Jordanian border patrols at the King Hussein bridge, with no way of knowing how long it could take. Palestinian airlines at one time was a godsend to the people of Gaza. Using the Rafah airport, Palestinians in the Gaza Strip where able to fly from Rafah to Amman, Cairo or Baghdad and if needed, from there to anywhere in the world. In 1999 a Palestinian could travel from Amman or Cairo and reach his Gaza home within an hour or two and that included going through an Israeli security check. In its short lifetime since establishment in May 1995, Palestinian airlines owned two propeller planes and an older Boeing jet that was donated by Prince Walid Ben Talal. It was one of the Palestinian government agencies that was actually producing revenue in addition to it being a huge relief for the population of Gaza. Those were the golden days according to Khaled Mubarak, Palestinian Airlines' CEO who is based in Amman, Jordan. "When the second intifada broke in October 2000 and the Israeli airport liaison officer was killed, we were not able to fly. Israel dug up the runway and prevented us from flying either way." For a while, Palestinian Airlines was able to use the nearby El-Arish airport, but eventually the siege of Gaza and the deteriorating security situation in Sinai and meant that this airport alternative was unusable. 'Israel dug up the runway and prevented us from flying' - Khaled Mubarak, Palestinian Airlines CEO The lack of an airport has crippled the newly established airline company, forcing it to find alternative activities for its small fleet. The company's CEO says that one propeller plane was rented out in Africa while the other is now in Holland for maintenance. The old Boeing was sold for parts and the company's 120 staff have nothing to do as they await a political solution that can allow them to fly again. Avigdor Lieberman, the Israeli defence minister touched on this subject in his recent interview with the Palestinian daily Al Quds. He spoke as a typical colonial occupier; offering perks and using threats. If Hamas stops digging tunnels and launching rockets we will not only let them fly out of Gaza but we will rebuild their airport for them, he said. Lieberman's carrot also included the threat that in the next war Gaza will be the last one "because we will completely destroy them". Israel has also unilaterally suggested creating a $5 billion dollar man-made island off Gaza that can include a sea port and an airport. Palestinians have not even been consulted on this idea, which many believe is aimed at diverting attention from their illegal siege of Gaza. The lack of an airport has crippled the newly established airline company Without a solution that could lead to the end of the Gaza siege some Palestinians are thinking of an alternative airport in the West Bank. Former Palestinian prime minister Salam Fayyad had suggested in 2009 the building of an international airport near Jericho.  The Japanese government officials are discussing the possibility of a joint Jordanian, Israeli, Palestinian airport somewhere in the northern part of the West Bank. Japan has also been focused on supporting Palestinian agricultural exports. The issue of a Palestinian airport or using Palestinian airlines to travel seems such a farfetched dream that Palestinians have long since written it off. The political and security restrictions imposed by the Israeli occupiers have been so powerful that they have stunted any creative thinking in this direction. The emotional and moral power of Palestinians using their own airlines and traveling the world from their airport could do more to revive Palestinian hopes and aspirations of a better future, than thousands of words by politicians or empty political rhetoric in conferences.

Posted 11 Nov 2016 23:00 Donald Trump gives a thumbs up sign as he walks with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on Capitol Hill in Washington. REUTERS/Joshua Roberts Enlarge Caption  Email More A A DUBAI: Gulf executives who were upset by Donald Trump's campaign trail comments about Muslims took a conciliatory tone following his election victory and said they were open for business with the United States. In Dubai, boards displaying the President-elect's name and his support for a DAMAC project to build a gated community, spa and Trump-branded golf course can be seen from a road on the edge of the city. Gulf business links with Trump and other U.S. firms are strong. The United States imported US$32.4 billion of goods including oil from the six Gulf countries in 2015 and the region is the most important client base for Boeing and a number of U.S. defense firms. The Gulf's sovereign wealth funds also have hundreds of billions of dollars of U.S. investments. Nevertheless, Arab business figures were angry about Trump's campaign calls for Muslims to be banned from entering the United States, following the murder of 14 people in San Bernardino, California, by a Muslim couple in December 2015. Saudi Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, head of investment firm Kingdom Holding which has stakes in U.S. firms including Citigroup and Twitter , called him a "disgrace not only to the GOP but to all America". However, the billionaire was among those wishing him well on Wednesday, tweeting: "President elect @realDonaldTrump whatever the past differences, America has spoken, congratulations & best wishes for your presidency." Another billionaire businessman, Khalaf al-Habtoor, who worked with Trump on a construction project that was halted in 2008, wrote an op-ed in a local newspaper in August last year backing Trump for the presidency. But Habtoor backtracked after Trump's Muslim comments and said Gulf money would quit the U.S. if he won. Speaking to Arabian Business on Wednesday, Habtoor insisted Trump's comments on Muslims "were for the election only" and he would now tone down his rhetoric, something that would open the door to re-establishing good relations with the Gulf. Political ties between the United States and the Gulf, in particular Saudi Arabia, have been strained by President Barack Obama's pursuit of a nuclear deal with Iran, which has led to opinions that America has abandoned its long-term allies in favor of their regional rival. Relations were also damaged by the U.S. Congress's approval in September of legislation which paves the way for families of the victims of the Sept. 11 terrorist attack to sue the government of Saudi Arabia, whose citizens accounted for 15 of the 19 hijackers. "FAIR COMPETITOR" Some Gulf firms reassessed their links with Trump at the end of last year: DAMAC temporarily removed references to his name from advertising, and regional retailer Landmark Group pulled a Trump-branded line of homeware from its Lifestyle chain of department stores. But a spokeswoman for DAMAC told Reuters on Thursday that Trump-linked projects still carried his name. Landmark Group declined to comment. Mohammed al-Ardhi, executive chairman of alternative investment firm Investcorp , which has billions of dollars in U.S. real estate and other investments, was complementary about Trump. "Investcorp knows that Mr. Trump is fair because we competed against him on the Tiffany acquisition and he did not mind us winning that deal," Ardhi told an investor event on Wednesday, referring to its 1984 purchase of the New York jewelry firm. Gulf sovereign wealth funds have invested huge sums of cash into the American economy. Abu Dhabi Investment Authority has the largest geographical weighting for its estimated-US$792 billion portfolio in North America at between 35 and 50 percent. It owns significant amounts of real estate for example, including a number of high-end hotels in major U.S. cities. The Qatar Investment Authority said in September 2015 it would help the Gulf state invest US$35 billion in the U.S. over five years. Spokesmen for the QIA and ADIA declined to comment on the election. UNCERTAINTY FOR AIRLINES Gulf airlines are waiting to see where Trump stands on a disagreement with U.S. carriers. A group including American Airlines and United Airlines say United Arab Emirates-based Emirates and Etihad Airways, and Qatar Airways, have unfairly benefited from state subsidies, and have called for a review of the Open Skies trade agreement with those countries. Some Gulf airline executives had previously expressed concerns that Trump could favor U.S. interests at the expense of the rest of the global aviation industry. "It's so important for our business that the liberalization that spreads through from the Clinton era of politics on global trade continues," Emirates President Tim Clark told reporters in Dubai on Oct. 18, adding Trump "may go about the introduction of more constraints on global trade". A spokeswoman for Emirates and spokesman for Etihad Airways declined to comment on the election result. However, Qatar Airways' Group Chief Executive Akbar al-Baker, who voiced support for Trump even after his comments about Muslims, welcomed his victory. "Our relationship goes way back, and I was one of the first to commend Donald on his well-deserved new leadership position," he said in a statement to Reuters.

Well, there’s nothing like a nice rocket launch to keep your mind off current events — and also remind you of the incredible things that humans can accomplish when they work together. The United Launch Alliance, the Boeing and Lockheed Martin partnership, is sending one of its Atlas V rockets into space today. The vehicle is slated to take off from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California at 1:30PM ET. Riding on top of the rocket is WorldView-4 — a commercial imaging satellite that will be operated by DigitalGlobe. The probe will join three other WorldView satellites already in orbit and capture high-resolution images of the Earth’s surface. WorldView-4 has the ability to image close to 263,000 square miles a day, and the entire four-satellite constellation can capture a single location up to 4.5 times daily. WorldView-4 will sit in a sun-synchronous orbit To get these awesome images, WorldView-4 will sit in a Sun-synchronous orbit. It’s a polar orbit that will take the satellite from pole to pole, unlike lower Earth orbit, for instance, which runs from west to east near the equator. Sun-synchronous orbit is a special kind of polar orbit, too, that allows a satellite to travel over the same part of Earth at the same time each day. It’s taken a few months for this launch to finally get off the ground. WorldView-4 was originally scheduled to launch on September 16th, but takeoff was delayed after ULA detected a small fuel leak. A second attempt to launch the satellite two days later was then scrubbed due to wildfires in a canyon south of Vandenberg Air Force Base. The launch pad was unharmed, but the fires took a week to contain and damaged electrical wiring to the facility. That damage has taken a few weeks to repair. But now, everything is look good for the mission today, with a 90 percent chance of launch according to ULA CEO Tory Bruno. The company has a 15-minute launch window starting at 1:30PM, and to see this rocket take flight, check back here at 1:05PM ET when ULA’s live broadcast of the launch begins.

S. equities in the aerospace and defense sector. The companies in the ETF include manufacturers, assemblers and distributors of aircraft and aircraft parts, makers of drones, and other highly specialized defense assemblies. This fund receives Morningstar’s highest rating (five stars), and on Wednesday its rating by Standard & Poor’s was increased to “overweight.” Market Return Performance as of Oct. 31: Year-to-date +11.08%, three-year 11.62%, five-year 18.42%. Top ten holdings include: Boeing Co (NYSE:BA), United Technologies Corporation (NYSE:UTX), Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT), Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC), General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD), Raytheon Company (NYSE:RTN), TransDigm Group Incorporated (NYSE:TDG), Rockwell Collins, Inc. (NYSE:COL), Textron Inc. (NYSE:TXT), and L-3 Communication Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:LLL). At the current price, this ETF has an annualized dividend yield of approximately 1% with a net expense ratio of 0.44%, or $44 per $10,000 invested annually. The 7 Best Dividend Stocks to Buy for 2017 After the Brexit plunge in June, ITA rallied to a new all-time closing high on Aug. 15 at $132.73. However, a combination of profit-taking and the government’s projection of less defense spending caused a gradual decline to a triple bottom along the bullish support line. The final, and successful, test of the line occurred this week, when the ETF jumped from its support, cutting through the 50-day moving average (blue line) and on Wednesday closing at a new all-time high. That high was extended on Thursday, again with extremely high volume. However, two back-to-back high-volume days are often the sign of institutions’ covering of short-sales. If I am correct, the stock could pull back and attempt to close the open gap, the mid-point of which is about $132. Thus, buyers should wait to see if new money can drive the stock higher, or the lack of short-covering drops the stock to the open gap at $131 to $132.50. Either way ITA should be purchased as a long-term hold.

Lawmakers of three main opposition parties raised a flurry of questions about Choi's involvement in important state affairs, including the US missile shield deployment decision, while none of ruling Saenuri Party members requested an inquiry. Ahn Min-seok of the main opposition Minjoo Party inquired Defence Minister Han Min-koo about whether the defence chief was informed of the contacts of Jeong Yoon-hoe, Choi's ex-husband, with arms lobbyist Linda Kim and the Lockheed Martin side. Lockheed Martin is a manufacturer of Terminal High Altitude Area Defence (THAAD), a US missile defence system which South Korea agreed in July with the United States to deploy in its soil by the end of next year. It was a surprising decision given that Seoul had refrained from the issue and seemingly felt uncomfortable with even mentioning it. Choi, whose friendship with President Park dates back to the mid-1970s, had maintained an acquaintance with the arms lobbyist at least since 2000, according to Joongang Ilbo newspaper. The lobbyist was detained in October for drug-administering charges. Some of local media outlets and opposition lawmakers speculated that Choi may have engaged in South Korea's weapons procurement projects as well as the THAAD deployment decision. Boeing's F-15 Silent Eagles were supposed to be selected as South Korea's next-generation fighter jets in 2013, but the widespread expectation was overturned in September of the year as the defence ministry's arms procurement committee voted it down. About two months later, Lockheed Martin's F-35 fighter jets were offered as a sole candidate and finally picked to replace South Korea's decrepit combat planes. President Park took office in February 2013. Chung Dong-young of the minor People's Party claimed that the defence minister was excluded from the THAAD installation decision and that his claim is sufficient to make President Park impeached. Chung asked Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn about how to think about Choi's involvement in the decision to shut down Kaesong Industrial Complex. In response, the prime minister said he had not heard of the private citizen's engagement. The inter-Korean factory park in Kaesong, the border town of North Korea, was closed down by South Korea following the North's fourth nuclear detonation in January and the launch in February of a long-range rocket. Choi, a private citizen who has no public position, is suspected of deeply meddling in government affairs, ranging from selecting wardrobe to be worn by the president in official events to the editing of presidential speeches and the appointment of cabinet members. Allegations include decisions on the shutdown of the last remaining symbol of inter-Korean economic cooperation, THAAD deployment and the state-authored history textbook that sparked concerns that new textbooks may beautify military dictatorships and the Japanese colonisation of the Korean peninsula. Meanwhile, South Korea is pushing a hush-hush military intelligence pact with Japan after a botched attempt four years ago, as public attention is being centered on the political scandal. Seoul's defence ministry said the two countries would initial the accord next week in Tokyo to share military intelligence on North Korea's nuclear and missile programmes. If internal procedures are passed smoothly, the deal is forecast to be formally signed in late November. Former President Lee Myung-bak sought the pact in 2012, but it failed at the last minutes amid a public outcry over the hurried, closed-door deal without any social consensus and parliamentary consultations. Many South Koreans still see such a deal with Japan as unacceptable as the Japanese leadership has yet to sincerely apologise for its militaristic history. The country was colonised by the Imperial Japan between 1910 and 1945. The main opposition party said Thursday that it will propose the resignation of the defence minister if the push for the military pact with Japan continues in defiance of oppositions from the public and the parliament. -- BERNAMA >> Newslist Previous Top Stories Flash Floods Hit Klang Valley, Putrajaya 1MDB Highly Politicised By Certain People For Own Political Benefit - Najib With Or Without TPP Malaysia Committed To Strengthen Ties With US, Says Najib Other News Headlines Avoid Poor Jokes Syndrome At UMNO General Assembly 2016 - Analysts- politic Malaysian Franchise Industry Flourishing Amid Challenging Economy - Hamzah- business Syria, Iran Draw 0-0 In 2018 World Cup Qualifying Round- sports Malays Need To Relearn Their Culture- features Egypt Court Overturns Morsi Death Sentence, Orders Retrial- world Most Read News Avoid Poor Jokes Syndrome At UMNO General Assembly 2016 - Analysts Flash Floods Hit Klang Valley, Putrajaya No Excuse For Inaction On Global Warming, Warns Malaysia Home | Sitemap | Contact Us | General | Politics | Business | Sports | Features | World | Full News List | Archived News | RSS Feeds © 2016 BERNAMA.

Photo: Michael Macor, The Chronicle Buy this photo Trump's trade policies could hurt West Coast jobs in a big way 1 / 4 Back to Gallery President-elect Donald Trump has made a lot of threats regarding foreign trade. In the course of his campaign, Trump said he would renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), enact steep tariffs against China and Mexico, and possibly even pull out of the World Trade Organization, among other things. But if he were to follow through on those promises, the U.S. would likely face a trade war that would hit California and Washington hard in the labor market, as well as impacting the rest of the U.S. economy, according to a September analysis by the Peterson Institute for International Economics (PIIE). In California, San Mateo and San Francisco counties would be hit hardest in the business-services sector, while Alameda and Santa Clara counties would be hit hard in at least one specific sector. Washington state, under a full trade-war scenario, could expect to lose more than 5 percent of its jobs -- at least 170,000 jobs and the highest percentage in the nation -- the analysis found. The fact that the trade organization analyzed Trump's and Hillary Clinton's trade policies at all is something of a rarity in itself. "Since international economic policy has largely been an area of continuity and bipartisanship, at least since World War II, there has not been the need to examine trade in previous elections," the authors wrote in the PIIE analysis. "In this election, however, the need is pressing for an unbiased, transparent, and evidence-based analysis." The report noted that both Trump's and Clinton's trade policies could have negative impacts on the American economy, but Clinton's policies would have had mild impacts compared to the potential to incite a trade war and drive a recession from Trump's policies. A trade war would be anything but good for the U.S. "Enormous economic damage to U.S. firms, workers, and communities could ensue from a trade war long before the legal battlefield is cleared," the authors wrote. "It would be a mistake to suppose that the US courts will intervene to stop a trade war." Though many of Trump's proposals would likely be legal initially, opponents would likely challenge them in Congress and in the courts. But it would take several years before either body of government could -- if at all -- reverse his policies, the analysis found. "U.S. citizens and firms should not rely on the U.S. courts or Congress to shield them from the consequences of Trump's threats, should he carry them out," it read. A trade war could take many shapes, but an "asymmetrical" trade war -- if other nations retaliated more harshly than just with steep tariffs -- could have more sweeping impacts that would also be harder to overcome. China, for example, could end imports of U.S. aircraft, hitting Boeing disproportionately hard as China picks up a major share of Boeing's sales.  The Seattle metro area could lose 31,000 jobs -- 2 percent of private employment -- due to Boeing cuts, according to the analysis. China could also end its use of U.S. business services, cutting another 4,000 King County jobs, the report found. Any legal challenges would take years to complete, possibly longer than Trump's time in office. The results could be grim at best. "The analysis presented here shows that the trade war these policies is likely to spark would send the U.S. economy into a recession and cost millions of Americans their jobs," the report read. "His (Trump's) policies place at risk the livelihoods of millions of Americans, most of whom probably do not think of their jobs as tied to international trade. The American casualties in this trade war would be drawn disproportionately from the ranks of lower-income and lower-skilled workers."

He will not serve fried chicken and taco bowl salads at state dinners. (Though his first honoured guest would surely be Vladimir Putin.) Marla Maples (right), Trump’s second wife from 1993 to 1999. GETTY Nor will he attempt to install a casino in the East Wing, replace the annual Easter Egg Roll with the annual Easter Roulette dice roll, or dig a tunnel to his nearby, brand new hotel on Pennsylvania Avenue. The possibility of an inauguration day next January involving Mr Trump taking the Oath of Office is surely already giving the 96 full-time and 250 part-time custodial staff at the mansion conniptions. How do you transform in two hours its 132 rooms - it is big - to accommodate the tastes of a former reality television host when the man leaving is understated Barack Obama? Then there will be the Trumps themselves. While the immediate family is large, especially if you include two ex-wives, it is likely that only three of them will actually be moving in to live there - President Donald Trump, First Lady Melania and their son, 10-year-old Barron. Slovenian-born Melania (46) should give the old place a bit of high-glam glitz. She was a model once. Come to think of it, which of the Trump women weren't on the runway earlier in their lives? Ivanka, the daughter born to Mr Trump and his first wife, Ivana, was a model before she joined the Trump enterprises as president of development and acquisitions. She can now boast of having helped him acquire America. Such are her good looks her father has been known to make off-colour remarks about them. Ivana Zelnickova, Trump’s first wife from 1977 to 1992 and who is mother to Eric, Donald, and Ivanka. REUTERS/Eric Gaillard...I In a 2003 Howard Stern radio interview, he averred that his eldest daughter has "got the best body". Likewise, during an appearance on ABC's 'The View' in 2006, he said that if Ivanka wasn't his daughter he would be dating her. Arguably, the most appealing of the Trump offspring, Ivanka would surely be a regular visitor to Washington. And she has her own brood. This summer she had her third child with husband Jared Kushner - she converted to Judaism after marrying him in 2009. Mr Kushner (never a model) is the son of a prominent New York property developer and has been owner of the weekly 'Observer' paper in New York for 10 years. Also prominent in the campaign and certain to claim some right to hang at the White House is Donald Trump Jr (38), first son of Donald and Ivana. His wife, Vanessa, was a model, once signed with Wilhelmina Models. According to New York Magazine, she also dated Leonardo DiCaprio when she was 20. They have given Donald no fewer than five grandchildren. Donald Jr has made a few gaffes of his own in the heat of the campaign, like the day he compared sweets to refugees. "If I had a bowl of Skittles and I told you just three would kill you. Would you take a handful?" he wrote on Twitter. "That's our Syria refugee problem." Then there is Eric Trump, who was a campaign fixture. Like his elder brother, he likes to shoot large animals like bears and lions in Africa. There is one famous snap of him posing with a severed elephant's tail. Not a former model exactly, Eric's wife of two years, Lara - they wed at Mar-a-Lago, the Trump spread in Palm Beach that could serve as the Winter White House - is, however, a former personal trainer. Tiffany Trump (22), the daughter of Donald and his second wife Marla Maples (nee Cuhutta Georgia), recently graduated from University of Pennsylvania and wants to be - a model. She made her New York Fashion Week debut in February this year. Young Barron, as far as we know, has no modelling aspirations. He is fan of sports, especially tennis, and, we are told, golf. Should he require a diminutive but challenging golf course within the boundaries of the White House - perhaps across the South lawn where Michelle Obama currently has her vegetable garden - his father should be able to deliver. Building golf courses is something he has done before.

Bombardier Advertisement Bombardier Inc. (IW 1000/220) surged the most in six months after forecasting annual profit at the high end of its previous outlook as the maker of the much-delayed C Series jetliner slowed the rate at which it had been burning through funds. Higher operating cash flow and reduced investment following certification of the CS100 and CS300 models of the marquee aircraft are driving the improvements, the Montreal-based company said in a statement Thursday. Earnings before interest, taxes and special items this year will be $350 million to $400 million, compared with a previous forecast of $200 million to $400 million, Bombardier said. “We are gaining confidence in Bombardier’s ability to meet its long-term margin targets,” Cam Doerksen, an analyst at National Bank Financial in Montreal, said in a note to clients. Popular Now More 'Must Have' Metrics to Drive Continuous Improvement How to Reduce Costs through Supply Chain Network Optimization Trump is Right on Trade, But He Doesn’t Know Why The results suggested that Chief Executive Officer Alain Bellemare is finally making headway in overcoming cost overruns and a delay of more than two years on the all-new $6 billion C Series, a model intended to compete with planes from Boeing Co. and Airbus Group SE. Bellemare, who was hired in February 2015 with a mandate to restore profit, announced this year’s second round of major job cuts in October. The widely traded Class B shares climbed 5.6% to C$1.88 at 11:49 a.m. in Toronto Thursday after earlier advancing as much as 7.9%, the biggest intraday gain since April 28. Bombardier, which also makes trains, advanced 33% this year through Wednesday, more than twice the 13% gain of Canada’s benchmark S&P/TSX Composite Index. Turnaround Plan Makes Progress Bellemare unveiled plans three weeks ago to cut 7,500 jobs, saying they were needed to ensure competitiveness and improve profit margins. Both rounds are likely to save $500 million to $600 million a year by the end of 2018, executives said on a conference call Thursday. The company is about 80% through its February drive to cut 7,000 jobs, Bellemare said. “We’re executing on every single piece of our turnaround plan,” Bellemare said Thursday in an interview. “We are largely done de-risking the company.” Related Shrinking Demand for Private Jets Adds to Bombardier's Challenges Bombardier Cuts 7,000 Jobs Now that the C Series is in service, Bombardier has one development program left, the Global 7000 business jet, he said. “And we are focused on that. We have this thing under control.” Bombardier will provide more details on its financial goals for 2017 at a Dec. 15 investor day in New York. “Management’s cost transformation initiatives are taking hold and we believe investor confidence will continue to improve as this management team executes and delivers on its targets,” Walter Spracklin, an RBC Capital Markets analyst, said in a note to clients. This $73 million Bombardier jet just completed its first test flight https://t.co/omvDKiDnis pic.twitter.com/V0yqsBT6vO— CNN (@CNN) November 5, 2016 Bombardier expects to generate free cash flow in the fourth quarter, meaning it’s likely to end the year with about $3.5 billion in cash on hand and available liquidity of about $4.5 billion, Chief Financial Officer John Di Bert said in the interview with Bellemare. “We’ve improved our liquidity, and we are well-positioned for refinancing” debt that matures in 2018, he said. The company has $1.4 billion of bonds coming due that year. Bombardier had about $9 billion of long-term debt as of Sept. 30 and $4.4 billion of accessible liquidity, after Quebec injected $1 billion for a 49.5 percent stake in the C Series program. The manufacturer spent $320 million of its free cash in the third quarter, compared with $816 million a year earlier. Analysts watch the liquidity figure closely as Bombardier works through costs for programs such as the C Series and the Global 7000. Bombardier has predicted it will start generating free cash flow in 2018. ‘Future Profitability’ Bombardier posted an adjusted loss of $10 million in the third quarter, essentially breaking even on a per-share basis. Analysts had expected a 3 cent loss, according to the average of estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Revenue dropped 9.7% to $3.74 billion, while analysts predicted $3.95 billion. The third-quarter performance “suggests Bombardier’s underlying cost restructuring actions are on or ahead of plan, potentially positioning the company for better-than-expected future profitability as volumes begin to build for the C Series and Global” jets, Nick Heymann, an analyst at William Blair & Co., said in a note to clients. Full-year revenue will be about $16.5 billion, at the low end of the company’s forecast range, while Bombardier maintained its outlook for cash-flow use at $1.15 billion to $1.45 billion. In the rail business, earnings before interest and taxes will exceed 6.5% of sales this year, up from a previous goal of more than 6%, Bombardier said. Profit in the business-jet unit is expected to be stronger than the previous outlook of about 6% of sales. Bombardier said its loss in commercial aircraft will be $100 million less than the $550 million previously forecast. In September, it slashed its 2016 forecast for deliveries of the C Series, saying delays in shipments of Pratt & Whitney engines would cause the planemaker to burn through cash more quickly than expected. Seven of the new aircraft are now slated to be handed over this year instead of the 15 previously planned. Last week, Bombardier flew its Global 7000 business jet the first time, a milestone for the delayed aircraft that puts the company on track to begin deliveries in 2018. The $72.8 million jet remains on track to make its commercial debut in the second half of 2018. By Frederic Tomesco Print reprints Favorite EMAIL Tweet Please Log In or Register to post comments.

Aurora's work on the Autonomous Aerial Cargo Utility System (AACUS) program will be leveraged to integrate the company's Tactical Autonomous Aerial Logistics System (TALOS) on a UH-1H helicopter. The primary goal of the AACUS program is to enable rapid cargo delivery by unmanned, and potentially optionally-manned, VTOL systems. AACUS encompasses the development and implementation of VTOL-based obstacle detection and avoidance, and allows for autonomous landings at unprepared, off-field, non-cooperative landing sites. AACUS also enables dynamic contingency planning to the point of landing, with goal-based supervisory control by any field personnel with no special training. At the AACUS flight testing event held today in Northern Virginia, the AACUS program demonstrated on a manned Bell 206 the perception and planning capabilities required for autonomous takeoff, transit and landing. "We know how to make things fly, we've been doing it for over 100 years," said Retired Brig. Gen. Frank Kelley, the Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Navy for Unmanned Systems. "What we don't yet know how to do, is how to couple aircraft and autonomous systems together, but great programs like this are helping us get there." Aurora's TALOS system has been demonstrated previously on a Boeing H-6U Unmanned Little Bird flown autonomously, and three different human-piloted Bell 206 aircraft. "The arrival of a Huey as our third test platform frames a key point for future customers – the TALOS system is platform agnostic; you're not buying a new fleet of helicopters, you're buying a capability set for your current fleet," said John Wissler, Vice President of Aurora's R&D Center in Cambridge, Massachusetts. "TALOS is not an aircraft, nor is it a robot flying an aircraft –TALOS is transferable intelligence designed with both manned and unmanned aircraft requirements in mind. The value of TALOS can be described in a few words – platform agnostic, scalable autonomy, onboard sensing of the environment, and on-board intelligence that no other system in the world can provide." Commercial applications for the TALOS technology are also being explored by Aurora. "Think of the civilian first responder pilot attempting to land in a remote, storm-ravaged area at night – TALOS senses and alerts to power lines and landing zone obstacles well before the pilot and informs the pilot's maneuvers," said Wissler. The final phase of the AACUS program will transition the TALOS system onto an autonomous UH-1H platform currently under development at Aurora, with culminating demonstrations occurring in 2017-2018. Aurora's TALOS system is being developed for the AACUS program with funding from the Office of Naval Research. To learn more about TALOS, visit www.aurora.aero/aacus.

American has more than 1,100 aircraft with Wi-Fi service, a number the airline said gives it one of the largest Wi-Fi-equipped fleets in the world. ViaSat's largest North American customer to date is JetBlue Airways Corp., which provides the service to passengers for free through a marketing partnership with Amazon.com Inc. In June, the world's largest airline split an order between the two Wi-Fi providers, with ViaSat contracted for service on 100 new Boeing 737 Max planes and Gogo tapped to install its new 2Ku satellite service on more than 130 Airbus A319s and A320s. The ViaSat installations begin in the summer of 2017, while the Gogo additions will begin late next year, American Airlines spokeswoman Martha Thomas said Wednesday. In early June, Chicago-based Gogo told investors that about 550 American planes with its equipment "are subject to deinstallation at any time at American's option." Gogo also said it expected that American would exercise that right for many, or perhaps all, of those aircraft "from time to time over the next several years." ViaSat disclosed a large new order with its quarterly earnings report Nov. 8 but declined to reveal which airline, per the customer's request. Carlsbad, Calif.-based ViaSat operates its own satellites, while Gogo and Global Eagle Entertainment Inc. contract with other satellite companies. "Gogo will still be outfitting other aircraft in our domestic fleet with its 2ku satellite Wi-Fi and Panasonic continues to provide satellite Wi-Fi for our international widebody fleet," Thomas said, adding: "Gogo remains a valued partner." American uses Panasonic Aviation on more than 60 of its international wide-body aircraft. Gogo spokesman Steve Nolan said in an e-mail Wednesday that American's announcement is "really old news and confirms what we said in our June 3 public statement. It doesn't change our business outlook and financial guidance." Separately, Southwest said late Tuesday that it's reviewing proposals for a "secondary connectivity provider" to the Row 44 service it has from Global Eagle on its fleet of more than 700 Boeing 737s. Southwest is Global Eagle's largest customer. The airline said it would have "more to share in the coming weeks," spokeswoman Michelle Agnew said Tuesday. Southwest hasn't revealed which companies it's reviewing for the second service or how much of its fleet would be covered. Shares of Global Eagle fell more than 12 percent to $7.17 in New York trading. Gogo fell almost 8 percent to $8.91, while ViaSat rose more than 11 percent to $78.45. --Justin Bachman and Mary Schlangenstein, Bloomberg View Comments Tags American Airlines Airlines Business Share Facebook Twitter Email Print This Story Get the Most Important D-FW News in Your Inbox Sign up for our daily email newsletters Get Headlines, Business, SportsDay, and GuideLive.

Higher operating cash flow and reduced investment following certification of the CS100 and CS300 models of the marquee aircraft are driving the improvements, the Montreal-based company said in a statement Thursday. Earnings before interest, taxes and special items this year will be $350 million to $400 million, compared with a previous forecast of $200 million to $400 million, Bombardier said. “We are gaining confidence in Bombardier’s ability to meet its long-term margin targets,” Cam Doerksen, an analyst at National Bank Financial in Montreal, said in a note to clients. The results suggested that Chief Executive Officer Alain Bellemare is finally making headway in overcoming cost overruns and a delay of more than two years on the all-new $6 billion C Series, a model intended to compete with planes from Boeing Co. and Airbus Group SE. Bellemare, who was hired in February 2015 with a mandate to restore profit, announced this year’s second round of major job cuts in October. The widely traded Class B shares climbed 5.6 percent to C$1.88 at 11:49 a.m. in Toronto Thursday after earlier advancing as much as 7.9 percent, the biggest intraday gain since April 28. Bombardier, which also makes trains, advanced 33 percent this year through Wednesday, more than twice the 13 percent gain of Canada’s benchmark S&P/TSX Composite Index. Job Cuts Bellemare unveiled plans three weeks ago to cut 7,500 jobs, saying they were needed to ensure competitiveness and improve profit margins. Both rounds are likely to save $500 million to $600 million a year by the end of 2018, executives said on a conference call Thursday. The company is about 80 percent through its February drive to cut 7,000 jobs, Bellemare said. “We’re executing on every single piece of our turnaround plan,” Bellemare said Thursday in an interview. “We are largely done de-risking the company.” Now that the C Series is in service, Bombardier has one development program left, the Global 7000 business jet, he said. “And we are focused on that. We have this thing under control.” Bombardier will provide more details on its financial goals for 2017 at a Dec. 15 investor day in New York. “Management’s cost transformation initiatives are taking hold and we believe investor confidence will continue to improve as this management team executes and delivers on its targets,” Walter Spracklin, an RBC Capital Markets analyst, said in a note to clients. Cash Flow Bombardier expects to generate free cash flow in the fourth quarter, meaning it’s likely to end the year with about $3.5 billion in cash on hand and available liquidity of about $4.5 billion, Chief Financial Officer John Di Bert said in the interview with Bellemare. “We’ve improved our liquidity, and we are well-positioned for refinancing” debt that matures in 2018, he said. The company has $1.4 billion of bonds coming due that year. Bombardier had about $9 billion of long-term debt as of Sept. 30 and $4.4 billion of accessible liquidity, after Quebec injected $1 billion for a 49.5 percent stake in the C Series program. The manufacturer spent $320 million of its free cash in the third quarter, compared with $816 million a year earlier. Analysts watch the liquidity figure closely as Bombardier works through costs for programs such as the C Series and the Global 7000. Bombardier has predicted it will start generating free cash flow in 2018. ‘Future Profitability’ Bombardier posted an adjusted loss of $10 million in the third quarter, essentially breaking even on a per-share basis. Analysts had expected a 3 cent loss, according to the average of estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Revenue dropped 9.7 percent to $3.74 billion, while analysts predicted $3.95 billion. The third-quarter performance “suggests Bombardier’s underlying cost restructuring actions are on or ahead of plan, potentially positioning the company for better-than-expected future profitability as volumes begin to build for the C Series and Global” jets, Nick Heymann, an analyst at William Blair & Co., said in a note to clients. Full-year revenue will be about $16.5 billion, at the low end of the company’s forecast range, while Bombardier maintained its outlook for cash-flow use at $1.15 billion to $1.45 billion. In the rail business, earnings before interest and taxes will exceed 6.5 percent of sales this year, up from a previous goal of more than 6 percent, Bombardier said. Profit in the business-jet unit is expected to be stronger than the previous outlook of about 6 percent of sales. Maiden Voyage Bombardier said its loss in commercial aircraft will be $100 million less than the $550 million previously forecast. In September, it slashed its 2016 forecast for deliveries of the C Series, saying delays in shipments of Pratt & Whitney engines would cause the planemaker to burn through cash more quickly than expected. Seven of the new aircraft are now slated to be handed over this year instead of the 15 previously planned. Last week, Bombardier flew its Global 7000 business jet the first time, a milestone for the delayed aircraft that puts the company on track to begin deliveries in 2018. The $72.8 million jet remains on track to make its commercial debut in the second half of 2018. (An earlier version of this story corrected the amount of the adjusted loss.)

It’s hard to say. There are so many uncertainties, particularly when it comes to how he sees the world and how his policies may affect the multi-billion defense industry. Here are four questions about how he would handle the world’s largest defense industry. Q: Who does Trump pick as secretary of defense? A: If Hillary Clinton won, many in Washington thought that Michele Flournoy, the chief executive of the think tank Center for New American Security, would get the top job. She’s well known inside the beltway, having served as the under secretary of defense for policy from 2009 to 2012, while also serving in the Pentagon in the mid-1990s. Under Trump, it’s not clear who he’ll appoint. As a businessman who ran against the Washington establishment, some think he could bring an outsider to shake up the world’s largest bureaucracy, with 3 million people on the payroll. Mackenzie Eaglen, a defense analyst with the American Entterprise Institute who briefed the Trump campaign three times, said she urged against picking an outsider. “It’s much harder to make work given the sheer size of the Defense Department,” she said. “You don’t need someone who has to spend the first 12 months learning the acronyms.” Q: Trump says he wants to rebuild the military. What will that look like? A: Trump has said he wants to increase the size of the Army and the Marine Corps, build new ships for the Navy and add jets to the Air Force’s arsenal and modernize the nuclear arsenal. Defense stocks jumped Wednesday morning with news of his election. BAE System and Raytheon saw their stock prices go up more than 6 percent by 11 a.m. Wednesday. Lockheed Martin was up more than 5 percent. “Trump’s win is good news for the defense industry, especially when coupled with Republican majorities in the House and Senate,” said Loren Thompson, a defense consultant who advises many of the nation’s top tier contractors. Increasing the size of the military will favor BAE Systems and General Dynamics, plus helicopter makers Boeing and Lockheed Martin, in particular, he said. Northrop Grumman, which is building the Air Force’s new bomber, could be a winner, he said, as could General Dynamics and Huntington Ingalls, companies that make submarines. Trump would most likely focus on weapons systems already in development or production, instead of starting new ones, Eaglen said, which would be good news for programs such as the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle, the Littoral Combat Ship as well as building new aircraft carriers. Q: All of that sounds costly. Where does he get the money? A: Eaglen has calculated that his promises could add up to an additional $55 billion in defense spending-”and that’s conservative,” she said. Trump has called to eliminate the budget caps that control defense spending, while also rooting out waste in the Pentagon’s budget, as he plans to disrupt Washington’s traditional ways of doing business. Some of the Pentagon’s main programs, many of which have suffered years of cost overruns and schedule delays, could be targeted, as well as the large defense corporations behind them. In a note to investors, Byron Callan, an analyst with Alpha Security Partners, “A populist president may be less tolerant of cost overruns on major weapons systems and greater use of fixed-price contracts might entail more risk for the sector.” Eaglen acknowledged that “the major defense contractors are part of the establishment he’s railing against.” But she said Trump doesn’t really have a choice but to stick with them. “If he wants to show results, he’s got to live with the contractors he has,” she said. “You have to go with the production lines you have open.” Trump’s ability to work with Congress will also be a huge factor. While the GOP has majorities in the House and Senate, they are narrow. And conservative Republicans may clash with defense hawks over spending-touching off intra-party budget battles, said Todd Harrison an analyst with the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “Many of those Republicans don’t support Trump or his policies,” he said. “I think it means continued and perhaps even worse gridlock.” Q: What happens to the Pentagon’s initiatives to reach out beyond its traditional industry base to harness innovation and technology from places like Silicon Valley? A: Under President Barack Obama, the Pentagon has launched a series of initiatives designed to harness innovation and partner with Silicon Valley firms. Known as the “third offset strategy” the plans would help the U.S. military hold on to its technological advantage over potential adversaries such as Russia and China. But under Trump those initiatives could be imperiled, Harrison said. Trump would likely bring in “a totally new team of civilian leaders with completely new priorities.” Eaglen said, though, that those programs are a relatively small portion of the budget, and that it is vital to invest in technology at a time when it is moving so fast. “We have lost our technological supremacy,” she said. “He would be crazy to abandon that.” Related content LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story Military News Comments Videos facebook twitter email Share More Videos 1:14 Veterans Day tribute at Veterans Memorial Monument Pause 2:06 Children's choir performs at Veterans Day ceremony 0:59 Mabus credits America's shipbuilders for a better Navy 1:14 Navy Sec.

Mark West · Nov. 10, 2016 Tweet As I peer out the window at the terrain below, jetting over the heartland of America, I cannot help but ponder the future for our nation following the unexpected and historical win by Donald Trump. We saw so many “firsts” during Election 2016. The first billionaire to win the presidency. The first woman to ever receive the nomination for president of a major party. The first election where both candidates' unfavorable ratings were at historical highs. And so many more. Today I am indeed grateful to God that we are not referring to Hillary Clinton as president-elect. If you believe that God is still intimately engaged in His creation, then you understand that Daniel 2:21 was once again affirmed in this election in which we were all given the privilege and responsibility to participate: “And He changes the times and seasons; He removes kings and raise up kings.” While I am thankful that Hillary Clinton did not prevail, admittedly I remain a skeptic as to Trump’s veracity, trustworthiness and character. My concerns will either be affirmed or invalidated in the months and years to come. And honestly I pray they are proven wrong. But one thing is certain. As Donald Trump transitions from candidate to president, some very distinct realities will set in. If you’ve ever flown, as I am doing today, you know that there can be something magical about soaring 30,000 feet above the earth at 600+ MPH, seeing the earth below you whiz by. The details of all that lies below is indistinguishable from that altitude. Similarly though, if one is glancing up from the ground into the atmosphere, the specifics of an aircraft is also unknown. What airline is it? What is its tail number? Is it a Boeing or Airbus? Who is inside? There’s no telling until the plane lands. But when that silver capsule finally touches down, the answers will become clear. If there are defects in the plane, they will be exposed. And as the passengers disembark, their true identity will be revealed. Over the last year, the Trump campaign has been like the jet cruising at 30,000 feet. Its flight plan has been purposefully one of generalities with limited substance dealing in poll-tested, populist issues. But to an angry and disgusted populace, the vague flight plan proved wildly popular, with statements like these fueling Trump’s flight: “I will build a great wall on our southern border and I will make Mexico pay for that wall. Mark my words!” “Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the US until our country’s representatives can figure out what is going on.” (Interestingly this statement was removed from Trump’s website 11/09/16, the day after his election. See here.) “I’m going to repeal and replace Obamacare.” “We’re going to have a special prosecutor for Hillary. If I were president, Hillary would already be in jail.” But the Trump campaign is now descending from its year-long high altitude voyage to the reality of a Trump administration. As the implementation of the billionaire’s vision proceeds, which was strong on emotionally charged rhetoric but soft on specifics, any blemishes in Trump’s policies and flaws in his style and guiding philosophies will quickly be tested and revealed. Fortunately for Trump, he is landing his presidency on a “Republican-friendly” runway, given the reality that our new president will be advantaged with a GOP-controlled Senate and House. And while there are many Republicans in Congress who are not fans of Donald, the way in which Trump won will give him the gravitas that many of his predecessors lacked. So will president-elect Donald Trump touch down in Washington prepared to govern and deliver specific solutions that are as popular and successful as his campaign rhetoric was in its lacking of those same specifics? Can the reality TV star be accountable to voters to follow through in the drudgery of day-to-day governing? Will Trump’s decisions over the next four years remain in alignment with the positions he claimed he supported during his campaign? Or will President Trump revert back to the antithetical views and values he embraced during the many decades leading up to his Republican “conversion”? Will the dozens of campaign promises Trump made, many outrageous in nature, be fulfilled? And if not, will his supporters even care? The answers to these questions will determine whether President Trump’s arrival and tenure in Washington will be a successful and controlled touch down or a disastrous crash landing. For the sake of our nation, our communities and our loved ones, I pray our new president is not only wildly successful, both politically and personally, but that the man who disembarks in Washington is a man of great character and integrity. “What will it profit a man if he gains the whole world and loses his soul?” —Mark 8:36 Republished from Awake to Freedom.

Rich Smith (TMFDitty) Nov 10, 2016 at 10:41AM President-elect Trump ran on a promise to "make America great again." In one respect, his election on Tuesday is already turning out to be great news for investors in defense stocks. This morning, analysts at Barclays Capital reacted to news of the Trump win with a series of new upgrades for defense stocks. Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT), L-3 Communications (NYSE:LLL), Northrop Grumman (NYSE:NOC) -- tic-tac-toe, three-in-a-row, Barclays upgraded each and every one. But which of these defense stocks does Barclays like best? And in light of their widely varying valuations, which of these stocks should you like best for your portfolio? (And is there an even better option that Barclays might be missing?) That's what we're here to find out. Let's begin. Image source: Donald J. Trump for President. From least to greatest: Lockheed Martin Let's start with the stock Barclays likes least: Lockheed Martin. The nation's biggest pure-play defense contractor by revenue, S&P Global Market Intelligence reports that Lockheed Martin did $50.6 billion in business over the last 12 months, and earned $5.2 billion in profits on that business. That works out to a very respectable 10.4% net profit margin, and makes Lockheed Martin nearly twice as profitable (per revenue dollar) as it was five years ago. Lockheed Martin stock seems inexpensive at just 14.1 times earnings. With a growth rate currently estimated at just 8.2% annualized over the next five years, it's not the best bargain on the market, and Barclays rates the stock only equal weight. Even so, in light of the Trump victory, the analyst has upgraded the stock from its old rating of underweight, and added $30 to its price target -- to $275 a share. A "100% likelihood" to benefit? L-3 Communications What leads Barclays to think Lockheed, and these other stocks as well, will benefit? As explained in a write-up on TheFly.com today, Barclays believes "the market will assign a 100% likelihood of higher near-term defense spending under a Trump administration." This belief is enough to convince the analyst to upgrade L-3 Communications as well, and this time it's going all the way to an overweight rating, with a price target set at $165. Curiously, though, while L-3 gets a higher rating from Barclays, most analysts see its growth prospects as slightly inferior to Lockheed's. Consensus estimates call for only 7.9% growth at L-3 over the next five years, and with L-3 shares already trading for more than 32 times trailing earnings, that would appear to make L-3 stock a riskier bet. Top o' the heap: Northrop Grumman? Perhaps the single stock Barclays likes best is Northrop Grumman -- but it's hard to imagine why. At 20 times trailing earnings, Northrop is not the most expensive stock in the defense space, but neither is it the cheapest. Northrop's 1.5% dividend yield is less than the 1.9% that L-3 pays, and barely half of Lockheed Martin's beefy 2.9% payout. In fact, the one thing that Northrop does seem to have going in its favor is the fact that analysts were expecting it to outgrow its rivals. Consensus estimates were calling for 9.2% long-term earnings growth at Northrop Grumman -- and that was before Trump won the election. Is there a better way to profit from a Trump presidency? Barclays rates Northrop Grumman stock overweight,q just as it does L-3 Communications. Moreover, the $270 price target it assigns to Northrop Grumman stock implies similar upside for both stocks -- about 11% from current prices. But if you ask me, there's an even bigger opportunity in defense stocks than any of the three Barclays names: Boeing (NYSE:BA). With a smaller defense business than Lockheed's, Boeing's large commercial aircraft arm makes it a bigger company overall. In fact, at $94.8 billion in annual sales, Boeing is nearly twice the size of Lockheed by revenues (and pays an even bigger dividend -- 3%). Valued on GAAP earnings, Boeing stock looks similar to Northrop's, with a P/E ratio of 20.9. But Boeing has such strong cash production that, at last report, the stock was selling for less than 11 times annual free cash flow. At the same time, its 15.5% projected profits growth rate dwarfs those of the aerospace and defense rivals that Barclays endorsed today -- and gives Boeing stock a PEG ratio that looks downright cheap at just 0.7. All things considered, while I don't disagree with Barclays' major thesis that defense stocks will benefit from a Trump presidency, I fear the analyst may be overlooking the best stock of the bunch: Boeing.

Defence Secretary Sir Michael Fallon with his Norwegian counterpart, Ine Marie Eriksen Søreide, outside Norway's Joint Headquarters, Bodø. Credit: Norwegian Armed Forces Sir Michael, who visited Norway’s top military headquarters, close to the Arctic Circle on Thursday, announced that the UK and Norway would work closer on Maritime Patrol Aircraft cooperation, including in reducing costs and increasing operational effectiveness. The UK announced that it would procure nine Boeing P8 MPA in last year’s Strategic Defence and Security Review. The new capability, which will be based in Scotland, will allow for enhanced situational awareness in key areas such as the North Atlantic, and will also further increase the protection of the UK’s nuclear deterrent and our two new aircraft carriers. Sir Michael also visited Norway’s Bodø Main Air Station, home of two F-16 squadrons and a squadron of Search and Rescue Sea King helicopters, where he signed a new agreement on host nation support for UK exercises in the country, further increasing the UK and Norway’s ability to exercise, train and operate together. Mr Fallon welcomed the fact that British armed forces undertake yearly winter training in Norway, particularly 3 Commando Brigade in Harstad and Evenes and elements of Joint Helicopter Command at Bardufoss. Defence Secretary Sir Michael Fallon said: Britain needs Maritime Patrol Aircraft to keep watch over the seas. As part of our £178 billion defence equipment programme, we’ve committed to new maritime patrol aircraft that are able to monitor threats to Britain and our armed forces. By stepping up cooperation with Norway on maritime patrol, we will help keep Britain safer and more secure. The Defence Secretary boards a Norwegian Maritime Patrol Aircraft with his counterpart, Ine Marie Eriksen Søreide. Credit: Norwegian Armed Forces The Defence Secretary arrived in Norway following meetings with the Northern Group countries on Wednesday in Copenhagen, where he reaffirmed the UK’s commitment to European defence. As part of this, the Defence Secretary announced that 5 Battalion The Rifles would lead the UK’s battalion in Estonia next year, part of NATO’s Enhanced Forward Presence in the East. Work on the UK’s MPA programme is progressing well, including the investment on infrastructure in Lossiemouth in Scotland, where the planes will be based. Former armed forces personnel who previously served on UK Nimrod are also re-joining the RAF to help operate the future P-8s. 12 have recently re-joined and more will re-join in the future.

I'm not sure even President-elect Donald Trump has yet figured out exactly what he will be, other than "great" and "powerful." But a lengthy list of election winners and losers already has formed, and it's growing longer by the hour. It's prompted not only by the shift in national politics, but also by a change underway in Illinois that, depending on what happens in 2018, could be just as decisive. Among the items: trade, Obamacare, abortion rights and transportation. And the political influence of our state and city. First, the biggest winner: American democracy. Yes, I think our democracy was hurt by some of the shenanigans in this election, particularly signs of Russian influence via leaked emails and hacking. That ought to petrify every voter. And yes, some of my Democratic pals will shun the notion that anything good could come out of electing Trump. To them, I reply: That's democracy. Everyone has their say, the people decide and power changes hands peacefully. Then you wait for the politicians in charge to mess up—they almost always do—and your side strikes back. This peaceful transfer of power concept is at the core of America. Whatever else happens in coming years, preserving that principle is crucial. Loser: The beneficiaries of "free trade" policies, especially big exporters such as Boeing, Caterpillar, ADM and the like. I never totally count out Big Business and its Gucci'd friends. But I absolutely believe Trump when he says he'll tear up or severely renegotiate NAFTA, block TPP and potentially set off a trade war with China, a huge market for companies such as Motorola. I doubt the new president will be able to magically produce new jobs here—or, for that matter, replace the jobs in Chicago's service economy that could be lost if the U.S. goes too far. Killing a few trade deals is easy, though, and with the Democratic Party's Bernie Sanders wing in agreement, Trump will just have to deliver on that score. Winner: GOP mega-fundraiser Ron Gidwitz. His instincts were good a year ago, when he urged Sen. Mark Kirk, R-Ill., to withdraw from a re-election race he could not win. Gidwitz later backed off under enormous pressure, but Kirk ended up being the only Senate Republican to lose yesterday. Beyond that, the Chicago investor and former cosmetics exec raised major coin for GOP Senate hopefuls in Wisconsin and Indiana who at one time were considered huge underdogs. Perhaps most significant, he was the only ranking member of the Illinois GOP establishment to kiss and make up with Trump well before the election, raising what I'm told is at least $1 million for him. That's important because, overall, Illinois is a big loser with Trump, at least in terms of having political chits to call in. All but gone now are the days when Mayor Rahm Emanuel could call on his old pals in the White House to get money for a Chicago Transit Authority project or the like. And with Kirk's loss, Gov. Bruce Rauner loses his best tie to D.C. In fact, I'm told that the governor and Trump may not have ever spoken, though the man who served as Rauner's general counsel in his election campaign, Nick Ayers, is a senior adviser to Vice President-elect Mike Pence. Another big loser: Lincolnwood's Merrick Garland and his nomination for a seat on the U.S. Supreme Court. That is dead. Trump now will get to fill that seat and perhaps one or two others, potentially leading to a reversal of the Roe v. Wade abortion decision, and serving Democrats setbacks on any number of social issues. A winner: Populism. Though Trump's blue-collar appeal frankly scares some voters, the same voters yesterday approved referenda in four states raising the minimum wage. If Washington Republicans don't follow up, the Democrats will have a dandy issue to rally middle-class voters in 2018. Ditto gun control. Clinton was way, way out in front on that issue, and her loss could stall progress. But voters in California, Maine, Nevada and Washington approved limits, so the idea has some legs. Winner: Anyone who works in the health consulting business, because it's now completely uncertain how Trump will implement his vow to repeal Obamacare. A big change is coming, but putting insurance companies back in charge of things such as pre-existing conditions will spark some of that populist backlash I just noted. There's more. Like the effect on Rauner's re-election race. (Probably not helpful). But you get the idea. Much more so than other elections, this one will have an effect. And it's going to take some time to figure out all of the angles of impact. Chicago Transit Authority Bruce Rauner Donald Trump Mark Kirk Mike Pence Rahm Emanuel Ronald J.

American has more than 1,100 aircraft with Wi-Fi service, a number the airline said gives it one of the largest Wi-Fi-equipped fleets in the world. ViaSat’s largest North American customer to date is JetBlue Airways Corp., which provides the service to passengers for free through a marketing partnership with Amazon.com Inc. In June, the world’s largest airline split an order between the two Wi-Fi providers, with ViaSat contracted for service on 100 new Boeing 737 Max planes and Gogo tapped to install its new 2Ku satellite service on more than 130 Airbus A319s and A320s. The ViaSat installations begin in the summer of 2017, while the Gogo additions will begin late next year, American Airlines spokeswoman Martha Thomas said Wednesday. In early June, Chicago-based Gogo told investors that about 550 American planes with its equipment  “are subject to deinstallation at any time at American’s option.” Gogo also said it expected that American would exercise that right for many, or perhaps all, of those aircraft “from time to time over the next several years.” ViaSat disclosed a large new order with its quarterly earnings report Nov. 8 but declined to reveal which airline, per the customer’s request. Carlsbad, Calif.-based ViaSat operates its own satellites, while Gogo and Global Eagle Entertainment Inc. contract with other satellite companies. “Gogo will still be outfitting other aircraft in our domestic fleet with its 2ku satellite Wi-Fi and Panasonic continues to provide satellite Wi-Fi for our international widebody fleet,” Thomas said, adding: “Gogo remains a valued partner.” American uses Panasonic Aviation on more than 60 of its international wide-body aircraft.  Gogo spokesman Steve Nolan said in an e-mail Wednesday that American’s announcement is “really old news and confirms what we said in our June 3 public statement. It doesn’t change our business outlook and financial guidance.” Separately, Southwest said late Tuesday that it’s reviewing proposals for a “secondary connectivity provider” to the Row 44 service it has from Global Eagle on its fleet of more than 700 Boeing 737s. Southwest is Global Eagle’s largest customer. The airline said it would have “more to share in the coming weeks,” spokeswoman Michelle Agnew said Tuesday. Southwest hasn’t revealed which companies it’s reviewing for the second service or how much of its fleet would be covered. Shares of Global Eagle fell more than 12 percent to $7.17 in New York trading. Gogo fell almost 8 percent to $8.91, while ViaSat rose more than 11 percent to $78.45.

Qatar Airways turning 20 - and hoping for a joint venture with American Airlines CAPA > Aviation Analysis > Qatar Airways turning 20 - and hoping for a joint venture with American Airlines 10-Nov-2016 Tweet © CAPA Qatar Airways turns 20 in 2017. The once tiny regional airline has become a global powerhouse and is reshaping oneworld, the alliance to which it belongs. Qatar has stakes in IAG and LATAM, and Qatar Airways CEO H.E. Akbar Al Baker has told CAPA that in the near future he expects Qatar to make acquisitions in two additional airlines, aside from Meridiana. He said the additional airlines would be successful airlines, as "We are not going to collect crap". Strategic partnerships without equity are important; Mr Al Baker hopes American Airlines will cease its partnership with Etihad Airways and work solely with Qatar Airways, even forging a multilateral JV anchored around American, British Airways/IAG and Qatar. Qatar is heading towards a fleet of 250 aircraft in 2-2.5 years' time. Mr Al Baker expects recently ordered 787-9s to replace 787-8s, while an LoI for 737 MAX 8s will be to replace Qatar's A320s and grow that fleet. Qatar Airways to have 250 aircraft in two years. Al Baker leads 'disciplined' approach Outlining future plans, Mr Al Baker highlighted that Qatar Airways will have 250 aircraft in 2-2.5 years. Emirates in Nov-2016 has 242 aircraft in Nov-2016, but all are widebodies. Qatar's 189 aircraft in Nov-2016 include 49 narrowbody aircraft and mostly medium-sized widebodies, whereas Emirates has more of a large/very large widebody fleet (although it has been evaluating the medium-sized widebodies A350 and 787). Qatar's existing impact in size and strategic direction earned it the title of CAPA Airline of the Year, awarded on 27-Oct-2016 at the CAPA Global Aviation Summit in Amsterdam. In accepting the award Mr Al Baker reflected on how he had initially refused the CEO job for six months but finally accepted it. Since then his impact on the airline has been pronounced, as he led it from being a small regional airline to the global powerhouse it is today. Like many reigns, Mr Al Baker's defining tenure and high objectives have not been a match for everyone. Mr Al Baker said he knew that his reputation at the airline was "The Dictator", but defended his actions as "discipline" necessary to delivery the high service that is a core part of Qatar Airways. Comparing Qatar Airways with competitors Mr Al Baker remarked: "They have legacy costs, they have inefficient airport regimes...they have low utilisations of their airplanes compared to us, and of course most importantly the standards of service that people have to give. And if they don't give, then they have to leave the organisation. They have to leave. They don't have to worry, we don't have to worry about unions. People are accountable and people have to deliver." Qatar Airways CEO Akbar Al Baker interview after receivig the award for CAPA Airline of the Year: Oct-2016 Source: CAPA TV. Qatar CEO Al Baker: 'It's not all about money' Like its peers Emirates and Etihad, Qatar Airways faces a range of accusations to the public and government designed to discredit them or stop/reduce their expansion. A common public accusation is that Gulf airlines, via their wealthy government owners, have unlimited money and that this alone changes competition to a point where others cannot compete. Mr Al Baker rejected this notion, saying: "Just sitting on the fence and crying foul that these Gulf carriers, as one of the CEOs of a European carrier said, 'They only have sand and money' – that is not the case. When people say this about our region, I think they are just sitting and smelling glue because they don't realise we are really sophisticated countries, we don't just throw away money because we want to throw away money. We are launching successful entities". Mr Al Baker concluded: "It's not all about money and sand. It's about serious business". Even if the money argument was taken at face value, no amount of money at western countries (or Air India, for that matter) could address dysfunctional aviation ecosystems and hubs, as well as underlying service issues (for example, passenger treatment before considering hard products). Accusations to governments about Gulf airlines often come down to the lack of a "level playing field" or the lack of "fair competition". CAPA has recently analysed Mr Al Baker's views on "fair competition", a phrase that is central to EU open sky negotiations with countries/markets including the State of Qatar and the UAE. See related report: EU-Gulf open skies negotiations: Qatar CEO Al Baker warns of biased 'fair competition' definition As for competitor airlines' claims of a distorted playing field, Mr Al Baker said: "Actually there is a level playing field but they cannot play on the level playing field. They want to keep the cake and eat it themselves". Airlines competing with Gulf airlines face the presence of Gulf airlines, but also internal problems. It is arguable these internal problems (especially labour and unions) are a greater threat than Gulf airlines as these challenges impact not just markets that overlap with Gulf airlines, but all market segments. The impact on short haul services under threat from LCCs has been considerably greater in many cases; and managements, faced with inertial forces, have faced enormous hurdles in adjusting to the new environment. Air France-KLM's new management plan for example reflects changes that the new executives are taking because of the control from labour groups, especially pilots. See related report: Air France-KLM: Attempting to rearrange the deckchairs while pilots remain on full steam ahead Qatar Airways considering investments in two airlines Besides Qatar Airways' pending deal with Italy's Meridiana, Mr Al Baker said that Qatar was weighing two additional undisclosed investments. Mr Al Baker said the near future could see Qatar "making some more acquisitions. We will be making some interesting announcements soon...We have two other projects in the pipeline which you will get to know." Qatar Airways now owns just over 20% of IAG - the holding company of British Airways, Iberia, Aer Lingus and Vueling. In Jul-2016 Qatar took a stake in LATAM. Mr Al Baker praised LATAM's management and noted the long-term opportunities for the airline and Latin America once the current economic woes are over. While the opportunity is undeniable, it is unclear how much Qatar Airways will strategically benefit, given the limited ties between Latin America and the Gulf, and what traffic flows Gulf airlines can participate in from Latin America to the Middle East and Asia, even when factoring in growth. Latin America is the smallest market for Gulf airlines. Average daily flights from Gulf airlines to long haul regions: 11-Jul-2016 to 17-Jul-2016 Source: CAPA - Centre for Aviation and OAG. As with the IAG stake, investing in LATAM was not necessarily a prerequisite for a partnership, especially since they are each members of oneworld. As far as investments go, on a strictly financial basis there are typically better investments than airlines, so Qatar's stakes must have a few driving elements that are difficult to quantify precisely. See related reports: Qatar Airways buys 10% of oneworld's LATAM, to add to its 15% in IAG Qatar Airways buys its 10% stake in IAG, showing it wants a serious relationship LATAM Airlines Group has to undergo a delicate balance of short term pain for strategic gain IAG, LATAM and Qatar Airways group revenue, operating profit and net profit: 2015/2016 Source: CAPA - Centre for Aviation and companies. Note: IAG and LATAM for 12 months to 31-Dec-2015, Qatar for 12 months to 31-Mar-2016. Qatar order for 30 787-9s to replace 787-8s In Oct-2016 Qatar Airways announced a 100 aircraft deal with Boeing consisting of an order for 30 787-9s and 10 777-300ERs, and an LoI for 60 737 MAX 8s. Mr Al Baker told an interview with CAPA TV that the 787-9s will replace Qatar's 787-8s. Qatar has 30 787-8s in service, potentially allowing for a one-for-one replacement. Qatar Airways average fleet age: Nov-2016 Source: CAPA Fleet Database. The 787-8s have the second youngest average fleet age in Qatar's fleet, at 2.5 years. Only the A350 fleet is younger, at 1.2 years. Qatar's 787-8s range in age from 4 years and 7 months to only seven months. All but one of the aircraft are leased, according to CAPA's Fleet Database. The low ages, even at the "old" range, makes is unlikely that 787-9s will immediately replace 787-8s. Qatar may find benefit in operating the two alongside each other. Some airlines are finding that the 787-8 allows them to open new services, but the 787-9's larger size brings lower unit costs that make operations more sustainable. Qatar Airways CEO Akbar Al Baker interview with CAPA TV: Oct-2016 Source: CAPA TV. 737 MAX 8s to replace A320s, enter JV airlines Qatar's LoI for the 737 MAX 8s is yet to be finalised. It was entered into when Qatar had very difficult relations with Airbus over the A320neo, which Qatar Airways has refused the delivery of. This background has caused some to suggest that the Boeing 737 MAX LoI is leverage against Airbus, and that Qatar will not conclude the deal with Boeing. Nonetheless, Mr Al Baker said the 737 MAX 8s will be used to replace Qatar's A320s. Qatar operates 39 A320s, in addition to two A319s and eight A321s, its only narrowbody passenger aircraft. The addition of possibly 60 737 MAX 8s implies growth, although Mr Al Baker said that the aircraft could be placed into service with JV airlines. Noting airlines in the plural suggests that the aircraft would be placed with airlines other than Qatar's proposed investment in Meridiana. The planned Saudi airline Al Maha Airways has new A320s, but its launch prospects do not appear to be strong. Outlook: most radical shift would be Qatar joining American-IAG JV Mr Al Baker identified partnerships as central to Qatar Airways, remarking: "Cooperation, relationships will make this industry a win-win for everybody". Qatar Airways has been the only one of the three Gulf superconnector airlines to join an alliance. Qatar formed a JV with oneworld's Cathay Pacific, but this has since been dissolved. More recently Qatar and British Airways formed a JV. While Qatar owns approximately 20% of British Airways' parent company IAG, the JV was expected long before Qatar made the equity investment. See related report: British Airways-Qatar Airways form Europe's first Gulf airline JV, showing some oneworld flexibility Qatar's entrance into the oneworld alliance also resulted in it forming a bilateral partnership with oneworld's North American member, American Airlines. The Qatar-American partnership supplemented, and did not replace, American's partnership with Etihad Airways. Since Qatar joined oneworld and partnered with American, American has expanded its relationships with both Qatar and Etihad. American has even done this while denouncing Qatar as being part of the alleged subsidised Gulf airlines that the big three US airlines rallied against. Mr Al Baker did not like American choosing a bilateral partner over a fellow oneworld member, saying: "I don't see the sense of them doing business with two airlines from the same region and diverting more traffic to Etihad, ignoring the alliance partner Qatar Airways". It would be bold for American Airlines to end its relationship with Etihad and work solely with Qatar in the Gulf (oneworld's Royal Jordanian is in the Levant). Even more extreme, but logical, could be Qatar Airways and American Airlines forming a joint venture. With such a JV, the American Airlines-IAG/Finnair JV, and British Airways-Qatar JV, an end-game scenario could emerge of the three JVs being stitched together covering an expansive segment of travel. JVs have so far been region-specific, but ultimately in the long term and with adaptation from regulators could be combined and take closer steps toward consolidation. As for the prospect of American and Qatar having a JV with British Airways/IAG, Mr Al Baker was opportunistic: "I'm a businessman and I would be delighted to do this with American. I think the American Airlines administration has been misled by Delta and I think in the long run they will realise that a partnership with Qatar Airways is a very robust business proposition for them". In his opening remarks Mr Al Baker referenced how airlines long doubted Qatar Airways' growth ambitions. Having proved naysayers wrong, Qatar Airways is narrowing the gap in size between itself and Emirates. Qatar's planned next steps indicate continuing capacity growth while adding strategic growth. Qatar Airways is increasingly becoming too big to say no to. Want more analysis like this?

EU-Gulf open skies negotiations: Qatar CEO Al Baker warns of biased 'fair competition' definition 7-Nov-2016 As the US-Gulf airline dispute loses momentum with the American government, the big Middle East aeropolitical debate will now shift across the Atlantic to Europe, where the European Commission has a mandate to try to negotiate an open skies agreement with Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, as well as other countries/blocs, including Turkey and ASEAN. Qatar Airways CEO H.E. Akbar Al Baker gave a keynote presentation at the recent CAPA-ACTE Global Aviation Summit in Amsterdam and addressed the subject of the EU mandate. Mr Al Baker called for unquestionable third and fourth freedom liberalisation and eventual fifth freedom liberalisation. The devil as always is in the detail; the non-EU airlines in the negotiations are sceptical about how the EU will define a "fair competition" clause, and whether it will be left abstract enough that "fair competition" could potentially be used against airlines in a way they have not envisaged. The Brexit referendum could result in the EU negotiating side losing the UK, whose liberal views have balanced those of the more protectionist France and Germany. Brexit follow-up Part 3: Gulf airlines, Turkish lose UK ally in M/E talks as protectionism spreads 31-Aug-2016 The Brexit referendum produced a vote for the United Kingdom to leave the EU, although this process has not yet been formally invoked. In the scope of aviation, one outcome is the potential loss of the UK in shaping air service agreement negotiations. The UK has been a liberalising voice, one that often counterbalanced more protectionist views from France and Germany. The UK is often able to galvanise the smaller EU states too. The EU now has mandates to negotiate open skies with states, including the UAE, Qatar, Turkey and the ASEAN bloc. The UAE and Qatar, home to the three Gulf network airlines, are expected to produce the most contentious negotiations. France and Germany will surely takes cues from Air France and Lufthansa to impede Gulf growth. In this light there are questions about whether the talks are genuinely motivated, or merely designed to draw out the discussion and thereby not produce any additional traffic rights while under negotiation. What Air France and Lufthansa need is a real, lasting solution, rather than persevering Canute-like with stonewalling. Although a partnership seems logical, they may have waited too long. The Gulf airlines have found that they can succeed on their own. © 2016 CAPA Centre for Aviation :: Contact Us :: Terms & Conditions :: Cookies & Privacy Policy :: Glossary :: Feedback :: All times are in AEST (GMT +11)

In the Fox News coverage playing on screens in the ballroom, Megyn Kelly turned to Karl Rove. “It didn’t happen under Reagan or the Bushes. When was the last time a Republican president had a Republican Congress?” “1928,” Rove answered. “Incredible,” Kelly said. Yes, quite: Republicans actually had unified control for four years under George W. Bush and for two years under Dwight Eisenhower, as Rove amended when I followed up with him. But the 1928 comparison is instructive. It’s the last time a Republican president enjoyed anything like the majority Trump will have, particularly in the House. And how did that work out for them? Hoover took over in a time of general prosperity but stagnant wages and vast income inequality. Populists in Congress proposed dramatic increases in tariffs to help the struggling agricultural sector, the equivalent of today’s beleaguered blue-collar workers. The proposal divided Republicans in Congress and Hoover before they produced the 1930 Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act, setting off retaliation, freezing international trade, contributing to the Great Depression and accelerating a ruinous cycle of nationalism around the world. Hoover’s ghost should haunt the GOP right now. A populist, protectionist president has come to power at a time of long-depressed wages and vast inequality. He threatens to implement a 45 percent tariff against China and 35 percent against Mexico, and he’s about to collide with free-traders and pro-business interests in his own party. If they jettison Trump’s agenda and proceed with business as usual, they risk inflaming Trump’s already furious followers. If they do what Trump has promised, there will be chaos as they pursue what amounts to a mission impossible: enacting a huge tax cut, making enormous spending increases on infrastructure and the military and cutting the debt in half — all without touching Social Security and Medicare. With unified control, Republicans now own every issue — health care, the economy, national security — and Democrats, who narrowly won the popular vote and are supported by exit polls showing tepid support for many of Trump’s policy priorities, have little incentive to cooperate. Some early signs show Trump won’t hesitate to disappoint supporters. Drain the swamp? Trump has packed his transition team with a who’s who of the K Street lobbying trade, according to Politico. Among those in charge of staffing the new administration are people who have lobbied for or represented Altria, Visa, Anthem, Coca-Cola, General Electric, HSBC, Pfizer, PhRMA, United Airlines, Southern Company, Dow Chemical, Rosemont Copper Company, Boeing, Duke Energy and Nucor. The Trump-proposed ban on Muslims entering the country? As the Washington Post’s Jose A. DelReal reported, the Trump campaign removed that policy’s webpage Thursday, then restored it after the reporter’s inquiries. That wall on the Mexican border? “Going to take a while,” Trump lieutenant Rudy Giuliani said Thursday, suggesting “he can do it by executive order by just reprogramming money within the immigration service.” “Reprogramming” money away from … deportation? Truly building the wall would cost many billions of dollars and require approval from Congress. Giuliani said prosecuting Clinton would be “a presidential decision” — an extraordinary departure from the American tradition of removing the president from prosecutorial decisions, particularly since President Nixon tried to block the Justice Department’s Watergate probe in 1973. The Trump transition sounded another Nixonian note when Trump surrogate Omarosa Manigault told a conservative website that Trump is keeping an enemies list. The conflicting signals suggest Trump himself hasn’t settled on his course. His gracious victory speech was about reaching out to the opposition, but Breitbart News, whose once and future leader ran the campaign, has been whipping up racial fears (“Shock Video Shows White Man Viciously Beaten in Chicago After Election“). On Thursday night, the president-elect tweeted that “professional protesters, incited by the media, are protesting. Very unfair!” Friday morning he reconsidered: “Love the fact that the small groups of protesters last night have passion for our great country. We will all come together and be proud!” Trump’s internal tension is understandable. He can leave supporters disillusioned, or he can keep his promises — and send us all back to 1928.

Credit: NASA/Glenn Benson CAPE CANAVERAL — A building dedicated to the heroism of American astronauts, who put their lives on the line and became legends in the process, opened today at the Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex. The new Heroes & Legends attraction, which brings the U.S. Astronaut Hall of Fame from Titusville to the KSCVC main property, enjoyed its grand opening with more than two dozen spaceflight veterans on-hand. Famed Apollo astronauts Buzz Aldrin and Jim Lovell, the children of the late Neil Armstrong and Alan Shepard, plus other former astronauts greeted the public to the new facility. Packed with astronaut memorabilia and nearly 100 space artifacts, including the original consoles of the Mercury Mission Control room, Heroes & Legends delves into the character traits of the tenacious early pioneers, depicts the risks and thrills of spaceflight in a stunning 4-D “Through the Eyes of a Hero” theater roughly 28-feet tall and pays tribute to the 93 astronauts inducted into the Hall of Fame over the past quarter century. The 36,880-square-foot facility has 4 hours, 52 minutes, 23 seconds of video content to watch, 7,926 photos to see, a 10,900-pound, human-rated Mercury-Redstone rocket — MR-6, from the cancelled 1961 mission — hung from the ceiling and two space-flown capsules — Wally Schirra’s Mercury Sigma 7 from 1962 and Gemini 9 flown by Tom Stafford and Gene Cernan in 1966. Heroes & Legends is presented by The Boeing Company, the title sponsor. The original consoles of the Mercury Mission Control room are preserved and displayed at Heroes & Legends. Credit: NASA/Glenn Benson The U.S. Astronaut Hall of Fame, originally constructed across the Indian River on the Florida mainland, was created in 1990 by the Mercury 7, America’s first group of astronauts. But that facility, miles away from the central KSC tourist hub, always struggled to garner high attendance numbers despite the remarkable exhibits and personal mementoes on display. Now part of the KSC Visitor Complex, operated commercially by Delaware North Companies Parks & Resorts, Inc., the merger relocates the hall into the main campus. The likeness of the Mercury 7 is sculpted into the facade of the building, and guests walk by Mercury-Redstone and Mercury-Atlas rockets towering around the entrance. Credit: NASA/Glenn Benson KSCVC sees more than 1.5 million tourists each year. Bus tours of the space center are popular and the public can watch today’s Atlas, Delta and Falcon rocket launches from nearby pads. Other parts of the complex include the retired space shuttle Atlantis, preserved for future generations to see up close in a rousing display facility, the Apollo/Saturn V Center with an actual moonrocket, the Shuttle Launch Experience motion-based ride and the Rocket Garden with replicas of historic space boosters.

David Eulitt The Kansas City Star A little-known access tunnel runs between Kauffman Stadium and Arrowhead Stadium and underneath parking lot M. The tunnel is mostly used to move concessions and merchandise from the loading dock to the two neighboring stadiums. Painted walls mark the dividing line between the stadiums. David Eulitt deulitt@kcstar.com Workers transported beverages and other equipment to Arrowhead Stadium earlier this month as painters added names and jersey numbers of Chiefs Hall of Famers to the tunnel walls. The tunnel, called the commissary, runs underground between Kauffman Stadium and Arrowhead Stadium and underneath parking lot M. David Eulitt deulitt@kcstar.com Local mural artist Phil Shafer, aka Sike Style, painted the walls of the Royals’ part of the commissary tunnel that runs between Kauffman and Arrowhead Stadium. David Eulitt deulitt@kcstar.com The underground commissary tunnel that connects Kauffman and Arrowhead stadium starts with a loading dock at the south end of lot M between the stadiums and branches off below ground to the two venues. On the Royals’ side, the tunnel empties out roughly to the concourse behind home plate; on the Chiefs’ side, it opens to the first level concourse around the 15-yard line of the southeast side of the field. Allison Long along@kcstar.com 1 of 5 i By David Frese dfrese@kcstar.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story Since the invention of football and baseball in the 1800s, writers, poets, screenwriters and other ink-stained wretches have felled entire forests committing to paper the literary struggles of burly men waging sport on eternally green patches of earth. But win or lose, something strangely poetic occurs after each home baseball game in the tunnel connecting Arrowhead and Kauffman stadiums. When the millionaires on Kansas City’s baseball team depart the clubhouse after an evening of chasing a little white ball around an impeccably manicured field in front of thousands of blue-bedecked fans, nearly all of them have to walk through the pungent waft of fans’ ballpark garbage to get to their Escalades and tricked-out pickups. That last swallow of Miller Lite tepidly sloshing in a recyclable aluminum bottle. The final remnants of cotton candy hardening like sinew on the cardboard bone on which it was spun. The remaining smears of chili cheese left unwiped from the container once holding delectable ballpark french fries. What was fan enthusiasm only moments before hangs thick in the air as fan effluvium. “That part’s not the best, that’s for sure,” said Pat Tangen, principal for Kansas City’s Populous architecture firm. Tangen was one of a cadre of Populous architects and professionals who worked on the Royals side of the 2009 stadium renovations. Most of his work actually ended at the underground tunnel that connects the Kauffman and Arrowhead stadiums. But he found the idea no less fascinating. “I cannot think of another set of stadiums that have this type of situation between the two,” Tangen said. “It’s a great use of space. It’s a great consolidation of services. Instead of having to do it twice, you do it once.” Called the “commissary,” the tunnel begins at a loading dock off of the coveted “M” parking lot between stadiums. The tunnel dips below ground and splits into a T. Turn right for the Royals, turn left for the Chiefs. If one were to miss the directional signage, one could always follow the blue or the red. (In an ironic nod of coincidence, the Kauffman Center for the Performing Arts does something very similar at the back of the house: The backstage area of Muriel Kauffman Theatre is red, and Helzberg Hall’s is painted blue. In common areas between, the walls are painted a delightful nacho cheese gold.) Chief among the Truman Sports Complex underground commissary’s purposes is providing a throughway for pallets of soda casks and beer kegs. On the Royals side, the tunnel opens again in Kauffman Stadium in the bowl behind home plate. On the Chiefs side, it rises, turns slightly and empties out onto the southeast side concourse at about the 15-yard line. (In case you’re wondering, the commissary is not the same tunnel where Warpaint awaits his post-touchdown sprint on the field or where petulant tight ends retreat after being ejected by half-blind officials. Those egresses, as well as the player entrance and locker rooms, are on the west side of the stadium at ground level.) For the most part, the single commissary serves the two teams fabulously. The stadiums are rarely used at the same time, only for the Chiefs’ two preseason dates in August and a couple of regular season games in September. There have been other exceptions: Kenny Chesney concerts and the long-awaited Royals postseason runs. “We’ve really had to work together the last two Octobers,” said Toby Cook, the Royals’ vice president of publicity. “They’re full on with their season, and we were still playing baseball.” On Thursday at Arrowhead, painters applied final touches to the tunnel walls on the Chiefs side of the commissary. One side reads, of course, “This Is Chiefs Kingdom.” The other features the numbers and names of Chiefs Hall of Famers, from Lenny the Cool to Willie Lanier. The Chiefs don’t keep a whole lot of personnel in the tunnels, about 50 during the week, with about 2,000 on game day. It’s mainly a conduit for staff and the two teams’ food service contractor, Aramark. The Royals keep some personnel and offices in their tunnel year-round, from engineering to waste management. There are more workers in the tunnel during the season, of course, including the seamstress who repairs players’ torn pants or adds American League Championship patches to jerseys. The Royals also have dressed up their hallways in recent years, including a 100-foot mural by local artist Phil Shafer of SikeStyle Industries (he had a hand in designing the Chiefs’ mural, too). Shafer said the mural took more than a week to complete. “Working underground messes with your equilibrium,” he said. “I remember going to a brunch a day after I finished and thinking, ‘Whoa, sunshine.’ ” Shafer said staff primed the wall for him, which saved him and his crew a bunch of time. And, artists should take note: Math is important. Shafer said the biggest challenge might have been converting what he designed onto such an enormous canvas. He painted the mural after the 2014 World Series run. He had to return to repaint a World Series championship logo in 2015. “So, really, I painted them a good luck charm,” he said. Down the hall from the mural is painted a baseball diamond with photo displays of Kauffman MVPs fans have never heard of and probably have never even seen. It’s the stadium’s employees of the month board, with spots to recognize up to 10 “Employee All-Stars,” and staff members walk past it every day. In addition to all the incoming food and supplies, the commissary is the aforementioned channel for much of the stadiums’ trash. The Royals say they move more than 890 tons of waste through the tunnel in a year, the equivalent of much more than a Boeing loaded to the max with overweight Americans. That sounds like a lot until you hear Kauffman is recycling and composting even more garbage. Travis Bryant, director of guest experience at the stadium, says nearly 200 tons of glass, plastic, aluminum and cardboard are recycled, and more than 70 tons of food are composted. On the Arrowhead side, about 20 tons of trash and recycling move through the tunnel on game day, according to Brandon Hamilton, the Chiefs’ director of facilities. Most of the stadium waste is cleared out within 48 hours of the start of the game. It goes without saying times have changed in the four decades since the complex was built. And even though the single commissary still functions well, each team might like to one day have its own. “The needs for broadcasting and truck deliveries and trash have changed,” Tangen said. “You didn’t recycle back then, and now it takes a number of different recycling bins just for that. And I think if you asked the Royals and the Chiefs today, they’d like to have twice the space for those functions.” Building something new or expanding what’s there would take some doing. The concrete walls are at least a foot thick, and the whole area would need to be excavated to be expanded. When Cook gave us a tour a week ago, the Friday before the Chiefs outlasted the Jacksonville Jaguars, the tunnel walls were lined with food carts and beverages, and the halls were filled with the incessant back-up bleeps and blorps of forklifts, golf carts and gators. “Until you’re down here and watching things get moved,” Cook said, “you don’t realize how many hot chocolate jugs there are.” David Frese: 816-234-4463, @DavidFrese Related content See the underground tunnel players use between Kauffman and Arrowhead LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story Sports Comments Videos facebook twitter email Share More Videos 2:06 Odom: Mizzou's Michael Scherer, Terry Beckner Jr. tore ACLs Pause 7:50 Mizzou senior linebacker Michael Scherer discusses injury, career 2:20 Grandma of KCK boy fed to pigs recites a message she wrote to her grandson 2:35 Eric Berry to high schoolers: ‘Make the most of every opportunity’ 2:16 Evelyn Fields Day remembers childhood home before foreclosure 55:59 Chiefs 20, Panthers 17: Postgame analysis from The Star's sportswriters 1:56 AFC West: Best division in the conference? 0:43 Oak Mites' Bite: Within hours 'I was itching like crazy' 3:49 Bill Self breaks down KU's overtime loss to Indiana 0:44 Royals' Salvador Perez makes a splash at Shark Tank Teacher Edition Share Video Video link: Select Embed code: Select facebook twitter email 16 hours ago Mizzou's Cale Garrett on the SEC transition 2:30 16 hours ago Mizzou's Cale Garrett on the SEC transition 3:10 16 hours ago Mizzou's Aarion Penton on Josh Dobbs, defensive TDs 2:21 17 hours ago Mizzou's Damarea Crockett on quest for 1,000 yards View more video Sports Bucs receiver who sat during anthem over Trump speaks for many in sports Royals announce spring schedule: pitchers and catchers will report Feb. 14 Mellinger Minutes: So much Chiefs, a little Royals, and some Stick To Sports K-State player will wear late father’s number vs. Baylor, his former team Five things KU must do to beat the top-ranked Blue Devils in New York Sports Videos Subscriptions Digital Subscriptions Home Delivery E-Star Site Information Customer Service About Us Contact Us Newspapers in Education Social, Mobile & More Facebook Twitter Mobile apps and E-Star Mobile Alerts Newsletters Advertising Advertising information Print Digital Place a Classified Find&Save Local Shopping Copyright Commenting Policy Privacy Policy Terms of Service Subscriptions Digital Subscriptions Home Delivery E-Star Site Information Customer Service About Us Contact Us Newspapers in Education Social, Mobile & More Facebook Twitter Mobile apps and E-Star Mobile Alerts Newsletters Advertising Advertising information Print Digital Place a Classified Find&Save Local Shopping More Copyright Commenting Policy Privacy Policy Terms of Service

(AP) — A commercial satellite capable of taking high-resolution images from space was launched Friday from a military base along the California coast. The satellite known as WorldView-4 was lifted into orbit atop an Atlas 5 rocket from Vandenberg Air Force Base. WorldView-4 is the latest in a series of imaging satellites built by Lockheed Martin. It is operated by Colorado-based DigitalGlobe, which provides high-resolution images for government and private customers including first responders. The camera aboard the satellite is so sharp that it can spot the make of a car from nearly 400 miles above Earth, according to Lockheed Martin. It joins sister satellite, WorldView-3, which launched from the Vandenberg base in 2014. Both satellites can capture images of objects as small as 1-foot across. Friday was the ninth launch for United Launch Alliance this year. ULA, a joint venture by Lockheed Martin and Boeing Co., has launched 112 times since it was founded in 2006. Its next launch is a NASA weather satellite scheduled for next week from Cape Canaveral, Florida. WorldView-4 was supposed to launch in September, but was postponed by a minor tank leak and two wildfires at the sprawling base, which encompasses nearly 156 square miles (405 square kilometers) along the Pacific Ocean. The fires forced the evacuation of administrative buildings, but did not affect the launch complex. Firefighters who were assigned to the launch were diverted to corralling the flames. A firefighter died and another was hurt when the water truck they were in overturned on a highway outside the city of Lompoc, miles from the fire lines.

The time for speculating is over. Here's what we know for sure. Rich Smith (TMFDitty) Nov 11, 2016 at 11:41AM Has it only been nine months since I last wrote about Donald Trump and his defense policy ... should he ever become president ... which didn't seem at all likely at the time? It has. But now that the speculation has become fact, it's time to get specific. What do we actually know about President-elect Donald Trump? What has he said for certain about defense policy? And what does all of this mean for defense stocks? Image source: Donald J. Trump for President. Defining moment A lot of these questions got answered on Sept. 7, when then-candidate Trump made perhaps his defining public statement on defense matters at the Union League of Philadelphia. In three words, Trump summed up his policy as "peace through strength." Harking back to President Reagan (and before that to Emperor Hadrian),  this concept argues that by building a strong enough military, America can ensure it need not fight wars at all -- or that, if pressed to fight, it will win. But how exactly will President-elect Trump achieve said "strength" in the first place, and what does this imply for investors? I've identified three key themes. More money First and foremost, the overarching theme of President-elect Trump's administration will be one of more military spending. In Philadelphia, Trump blasted Congress and the Obama administration for cutting 10% from the defense budget "even though it makes up only one-sixth of the budget." That "only" suggests Trump thinks one-sixth of the budget is a proportion that should be bigger. As for how much bigger, well, as a first step, Trump says he will "ask Congress to fully eliminate the defense sequester," which implies increasing defense spending by roughly 10% right off the bat. More efficiency At the same time, this money will not come with strings unattached. Trump has gone on record blasting Lockheed Martin's (NYSE:LMT) F-35 stealth fighter jet as "not very good," suggesting that if the plane "cannot perform as well as the planes we already have," then he might not buy it at all. This and similar "common-sense reforms," as he calls them, suggest that despite spending more money on defense in aggregate, individual defense programs that benefit specific defense stocks might still suffer as Trump moves to "eliminate government waste." More troops and equipment Citing statistics that he says show the U.S. has (a) "the smallest Army since 1940," (b) the smallest Navy "since 1915," and (c) "the smallest Air Force since 1947," President-elect Trump promised to grow the Air Force roughly 8% in size, to "at least 1,200 fighter aircraft," the Army 10% in size, to "around 540,000" troops, and the Navy 27%, to a fleet of "350 surface ships and submarines." Such moves promise to be heavily hardware intensive and lucrative to companies such as Boeing (NYSE:BA), which build F-15 and F/A-18 fighter jets for the Air Force; to General Dynamics (NYSE:GD) and Huntington Ingalls (NYSE:HII), the nation's largest builders of military warships; and to Lockheed Martin, which builds both fighter jets and warships. The U.S. Marine Corps, and companies such as General Dynamics that supply it, could benefit most of all from a Trump administration. The President-elect says he will grow it by more than 50% to "36 battalions." At the same time, lower-profile branches of the Defense Department, such as the U.S. Missile Defense Agency and its key contractors, Raytheon (NYSE:RTN) and Lockheed, stand to benefit from Trump promises "to rebuild the key tools of missile defense." Thus, while Lockheed Martin might lose business if the President-elect decides to cut the F-35 program short (and even that is not certain), there's still the potential for Lockheed to make up such revenues in other programs such as missile defense, as defense spending continues to grow in the aggregate. The upshot for investors Incidentally, this latter promise also offers the potential to benefit naval shipbuilders General Dynamics and Huntington Ingalls, as Trump singled out these companies' Ticonderoga-class cruisers as key elements of the U.S. missile defense system. At a cost of $220 million to modernize each cruiser, and there are 22 of them, Trump admits this single project could cost taxpayers nearly $5 billion. And it's just one element of one program that Trump aims to expand. So to sum up, there's going to be a lot of military investment on the table under a Trump administration, and a lot of money to be made by investors who buy these stocks early enough. Will the investment be worth it? Ultimately, Trump says  his goal is to "make our military so big, so strong, and so great, so powerful that we're never going to have to use it." So maybe, just maybe, it really will be worth it. Fool contributor Rich Smith does not own shares of, nor is he short, any company named above.

Checking for new content Loading new content Democracy Now! HOME TOPICS DONATE Fri Nov 11, 2016 Will Trump’s Immigration Crackdown Be a "Cash Machine" for Military & Private Prison Contractors? Watch Listen 07m 51s By now, global markets have rebounded after plummeting upon the news of Trump’s victory. Stocks of some companies surged, including the largest private prison contractor, Corrections Corporation of America—which recently changed its name to CoreCivic—whose shares are up 43 percent since Trump’s victory. GEO Group, another private prison contractor, is up 21 percent. Meanwhile, stocks also surged for many military contractors, including Raytheon, General Dynamics, Lockheed Martin and Boeing. We speak with William Hartung, director of the Arms and Security Project at the Center for International Policy, and Seth Freed Wessler, reporter with The Investigative Fund who has been following private detention centers. JUAN GONZÁLEZ: By now, global markets have rebounded after plummeting upon the news of Trump’s victory. Stocks of some companies surged, including the largest private prison contractor, Corrections Corporation of America, which recently changed its name to CoreCivic, and is up 43 percent since Trump’s victory. GEO Group, another private prison contractor, is up 21 percent. Meanwhile, stocks also surged for many military contractors, including Raytheon, General Dynamics, Lockheed Martin and Boeing. AMY GOODMAN: For more, we’re joined by two guests. William Hartung is director of the Arms and Security Project at the Center for International Policy, his article for Huffington Post, "Trump’s Pentagon Plan Could Cost Almost $1 Trillion; Smart Diplomacy Would Be Cheaper, More Effective." Also here, Seth Freed Wessler, reporter with The Investigative Fund who’s been following private detention centers. His latest piece for The Nation is headlined "ICE Plans to Reopen the Very Same Private Prison the Feds Just Closed." We welcome you both to Democracy Now! So, the night of the election, it looked like S&P was going way down, but there were certain industries that surged: private prisons and military contractors. Talk about the military contractors, Bill. WILLIAM HARTUNG: Well, the contractors paid attention to what Trump was saying. And he gave a speech in October talking about increasing Pentagon spending—bigger Navy, bigger Army, bigger Marines, bigger Air Force, a Star Wars program. And it was pretty much tied to a proposal by the Heritage Foundation, which, as you mentioned, would cost close to a trillion dollars more over the next 10 years than the huge amount the Pentagon already had in store for itself. So they’re popping champagne corks. There was an article by Loren Thompson, who’s basically a paid flack for the industry masquerading as a journalist, who said, "Happy days are here again" for the defense industry. So I think our job is to make sure that that is not the case. JUAN GONZÁLEZ: But how does Trump skew that with his claims that he’s against many more military interventions by the United States and these regime change policies of the Obama policy? WILLIAM HARTUNG: Well, there’s no real logic, as is often the case, with Trump. He claims he doesn’t want regime change. He claims he can make the Pentagon more efficient. He wants allies to spend more. That would logically lead to lower Pentagon spending. But he’s kind of tied in with the neocons, with the industry. He seems to be taking a Ronald Reagan peace-through-strength argument. You can never spend enough on the Pentagon, then you decide how to use it. So, he’s made—he’s made the Pentagon a cash machine again for contractors. And I think, you know, those contradictions might be useful in trying to peel off some of his supporters, the ones who are reachable, to oppose some of these policies. JUAN GONZÁLEZ: And, Seth Freed Wessler, what about the prison industry, and the private prison industry especially? SETH FREED WESSLER: Well, immediately after it was clear that Trump had won, we saw the private prison companies CCA and GEO Group, their stocks just soar. And those are not things that happen out there in the economy on their own. They happen because people know that Donald Trump has run a campaign consistently describing what he will do and how he will treat immigrants. He’s been, actually, fairly clear about that. He said that he will deport millions of people. He says that he will repeal Obama’s executive actions that protect young undocumented immigrants, so-called DREAMers, from deportation. All of these people will be like—could be detained, if picked up by immigration authorities. And the size of our detention system is poised to grow. The Trump campaign has also said that it wants to impose new mandatory minimum sentences on people who re-enter the country after deportation, adding—requiring that people who return to the United States are handed years-long sentences for that act of crossing the border, which, if legislation like that passes, will result in, you know, multiple new prisons having to be built. The Obama administration recently ordered the department—the Bureau of Prisons to begin closing federal private prisons. That’s very likely not to happen under a Trump administration. We’re likely to see the opposite of that: a growing population of noncitizens locked up in federal criminal facilities and immigration detention facilities. In the United States, federal private prisons are used to hold immigrants, both in the criminal side and in the civil detention side. Both of those systems are poised to grow, because Donald Trump has consistently promised to deport more people, to round people up. And these are real threats. Communities around the country are gearing up to face a level of attack by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, restarting of things like workplace raids and using local police departments to nab undocumented immigrants and deport them, no matter what they have done or what they’re accused of. We now have news that Kris Kobach has joined the transition team for— AMY GOODMAN: The Kansas secretary of state. SETH FREED WESSLER: The Kansas secretary of state, who helped draft and push SB 1070 in Arizona, the law that has now been fought back in the courts. That sort of law, that allowed local police—it required local police to just ask everybody about their immigration status, made it a crime to be undocumented, that is the kind of thing that the federal government could do by itself all over the country. AMY GOODMAN: So, when Trump becomes president, he could just reverse the Justice Department order to work with for-profit prisons in the federal system? SETH FREED WESSLER: Yeah, it’s basically at this point going to be a question about how much space the Bureau of Prisons needs to lock people up. And if Trump gets what he wants, if he is locking up more noncitizens, the Bureau of Prisons is going to continue—very likely going to continue using that space. Now, there is an order in place. Obama has—the Justice Department has told the Bureau of Prisons to close these prisons, and there are several months now when some of these prisons could be emptied and closed. But what we just saw, under Obama, is that Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which has now been expanding the size of its detention system already, went in and started using one of those very federal prisons that the Bureau of Prisons just shut down. And I think we’re likely to see more of that: prisons that might have been closed being repurposed or being used as they already were. AMY GOODMAN: Rudy Giuliani, who is a key player right now for Donald Trump—the Daily News reported in July, on July 12th, that Rudy Giuliani’s law firm paid big money—was paid big money to lobby for the Corrections Corporation of America. SETH FREED WESSLER: Yeah, and GEO Group put money into a PAC supporting Trump. I mean, it’s clear that there is a lot of support in both directions. But Trump ran on a policy about going after immigrants. And going after immigrants, deporting immigrants, locking immigrants up, that means detaining and incarcerating people. And that’s very likely to happen through private prisons. AMY GOODMAN: Seth Freed Wessler, we want to thank you for being with us from The Investigative Fund.

clock menu more-arrow Books Inside the finest Star Wars art book ever made The complete works of Ralph McQuarrie, collected for the first time by Charlie Hall@Charlie_L_Hall Nov 9, 2016, 3:30pm EST Image credit: Ralph McQuarrie/Abrams Books tweet share pin Long-time fans of the Star Wars franchise will no doubt recognize the work of concept artist and illustrator Ralph McQuarrie. He was instrumental in turning George Lucas’ epic into a reality, and played a key role in creating the visual language for the entire universe. This fall, Abrams Books published Star Wars Art: Ralph McQuarrie, the definitive collection of his work. We’ve spent some time with the final product and can say without reservation that it is among the finest Star Wars art books ever made. The two-volume, $250 set comes hardbound with a custom slipcase adorned with the now famous concept art for Star Wars: A New Hope. It’s one of the first paintings that McQuarrie ever did for the project, depicting R2-D2 and C-3PO leaving their "lifepod" and setting out across Tatooine’s Dune Sea. Both black, cloth-bound volumes are 400 pages start to finish, and each full-color page is a dramatic 12-by-14 inches. At that scale, it makes the many two-page spreads inside a genuine treasure. But even more valuable is the behind-the-scenes history of the Star Wars universe that these books contain. While the forward, written by George Lucas himself, is bland in the extreme, the work of the book’s actual authors — Brandon Alinger, Wade Lageose and David Mandel — is extraordinary. It charts McQuarrie’s early days as an illustrator for Boeing where he produced aerospace illustrations and technical documents. Later, it highlights the work he did animating the Apollo missions in the 60s and 70s for television. It even touches on McQuarrie’s service in the U.S. Army, where he fought in some of the Korean War’s most brutal battles. The bulk of the text, however, covers McQuarrie’s working relationship with Lucas and other key members of the Star Wars creative team. Where applicable, the team has added additional works by other artists, including production photos, matte paintings and photographs of hand-made models. Together, they tell the complete story of the original Star Wars trilogy. There are also Easter eggs inside, including illustrations done for LucasFilm corporate holiday cards, toys and merchandise as well as original artwork produced for the Indiana Jones films. Abrams has agreed to share with Polygon’s readers some of the collections’ more than 2,000 images. Among them are new pieces from the LucasFilm archives, renderings of original McQuarrie pieces that have never been seen before in public or published in any book. Concept sketches, Darth Vader. The helmet sketch (right) has been printed frequently in the past, but only from a photographic transparency — the photograph caused the helmet and chest to appear softer than the faceplate, and the helmet appeared distorted. It is accurately reproduced here for the first time. Ralph McQuarrie/Abrams Books Illustration, Splinter of the Mind's Eye novel cover, late 1977. A classic piece, presented with a new photograph taken exclusively for these books. Ralph McQuarrie/Abrams Books Concept sketches, ice planet mobile turret, circa February 1979. Recently discovered among McQuarrie’s archives, and included here for the first time. Ralph McQuarrie/Abrams Books Portfolio illustration, The Emperor's powers, version 1. While McQuarrie had reference photographs from the film available while working on the portfolio illustrations, he sometimes blended in his own ideas as well, such as this evil face for the Emperor. He was subsequently asked to change the piece to match the film more closely. Ralph McQuarrie/Abrams Books Production illustration (photoprint), "Artoo and Threepio leave the pod in the desert," version 2. McQuarrie revised the painting twice, presumably at the request of Lucas. The first revision altered C-3PO’s face and abdomen. Ralph McQuarrie/Abrams Books Printed drawing with additional work for matte study illustration, Luke in Cloud City hallway. Pieces were retrieved from ILM’s dumpster by a young fan who frequently stopped by with his father to check for souvenirs, circa late 1979 or early 1980. ILM started locking their dumpsters not long after. Ralph McQuarrie/Abrams Books Poster illustration, "Fantastic Five", April 1, 1975. Early Chewbacca artwork from McQuarrie's "Fantastic Five" painting as inspiration for Zeb Orrelios from Star Wars: Rebels. Ralph McQuarrie/Abrams Books Illustration, "Jabba’s palace – North Gate Bridge", 1992. Star Wars: The Force Awakens was inspired by McQuarrie's depictions of Darth Vader's castle for Maz Kanata’s castle on Takodana. It also used images like this one of Jabba's Palace for the Jakku spaceport. Ralph McQuarrie/Abrams Books Concept sketch, snowtrooper commander helmet. Ralph McQuarrie/Abrams Books The 1979 LucasFilm holiday card. Ralph McQuarrie/Abrams Books Printed McQuarrie illustration with coloring by Craig Barron, Ark of the Covenant. This piece was inserted into a prop bible for pick-up shots of Raiders of the Lost Ark completed at ILM.

Missouri Ag News Headlines International Animal Genetics Leader Among Mizzou Honorees Missouri Ag Connection - 11/11/2016 The Mizzou Alumni Association (MAA) will honor broadcasting legend Jann Carl, internationally recognized geneticist Jerry Taylor, and 13 other outstanding faculty and alumni at its 49th annual Faculty-Alumni Awards Ceremony on Nov. 11 in the Reynolds Alumni Center. The Distinguished Service Award, Distinguished Faculty Award and Faculty-Alumni Awards will be presented to outstanding MU faculty and alumni. Jann Carl, who earned a bachelor's degree from the MU School of Journalism in 1982, will receive the 61st annual Distinguished Service Award, the highest honor presented to alumni by the MAA. Established in 1956, the award recognizes outstanding service by an individual whose efforts have added to MU's excellence. A champion of the Muscular Dystrophy Association (MDA) for 28 years, Carl has served as the national vice president and on MDA's board of directors. Carl has been supportive of Mizzou since her undergraduate days when she performed as the tiger mascot and served as Mizzou Homecoming Grand Marshal. Carl also served as master of ceremonies for the "Model Citizen" fashion shows benefiting the MU Thompson Center for Autism and Neurodevelopmental Disorders and sat on the national steering committee for the For All We Call Mizzou capital campaign. In her broadcasting career, including 14 years as an anchor and senior correspondent on Entertainment Tonight (ET), Carl has covered earthquakes, oil spills, the Emmys and the Oscars. At ET, she was nationally respected for her interviewing skills. The major stars and influential newsmakers she has interviewed include: Barack and Michelle Obama, Tom Cruise, Jimmy Carter, Oprah Winfrey, Johnny Depp, Robert Redford, Brad Pitt, George Clooney, Steven Spielberg, and Meryl Streep. Carl also co-hosted ABC's Oscar Countdown Academy Awards pre-show and the Tournament of Roses parade coverage on CBS and HGTV. Carl worked as a reporter for WLS in Chicago and KABC in Los Angeles. Currently she is the co-owner and co-host of Small Town Big Deal, a nationally syndicated family-friendly show that highlights positive story-telling and uplifting content about the hard-working people of America. Jeremy F. "Jerry" Taylor, Curators Distinguished Professor of Genetics and Wurdack Endowed Chair in Animal Genomics, will be honored with the 57th annual Distinguished Faculty Award, the highest honor presented to a faculty member by the MAA. Established in 1960, the award recognizes a faculty member whose sustained efforts in teaching, research and service have added to MU's excellence. The award places special emphasis on the recipient's relationships with students. An international leader in genomics, Taylor is a key player in the translation of next-generation genetic sequencing technologies, making DNA testing a reality for preventative medicine, which could lead to treatments for diseases in humans and animals. Taylor and his research team helped design the Illumina GeneChip, which has revolutionized how genetic testing for animals is performed, making it faster, easier and cheaper than ever before. The first chip his team developed is on display at the Smithsonian Institute in Washington D.C. Taylor's ground-breaking work on cattle genomics has led to more efficient livestock breeding operations, which has helped improve agricultural economies around the world, creating more food for hungry populations. His work in cattle has been copied and applied to pigs, sheep, horses and chickens--and has not stopped with livestock species. Farmers now use Taylor's DNA-based genomic improvement to improve plant crops as well. Over the course of his career, Taylor has given more than 450 national and international invited presentations and has received more than $43 million in research funding. He joined the University of Missouri faculty in 2002. MAA Faculty-Alumni Awards recognize the achievements of faculty and alumni. Assistant, associate and full professors are considered for their work as teachers and researchers and their relationships with students. Alumni are considered for their professional accomplishments and service to their communities and alma mater. This year, 13 awards will be presented: - Karen Ann Ehlmann, retired senior manager for The Boeing Company (alumna). - Margaret Engel, executive director of the Alicia Patterson Foundation (alumna). - Theodore W.

This route will be the nineteenth link to the Americas served by the airline. Air Europa have announced their latest connection to the Americas. Their service to Ramón Villeda Morales International Airport in San Pedro Sula, Honduras will be detrimental for the Latin American country, as according to 2014 statistics, the airport serves less than one million passengers a year. The route will operate once a week on Airbus 330-200 aircraft which has the ability to carry 275 passengers in economy and 24 in business class. This announcement follows the airline’s plans to begin service to Guayaquil, Ecuador and Cordoba, Argentina via Asuncion, Paraguay. The Guayaquil expansion followed three meetings that took place at Routes events over the past two years between José Joaquín de Olmedo International Airport and Air Europa executives. The meetings were supported by air service development consultancy ASM (Airport Strategy and Marketing). The consultancy has been working alongside the Ecuadorian airport on its network development strategy in recent years. Speaking earlier this year when the route was announced, Mike St-Laurent, vice president, consulting, ASM stated: “It is fantastic news that Madrid and Guayaquil are now connected with a new 5x weekly service by Air Europa. Working together with Guayaquil Airport, we presented a strong business case to Air Europa for this new route between the two cities. The new service will open up Guayaquil to a new wave of European tourists and promote business interests within the region.” Last month, the Spanish carrier announced the arrival of their third Boeing 787 Dreamliner of the 22 they placed an order for. Long-haul services are firmly on the forefront of Air Europa’s minds judging by their plans for the aircraft. This year, Miami and Bogota routes have been announced, and the Dreamliner has been earmarked to serve both Madrid to New York and a Buenos Aires link. The order of 22 aircraft consists of eight 787-8 and 14 787-9. The order for 14 787-9 Dreamliner aircraft is the largest every Boeing widebody order from a Spanish carrier. Air Europa boast one of the youngest fleet on the continent. The city of San Pedro Sula is the second largest city in Honduras after the capital, Tegucigalpa. Two-thirds of the country’s gross domestic product comes from the city, largely due to the clothes-weaving factories, better known as maquila. Earlier this year, AeroMexico announced additional frequencies to San Pedro Sula, offering a second daily flight from Mexico City.  This link is due to begin April 26, 2017.   The Fundamentals of Route Development This essential download gives you all you need to get started with air service development.

Economy 2016-11-11T10:54+02:00 10:54 11.11.2016 Kherson airport to stay in municipal ownership after reconstruction The Kherson airport after its reconstruction would remain in municipal ownership, as it is a sensitive facility of national defense, Governor of Kherson region Andriy Hordeyev has said. "I would like to thank previous governor Andriy Putilov who saw a potential in this facility. Since 2014 we jointly with the Cabinet of Ministers have decided to invest in it. We passed the bill on the public fund development in parliament and lobbied for the airport's reconstruction. We could have finished it more quickly, but red tape slowed completion," he said in an interview with Interfax-Ukraine. He said that aprons and two taxi strips will be finished by the end of the year, and the terminal will be rebuilt. "We have two potential investors who are competing. These are foreign investors who are ready to complete reloading, refrigerating and passenger terminals around the airfield. They would provide for logistics. They are interested in reconstructing the runway for Boeing-747 planes – to reinforce it and enlarge by 1,200 meters. My only requirement to them is the financial ability and retaining the facility in municipal ownership. We would not sell it to anyone, as it is a sensitive facility of national defense," he said. He said that this year the airfield was actively used by Turkish Airlines. "The loading of flights with tourists was 86% on average. Today it carried over 90,000 tourists. Even if each tourist gives UAH 500 to our economy (taxies, hotels, cafes, food), this is UAH 45 million in the internal economy of our region. We have invested far less," he said. Hordeyev said that the region has agreements with Ukraine International Airlines (UIA). "They received flight permits and presented a technical rider on the possibility of servicing flights. Thus, the passenger flow would expand more. UIA seeks to launch Kherson-Warsaw flights via Boryspil. This would help to reach Ivano-Frankivsk and Lviv with transfers. This would fully open Boryspil and the European destinations. Now we have Kherson-Istanbul – a large transport hub where one can reach any destination with transfers," he said.

10, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- European Smart Borders, Immigration Enforcement & Border Security Markets - 2016-2022 2010, 2015 & 2020 With 1.8 million asylum seekers (UN reports) crossing Western Europe's external borders in 2015, the European border agencies are facing challenges with a far greater reach than ever before. More than 1000 ISIS-trained jihadists returning to Europe every year, coupled with the surge of migrants to Europe are alarming concerns; as present capabilities of the European border, coast guard, intelligence services and immigration agencies simply cannot meet these challenges. The EU-Turkey deal (if implemented) might lead to a significant decrease in the flow of refugees (by March-April 2016 the rate of migrants entering Greece declined by 90%). However, the agreement faces formidable practical, political and legal challenges (e.g., each and every one of the 22 EU parliaments has to endorse the treaty). In the aftermath of the migration crisis and the Paris and Brussels terror attacks, a major overhaul of the Western European border security and immigration infrastructure, strategy and funding is already underway. Following a 2010 to 2015 annual market growth of 10-13% the 2015 to 2020 annual market will surge by 104%. The "European Smart Borders, Immigration Enforcement & Border Security Markets – 2016-2022" report is the most comprehensive review of the market available today. It provides a detailed and reasoned roadmap of this growing market. The European Smart Borders, Immigration Enforcement & Border Security Market is boosted by the following drivers: The Western European border security, coast guards, immigration agencies and intelligence agencies are ill-equipped to counter the surge of refugees and 21st century jihadists who use sophisticated means to return to the continent. The Schengen Area is comprised of 26 European countries that have abolished border control at their common borders. Several Schengen Area governments reinstated border checkpoints by 2015. Europe cannot build a wall to keep out refugees and terrorists or enlist millions of border guards who would need to watch every inch of its over 10,000 land borders and 80,000 coastlines. Europol estimates that up to 5,000 European jihadists have already returned to Western Europe after obtaining combat experience on the battlefields of the Middle East. On 15 December 2015, the European Commission presented a proposal for a new agency that would replace and succeed Frontex, having a stronger role and mandate, and forming a "European Border and Coast Guard" along with national authorities for border management. Of Europe's approximately 50 countries, Russia has by far the longest coastline as well as the longest land border. Western Europe, the largest economy in the world with a 2015 GDP of approximately $22 trillion (vs. the U.S. $17.5 trillion), can invest "whatever it takes" to protect its citizens from the looming jeopardies of mass migration and terrorism. The border security and immigration enforcement industry faces a considerable challenge in seeking to provide the necessary solutions to current and future threats. At the same time, this challenge presents multi-billion USD opportunities to the defense, ICT and security industries able to deliver effective functions, integrate systems, and maximize security and productivity per $ invested. According to European intelligence services, ISIS has approximately 5000 original European blank passports which can be used by jihadists returning to the EU. The EU and the rest of the European border security and immigration infrastructure enforcement market for products and services are served by local defense and security companies. Even with a preference for locally manufactured products, foreign products can usually strongly compete on the basis of cost-performance. They do not encounter any EU direct trade barriers or quotas. Non-tariff, indirect trade barriers may be the approval process of dual use goods, which include many security market products. This report is a resource for executives with interests in the market. It has been explicitly customized for the security industry and other decision-makers in order to identify business opportunities, developing technologies, market trends and risks, as well as to benchmark business plans. * Customers who purchase a multi-readers license of the report will get the "Global Homeland Security & Public Safety Industry – 2016 Edition" report free of charge.

(Jasper Juinen/Bloomberg) Bombardier’s net loss narrowed to $94-million, or 4 cents per share, compared with $4.88-billion, or $2.20 a share, a year earlier. Revenue fell nearly 10 per cent to $3.74-billion. (Jasper Juinen/Bloomberg) Bombardier says Trump presidency is unlikely to affect operations Add to ... Nicolas Van Praet MONTREAL — The Globe and Mail Published Thursday, Nov. 10, 2016 6:10AM EST Last updated Thursday, Nov. 10, 2016 5:06PM EST Comments Print / License AA Bombardier Inc. has dismissed the potential impact of a Trump presidency on its operations as it reported a narrower third-quarter loss and said profitability for the full year would be better than previously expected. The shares jumped 9.5 per cent to close at $1.96 in Toronto trading on Thursday, their biggest one-day gain since April. “We still have a lot of work ahead of us, but Bombardier today is a much better and stronger company than it was a year ago,” Bombardier chief executive Alain Bellemare said in a conference call. Mr. Bellemare is one year into a five-year comeback effort for Bombardier, which faced a cash crunch in 2014 when it was trying to bring multiple products to market. He has since reduced the company’s risk by securing more liquidity and concentrating resources on the C Series airliner. Now, the focus is on rebuilding earnings and cash flow with an aim of generating EBIT margins of 8 per cent companywide by 2020. Those plans probably will not be derailed by decisions Donald Trump makes when he is U.S. president, at least as they relate to Bombardier’s supply chains and operations, Mr. Bellemare said. Among the questions investors are asking is how a Trump presidency will affect companies with operations in Mexico. That includes many auto makers as well as Bombardier, which has both rail and aerospace manufacturing facilities there. Mr. Trump directed significant hostility towards the country during the campaign, pledging to build a wall along the Mexican-U.S. border and scrap the North American free-trade agreement among other moves. “I think it would be too early to speculate about what that would imply from a trade perspective,” Mr. Bellemare said, noting that Bombardier is a global player with manufacturing power on several continents. “But I feel, you know, that it shouldn’t impact our operations at all.” There are other questions about what a Trump administration would mean for aerospace companies and rail equipment manufacturers. Bombardier is the only company in the world that is in both camps, because it makes planes and trains. In aerospace, a key question is the future of the Export-Import Bank of the United States, a government corporation that finances foreign purchases of U.S.-made goods such as aircraft. Boeing Co. has historically been the biggest beneficiary of the bank, with its commercial airliners representing the majority of Ex-Im deals as measured in dollars, said Scott Hamilton, an aerospace consultant with Leeham & Co. Mr. Trump has sided with those who see the bank as a poster child for corporate welfare. If he closes it, Boeing rivals including Bombardier would gain an advantage, Mr. Hamilton said. “Bombardier would be able to offer Canadian export financing support in [sales] campaigns where Boeing would not.” In trains, Bombardier also could benefit from Mr. Trump’s campaign pledge to spend $1-trillion (U.S.) on infrastructure over the next five years, one analyst says. Macquarie Capital Markets analyst Konark Gupta notes that 16 per cent of Bombardier’s train-unit sales currently come from North America. However, the company has struggled to deliver streetcars on time to Toronto. Montreal-based Bombardier reported a net loss of $94-million, or 4 cents a share, for its most recent quarter. That is a dramatic improvement from the $4.9-billion, $2.20-a-share loss a year ago when it booked a charge on the C Series and Learjet 85 programs. Revenue fell 9 per cent to $3.74-billion. Not including special items, Bombardier broke even on a per-share basis. Cash burn was $320-million, better than analysts predicted. This marks the third straight quarter the company has generated margins on earnings before interest and taxes, excluding special items, topping 6 per cent in each of its business units. It now expects full-year EBIT of between $350-million and $400-million, at the high end of previous guidance.

More than 1000 ISIS-trained jihadists returning to Europe every year, coupled with the surge of migrants to Europe are alarming concerns; as present capabilities of the European border, coast guard, intelligence services and immigration agencies simply cannot meet these challenges. The EU-Turkey deal (if implemented) might lead to a significant decrease in the flow of refugees (by March-April 2016 the rate of migrants entering Greece declined by 90%). However, the agreement faces formidable practical, political and legal challenges (e.g., each and every one of the 22 EU parliaments has to endorse the treaty). In the aftermath of the migration crisis and the Paris and Brussels terror attacks, a major overhaul of the Western European border security and immigration infrastructure, strategy and funding is already underway. Following a 2010 to 2015 annual market growth of 10-13% the 2015 to 2020 annual market will surge by 104%. The "European Smart Borders, Immigration Enforcement & Border Security Markets – 2016-2022" report is the most comprehensive review of the market available today.

Skip to content Military Technologies Military Press Releases European Smart Borders, Immigration Enforcement & Border Security Markets – 2016-2022 With 1.8 million asylum seekers (UN reports) crossing Western Europe’s external borders in 2015, the European border agencies are facing challenges with a far greater reach than ever before. More than 1000 ISIS-trained jihadists returning to Europe every year, coupled with the surge of migrants to Europe are alarming concerns; as present capabilities of the European border, coast guard, intelligence services and immigration agencies simply cannot meet these challenges. The EU-Turkey deal (if implemented) might lead to a significant decrease in the flow of refugees (by March-April 2016 the rate of migrants entering Greece declined by 90%). However, the agreement faces formidable practical, political and legal challenges (e.g., each and every one of the 22 EU parliaments has to endorse the treaty). In the aftermath of the migration crisis and the Paris and Brussels terror attacks, a major overhaul of the Western European border security and immigration infrastructure, strategy and funding is already underway. Following a 2010 to 2015 annual market growth of 10-13% the 2015 to 2020 annual market will surge by 104%. The “European Smart Borders, Immigration Enforcement & Border Security Markets – 2016-2022” report is the most comprehensive review of the market available today. It provides a detailed and reasoned roadmap of this growing market. The European Smart Borders, Immigration Enforcement & Border Security Market is boosted by the following drivers: The Western European border security, coast guards, immigration agencies and intelligence agencies are ill-equipped to counter the surge of refugees and 21st century jihadists who use sophisticated means to return to the continent. The Schengen Area is comprised of 26 European countries that have abolished border control at their common borders. Several Schengen Area governments reinstated border checkpoints by 2015. Europe cannot build a wall to keep out refugees and terrorists or enlist millions of border guards who would need to watch every inch of its over 10,000 land borders and 80,000 coastlines. Europol estimates that up to 5,000 European jihadists have already returned to Western Europe after obtaining combat experience on the battlefields of the Middle East. On 15 December 2015, the European Commission presented a proposal for a new agency that would replace and succeed Frontex, having a stronger role and mandate, and forming a “European Border and Coast Guard” along with national authorities for border management. Of Europe’s approximately 50 countries, Russia has by far the longest coastline as well as the longest land border. Western Europe, the largest economy in the world with a 2015 GDP of approximately $22 trillion (vs. the U.S. $17.5 trillion), can invest “whatever it takes” to protect its citizens from the looming jeopardies of mass migration and terrorism. The border security and immigration enforcement industry faces a considerable challenge in seeking to provide the necessary solutions to current and future threats. At the same time, this challenge presents multi-billion USD opportunities to the defense, ICT and security industries able to deliver effective functions, integrate systems, and maximize security and productivity per $ invested. According to European intelligence services, ISIS has approximately 5000 original European blank passports which can be used by jihadists returning to the EU. The EU and the rest of the European border security and immigration infrastructure enforcement market for products and services are served by local defense and security companies. Even with a preference for locally manufactured products, foreign products can usually strongly compete on the basis of cost-performance. They do not encounter any EU direct trade barriers or quotas. Non-tariff, indirect trade barriers may be the approval process of dual use goods, which include many security market products. This report is a resource for executives with interests in the market. It has been explicitly customized for the security industry and other decision-makers in order to identify business opportunities, developing technologies, market trends and risks, as well as to benchmark business plans. * Customers who purchase a multi-readers license of the report will get the “Global Homeland Security & Public Safety Industry – 2016 Edition” report free of charge.

Stater was a ball turret gunner in a B-24 bomber that crash-landed in Yugoslavia during World War II. Travis Heying The Wichita Eagle In 23 bombing missions over Europe during World War II, Harry Stater was a B-24 ball turret gunner who never fired a shot from his machine guns. “War wasn’t a pleasant deal then,” Slater, now 93, said. Travis Heying The Wichita Eagle Harry Stater’s B-24 and fellow crew members, World War II. Courtesy photo 1 of 3 i By Roy Wenzl rwenzl@wichitaeagle.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story The first thing Harry Stater makes clear, when a visitor comes knocking, is: “I’m no hero.” “OK?” he says. “I’m not. I didn’t do anything.” Maybe so. In 23 bombing missions over Europe during World War II, Harry was a B-24 ball turret gunner who never fired a shot from his machine guns. But some good stories are simple: They tell of ordinary men who do their best when the best is sorely needed. Larry Stater regards his dad as someone noble, because of the war, and what happened after. We’ll start with the war. Depth perception “I was born in Mount Vernon, Mo., in 1923,” Harry said. He’s 93 now, and lives alone in Derby. He’s got no big plans for Veterans Day. “I tried to enlist as soon as the war started. They said they didn’t need me just then. ‘Wait for the draft,’ they said. “So when they drafted me in 1943, they sent me to Fort Leavenworth and asked what I wanted to do. I said the Marines. “Then they did some tests and said, ‘You have good depth perception.’ So they put me in the Army Air Corps.” ‘Wait for the draft,’ they said. Harry Stater, World War II veteran He and his crew learned how to bomb targets from B-24 bombers. They traveled to train: Kansas. Georgia. Texas. Virginia. Harry learned to fire a machine gun backward out of a ball turret on the underside of a B-24. They flew to Europe by way of Maine, then Gander Bay, Newfoundland; then Marrakech in French Morocco, then Tunis in Tunisia, then Italy. From Spinazzolla, Italy, they flew their second bombing mission, in October 1943, over German military war targets near Vienna, Austria. Harry saw smoke from anti-aircraft shells exploding in the air near their B-24. “A couple of our engines were shot out from the anti-aircraft,” he said. That cut their power, which meant they were descending at a time when they had to fly back over the snow-capped Alps to get home. “We got so low we ended up flying between two peaks,” Harry said. It was too much for the B-24. They lost altitude and eventually crash-landed somewhere in what was then called Yugoslavia. “We crawled out of that plane and saw that we’d landed wheels-up, which was quite a sight to itself,” Harry said. “And I never saw so many people, all crowded around us.” They were armed men, but Harry’s suspense didn’t last long. “They were partisan fighters, and they were all for the U.S. They took care of us, fed us, and after about a week over there, they put us on a little boat, and we made our way back to Italy.” More missions Surviving a shoot-down meant you got another plane, and flew more missions. Harry and his crew flew 21 more. ‘Wait for the draft,’ they said. Harry Stater, World War II veteran “Sometimes the smoke from the anti-aircraft was really thick. I saw other planes go down; they looked like a little toy airplane might look if someone just threw it. At times I thought I’d never make it home. “One time we got buzzed by a German fighter, a Messershmitt ME109, and that made a heck of a sound when the machine guns fired. But the last I saw of that ME-109, there was an American P-38 fighter after him.” Was he ever scared? “Only on every mission I flew,” he said. They bombed Germany, Italy, Austria, Czechoslovakia. They dropped fragmentation bombs on ground troops, and heavy bombs on factories or military targets. They flew their last mission on May 1, 1945, just before the war ended. War trauma “I had some emotional problems; it was hard to keep food down, and sometimes I’d throw up. “I tried to go to college, on the GI Bill, but after nearly a year I realized I could not sit still in the classes and listen to lectures. I was so nervous. So I quit. “War wasn’t a pleasant deal then. No war is pleasant, for that matter. It’s a shame we have to kill each other to prove something.” He scrounged for jobs, drove a cab for a while, went to Wichita one day to visit friends – and ended up working for Boeing for three decades. He married a smart girl from Wellington, Jane Merrill Henderson, who loved him deeply and helped him recover from his war traumas. “A family helps with that.” War wasn’t a pleasant deal then. Harry Stater, World War II veteran He had five children with Jane, including Larry, his oldest son here in Wichita. “But you never know what’s going to happen.” On Aug. 29, 1973, 30 years after he started flying bombing missions, he heard a thud in his bedroom. He ran in, picked up Jane, and put her on the bed. He called police. They called an ambulance. But she died in that room; a heart attack, at age 42. And what did he do after that? “So we live as best we can,” he said. “Here one day, gone the next.” A good person, good dad That cryptic answer, with almost no information or emotion in it, is classic Harry Stater, his son said. “He would not tell us what happened to him in the war,” Larry Stater said. “Or that it bothered him. We knew he’d been shot down. We knew he’d been rescued by freedom fighters. But that was it.” “But here’s what we knew about him: My dad has always been a good person, well liked by everyone he ever met. “He worked for Boeing for 33 years, served at the VFW for many years. And though he worked all the time, he was still concerned with all us kids. “He was a good dad. Our mother died at a young age, and he had to bring the younger ones up by himself, while he was working. That was not easy. It about killed him, losing her. Larry Stater, veteran’s son “It about killed him, losing her,” he said. “That’s the first time I ever saw my dad cry. It was not just a few tears. It was all-out crying. “He did his best by the kids, raising them alone. “He never talked down to us. He tried to teach us as much as he knew. He taught us to be honest and truthful. “He did a pretty good job. We got nobody in jail, nobody in trouble; most everybody has a family.” Harry Stater, who served his country, and was by his own account not a hero, lives alone in Derby, in an assisted living facility. He has five children, 10 grandchildren, five great-grandchildren. He did his best to do right by all those kids – and all the rest of us, Larry Stater said. “I don’t know how much better a man can be than he is.” Roy Wenzl: 316-268-6219, @roywenzl Related content LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story Local Comments Videos facebook twitter email Share More Videos 3:00 Trump vows to be a president for all Americans Pause 3:15 Whooping cranes at Texas Aransas National Wildlife Refuge 1:57 Wink Hartman Sr. may open downtown grocery 0:42 Supermoon over Wichita 3:49 How Westar sale affects Wichita 0:46 Supermoon rises over Wichita 4:38 Dining with Denise: Wichita's most obscene foods 0:39 Fatal shooting on East Harry 0:32 Crime scene where two were stabbed and one girl is dead 0:28 Eyewitness captures the arrest of 'person of interest' in stabbing death Share Video Video link: Select Embed code: Select facebook twitter email 5 hours ago Grandma of KCK boy fed to pigs recites a message she wrote to her grandson 2:20 5 hours ago Grandma of KCK boy fed to pigs recites a message she wrote to her grandson 0:59 18 hours ago Fatality accident on K-254 near I-135 0:42 20 hours ago Supermoon over Wichita View more video Local Police identify man killed in Wichita restaurant Triple-stabbing defendant expected to plead no contest today Planned Parenthood opens its first abortion clinic in Oklahoma Maize school district approves attendance boundaries Grandma of KCK boy fed to pigs recites a message she wrote to her grandson Editor's Choice Videos Subscriptions Digital Subscriptions Subscriber Services E-Eagle Site Information Customer Service About Us Contact Us FAQ Social, Mobile & More Mobile Options Facebook Twitter YouTube Google+ Newsletters Advertising Information Digital Advertising Rates Place a Classified Find&Save Local Shopping Copyright Commenting Policy Privacy Policy Terms of Service Subscriptions Digital Subscriptions Subscriber Services E-Eagle Site Information Customer Service About Us Contact Us FAQ Social, Mobile & More Mobile Options Facebook Twitter YouTube Google+ Newsletters Advertising Information Digital Advertising Rates Place a Classified Find&Save Local Shopping More Copyright Commenting Policy Privacy Policy Terms of Service
Business News Home > Business > Business News < Back to SMG 45 Friday, 11 November 2016 Emirates calls outlook bleak as profit tumbles on strong dollar DUBAI: Emirates Group first-half profit plunged 64% as the world’s biggest airline by international traffic struggled with a rising US dollar and political and economic uncertainty that damped global travel and weighed on fares. Net income fell to 1.3 billion dirhams (US$364mil) in the six months through September from 3.7 billion dirhams a year earlier, the Dubai-based carrier said Wednesday in a statement. Revenue rose 1% to 46.5 billion dirhams. “The bleak global economic outlook appears to be the new norm, with no immediate resolution in sight,” Emirates chairman Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum said in the statement. “We continue to make strategic investments, because we know we have to work even harder for every customer.” Emirates, which has exploited its Persian Gulf location to turn its Dubai hub into an inter-continental crossroads, has faced a tough year. Low petroleum prices have sapped demand for lucrative premium bookings from executives in the oil and gas industry, while terrorist attacks in Europe have scared off travelers from Asia. The dollar’s exchange-rate gains held back revenue growth, which Emirates also said was hurt by currency restrictions in some African countries. Cash at the group dwindled to 14.9 billion dirhams by Sept 30 from 23.5 billion dirhams on March 31 as the company invested in new aircraft, among other payments. Emirates took delivery of eight Airbus Group SE double-decker A380 planes and eight Boeing Co 777s, and 20 more wide-bodies will join the fleet by the end of the fiscal year. Fuel costs fell 10% in the first half amid low oil prices, reducing spending on jet kerosene to 24% of operating costs from 28% a year earlier. New routes to destinations including Yangon, Myanmar, and Hanoi, Vietnam, helped push passenger numbers up 8.9% to 28 million in the first half. – Bloomberg Tags / Keywords: emirates Related Stories Emirates says ex-MAS CEO Mueller to join this month RM61bil orders by AirAsia Emirates profit rises 50% on fuel windfall and long-haul routes Dubai to close Sheikh’s buyout firm that held US$13bil Emirates, Malaysia Airlines add 15 destinations You May Be Interested Closure of 106 bank branches due to rationalisation plans, says Deputy Finance Minister Weak ringgit to impact 5 sectors Best smartphones for the holidays Alibaba's founder to support 'mini Jack Ma' until university graduation Private-public partnerships in a connected world Rejuvenate yourself with American ginseng Others Also Read Tourists now prefer lodgings with Airbnb flavour, hoteliers told Happy birthday!

A heat treat facility will open in 2017. Following major customers’ footprints, Austrian aluminum producer is keen on North American expansion November 2016 - An aluminum producer based in Ranshofen, Austria—immediately across the Inn River from Germany and less than 60 kilometers north of Salzburg—has been expanding capacity, shipments, revenues and profits for a couple decades now and the current phase is powering up in North America. One might wonder where AMAG (Austria Metall AG), which shipped 206,300 metric tons during the first half of 2016, fits in with giants like Alcoa, Constellium, Aleris and Novelis. Chairman of the Executive Board and CEO of the company, Helmut Wieser, doesn’t worry about that. “We have been in an expansion mode for the last 20 years,” he says. In 1995, AMAG produced about 60,000 metric tons of rolled products and last year, 175,000 metric tons. “Everything is already under way to expand to 300,000 metric tons.” AMAG’s product was chosen to decorate a highly visible luxury restaurant in Vienna. In 2014, AMAG started up a second hot-rolling mill, a plate production center, and expanded its cast house and its recycling capacity, Wieser says. “Slab is our material going into the rolling mills.” Between 75 and 80 percent of the molten metal is from recycled aluminum, which Wieser claims is a higher percentage than competing remelters.  The second hot rolling mill produces a wider and heavier gauge product: Sheet and plate can be up to 6 inches thick by 90 inches wide. “For tread plate, we go up to 82 inches wide,” says Wieser. Beyond that stage, AMAG will add wide cold rolling mills and a continuous heat treatment line for coil. The wider material is what customers in aerospace, automotive and other sectors want. “We can offer more capabilities based on the width,” says Wieser, adding, “It is a mitigation risk for the customer to have two large hot rolling mills and two large cold rolling mills.” By doubling production, there is pretty much a zero chance AMAG would miss a promised delivery.  The second cold mill and heat treatment facility will be fully operational next year. In all, AMAG has invested €520 million in the accumulated projects. The company exports about 85 percent of its volume; 50 percent is consumed by Western European customers, 25 percent goes to North America and 5 percent is shipped to Asia. “We have been exporting to the United States more than 25 years and we continuously increase that,” Wieser says.  Alouette One part of AMAG’s global footprint lies in Sept-Iles, Quebec, at the mouth of the St. Lawrence River. That is where Alouette Aluminerie produced around 600,000 metric tons of ingots last year. The largest smelter in North America is co-owned by Rio Tinto, Marubeni Metals & Minerals Canada, Hydro Aluminium, AMAG and the provincial government (Investissement Quebec). AMAG takes 20 percent of the output and “most of the product is shipped to the American market. We barely bring any metal to Europe,” says Wieser. The additional hot and cold rolling equipment mills support the production of heavy-gauge aluminum, with plate being as thick as 6 inches and up to 90 inches wide. This partnership has been beneficial on several levels, he says. “Many other smelters closed down in Canada and the U.S., which makes Alouette even more important to our future.” The partners secured a new electricity contract last year, effective in 2017 and which won’t expire until 2029. It will tie the kilowatt rate to the spot price of aluminum, which helps improve both the cost position and risk profile in relation to fluctuating LME prices and currency exchange rates. Based on hydropower, the long-term contract also gives Alouette “a minimum carbon footprint” among competing smelting operations globally, according to Wieser. “It has set worldwide benchmarks in energy efficiency and cleanliness.” There are plans on the books to boost Alouette’s capacity, but “because of low aluminum prices, this is not the right time to decide. When the opportunity arises, we have prepared the ground for it,” Wieser says. All five partners must agree to any such capital project.  Market diversity “We are proud to serve Boeing [Co.] in sheet and plate,” Wieser says. “We are also the certified supplier to the automotive industry, including Audi, BMW, Daimler-Mercedes, General Motors, Fiat Chrysler and Porsche. And we sell to tier I suppliers like Magna International, stampers and automotive service centers.”   The company also rolls architectural product. Northwestern University’s Kellogg School of Management will open a 410,000-square-foot education center this winter on the shores of Lake Michigan in Evanston, Illinois. The façade features AMAG aluminum. “All the heat treatable alloys are specialty products from our plant. This means skin sheet and plates for aerospace, auto body sheet and structural—crash management—applications, brazing sheets for coolers and heat exchangers, and very bright material for automotive trim,” says Wieser. “Get into an Audi or BMW and you’ll find good-looking trim.” Demand for anodized and strong, perfect surface aluminum has been growing, he notes. “We have another automotive product, AMAG TopForm, which is made for super plastic forming processes. This is a special product with a very fine grain structure.” It’s especially used for complex geometries and for high-end luxury vehicles like the Bentley.” Based on its expanded capabilities in Ranshofen, “the wide sheet, wide plate and thick plate are entering the U.S. market,” says Wieser, noting that demand for these products “is good.” AMAG is also “producing marine grades, which were often a challenge due to the previously limited width.” Applications include tankers and dump bodies as truck builders adopt lightweight materials to meet more stringent fuel economy standards. Gerald Mayer, CFO, left, Helmut Wieser, CEO, and Helmut Kaufmann, COO, lead AMAG, remelter and roller of specialty grades of aluminum for aerospace, architectural and automotive applications. Stability Employing the right processes and products, even a medium-sized company like AMAG (first-half 2016 revenues were €461.4 million) can be a valued supplier with a global footprint.  “We are a public company. We have stable shareholders in a stable country. Many customers are very happy to count on our quality and delivery. We are not in commodities. Customers and shareholders can see we have sustainable growth. We have paid dividends in each of the last five years,” Wieser notes. AMAG will also seize upon every metallurgical and process technology development that makes economic sense. “We have 100 employees in R&D, many of them Ph.D.s,” he says. “We also have local application engineers in the U.S.” As a partner to automakers like GM, Daimler and Audi, which “have plants all over the world,” AMAG is poised to roll and ship what they need. “The latest development is producing C-class Mercedes in the United States. They developed technology in Europe and are deploying it worldwide,” says Wieser. By being adaptable, AMAG has proven itself with “a high proportion of specialty products compared with other aluminum producers.” He cites the production of heat treat plate and sheet for automotive and aircraft from a single location. “[Peers] produce either automotive or aerospace. Very few do both. That is a good crossover,” says Wieser, especially because “automakers are asking for aerospace quality product. So what we have done gives us synergies.” MM Sources AMAG Ranshofen, Austria phone: +43 (0) 7722-801-0 www.amag.at Editor's Choice Up to the task On the cusp Pure power Doubling down Durable beauty Most Viewed Alcoa Corp. launches as an independent industry leader in bauxite, alumina and aluminum products > Metals Service Center Institute and National Safety Council unveil partnership program > OMAX MicroMAX named finalist for prestigious R&D 100 Awards > Operational Excellence in Manufacturing 2016, December 6-7, 2016, Chicago > Ampco-Pittsburgh announces acquisition of ASW Steel Inc. > A veteran’s best friend > Copper Industry Sustainable Energy Director appointed to Federal Clean Energy Committee > Regional manufacturing centers boost high school completion rates > SSAB launches Docol (hot-rolled) steel, tailor made for chassis applications > Wismarq advances with strategic acquisition of Prior Coated Metals Inc. > LATEST ISSUE   November 2016 READY RESOURCE Service Center Metals produces billets to battle imports. > READ THIS MONTH'S ISSUE Instagram - @ModernMetalsMag Modern Metals on Twitter Tweets by @ModernMetalsMag Company Profiles COIL PROCESSING DEBURRING/FINISHING PLATE SERVICE CENTERS Butech Bliss Supermax Tools Peddinghaus Corp.

Source: US Naval Air Systems Command Sikorsky is pitching its CH-53K King Stallion heavy-lift helicopter as a potential solution for the US Army's Future Vertical Lift (FVL)-Heavy requirement, a company official told IHS Jane's in early November. With the CH-53K now entering into the operational testing phase of its development ahead of the commencement of deliveries to the US Marine Corps (USMC), the programme vice-president Mike Torok said that the US Army's FVL-Heavy requirement presents an "interesting opportunity". "One interesting 'downstream' opportunity is for the US Army's FVL-Heavy requirement that will follow the FVL-Medium [now being developed by Sikorsky-Boeing and Bell Helicopter under the Joint MultiRole-Technology Demonstrator (JMR-TD) effort]," Torok said, adding, "We have done some assessments with the US Army, and have shown that right off the production line the CH-53K hits a significant number of the key capability requirements without any additional investment." The US Army plans to field its FVL-Medium replacement(s) for the current Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawk and Boeing AH-64 helicopters in about the 2030 timeframe, to be followed by an FVL-Heavy replacement for the Boeing CH-47 Chinook from about 2040. Official performance parameters for FVL-Heavy have not yet been publically disclosed, but with a maximum take-off weight (MTOW) of close to 40,000 kg (with external load) the CH-53K will have the largest lift capacity of any helicopter in the US military when it begins entering USMC service in 2019. Other CH-53K performance specifications include a maximum speed of 170 kt; a range of 454 n miles or a radius of operation of 110 n miles with a 12,340 kg payload; and a service ceiling of 14,380 ft. While Torok conceded that, as it stands, the CH-53K does not meet all of the FVL-Heavy performance requirements, he suggested that it meets enough of them for the US Army to give it some serious consideration when the decision does finally come to be made, noting, "It will be an interesting discussion when we get to that point as to whether [the US Army] really needs the additional requirements, and if they have the budget for them."

Tuesday night saw markets thrown into disarray as investors around the world recalibrated their positions that had been set under the long-held assumption that Hillary Clinton would be elected the next U.S. president. Around an hour after trading started in New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down about 0.15 percent. The S&P 500 had shed about 0.36 percent, and the Nasdaq was off about 0.6 percent. All three indices had been in positive territory for a short period Wednesday morning. While in flux, the markets were comparatively calm relative to the tumult seen in corresponding futures markets Tuesday night. As overnight results painted a clearer picture that Trump would clinch the presidency, futures and foreign markets were thrown into the red. At one point, Dow futures were down 800 points, a figure that would have been worse than some of the darkest days of the 2008 financial crisis if it had stuck into regular trading. There were bright spots, notably in stocks for health care and defense companies, which could be boosted by Trump’s policies. The pharmaceutical, biotechnology and life sciences sector was up more than 4.6 percent around 11:00 a.m., according to Bloomberg, a financial data and news firm. The banking sector was up more than 2.8 percent, the firm’s website said. Defense companies were also faring well. Raytheon was up more than 6.2 percent around 11 a.m. Lockheed Martin was up about 5 percent, and Boeing was up about 1.2 percent. Private prisons, with which the Obama administration said earlier this year it would cut off ties, were enjoying a great morning. Corrections Corporation of America was up more than 36.3 percent shortly after 11 a.m. Its rival Geo Group was up more than 16 percent. One asset was still feeling a hangover Wednesday morning from the night’s drama: the Mexican peso. The Mexican currency has become somewhat of a celebrity asset over this election cycle, with investors and the media pointing to how sensitively it has reacted to the twists and turns of campaign developments. The peso began a substantial slide shortly after 8 p.m. ET Tuesday when voting results began to throw doubt on polling that showed a Clinton lead in recent days. At about 10:45 a.m., the peso was trading around 20 pesos to the dollar, having lost about 9.7 percent since the slide began the night before. Staying abroad, stock markets in Europe and Asia turned positive Wednesday. London’s FTSE 100 was up about 0.3 percent not long before it closed. And Nikkei futures in Japan were up about 4 percent after a large decline in the wake of the election result. Copyright © 2016, ABC Radio. All rights reserved.

Investors' initial fears were eased by Trump's inclusive victory speech and some of his policy plans, such as increased infrastructure and military spending as well as repealing landmark health care and financial reform laws, boosted stocks in several key sectors. Credit markets reflected more nervousness. Yield on many bonds, including U.S. Treasury securities, rose amid concerns that budget deficits might increase, and push up borrowing costs, if Trump pursues some spending programs and tax cuts he discussed during the campaign. The Dow Jones industrial shot up 256.95 points, or 1.4 percent, to close at 18,589.69, near August's record high after a relatively calm open. The rally came after an 800-point plunge in overnight futures as Trump's victory became apparent early Wednesday, after investors somewhat duplicated the initial market turmoil and quick recovery that followed the stunning vote in Britain in June to leave the European Union. The Nasdaq and the Standard & Poor's 500 rose about 1.1 percent after similar steep futures declines. "Markets tend to assume the worst and react immediately," Brad McMillan, chief investment officer for Commonwealth Financial Network, said in a note to clients before the opening bell Wednesday. "Expect an immediate market pullback on fear, and then a pause." As with the surprise "Brexit" vote, when Britain voted in June to leave the European Union, part of the market's turmoil reflected money managers having guessed incorrectly on the outcome of the election. "Markets tend to have knee-jerk reactions to these kind of situations" and in this case investors also "had all but priced-in a (Hillary) Clinton victory," Nigel Green, chief executive of the financial advisory firm DeVere Group in London, said in a statement. Major stock indexes had fallen around the globe as world markets digested Trump's victory. Japan's Nikkei index fell more than 5 percent overnight but major European indexes turned positive later Wednesday recovering from sharper declines earlier in the day. Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate.com, said Trump's inclusive victory speech helped calm markets -- for now. "It's a knee-jerk reaction in both cases, first to the shocking election outcome second to the very tempered speech that President-elect Trump had given in acceptance," McBride said. "In neither case are the multitude of questions outstanding answered," he said, adding that Trump was "deliberately vague" on specific policy positions during the campaign. "So in the face of unanswered questions, I would expect very choppy waters in financial markets over the coming weeks and months," McBride said. There was confusion in the credit markets, too. Prices of many U.S. Treasury securities -- typically one of the safe havens that investors seek in volatile times -- fell in early trading Wednesday, driving their yields higher. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, jumped to 2.06 percent -- the highest since January -- from 1.85 percent on Tuesday. "I don't think the bond markets have a good handle on the implications of the events of last night, so they're pricing in the potential for greater risk," said Guy LeBas, head of fixed-income strategy at the investment firm Janney Montgomery Scott. "If you look at the proto-policies that Trump has referenced, including possibly renegotiating the U.S. debt and running a massive deficit, while those outcomes are by no means certain that enhances the risk of Treasury securities," LeBas said. McBride said short-term bond prices fell because investors believe Federal Reserve policymakers are less likely to nudge up interest rates next month in the wake of Trump's victory. Long-term bond yields were up because Trump used his speech in part to tout plans for more infrastructure spending, "which portends bigger deficits and debt," McBride said. Stocks in certain sectors rallied on speculation that Trump's proposals eventually would boost the companies' growth. Big bank stocks surged with the expectation of less financial regulation and construction and heavy equipment companies rallied on Trump's expected push for more federal spending on roads, airports and other infrastructure. "We are going to fix our inner cities and rebuild our highways, bridges, tunnels, airports, schools, hospitals," Trump said in his early morning victory speech. "We're going to rebuild our infrastructure, which will become, by the way, second to none. And we will put millions of our people to work as we rebuild it." There is bipartisan backing for increased infrastructure spending. Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton also wanted more such spending and House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said Wednesday that "we can work together to pass a robust infrastructure jobs bill." Consequently, Caterpillar Inc. stock was up about 7.7 percent Wednesday. And shares of Vulcan Materials Co., which produces asphalt and concrete mixes, shot up more than 10 percent. Aerospace and defense stocks also rose in response to Trump's promise to build up the U.S. military. Raytheon Co. surged about 8 percent in morning trading, Northrop Grumman Corp. jumped about 5.8 percent and Boeing Co. gained 2 percent. Drug stocks also shot higher with Trump vowing to repeal Obamacare and replace it with another national health care plan. Pfizer Inc. and Amgen Inc. both rose 6 percent and Merck & Co. was up 5.5 percent. But Trump's exact plans are still unclear, so investors should wait for more details, said Brian Belski, chief investment strategist at BMO Capital Markets. "I think this is a very short-term bump," he said. (EDITORS: STORY CAN END HERE) The Mexican peso was down about 8 percent against the dollar after plunging earlier Wednesday by more than 13 percent to a record low amid concerns about a Trump presidency. Trump has promised to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border to halt undocumented immigration. He also promised during the campaign to rewrite or scrap the 2-decade-old North American Free Trade Agreement between the U.S., Mexico and Canada. Investors also were concerned about the effect of Trump's victory on global trade. Trump has been highly critical of U.S. trade deals and adamantly opposes the proposed 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership pact with Asian nations. Those positions have raised fears among investors of a global trade war and a U.S. recession after Trump takes office. "Trump has proposed economic and trade policies which, if enacted, would represent a sharp departure from the status quo," HSBC Global Research said. "These include sharp cuts in income and business taxes, renegotiation of trade agreements and potential tariffs on goods imported from China and Mexico, and the large-scale deportation of illegal immigrants." Fitch Ratings said Trump's victory "does not have immediate near-term implications" for the federal government's AAA bond rating. But "Trump's economic and fiscal policies would be negative for U.S. sovereign creditworthiness if they were implemented in full," Fitch said.       Comments made about this article - 0 Total Comment on this article Title: Comments: Your Name: (optional - shown on website) Advertisement Subscribe to The Recorder   E-Edition 11/15/2016 Click here to see and download more print issues The Recorder Sports Schedule Most Popular Area high school sports calendar Thursday, November 10, 2016 Election results in Montgomery County update 3 Tuesday, November 08, 2016 Republicans take Legislature Wednesday, November 09, 2016 State news in brief Friday, November 11, 2016 WWII vet shares memories Friday, November 11, 2016 3 arrested for prostitution in Amsterdam Monday, November 14, 2016 Mary Lou Abele Starace Wednesday, November 09, 2016 Deborah L.

The airline said Indonesian Civil Aviation Authorities are unable to approve the flights due to runway maintenance works.

Skip to content Satellite Press Releases Satellite Press Releases and News Southwest Airlines Recommends Shareholders Reject "Mini-Tender" Offer by TRC Capital Corporation DALLAS, Nov. 10, 2016 /PRNewswire/ — Southwest Airlines Co. (NYSE: LUV) announced today that it received notice of an unsolicited “mini-tender” offer by TRC Capital Corporation (TRC Capital) to purchase up to 2,500,000 shares, or approximately 0.4 percent of the outstanding shares, of Southwest’s common stock at a price of $38.63 per share. The offer price is 4.33 percent below the closing price per share of Southwest’s common stock on November 4, 2016, the last trading day before the offer was commenced.  TRC Capital may terminate or amend its offer if certain conditions occur, including any decrease in the market price of Southwest’s common stock from the price on the date of the offer. Southwest does not endorse TRC Capital’s unsolicited mini-tender offer and is not associated with TRC Capital, its mini-tender offer, or the mini-tender offer documents.  Because TRC Capital’s offer price is at a price below the current market price, Southwest recommends that Shareholders not tender their shares (i.e., take no action) or, if they have already tendered shares, withdraw their shares by providing the written notice described in the TRC Capital mini-tender offer documents prior to the expiration of the offer, currently scheduled for 12:01 a.m., New York City time, on Wednesday, December 7, 2016. Mini-tender offers, such as this one, are third-party offers that seek to acquire less than 5 percent of a company’s outstanding shares.  These offers typically do not provide the same investor protections required of larger tender offers, including the filing of disclosure documents with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and other procedures required by U.S. securities laws. The SEC has cautioned investors that “some bidders make mini-tender offers at below-market prices, hoping that they will catch investors off guard if the investors do not compare the offer price to the current market price.” The SEC’s guidance to investors on mini-tender offers is available at http://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/minitend.htm. TRC Capital has made many similar unsolicited mini-tender offers for shares of other public companies. Shareholders should obtain current market quotations for their shares, consult with their broker or financial advisor, and exercise caution with respect to TRC Capital’s mini-tender offer.  Southwest encourages brokers and dealers, as well as other market participants, to review the SEC’s letter regarding broker-dealer mini-tender offer dissemination and disclosure at http://www.sec.gov/divisions/marketreg/minitenders/sia072401.htm. Southwest requests that a copy of this press release be included with all distributions of materials relating to TRC Capital’s mini-tender offer related to shares of Southwest’s common stock.

Donald Trump's Election Unlikely To Delay Predator Drone Sale To India NDTV 5 days ago Written by Vishnu Som New Delhi: Donald Trump's election as America's next President is unlikely to affect talks between the US and India for the sale of state-of-the-art Predator drones for the Indian armed forces. NDTV has learned that, for the moment, the visit of the outgoing US Secretary of Defence Ashton Carter to India in December remains unchanged. During Mr Carter's visit, the two sides are expected to discuss the sale of 22 unarmed Predator B Guardian drones for maritime surveillance and possibly 100 armed Predator C Avengers for the Indian Air Force.   Dates for Secretary Carter's visit are expected to be finalised over the next few days. Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar had met him in the US in August this year, when talks on India acquiring the sensitive Predator systems were taken forward.   Progress in talks has largely been made possible by India joining the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR) in June and being declared a "major defence partner" of the US.   In pics: 5th generation fighter aircraft - the most lethal warbirds in the sky 5th generation fighter aircraft: The most lethal warbirds in the sky Secretary Carter's likely visit to India post the elections - Mr Trump will take oath in January - is unprecedented and shows how the outgoing Barack Obama administration wants to solidify the gains made in Indo-US defence ties, sources told NDTV.  At the same time, there is broad bipartisan support in the US Congress for the Predator sale, they said. The Indian Armed forces presently operate unarmed Israeli Heron and Searcher unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) or drones used for day and night-time reconnaissance missions. The Indian Air Force has for years said it needs armed drones - weapon systems that have come into sharp focus after the Uri terror attack when the Indian Army took significant risks in deploying para-commandos across the Line of Control (LoC) to take out terrorist launch pads. The government has cleared a request by the Air Force to acquire 10 Heron TPs at an estimated cost of Rs 2,620 crore from Israel. These can be fitted with weapons to engage targets on the ground such as terrorist camps. Armed with Hellfire anti-armour missiles, which can strike targets eight kilometres away, the Predator C Avenger has the ability to detect targets across the LoC and hit them while flying well within Indian airspace. Attack variants of the Predator have been used widely by US forces deployed in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Syria and Iraq in fighting terrorist forces, often through precision strikes. An extended range version of the Predator Avenger featuring a 76 foot wingspan can fly for up to 20 hours at an altitude of 50,000 feet. © Provided by NDTV 24x7 Predator C Avenger armed remotely piloted vehicle Those watching the progress of talks between India and the United States on the Predator systems point out that while the armed version of the Predator is a priority, talks are at a more advanced stage for the Indian Navy's requirement for the maritime Predator `B' Guardian. The Guardian carries an electro-optical night vision system and multi-mode maritime surveillance radar. © Provided by NDTV 24x7 Predators have been used widely by US forces deployed in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Syria and Iraq Capable of flying up to 27 hours nonstop , the Guardian can cover vast stretches along India's coast line sharing crucial intelligence data with ground or ship based operators or the Indian Navy's new Boeing P-8 I maritime reconnaissance aircraft which are equipped with torpedoes and Harpoon anti-ship missiles. China recently unveiled its new CH-5 (Rainbow 5) armed drones described by some as the world's most advanced. The CH-5 has also been cleared for export to friendly countries such as Pakistan, which is already working closely with China on its UAV programmes. © Provided by NDTV 24x7 China's new CH-5 drone cleared for export to countries like Pakistan In an interview to www.china.org.cn, a mouthpiece for the Chinese government, Shi Wen, the chief designer of the drone has said the CH-5 can remain airborne for up to 32 hours when carrying 8 AR-1 air-to-ground missiles. "Hovering above a hostile region for that long time creates enough deterrence. You can just imagine a drone carrying eight missiles and watching you from above non-stop for 24 hours," said Shi.

Related Articles O’Sullivan, Afriforum taking criminal prosecution private – targeting Myeni, Zuptas Maynard: Dudu’s wasted SAA billions could pay for 55 000 #FeesMustFall students SAA to break even by 2021 Zuma stands firm on keeping Myeni as SAA chair Myeni takes a backseat at parly briefing on SAA SAA chair Dudu Myeni: 'I never appoint myself'   Cape Town - Dudu Myeni, chairperson of South African Airways, states in a lengthy letter why she cannot resign from her position at the beleaguered state-owned airline. In a response to a question from DA MP David Maynier, Myeni says "it is in the best interest of SAA and taxpayers that I serve my prescribed full term". Here is Myeni's full response to Maynier's questions, which she sent on Thursday to the Standing Committee on Finance. LETTER:  HONOURABLE MEMBER OF DEMOCRATIC ALLIANCE, MR DAVID MAYNIER Subsequent to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Finance meeting with SAA on the 20th of September 2016, the Hon David Maynier asked a question as stated below: QUESTION: “Will the Chairperson, in the light of the preliminary report tabled today, tell us whether: a) she still believes that it is still in the best interests of the airline that she doesn’t resign, and if she believes that, b) why does she believe that?” RESPONSES: a) It is in the best interest of SAA and Taxpayers that I serve my prescribed full term. b) As stated previously, as part of their mandate, the South African Cabinet appointed the Board of South African Airways (SAA). I did not appoint myself. The SAA Chairperson therefore serves at the pleasure of the executive arm of the state (Cabinet). Importantly, SAA’s performance as reported in the financial report, presented to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Finance on 20 Septembers 2016, cannot be solely attributed to me, as current Chairperson. Objective facts dictate that SAA’s performance it is a historical consequence, underpinned by factors known to all South Africans. Further, SAA has never been capitalised and its competitive position was worsened by an  American Aviation Expert, who sold the fleet and leased them back. Such were bad decisions, which continue to haunt the airline, and quite conveniently, they are lumped on my doorstep. We still lease all our fleet from foreign countries and pay in dollars. In November 2015, the Honourable David Maynier MP, asked the same question during the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Finance hearing at which I appeared on behalf of SAA. The question posed then was “Tell us why you should not resign, (as the Chairperson). It is concerns one that this question persists without any indication as to the specific part(s) bases for the same relative to the alleged bearing on the performance of SAA in general. I shall therefore attempt to deal with the question from a broad perspective and also share some of historical challenges and achievements to date. At the outset, it is common cause that it is the prerogative of the shareholder to determine who is best to serve on the Board and my suitability, as a question, is therefore irrelevant. I accept that the Board is accountable for the performance of the company. As the “Accounting Authority”, as prescribed in the PFMA, the Board carries a well enshrined fiduciary responsibility for its own performance and that of the company. Acknowledging this responsibility against my personal prudency, as a leader, I continually reflect on my own performance in respect of SAA’s interest. I have found no sound reason not to continue to serve. As a member of a collective, I believe my contribution  has added intrinsic value to the SAA. My recent reappointment confirms the Shareholder’s confidence in my role as Chairperson. I have nothing but respect for that. There are many factors that have impaired our financial performance; while some are within our control and others are distinctly out of our control. And they are not dissimilar to what other players in our sector face. It has been established as an irrefutable fact that an airline is a capital intensive business and SAA is no exception. SAA has, for many years, been under capitalised, something acknowledged by most, including a series of former Boards. MY RESPONSE IS AS FOLLOWS: "To rephrase the BMW, Gore, Rodenstock and Royal Australian Navy case studies, no leader can lead an organisation single-handedly. "Rather, leadership is a distributed phenomenon, occurring in various parts of an organisation, just not emanating from the top." This is the constant about all organisations, nationally and globally. Similarly, the challenges of SAA cannot credibly be attributed to me as a person. Such a view is as bereft of any empirical corporate rationale as it represents a self-perpetuating narrative. Whilst this fact-free theory has no proximity to the objective facts, it has been authored and handed down to the multitudes of unsuspecting citizens, who have unquestioningly assimilated it. Whilst the status quo of non-transformation has been allowed to linger, owing largely to those who are hanging onto their ill-gotten unearned privilege, for over 22 years into the Constitutional Democracy, at the expense of the national imperatives, my term has sought to shake the R24 billion Procurement Spend benefiting 98% of the minority groups. The disadvantaged South Africans, who happen to be the majority, benefit only 2% of the R24 Billion Rand; this is absurd in any language. It is a serious concern that we preside over a State Owned Company, which continues to be dominated by one section of the society against the majority who receive crumbs from the R24bn procurement spend. Further, I have taken a dim view of the exclusive  benefits enjoyed by the pilots, as have been exposed in the leaks from SAA by those who are not happy with the Board’s moves to correct the situation. None of these glaring issues have received as much as a whimper from some people. I wonder why it is that certain issues are elevated at the expense of the supremely important issues which have a positive bearing on the envisaged state of nationhood. I am reluctant to state the obvious (that the key issues are being sneezed at owing to the fact that they tinker with the assumed unearned privilege by some). I would have therefore been a revered Chairperson had I protected the status quo; the media would be hoisting me overheads and standing ovation as the most effective Chairperson while poverty, unemployment and inequality continues to affect those in the majority and many downtrodden. My problem results from doing what is right, investigating losses, dealing with corruption and ensuring that we transform the hugely skewed SAA. I therefore respectfully submit that I will not resign. What has not been asked is how SAA found itself into this situation and how the Board has navigated to keep the airline afloat 2. Historical constraints Looking at the history of the SAA in the period 1998 to 2003 in particular, one realises that the decisions taken by erstwhile CEO, management and board, set the tone for the underperformance of the company in the next 18 years. The 2002/03 performance of the SAA realised billions of rands of earnings achieved through fuel hedging contracts. These earnings could not be attributable to operational performance but were a result of mainly currency and fuel price movements, with speculative hedging as the driver. In the subsequent financial year, having achieved huge earnings, the SAA locked itself further in hedging contracts, some of which lasted for up to 10 years. This saw SAA incurring hedging losses in excess of R5bn as the rand unexpectedly strengthened from around R13 to the US dollar to around R6.00 to the  dollar. The Government was therefore compelled to issue guarantees in access of R3 billion to cover SAA’s debts. The SAA’s balance sheet was severely weakened, and as a result Transnet, the former holding company instituted an investigation into the SAA’s hedging activities. This resulted in suspensions and resignations of senior executives including the CFO. The oil hedge losses of 2004 to 2010 are calculated to have amounted to R8 billion. This was under Mr Viljoen, when SAA suffered such losses. SAA has ever since relied on financial support from the shareholder in the form of government guarantees. Equity and reserves continued to be negatively impacted with the concomitant adverse impact on solvency. Some people suddenly found their  loudest voices when they were patently silent when the company was being run down by the “so called” Aviation Experts, who happen to be from America and trusted as they were of colour. a) Today, SAA has settled a debt, which resulted from decisions made in 2000 -  the courts ruled in favour of Nationwide Airline. And I am not there when all the seeds of unprofitability were planted. b) A portion of SAA was sold to SWISS Air, another poor decision which resulted in a fiasco, which purported to privatise SAA in part, another call for the DA. I was not there. c) The Pilot Evergreen Contracts, which consume billions from the revenues, represent a hobbling historical decision. I never signed those contracts, yet the DA finds a scapegoat in me for all these things. 2.1.  Mismanagement Around 1998, SAA sought the services of an American, Mr Coleman Andrews, who then assumed the position of leadership of the airline. It is common knowledge that the Andrews’ era was a clear disaster. Corporate governance and sound business decision- making became a challenge and a risk which continue to erode the value of the business. During this period, SAA paid more than R1-billion (in expenditure) without realising any return for it. There were allegations of nepotism, wasteful expenditure and poor business decisions  with regard to the appointment of consultants, Baine Capital, employment of staff,  including expatriates, and decision-making based on factors beyond the mandate and business imperatives of the SAA. The allegations stemmed from, among others, the disclosure that Andrews, a founding member of Bain Capital, had appointed Bain and Company as consultants to SAA, and had not disclosed this relationship with the consulting firm to the board at the time of his appointment. During this period, the consultant Baine Capital, became the largest recipient of consultant payments from SAA, totaling R243 million. In addition, nine expatriates were employed at a cost of R118 million. The expatriates, who formed the core leadership of SAA between 1998 and 2001, at the expense of local and experienced managers, also enjoyed inflated performance bonuses, although there were no auditable performance measures in place. The majority of appointments of consultants did not comply with the SAA’s tender procedures and PFMA, and no questions about such contraventions. Mr Andrews agreed to pay performance-related fees to the consultants despite the fact that there were no performance measures in place, and also conflicted. In addition, SAA reported profits of R350-million during the Board and former CEO, Coleman Andrews’ tenure. However, it turned out that this reported profit resulted from aircraft sales and lease backs, which had never been the core business of SAA. If this item (aircraft sales) was removed from the books, the SAA showed a loss for that year. Having been stripped of assets including aircraft, SAA’s balance sheet became weaker over time, since the cash realised from the aircraft sales was used to cover operational costs rather than buy assets.SAA had to later seek funding to buy new aircrafts. At the time, there was no identifiable turnaround strategy to be spoken of, other than the stripping and selling of SAA’s assets. This was not profit, but a pure and simple sale of the most prized assets of the airline. It is in this era that SAA switched from sourcing aircrafts from Airbus to Boeing without a fathomable business case advanced. Notwithstanding these disastrous decisions, the board gave Coleman Andrews more than R220-million in earnings during his 20-month stay at SAA – a record-breaking feat viewed against a questionable return on investment and decisions which continue to haunt the future of the airline. Over and above that, Coleman Andrews had contracted Baine Capital Consulting to help turn SAA around, without disclosing that he was part of the same company, as a co-founder. He paid the consulting firm over 200m. To be fair, Mr Andrews didn’t make these decisions on his own, but he had the full Board to support him. It appears, some people are allowed to elevate certain issues to serve certain interest with impunity. If we truly represent the honest interest of this nation, let us ask genuine questions which are informed by the objective issues and circumstances. There are dominant share of voices on SAA issues, but some could be scored zero in relation to the real risks affecting SAA. The issue here is SAA pays for all its fleet, 65. The performance of SAA in the 2014/15 financial year is inextricably linked to the historical performance of the airline of at least the past 18 years. The past three Boards of Directors and management teams of SAA have continued to be constrained by these historical decisions, whose impact continues to permeate the operations of SAA to date. 2.2. Hedging contracts SAA continues to face hedging losses as a result of plummeting global oil prices and currency movements. These can hardly be placed at the doorstep of management and the immediate past Board of Directors. The ripple effects of the past fuel hedging decisions coupled with the weak currency continue to impact adversely SAA’s ability to reap the benefits of low oil prices. Fuel remains SAA’s single biggest variable cost and will remain so for some time to come. 3. Current constraints 3.1. Liquidity constraints In the past financial year, SAA’s ability to raise funding for its operations was severely affected by factors beyond the powers of management and the Board. With a balance sheet that had been severely eroded by past operational and strategic decisions, the SAA could not raise funding. This had, as a result, led to SAA requesting an extension of the guarantee from the shareholder, in itself leading to unjustified views that the SAA was a drain to the fiscus. This was a mistaken belief that SAA received cash transfers from the fiscus; a fallacy willfully peddled by just a few who choose to ignore good efforts. Going forward, it is envisaged that the turnaround strategy will go a long way in not only stabilizing the SAA, but also propelling it to the path of sustainability. Be that as it may, it is critically important to ensure (as the deputy Minister of Finance intimated) that the current Board be given space to lead the SAA to stability. 3.2. Transformation/ Evergreen contracts Transformation relating both to procurement of goods and services for SAA and employment equity remain some of the biggest challenges facing the airline today. The powerful vested interests have used every means available to defend and further entrench their positions to the exclusion of the majority of the people. In the process, the Board, and particularly, current, as Chairperson, have been attacked by various forums including the media. The SAA Pilots’ Association has used every means to resist the attempts to restructure the pilots’ unprecedented evergreen contracts that are a significant drain on the cash-flow of SAA. The pilots are costing the SAA in excess of R600 million per year in excessive guaranteed benefits - constituting a huge chunk of the losses SAA recorded in the financial report table in Parliament on the 20th September 2016. The structure of these agreements is such that even if SAA were to be sold to another shareholder, they(the agreements) would continue to bind the new shareholder. It is a matter of public record that the SAA Pilot’s Association recently petitioned the courts to stop the Board from slashing their benefits. SAA buys cars for Pilots. Yet again this matter, which threatens the sustainability of SAA, is a non-issue for those who continue to attack the airlines leadership. Why? 4. ACHIEVEMENTS TO DATE 4.1 It is under our tenure that we resolved to commission an investigation into financial losses of SAA. This has been the most successful intervention, as it has unearthed a lot of historical corruption. The extent is that some people decided to resign than face disciplinary hearings and/or being fired as a consequence. 4.2 It is under our tenure, that we resolved to commission an investigation into procurement, where we discovered that many contracts were as old as 1993, they never get advertised, and they continue to be extended without testing the market and also exploring options for transformation. 4.3 We appointed a Black Chief Pilot for the first time in the 82 years of history of the Airline. 4.4 We continue to find ways to grow the airline, albeit all negative media reportage, but we have managed to expand in Africa, we increased frequencies, and added more routes, such as Abudja in Nigeria, and a new Ghana/Washington Route during our tenure. Route profitability is a key yardstick. Recently we completed a network and fleet review conducted by an international organisation. It is evident that that had SAA been able to introduce new generation aircraft on its international routes these routes would almost immediately turn to profit. I would also like to make the point that SAA is an incredibly efficient operation. Our flights take off and land on time. Our passengers enjoy our superior service and we  lose less baggage today than we regrettably did historically. We are a reliable airline and few would disagree.SAA is revered all over the world and is still the leading Airline on the continent. I urge those members of the society, in particular to refrain from making reckless statements which serve nothing but erode the value for SAA. Any emerging economy, or developing country without its own National Carrier does not progress well economically and in the tourism space. I will be the first one to admit that we have some serious challenges. But we have overcome many more, in a number of key areas and this is illustrated by a measureable improvement. I cannot take credit for these improvements, as an individual, as these results emanate from the efforts of our vision, contribution made by our loyal employees, customer support and suppliers. This airline is not the product of one or a few people but a collective of various teams working in concert with each other. Ultimately, the South African Government who is the sole shareholder. SAA is a proud airline. We facilitate the efficient movement of millions of South Africans and foreign visitors. We all share the responsibility to promote its sustainability and this includes all South Africans. When we are attacked unfairly we dent our valuable image  and brand. I am proud and equally humbled to have been entrusted with the responsibility to serve; I don’t take this for granted and, to this end, I will continue to give my best for the duration of my term as Chairperson. 4. Conclusion As I conclude, I request that the Honourable Member join SAA to root out institutionalized corruption and lack of transformation. SAA has fully subscribed to the OECD and we have rolled out the Anti corruption and bribery compliance workshops into the whole company and its subsidiaries. This is the commitment the Board made and therefore, this should auger well to those who support such actions like our Honourable Member, Mr Maynier, and indeed, we will equally expect support to the Boards Transformation Agenda, to balance the 24 Billion Procurement Spend to benefit poor majority South Africans.

(Photo/David A. Barnes) The smoke from North Georgia’s forest fires filled the air at Georgia’s Equestrian Complex. Despite the air, No. 4 Georgia beat No. 2 Auburn, 11-7, to earn its first Southeastern Conference win of the season. Georgia (3-1,1-2 SEC) and Auburn (3-2, 1-1) competed neck and neck throughout the entire day on Friday. With high scoring points throughout the entire match, the level of play between the teams kept raising higher and higher until the last match.   “It’s a big accomplishment,” sophomore Graysen Stroud said. “We’ve worked really hard for all of this.”  Both teams were tied until it reached reining and equitation on the flat, but Georgia swept Auburn 4-0 in reining.    Georgia senior Claudia Spreng sealed the deal for Georgia with her 76-75 victory against Auburn’s Ali Fratessa.  Georgia demolished Auburn throughout the fencing. Auburn was only able to capture one win from the Bulldogs. With all of Auburn’s riders having its career high for horsemanship, Georgia fell to Auburn in that event.   “There is always pressure facing a SEC team,” sophomore Emma Mandarino said. “We utilized the nerves in positive ways and made ourselves better.   Mandarino won Most Outstanding Performance (MOP) for her ride in equitation over fences with a score of 88-82. Mandarino wasn’t the only Bulldog to win MOP, as Stroud won a MOP in horsemanship with her score of 78-76.5  “It’s a big accomplishment,” Stroud said. “We gave it our best and it paid off.”  Last week, Georgia fell to No. 1 Texas A&M, which was its toughest loss of the season.  Today was an important match up for the Bulldogs to defeat the Tigers and grab its first SEC win. The need to win today was key for its ability to get through the recent losses.  “Our competition lit us up, and we were hungry to win,” Stroud said. “We hit a rough patch and this set us up for success for the rest of the year.”  Georgia handed Auburn its second loss of the season and its second SEC lost. Its first loss was also against Texas A&M.  “I don’t even think of it as a SEC win,” head coach Meghan Boeing said. “I think of it as just a ride a great day and great competition.” Georgia faces one more match of the fall semester away at South Dakota State. Boeing said she feels the team is at the right spot for a halfway mark of the season. Georgia equestrian to compete against defending national champion On Friday, Georgia equestrian will have one of its toughest meets of the season. No. 2 Auburn, the 2016 NCEA national champions, will go head-to-head with No. 4 Georgia at the UGA Equestrian Complex.  No. 3 Georgia equestrian falls to No. 1 Texas A&M On Saturday, Georgia equestrian struggled to get points on the board throughout  its away meet against Texas A&M as the No. 1 Aggies defeated No. 3 Georgia 13-7 at the Hildebrand Equine Complex.  Georgia equestrian defeats New Mexico State in 3rd meet of season As the lyrics “I’m unstoppable today” by Sia played over the speakers, Georgia’s sweep in horsemanship was announced. The 5-0 sweep concluded the first half of the meet. Georgia didn’t stop there. As the song suggested, Georgia remained unstoppable throughout the second half of the meet against New Mexico State. Georgia won 17-2.

The Stock Market Is Buying President-Elect Trump's Big Infrastructure Promises Forbes 5 days ago Steve Schaefer, Forbes Staff © President-elect Donald Trump at the U.S. Capitol on Nov. 10. (Nicholas Kamm/AFP/Getty Images) Donald Trump swept into the White House on a wave of support from voters who feel like the world’s increasingly globalized economy left them behind as manufacturing and industrial jobs left U.S. shores over the last three-plus decades. Popular Searches Boeing Co BA ▼ 148.11 -1.88 -1.25% Apple Inc AAPL ▲ 107.11 +1.40 +1.32% Carmike Cinemas Inc CKEC ▲ 34.10 +0.05 +0.15% Walt Disney Co DIS ▼ 97.70 -0.22 -0.22% Judging from the action in stocks since Election Day, the market is betting that president-elect Trump will deliver on at least some of his promises to reverse that trend. Look no further than the stark outperformance of the Dow Jones industrial average over the last two trading sessions. The Dow coasted into Thursday’s closing bell at record highs, up more than 1% for the session, while the S&P 500 notched only a slim gain and the Nasdaq Composite actually declined. A crucial difference between the indexes: the 30-stock Dow is heavy on financial and industrial names and relatively light in technology. Dow component Caterpillar, up nearly 11% in just the last two days, is looking like a growth stock while tech heavyweights Alphabet, Amazon.com and Facebook have slumped since the election. In his victory speech in the wee hours of Wednesday morning, Trump offered up thoughts that set the stage for a surging industrial sector. “We are going to fix our inner cities and rebuild our highways, bridges, tunnels, airports, schools, hospitals. We’re going to rebuild our infrastructure, which will become, by the way, second to none. And we will put millions of our people to work as we rebuild it.,” Trump said, and any kind of big spending program in that realm would benefit the makers of construction equipment, building supplies and materials. In that respect, the rally in stocks like Caterpillar may not be so different from the advance they started in the spring of 2009 when President Obama’s big stimulus package was winning headlines with its focus on “shovel-ready” projects, a pledge that would become a punchline. Traders are ready to believe in Trump though, presuming the big rally of the past two days indicates approval. Only financials performed better than the industrial sector’s 2% gain Thursday, as bank stocks benefited from the prospect that regulatory reforms enacted since the financial crisis will be lightened or eliminated and, more importantly, a steepening yield curve. The industrials group, though, could keep rallying provided Trump’s infrastructure message doesn’t fall by the wayside amid plans to repeal Obamacare and Dodd-Frank. Perhaps most importantly, a spending plan that would go toward building and repairing roads, bridges, tunnels and other critical infrastructure is one of the few planks on which Trump and Hillary Clintion found some common ground. Morgan Stanley strategists advised clients own industrial stocks in a post-election report, citing the likelihood of “excitement in the coming weeks about some additional infrastructure spending, an area where there appears to be some common ground.” The firm highlighted defense stocks like General Dynamics, Northrop Grumman and Boeing, and said the broader industrial group’s earnings expectations “don’t appear to be excessively optimistic.” Among the stocks leading the charge on Thursday: Lighting systems maker Acuity Brands, aluminum producer Arconic, water equipment provider Pentair, conglomerate Emerson Electric and toolmaker Stanley Black & Decker.

Related News/Archive County sale of 'surplus' property will bring several changes to Istachatta 3 Months Ago Pinellas County buys 7 acres of Lealman property for affordable housing 8 Months Ago Amazon property in Ruskin sells for $103.6 million, biggest industrial sale in Tampa Bay history 5 Months Ago With a $10.1 million price, the county and Industrial Realty Group are working to finalize the sale of the Young-Rainey Science, Technology and Research, or STAR Center, a 96-acre manufacturing and technology campus the county owns on Bryan Dairy Road. The Los Angeles firm manages more than 120 properties in 28 states, with more than 100 million square feet of rentable space. The firm specializes in turning shuttered military bases and industrial complexes into centers that attract jobs from national corporations. Three of IRG's projects under way in Ohio are estimated to be worth $1 billion. County commissioners voted 5-1 in late September to sell the property that went on the market last year. The federal government gave the complex to Pinellas County in 1995. "Our rich Uncle Sam gave us a gift 21 years ago," County Administrator Mark Woodard told the commissioners. "The facility is about as good as it will ever be. It is pure profit." The proceeds from the sale could come in the first quarter of 2017 and would be applied to economic development. County leaders would then hold workshops to discuss the best ways to spend the money. The complex currently features eight buildings totaling nearly 662,000 square feet and about 7 acres of developable land. IRG would have to honor the current leases of the 30 tenants, including Raytheon, which develops and produces communication devices. Raytheon accounts for most of the jobs on the site and has leasing options for up to 18 years. The proposed deal could also bring the county an additional $750,000 each time Raytheon renews a lease every five years before 2032. A building's reserve fund of $1.5 million would also go back to redevelopment, officials said. Currently, Raytheon accounts for about 1,000 of the 1,200 jobs on the property. Two developers bid on the proposal, and both were within $80,000 of each other. A drawback to keeping the building is future repairs could cost $7 million, said economic development director Mike Meidel. He estimated the facility's economic impact each year at about $100 million, including payroll and taxes. The county expects to pay about $50,000 in closing costs. "The facility is really only worth what a buyer is willing to pay," Meidel said. Commissioner Karen Seel voted against the sale and feared the developer would flip the property to another buyer. "I just don't think we got the price that we deserve for this property," Seel said. "They don't have a track record of doing that," Woodard said, adding that he can't guarantee a future sale won't happen. One of the firm's biggest projects includes the former McClellan Air Force Base in California, now called McClellan Park. After buying the property from Sacramento County in 2000, the firm turned the base into a multiuse business park with about 8.5 million square feet of buildings. The firm has now leased more than 5 million square feet of commercial, industrial, and aviation space there. Tenants include Boeing, Northrop Grumman, Raytheon and the Department of Agriculture. IRG said the project has created more than 8,000 jobs. In Ohio, the firm developed Goodyear's world headquarters in Akron. A few miles south in Canton, IRG redeveloped the 88-acre site of the old headquarters of the Hoover Vacuum Co. In addition, the company is in the middle of a $500 million project at the Pro Football Hall of Fame campus, called Hall of Fame Village. Commissioner Ken Welch quizzed IRG leaders on their plans. The firm "buys and holds real estate" and is not a flipper, senior vice president Debra Harrell said. "Our core business is adaptive reuse," Harrell said. "We have the capital to reinvest."

Image: David Leiser, CC BY-NC-ND 2.0 China Dialogue Thursday 10 November 2016 Share this story Carbon emissions from aviation are growing faster than any other sector. In an effort to address the problem, the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) approved the world’s first global emissions reduction scheme last month. The Carbon Offset and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) is a market-based mechanism in which carbon emissions are offset through the purchase of credits, leaving aviation emissions to remain – at least on paper – at 2020 levels. Aviation currently accounts for just 2 per cent of total carbon dioxide emissions globally, about half of which is from international aviation. However, without effective measures, aviation could account for about 22 per cent of all emissions by 2050, according to projections from Greenovation Hub, an environmental non-governmental organisation. The aviation sector is growing rapidly, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) predict that the number of airline passengers will more than double by 2034 to 7.3 billion, up from 3.5 billion in 2015. China will account for a significant proportion of the growth in passenger numbers. IATA expect that 20 per cent of passengers will be travelling to, from or within China by 2034. China is also predicted to overtake the US as the world’s largest aviation market for passengers by 2024. Passenger numbers are expected to double from current levels to over 900 million by 2025 and to 1.3 billion by 2035. The US market, in comparison, is expected to increase from just over 650 million passengers in 2015 to 900 million passengers. To address this rapid growth, the CORSIA calls for international aviation to supplement efforts to reduce emissions from within the aviation sector with additional off-setting through a market-based mechanism. The CORSIA will begin with a trial from 2021 to 2023 and then a first stage from 2024 to 2026. Both the trial and first stage will be voluntary, meaning airlines worldwide will have a decade to prepare for the start of the scheme in 2027. At this point countries will need to purchase emissions credits to keep sector emissions at the 2020 level. There will be some exceptions to the scheme: countries with minimal aviation traffic, least-developed nations, and island and landlocked developing nations will all be exempt. Like shipping, the cross-border nature of international aviation has made finding agreement on limiting emissions especially challenging. The sector was not covered in the Paris Agreement so the CORSIA will be the key driver of emissions reduction. WWF China described the deal as “an important step for reduction of aviation emissions.” As of October 12, 66 nations, including China, and together accounting for 86.5 per cent of international aviation emissions, had signed up to the CORSIA trial. Russia and India have said they will not participate in the voluntary phases. Limited headroom for cuts The main challenge in curbing aviation emissions is that improvements in technology, operational efficiency and the development of sustainable alternative fuels will be unable to keep pace with passenger growth, meaning an increase in overall carbon emissions. Andrew Murphy, aviation officer with Transport and Environment, a sustainable transportation body, told chinadialogue: “For the next few years, it’s expected that passenger demand will grow around 4-6 per cent a year, while efficiencies will improve by about 1-2 per cent a year.” Even under ICAO’s most optimistic modelling scenario for technological and operational improvements, international aviation is expected to increase carbondioxide (CO2) emissions by 523 million tonnes by 2040 or 1039 million tonnes by 2050, based on projected emissions in 2020. The solution to this emissions gap is to utilise carbon off-setting so that passenger growth can continue unfettered whilst keeping aviation emissions at 2020 levels. This approach has been criticised by some EU law makers as lacking ambition because carbon trading under the CORSIA scheme will not lead to a reduction in emissions on 2020 levels. There are also concerns about whether CORSIA will even incentivise airlines to change. Andrew Murphy is concerned that low carbon prices and overall costs won’t provide sufficient incentives for airlines to use better technology and optimise routes. ICAO calculations show that by 2035 airlines worldwide will be spending just 0.5 per cent to 1.4 per cent of their total costs on carbon abatement. This is less than the impact of fluctuations in the price of oil. There are also concerns that the CORSIA will fail to maintain emissions at 2020 levels. Greenovation Hub and WWF claim that the CORSIA may see emissions traded with projects that actually do little to reduce carbon emissions or that have damaging environmental impacts. Ensuring that the aviation sector only purchases credits that guarantee real and long-term reductions in emissions will be challenging. It is also the case that projects selling carbon credits may have broader negative environmental impacts. WWF China also point out that the CORSIA and the targets in the Paris Agreement’s to reduce global warming to 2C or 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. This means the actual contribution of the aviation industry toward cutting emissions will remain undetermined. “ For the next few years, it’s expected that passenger demand will grow around 4-6 per cent a year, while efficiencies will improve by about 1-2 per cent a year. Andrew Murphy, aviation officer, Transport and Environment A level playing field for developing nations Despite the low overall costs of the scheme, the price of participation will be higher for developing nations, where aviation is expanding more rapidly, than for developed nations. WWF China has pointed out that under the CORSIA, developed nations are responsible for historical emissions. A proposal submitted to ICAO by Russia noted that aviation is expanding at a higher rate in some developing countries than in developed ones where aviation industries have had longer to mature. Furthermore, developed nation airlines make much higher profits than those in Africa. The argument goes that additional financial burdens on developing nation airlines would hamper their development and offer an unfair advantage to established aviation industries. Wang Changyi, head of the development planning department at the Civil Aviation Administration of China, said at the 2015 China Civil Aviation Development Forum that passenger numbers in China had grown by 10 per cent a year during the 12th Five Year Plan (2011-2015). As China uses mostly imported Boeing and Airbus aircraft on international routes, the country itself can do little to cut emissions. To resolve this issue, ICAO has used a “dynamic approach” to calculating carbon off-sets. Between 2021 and 2029 airlines will not be expected to benchmark themselves against their own emissions, but rather against an industry average. Over time the airlines’ performance will become more important, and by 2035 they will be responsible for the bulk (70 per cent) of their emissions. Chai Qimin, deputy director of the strategic planning department at the NDRC’s National Centre for Climate Change Strategy and International Cooperation told chinadialogue that the rapid growth of Chinese airlines is unlikely to continue in the long-term, and if extra emissions are distributed based on an industry average, Chinese firms will not see severe cost increases. The specific details of the scheme such as costs for carbon credits are still being determined, and developing nations still have time to discuss the balancing of their development rights and industry-wide emissions cuts in future talks.
