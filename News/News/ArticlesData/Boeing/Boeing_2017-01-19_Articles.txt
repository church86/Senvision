Like this story, share it with millions of investors on M3 China says can resolve trade disputes with new US government Trump, who is sworn into office on Friday, has criticised China's trade practices and threatened to impose punitive tariffs on Chinese imports. Post Your Comments Share Cancel China and the United States can resolve any trade disputes through talks, the government said on Thursday, as a Chinese newspaper warned US business could be targets for retaliation in any trade war ushered in by President-elect Donald Trump. Trump, who is sworn into office on Friday, has criticised China's trade practices and threatened to impose punitive tariffs on Chinese imports. Billionaire investor Wilbur Ross, Trump's choice for commerce secretary, voiced sharp criticism of China's trade practices on Wednesday, telling senators he would seek new ways of combating them. Chinese Commerce Ministry spokesman Sun Jiwen said the government was willing to work with the new US administration to promote the healthy development of commercial ties. "I believe China and the United States can resolve any disputes through dialogue and negotiation and that the China-US commercial relationship will not significantly stray from the path of mutual benefit," Sun told reporters. "Both sides benefit with cooperation, and both are hurt with conflict," he added. But an influential state-run newspaper took a harsher line. In an editorial, the Global Times said that as the United States has the stronger economy, China may suffer more once a trade war starts, but China "will take the US on to the end". "There are few cases in modern history where only one party surrendered in a trade war; rather, the two parties ended up compromising with each other. How could Trump's team believe China would surrender without any countermeasures?" it said. "The arrogant Trump team has underestimated China's ability to retaliate. China is a major buyer of American cotton, wheat, beans and Boeing aircraft," the paper added in the editorial carried in its Chinese and English-language editions, without elaborating. Boeing Co's China office declined to comment. Boeing anticipates China will need 6,800 new jetliners worth USD1 trillion over the next 20 years. In October, Boeing and Chinese planemaker Commercial Aircraft Corp of China Ltd (COMAC) signed an agreement to open a Boeing 737 completion facility in the Chinese coastal city of Zhoushan. The widely-read Global Times, run by the ruling Communist Party's official People's Daily, is known for its stridently nationalist tone, but its editorials cannot be viewed as representing government policies or official statements. In recent weeks, the Global Times and other state-run Chinese news outlets have issued several warnings of possible retaliation if the Trump administration carries out threats of tariffs or undermines Beijing's claims on self-ruled Taiwan. In November, the Global Times warned that China could switch large orders from Boeing to Europe, Apple phones would "essentially be crowded out" and US soybeans and corn banished from China if Trump creates problems for China on trade. China is the world's top producer and consumer of cotton and top buyer of grains such as soybeans to feed its vast livestock industry.

NASA is "considering contracting" with Boeing on a noncompetitive basis, primarily because there may not be a suitable alternative. The Chicago-based aerospace firm has ties with Russia, allowing it to serve as a middleman to get American astronauts on board the Soyuz (Russian for 'union'). Particularly, Boeing won the seats NASA now seeks from Energia, a Russian aerospace firm, in a settlement negotiated in late 2016. "Only Russian spacecraft carry people to [ISS] right now," according to NASA's website. The transportation services include one astronaut in the fall of this year and another in the spring of 2018, according to a document published by the General Services Administration (GSA). Procuring seats on the Soyuz will "maximize ISS science utilization," it notes. The Soyuz space capsule sits atop a rocket that launches Japanese, Canadian, Russian, and American astronauts from Earth into space in just nine minutes, NASA notes. Passengers can expect to arrive at ISS in six hours, about an hour shorter than a flight from New York to London. Boeing's Starliner spacecraft has encountered design flaws in development, postponing the company's manned flight to ISS until December 2018. Elon Musk's SpaceX firm delayed their first mission to the space station after an unmanned Falcon 9 spacecraft blew up in the middle of a test launch. As a result, the US continues to rely on Russia, a source of ire for many US lawmakers. The prospect of continued domestic provocations aimed at Moscow could, however, very well endanger Americans on the space station. Some of the services GSA and NASA want to acquire include "provision of Emergency Rescue services, on-orbit rescue services for the duration of the six-month missions," and, of course, bringing the astronauts back home. This is a key piece of leverage Moscow has over Washington in the undesirable event of escalated tensions. Washington has significant financial incentive to send explorers up to ISS on spacecraft that are not Russian. Since 2006, the price of a seat on the Soyuz has jumped from $25 million to $81 million, according to NASA data. NASA and GSA did score a coup in 2007 and 2008, however, when the agencies landed seats for a mere $21.8 million.

Trump, who is sworn into office on Friday, has criticised China's trade practices and threatened to impose punitive tariffs on Chinese imports. Billionaire investor Wilbur Ross, Trump's choice for commerce secretary, voiced sharp criticism of China's trade practices on Wednesday, telling senators he would seek new ways of combating them. Chinese Commerce Ministry spokesman Sun Jiwen said the government was willing to work with the new U.S. administration to promote the healthy development of commercial ties. "I believe China and the United States can resolve any disputes through dialogue and negotiation and that the China-U.S. commercial relationship will not significantly stray from the path of mutual benefit," Sun told reporters. "Both sides benefit with cooperation, and both are hurt with conflict," he added. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said any disputes should be resolved via constructive talks, to avoid any miscalculations. "We look forward to working hard with the new U.S. government, adhering to no clashes and no confrontation," she told a separate briefing. But a high-powered economist and a widely-read state-run newspaper took a harsher line. Chen Wenling, chief economist at the China Centre for International Economic Exchanges, an influential think tank with close government ties, said China does not desire a trade war but it is certainly not afraid of one. "If you want a fight, then we will fight and we will fight to the end," Chen said. "But the U.S. will be the first to be injured and their injuries will be more severe," she said, adding that China could "definitely defeat the U.S." In an editorial, the Global Times said that as the United States has the stronger economy, China may suffer more once a trade war starts, but China "will take the U.S. on to the end". "There are few cases in modern history where only one party surrendered in a trade war; rather, the two parties ended up compromising with each other. How could Trump's team believe China would surrender without any countermeasures?" it said. "The arrogant Trump team has underestimated China's ability to retaliate. China is a major buyer of American cotton, wheat, beans and Boeing aircraft," the paper added in the editorial carried in its Chinese and English-language editions, without elaborating. Boeing Co's China office declined to comment. Boeing anticipates China will need 6,800 new jetliners worth $1 trillion over the next 20 years. In October, Boeing and Chinese planemaker Commercial Aircraft Corp of China Ltd (COMA) signed an agreement to open a Boeing 737 completion facility in the Chinese coastal city of Zhou. The Global Times, run by the ruling Communist Party's official People's Daily, is known for its stridently nationalist tone, but its editorials cannot be viewed as representing government policies or official statements. In recent weeks, the Global Times and other state-run Chinese news outlets have issued several warnings of possible retaliation if the Trump administration carries out threats of tariffs or undermines Beijing's claims on self-ruled Taiwan. In November, the Global Times warned that China could switch large orders from Boeing to Europe, Apple phones would "essentially be crowded out" and U.S. soybeans and corn banished from China if Trump creates problems for China on trade. China is the world's top producer and consumer of cotton and top buyer of grains such as soybeans to feed its vast livestock industry.

Africa América Latina عربي Argentina Brasil Canada 中国 Deutschland España France India Italia 日本 México РОССИЯ United Kingdom United States Market News | Wed Jan 18, 2017 | 8:41pm EST Chinese paper warns Boeing, U.S. agriculture in crosshairs of Trump trade war BEIJING Jan 19 An influential Chinese state-run newspaper on Thursday again warned that U.S. aircraft manufacturer Boeing Co and U.S. agricultural imports could be targets for retaliation in any trade war ushered in by U.S. President-elect Donald Trump. Trump, who is sworn into office on Friday, has criticised China's trade practices and threatened to impose punitive tariffs on Chinese imports. Billionaire investor Wilbur Ross, Trump's choice for commerce secretary, voiced sharp criticism of China's trade practices on Wednesday, telling senators he would seek new ways of combating them. In an editorial, the Global Times said that as the United States has the stronger economy, China may suffer more once a trade war starts, but China "will take the U.S. on to the end". "There are few cases in modern history where only one party surrendered in a trade war; rather, the two parties ended up compromising with each other. How could Trump's team believe China would surrender without any countermeasures?" it said. "The arrogant Trump team has underestimated China's ability to retaliate. China is a major buyer of American cotton, wheat, beans and Boeing aircraft," the paper added in the editorial carried in its Chinese and English-language editions, without elaborating. Boeing's China office declined to comment. Boeing anticipates China will need 6,800 new jetliners worth $1 trillion over the next 20 years. In October, Boeing and Chinese planemaker Commercial Aircraft Corp of China Ltd (COMAC) signed an agreement to open a Boeing 737 completion facility in the Chinese coastal city of Zhoushan. The widely-read Global Times, run by the ruling Communist Party's official People's Daily, is known for its stridently nationalist tone, but its editorials cannot be viewed as representing government policies or official statements. In recent weeks, the Global Times and other state-run Chinese news outlets have issued several warnings of possible retaliation if the Trump administration carries out threats of tariffs or undermines Beijing's claims on self-ruled Taiwan. In November, the Global Times warned China could switch large orders from Boeing to Europe, Apple phones would "essentially be crowded out" and U.S. soybeans and corn banished from China if Trump creates problems for China on trade. China's the world's top producer and consumer of cotton and top buyer of grains like soybeans to feed its vast livestock industry.

Trump, who is sworn into office on Friday, has criticized China's trade practices and threatened to impose punitive tariffs on Chinese imports. Billionaire investor Wilbur Ross, Trump's choice for commerce secretary, voiced sharp criticism of China's trade practices on Wednesday, telling senators he would seek new ways of combating them. Chinese Commerce Ministry spokesman Sun Jiwen said the government was willing to work with the new U.S. administration to promote the healthy development of commercial ties. "I believe China and the United States can resolve any disputes through dialogue and negotiation and that the China-U.S. commercial relationship will not significantly stray from the path of mutual benefit," Sun told reporters. "Both sides benefit with cooperation, and both are hurt with conflict," he added. But an influential state-run newspaper took a harsher line. In an editorial, the Global Times said that as the United States has the stronger economy, China may suffer more once a trade war starts, but China "will take the U.S. on to the end". "There are few cases in modern history where only one party surrendered in a trade war; rather, the two parties ended up compromising with each other. How could Trump's team believe China would surrender without any countermeasures?" it said. "The arrogant Trump team has underestimated China's ability to retaliate. China is a major buyer of American cotton, wheat, beans and Boeing aircraft," the paper added in the editorial carried in its Chinese and English-language editions, without elaborating. Boeing Co's China office declined to comment. Boeing anticipates China will need 6,800 new jetliners worth $1 trillion over the next 20 years. In October, Boeing and Chinese planemaker Commercial Aircraft Corp of China Ltd (COMAC) [CMAFC.UL] signed an agreement to open a Boeing 737 completion facility in the Chinese coastal city of Zhoushan. The widely-read Global Times, run by the ruling Communist Party's official People's Daily, is known for its stridently nationalist tone, but its editorials cannot be viewed as representing government policies or official statements. In recent weeks, the Global Times and other state-run Chinese news outlets have issued several warnings of possible retaliation if the Trump administration carries out threats of tariffs or undermines Beijing's claims on self-ruled Taiwan. In November, the Global Times warned that China could switch large orders from Boeing to Europe, Apple phones would "essentially be crowded out" and U.S. soybeans and corn banished from China if Trump creates problems for China on trade. China is the world's top producer and consumer of cotton and top buyer of grains such as soybeans to feed its vast livestock industry.

Trump, who is sworn into office on Friday, has criticised China's trade practices and threatened to impose punitive tariffs on Chinese imports.

"I believe China and the United States can resolve any disputes through dialogue and negotiation and that the China-U.S. commercial relationship will not significantly stray from the path of mutual benefit," Sun told reporters. "Both sides benefit with cooperation, and both are hurt with conflict," he added. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said any disputes should be resolved via constructive talks, to avoid any miscalculations. "We look forward to working hard with the new U.S. government, adhering to no clashes and no confrontation," she told a separate briefing. But a high-powered economist and a widely-read state-run newspaper took a harsher line. Chen Wenling, chief economist at the China Centre for International Economic Exchanges, an influential think tank with close government ties, said China does not desire a trade war but it is certainly not afraid of one. "If you want a fight, then we will fight and we will fight to the end," Chen said. "But the U.S. will be the first to be injured and their injuries will be more severe," she said, adding that China could "definitely defeat the U.S." In an editorial, the Global Times said that as the United States has the stronger economy, China may suffer more once a trade war starts, but China "will take the U.S. on to the end". "There are few cases in modern history where only one party surrendered in a trade war; rather, the two parties ended up compromising with each other. How could Trump's team believe China would surrender without any countermeasures?" it said. "The arrogant Trump team has underestimated China's ability to retaliate.

Photo: AFP mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 11:07 AM, January 19, 2017 Updated: 11:11 AM, January 19, 2017 WASHINGTON — Billionaire investor Wilbur Ross, United States President-elect Donald Trump's choice for commerce secretary, voiced sharp criticism of China's trade practices on Wednesday (Jan 18), telling senators he would seek new ways of combating them. During his confirmation hearing, Mr Ross called China the "most protectionist" country among large economies, with high-tariff and non-tariff barriers to imports. The 79-year-old billionaire, who made his fortune turning around troubled companies in steel, auto parts, textiles and other industries, vowed to level the playing field for US companies competing with Chinese imports and those trying to do business in China. Chinese officials, he said, "talk much more about free trade than they actually practise. We would like to level that playing field and bring the realities a bit closer to the rhetoric." Mr Ross said state-owned enterprises in China were a particular problem that needed to be dealt with, charging that up to one-third have never made a profit and this has fueled overcapacity that has led to dumping of like steel and aluminum. "They're being kept alive by state-owned banks. To me, that looks and feels and tastes a lot like artificial subsidies," he said, adding that the US Commerce Department will be "very scrupulous" in identifying unfair subsidies that require countervailing duties. Mr Ross did not specifically mention Mr Trump's threats to levy punitive tariffs on Chinese goods imported into America, but said countries that dump products below costs or fail to provide a fair trading field should be "severely punished". He said he would pay particular attention to sectors in need of anti-dumping tariffs, including steel and aluminum. The Commerce Department may initiate some anti-dumping and anti-subsidy cases on its own, rather than relying on private companies to build the cases, to shorten the processing time, Mr Ross said. He also said more wireless telecommunications spectrum, sales of which are managed by the Commerce Department, was needed by the private sector. He pledged to press government and military agencies that control it to release what they do not need. Mr Ross said that it was possible for the US economy to grow faster than it had done under the Obama administration. It could achieve about 3 percent growth by adopting Mr Trump's proposals to roll back some business regulations, expand domestic energy production, reduce US trade deficits and rebuild crumbling domestic infrastructure, Mr Ross observed. "I am not anti-trade. I am pro-trade," Mr Ross said. "But I am pro-sensible trade, not trade that is to the disadvantage of the American worker and to the American manufacturing community." Meanwhile, an influential Chinese state-run newspaper on Thursday (Jan 19) warned that US aircraft manufacturer Boeing and US agricultural imports could be targets for retaliation in any trade war ushered in by Mr Trump. In an editorial, the Global Times said that as America has the stronger economy, China may suffer more once a trade war starts, but China "will take the US on to the end". "There are few cases in modern history where only one party surrendered in a trade war; rather, the two parties ended up compromising with each other. How could Trump's team believe China would surrender without any countermeasures?" the Global Times said. "The arrogant Trump team has underestimated China's ability to retaliate. China is a major buyer of American cotton, wheat, beans and Boeing aircraft," the paper added in the editorial carried in its Chinese and English-language editions, without elaborating. Boeing's China office declined to comment. Boeing anticipates that China will need 6,800 new jetliners worth US$1 trillion (S$1.43 trillion) over the next 20 years. In October, Boeing and Chinese plane company Commercial Aircraft Corp of China signed an agreement to open a Boeing 737 completion facility in the Chinese coastal city of Zhoushan. The widely-read Global Times, run by the ruling Communist Party's official People's Daily, is known for its stridently nationalist tone, but its editorials cannot be viewed as representing government policies or official statements. In recent weeks, the Global Times and other state-run Chinese news outlets have issued several warnings of possible retaliation if the Trump administration carries out threats of tariffs or undermines Beijing's claims on self-ruled Taiwan. In November, the Global Times warned that China could switch large orders from Boeing to Europe, Apple phones would "essentially be crowded out", and US soybeans and corn banished from China if Mr Trump creates problems for China on trade. China is the world's top producer and consumer of cotton and top buyer of grains like soybeans to feed its vast livestock industry.

Photo: beashel/Flickr via Bangkok Post NACC member Witthaya Arkhompitak said that the anti-graft agency’s foreign affairs office was aware of the issue and it will work with the UK’s Serious Fraud Office (SFO) to gather all the information about the case before sending it to the NACC members for examination, Mr Witthaya said. The statute of limitations on the case has not yet expired, he insisted The indictment against Rolls Royce contains pages of company statements and records of bribes in Thailand. They began in 1991, when the military regime headed by Gen Suchinda Krapayoon was in power, and continued all the way until after the coup that ousted the Thaksin government in 2006, the documents allege. THAI president Charamporn Jotikasthira said yesterday (Jan 18) that the board decided to set up a committee to establish the facts. He said the initial information is enough for the panel to identify individuals who were involved in the acquisition process. The airline will cooperate closely with the firm in its inquiry which is expected to be wrapped up in 30 days, he said. Transport Minister Arkhom Termpittayapaisith told the airline to launch the investigation and clarify the questions as soon as possible. “THAI is taking the issue seriously and we’re committed to ensuring a transparent, corruption-free enterprise,” he said. The SFO revealed 12 counts of the firm’s conspiracy to corrupt or failure to prevent bribery in seven countries – Indonesia, Thailand, India, Russia, Nigeria, China and Malaysia. The case involved bribery in Thailand for the purchase of engines for THAI’s aircraft, but officials said that no Thai complaint was filed. According to the statement of facts prepared pursuant in the British court, the period of the scandal dates from 1991-2005 and involves a US$36.38 million (B1.28 billion) payment to “regional intermediaries” and some of the money was for individuals who were “agents of the State of Thailand and employees of THAI Airways”. The conspiracy to corrupt involved the purchase by THAI of Rolls-Royce’s Trent 800 (T800) engines, according to the document. The scandal occurred during three periods of time. Between June 1, 1991 and June 30, 1992 when THAI placed an order for six Boeing 777 aircraft which was later increased to eight. Rolls-Royce agreed to pay $18.8mn (B665mn) to the intermediaries during the period to “influence the purchasing decision”. The second period was between March 1, 1992 and March 31, 1997 when Rolls-Royce agreed to pay $10.38mn (B367mn) to the intermediaries and some of the money went to THAI employees, in particular, “those individuals who were expected to act in Rolls-Royce's favour” with respect to a second purchase by Thai of T800 engines. At the time, THAI made a second purchase of six Boeing 777 aircraft, according to the document. The third period was between April 1, 2004 and Feb 28, 2005. Rolls-Royce agreed to pay almost $7.2 million (B254mn) to the intermediaries. “A proportion of these monies was intended for individuals who were agents of the State of Thailand or THAI employees and those individuals were expected to act in Rolls-Royce’s favour with respect to a third purchase by THAI of T800 engines,” said the document. At the time, a third order of Boeing 777 aircraft by THAI had been under discussion as early as 1996. The order did not materialise until late 2004. Rolls-Royce again ensured that significant sums of money were available to its intermediaries for which it is inferred that this was to persuade THAI to purchase further aircraft with T800 engines. THAI had five presidents during these periods. They were ACM Weera Kitchathorn, Pol Lt Chatchai Boonya-anand, Thammanoon Wanglee, Pisith Kusalasaiyanond and Kanok Abhiradee. According to THAI sources, Rolls-Royce’s Trent engines have had a strong presence in THAI Airways’ fleet since the early 2000s with nearly all the newer generation of jetliners powered by the British-made engines. The THAI aircraft currently powered by Trent engines include 15 Airbus 330s, two Airbus 350 XWBs, 18 Boeing 777s in the versions of -200, -200ER and -300, six Boeing 787 Dreamliners, and six Airbus 380 double-decker superjumbos. A good part of the Trent engines was purchased by THAI after the scandal period (1991-2005). Hugh Vanijprabha, managing director of Rolls-Royce (Thailand) Ltd, said, “The past practices that have been uncovered do not reflect the matter in which Rolls-Royce does business today. “We now conduct ourselves in a fundamentally different way. “We have zero tolerance of business misconduct of any sort. We will come out of this episode as a more trusted, resilient and better managed business that ‘wins right’ every time. Our underlying technologies and skills are as strong as ever.” Read original story here.     Comment on this story * Please login to comment.

A Thai Airways investigation about Thai Airways bribes demanding/receiving is like a butcher checking his own meat.
I don't give a Baht for it.
 Surprised Wolf | 20 January 2017 - 10:17:10 THAI AIRWAYS had a culture of corruption. Even the hotels had to pay a kick back to get the passengers of Thai Airways. The manager or supervisor in charge would also demand money to send the passengers of a delayed flight to any of the hotels, even if that meant more inconvenience for the passenger. They used to have this throughout the organisation. Corruptionot, misbehavi9r and an attitude of "having the right to" is part of TG company culture and that is why they do not perform.

Four F-35Cs are scheduled to arrive at Naval Air Station Lemoore on Jan. 25 as part of a new Fleet Replacement Squadron for the West Coast. “The ‘Rough Raiders’ of VFA-125, which reactivated on Jan. 12, will be the Navy's west coast Fleet Replacement Squadron for the F-35C Lightning II, responsible for training the next generation of Naval Aviators on the aircraft,” reads a statement from Naval Air Forces. The Navy will hold a formal ceremony to mark the event. Dignitaries including Vice Adm. Mike Shoemaker, commander of Naval Air Forces will speak at the aircraft arrival ceremony. The F-35’s arrival at Lemoore marks the beginning of the Navy’s transition onto the new type, but that switch onto the new platform is not proceeding particularly smoothly. The Navy’s F-35C variant is supposed to enter operational service in 2019 if all goes well. But the carrier-variant has hit a snag with its nose gear—which oscillates during catapult launches when the jet is lightly loaded as Lee Hudson reports. The Navy is implementing some short and medium-term mitigation efforts for the problem, but in the longer term, the nose-gear will have to be redesigned to fix the issue. That adds to the cost and delays already incurred by the program. Meanwhile, though much of the Navy’s bureaucracy has been lukewarm toward the single-engine F-35C, chief of naval operations Adm. John Richardson acknowledged that the service needs the stealthy new aircraft. There is simply no alternative stealth aircraft that can be developed in the near-term that could perform the penetrating strike mission before an F/A-XX or Next Generation Air Dominance platform could be fielded in the mid-2030s. "We need the F-35s," Richardson said at a Defense One conference recently. "That is our 5th-gen capability which we need, supplemented by healthy cadre of advanced Super Hornets." With the proliferation of advanced Russian and Chinese air defenses such as the S-300V4, S-400 and the HQ-9, the Navy will need a stealth platform to penetrate those potent air defenses. The S-300V4 and S-400 are extremely capable weapons that have the potential to engage targets as far out as 250 miles when equipped with the appropriate missile. Thus, such missiles pose a deadly threat to conventional combat aircraft. However, analysts and even Pentagon officials have questioned the utility of the F-35C in the Western Pacific. China has developed a series of anti-access/area denial weapons such as the D-21D and DF-26 anti-ship ballistic missiles, a host of anti-ship cruise missiles and other systems that are specifically designed to keep the carrier at bay. If the carrier is forced to launch strikes from outside a 1000 nautical mile radius of the enemy shoreline, the utility of carrier-based strike fighters comes into question. Indeed, for the past ten years, Naval strategists in Washington have envisaged a long-range strike aircraft that would be able to launch and recover from outside the radius of those weapons, but the Navy has, thus far, in pursuing that option.

On Dec. 13, it achieved $160 and, along with the market, is currently consolidating its gains. The consolidation pattern suggests that another breakout for this, the world’s largest manufacturer of commercial jets, is likely. And, as noted in my Nov. 10 Trade of the Day, BA stock is also the second largest maker of military weapons. Despite a supposed “dispute” with the new administration over the manufacture of Air Force One, things are still looking good for BA. Standard & Poor’s has raised their EPS estimate to $9.56 in 2017, up from $7.42 in 2016, noting that over the next several years, commercial aircraft demand is strong, with 787 and 737 production ramps. Cash returns to investors should rise due to stock repurchases and dividends. S&P’s 12-month target for BA is $172 based on 18X their 2018 EPS. Boeing’s trend is decidedly bullish, with “ramp-ups” from the low last January at $105 to its current consolidation. The stock, as noted on the chart, is in a consolidation channel from $155 to $160. A break from the resistance line at $160 should result in a 20-point run to $180 spurred on by new commercial and defense orders as well as further clarification of returns from the F-35 program. Moreover, BA pays a dividend of $5.68 for a dividend yield of 3.6%, which should attract those seeking long-term dividends from an investment-grade equity.

X Close Regional Home > News > Regional < Back to SMG 45 Thursday, 19 January 2017 ‘MH370 search may resume in future’ MELBOURNE: The Australian go­­vernment said it was not ruling out a future underwater search for a missing Malaysia Airlines passenger jet as families of those on board criticised the decision to suspend the hunt after three fruitless years. The location of Flight MH370 has become one of the world’s greatest aviation mysteries since the plane, a Boeing 777, disappeared in 2014 en route to Beijing from the Malaysian capital of Kuala Lumpur with 239 people on board. “I don’t rule out a future underwater search by any stretch,” Australian Transport Minister Dar­ren Chester said here yesterday, a day after Australia, Malaysia and China officially called off the search in the southern Indian Ocean. The search cost around US$150mil (RM668.8mil), mostly paid by Malaysia, and has already been extended twice. But the three countries involved have been reluctant to keep looking without new evidence about the plane’s final resting place. A recommendation from investigators last month to look to the north of the 120,000sq km area that has been the focus of search efforts was rejected by Australia and Malaysia as too imprecise. Chester said cost had not been the determining factor to halt the search, but he said restarting it would require “credible new information which leads to a specific location”. Australian Prime Minister Mal­colm Turnbull yesterday expressed “deep regret” that the plane had not been found, but reaffirmed the agreement between Malaysia, Austra­lia and China to stop looking. Boeing did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Flight MH370 lost contact over the Gulf of Thailand in the early hours of March 8, 2014. Subsequent analysis of radar and satellite contacts suggested someone on board may have deliberately switched off the plane’s transponder before diverting it thousands of kilometres out over the Indian Ocean. Since the crash, there have been competing theories over whether the plane was hijacked and whe­ther it was under the control of any­one when it finally ran out of fuel. But quitting the underwater search drew a swift and angry reaction from relatives of those on board, who had called for the project to be expanded. In China, Jiang Hui, whose mo­­ther was also on board the flight, said he felt “disappointed, helpless and angry” because the search had been ended. There was also anger on social media at the news. “Didn’t they say they would never end the search? What the hell happened?” wrote one user on China’s Twitter-like Weibo service. The only confirmed traces of the plane have been three pieces of debris found washed up on the island country Mauritius, the French island Reunion and an island off Tanzania. — Reuters Tags / Keywords: australia Related Stories Horrified spectators watch as plane nosedives into river at Perth air show Thousands watch as plane plunges into Australian river Tension soars over Australia Day boycott East Timor, Australia set date for new sea border deal Actor shot dead during filming of music video in Brisbane bar You May Be Interested India marks Republic Day in grand way No happily ever after for village matchmakers New future forged in the kilns of China’s Forbidden City Bring cheer to the underprivileged this festive season Go purple this CNY if you want to get lucky in love Six simple steps to feng shui your home Others Also Read Ponkan oranges choice of the season Singing out strong for a night out Russian security service says hackers attacked major banks in 2016 advertisement Latest News Trump signs order to keep out some refugees, prioritise Syrian Christians Najib arrives at MCA Open House Liow: Year of the Rooster can inspire unity Trump will speak with Japan's Abe on Saturday - White House Fear in interrogation room, death in the street: Iraq roots out Islamic State Most Viewed in News Vehicles swept away by flood ‘We can get US visa-waiver’ ‘Lion dance here more vibrant than in China’ Double the number, double the happiness Drunken man seriously injured after mistaking firecracker for ciggie Temple enters book of records with giant artworks Do you . . . know that chickens are ruling the roost in 2017 DBKL officer among four charged over truck driver assault Cops chasing after driver who obstructed ambulance Four charged with rioting at condo Powered by advertisement advertisement site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Lifestyle Tech Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services Magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs Advertising View Our Rate Card Policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu StarProperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com Search The Star Online Connect with us Content Partner Our Radio Stations site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Tech Lifestyle Travel Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs advertising View Our Rate Card policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu starproperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com social media Facebook Twitter Copyright © 1995- Star Media Group Berhad (ROC 10894D)

Trump, who is sworn into office on Friday, has criticised China's trade practices and threatened to impose punitive tariffs on Chinese imports. Billionaire investor Wilbur Ross, Trump's choice for commerce secretary, voiced sharp criticism of China's trade practices on Wednesday, telling senators he would seek new ways of combating them. Chinese Commerce Ministry spokesman Sun Jiwen said the government was willing to work with the new U.S. administration to promote the healthy development of commercial ties. "I believe China and the United States can resolve any disputes through dialogue and negotiation and that the China-U.S. commercial relationship will not significantly stray from the path of mutual benefit," Sun told reporters. "Both sides benefit with cooperation, and both are hurt with conflict," he added. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said any disputes should be resolved via constructive talks, to avoid any miscalculations. "We look forward to working hard with the new U.S. government, adhering to no clashes and no confrontation," she told a separate briefing. But a high-powered economist and a widely-read state-run newspaper took a harsher line. Chen Wenling, chief economist at the China Centre for International Economic Exchanges, an influential think tank with close government ties, said China does not desire a trade war but it is certainly not afraid of one. "If you want a fight, then we will fight and we will fight to the end," Chen said. "But the U.S. will be the first to be injured and their injuries will be more severe," she said, adding that China could "definitely defeat the U.S." In an editorial, the Global Times said that as the United States has the stronger economy, China may suffer more once a trade war starts, but China "will take the U.S. on to the end". "There are few cases in modern history where only one party surrendered in a trade war; rather, the two parties ended up compromising with each other. How could Trump's team believe China would surrender without any countermeasures?" it said. "The arrogant Trump team has underestimated China's ability to retaliate. China is a major buyer of American cotton, wheat, beans and Boeing aircraft," the paper added in the editorial carried in its Chinese and English-language editions, without elaborating. Boeing Co's China office declined to comment. Boeing anticipates China will need 6,800 new jetliners worth $1 trillion over the next 20 years. In October, Boeing and Chinese planemaker Commercial Aircraft Corp of China Ltd (COMA) signed an agreement to open a Boeing 737 completion facility in the Chinese coastal city of Zhou. The Global Times, run by the ruling Communist Party's official People's Daily, is known for its stridently nationalist tone, but its editorials cannot be viewed as representing government policies or official statements. In recent weeks, the Global Times and other state-run Chinese news outlets have issued several warnings of possible retaliation if the Trump administration carries out threats of tariffs or undermines Beijing's claims on self-ruled Taiwan. In November, the Global Times warned that China could switch large orders from Boeing to Europe, Apple phones would "essentially be crowded out" and U.S. soybeans and corn banished from China if Trump creates problems for China on trade. China is the world's top producer and consumer of cotton and top buyer of grains such as soybeans to feed its vast livestock industry.

"I believe China and the United States can resolve any disputes through dialogue and negotiation and that the China-U.S. commercial relationship will not significantly stray from the path of mutual benefit," Sun told reporters. "Both sides benefit with cooperation, and both are hurt with conflict," he added. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said any disputes should be resolved via constructive talks, to avoid any miscalculations. "We look forward to working hard with the new U.S. government, adhering to no clashes and no confrontation," she told a separate briefing. But a high-powered economist and a widely-read state-run newspaper took a harsher line. Chen Wenling, chief economist at the China Centre for International Economic Exchanges, an influential think tank with close government ties, said China does not desire a trade war but it is certainly not afraid of one. "If you want a fight, then we will fight and we will fight to the end," Chen said. "But the U.S. will be the first to be injured and their injuries will be more severe," she said, adding that China could "definitely defeat the U.S." In an editorial, the Global Times said that as the United States has the stronger economy, China may suffer more once a trade war starts, but China "will take the U.S. on to the end". "There are few cases in modern history where only one party surrendered in a trade war; rather, the two parties ended up compromising with each other. How could Trump's team believe China would surrender without any countermeasures?" it said. "The arrogant Trump team has underestimated China's ability to retaliate. China is a major buyer of American cotton, wheat, beans and Boeing aircraft," the paper added in the editorial carried in its Chinese and English-language editions, without elaborating. Boeing Co's China office declined to comment. Boeing anticipates China will need 6,800 new jetliners worth $1 trillion over the next 20 years. In October, Boeing and Chinese planemaker Commercial Aircraft Corp of China Ltd (COMA) signed an agreement to open a Boeing 737 completion facility in the Chinese coastal city of Zhou. The Global Times, run by the ruling Communist Party's official People's Daily, is known for its stridently nationalist tone, but its editorials cannot be viewed as representing government policies or official statements. In recent weeks, the Global Times and other state-run Chinese news outlets have issued several warnings of possible retaliation if the Trump administration carries out threats of tariffs or undermines Beijing's claims on self-ruled Taiwan. In November, the Global Times warned that China could switch large orders from Boeing to Europe, Apple phones would "essentially be crowded out" and U.S. soybeans and corn banished from China if Trump creates problems for China on trade. China is the world's top producer and consumer of cotton and top buyer of grains such as soybeans to feed its vast livestock industry.

Trump, who is sworn into office on Friday, has criticised China's trade practices and threatened to impose punitive tariffs on Chinese imports.

Home Latest Popular Pakistan Today's Paper Opinion World Sport Business Magazines Culture Blogs Tech Multimedia Archive In Depth SEARCH Another bailout package for PIA allowed Khaleeq Kiani — Updated Jan 20, 2017 05:37pm WHATSAPP   20 Comments  Email Email Your Name: Recipient Email:  Print ISLAMABAD: The government on Wednesday allowed another bailout package for the troubled national airline and increased the quantity of wheat export to 1.3 million tonnes to reduce surpluses that may cause price crash. The decision was taken at a meeting of the Economic Coordination Committee of the cabinet presided over by Finance Minister Ishaq Dar. The ECC also approved payment of one-month salary to the employees of the Pakistan Steel Mills outstanding since October last year. According to an official statement, the meeting approved a request for increasing the government’s guarantee limit for the Pakistan International Airlines Corporation Limited (PIACL) by Rs10.5 billion to Rs161.5bn to address its immediate challenges. It also constituted a committee headed by Planning and Development Minister Ahsan Iqbal to prepare yet another business plan to improve the airline. According to informed sources, the airline’s management pleaded that its fiscal challenges had multiplied after a recent plane crash (PK-661), though it had been running with liquidity crisis for many years. Continuous money injections over the past three years, it said, had improved the number of PIA planes and efficiency, but revenue could not pick up due to a reverse challenge — surplus capacity and low yields. Urgent plane inspections after the recent crash not only further affected the operations but also the revenue flow, the management said, adding that non-payments to aircraft lessors, fuel suppliers and service at home and abroad had reached a stage where the airline might be forced to ground its fleet and cause international default such as to Saudi Arabia, Pakistan State Oil, Boeing, Air France, Bakri, Euro Control and spare parts and engineering service providers. Thus, it said, there was an urgent requirement of about Rs7bn to meet “overdue liabilities”. On top of that, the PIA reported another requirement of Rs25bn to finance or roll over various loans guaranteed by the government before June 30 this year. For this all to achieve, the PIA management sought support of the government to increase its guarantee limit to Rs161.5bn from Rs151bn. Wheat export The ECC approved a proposal of the Ministry of National Food Security and Research (NFSR) to increase total exportable wheat quantities to 1.3m tonnes from 900,000 tonnes. Therefore, it also approved extension of time period for export of surplus wheat and its products till March 15. Under the decision, the governments of Punjab and Sindh would be able to export additional quantities of 200,000 tonnes each to ease surplus wheat stocks, purportedly creating financial and storage constraints to the provincial governments that could lead to a price fall to the benefit of consumers but to the disadvantage of the growers. The government had in July last year allowed export of 900,000 tonnes of wheat at $120 per tonne subsidy from public funds with a deadline of Nov 30. The two provinces failed to meet the deadline which was extended till Dec 31 with a permission to also export wheat products like suji, maida, etc, on the same subsidy rate. On Wednesday, the ECC was informed that Punjab could export only 380,000 tonnes against a target of 600,000 tonnes and Sindh 240,000 tonnes against a target of 300,000 tonnes. The NFSR ministry said the two provinces had now sought permission for increased exports in view of substantial stocks lying with the public sector. It said the current wheat stocks stood at about 7.8m tonnes which was much higher than the strategic stock requirement of 3.5-4m tonnes and supported the two provincial governments’ request for increasing the export quantities with extension in the deadline. It was argued that additional exports were necessary to enable the provincial governments to free up storage space and liquidity to cater for 2016-17 wheat crop growing due in April-May. The ECC approved additional export of 400,000 tonnes of wheat and its products, with a permission to also clear backlog on the same condition i.e. subsidy of $120 per tonne. It decided to allow export of wheat and its products till March 15, with a directive to complete the process by May 31.

The Business Speaks event was sponsored by the South Carolina Chamber of Commerce. Officials from companies like Boeing, Michelin, Sonoco, SCE&G, Spirit Communications and the South Carolina Ports Authority received a State House tour and met with the leadership of the General Assembly, including powerful Senate President Pro Tempore Hugh Leatherman, R-Florence, and Speaker of the House Jay Lucas, R-Darlington. They later enjoyed a private reception at The Palmetto Club. Among the issues discussed were: ▪  Taking steps to improve the state’s workforce, such as eliminating state income tax rate for military retirees and initiating ex-offender workforce integration programs. ▪  Identifying sustainable, long-term funding to fix South Carolina’s roads and bridges. The options include removing the sales tax exemption on motor fuel and raising the sales tax exemption cap on vehicles. ▪  Simplifying the state’s business licensing process by initiating one form, one expiration date and the ability to file online through the Secretary of State. “We have to take steps to make our state's climate more business-friendly and competitive,” Chamber chief executive Ted Pitts said.

Since the real estate developer´s White House win in November, companies have lined up to announce new factories or jobs in the United States, including air conditioning manufacturer Carrier, Japan´s SoftBank, Ford, Fiat Chrysler and Amazon with a headline-grabbing promise to create 100,000 jobs. The latest additions to the growing list: Wal-Mart announced Tuesday it would invest $6.8 billion in the United States and create 10,000 jobs, General Motors announced $1 billion in new US investments and pledged to create 5,000 new jobs. Trump -- who since his election has wielded a mix of threats and incentives to push an America-first jobs agenda -- has been quick to take credit. "With all of the jobs I am bringing back into the US (even before taking office), with all of the new auto plants coming back into our country and with the massive cost reductions I have negotiated on military purchases and more, I believe the people are seeing ´big stuff, ´" he tweeted on Tuesday. Trump last month denounced the $4 billion price tag on the next presidential plane, which is currently under development, threatened to cancel the order unless the price came down. Dennis Muilenburg, CEO of the aviation giant Boeing, visited Trump Tower in Manhattan on Tuesday, telling reporters he and Trump were "on the same page" about the cost and value of the jet. The president-elect´s message appears to be resonating. - ´Phony election polls´ - Sixty-one percent of Americans believe it is likely the 45th president will be able to create good-paying jobs in economically challenged areas, according to a CNN/ORC poll released Tuesday. The same percentage expects Trump to do a good or excellent job in handling the economy, according to a Washington Post-ABC News poll released the same day. But this confidence in Trump´s ability to boost American job creation stands out as the exception, with polls suggesting an overall distrust of Barack Obama´s successor. Trump is half as popular as Obama was when he was preparing to take office in January 2009, according to the Washington Post-ABC News poll. He is less popular than any other incoming US president of the past four decades, going back to Jimmy Carter. The latest surveys confirm the findings of other recent polls. Trump slammed the findings, pointing out that a majority of surveys ahead of his November 8 electoral win predicted victory for his Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton. "The same people who did the phony election polls, and were so wrong, are now doing approval rating polls. They are rigged just like before," he said on Twitter. - Democrats boycott - The president-elect was to leave Trump Tower for a few hours Tuesday to visit Washington, where preparations for his inauguration are underway. On Sunday, organizers carried out a rehearsal of the ceremony and parade, with a military officer who is the same height as Trump standing in for the president-elect. Miles of barricades were going up, blocking off the central axis of the city running from the White House to the Capitol, where Trump will be sworn into the highest office of the land at noon on Friday. Hundreds of thousands of well-wishers and protesters were expected to take in the ceremony from the sprawling National Mall. Some 28,000 security forces will ensure the safety of the event, with some already on duty in the streets of Washington. One major security challenge is the hundreds of thousands of protesters expected to descend on the capital, for both the inauguration on Friday and a major protest march planned for Saturday. Protests during presidential inaugurations are not unusual, with George W. Bush targeted by anti-war demonstrators in 2005 after his re-election. But this year, more than 40 Democratic lawmakers have said they are boycotting the inauguration, the vast majority of them in support of Congressman John Lewis, a 76-year-old icon of the civil rights movement. The Georgia congressman Lewis made waves last week when he told an interviewer that he does not see Trump as a legitimate president, citing intelligence that Russia interfered in the November election. Trump lashed out on Twitter, criticizing Lewis´s district as crime-infested and saying the man who marched with Martin Luther King was "all talk talk talk -- no actions or results." 0 0 Trump to take office with dismal ratings -- except on jobs was posted in world of Geo TV - https://www.geo.tv on January 18, 2017 and was last updated on January 18, 2017.

Art was born in Grande Prairie, Alberta, on September 10, 1926, to Arthur and Mabel (Floen) Bryant, then raised in Peace River and Edmonton. He served in the U.S. Air Force during the U.S. occupation of Germany after World War II, then became a naturalized U.S. Citizen in 1956. He married Jeanne Dennett in 1956. The couple settled in Seattle where Art graduated with a B.S. in Physics from the University of Washington. They later raised their three children on Maury Island. Art worked for Boeing and McDonnell Douglas then in later years for Seattle City Light. He retired in 1991. His interests included lapidary work, mycology and brewing beer. His pilsner won best of show at the 2002 Wahkiakum County Fair. Art's passion was his garden, where he used organic methods and practiced seed selection. His vegetables and fruits were enjoyed by family and his numerous friends. He was preceded in death by his wife, Jeanne, his sister, Dorothy (Bryant) Mackie and brother Charles Bryant. He is survived by daughter Kathleen M. (Bryant) Morgain of Skamokawa, daughter Twyla G. Bryant of Ellsworth, Maine and son Arthur S. Bryant of Ellsworth, Maine.

The University of California was honored Tuesday as one of the world’s most innovative institutions. In the company of multinational titans ranging from Apple to Boeing, UC was the only university honored as a 2016 Top 100 Global Innovator by Clarivate Analytics, a data and analysis company that spun off from Thomson Reuters. The list was compiled by assessing the volume of patents and their quality, market reach and influence on other discoveries. UC made the list for the first time since its inception in 2011. In its report, Clarivate said UC had been particularly successful in recent years in seeing its inventions earn patents and in extending its collaborations and reach globally. “The University of California is the world’s leading public research university system. As a newly recognized Top 100 Global Innovator with more than 3,000 patented inventions [from] 2011-2015, this is testament to the power of innovation in translating research into developing practical solutions to existing problems,” Clarivate said in its report. The list was developed by analyzing four metrics related to patents: the volume of patents; the success rate of inventions that lead to patents; the volume of patents that are protected in multiple world markets; and how often a patent is cited by other companies and institutions in their own filings. UC stood out in 2016 for the increase in both the reach and success of its discoveries, and was particularly strong in pharmaceuticals, medical technologies and other health advances, followed by measurements, computers and transistors.

The Defence Ministry said the U.S.-funded Arrow 3 system, jointly developed by state-owned Israel Aerospace Industries and U.S. firm Boeing Co. , was handed over the Israeli Air Force.   The Arrow 3, together with the Arrow 2, which has been operational since 2000, would “significantly reduce the possibilities of ballistic missiles” hitting Israel, the ministry said in a statement. The Arrow 2 is designed to intercept projectiles high and low within the atmosphere. Arrow 3 missiles will fly into space, where their warheads detach to become “kamikaze” satellites that track and slam into their targets. Such high-altitude shoot-downs are meant to safely destroy incoming nuclear, biological or chemical missiles. Israel has frequently voiced concern about a ballistic missile threat posed by its arch-foe, Iran. The United States has its own system for intercepting ballistic missiles in space, Aegis. Arrow serves as the top tier of an integrated Israeli shield built up to withstand various potential missile or rocket salvoes. The bottom tier is the already-deployed short-range Iron Dome interceptor, which was used extensively with high success rates in a 2014 Gaza war against Hamas militants. Another Israeli system called David’s Sling is being developed to shoot down mid-range, lower-altitude missiles, such as those in the arsenal of Iranian-backed Hezbollah, a Lebanese group which last fought a war with Israel in 2006. https://www.yahoo.com/news/israel-deploys-star-wars-missile-killer-system-165038816–finance.html Share this: Print Email Share on Tumblr Tweet Pocket This entry was posted in News.

Cooper for Amateur Sleuths by Corky Siemaszko Share Share Tweet Share Comment Email Print advertisement Play Facebook Twitter Google Plus Embed D. B. Cooper search: Scientists say they have new evidence in 45-year-old case 2:30 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog <iframe src="http://www.nbcnews.com/widget/video-embed/856312387932" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe> A clip-on tie binds a group of amateur scientists to a new theory about the infamous D.B. Cooper hijacking case that has stymied investigators for 45 years. The group Citizens Sleuths believes the calculating desperado who took over a Boeing 727 passenger plane on Thanksgiving Eve 1971 may have been an engineer at a plant that supplied metal to the aerospace industry. Their evidence? Exotic metal particles discovered on the cheap tie they believe belonged to the mystery man. An artist made these sketches of the skyjkacker known as Dan Cooper from the recollections of the passengers and crew of an Northwest Airlines jet he hijacked between Portland and Seattle on Thanksgiving eve in 1971. AP "Only engineers and managers in fabrication plants wore ties to work," the group reported on its site. "Cooper's knowledge of the workings of the airplane, the use of the parachute, and his construction of a 'bomb' suggest he may have been an engineer." The new development in the case came six months after the FBI suspended its investigation of the Nov. 24, 1971 hijacking of a Portland, Oregon-to-Seattle flight by a neatly-dressed man who identified himself as Dan Cooper, and who threatened to blow up the plane with a briefcase bomb if a $200,000 ransom wasn't paid. The suspect later escaped with the dough by parachuting from the plane — and has not been seen since, although some of the money was found in 1980. In this undated file photo, a helicopter takes off from search headquarters to scour the area where hijacker Dan Cooper might have parachuted into in Woodland, Wash. AP With the cooperation of the local FBI, the Citizens Sleuths researchers found particles of cerium, strontium sulfide and pure titanium after analyzing the JC Penney tie with an electron microscope. "The titanium particles on the tie was the most dramatic finding in this research," the group reported. "Most other metals would have to be written off as contamination or too common to be of any use. The additional finding that the titanium was not alloyed, allowed further restrictions on where Cooper could have acquired these unusual flecks. Cooper worked at or had access to a plant that used titanium and this fact alone reduces the number of potential suspects from millions down to hundreds." What they haven't confirmed is whether the tie, which was found on seat 18E where the hijacker was sitting, actually belonged to him. "The position of the FBI is that 'we don't know if it's his tie'," the group said on its site. That may explain why the FBI is not rushing to reopen its investigation. "The FBI is still committed to justice for this criminal incident, but we are not actively investigating at this time and have not requested additional assistance from outside entities," FBI spokeswoman Ayn Dietrich-Williams said. Asked about the possibility that the hijacker could have ties to an aerospace industry contractor or even a Boeing employee, spokesman Tom Kim said, "We don't have anything to share."

Cotton last August accused the Obama administration of “acting like a drug cartel” by making a controversial $400 million cash payment to Iran.

From Wal-Mart to General Motors to Amazon, a growing number of the world’s largest companies appear to be trying to get in step with President-elect Donald Trump’s demand that employers hire and keep jobs at home. (AP Photo/Bebeto Matthews, File) WASHINGTON  — From Wal-Mart to General Motors to Amazon, a growing number of the world's largest companies appear to be trying to get in step with President-elect Donald Trump's demand that employers hire and keep jobs at home. Trump, in response, has taken to Twitter to signal his approval. "Thank you to General Motors and Walmart for starting the big jobs push back into the U.S.!" he tweeted Tuesday afternoon. Yet it's unclear just how many jobs are actually being saved or created as a result of Trump's push or whether his administration will hold companies accountable for their pledges. In a solid job market with just 4.7 percent unemployment, hundreds of thousands of U.S. jobs are added all the time for a broad range of reasons. Trump has boasted that he deserves the credit based on what chief executives have told him, despite evidence to the contrary provided by those same companies. "Ask top CEO's of those companies for real facts. Came back because of me!" the president-elect declared on Twitter on Wednesday. GM announced Tuesday that it was creating or keeping 7,000 jobs, while Wal-Mart said it planned to hire 10,000 and support an additional 24,000 construction jobs with store openings and expansions. Those announcements followed Amazon's commitment to add 100,000 workers through mid-2018 and a bold claim by the Chinese online retailer Alibaba that it would create 1 million U.S. jobs over the next five years. That extravagant pledge would make Alibaba alone responsible for over 10 percent of all jobs added each year — an unheard-of feat in the modern economy. Many economists say the hiring being celebrated by Trump reflects, more than anything, the health of the $18.7 trillion economy he is inheriting. "Between the election and today, unless you work on Capitol Hill in D.C., nothing fundamental has changed in the U.S. labor market," said Andrew Chamberlain, chief economist at the jobs site Glassdoor. To these economists, the latest high-profile hiring announcements suggest that companies are capitalizing on the politically charged climate. Trump has berated companies such as Nabisco for shuttering domestic plants in order to open factories in Mexico, while celebrating companies that publicly commit to hiring in the United States. What's more, nearly every major U.S. employer has tax and regulatory issues before the government. To that end, a sympathetic ear in the White House could be helpful. The heads of German chemical company Bayer and seed-and-herbicide-maker Monsanto met with Trump last week to pitch the benefits of a planned-for merger of the two companies that requires antitrust clearance. And Trump proudly tweeted reports Wednesday that Bayer would add U.S. jobs. By announcing new jobs, companies can use any existing hiring plans to ingratiate themselves with Trump by hitching their plans to his economic agenda, noted Patrick O'Keefe, director of economic research at the consultancy and accountant CohnReznick. "There is a degree of opportunism — in a positive way," O'Keefe said. GM plans to invest $1 billion in its U.S. factories and to create or keep 2,000 manufacturing jobs as well as 5,000 positions in auto financing and engineering — moves the company had said were being planned well before the election. Trump had drawn attention to GM this month by threatening on Twitter to tax the automaker for selling Mexican-built cars in the United States. That set up GM's jobs announcement as a coup for Trump, even though the investment was already in the works. A GM spokesman said it was "good timing for us to share what we are doing." Wal-Mart's hiring similarly seems somewhat independent of Trump. The jobs stem largely from plans to open and remodel stores— work that would not be outsourced overseas. Wal-Mart is the nation's largest private employer, with 1.5 million workers in the United States, and its hiring rate this year will be similar to prior years, said Lorenzo Lopez, a company spokesman. These announcements follow hiring plans announced by Ford and Fiat Chrysler, among others. The auto executives were willing to let Trump promote their hiring plans, even though their decisions involved other market forces, including increased demand for SUVs as gasoline prices have dropped. Hyundai said Tuesday that it plans to invest $3.1 billion by 2021 on research and development at its factories in Alabama and Georgia. Chung Jin Haeng, chief executive of the South Korean automaker, said the decision had little to do with Trump. "The U.S. market is strategically important," he said. At the same time, Trump has also talked with companies about cutting their costs — a move that often involves slashing jobs. He met Tuesday, for example, with the CEO of Boeing, a company he had criticized in December over Twitter for the "out of control" price of two new planes for the Air Force One fleet. CEO Dennis Muilenburg said he chatted with Trump about how to lower the costs for the presidential planes as well as fighter aircraft. "I think Mr. Trump is doing a great job with engaging the business," Muilenburg said afterward. "We're all on the same page here." Not all the job announcements will necessarily come to fruition. Alibaba has said it expects to add a million U.S. companies to its online retail platform in the next five years. It asserted that sales to Chinese consumers would lead each of those companies to add, on average, one job each. This would translate into an astounding 250,000 a jobs a year in an economy in which every employer, combined, added 2.2 million jobs in 2016. "It's not rocket-science math," said company spokesman Brion Tingler, who nevertheless cautioned that the 1 million jobs being publicized were an "aspiration." Other than his social media megaphone, Trump doesn't appear to have the means to hold companies accountable for their jobs pledges. His transition team didn't respond to questions about how it planned to ensure that CEOs' promises to create U.S. jobs were fulfilled. __ AP Business Writers Tom Krisher in Detroit, Anne D'Innocenzio in New York and Youkyung Lee in Seoul contributed to this report.

Count the Ways Trump will expand his power over the purse to punish his enemies, the author writes. By Neil H. Buchanan On 1/18/17 at 4:51 PM Close Ex Apprentice candidate Summer Zervos sues Donald Trump for defamation This article first appeared on the Verdict site. As the presidential transition period ends, there are still a vast number of unanswered questions about Donald Trump’s willingness to extend and abuse the powers of the presidency. How far is he willing to go, and will anyone be able to stop him—or even try?

For a variety of political reasons, it is possible that a majority of either house of Congress could block an increase in the debt ceiling. If that happens, Trump could—and as I argued, should—announce that the debt ceiling is an unconstitutional statute and thus that he has no choice but to ignore it. The reasons that this would not actually be an abuse of presidential power are important, and I will describe them in a moment. After doing so, however, I will explore how Trump could seize upon—or even create—a debt ceiling crisis as a way to enhance his powers. For the purposes of last week’s column, it was enough simply to say that the debt ceiling law is constitutional, without explaining why. Here, however, the “why” becomes the whole story, because the explanation has everything to do with the principle of presidential modesty. And modesty is a quality that we are unlikely to see in the new administration. In the series of articles that Michael Dorf and I wrote about the debt ceiling over the last several years, we investigated the impossible situation that a debt-ceiling crisis would create for the president. In what we called a trilemma, the president would be constitutionally obligated to do three logically inconsistent things: collect a certain amount of money (but no more) in taxes, spend a larger amount of money than that to pay the government’s legally binding obligations, but not borrow money in order to make up the difference. One possible answer to that conundrum would be for the president simply to say, “OK, I get to choose which law or laws not to execute, because Congress gave me no other option.” We rejected that conclusion because of the Framers’ clear intent that the Constitution’s separation of powers should be preserved. Related: Neil Buchanan : Will divided Republicans try to halt Trump? Even though anything the president would do in the face of a trilemma would violate the Constitution, therefore, he still would have the duty to minimize the constitutional damage. And that means that he would have to decide which of the three sets of laws—spending, taxing and borrowing—were least important in terms of preserving the constitutional separation of powers. Would we want a president to be able to say, “Hey, I need more money to pay the bills, but I can’t borrow it, so I’m going to raise taxes on my own?” Everyone agrees that that would be politically explosive. More to the point, however, it would be constitutionally disastrous, because it would see the president making the kinds of decisions that the legislature is supposed to make—picking winners and losers (who pays more taxes, who pays less) and balancing interests in the way that a representative body is designed to do. A new Madame Tussauds wax figure of Donald J. Trump in Washington, D.C., January 18. Neil Buchanan writes that Trump would jump on any possibility to expand his power over the purse, in order to give himself the power to punish his enemies. Larry French/Getty Although everyone agrees that unilateral tax increases by a president would be a nightmare, however, there was a surprising consensus among Washington insiders in both parties that a president facing a trilemma would be required to stop paying the government’s bills. That solution, however, would have the president again acting like a super-legislature, overriding Congress’s decisions regarding the power of the purse. Even if the president chose a seemingly neutral approach, such as stiffing everyone who is owed money by the same percentage, that would still be a legislative-like decision. After all, Congress generally does not cut every program by the same percentage when it decides to cut spending. That means that a presidential decision to set aside the debt ceiling would be the sole remaining choice—the least unconstitutional option. If the president borrowed beyond the debt ceiling, but Congress really and truly wanted debt to be below a certain level, it would be possible to adjust spending and taxes in the next budget to put things back where Congress wanted them to be. Notice, however, just how restrained the president would have to be in this situation. He would not be announcing that he is allowed to borrow as much as he wants, or saying that he can use the newly borrowed funds to finance his own pet projects. No, the president would still be required to spend exactly as much as Congress had ordered him to spend, neither more nor less. And he would also still be required to collect taxes as required by law, neither more nor less. His unconstitutional borrowing would be limited to making up the difference. This is why I wrote in my column last week that I could, under appropriate circumstances, agree with Trump even if he seemed to be doing something extreme. It would not, in fact, be an extreme action for a president to preserve Congress’s spending and taxing priorities by borrowing the money necessary to do so. The More Likely Path to an Abuse of Power by Trump In 2012, during one of the several depressing episodes of debt ceiling brinksmanship by House Republicans, I wrote, “Why Do Republicans Want to Give Obama Dictatorial Powers?” That provocative title was designed to expose the logical disconnect between what the Republicans claimed was their goal and what they were actually doing. After all, if the Republicans had not finally blinked, and thus if President Obama had been faced with a trilemma, Republican leaders claimed that he would be forced to “cut spending.” I use scare quotes here because what they would actually have forced him to do is to refuse to pay bills that Congress had already incurred in earlier spending bills. Even so, the Republicans insistently claimed that they were trying to get Obama to reduce spending. How would he have done so? For precisely the reasons that I described above, President Obama would have been forced to redo Congress’s job in setting spending priorities. And there is no reason to think that the Republicans would have been happy with Obama’s choices. In fact, we know for sure that they would have been unhappy even with the supposedly neutral policy that I described above, with all programs being cut by the same percentage. After all, when Congress itself did that (under what is now called “the sequester”), Republicans spent the next several years frantically trying to undo many of the automatic cuts to their favored programs (especially spending on military hardware). And any other prioritization by President Obama would have been quite rightly seen as reflecting the president’s choices, unconstrained by law (because Congress wrote no law to cover that situation). This means that Republicans, in saying that they refused to increase the debt ceiling because they wanted to force the president to reduce spending, would have given Barack Obama a ticket to pick winners and losers and to undo Republicans’ legislative priorities. In other words, they would have essentially begged him to act like a tyrant, and then they would have screamed bloody murder when he did so. And Trump? He has shown that he does not need an excuse to abuse or ignore laws and constitutional norms. Expecting him to choose the modest path of the least unconstitutional option would be foolish. Give him an excuse like this, and he would be sure to run with it. Therefore, when I wrote last week that I might agree with Trump during a debt ceiling crisis, that was not a prediction. My prediction is that, should Congress ever confront him with a trilemma, Trump would do the worst possible thing, which in this case is exactly what the Republicans were trying to get Obama to do for the last six years. Trump would refuse to pay money owed for programs that he disliked, for whatever reasons came into his head. Can Trump Contrive a Debt Ceiling Crisis? Perhaps, however, Trump does not need to wait around for Congress to give him the excuse to abuse his control over the Treasury. After all, a key element of the Buchanan-Dorf analysis was inspired by the nation’s unfortunate experience under Richard Nixon, the president whose abuses of power Trump might most envy and even try to outdo. During his abbreviated presidency, Nixon claimed that he could refuse to spend money even after Congress had appropriated it for specific purposes. The case did not make it to the Supreme Court before Nixon’s resignation, but Congress responded with the Impoundment Control Act, which required the president to spend exactly as much (no more nor less) as Congress had specified in its duly enacted laws. Years later, however, a different Congress actually tried to give away its own authority over spending by giving the president a “line-item veto,” which allowed the president to cancel spending items even after Congress had included them in appropriations laws. The Supreme Court quickly announced that this was prohibited by the Constitution, precisely because it would have involved having the executive take over legislative responsibilities. It did not matter that Congress wanted to divest itself of those powers, the court said. Legislators are the ones who should legislate, not executives. But these historical examples point to a way in which Trump could concoct an unconstitutional power grab. He is hardly known for subtlety, and admittedly this is a subtle strategy. Even so, he certainly has people working for him who are eagerly looking for every possible way to expand his powers. Specifically, Trump could refuse to sign a debt ceiling increase bill. That is, he could put himself into a trilemma on purpose, at which point he would say that he had no choice but to stiff people and companies to whom the government currently owes money. Certainly, Trump has already shown that he is willing to target specific people and companies for punishment. Were he capable of embarrassment, he would have been embarrassed by his tweet demanding cancellation of Boeing’s Air Force One project. The amused response by people who actually know how the law works was that he could not do so, even after he became president. This suggests that Trump would jump on any possibility to expand his power over the purse, in order to give himself the power to punish his enemies. Trump could easily demagogue the debt ceiling, in exactly the way that Republicans have been doing for years. The tweet writes itself: “Pathetic Congress tries to borrow even more trillions. Outrage. Veto!” An even more intriguing possibility is that Trump could try to veto a debt ceiling increase that had been included in another bill. After all, as I noted again in my column last week, the best way to handle the unconstitutionality of the debt ceiling—short of actually repealing it—would be to have Congress return to its practice under former Democratic Speaker Richard Gephardt, whose rule required that every spending bill include the necessary change in the debt ceiling that its total spending implied. What if Congress came to its senses and followed that path, sending Trump a new spending bill that properly avoided confronting the president with a trilemma? Would he threaten to veto the whole bill, causing a government shutdown unless it took out the debt ceiling increase? Pointing out the illogic of that strategy would surely have no impact. An even more extreme possibility would be for Trump to try to line-item veto the debt-ceiling increase, a deliciously paradoxical move that would give himself the power to veto sub-parts of bills by vetoing a sub-part of a bill. Why not? After all, maybe his allies on the Supreme Court will decide that he is allowed to do so. And if they do not, how many troops does the Supreme Court have? The Timeless Need for Constitutional Limits on Power As technical as the debt-ceiling debate can become, it is an excellent illustration of one of the most important questions to ask when thinking about the meaning of the Constitution: What would you want the rules to be when the worst possible person is in power? An essential reason even to have a constitution, after all, is to prevent the passions of a majority (or, in this case, a minority) of citizens from obliterating the rule of law. Republicans constantly complained about Obama’s supposed executive overreach, while Democrats wondered whether some of their pushing of the envelope might come back to bite them under a President Jeb Bush or (gasp!) Ted Cruz. Keeping the structure of law intact is essential, even as those in power test its limits. Trump is in an entirely different category. If Democrats wondered just how far Marco Rubio or John Kasich might push the limits, their heads are now spinning at the thought of what Trump might try to get away with. And because Republicans are showing no spine whatsoever, even in the face of Trump’s historic levels of unpopularity, we might soon learn to our dismay how far Trump will go. Manipulating the debt ceiling is not the sexiest way to abuse power, but it is a potent one. We should not expect Trump’s people to pass up any opportunity to inflict constitutional damage. Neil H.

Jonathan Ernst, Reuters WASHINGTON - With his carrot-and-stick manhandling of the US business community, President-elect Donald Trump has major companies falling over themselves to offer goodwill gestures and promises to create US jobs. This aggressive strategy -- in which Trump has publicly threatened major corporations over the use of foreign labor -- has sent ripples through a country that reveres free enterprise and is not accustomed to seeing the nation's chief executive go head to head with individual businesses.  But the tactic is creating the appearance of success.  Automaker General Motors and the retail giant Wal-Mart Stores on Tuesday joined the growing list of companies that have promised to ramp investment and employment in the United States since Trump began his post-election campaign against off-shoring US jobs. Trump has been quick to take credit for any job creation and new investments. BORDER TAX When NBC on Wednesday reported that many of the company announcements were "old news" given a fresh coat of paint, Trump responded with an angry tweet, calling it "FAKE NEWS!" Some firms may indeed have recycled investment plans long since announced or in the works, or emphasized job creation already scheduled. But all were acting under pressure from a president-elect who has used his Twitter account to threaten companies with a border tax and other punishments, frequently causing their share prices tumble as a result. "Car companies and others, if they want to do business in our country, have to start making things here again. WIN!" Trump said Sunday on Twitter. Under the Trump spotlight, Ford this month ended plans to build a $1.6 billion plant in Mexico and instead invest $700 million in the United States, while Fiat Chrysler repatriated production of one model and announced the creation of 2,000 jobs. Others in the auto sector have followed, including Toyota and GM, but companies in the tech sector, such as Sprint and Amazon, also have joined in. Trump has thanked some of his fellow business executives while also congratulating himself: "With all of the jobs I am bringing back into the US ... I believe the people are seeing 'big stuff,'" he tweeted Tuesday. For companies, the upshot is above all symbolic: avoiding bad press, burnishing patriotic credentials and ingratiating themselves with the new administration. The trend started in December with Carrier, an Indiana manufacturer of air conditioners and home furnaces which came out ahead in the bargain with Trump, getting tax state breaks in return for keeping a few hundred jobs in the United States. Without unveiling new investments, other captains of industry have joined in the theater at Trump Tower in New York, the president-elect's headquarters, hoping to put out fires with the future inhabitant of the White House. After his company was called out for the high cost of the future presidential plane, the head of aircraft giant Boeing reported to New York in an apparent show of contrition. "We're on the same page to provide the best capability for the lowest cost," CEO Dennis Muilenburg told reporters. Others merely popped in to say hello, including Bernard Arnault, head of the French luxury group LVMH, who did not rule out expanding operations in the United States. 'THE BOTTOM LINE' Before his shock November 8 victory, the real estate magnate was not the business world's preferred candidate.  While Wall Street banked on a victory by Democrat Hillary Clinton, most players in Silicon Valley were resolved to oppose Trump, with the Amazon founder Jeff Bezos even offering to rocket him into outer space, using the Twitter hashtag "#sendDonaldtospace."  After Trump's victory, the business world seems to have seen the light. "Before there was any chance that he would be elected, no one paid much attention to his program, which is what companies want: a lot of deregulation and tax cuts," said Aparna Mathur, a scholar at the conservative-leaning American Enterprise Institute in Washington. Having both houses of Congress and the White House in the hands of a single party holds out the prospect of ending years of gridlock in Washington. One key point in Trump's agenda still could undermine his relations with the business sector: retaliatory import duties on goods from Mexico and China, which could end up being costly. "The bottom line is that if we are going to 'Hire American,' we are going to have to 'Sell American' -- sell our goods and services to the 95 percent of the world's customers who don't live in the United States," warned Thomas Donahue, head of the powerful US Chamber of Commerce. © 1994-2017 Agence France-Presse Share Save Facebook Share on Twitter GPlus LinkedIn Pinterest Read More:  US   US economy   Donald Trump   /overseas/11/11/16/tycoon-as-president-donald-trumps-conflicts-of-interest /overseas/11/18/16/american-muslims-and-donald-trumps-victory /life/11/23/16/pinay-beauty-queen-badly-wants-to-meet-donald-trump /video/overseas/11/25/16/what-are-the-2-sides-of-donald-trump /video/life/01/05/17/balikan-donald-trump-napahanga-sa-ganda-ng-pinay-beauty-queens LATEST NEWS MOST READ Steve Harvey arrives in PH to host Miss Universe January 28, 2017 PH Coast Guard, naglinis sa Manila Bay January 28, 2017 Trump will speak with Japan's Abe on Saturday- White House January 28, 2017 After trading barbs, Bulls clear the air January 28, 2017 FBI request for Twitter account data may have overstepped legal guidelines January 28, 2017 N.

(Justin Lane / EPA) Katherine SkibaContact ReporterChicago Tribune Privacy Policy Despite the boycott of Donald Trump's inauguration by some congressional Democrats, Illinois will be well-represented at the event, as House members who are attending report strong demand for tickets to Friday's swearing-in ceremony. By mid-January, Republican Rep. Peter Roskam of Wheaton had received nearly 700 requests for the 198 tickets his congressional office was given, spokesman David Pasch said. "We've been able to scrounge up more than 100 additional tickets from other offices," Pasch said Wednesday, meaning about 300 people will be attending through Roskam's office alone. Democratic Rep. Brad Schneider of Deerfield, who unlike some in his party plans to attend the ceremony, gave out about 150 of his tickets and was holding on to the rest for "any last-minute requests, which are still coming in," spokesman Steven Kirsch said. Among the many young people expected at the nation's 58th presidential inauguration are students from Naperville Central High School, Wheaton North High School, Oswego East High School and J. Sterling Morton High School West in Berwyn, congressional aides said. The main event noon Friday is when the Republican from New York takes the oath and gives an inaugural address. The capital, already decked out in red, white and blue bunting by midweek, is bracing for crowds, street and subway station closures, ironclad security protocols and, on Friday, the prospect of rain. More than 60 Democratic lawmakers now skipping Trump's inauguration Elise Viebeck, Jenna Portnoy A growing group of Democratic lawmakers will boycott President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration Friday to protest what they described as his alarming and divisive policies, foreign interference in his election and his criticism of civil rights icon John Lewis, a congressman from Georgia.

The festivities for some Illinois visitors will begin Thursday night at the "Inaugural Heartland Ball," put on by the Illinois State Society of Washington, D.C., at the Marriott Marquis hotel. The black-tie gala is expected to draw about 1,300 to 1,500 guests, Terry Campo, society president, said Wednesday. He is a lawyer, lobbyist and political consultant from Springfield and often works in Washington. More than a dozen members of Congress from Illinois are expected at the ball, where ambassadors from countries including the United Kingdom, Italy, Austria, Luxembourg, Sri Lanka, Jamaica and Barbados are also expected, organizers said. Democratic Sen. Tammy Duckworth and the man she ousted in last November's election, Republican Mark Kirk, are also among expected guests.

(Justin Jouvenal) Guests will be entertained by karaoke and dance bands and Chicago foods including hot dogs, pizza and beef sandwiches, said Stuart Piper, an Illinois native who is helping to host the affair. Plans call for a room with a state fair theme and others styled as a supper club, a sports bar and a downstate diner, he said. A replica of the Marshall Field's building clock will be on display for a nostalgic touch. Piper is a former executive director of the Illinois Republican Party who is now a real estate salesman in Virginia. Campo, another Republican, said the gala would have gone on irrespective of who won the election. He said it's about the peacefully transfer of power. "That's what we're celebrating, not any particular winner." Boeing Co., based in Chicago, gave $1 million to President Barack Obama's inaugural in 2013 and reportedly has pledged the same amount to Trump's inauguration. The aerospace giant "has a long history of helping defray the costs associated with presidential inaugurations," company spokesman Chaz Bickers said. The firm committed to the gift before Trump last month attacked it on Twitter over the costs for construction of a new Air Force One, Bickers said. Democratic Sens. Dick Durbin and Duckworth will attend the swearing-in, along with seven House Republicans and at least four House Democrats. Five Illinois House Democrats will not attend; two were undecided. The Tiger Marching Band from Olivet Nazarene University, a Christian school in Bourbonnais, will perform in the inaugural parade. Friday night, there are three official inaugural balls. And Saturday, thousands will gather for the Women's March on Washington, an anti-Trump protest being replicated in Chicago and other cities. Cook County Commissioner Bridget Gainer said Wednesday she is joining her 72-year-old mother, her four sisters, her 13-year-old daughter and two nieces at the protest in Washington. Gainer, a Hillary Clinton supporter from Chicago's Lakeview neighborhood, said they are turning out to send a message to the new administration: Respect for women, and a concern for domestic violence, matter. "We're here, we're not going anywhere and we're going to continue to fight for the things that are important to us," she said. Democratic Reps. Luis Gutierrez of Chicago and Jan Schakowsky of Evanston plan to march and she said she will be accompanied by "many busloads of constituents."

REUTERS/Mike SegarMore WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President-elect Donald Trump will name former Georgia Governor Sonny Perdue as his nominee for secretary of agriculture on Thursday, a senior transition official said on Wednesday. Perdue, 70, served on Trump's agricultural advisory committee during his presidential campaign. His nomination, which must be confirmed by the Republican-led Senate, will complete Trump's proposed cabinet just before he is sworn in as president on Friday. By nominating a former governor from a Southern state, Trump eschewed candidates from major Farm Belt states in the Midwest that produce the bulk of crops such as corn, soybeans and wheat which dominate agriculture exports. Georgia is a key producer of crops such as cotton and peanuts. While Georgia governor, Perdue had to handle a severe drought in 2007, during which he took steps to cut water usage and at one point led a service outside the state capitol to pray for rain. Perdue, a Republican, was elected twice as governor, serving from 2003 to 2011. Before that, he was in the state senate representing a rural swath of the state about 100 miles (160 km) south of Atlanta. He switched political parties from Democratic to Republican in 1998 amid redistricting in the state and shifting demographics. Trump received strong support from the agricultural community as the farm economy slumped amid falling prices for key commodities. Ron Moore, president of the American Soybean Association (ASA), said he thought Perdue would support agriculture exports. "I think he will be very much in favor of trade," Moore said in a telephone interview. The ASA, with 15 other farm groups, this month urged the incoming administration to "protect and enhance" agricultural trade and its impact on the rural economy. Trade, a signature issue during the campaign in which Trump accused China of unfair practices, is critical for the farm economy. U.S. farm and food exports to China were more than $20.2 billion in 2015. Prices for soybeans rose 16.2 percent during 2016 on strong demand from China, which buys nearly 30 percent of the U.S. crop. Soybean exports helped boost U.S. gross domestic product in the third quarter. Some farmers are concerned that Trump's criticism of China could lead to deteriorating trade relations and put exports at risk. An influential Chinese state-run newspaper warned this week that U.S. agricultural imports and U.S. aircraft manufacturer Boeing Co could be targets for retaliation in any trade war ushered in by Trump. Zippy Duvall, president of the American Farm Bureau, praised Perdue as a strong voice. But environmental groups opposed the nominee. "Farmers need a champion in the USDA who will fight for conservation programs to help farmers be more resilient in the face of extreme weather, not pray for rain," Kari Hamerschlag, deputy director of food and technology at Friends of the Earth, said in a statement. After finishing his second term as governor, Perdue founded Perdue Partners, a global trading firm that consults and provides services for companies looking to export products. His cousin David Perdue is serving his first term representing Georgia in the U.S. Senate. The nominee is not related to chicken magnate Frank Perdue.

Credit: Ken Kremer/kenkremer.com CAPE CANAVERAL AIR FORCE STATION, FL – A U.S. Air Force satellite that will provide vital early warnings on incoming enemy missiles that are critical to the defense of our homeland is set for a spectacular nighttime blastoff on Thursday Jan. 19 from the Florida Space Coast. Update: Launch reset to Jan 20 at 7:42 pm EST The Atlas V rocket carrying the $1.2 Billion SBIRS GEO Flight 3 infrared imaging satellite counts as the first launch of 2017 by rocket builder United Launch Alliance (ULA) as well as the years first liftoff from Cape Canaveral. The ULA Atlas V rocket is set for liftoff on Thursday, Jan. 19 from Space Launch Complex-41 at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida. The Space Based Infrared System (SBIRS) satellite will be launched to geosynchronous transfer orbit. It is the third satellite in this series of infrared surveillance satellites that will provide rapid and accurate warning of attacking enemy strategic missiles via infrared signatures – as well as critical targeting data to US missile defense systems to enable swiftly responding launches that will hopefully destroy the attackers in the battle space arena before impacting US cities, infrastructure and military installations. USAF SBIRS GEO 3 missile warning satellite under construction by prime contractor Lockheed Martin. Credit: Lockheed Martin The 20 story tall rocket and payload were rolled out vertically this morning some 1800 feet (600 m) from the Vertical Integration Facility (VIF) processing hangar to pad 41. With the unpredictable North Korean dictator Kim John Un threatening to launch an upgraded long range intercontinental ballistic missile this year that could potentially strike the United States west coast, SBIRS GEO 3 is more important than ever for our national defense. The launch window opens at 7:46 p.m. EST (0046 GMT). The launch window extends for 40 minutes from 7:46-8:26 p.m. EST. Spectators are flocking into Space Coast area hotels for the super convenient dinnertime blastoff. And they will have a blast ! – if all goes well. You can watch the Atlas launch live via a ULA webcast. The live launch broadcast will begin about 20 minutes before the planned liftoff at 7:26 p.m. EST here: http://www.ulalaunch.com/webcast.aspx www.youtube.com/unitedlaunchalliance and www.ulalaunch.com The current launch weather forecast for Thursday, Jan. 18, calls for an 80 percent chance of acceptable weather conditions at launch time. The primary concern is for cumulus clouds. The backup launch opportunity is on Friday. In case of a scrub for any reason, technical or weather, the chances for a favorable launch drop slightly to 70% GO.

SBIRS GEO 3 will launch southeast at an inclination of 23.29 degrees. It separate from the 2nd stage 43 minutes after liftoff. ULA has enjoyed a 100% success rate for this 69th Atlas V launch stretching back to the company’s founding back in 2006. ULA is a joint venture of Boeing and Lockheed Martin with 116 successful launches under its belt.

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it President-elect Donald Trump speaks during a “USA Thank You Tour 2016” event in Des Moines in December. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post) By Philip Rucker By Philip Rucker January 18 Follow @PhilipRucker When President-elect Donald Trump successfully demanded that Carrier keep some manufacturing jobs from going to Mexico, he was criticized at first for bullying the heating and cooling giant and for violating the Republican Party’s free-market capitalist ethos. In the eight weeks since, however, the atmosphere has changed dramatically. Almost daily, in Twitter missives as well as private meetings, Trump continues to hector businesses to make investments in the United States. And he is receiving credit for announcements from some of the world’s biggest corporations — Bayer AG, General Motors and Walmart just this week — that they are keeping or adding U.S. jobs, even if their plans were developed long before his agitations. Trump is trying to put the bully back into the bully pulpit, modeling his governing style after Theodore Roosevelt, the president whose attacks on industry barons inspired the term. The Trump strategy is to change the behavior of corporations — not to mention the intelligence community and other creatures of Washington — through force of intimidation. His advisers talk about the president-elect’s provocations, such as threatening a 35 percent tax on imports, not as policy destinations necessarily, but as boundaries designed to frame the discussion and instill fear in corporate boardrooms. “Trump understands that if you change the culture, the behavior follows,” said former House speaker Newt Gingrich, a Trump ally and informal adviser. “He wants to create a Trumpian environment so that boards go into a meeting saying, ‘No, we’re not leaving the U.S.’ ” (Daron Taylor/The Washington Post) Trump’s demands on the business community are among the most notable actions of the pre-inaugural period. The list of major companies announcing U.S. jobs in recent weeks has ranged from Hyundai Motor to Amazon, and in each case Trump and his aides have trumpeted their announcements and claimed credit. [The real reason Ford abandoned its plant in Mexico has little to do with Trump] It is unclear, however, how much the president-elect’s threats influenced their actual business plans, which are months or years in the making and determined by an array of factors. The unemployment rate has remained at 5 percent or lower for more than a year, and many companies have been expanding their operations. “The word is now out that when you want to move your plant to Mexico or some other place, and you want to fire all of your workers from Michigan and Ohio and all these places that I won, for good reason — not going to happen that way anymore,” Trump said at his first post-election news conference last week. Corporate America has quickly adapted to Trump’s new posture. Fear permeates “C-suites,” where executives are trying to come up with ways to please the incoming president and avoid his wrath, according to people whose work places them in the nexus of business and politics. William M. Daley, a financier and business executive who has served as White House chief of staff under President Obama and as secretary of commerce under former president Bill Clinton, said, “CEOs want to play nice because they’re afraid of getting caught in a Twitter storm.” “They would never call his bluff,” Daley said. “They’re scared to death. They’ll run to the Congress and say, ‘Oh, save us from this.’ It’s a good M.O., because he knows these guys will roll over the minute he puts his sights on them.” Left, President-elect Donald Trump speaks during a news conference at Trump Tower in New York on Jan. 11. Right, with characteristic fervor, Theodore Roosevelt is shown speaking when he stumped the country for William McKinley during the presidential campaign of 1900. Roosevelt was McKinley’s running mate on the Republican ticket. (Jabin Botsford/Brown Brothers/The Washington Post; Associated Press) Scott Reed, chief strategist for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said companies are motivated in part by what they see as a “positive business environment” under the Trump administration, which has vowed to overhaul the tax code as well as loosen environmental, financial and other regulations. “The business community is practical and pragmatic, and looking forward to engaging with the new administration in a constructive manner,” Reed said. “This was a change election, and we like that the country is now upbeat and optimistic about real economic growth in the 3 percent to 4 percent range.” [How a week of Trump tweets stoked anxiety, moved markets and altered plans] Trump is a modern-day Roosevelt, who from the White House in the 1900s demonized banks, railroads and other businesses he viewed as insufficiently nationalist. “Roosevelt’s bully pulpit was very ardently about going after companies and wealthy people that weren’t putting America first, that were putting their profits ahead of public goodwill,” said Douglas Brinkley, a presidential historian and Roosevelt biographer. “He did it with his fingers pointed in the face of his enemies. He would call bankers out by name.” In the century since Roosevelt served, Brinkley said, no president has used the bully pulpit to strong-arm companies in such a relentless and aggressive manner — until Trump. “Other presidents would show up at the Harley factory and say, ‘This is made in America. Isn’t that wonderful?’ ” Brinkley said. “But they would never go into a mano-a-mano war about bringing jobs back to America, not since Theodore Roosevelt.” Trump said in an interview last week with The Washington Post that his early moves to badger Boeing and Lockheed Martin to bring down the costs of their aircraft — Air Force One and the F-35 fighter jet, respectively — were examples of the power of his voice. “Look at what’s going on with the airplanes, the F-35. We’re saving such amounts of money. Look at what’s going on with Air Force One. Look at what’s going on with the auto plants,” Trump said. “And by the way, I’m not micromanaging.” Whether Trump considers it micromanaging, he is undeniably meddling in the affairs of private companies to a greater degree than many previous presidents. “Trump is in many ways closer to a governor than to our traditional model of president,” Gingrich said. “Governors around the country all behave like Trump: They worry about specific jobs, specific factories, specific companies. The Washington model is always abstract policy. But he’s gone straight for the jugular to say, ‘I want jobs!’ ” Gingrich described the president-elect as a tireless entrepreneur determined to see results, and recalled Trump’s management of the Wollmann Rink in New York’s Central Park. The outdoor skating rink was in disrepair in the 1980s when Trump persuaded then-Mayor Ed Koch to take over the renovations himself. The rink reopened with great fanfare, under budget and ahead of schedule, becoming one of Trump’s biggest success stories, which he later chronicled in his 1987 bestseller, “The Art of the Deal.” Trump’s focus on pressuring companies to create U.S. jobs could be politically advantageous. He owes his electoral victory to the Rust Belt — Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, whose manufacturing-based economies have been decimated over the past four decades by outsourcing and broader trends of globalization. “He understands better than anybody on his team that there are two criteria for his reelection: Is America safe, and did we create jobs?” Gingrich said. “If he can run with genuine prosperity — not this phony statistical prosperity that’s all baloney — then he’s golden.” Brinkley agreed: “He’s going to live or die by jobs. He can get away with a lot of eccentric activity if he stays out of war and if the economy does well.” Karen Tumulty contributed to this report. politics Dallas shooting updates News and analysis on the deadliest day for police since 9/11. post_newsletter353 follow-dallas false endOfArticle false Please provide a valid email address.

Sonny Perdue, R-Ga. By Cathy Burke   |   Wednesday, 18 Jan 2017 08:11 PM Close  More ways to share... Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    President-elect Donald Trump will name former Georgia Gov. Sonny Perdue as his nominee to lead the $140 billion Department of Agriculture, Fox News reported Wednesday night. The news broke on Fox Business Network's "Lou Dobbs Tonight." CNN's Jim Acosta tweeted the news as well. Fmr GA Gov Sonny Perdue to be named Agriculture Secretary, Trump's last cabinet pick, CNN confirms. — Jim Acosta (@Acosta) January 19, 2017 Perdue's cousin, Georgia Sen. David Perdue, seemed to confirm the news, issuing a press release, saying, "I could not be more proud of my cousin, Sonny, for being named the next Secretary of Agriculture. . . . I am confident Sonny will work hard to advance smart agriculture policies that will help our farmers, ranchers, and rural communities across the country." The 70-year-old Perdue served on Trump's agricultural advisory committee during the presidential campaign. He would be the first agriculture secretary from a Southern state since Mike Espy of Mississippi headed the department in the early 1990s, according to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.  Perdue met with Trump shortly after Thanksgiving, the newspaper reported. "He asked me what my skills sets were, and I told him what they were, aside from having been governor, as a business person and primarily in agricultural commodities, trading domestically and internationally. And he lit up," Perdue said after the meeting, the newspaper reported. "He knew what it takes to make America great again by doing the things we do well, which is agriculture for one and to free up farmers from the regulations that we see. He was spot on on those issues." A veterinarian-turned-politician with a long history in middle Georgia agribusinesses, Perdue helped craft Georgia agriculture policy in the 1990s as a Democratic state senator from Houston County before switching to the GOP in 1998, the Journal-Constitution reported. His surprise victory over Gov. Roy Barnes in 2002 – making him Georgia’s first GOP governor since Reconstruction – triggered a Republican wave in Georgia that flipped the state Senate and then the state House, the newspaper noted. As governor, Perdue championed legislation aimed at cracking down on illegal immigration and new photo ID requirements. By nominating a former governor from a Southern state, Trump eschewed candidates from major Farm Belt states in the Midwest that produce the bulk of crops such as corn, soybeans and wheat which dominate agriculture exports. Georgia is a key producer of crops such as cotton and peanuts. While Georgia governor, Perdue had to handle a severe drought in 2007, during which he took steps to cut water usage and at one point led a service outside the state capitol to pray for rain. Ron Moore, president of the American Soybean Association (ASA), said he thought Perdue would support agriculture exports. "I think he will be very much in favor of trade," Moore said in a telephone interview. The ASA, with 15 other farm groups, this month urged the incoming administration to "protect and enhance" agricultural trade and its impact on the rural economy. Trade, a signature issue during the campaign in which Trump accused China of unfair practices, is critical for the farm economy. U.S. farm and food exports to China were more than $20.2 billion in 2015. Prices for soybeans rose 16.2 percent during 2016 on strong demand from China, which buys nearly 30 percent of the U.S. crop. Soybean exports helped boost U.S. gross domestic product in the third quarter. Some farmers are concerned that Trump's criticism of China could lead to deteriorating trade relations and put exports at risk. An influential Chinese state-run newspaper warned this week that U.S. agricultural imports and U.S. aircraft manufacturer Boeing Co could be targets for retaliation in any trade war ushered in by Trump. Zippy Duvall, president of the American Farm Bureau, praised Perdue as a strong voice. But environmental groups opposed the nominee. "Farmers need a champion in the USDA who will fight for conservation programs to help farmers be more resilient in the face of extreme weather, not pray for rain," Kari Hamerschlag, deputy director of food and technology at Friends of the Earth, said in a statement.
