(AP photo byElaine Thompson) Print Email The Associated Press By The Associated Press The Associated Press on September 07, 2016 at 11:30 AM comments WASHINGTON — From 2002 through early last year, the Pentagon conducted 11 flight tests of the nation's homeland missile defense system. In the carefully scripted exercises, interceptors of the Ground-based Midcourse Defense system, or GMD, were launched from underground silos to pursue mock enemy warheads high above the Pacific. The interceptors failed to destroy their targets in six of the 11 tests — a record that has prompted independent experts to conclude the system cannot be relied on to foil a nuclear strike by North Korea or Iran. Yet over that same timespan, Boeing Co., the Pentagon's prime contractor for GMD, collected nearly $2 billion in performance bonuses for a job well done. The Pentagon paid Boeing more than $21 billion total for managing the system during that period. A Times investigation also found that the criteria for the yearly bonuses were changed at some point to de-emphasize the importance of test results that demonstrate the system's ability to intercept and destroy incoming warheads. Early on, Boeing's contract specified that bonuses would be based primarily on "hit to kill success" in flight tests. In later years, the words "hit to kill" were removed in favor of more generally phrased benchmarks, contract documents show. L. David Montague, co-chair of a National Academy of Sciences panel that documented shortcomings with GMD, called the $2 billion in bonuses "mind-boggling," given the system's performance. Montague, a former president of missile systems for Lockheed Corp., said the bonuses suggest that the Missile Defense Agency, the arm of the Pentagon that oversees GMD, is a "rogue organization" in need of strict supervision. The cumulative total of bonuses paid to Boeing has not been made public before. The Times obtained details about the payments through a lawsuit it filed against the Defense Department under the Freedom of Information Act. The newspaper also reviewed Boeing-related contract documents obtained independently of the lawsuit. A spokesman for the missile agency, Chris Johnson, said that despite the GMD system's record in flight tests, Boeing had "earned" its bonuses "based on the criteria specified in the contract." He said the payments "complied with all appropriate acquisition regulations." "These types of contracts allow regular and consistent evaluation by the government, and fees are paid only when companies meet clearly defined targets," Johnson said in an emailed statement. A spokesman for Boeing, Dexter Q. Henson, referred questions about the bonuses to the missile agency while defending the company's work on GMD. Boeing "has met contractual requirements and a variety of incentives across a wide range of program objectives," Henson said by email. "As the lead contractor, we have partnered with the Missile Defense Agency in the development and operation of the only homeland defense system that can defeat long range missile attacks," he said. The GMD system, which became operational in 2004, is intended to thwart a "limited" nuclear strike by a non-superpower. It has cost taxpayers more than $40 billion to date. In the event of an attack, interceptors at Vandenberg Air Force Base in Santa Barbara County, Calif., and Fort Greely, Alaska, would burst from their silos and begin a fiery ascent toward the upper atmosphere. The interceptors are multistage rockets, each with a 5-foot-long "kill vehicle" at its tip. The kill vehicle is designed to separate from its rocket in space, fly independently at 4 miles per second and crash into an enemy warhead. GMD's roots go back to the Clinton administration, when concern began to mount over the spread of ballistic missile technology. In 2002, President George W. Bush ordered "an initial set of missile defense capabilities" to be put in place within two years. To accelerate deployment, then-Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld exempted the missile agency from the Pentagon's standard procurement rules and testing standards. The Pentagon's own Operational Test and Evaluation office has documented serious deficiencies in the system. So have other government agencies and independent experts. In a report in February, the Government Accountability Office, a nonpartisan investigative arm of Congress, said the system's performance in tests has been "insufficient to demonstrate that an operationally useful defense capability exists." The test failures are unsettling given that the exercises are meticulously orchestrated. Personnel operating the GMD system know ahead of time approximately when the targets will be launched and from where, as well their expected speed and trajectory — information they would not have in an actual attack. Given the system's weaknesses, four or five interceptors would have to be launched for each incoming enemy warhead, according to current and former officials familiar with the missile agency's projections. As a result, the system's arsenal of 30 operational interceptors — four at Vandenberg and 26 at Fort Greely — could be quickly depleted by an attack with multiple missiles. A study by three physicists with expertise in missile defense, released in July by the Union of Concerned Scientists, concluded that "the GMD system is simply unable to protect the U.S. public." The Times asked the Missile Defense Agency in March 2014 for information on bonuses paid to GMD contractors. Boeing objected to release of the data, and the agency denied the newspaper's request, saying disclosure might reveal "trade secrets and commercial or financial data." The Times then sued in federal court last year, asserting that the public had a right to know about the payments. The government's lawyers later agreed to release the information if Boeing would not intervene in the litigation "or otherwise take steps to prevent disclosure." Boeing eventually acquiesced, and the Defense Department settled the suit with a single-page letter listing the sum total of bonuses paid to Boeing from Dec. 31, 2001, to March 1, 2015. The figure: $1,959,072,946. The government also agreed to pay $15,000 to cover the Times' legal costs. The missile agency's chief of staff, David P. Bagnati, made the initial decision to withhold the bonus data, according to a 2014 email from the Pentagon's Freedom of Information office. Johnson, the agency spokesman, said this week that Bagnati "made the determination on the advice of agency legal counsel" and would have no further comment. Boeing holds two contracts to manage GMD. Under their terms, the company is reimbursed for its direct costs in overseeing the system and for some of its indirect costs, such as executive salaries and other overhead. The bonuses come on top of that and can account for all or a significant part of a contractor's profit. One of Boeing's GMD contracts also provides a 3 percent base fee, independent of any bonuses, for some aspects of the work, according to the missile agency. Under the contracts, bonuses are awarded annually and can be up to 100 percent of specified pools of money. The Defense Department letter that settled the Times' lawsuit said the Boeing bonuses fell into three categories. Ninety-five percent of the total sum was designated as "award fees." The rest was described as "incentive cost" fees and "incentive performance" fees. The precise criteria for bonuses could not be obtained for each of the relevant years. However, documents on file with the Defense and Treasury departments show that the missile agency at some point altered a central criterion. At issue was what would make a flight test count as successful for bonus purposes. Boeing's prime contract dated Jan. 1, 2001, states that "the primary performance criteria" were whether the interceptor destroyed its target during the test — an outcome described as "HTK success." (HTK is short for "hit to kill.") The maximum "award fee" for a given year was 15 percent of the contract value. During the first phase of the contract, up to 60 percent of the award fee pool was based on "HTK success criteria." Later contract documents, dated August 2011, list various bonus criteria related to preparing for and carrying out the next scheduled flight test. Successful "mission execution" was worth 30 percent of the award fee pool. But actually destroying the target — "hit to kill" —was no longer specified. Asked for an explanation, Johnson, the agency spokesman, said: "In recent contract terms, the words 'hit-to-kill' have been changed to support the more detailed documented objectives of each respective flight test. For intercept flight tests conducted under the current design and sustainment contract, a successful intercept remains a key performance objective." In 2010, the missile agency granted Boeing a contract extension worth more than $1 billion. The Defense Department's inspector general later raised questions about the extension — including bonus payments — saying that agency officials lost an opportunity to save millions of dollars by failing to wait for an audit they had requested. The controversy centered on the GMD "Core Completion" contract. (The inspector general's report, released in 2014, did not name Boeing, but other records show that the company held this contract.) According to the report, the missile agency asked the Defense Contract Audit Agency to scrutinize the contractor's proposed costs and other terms. The audit was due Feb. 15, 2010, but the auditors asked for an additional month, the report said. Yet the missile agency signed the contract extension March 10, 2010 — five days before the auditors were to deliver their findings. The inspector general concluded that if agency officials had waited to see the audit, they "could have negotiated a significantly lower contract value and saved the government millions of dollars in reduced fees" — a reference to bonuses, which are based on the total contract value. Johnson said officials chose not to wait "because we had sufficient data to reach a determination of a fair and reasonable price for the contract." He added that his agency "has incorporated several substantial changes to our procedures" to make better use of future audits. The missile agency and its lead contractors have sought to put a positive spin on the system's performance. This year, after a flight test on Jan. 28, the agency and several contractors, including Boeing, issued news releases declaring the test a success. In fact, as the Times reported July 6, a thruster stopped working during the exercise, causing the kill vehicle to fly far off its intended course. The thrusters, which help steer the kill vehicle, have a history of performance problems. In the Jan. 28 exercise, a kill vehicle equipped with a new thruster model was supposed to make a close fly-by of a target. None of the press releases acknowledged the malfunction — nor did the missile agency's director, Vice Adm. James D. Syring, in three subsequent appearances before congressional panels. Neither Syring nor the contractors have said publicly why they stayed silent. Whatever their rationale, by characterizing the test as a success, the agency and the contractors may have bolstered the prospects for performance bonuses, according to missile defense specialists.

In September 2014, SpaceX and Boeing were awarded contracts under NASA's commercial crew program to help them start flying astronauts on missions to the space station from U.S. soil in the next few years. SpaceX and Boeing are planning to launch a series of tests of their spaceships — capsules called Dragon V2 and the CST-100, respectively — from this year through 2017. The tests will make sure the launch systems are in good shape before the spacecraft make their first official runs to and from the station. Seats aboard Dragon and the CST-100 should also be cheaper than the current cost to launch people to space. NASA has relied on Russian Soyuz spacecraft to deliver astronauts to the orbiting outpost since the end of the space shuttle program in 2011; at the moment, NASA is paying about $70 million for each Soyuz seat. [ The Top 10 Private Spaceships ] The space agency has required that commercial providers like Boeing and SpaceX meet or go below a $58 million average price per seat, according to NASA officials. Both Boeing and SpaceX representatives have said that their per-seat cost is at or below the current price of a Soyuz seat. "The contracts we've signed with our industry partners Boeing and SpaceX are vivid examples of American innovation at work," NASA administrator Charles Bolden said in a news conference Monday. "We've seen the return of an American launch industry and the in-sourcing of work and jobs back to U.S. shores. Our reliance on a commercial space enterprise where we hand off low-Earth orbit transportation to the private sector is critical to our journey to Mars." Budgets and contracts SpaceX is receiving $2.6 billion of the $6.8 billion total contract, with Boeing awarded the other $4.2 billion. Since receiving the funding, the two companies have been steadily working toward meeting various new milestones within the program. Advertise Advertise Advertise Bolden is also optimistic that the forthcoming federal budget proposal from the White House — scheduled to be released next week — will treat the commercial crew program well. "Congress has started to understand the critical importance of commercial crew and cargo," Bolden said. "They've seen, as a result of the performance of our providers, that this is not a hoax, it's not a myth, it's not a dream. It's something that's really happening. I am optimistic that the Congress will accept the President's proposal for commercial crew for 2016." SpaceX getting ready to fly SpaceX's plans under the commercial crew program are expected to heat up this year. The company plans to launch its first abort test for Dragon "in the next month or so," SpaceX COO and president Gwynne Shotwell said during the news conference. The company is then expected to perform a second abort test later in 2015, Shotwell added. After those two tests — which are designed to show how Dragon V2 would respond in the event of a problem during liftoff— SpaceX representatives are hoping to launch an uncrewed test flight using the company's Falcon 9 rocket in late 2016, with its first crewed mission using the launch system coming shortly after that, in early 2017. "We certainly understand the incredible … responsibility that we've been given to build the systems necessary and capable of flying crew," Shotwell said. Boeing getting ready for 2017 Boeing should start launching many of its test flights in 2017, said John Elbon, Vice President and General Manager of Boeing Space Exploration. The CST-100 is designed to fly to space atop a United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket. Boeing is expected to perform a pad abort test of its CST-100 spacecraft in 2017, with the first uncrewed flight to the space station launching in April 2017. Boeing's first crewed flight to the station should occur in July 2017 with a Boeing pilot and NASA astronaut aboard, according to Elbon. The company's first official mission to the station should happen before the end of 2017, Elbon added. "Lots of great progress," Elbon said. "We're on track, and it's just as exciting as can be to be part of it." Quiz: How Well Do You Know SpaceX's Dragon Spaceship?

Daniel Miller (TMFTwoCoins) Sep 7, 2016 at 8:05AM Image source: Getty Images. "You only have to do a very few things right in your life so long as you don't do too many things wrong." -- Warren Buffett He's right: more often than not, if you simply hold on to a stock over the years through thick and thin, you'll likely be well rewarded. It can be difficult to never sell, especially when times seem dire -- but if you can pick companies with durable competitive advantages, you should be able to sleep at night and avoid pressing the panic "sell" button. Here are four Motley Fool contributors with companies that they recommend never selling: International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM), Allergan (NYSE:AGN), Enterprise Products Partners (NYSE:EPD), and Boeing Co. (NYSE:BA). A century of adaptation Tim Green: Every stock that I buy I intend to hold for years. Ideally, a stock will produce exceptional returns indefinitely, never requiring me to sell. Things change, of course, and investors can't be afraid to sell a stock if their thesis has been turned upside down. But in general, the longer the holding period, the better. Predicting how technology will evolve is hard, if not impossible, and that makes committing to holding a technology stock indefinitely risky. But International Business Machines, a company that has been around for a century, is one tech stock that I'm comfortable holding for a long time. The company has transformed itself on multiple occasions during its lifetime, shifting from mechanical tabulating machines to computers, then transitioning into a software and services company, and now throwing its weight behind cloud and cognitive computing. Transitions are always painful, and the current one IBM is undergoing is no exception. Revenue has been declining for years, and earnings are being pressured as the company shifts resources from legacy businesses to areas that offer the most potential. There's no guarantee that IBM will succeed, but if I'm going to be holding a tech stock for a very long time, a company with a long history of adaptation makes the most sense. This high-growth pharma stock has a solid foundation George Budwell: There aren't many stocks I would absolutely never sell, but specialty pharma Allergan is an exception to the rule. The short story is that Allergan is currently in the process of shedding its generic-drug business to focus on branded products like the double-chin treatment Kybella, and the IBS drugs Linzess and Viberzi, among many others. As a result, the health of the drugmaker's balance sheet has improved dramatically in the last few months, with the company already retiring $9 billion in debt this year. And Allergan's recent double-digit top-line growth appears to be sustainable for the long haul, given that the drugmaker is in the midst of multiple new product launches at the moment. Having said that, Allergan's penchant for wheeling and dealing is an area of concern. So far, management has carefully guided the company through multiple acquisitions that have led to an overall healthier enterprise. However, one bad deal in the pharmaceutical industry can hamper a company's growth for a decade or more. That's why I would personally prefer for Allergan to pay off even more debt, and perhaps sit tight for the time being, instead of rushing out to spend its recent windfall from the sale of its generic unit. But this is Allergan, after all, meaning that a monstrous acquisition is almost certainly coming down the pike soon. So, hopefully, management can continue their winning ways by adding yet another value-creating asset to the company's already strong product portfolio of branded medicines. Stay tuned. An anchor income holding Matt DiLallo: Midstream pipeline giant Enterprise Products Partners has been a part of my portfolio since 2007. I plan on keeping it right where it is, and adding to my position over time, because I view it as an anchor income holding. It is a decision that paid off very well in the past, and one that I expect will continue for many years to come. What drew me toward Enterprise Products Partners was its eye-popping yield, which at the time of my initial investment was just shy of 7%. However, since my first purchase, the distribution has gone up every single quarter. Because of that, the yield on my initial investment is now more than 11.5%. Three factors drive Enterprise's ability to grow the payout. First, it primarily owns fee-based assets that are under long-term contracts, so it generates rather stable cash flow. Second, unlike most master limited partnerships, it does not distribute all of its cash flow back to investors; instead, it retains a substantial portion to reinvest into growth projects, including $5.3 billion since 2011. Finally, the company continues to construct a steady stream of fee-based assets that drive cash-flow growth; currently, it has $5.6 billion of projects under construction to drive growth through 2018. With a solid foundation and ample running room for future growth, Enterprise Products Partners is one company that I have no desire to sell. Still flying high Daniel Miller: Investors hopping off the Boeing Co. bandwagon could be forgiven, especially after a rough second quarter, when the aviation juggernaut took almost $3 billion in pre-tax charges from its 787, 747 and KC-46 tanker programs. However, despite the rough quarter, Boeing still has durable comparable advantages with its commercial and defense businesses, which make it a stock you shouldn't sell. Boeing operates in an intensely regulated commercial aircraft industry, so it's extremely difficult for new competitors to enter the market, leaving Boeing and Airbus to dominate the area. There are very real barriers to entry imposed by the knowledge and experience required to develop, design, assemble and certify commercial aircraft; that isn't changing any time soon, which is great news for investors willing to stick around for the long haul. Another bonus is that over the past five years, Boeing has increasingly focused on returning value to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, as you can see below: BA Shares Outstanding data by YCharts. And despite being in a cyclical industry, Boeing has more than $470 billion worth of orders in its combined commercial and defense backlog, which is roughly five years' worth of revenue transparency. On top of that, Boeing made the decision to incrementally improve both the 737 and 777 programs, rather than develop all-new aircraft, which should generate more cash flow and increase its return on invested capital. The downside with Boeing is that the company operates in a cyclical industry, which guarantees turbulence at some point, and when operational mistakes happen they cost a pretty penny – see Boeing's second quarter. But any company that operates in an industry with steep barriers to entry and has a history of returning value to shareholders is a company you shouldn't sell anytime soon.

Even the $85 billion calculated by the Pentagon's Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation office is a placeholder number that's at the low end of potential costs, according to an Aug. 23 memo from Pentagon weapons buyer Frank Kendall to Air Force Secretary Deborah James. It includes $22.6 billion for research and development, $61.5 billion for procurement and $718 million for related military construction. VIDEOS TOP JOBS Lockheed Martin Corp., Boeing Co. and Northrop Grumman Corp. are all competing to build the new ICBMs. But the latest estimate may add to debate about the cost and need for the planned modernization of all three legs of the U.S. nuclear triad of land, air and sea weapons. The nuclear modernization plan contributes to what defense analysts call a gathering "bow wave" of spending in the coming decade on major weapons that the next presidents will face. At this stage of the ICBM program "there is significant uncertainty about program costs" because "the historical data is limited and there has been a long gap since the last" such development program, Kendall wrote. The $85 billion estimate must be revised no later than March 2018 once missile designs are more advanced, technical risks are reduced and the service has a better understanding of overall costs, Kendall said in the memo. Nonetheless, Kendall approved proceeding with early development and efforts to reduce technology risks of the new ICBM. He directed the service to move toward buying 642 missiles at an average cost of $66.4 million each to support a deployed force of 400 weapons and to budget at least $1.25 billion annually from 2036 to 2040 for operations and support costs. The Pentagon's ability to estimate the cost of the new Ground Based Strategic Deterrent was limited by the "incompleteness and significant age of" the "data for comparable ICBM and submarine launched ballistic missiles dating back to the 1960s through the early 1990s," Kendall wrote. The Pentagon and Air Force are "accepting greater risk by going with" the $85 billion estimate that's at the lower end of its calculations, Kingston Reif, an analyst with the Arms Control Association in Washington who follows the program, said in an e-mail. "From a good-government perspective" it is "better to build in contingency and plan for and prioritize around a bigger bill now, lest a sudden big cost increase threaten to wreck the budget and the program five to 10 years from now." Kendall wrote that inflation assumptions and the defense industry's capability to produce the missiles are major sources of cost uncertainty. Still, he said the $85 billion placeholder is "the most reasonable estimate of program cost at this point." In addition to the new nuclear systems, the bow wave of coming costs includes nine Air Force conventional systems and plans for increased construction of naval vessels such as a second Ford-class aircraft carrier. For the air component of the nuclear triad, Northrop defeated a Lockheed-Boeing team in October for the right to build a new dual-use bomber that can carry both nuclear and conventional weapons, a project valued at as much as $80 billion. At sea, the Navy is planning to replace its Ohio-class nuclear-armed submarines through a production program now estimated at $122 billion, which doesn't include development.That estimate will be updated by year's end as the Pentagon reviews moving the program into full development. Kendall's decision to let the ICBM program move forward marks the official beginning of the technology development stage, with spending increasing from about $75 million this year to $1.6 billion in 2021 and $2.6 billion in 2022, according to the Pentagon estimate. The "program plans to buy enough missiles to maintain a 400-missile deployed force through 2075," Air Force spokeswoman Leah Bryant said in an email. "The overall number of missiles acquired in the inventory may vary depending on testing, evaluation, maintenance," she said. The Air Force made its early estimate last year that the new ICBM program would cost $62.3 billion for research, development and production as well as command and control systems and infrastructure. That number, as well as the new $85 billion estimate, is calculated in so-called "then-year," or current-year, dollars. Bryant said "it is important to keep in mind that at this stage," as "in any acquisition program, there can still be some uncertainty about projected" ICBM costs because "the historical data used for estimates, whether ours or another organization's estimate, are limited and very dated." The last ICBM development occurred in the 1980s, she said. Kendall's memo was provided to the staff of the Senate and House defense committees last week.   Share This Article JOIN THE DISCUSSION     Post a Comment POPULAR STORIES It's not easy being black at BYU, film shows Utah lawmakers: Time to take 'training wheels' off booming solar industry, retire tax credit Garrison Keillor: Politics is not everything.

Henry Oludotun Ogunyemi has reiterated that Nigeria will retain over $3 billion, the equivalent of over N1. 2 trillion annually if operating airlines patronizes local maintenance facilities to carry out heavy maintenance on their aircraft. He spoke at the background of the challenges government and the private sector face in trying to establish a maintenance hangar to take care of the heavy maintenance needs of Nigerian carriers and that of other countries. While disclosing that Onedot has received approval from the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA) to carry out heavy maintenance on some category of aircraft, he urges government to address debilitating challenges of sourcing foreign currencies for the maintenance of their as result of the Federal Government Forex policy. The airlines’ maintenance challenge is further compounded by the foreign exchange rate to carry out major checks such as C- and D-Checks on their airplanes. He hinted that flying aircraft overseas for heavy maintenance like C-Checks on Boeing aircraft now has a far greater cost implication and the ripple effect causes major financial havoc for airlines advising airlines to use local Maintain Repair and Overhaul(MROs). Onedot Aviation approval to carry out maintenance checks both line and heavy for Beechcraft, HS-125, Bombardier among others since 2014 and Boeing 737-200 Series and Boeing 737-300/400/500 series in June 2016. Ogunyemi further stated that Onedot Aviation had already successfully carried out a B-Check on an Air Stream’s Boeing 737-200 cargo aircraft, which is currently flying perfectly. He encouraged other domestic airlines to follow suit, as the services rendered by Onedot Aviation are top notch, as the company has qualified engineers and state of the art tech. He stated that Onedot could also reduce the frenzy for forex as it would charge the airlines in Naira, adding that one of the benefits of carrying out MROs locally is that it would save airlines a lot of funds which according to him can lead to business expansion for such airlines. According to him, “First, putting all the airlines’ maintenance together, Nigeria will be saving $3billon annually if we patronise our own local MROs. There will be reduced stress on the dollar currency and this cut across all the airlines. It is cheaper for the airlines to carry out their maintenance in the country. First and foremost, the ferry cost is saved as it takes time to ferry an aircraft to an from wherever it is done overseas. “ “Even the ground time is saved as sometimes some aircraft stay six months and others stay a year so the airline will save in ground time. Saving money and ground time increases the profit of the airline. Airlines are free to check our services out.” He continued, “With increase of profit, there can also be an increase in fleet which means increment of staff, pilots and cabin crew employing more Nigerians, creating more jobs. In fact, the ripple effect is so numerous and cannot be underscored. Assuming they are not expanding or recruiting, they will be able to pay their staff and not owe, eliminating unnecessary hardships.” He also said using local MROs would enable the maintenance organisation increase its capacity, train and employ more Nigerians as well. In his words, “We have experienced Base engineers in Nigeria already that can take over from the expatriates who are already on ground with the initial know-how and technology. With the MRO there will be jobs for the teeming engineers and retraining of engineers to keep a base of sound technical hands who hitherto flew overseas.” that we have now.

The department developed a 3D printed trim-and-drill tool that has received the title of largest solid 3D printed item by Guinness World Records. The tool took only 30 hours to print using carbon fiber and ABS thermoplastic composite materials. Aerospace giant Boeing will be testing the effectiveness of the tool for its Boeing 777X passenger jet. At 17.5 feet long, 5.5 feet wide and 1.5 feet tall, the 3D printed structure is comparable in length to a large sport utility vehicle and weighs approximately 1,650 pounds. Boeing is currently using other tooling options that are much more expensive and takes approximately the months for suppliers to manufacture with conventional techniques. “Additively manufactured tools, such as the 777X wing trim tool, will save energy, time, labor and production cost and are part of our overall strategy to apply 3D printing technology in key production areas,” explains Leo Christodoulou, Boeing’s director of structures and materials. The new tooling component was printed at DOE’s Manufacturing Demonstration Facility at ORNL. The lab has a Big Area Additive Manufacturing machine and Guinness World Record judge Michael Empric measured the trim tool, proved it exceeded the required minimum of 0.3 cubic meters, or approximately 10.6 cubic feet, and announced the new record title. “The recognition by Guinness World Records draws attention to the advances we’re making in large-scale additive manufacturing composites research,” said Vlastimil Kunc, leader of ORNL’s polymer materials development team. “Using 3D printing, we could design the tool with less material and without compromising its function.” Boeing is expected to use the additively manufactured trim-and-drill tool in its new production facility in St. Louis. The tool will be used to secure the jet’s composite wing skin for drilling and machining before assembly. The aerospace giant will then provide ORNL feedback on the tool’s performance. www.ornl.gov Share Tweet Facebook LinkedIn Google+ Tags 3D printing ORNL tooling Related ORNL researchers design and 3D print excavator prototype Airbus partners with Renishaw to explore 3D printing aircraft wings Researchers develop an octopus-inspired 3D printed robot 2 Comments » for Researchers develop the world’s largest solid 3D printed tool for aircraft manufacturing James says: September 8, 2016 at 5:54 pm It’s amazing what people can make these days with a 3d printer, things can only get better bring on 4d printing.

The passenger jet then lifted off again for a “go-around” but within seconds lost altitude and then impacted the runway as the wheels were retracting back into the undercarriage of the fuselage, said the report on the August 3 accident. Despite the plane catching fire as it slid on its belly along Runway 12L at Dubai International Airport, 282 passengers and 18 crew aboard flight EK521 from Thiruvananthapuram, India were evacuated safely. The report dated September 5 by the GCAA (General Civil Aviation Authority) said early investigation revealed there were wind changes in the moments of final approach before the plane impacted the runway. “Approach controller and the WM [watch manager] remarked on these wind conditions as being strange,” the report stated. Flight environment “During the landing and attempted go-around, the aircraft was in a rapidly changing and dynamic flight environment. The initial touchdown and transition of the aircraft from air to ground mode, followed by the lift-off and the changes in the aircraft configuration in the attempted go-around, involved operational modes, logics and inhibits of a number of systems, including the autothrottle, the air/ground system, the weather radar, and the GPWS. The characteristics of these systems, and others, will be examined during the course of the investigation.” According to the report, the 34-year-old commander flying the plane was an experienced pilot with almost 7,500 flying hours in total and more than 5,000 flying hours on the Boeing 777 aircraft type involved in the incident. “Post-accident blood tests did not reveal psychoactive materials that could have degraded the crew performance,” the report said.

Approximately nine minutes after the aircraft came to rest, a firefighter was fatally injured as a result of the explosion of the centre fuel tank.”   Click to read the full report in PDF  The initial report stems from the formation of a team by the GCAA assisted by Emirates, Boeing and engine maker Rolls Royce. In its initial report in a full investigation expected to take from three to five months, the report stated that after the aborted landing, the “aircraft reached a maximum height of approximately 85 feet RA at 134 knots IAS, with the landing gear in transit to the retracted position. The aircraft then began to sink back onto the runway. Both crewmembers recalled seeing the IAS decreasing and the Copilot called out ‘Check speed’. At 0837:35, three seconds before impact with the runway, both thrust levers were moved from the idle position to full forward. The autothrottle transitioned from idle to thrust mode. Approximately one second later, a ground proximity warning system (GPWS) aural warning of ‘Don’t sink, don’t sink’ was annunciated,” the report said. “One second before impact, both engines started to respond to the thrust lever movement showing an increase in related parameters. At 0837:38, the aircraft aft fuselage impacted the runway abeam the November 7 intersection at 125 knots, with a nose-up pitch angle of 9.5 degrees, and at a rate of descent of 900 feet per minute. This was followed by the impact of the engines on the runway. The three landing gears were still in transit to the retracted position.” The accident marks the first time in Emirates’ 31-year history that the airline suffered irreparable damage to one of its aircraft. Emirates welcomes report In a statement to Gulf News on Tuesday, Emirates said it “welcomes the publication of the preliminary report by the United Arab Emirates (UAE) General Civil Aviation Authority Air Accident Investigations Sector (GCAA- AAIS) on the accident involving flight EK521 on 3 August 2016. As this is a Preliminary Report based on the facts gathered so far during the on-going investigation, it does not cover causes of the accident nor does it make final safety recommendations. We will review the report carefully.” A spokesperson said: “Emirates is also conducting its own rigorous internal investigation to proactively review what we know about the accident, and consider measures that may enhance our operations or procedures. We would like to take this opportunity to thank the investigating authorities for their continued commitment to the investigation of this accident. Emirates will continue to extend our full co-operation as they work towards the Final Report.” Report highlights * After the aircraft came to rest, fire was emanating from the No. 2 engine, the damaged RH engine-pylon wing attachment area and from under the aircraft fuselage. Approximately one minute after, the commander transmitted a “Mayday” call and informed air traffic control that the aircraft was being evacuated. * Apart from the Commander and the senior cabin crewmember, who both jumped from the L1 door onto the detached slide, crewmembers and passengers evacuated the aircraft using the escape slides. When the aircraft impacted and slid along the runway, passengers started to unfasten their seatbelts and stand up. An announcement was made for the passengers to remain seated. When the Aircraft came to rest, some passengers were screaming, grabbing their belongings, and asking the cabin crewmembers to open the doors. The cabin crewmembers followed the operator’s safety instructions that prohibit passengers taking their carry-on baggage during an evacuation, and they instructed the passengers to leave their bags behind. However, several passengers evacuated the aircraft carrying their baggage. Footage of the evacuation showed a number of passengers outside the aircraft with their baggage. * The Commander and senior cabin crewmember were last to exit the aircraft. * The plane was totally destroyed * The plane damaged 12 aerodrome lights and seven signs which required replacement as follows: Source: GCAA Accident Preliminary Report  More Pictures Expand Share your views.

Monday, December 22, 2014 - 02:24 Qatar Airways takes first delivery of Airbus' new A350 passenger jet. As Joel Flynn reports it's the planemaker's response to the Boeing 787 Dreamliner and the culmination of eight years of development. ▲ Hide Transcript ▶ View Transcript A big moment for Airbus as it delivers its latest aircraft model to Qatar Airways. The A350-XWB - or extra wide body - is heralded by some as a technological leap forward. Airbus is also hoping it will be an industry gamechanger. Qatar Airways chief, Akbar Al Baker. SOUNDBITE: Qatar Airways Group CEO, Akbar Al Baker, saying (English): "From the inception of the A350 programme until now, we have watched this dynamic aircraft to be truly ahead of the curve and a global phenomenon." The technology in the A350 is one of the biggest attractions. It's made from lighter materials - which means fuel savings of 30 percent - and it offers airlines better and more comfortable cabin design, for economy and first class. As always it's designed to compete with Boeing. Fabrice Bregier is the CEO of Airbus. SOUNDBITE: Airbus CEO, Fabrice Bregier, saying (English): "In fact we have two big members of the family, one - the 900, behind me - and mid-2017 we will also deliver a stretched version, which is called -1000. We will have more passengers, we'll have exactly the size of a 777-ER, which was the reference in this business, and the beauty of the 350-1000 is we will have 25 percent less fuel consumption." This is a market valued at 1.9 trillion dollars over the next two decades. Sales of the A350 have already hit 778, compared to Boeing's 1,055 Dreamliner orders. Not bad for an aircraft that nearly didn't happen. Ten years ago Airbus came within a whisper of burying the model. IG's Chris Beauchamp. SOUNDBITE: IG Market Analyst, Chris Beauchamp, saying (English): "Airbus has really been on the backfoot over the last couple of years against its bigger American rival. It's a good sign I think, and the testing and use of it in Qatar will bear that one out and we'll see if we can boost some more orders and leverage further business off the back of the that." Airbus is now keen to scotch rumours about the future of its flagship A380 superjumbo. But Boeing has its own problems - the 787 Dreamliner brand still bearing reputational scars from a series of technical problems last year. Whether the A350 is the Airbus model to steal the initiative over Boeing will depend on whether other airlines order it next year.

 Russia is squeezing NASA for more than $3.3 billion — and there's little anyone can do about it Dave Mosher Sep. 2, 2016, 12:28 PM 15,195 facebook linkedin twitter email print A Russian Soyuz spacecraft launches from the Baikonur Cosmodrome on July 7, 2016. NASA will end up paying $81 million per seat by 2018. Bill Ingalls/NASA via Getty Images NASA is in quite a financial pickle with the Russians. When the agency retired its space shuttle program in 2011, it was banking on commercial carriers — ultimately SpaceX and Boeing — to design, build, and test proven systems to launch its astronauts into space by 2015. But those plans have been waylaid by 3 years, according to a buck-stopping audit by NASA's Office of Inspector General (OIG) on Thursday, Sept. 1, 2016. This leaves the agency with one option for sending astronauts to and from the International Space Station (ISS) 220 miles above Earth: a Russian spacecraft called the Soyuz. And Russia is taking full advantage of its temporary monopoly. Roscosmos, Russia's space agency, used to charge NASA as little as $21.8 million per seat in 2008 (when the space shuttle was still around). By 2018, however, it intends to charge NASA $81 million per seat by 2018 — a cost increase of 372% over 10 years: How much NASA is paying Russia for each US astronaut seat aboard a Soyuz spacecraft from 2006 through 2018. Skye Gould/Business Insider The latest NASA OIG audit — coincidentally released the morning that SpaceX's uncrewed Falcon 9 rocket exploded on a launch pad during a routine test (no one was harmed, but Facebook's first satellite was destroyed) — follows up on a report it released in November 2013. The new audit finds that the delays by SpaceX and Boeing is going to cost NASA dearly in payments to Roscosmos. "Had the Agency met its original goal of securing commercial crew transportation by calendar year 2015, NASA could have avoided paying Russia close to $1 billion for Soyuz seats in 2017 and 2018, even factoring in the purchase of some seats in 2016 to cover the expected transition period," the OIG report states. The chart below factors in the price of a seat and the number of astronauts that NASA plans to launch (about six per year), to show how much NASA has paid Russia and could end up paying. The total cost over 12 years is more than $3.36 billion. Assuming NASA's budget remains roughly $18.5 billion a year, that means about 3% of the agency's funding could be diverted to Russia in 2018: How much NASA will pay Russia to send US astronauts into space from 2006 through 2018. Skye Gould/Business Insider A presentation given by a NASA official in May 2016 estimates the cost of each seat aboard SpaceX's Dragon spacecraft and Boeing's CST-100 Starliner spacecraft will be $58 million. The audit makes clear that any other hiccups in the NASA's commercial crew program, which could earn Boeing and SpaceX up to $4.2 billion and $2.6 billion (respectively) for their services, will be costly.

Kevork Djansezian/Getty Images "Given the delays in initiating a U.S. capacity to transport crew to the ISS, NASA has extended its contract with the Russian Space Agency for astronaut transportation through 2018 at an additional cost of $490 million," the report stated. "If the Commercial Crew Program experiences additional delays, NASA may need to buy additional seats from Russia to ensure a continued U.S. presence on the ISS." A response to the OIG findings in the report, penned by William Gerstenmaier — NASA's associate administrator for human exploration — agreed with the report's overall findings. Yet Gerstenmaier emphasized the importance of making sure commercial spacecraft are safe to fly. "Excessive focus on timeliness and schedule can result in reducing the overall safety of the system," Gerstenmaier wrote. "Timeliness must not be over stressed[.]" Business Insider contacted Boeing and SpaceX about the new OIG report. Although SpaceX did not immediately respond, Boeing issued the following statement to Business Insider: "We continue to work toward achieving certification and providing safe crew transportation services to and from the International Space Station with the first launch (orbital flight test) expected in 2017. As in any development program, issues can stress the schedule and we are working shoulder-to-shoulder with NASA to overcome them. Boeing has been a partner with NASA on the Starliner system since 2010 and we’ve made significant progress on the maturity of our design." We also asked representatives at SpaceX if the company's Sept. 1 Falcon 9 explosion could affect the company's rocket launch schedule and human spaceflight plans, and they told us by email: "[O]ur number one priority is to safely and reliably return to flight for our customers, as well as to take all the necessary steps to ensure the highest possible levels of safety for future crewed missions with the Falcon 9. We will carefully and thoroughly investigate and address this issue." A NASA spokesperson told Business Insider by email (our emphasis added in bold): "NASA remains confident in our commercial partners and in the goals of the Commercial Crew Program to take astronauts to and from low-Earth orbit. It is too early to know whether Thursday's incident will impact their development schedules. Spacecraft and launch vehicles designed for the Commercial Crew Program must meet NASA's stringent safety criteria before being certified to launch crews into space. Successfully meeting those requirements has always taken precedence over schedule."

 NASA is paying Russia more than $70 million to bring an astronaut home in this spaceship tonight Dave Mosher and Skye Gould Sep. 6, 2016, 3:36 PM 6,222 facebook linkedin twitter email print A three-module Soyuz spacecraft. NASA Tonight three people who have spent 172 days in orbit above the Earth will attempt to return home. But they won't be riding in a US spacecraft. NASA retired its space shuttle fleet in 2011. Meanwhile, commercial carriers like SpaceX and Boeing are still building, testing, and certifying their spaceships, respectively called Dragon and CST-100 Starliner. Today only one spaceship can launch people more than 200 miles above Earth, drop them off at the International Space Station (ISS), and fly them back: a Russian spacecraft called the Soyuz, which first launched in 1966 and means "union" in Russian. Though Russia's space agency, Roscosmos, has upgraded the three-module Soyuz design several times over the decades, it has hardly changed its core layout. What it charges other space agencies per seat, however, has changed dramatically in recent years. Below is a chart that shows what Russia has historically charged NASA per Soyuz spot since 2006, plus what it plans to charge in the near future, according to a new report that NASA's Office of Inspector General (OIG) released on Thursday, Sept. 1, 2016: How much NASA is paying Russia for each US astronaut seat aboard a Soyuz spacecraft from 2006 through 2018. Skye Gould/Business Insider The cheapest Soyuz seats NASA ever paid for were $21.8 million in 2007 and 2008. As soon as the space agency permanently grounded its space shuttles, though, Russia sharply raised the cost per seat. And it shows no signs of stopping while NASA, JAXA, and the European Space Agency wait for other options. By 2018, NASA and its partners will have to pay roughly $81 million per person to ride a Soyuz to the ISS and back again — a cost increase of 372% in 10 years. (The total cost to NASA over 12 years will be about $3.37 billion.) That contrasts to the $58 million NASA expects to pay per seat aboard SpaceX's and Boeing's ships, or roughly $214 million per space shuttle passenger. (Both numbers account for total lifetime costs of each spacecraft's development.) What will $81 million get you on a Soyuz? One of the safest trips to space, yet cramped between avionics and bags of cargo — for anywhere from 6 hours to 2 days per leg of the journey: Astronauts and a cosmonaut buckled into a cramped Soyuz descent module make for a very tight fit.. ESA/NASA Companies like Space Adventures have also purchased Soyuz seats in the past, sending mega-millionaires like videogame developer Richard Garriott up to the ISS. But the space outfitter's next mission is far more ambitious: It intends to recreate the Apollo 8 mission of 1968 and launch a lucky passenger (and two cosmonaut accomplices) around the moon. At $150 million per seat per lunar trip, it's starting to sound like a bargain.

Bill McGee, Special for USA TODAY 7:33 a.m. EDT September 7, 2016 Skip Ad Ad Loading... x Embed x Share Tom Hanks stars as Chesley Sullenberger, the pilot who safely landed his plane in the Hudson River, saving the lives of 155 crew and passengers. Passengers are evacuated after Delta Flight 1086 skidded off the runway at LaGuardia Airport during a snowstorm on March 5, 2015, in New York. (Photo: Larry Donnell, AP) The images eerily blur together. The latest appeared in August, this time with Emirates Flight 521 in Dubai. But they resembled British Airways Flight 2276 in Las Vegas and Delta Flight 1086 in New York, both in 2015. Ditto Asiana Flight 214 in San Francisco in 2013. And Cathay Pacific Flight 365 in Shanghai in 2011. Those inexplicable photos of passengers fleeing for their lives from smoking and even burning aircraft — while clutching carry-ons and shoulder bags, or maneuvering wheelies down evacuation slides. Such behavior is breathtakingly bizarre, considering that surviving some types of airline accidents has become statistically more common, as the new film Sully makes apparent. In fact, in an exhaustive study of domestic airline accidents over 17 years, the NTSB found 95.7% of occupants survived. But what a hollow victory that so many spectacular aeronautical advancements have reduced deaths due to impact and smoke inhalation and fire — yet you still may succumb anyway, because your seatmate is struggling to retrieve a laptop. Difficulty understanding Over the years I’ve written extensively about airline safety, including best practices for how to enhance your personal safety margins, as well as properly securing infants. But amid all the hotly contested comments, I can’t ever recall a human factors equation defying all logic. Some have suggested these incidents are due to language or cultural barriers, but they’re occurring everywhere. It’s best summed up by Sara Nelson, president of the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA: “Passengers stopping to grab their bags during an evacuation can be a matter of life and death for themselves and others around them. Flight attendants are trained to evacuate a plane in 90 seconds or less. Every second counts.” Recently I ranted about wheelie-dragging survivors to a close friend and was stunned by the response: “You’re making too much of it. It only takes A FEW SECONDS to get your carry-on. What’s the big deal?” And that’s when it hit me. Otherwise intelligent, sensible folks offer the “few seconds” argument without fully understanding just how precious such seconds are. Make no mistake: In aviation, life and death come down to nanoseconds. I spent months researching accident survival for my book Attention All Passengers, and discussed it in-depth with experts at the NTSB in Washington and Boeing in Seattle. Boeing employs a three-pronged approach to saving lives: surviving accidents, surviving post-crash fires, and safely evacuating. The most significant technological improvements over time may not seem momentous, but in this life-and-death struggle for that precious 90-second benchmark, such milestones include: • “low heat and smoke release” cabin materials • fire-resistant seat cushions • improved cabin insulation • floor path emergency lighting Technology has become predictable. Human behavior? That’s another matter. Human factors The carry-on conundrum is not a new phenomenon. Back in 2000, the National Transportation Safety Board released a Safety Study that examined 46 real-world evacuations over two years. It cited what 24 of 36 flight attendants found: “Passengers exiting with carry-on baggage were the most frequently cited obstruction to evacuation.” These real-world events included passengers evacuating with guitars, crutches and cases, as well as numerous accounts of heated arguments with flight attendants, blocked exits and minor injuries. Testimony included “waiting behind a passenger trying to maneuver a garment bag through an overwing exit.” Several significant factors have greatly exacerbated such problems: • The percentage of carry-on versus checked bags has soared since the widespread introduction of baggage fees in the late 2000s • Domestic airline cabins have become much fuller, with average load factors increasing from 72.4% in 2000 to 83.8% last year, while industry seat pitch became tighter • Electronic device usage has skyrocketed; a 2015 Pew Research Center study found 68% of U.S. adults carry smartphones and 45% carry tablets Blocking a row or aisle to collect belongings also can foment panic, which can be deadly during emergencies. Furthermore, each exit has been tested for a maximum number of passengers, but this assumes EVERY exit is properly working and not blocked; a decade ago the NTSB found slides failed in one-third of evacuations. And in 2005 Flight Safety Foundation reported the fatality rate with slide problems is 1.7 times higher than without such problems. There’s another overlooked factor: the danger in sending projectiles down a slide, potentially injuring others and/or damaging the slide itself. While working for airlines, I underwent egress training because I rode in cockpit jumpseats on charter and military flights; I recall a colleague breaking her ankle descending the slide. Consider that — a trained airline employee, supervised by safety experts, was still injured under the best of conditions. Yet some choose to descend in smoke, fire and adverse weather clutching a 50-pound bag? Research cites passengers retrieving items like wallets and medication when evacuating; it’s understandable, but hardly worth human lives. When I researched aerophobia I learned fear causes time to slow down for some passengers, so I contacted an expert, Dr. Mitchell Schare, director of the Phobia & Trauma Clinic at Hofstra University. He rejected this as a likely cause, and instead cited the “Beverly Hills Supper Club” syndrome, when people took cues from others and remained seated during a raging fire. Schare stated: “If the person next to you thinks it’s important to get their carry-on, then maybe you should. Before you know it, everybody’s engaging in the same foolish behavior.” Seeking solutions The NTSB found carry-ons were a “serious risk” and in 2000 recommended the Federal Aviation Administration “should develop advisory material to address ways to minimize the problems associated with carry-on luggage during evacuations.” Since then, this problem has grown worse, and aviation experts and airline blogs are weighing in with potential solutions, including: • Briefing cards. The NTSB found many (but not all) U.S. carriers recommend leaving behind personal items on safety briefing cards. But how many passengers actually review such cards? • Oral briefings. During safety briefings, some domestic carriers include warnings about leaving belongings, and some don’t. I asked the FAA for clarification and received this statement: “It is standard industry practice for U.S. airlines to use the pre-flight safety briefing to tell passengers to leave baggage and personal belongings behind during an evacuation.” But “standard industry practice” isn’t a regulation. As for flight attendant training, best practices recommend crews command passengers, “Leave everything!” But for many passengers, this is their first warning about abandoning items — and it comes at the worst possible time. Interestingly, Schare believes there’s sound psychological benefit in improving safety briefings: “People need ‘leaders’ to [advise them] during a crisis ... passengers should be told this philosophy.” • Penalizing passengers. The NTSB found flight attendant training doesn’t address “when passengers do not follow the command to leave everything behind.” AFA-CWA’s Nelson suggests, “Enforcement of fines associated with failing to comply with crewmember instructions may cause people to think twice.” Such enforcement would come from the FAA; if you search its site, you’ll find the agency does offer this advice: “If an emergency evacuation is necessary, leave your carry-on items on the plane. Retrieving personal items may impede the safe evacuation of passengers.” The FAA told me: “We expect passengers to pay attention to the safety briefing and follow their crew’s instructions to safely and quickly evacuate.” As for penalizing passengers, the FAA responded: “We have not fined anyone for taking bags with them in an emergency.” • Locking bins. Some believe crewmembers should automatically lock overhead bins upon activation of either seat belt or emergency floor path lighting. John Goglia, a former board member of the NTSB, recently wrote about this and warned of unintended consequences, particularly if a fire source is a computer or cellphone INSIDE a bin. Others note emergency equipment is sometimes stored in bins. And there’s little doubt the airlines will raise another factor — the potential costs of installing locks. That said, the FAA advised me: “We have no plans to lock the overhead.” Remember ... The NTSB estimates evacuations occur on U.S. aircraft once every 11 days on average. Until the FAA and airlines find solutions, you’ll need to protect yourself and loved ones. Consider the following: • Pay attention during the safety briefing (yes, even platinum frequent fliers). You HAVEN’T heard it all before, since you probably haven’t sat in that identical seat before, so your egress path is different. And count the rows to your nearest exit (there may be darkness or smoke). • Avoid shoes that fall off easily (flip-flops) and heels that are too high or spikey. Wear cotton or wool. • Stay buckled up, especially when instructed. Keep a clear path to the aisle. • The International Air Transport Association offers specific advice for evacuating with infants. • ALWAYS — follow all instructions from crewmembers! Survivability is far from certain if human error hinders safe egress. So one thing is certain. Until common sense becomes more common, you’d better hope such passengers aren’t seated next to an emergency exit.

Russian MiGs and SUs: 4th Gen Planes to Remain USAF's Workhorse © Flickr/ awee_19 Military & Intelligence 21:52 06.09.2016(updated 01:16 07.09.2016) Get short URL 127799184 Last week, looking to upgrade the USAF's fleet, the DoD confirmed that it would spend $12 billion to upgrade its 1970s-vintage F-15 Eagle fighters, cancelling earlier plans to equip the Air Force with newer F-22s. For their part, Russian experts have said, without any irony, that this may be the smartest move the Pentagon has made in recent years. Speaking to CNN last week, an Air Force representative said that the $12 billion upgrade to the F-15 4th generation air superiority fighters would cover 435 machines, equipping them with new radar, upgraded mission computers, advanced infrared search and track capabilities, electronic warfare defenses, and modernized communications, allowing them to work in coordination with other, more advanced aircraft. Some of the aircraft will also see their missile capacity doubled from 8 to 16, according to Boeing. Originally, the USAF's entire fleet of aging F-15s was meant to be scrapped, replaced by the 5th generation F-22 Raptor, which went into production in 2005. However, production of that aircraft was halted in 2009, with only 188 of the planned 749 F-22s produced. © REUTERS/ Master Sgt. Kevin J. Gruenwald Two US Air Force F-22 Raptor stealth jet fighters fly near Andersen Air Force Base, Guam. File photo © Sputnik/ Maxim Blinov Ready for Takeoff: India's First Helicopter in Years Performs Test FlightAs for the upgraded F-15s, their service life will be extended until 2040. The upgrades will take place between 2024 and 2030. According to Defense News, the US now has a total of 1,971 fighter and attack aircraft (including the A-10, F-15, F-16, F-22 and F-35A), but needs at least 1,900, including training and reserve aircraft. Recently, the Pentagon has also voiced concerns about the reduction in the number of fighters in the Air Force's fleet, with retiring aircraft not finding appropriate replacements, from the F-22, whose production has stopped, to the F-35, which is behind schedule by 6 years. Commenting on the Defense Department's decision to upgrade the new planes, Russian military experts speaking to the independent online newspaper Svobodnaya Pressa admitted that the DoD's decision, while forced, may have actually led them to stumble onto the best possible option. © AP Photo/ Greg Baker U.S. Air Force F-22 Raptors, right, and two F-15 Eagles prepare for take-off at Kadena Air Base on the southern island of Okinawa, in Japan (File) The F-15, the paper recalled, "was the first 4th generation fighter aircraft to enter service in the US Air Force…The aircraft has seen two modernization efforts through the first several decades of its operation, resulting in the modifications F15C and F-15E (the latter carrying tactical nukes). These planes were in turn upgraded in 2007; like today, the decision was motivated at the time by delays in the F-35 program. Since then, as we have seen, not much has changed. USAF Command announced the readiness of the first batch of its fifth gen F-35 Lightening II only last month." Therefore, Svobodnaya Pressa noted, "the question arises: to what degree will the [upgraded] F-15s be able to comply with the requirements of modern air combat between 2024 and 2040? And will they be able to match Russia's air forces?" © REUTERS/ Ministry of Defence of the Russian Federation Chances High That Russia Will Resume Its Use of Iranian Military Base, Expert Tells SputnikFor answers to this question, the paper turned to several military experts, including Lieutenant-General Valery Gorbenko, former commander of the Fourth Air Army. Russia's Mig-29, Gorbenko recalled, was initially designed in response to the F-16 Fighting Falcon, while the Su-27 was designed to take on the F-15. "But if we analyze the findings of foreign experts, we can conclude that modernized combat platform of a 3rd generation aircraft has a combat effectiveness that is nearly as good as a non-upgraded 4th generation plane. That is, the radar field of more modern fighters can be easily be broken by fighters from earlier generations equipped with modern radar, electronic warfare systems, etc." © Photo: Sukhoi Company Russia's Su-27, designed as a counterweight to the F-15. Accordingly, Gorbenko noted, since the F-15 has "a good engine and airframe, in the future it can receive upgraded avionics and weapons systems whose production is not even at the planning stages today." Ultimately, the officer emphasized that "an aircraft's airframe can last for a very long time; the problem is always rooted either in the engine or in the internals. But if engine life allows it, the installation of new electronics can make for a relatively modern aircraft. In air combat, the airframe generally plays an indirect role; the main thing is for the aircraft to detect [enemy] planes at long range, to track them and attack." © Photo: Youtube/defenseupdate US Air Force to Acquire 250 Next Generation Air-Launched, Precision Glide BombsFor his part, retired Air Force colonel Vladimir Karyakin, a lecturer at the Military University of the Russian Ministry of Defense, recalled that information has been publicized suggesting that the F-15's modernization will include a new radar with active electronic scanned array (AESA), the Eagle Passive Active Warning Survivability System (EPAWSS) early warning system, developed by Bae Systems, a long range infrared search and tracking system, and the Talon HATE communications system, allowing it to communicate securely with the F-22. Furthermore, reports have spread that the upgraded plane will have increased ammunition and fuel capacity. Accordingly, Karyakin noted, making prudent upgrades to existing planes is definitely a better strategy than creating extravagent new ones. "The modernization of time-tested and proven aircraft is an American trend. For example, in 2015, the Pentagon announced the return of the supersonic B-1B Lancer bomber to the USAF's Global Command. And Boeing has received an order to further modernize not just the B-1Bs (which entered service in the USAF in 1985) but also the B-52 strategic bombers (which have been serving since 1955), to bring them into compliance with the 'digital age'." © AFP 2016/ HO/USAF B-2 Spirit (bottom) bomber flying with B-1B (C) and B-52 bombers at an undisclosed location over Afghanistan, file photo. Therefore, the retired Russian colonel explained, "the modernization of the 4th gen fighter is a reasonable approach to operating the USAF's fleet; and it's not just about the price, or problems with 5th gen planes. As practice has shown, it's not so simple to transplant flight crew to new types of aircraft. According to some estimates, doing so results in a 40% loss in combat effectiveness until pilots can get used to their new vehicles." © AP Photo/ Xinhua Beijing Develops New Long Range Bomber as Part of ‘Transformation’ ProcessAccording to Karyakin, particularly in high-intensity conflicts, "the number of aircraft that can be raised into the air plays a crucial role." Therefore, the logic that 'quantity has a quality all its own' definitely holds true, even in modern warfare. "There are even signs that USAF command is interested in equipping its 4th and 5th generation F-15s and F-22s with flights of drones. In this way, the combat capabilities of the machines would increase further." Meanwhile, Andrei Frolov, editor in chief of Russia's Arms Export Magazine, also suggested that upgrading the USAF's fleet of F-15Cs would be a prudent move, since replacing its fleet of these aircraft with 5th gen planes would effectively bankrupt the country's budget. "This is especially so given that in some combat scenarios, F-22s and F-35s are simply overkill – for example, in instances of establishing air superiority in countries which do not have well-developed air and air defense systems." Moreover, according to Frolov, the upgraded F-15s are will be more than capable of fulfilling the duty of defending America's administrative and economic infrastructure inside the country's borders. © Photo: Youtube / Alexander Ermakov Production of the US's F-35, which analysts have criticized for being behind schedule and overpriced. Finally, retired colonel Mikhail Khodarenok, former chief of the 1st Main Operations Directorate of the Russian General Staff, emphasized that he believed the Pentagon's decision on the F-15s was based in part on the fact that Russian radar technology has effectively rendered America's 'stealth' efforts obsolete. © Flickr/ Gonzalo Alonso I See You: Russian-Made Sunflower Radar is Capable of Detecting F-35 Jets"The F-22 and F-35 have proven themselves to be too expensive, with their effectiveness in real combat questionable, because their bets on decreased radar visibility have proven unjustified," Khodarenok explained. "It's true that in the S-band, the reflective surface of the F-117A Nighthawk was very sharply reduced. But it remains well-visible by radars in the VHF band, which is the backbone of the equipment used by Russia's radio-radar troops. Meanwhile, even visibility in the S-band means that the 'stealth' aircraft can be fired at and destroyed." "Therefore, if the airframe and engine allow it, the modernization of the F-15 is probably justified. In modern air combat, the result is decided by the plane's onboard avionics equipment," the officer concluded. ...

Image: Big Imagination Foundation/Facebook Check Your Baggage and Hop On Burning Man's Airplane Art Car Written by Madison Margolin Contributor September 6, 2016 // 02:06 PM EST Copy This URL Aside from being a weird, wild temporary desert community, Burning Man has also come to be a petri dish for some of the most innovative and eclectic pieces of art and tech. Art cars roam the playa as Burners hop on board to dance. This year, one group took their art car to the next level by putting a Boeing 747 jumbo jet on wheels. It took several months for the Big Imagination Foundation, a nonprofit organization that "incubates brave new ideas and talent," to hollow out a 1985 Boeing commercial plane to make space for art and dancing. Burners in the plane. Image: Big Imagination Foundation/Facebook The group calls their airplane art car "the largest moving art experience ever made." The upper deck was transformed into a open-air rooftop, and the plane's tail and side wings were removed altogether. The rows of seats was replaced with couches and lounge chairs. Weighing over 50 tons, the plane was pulled around the playa by an aircraft tug car. At Burning Man, the 747 was set up to feature daily talks from global thought leaders in the "First Class lounge" and special performances at night. When burners entered the plane as passengers, they were asked "What baggage do you need to lose?" and "Where are you going?" "Artistically, the 747 represents our journey through life toward one's future," the Big Imagination Foundation wrote on its website. "Where is it that you want to go? How do you want to make a difference? These are the questions we want people to ponder." Topics: burning man, art, 747, Boeing, Big Imagination Foundation Contact the author by Twitter.

Three types of cryogenic foam are under tests to assess how they insulate the SLS rocket’s core stage and launch vehicle stage adapter that links the core stage to the interim cryogenic propulsion stage, NASA said Saturday. The ICPS will work to thrust the Orion unmanned spacecraft beyond the moon prior to the vehicle’s return to Earth as part of the planned Exploration Mission-1 in 2018. “NASA has developed new, more environmentally friendly insulation materials for future launch vehicles,” said Michael Frazier, chief of the nonmetallic materials branch at NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center. “The cryoinsulation materials for SLS are not only more environmentally compliant, but they are also just as efficient and lightweight as the previous generation of materials,” added Frazier. The agency noted it uses the three types of foam to cover hundreds of 24-by-24-inch panels for various tests meant to qualify the insulation for the harsh conditions SLS will experience before and during flight. NASA expects to complete qualification testing of all the foam systems in late 2016.

"The Boeing 777-300 aircraft, registered as A6-EMW, was destroyed following the impact with the runway and the subsequent fire," the GCAA said in a press release, adding that the official copy of the preliminary report (AIFN/0008/2016) is available on its website. The preliminary report states that following an attempted go-around, the aircraft descended rapidly from a height of approximately 85 feet back onto the runway, sliding for approximately 800 metres before coming to rest. All of the 300 passengers and crew were evacuated from the aircraft safely before a fire consumed the cabin, it added. In accordance with international protocols of aircraft accident investigation, the preliminary report contains only factual information related to the accident and contains no analysis, or conclusions. The final report, which will be issued at the conclusion of the investigation, will contain analysis of the facts, and conclusions. The analysis aims to identify the cause(s) and the factors that contributed to the accident, the GCAA said. The investigation team is led by the AAIS investigator-in-charge, IIC, and comprises the accredited representatives of the states of manufacture of the aircraft (United States) and the engines (United Kingdom). In addition, technical representatives of Boeing, Rolls-Royce and Emirates Airline have been assigned roles as advisers to the IIC and the accredited representatives. The Director-General of the GCAA, Saif Mohammed Al Suwaidi, said, "During the course of rescue and firefighting, an explosion occurred which resulted in the tragic death of a firefighter. We extend our deepest sympathy to the family of the deceased, and at the same time we hope that the grief of his family is made more bearable by the knowledge that his courageous behaviour helped to ensure the survival of all the people on board the flight." The Assistant Director-General of the AAIS, Ismaeil Al Hosani, said, "The investigation team is continuing to examine the aircraft and flight data. Analysis of the data extracted from the flight recorders is ongoing to determine the technical performance of the aircraft and systems, and crew control inputs and performance. In-depth analysis will be carried out to examine the operator’s policies and procedures for such flight conditions."

travel Emirates airline jet touched down before runway impact last Aug- report by Derek Baldwin, Chief Reporter 06 September, 2016 Preliminary investigation reveals 'strange' wind conditions moments before the Boeing 777 impacted the runway 06 September 2016 Dubai: A preliminary investigation report by the UAE's federal aviation authority into last month's Emirates Boeing 777-31H accident with 300 people on board said the pilot attempted to abort the landing after the wheels had already touched down. The passenger jet then lifted off again for a "go-around" but within seconds lost altitude and then impacted the runway as the wheels were retracting back into the undercarriage of the fuselage, said the report on the August 3 accident. Despite the plane catching fire as it slid on its belly along Runway 12L at Dubai International Airport, 282 passengers and 18 crew aboard flight EK521 from Thiruvananthapuram, India were evacuated safely. The report dated September 5 by the GCAA (General Civil Aviation Authority) said early investigation revealed there were wind changes in the moments of final approach before the plane impacted the runway. "Approach controller and the WM [watch manager] remarked on these wind conditions as being strange," the report stated. Flight environment "During the landing and attempted go-around, the aircraft was in a rapidly changing and dynamic flight environment. The initial touchdown and transition of the aircraft from air to ground mode, followed by the lift-off and the changes in the aircraft configuration in the attempted go-around, involved operational modes, logics and inhibits of a number of systems, including the autothrottle, the air/ground system, the weather radar, and the GPWS. The characteristics of these systems, and others, will be examined during the course of the investigation." According to the report, the 34-year-old commander flying the plane was an experienced pilot with almost 7,500 flying hours in total and more than 5,000 flying hours on the Boeing 777 aircraft type involved in the incident. Advertisement "Post-accident blood tests did not reveal psychoactive materials that could have degraded the crew performance," the report said. The GCAA report confirmed that "21 passengers, one flight crewmember, and one cabin crewmember sustained minor injuries, and a second cabin crewmember sustained a serious injury. Approximately nine minutes after the aircraft came to rest, a firefighter was fatally injured as a result of the explosion of the centre fuel tank." The initial report stems from the formation of a team by the GCAA assisted by Emirates, Boeing and engine maker Rolls Royce. In its initial report in a full investigation expected to take from three to five months, the report stated that after the aborted landing, the "aircraft reached a maximum height of approximately 85 feet RA at 134 knots IAS, with the landing gear in transit to the retracted position. The aircraft then began to sink back onto the runway. Both crewmembers recalled seeing the IAS decreasing and the Copilot called out 'Check speed'. At 0837:35, three seconds before impact with the runway, both thrust levers were moved from the idle position to full forward. The autothrottle transitioned from idle to thrust mode. Approximately one second later, a ground proximity warning system (GPWS) aural warning of 'Don't sink, don't sink' was annunciated," the report said. "One second before impact, both engines started to respond to the thrust lever movement showing an increase in related parameters. At 0837:38, the aircraft aft fuselage impacted the runway abeam the November 7 intersection at 125 knots, with a nose-up pitch angle of 9.5 degrees, and at a rate of descent of 900 feet per minute. This was followed by the impact of the engines on the runway. The three landing gears were still in transit to the retracted position." The accident marks the first time in Emirates' 31-year history that the airline suffered irreparable damage to one of its aircraft. Emirates welcomes report In a statement to Gulf News on Tuesday, Emirates said it "welcomes the publication of the preliminary report by the United Arab Emirates (UAE) General Civil Aviation Authority Air Accident Investigations Sector (GCAA- AAIS) on the accident involving flight EK521 on 3 August 2016. As this is a Preliminary Report based on the facts gathered so far during the on-going investigation, it does not cover causes of the accident nor does it make final safety recommendations. We will review the report carefully." A spokesperson said: "Emirates is also conducting its own rigorous internal investigation to proactively review what we know about the accident, and consider measures that may enhance our operations or procedures. We would like to take this opportunity to thank the investigating authorities for their continued commitment to the investigation of this accident. Emirates will continue to extend our full co-operation as they work towards the Final Report." Report highlights * After the aircraft came to rest, fire was emanating from the No. 2 engine, the damaged RH engine-pylon wing attachment area and from under the aircraft fuselage. Approximately one minute after, the commander transmitted a "Mayday" call and informed air traffic control that the aircraft was being evacuated. * Apart from the Commander and the senior cabin crewmember, who both jumped from the L1 door onto the detached slide, crewmembers and passengers evacuated the aircraft using the escape slides. When the aircraft impacted and slid along the runway, passengers started to unfasten their seatbelts and stand up. An announcement was made for the passengers to remain seated. When the Aircraft came to rest, some passengers were screaming, grabbing their belongings, and asking the cabin crewmembers to open the doors. The cabin crewmembers followed the operator's safety instructions that prohibit passengers taking their carry-on baggage during an evacuation, and they instructed the passengers to leave their bags behind. However, several passengers evacuated the aircraft carrying their baggage.

(NYSE: LLL) is well positioned to see a rebound in its below-average sales growth and margins, given the improving defense environment. Gursky initiated coverage of the company with a Buy rating and price target of $174. “Our price target assumes a discount vs. larger peers given the show-me nature of the story, which could create further upside if the strengthened management team is able to deliver on its targets,” the analyst mentioned. Gursky noted that L-3 Communications has been deploying capital to drive earnings growth via repo and M&A. Driving Earnings On the other hand, the stabilizing defense market, which accounts for 70 percent of the company’s sales, as well as the strong commercial aviation demand indicate that sales would bottom in 2016. “All three of the company’s segments should return to growth in 2017E via a combination of new work & easing international comps,” Gursky believes, expecting growth to reach 3.5 percent into 2018. The analyst also believes these improving trends would help L-3 Communications to narrow some of its historical valuation discount to peers, who seem poised to achieve similar growth. “The company is targeting sustainable low-teen margins over time which, if achieved, should go a long way in improving the valuation outlook for the company as peers already perform at those levels,” Gursky pointed out.

LATEST VIDEOS More Videos: Rates from Bankrate.com Mortgage Credit Cards Auto Halt and catch fire: Battery woes go well beyond Samsung 09/06/2016 - 2:00 AM EDT NEW YORK >> Samsung's Note 7 isn't the only gadget to catch fire thanks to lithium-battery problems, which have afflicted everything from iPhones to Tesla cars to Boeing jetliners. Blame chemistry and the fact that the batteries we rely on for everyday life are prone to leaking and even bursting into flame if damaged, defective or exposed to excessive heat. That's because lithium-ion batteries store a lot of energy in a tiny space, with combustible components separated by ultra-thin walls. If something happens to those separators, a chemical reaction can quickly escalate out of control. Samsung hasn't specified exactly what caused the fires that led to the recall of 2.5 million Galaxy Note 7s Thursday beyond calling it a #x201c;battery cell issue .#x201d; More Headlines Legoland attraction to debut in spring at Plymouth Meeting Mall US retail sales jump 0.8 pct. in sign of consumer health Ho, ho, hold up before you spend this season Region's businesses urged to fight data breaches US stocks finish level as tech losses cancel out bank gains Still, lithium batteries are so ubiquitous that ordinary users of phones and computers shouldn't worry. Research suggests that you're more likely to get hurt by a kitchen grease fire or a drunk driver than the battery powering your iPhone, Kindle or laptop. #x201c;It's not like we live in a world where people's smartphones spontaneously combust,#x201d; said Ramon Llamas, research manager of research firm IDC's mobile phones team. He said owners of Galaxy Note 7s should err on the side of caution and contact Samsung for a replacement that doesn't run the same risk. Here's a look at other notable incidents when lithium batteries by themselves or in electronics have caused problems. ON AIRPLANES There have been dozens of aircraft fires caused by lithium batteries, so many that the batteries are no longer welcome as cargo on passenger flights. In one of the most recent incidents, a Fiji Airways Boeing 737 was preparing for takeoff from Melbourne, Australia, when smoke was discovered coming from the cargo bay. The plane was evacuated and the cargo unloaded. The source of the fire turned out to be lithium-ion batteries in a passenger's checked bags. Hoverboards and e-cigarettes are banned from flights for the same reason. TESLA In August, a Tesla electric car caught fire during a promotional tour in southwest France. Tesla said in a statement that it is #x201c;working with the authorities to establish the facts#x201d; about the fire. The driver was quoted in local newspaper Sud Ouest as saying he answered a Facebook ad offering test drives of the Model S sedan. The driver said he saw smoke, and the three people aboard got out before seeing it catch fire. Tesla hasn't officially found fault with the battery. But in 2013 , it faced questions when several Model S sedans caught fire after road debris damaged their batteries. Tesla wound up strengthening the battery shield on new and existing cars. HOVERBOARDS Hoverboards, or self-balancing scooters, have been linked with at least 99 electrical fires in the U.S., according to the the Consumer Product Safety Commission. Hoverboards might be more susceptible than other products to battery fires because they come under more duress than other electronic devices like computers. Amazon, Best Buy and other retailers dumped the products after videos of burning hoverboards went viral. But they reopened sales this year after passing new fire-safety tests. 1 2 next  last »

From producing a single canvas-and-wood airplane to transforming how we fly over oceans and on to the stars, The Boeing Company has become the world’s largest aerospace company. Over the last 100 years, Boeing has created an inspiring legacy of innovation — one that has defended freedom for millions and propelled people across previously un-traversed skies and even beyond into space. Our relationship with Oman and the Middle East is equally historic and in tune with the region’s vision for an innovative future. For example, our partnership with Oman Air dates back 15 years during which time the airline has been operating the 737 family. The airline’s fleet will be enhanced by an order of 20 737 MAXs, which build on the Next-Generation 737’s reliability, delivering customers unsurpassed fuel efficiency in the single-aisle market. We are also delighted to introduce our industry-leading twin-aisle airplanes into its growing fleet with the delivery of two of the six 787 Dreamliners that Oman Air ordered in 2011. Since 1945, when US President Franklin D Roosevelt presented a DC-3 Dakota to Saudi Arabia, our relationship with the Middle East has continued to deepen and strengthen as we support the region’s burgeoning requirement for commercial airplanes as one of the world’s fastest growing commercial airplane markets. Like the region’s visionary leaders, we look beyond the present and to a future in which the Middle East will create innovations that impact the entire world. There is a desire and hunger for disruptive technology and creativity in the region and Boeing is well placed to support an innovative Middle East. Today, at the start of our second century, it’s on us to imagine what comes next and make it happen. In the next 100 years we may be living off unlimited clean power from solar satellites, making daily commercial trips to space or flying across the globe in less than an hour. It’s not enough to have a great legacy, we are founders of our future. To facilitate this change, Boeing believes that inspiring the region’s next generation of young people who will imagine the future is imperative and we have invested heavily in creating a suite of educational Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) content to share with the region’s future “doers”. One of the centerpieces of our Centennial celebrations is the Above and Beyond exhibition. The exhibit, which has so far toured Dubai and Abu Dhabi and will visit Saudi Arabia, offers hands-on experience with aerospace innovations past, present and future. Our challenge as with many other companies and countries is to create and maintain a fertile environment for new ideas, where people want to do things that haven’t been done before or do things better. Looking to the future, we see space exploration as an important frontier for Boeing and we believe it will be an important frontier for the Middle East. Boeing is a strong supporter of growing the space sector. We see a great opportunity for us to partner with the region on future endeavours that will shape the future of humankind. Boeing has a strong pedigree in space exploration. With the International Space Station (ISS), we have just completed 15 years of continuous human presence in low Earth orbit, and our analysis will enable the extension of a unique micro-gravity laboratory to exist on board the station until at least 2028. Meanwhile, as part of our Commercial Crew programme, Boeing is on track to conduct an un-crewed flight test in late-2017 and a crewed flight test in early-2018 leading to a first crewed mission in mid-2018. Boeing and Nasa are on the path to a 2018 first flight (EM-1), which will take an un-crewed Orion around the moon. The second mission (EM-2) with a larger upper stage will launch in 2021 with a crewed Orion co-manifested with the first element of the habitat that will be placed in the proximity of the moon. Of course, space is only one element of our strategy for innovation. Our research & technology teams ensure that the company is constantly focused on generating innovation and creativity while our technology investments focus on affordability, breakthrough performance, enduring sustainability and environmental responsibility. Research and innovation are a major part of our infrastructure; a framework that we believe can be transferred to the Middle East. 100 years after our founding, technology is advancing at ever-accelerating speeds, but the lesson of our founders still holds true: our company’s future depends on our ability to focus creativity and invention into practical and measurable value for our customers. As stewards of this history, we have a responsibility to build an even more inspiring future, and continue Bill Boeing’s legacy of applying innovation to solve problems and change the world and the Middle East. We enter our next century determined to make a difference and when others say it can’t be done; we will find a way. “It behooves no one to dismiss a novel idea with the statement: It can’t be done” — William E Boeing (The writer is President of Boeing —Middle East, North Africa and Turkey) About the author View all articles by Oman Observer ← Tencent now China’s most valuable firm Sweden’s Noren beats Hend in play-off → ← Previous Next → Search Recent Posts Recent Obama, EU leaders agree to stick together, stay tough on Russia Presidential hopefuls spar over Trump win Read More ...

Blasting News > News > 2016 > 09 > NASA OIG report suggests delays of commercial crew vehicles Published on: 7 September 2016 7 September 2016 Published on 07/09/2016 Mark Whittington - Expert in News M. Whittington Follow Following Rate the news NASA OIG report suggests delays of commercial crew vehicles Technical challenges beset the Boeing CST-100 and the SpaceX Dragon development programs Boeing CST-100 Starliner in orbit Advertisements In a report issued before the accident that destroyed a SpaceX Falcon 9 and its Israeli communications satellite payload, and trashed a launch pad, #NASA’s Office of the Inspector General (OIG) concluded that the first commercial crew flights would be delayed until at least late 2018. Both the #Boeing CST-100 Starliner and the #SpaceX Dragon are facing significant technical challenges that have to be overcome before the two spacecraft can fly crews to and from the International Space Station, according to Space News. Previous development delays could be ascribed to funding shortfalls. In this case, the delays are the result of the technical challenges that just about every space system is beset with during its development phase. Boeing is encountering problems in the mass growth of its spacecraft as well as “aeroacoustical loads” that would be inflicted on the Atlas V rocket during launch. SpaceX is experiencing a significant design change from a vehicle that lands on land to one that splashes down on water, much like the old Apollo spacecraft did. It is also having trouble with a number of subsystems, including the parachutes and a tunnel that allows crews to access the International Space Station. The report highlights one of the limitations of the commercial model for spaceflight. While commercial entities are undoubtedly more flexible than the bureaucratic bound NASA in developing space systems and therefore can accomplish the task cheaper. However, the inherent technical challenges of developing new space systems are the same, whether it takes place under the old NASA-centric system or the commercial system. Schedule slippages and even cost overruns are inevitable no matter which approach is used. Too many commercial space advocates have oversold the commercial model, claiming, to paraphrase an old axiom by Arthur C. Clarke, that any sufficiently commercial process is indistinguishable from magic. To be sure, the commercial model is the soundest approach to pursue in the long run since it should provide cost savings once new space systems become operational because of market competition. But problems, whether the ones uncovered by NASA’s OIG, or whatever caused the recent SpaceX Falcon 9, are inevitable and need to be worked through without resort to hype or magical thinking.   Advertisements Donald Trump to avoid Trump University fraud charges with multi-million dollar settlement Donald Trump makes his first cabinet nominations Declawing your cat may soon be a crime in some states Share Share comments comment 0 Share Rate the news   Advertisements Advertisements Most discussed news Trump selects Reince Priebus as Chief of Staff; Steve Bannon for Senior Advisor K.

The unmanned spacecraft, known as OSIRIS-REx, is poised to blast off at 7:05 pm (23:05 GMT) atop an Atlas V rocket in Cape Canaveral, Florida. The weather forecast is 90 percent favorable for liftoff. The $800 million mission will travel for two years on a journey to Bennu, a near-Earth asteroid about the size of a small mountain. The United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket with NASA's OSIRIS-REx spacecraft on board is rolls out of the Vertical Integration Facility to Space Launch Complex 41 on September 7, 2016 ©Joel Kowsky (NASA/AFP/File) Bennu was chosen from the some 500,000 asteroids in the solar system because it orbits close to Earth's path around the sun, it is the right size for scientific study, and it is one of the oldest asteroids known to NASA. "For primitive, carbon-rich asteroids like Bennu, materials are preserved from over four and a half billion years ago," explained Christina Richey, OSIRIS-REx deputy program scientist at NASA. These "may be the precursors to life in Earth or elsewhere in our solar system." OSIRIS-REx's main goal is to gather dirt and debris from the surface of the asteroid and return it to Earth by 2023 for further study. Learning more about the origins of life and the beginning of the solar system are key objectives for the SUV-sized OSIRIS-REx, which stands for Origins, Spectral Interpretation, Resource Identification and Security-Regolith Explorer. The mission should also shed light on how to find precious resources such as water and metals in asteroids, a field that has generated increasing interest worldwide. "We are going to map this brand-new world that we have never seen before," said Dante Lauretta, OSIRIS-REx principal investigator and professor at the University of Arizona, Tucson. Using a suite of cameras, lasers and spectrometers, "we are really going to understand the distribution of materials across the surface of that asteroid," he added. "We are a trailblazer for that kind of activity because our science requires it." The spacecraft is expected to reach Bennu in August 2018 and spend two years studying it before it begins the sample collection attempt in July 2020. - 'Gentle high five' - NASA hopes the solar-powered OSIRIS-REx will bring back the largest payload of space samples since the Apollo era of the 1960s and 1970s, when American explorers collected and carried back to Earth some 800 pounds (360 kilograms) of moon rocks. The collection device, known as the Touch-and-Go Sample Acquisition Mechanism (TAGSAM), should pick up about two ounces (60 grams) from the asteroid, but in tests so far it has generally picked up five times that amount. TAGSAM contains a type of reverse-vacuum mechanism that was invented by a Lockheed Martin engineer who tested the concept a decade ago using a red plastic Solo cup in his driveway. The spacecraft will not land on the asteroid, but will get very close and reach out with an arm like a pogo-stick for a quick, three-to-five second maneuver. Rich Kuhns, OSIRIS-REx program manager with Lockheed Martin Space Systems in Denver, described the movement as a "gentle high-five." The sample collector will shoot a bit of compressed air at the asteroid and gather the dust it kicks up in a container. "Three-quarters of the sample will be set aside for future researchers -- for the science questions we haven't figured out to even ask yet," said Gordon Johnston, an OSIRIS-REx program executive at NASA headquarters. NASA has also promised four percent of the sample to its major partner in the effort, Canada, and another half-percent to Japan. - Orbital nudges - Yet another aim of the mission is to measure how sunlight can nudge asteroids as they orbit, a phenomenon known as the Yarkovsky effect, so scientists can better predict the long-term risk of asteroids like Bennu colliding with Earth. In 2135, Bennu is expected to pass just slightly within the moon's orbit, a "particularly close approach (that) will change Bennu's orbit by a small amount, which is uncertain at this time and which may lead to a potential impact on Earth sometime between 2175 and 2199," NASA said. However, the risk of a collision during this 24-year period is low -- just 0.037 percent, or a one in 2,700 chance. - Past missions - It was the Japanese space agency JAXA that first proved sample collection from an asteroid was possible. JAXA's Hayabusa spacecraft crash-landed into the surface of its target asteroid and managed to return a few micrograms of material in 2010. In December 2014, JAXA launched a follow-on mission, Hayabusa 2, that should reach the asteroid Ryugu in 2018. The Hayabusa 2 spacecraft is supposed to place a small lander named Mascot on the space rock's surface, and return asteroid samples by 2020.

India’s next four Poseidon-8I long-range maritime surveillance and anti-submarine warfare aircraft could come fitted with domestically-made composite interior panels. Tata Advanced Materials Ltd (TAML), a subsidiary of Tata Industries, has been awarded a contract from Boeing to provide composite interior closeout panels for the P-8 aircraft that cover the interior wall structure of the aircraft, a statement from the Tatas said. The contract entails supplying interior panels on a global basis. However, industry sources said it is not clear if the Indian version of the aircraft would come fitted with TAML-made panels as they are not the sole providers. The P-8 is designed for long-range anti-submarine and anti-surface warfare as well as armed intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance missions. India had on July 27 signed an over $1-billion deal with American defence and aerospace major Boeing for procuring four additional Poseidon-8I. The contract is a follow-on order to eight P-81 planes already bought by India in a direct deal worth $2.1 billion with the firm.

RNP provides the aircraft with narrow three-dimensional paths into the vicinity of an airport, where the GBAS landing system (GLS) provides the precision guidance to landing. One of the key aims is for GLS to improve airport capacity and access during low visibility.

Podcast: Will Airplanes Ever Fly Themselves? Discuss this Gallery 10 JETTEPILOT on Sep 8, 2016 It has been interesting to follow the development of such procedures over the course of the last 40 years. It appears that it has finally all come together. In the late 70's we had early implementations (in Paris) of simply parallel approaches using ILS. In the early 80's development began on concepts for "data link" to improve the ability to navigate and surveil. I recall writing a paper in '81 describing closely-spaced parallel operations using the former Denver Stapleton as an example. One aircraft was to fly a 3.5 degree glideslope and use a displaced threshold. Eventually such a concept was implemented in Frankfurt. In the middle 80's the promise of the Microwave Landing system allowed experiments with curved or segmented approach paths and the ability to adjust GS angles. But, the promise of satellite based guidance delayed the widespread implementation of those concepts for about 15 years. With the improvements in GPS-based systems manufacturers and airlines were willing to incur the expenses associated with equipping their aircraft and the RNP programs began with incremental implementations of approach procedures using GPS-based navigation and improved data communication systems. If one compares the way aircraft navigated in 1976 (when i got my pilot's license) to what is being demonstrated at SFO it is indeed a revolution. Although, the fact it took 40 years for the technology, operational concepts, equipage, and certification to all come together makes it an evolution. Congratulations to everybody who moved the system forward over the last 40 years. Log In or Register to post comments cageordie on Sep 8, 2016 When I was at the Royal Aircraft Establishment (Bedford) in 1983 we had MADGE on the side of the main runway. The RN had deployed on carriers in 1976 and Shell had trialed on north sea oil platforms in the late 70s (they published in 1978) for digitally guided curved precision approaches. MLS had better marketing but never delivered on the promise despite being chosen by the ICAO in 1978. There were some claims that MADGE would not work on specific airfields, made by the MLS marketing people, that ICAO believed but were proved to be false. MADGE marketing people fought too fair. The BLEU developed the autoland systems used to this day from WWII technology and could have delivered blind precision curved approaches 40 years ago. They did for the RN and Shell. It isn't that the technology is not available. There are even uncertified systems which you can run on an iPad which will continuously compute power off approaches for your aircraft from its current position to the best available runway (it searches nearby airports to find which runways are in range and suitable for your landing performance), then all you have to do is fly through the boxes on the synthetic vision display and arrive at the runway. So much technology is available, just not on commercial aircraft. Log In or Register to post comments Mark Lincoln on Sep 8, 2016 It think Jettepilot is right. Diverse developments have come together with space based navigation aids presenting a revolutionary conclusion to an era of incremental development. Eighty years ago the Low Frequency Adcock Range system was just replacing a system if beacon lights spaced along the airways. As one station was located near an airport it was possible to use them for non-precision approaches. In Europe the Lorenz Beam landing system was developed and adapted by Deutsche Lufthansa. The somewhat similar Diamond-Dunmore system was developed by the Bureau of Standards. The USA didn't adapt it but France did. The US system eventually was developed into the CAA Instrument Landing System (ILS). After WW II it became a world standard. The immense deficiencies of the Low Frequency range was addressed by the VHF Omni Directional Radio Range. VOR required many more stations but it was not rendered useless by weather and could be used in 360° rather than just 4 directions. Add Distance Measuring Equipment (DME). Finally there was Autoland CAT II in 1972 and you have the world Jettepilot was introduced to. The whole time from earliest radio navigation systems c1919 to the combination of ILS and VOR in 1946 was one of fragmented developments. The period 1946 to Autoland CAT III in 1975 was a period of refinement and integration. What this article portends is an integrated system of navigation, air traffic control approach and landing with a fantastic possibility. All previous systems were dependent upon land based transmitters and therefore were to some, often a large degree limited in range and application. It is not mentioned in the brief article but I think the replacement of NDB approaches with a precision system available in every equipped aircraft world wide is more remarkable than more efficient use of major airport runways. Precision landings will need ground-based augmentation system but a precision approach should be available anywhere procedures have been established. Jettepilot is right, it is all coming together again and it looks to be great.

The history of navigation goes back to the Phoenicians, but I'm not quite that old to speak about it from personal experience. There is a great exhibit at the smithsonian on navigation, by-the-way, "Time and Navigation" that traces the last 300 years or so. The contents of the latest cockpits are in fact the results of some brilliant efforts by thousands of people over hundreds of years. Pilots are a fortunate group to be there to enjoy the accomplishments. ...Never in the course of history have so few owed so much to so many .

Log In or Register to post comments bucket on Sep 9, 2016 I am totally confused! What is a precision approach if it's not 3 dimensional? As long as an aeroplane is airborne, it is flying in a 3 dimensional environment. Log In or Register to post comments DTRT on Sep 9, 2016 bucket - yes, a precision approach via standard ILS is three dimensional guidance, just as is provided by an LPV GPS approach. The difference with the RNP approaches at airports like SFO is that they are not limited to approach fixes connected by straight line paths (both vertical and horizontal), but can also include curved approaches (again, both vertical curves and horizontal curves). Conceptually these RNP approaches in 3D space resemble a freeway ramp or flyover that has both horizontal and vertical parabolic curves, leading to the runway. The standard ILS or LPV approach would be more like a grid road layout, with straight lines between the intersections. This allows a more efficient, shorter approach path which in turn enables higher traffic loads at busy airports.

An aerial view of the campus on 66th Avenue West in Lynnwood, as it looks in 2016. As Edmonds Community College prepares to celebrate its 50th anniversary, President Dr. Jean Hernandez points to what she sees as the college’s greatest strength: its middle name. “I tell people that at Edmonds Community College, there’s a really strong sense of community,” said Hernandez, who has been at the helm of EdCC since 2011. “When I first got here I was really impressed with how many faculty and staff knew their students, knew them by name, knew their life stories. They cared about them.” Hernandez said she feels that same community connection as she travels throughout the college’s Snohomish County service area. (The Washington State Legislature established service areas for each of the state’s 34 community colleges, although students can attend any college depending on their educational needs.) Edmonds Community College President Dr. Jean Hernandez “I’ve met so may people who’ve gone to school here and many of them have just taken a couple of classes,” Hernandez said. “But they’ll often say they are still in contact with their faculty, that they still have colleagues that they met here that they are connected with.” The college now serves an average of 11,600 students per quarter, with as many 20,000 students taking classes in a year. That includes 850 students who are enrolled in the college’s Running Start program, which allows high school juniors and seniors to take college-level classes tuition free and earn dual high school and college credit. Edmonds Community College was formally dedicated 49 years ago, on Sept. 7, 1967. On Friday, Sept. 16, the school officially launches a yearlong celebration of 50 years in the community with festivities at Triton Field. Starting at 4 p.m. that day, there will be live music, food from local food trucks and drinks from a no-host beer and wine garden – and everyone in the community is invited. Appropriately, the master of ceremonies for the Sept. 16 celebration is Don Wick, EdCC’s first elected student body president. Now retired, Wick served as executive director of the Skagit County Economic Development Association. In 2002, the Edmonds Community College Foundation named him a Distinguished Alumni. The college offered its first classes in leased space at the former Woodway High School, and portable buildings also housed classrooms on college property while the school was being built on the former site of the U.S. Army’s Northwest Relay and Radio Receiving Station. The radio station, constructed in 1930, was operated by the U.S. Army and the Alaska Communication System to provide service to Alaska during World War II. An Enterprise newspaper clipping announcing the college’s graduating class of 24 in 1969. EdCC’s first graduate – in 1968 – was Susan Blackborn. The following year, in 1969, the college graduated 24 students. As Edmonds CC enters its 50th year, the college now sits on a 50-acre campus in Lynnwood. It features 28 computer labs, nine science labs, three restaurants, two greenhouses, a digital recording studio, an art gallery, a theater, a child care center, a gym, Triton Field, a transit center, an on-campus residence hall and a university satellite center for Central Washington University. Mountlake Terrace City Councilmember Laura Sonmore Over the years, the college has produced many leaders – both in the ranks of its alumni and its employees. Among them is Mountlake Terrace City Councilmember Laura Sonmore, a Mountlake Terrace native who has served on the city council for 16 years. Sonmore earned her bachelor’s degree in law and justice from Central Washington University but prior to that received her paralegal degree from Edmonds CC, where she served as student body president and received a Distinguished Alumni Award in 2004. Now a Boeing Company employee, Sonmore recalled being one of seven students selected – out of more than 700 applicants – to participate in an Edmonds CC leadership program in 1980 called Lead and Earn. “ It was fabulous! “ she said. “We worked on every program on campus during the summer — for the president office, financial office, bookstore. During school I ran the art and cultural program with a budget of $35,000.” Lynnwood Mayor Nicola Smith City of Lynnwood Mayor Nicola Smith was serving as Edmonds CC’s Dean of Student Life and Development when she was elected to lead the city in 2013. Smith, who started working at the college in 1987, remembered being on the planning committee for the college’s 25th anniversary. “At that time the college was climbing to great heights with an entrepreneurial attitude, quickly adjusting to serve local and international educational needs,” Smith said. “Through the years, EdCC has adjusted educational services to serve the economic ebbs and flows, developed degrees to train people to current job needs and embraced a culture that included students in a holistic community experience,” including on-campus housing and a strong athletic program, she added. Describing the college as “a jewel in South Snohomish County,” Smith pointed to “child care that teaches parenting skills and supports family success; the LEAF School that partners with tribes, government agencies, non-profits, and businesses to engage students through service-learning and community-based research; and, through student leadership and government.” Edmonds Mayor Dave Earling Edmonds Mayor Dave Earling remembers being hired to start the instrumental music department at nearby Shoreline Community College in 1967 just prior to the establishment of Edmonds CC. “My, my, my and EdCC is now a leader in the state community college system,” Earling said. “Innovative, creative, proactive and engaged in the communities. Jean Hernandez and her staff truly understand the importance of working locally and at the same time being a regional player.” For Hernandez, the school’s success comes back to that sense of community. As an example, she cited a scholarship program, set up by faculty in the adult basic education pre-college program, designed to cover students’ pressing needs. “Whenever any of their students need tuition money or money for books, they can give it to them from this pot of money, and that has been just an amazing support,” Hernandez said. There is also a support system for employees, started by an Edmonds CC staff member who first came to the college 20 years ago as a financially struggling single mother, Hernandez said. The woman was able to attain her high school diploma through the Edmonds Career Access Program (EdCAP), which helps students earn a high school diploma in a college setting. Now in her early 40s, she went on to earn both associates and bachelors degrees and now serves as a counselor and case manager for the EdCAP program. “She came to us and said, ‘Why don’t we have an emergency fund for our own employees?’” Hernandez said, adding such a system is now in place for employees in need. That EdCAP counselor also serves as a role model for others, Hernandez noted. “When she meets with students, she tells them, ‘Hey, I was homeless, I was poor and look at me now, working as a full-time advisor in higher education. You can do it too.’” Anyone walking around the Edmonds CC campus can’t miss the school’s diverse student population, which includes 38 percent students of color. The school also has nearly 1,500 international students from 62 countries. Of those international students, about one-third come to Edmonds CC as high school juniors and senior so they can obtain a U.S. high school diploma, and another one-third participate in the college’s intensive English as a Second Language program. Upon completing those programs, students usually don’t stay at the college for a two-year degree but instead jump directly to a four-year university. International students contribute to the school’s cultural diversity. International student tuition helps to support the college financially, Hernandez said, noting that students coming from other countries “have to prove they have the financial means” before attending EdCC. Even though they pay three times more in tuition than domestic students, international students find it’s cost-effective to complete their two-year degree at Edmonds CC, then transfer to a four-year school, she added. The issue of college affordability weighs on Hernandez’s mind. “It’s sad to see people in their mid-20s leaving college with this huge debt,” she said. She supports President Obama’s call for free community college tuition for students coming directly out of high school, although there appears to be little likelihood of such a measure coming out of the gridlocked U.S. Congress. She stressed the importance of college students “really figuring out what is your goal or purpose in life and then what do you need to have a living wage or a means of supporting your family or yourself financially.” That may mean a two-year or four-year college degree, or it may mean a certificate program for a specific skill. “There’s a lot more talk about work readiness, job readiness and that’s definitely a hallmark for community colleges,” Hernandez said. “For most of us, 35-50 percent of our programs are work-related, while at a university those pretty much are all, ‘get your bachelors or masters and then you can get a job.’” Statistics show that students are more likely to complete college if they start right out of high school and take a full class load. That’s why the college this year launched a program offering to cover the cost of first-quarter textbooks to any graduating high school senior from the Edmonds School District. Students must have a 2.5 GPA or higher, and register for at least 15 credits to receive a voucher of up to $500 for books at the on-campus Barnes and Noble bookstore. “If a student is full time, not only do they save money, they save time and are more likely to complete,” Hernandez said. “The momentum’s there.” Some of the state’s community colleges have expanded their scope to include four-year degrees. In Bellevue, for example, the school now offers a bachelor of science degree in nursing and has dropped “community” from its name. Edmonds Community College is moving toward also offering a select number of four-year “applied baccalaureate” degrees, which focus on skills-based training, but will continue to be known as a community college, Hernandez said. A bachelor of Applied Science in Child, Youth, and Family Services has just been approved and still in planning stages, and Edmonds CC hopes to offer it in either spring or fall 2017. Other possible degrees are in the early planning stages, Hernandez said. But the bottom line is to ensure that students are following the path that is right for them. “Sometimes you don’t need a bachelor’s degree for what you want to do in life,” she said. “You need a certificate or two-year degree. So if we help you figure it out sooner, it’s going to save you time and money.” To that end, the college is looking into developing a program called guided pathways, which works to help students identify sooner what career path they’d like to follow, and what specific classes they need to get there. The college is exploring development of a guided pathways program to help students identify a career path. The idea is this: In the first quarter, students are part of a cohort – such as engineering, health or business – that includes career exploration. If you are in the health cohort, for example, you’d be asked whether you were interested in becoming a doctor, a registered nurse or a pharmacist. “You have students learn what those options are and then based on that, you get them into the right pipeline,” Hernandez said. “If you want to go into pharmacy, get a two-year pharmacy tech, then transfer to the University of Washington for a bachelor’s in biology and go on to become a doctor of pharmacy.” “It’s much more intrusive but it’s also very upfront, very clear what classes you need to be successful in those particular fields,” she added. “About 25 percent of our students are the first generation in their families to go to college, so they are not really sure why they’re here or where to begin. It helps to provide that sort of support for them.” The college also has a major capital project in the pipeline: construction of a $36 million science, engineering and technology building that Hernandez said will become “a hub for engineering, physics, chemistry, all the sciences that are out there.” While funding hasn’t been officially awarded, the Edmonds CC building is first on the list for community college capital projects, “and I would be very surprised if we did not get it,” Hernandez said. Groundbreaking for the building, to be located between the college gym and Mountlake Terrace Hall, is anticipated in summer 2017. New banners on campus celebrating the school’s 50th anniversary also sport a new logo featuring the Triton, the school’s mascot. Despite five decades of success, Hernandez said there is still more work ahead for Edmonds Community College – and that comes down to educating the community about what’s available to them close to home. “I would like to see us do a better job of saturating our community,” she said. “I think there are still a lot of individuals in our backyard who either don’t realize how easy it is to get into college or how there are so many ways to pay for it. “I would love to see higher percentage of our community educated over the next two to four years, knowing that they are going to have a better chance of making a living wage if they have a year or two years (of college) under their belt.” — By Teresa Wippel SHARE Facebook Twitter tweet Previous articleReminder: American Association of University Women to host kickoff event Sept. 10 Next articleEditor at large: Till fence do us part Administrator First and last name must be used for comment to be approved.

Elected officials joined representatives from the U.S. Department of Defense and others to christen the San Jose, Calif., headquarters and research facility of NextFlex America's Flexible Hybrid Electronics Manufacturing Institute. The Department of Defense (DoD) previously awarded the cooperative $75 million in grant funding so the cooperative - comprised of a mix of public and private companies with advanced scientific capabilities, as well as leading universities - could ensure that the United States leads the world in producing the kinds of wearable electronic devices that could have groundbreaking applications for the military and health care. The cooperative brings together a diverse set of members - other Fortune 500 companies in addition to Eastman include General Electric, Boeing and Raytheon - that can bring diverse scientific and technology expertise to the table and accelerate innovation. Eastman, which has a research and development site in nearby Palo Alto, contributes world-class materials science capabilities and a materials understanding is an essential building block of flexible hybrid electronics (FHE). This FHE technology combines printed electronics manufactured on flexible substrates with semiconductor devices. Members of NextFlex America's Flexible Hybrid Electronics Manufacturing Institute are working together to develop, pilot and manufacture these technologies in forms that can be attached to the human body. These FHEs could also be attached to vehicles or other structures. A key facet is that FHEs can be bent, rolled, folded and integrated physically in ways that traditional, rigid electronics cannot. The potential to put technology on human bodies in order to monitor the health and stress levels of soldiers on the battlefield - or for medical patients in the health care setting - could vastly improve medical response time or provide advance notification that medical intervention is necessary, which would improve health and save lives. FHE devices could also be leveraged to improve other devices that include robotic prosthetic limbs for injuries soldiers, amputees or cancer survivors, as well as sensor patches for premature babies that are too fragile for traditional blood work and tests.  "Eastman is excited to collaborate with other innovation leaders who are driving the cutting edge of advanced technologies," said Steve Crawford, Eastman senior vice president and chief technology officer. "The Eastman team values this type of collaboration and believes this could be a true differentiator in accelerating the development of technologies that will have a significant impact on how we live in the future." The cooperative is part of the National Network for Manufacturing Innovation program, a federal initiative to support advanced manufacturing in the United States and secure U.S. leadership in emerging technologies. The $75 million award from the DoD was augmented by another $96 million in public and private funding.

Video provided by Newsy Newslook Expedition 48 Commander Jeff Williams on June 30, 2016, monitored bowling ball-sized internal satellites known as SPHERES aboard the International Space Station. On Wednesday, Aug. 24, 2016, Williams set a U.S. record for most cumulative days in space with 521 over four missions. His record is expected to total 534 days by the time he returns to Earth in early September. (Photo: NASA via Florida Today) MELBOURNE, Fla. — Scott Kelly is widely known as the Ironman of U.S. astronauts after his recent yearlong mission aboard the International Space Station, during which he set a NASA record for most cumulative days in space with 520 over four flights. But as of Wednesday, that career record belongs not to Kelly but Jeff Williams, an unassuming NASA veteran who doesn't mind if his six-month tour lacks the promotion and buzz of Kelly's "#YearInSpace." The commander of the station’s six-person Expedition 48 crew marked his 521st day in space Wednesday, a total expected to reach 534 days by the time he returns to Earth on Sept. 6 to conclude his fourth spaceflight. On Wednesday, Kelly called Williams to congratulate him on his achievement. "I wanted to congratulate you on passing me up here in total number of days in space," said Kelly. "It's great to see another record broken. ... But I do have one question for you. And my question is: You got another 190 days in you?" .@StationCDRKelly congratulates @Astro_Jeff on breaking his record of 520 total days in space by a U.S. astronaut! https://t.co/y9BxzUWtgH— Intl. Space Station (@Space_Station) August 24, 2016 Williams said, "That question's not for me, that's for my wife." Don’t expect the retired Army colonel — a 58-year-old grandfather who is the oldest NASA astronaut to live on the orbiting laboratory complex — to boast about the achievement. “It’s an honor to spend any day in space, and certainly to have accumulated that time is truly an honor for me,” Williams told NASA TV recently. But he prefers to shift the attention to the station itself, which he considers humanity’s greatest technological feat, and the international partnership that has put it together. USA TODAY Spacewalk opens door for Boeing, SpaceX crews “That’s really the bigger story to me, personally,” he said. Williams’ 20-year astronaut career has spanned the station’s assembly, which began in 1998. His first flight was a 2000 shuttle mission that helped set up the fledgling outpost for its first permanent crew later that year. Crews have now lived continuously on the space station for nearly 16 years. Since that 10-day shuttle flight, it’s been all long-duration missions for the Wisconsin native, who has launched three times from Kazakhstan on Russian Soyuz spacecraft. He’s the first American to serve on three International Space Station expeditions, which typically last five or six months each. The previous two were in 2006 and 2010, before station construction was officially complete. Williams’ current mission has helped set the stage for the station’s next chapter, which will rely more on commercial operations. .@Astro_Jeff breaks @NASA_Astronauts time in space record held by @StationCDRKelly. https://t.co/QlMHon6rztpic.twitter.com/mUTlOMLM22— Intl. Space Station (@Space_Station) August 24, 2016 On Friday he performed his fourth spacewalk, pairing with NASA’s Kate Rubins to install a docking port that opened the door for Boeing and SpaceX crew capsules to visit the outpost late next year or in early 2018. They are preparing for another spacewalk next week. Williams also has helped set up a prototype habitat module designed by Bigelow Aerospace, a potential precursor to private space stations that could follow the space station. A West Point graduate in 1980, Williams later earned two master’s degrees and finished first in his class at the U.S. Naval Test Pilot School. Still, it took him about 10 years and multiple applications to win entry into NASA’s astronaut corps in 1996. He preaches perseverance to young people. Williams is old enough to remember Russia as a Cold War adversary. Now he sees the space station partnership involving the U.S., Russia, Europe, Japan and Canada as a model for peaceful international relations. USA TODAY NASA astronaut Williams to set U.S. spaceflight record “I trust that it serves as a very positive example to the world below,” he said. When he returns to Earth in less than two weeks, Williams told CBS News recently that he looks forward to seeing family and friends and to “the simple things in life.” Those include smells of Earth often taken for granted, relaxing in quiet without the station’s constant hum of fans and pumps, and anything his wife will cook for him. “She’s the real hero in all of this, putting up with me being up here that many days over the years,” he said. And Williams knows records are made to be broken. In fact, Peggy Whitson, currently fourth on NASA's career list with 377 days in space, is scheduled to launch to the International Space Station in November and set a new U.S. record next year.

By Jeffrey Lin & Peter W. Singer China Will Resurrect The World's Largest Plane Signs deal to restart Ukrainian An-225 By Jeffrey Lin and P.W. Singer posted Sep 7th, 2016 at 10:15am Antonov An-225 The An-225, which can carry 250 tons of cargo, is the world's heaviest aircraft. China buying and building An-225s would exponentially increase its power projection capabilities not just in Asia, but across the world. On August 30, members of the Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AICC) and the Antonov Corporation, the leading Ukrainian aviation company, signed an agreement to restart production of the AN-225, the world's largest cargo aircraft. Antonov To Space The An-225's large size was the result of its initial mission to transport the massive Soviet Buran space shuttle, which could weigh up to 105 tons, to launch. Unrealized Soviet planes also intended for the An-225 to launch other reusable space launch systems in mid air. The 640 ton, six engine An-225 is the world's largest aircraft. Measuring at 84 meters in length and a wingspan of over 88 meters, it carries a world record payload of 250 tons (to put this into comparison, it can carry around 300,000 lbs more than the US military's Boeing made C-17). The sole operational An-225 began flying in 1988, initially carrying the Soviet Buran, a 105 ton reusable spaceplane, on its back. It was put into storage after the Soviet collapse, but restored and put into commercial service in 2002. Since then it has been rented out, flying super heavy cargos like gas and wind turbines, as well as military supplies for NATO forces in the Middle East. Ivchenko Progress D-18T The powerful Ivchenko Progress D-18T turbofan, which produces 23 tons of thrust, will also be license produced by China to power domestically built An-225, and possibly other Chinese heavy transport aircraft. The first phase of the agreement between AICC and Antonov will result in the completion and flight of the incomplete second An-225 in 2019. The second stage of the project will involve the complete transfer of technology, including the 23 ton thrust Progress D-18T turbofan engines, to China, for licensed production of a modernized version in Sichuan Province. =GT at China Defense Forum 3325 3325 is the first of China's domestically built Zubr armed hovercraft, commissioned in early 2014. Weighing over 400 tons fully loaded, it can carry three battle tanks or company of armed soldiers. Presaging the An-225 deal, China purchased Ukrainian built Zubrs, as well as domestically building Zubrs at Chinese shipyard under license produciton. Despite China's close relationship with Russia, Ukraine's rival, China has purchased outright and licensed a number of Ukrainian aviation and naval platforms, such as the ex Varyag aircraft carrier, the Zubr hovercraft and the An-178. Antonov itself has also provided design and technical advice for the Chinese ARJ-21 region jetliner and Y-20 heavy transport aircraft. CCTV Forward Sino-Ukrainian Relations The official announcement and signing of the understanding to restart the An-225 production line was given high support by the Chinese government, despite the official Chinese partner, AICC, being relatively undersized compared to the AVIC industrial giant. With the ceremony signed in the Diaoyu state guesthouse in Beijing, and presence of senior government officials, it is clear that there is strong government support for China for this deal. While AICC itself is a relatively small company, it could leverage its government connections to draw heavily on aviation giant AVIC's extensive Sichuan production base. Antonov Waiting for 2019 With much of the fuselage structurally complete, the second An-225 will have its wings, engines and avionics integrated on in the next three years before being handed over to China in 2019. Compared to the first An-225, it has a rear mounted cargo door and single tail, suggesting a greater emphasis on transporting internal cargo, compared to its Buran space shuttle carrying older brother. Finishing the second An-225 by 2019 is an achievable goal, given that the airframe is already 60-70 percent complete. AICC will likely provide the majority of $300 million needed to complete the aircraft. Assuming that the second phase of the deal is completed, a completely Chinese version of the An-225 could begin first flights in the mid 2020s. Ukrainian Internet Belly of the Mriya In addition to carrying space shuttles, the An-225 could carry multiple tanks, such as these four main battle tanks. A Chinese An-225 could not only carry a platoon of China's latest heavy tanks, but also other military cargo like missile launchers and heavy artillery. For China, the An-225 would open whole new frontiers in commercial and military air transportation. A fleet of civilian An-225s could quickly ship heavy and bulky cargoes of massive scale, ranging from construction equipment to consumer goods. For humanitarian purposes, the An-225 could support disaster relief operations, able to fly in not just large amounts of aid, but also by bringing infrastructure like power generation and water treatment that are normally too big for airlift. On the military front, the An-225 would provide China with the kind of large and global lift that not even the US has possessed, except by rental. The plane is large enough to carry helicopters, tanks, artillery and ballistic missiles to anywhere in the world, or even other aircraft like smaller fighter jets. The An-225's unparalleled payload could even make it a space launch platform, or the ultimate mothership for drone operations. In many ways, China's build up of global airlift capabilities mirrors the immense gains it has made in global sealift, investing deeply to reach across the globe in coming year.

What Happened to Sea Launch by Staff Writers Bethesda MD (SPX) Sep 07, 2016 Rumors about the future of Sea Launch are frequently aired. As of last week, media reports indicated that the floating launch platform was to be sold in 2017, probably to Russian investors. So, stay tuned for the next, or final, chapter in the bumpy life of Sea Launch. Sea Launch is a unique space launch system intended to be an attractive way to launch geostationary earth orbit (GEO) satellites. It was developed as a multinational endeavor that uses a mobile maritime launch platform for equatorial launches of commercial payloads on a specialized Zenit-3SL launch system. The first launch took place in March 1999 with launches occurring for the next 15 years. A total of 36 attempts produced 32 complete successes and one partial success. Almost all payloads were communications satellites intended for geostationary transfer orbit (GTO). Customers included EchoStar, DirecTV, XM Satellite Radio, PanAmSat, and Thuraya. Launch vehicle assembly and payload integration were done on a special-purpose ship, Sea Launch Commander, in Long Beach Harbor, California. Before leaving the harbor, an assembled vehicle was placed on top of a self-propelled seagoing platform, Ocean Odyssey, and both the ship and platform steamed to an equatorial launch location on the Pacific Ocean, south of Hawai'i. A sea-based launch system means launches can be made from the optimum position on Earth's surface for geostationary satellites. This situation leads to increased payload capacity and reduced per-kg launch costs compared to other launch locations. Furthermore, the satellite may experience extended life on station due to a lower propellant expenditure upon final GEO injection. Unfortunately, due to financial and geopolitical complications, in 2014, Sea Launch had to mothball both ship and platform, and stop operations. Looking back to 1995, Sea Launch was originally established as a consortium of four companies from Norway, Russia, Ukraine and U.S. It was managed by Boeing and based in Long Beach, CA. Operations were carried out by participants from the shareholder companies. Normal operations took place for 10 years, but in 2009, the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Nevertheless, Sea Launch claimed it would continue normal business operations after filing for reorganization. However, about a year later, Energia, a 25% owner, announced a plan to acquire controlling interest in the company. One result of this was the introduction of land-based launches from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in early 2011. Sea-based launches were to resume later that year. Sea Launch did emerge from bankruptcy in October 2010 as Energia Overseas Limited, a Russian corporation. Boeing and other U.S. companies did retain minority shares. However, in 2013, Boeing sued the Russian Energia and two Ukrainian partners, claiming the companies refused to pay more than $350 million following the joint venture's bankruptcy filing in 2009. Jumping to mid-2014, following the Russian military intervention in Ukraine, a number of Russian media reports indicated Sea Launch might mothball the Odyssey launch platform. These claims were denied. Nevertheless, in August 2014, Sea Launch reduced staff and stopped operations, because they had no launches scheduled until late 2015. In fact, its last launch was in May of 2014. Rumors about the future of Sea Launch are frequently aired. As of last week, media reports indicated that the floating launch platform was to be sold in 2017, probably to Russian investors. So, stay tuned for the next, or final, chapter in the bumpy life of Sea Launch.

In an apparent attempt to reassure people that the search is being performed to the highest standards, the Australian Transport Safety Bureau’s latest update contained a detailed explanation of the methods employed. The explanation coincided with a special briefing for families of MH370 passengers and crew by search contractor Fugro and the ATSB in Perth. Thk for the hospitality and clarification, it's emotional, informative & educational.

She posted her gratitude for the information on social media, tweeting “thanks for the hospitality and clarification”. #mh370 Fugro/ATSB briefing pic.twitter.com/RUkFApN2cX— Jennifer Chong (@Jannilixious) September 7, 2016 Jennifer Chong with her husband Chong Ling Tan who was on board the Malaysian Airlines’ flight that vanished. Picture: SuppliedSource:Supplied The meeting was organised by the Joint Agency Coordination Centre at the request of Malaysian next of kin, desperate to see the search continued until the plane is found. Ministers from Australia, Malaysia and China decided in July that without fresh evidence, the search would be suspended once the entire 120,000 square kilometre priority zone was completed. So far more than 110,000 square kilometres of seabed has been searched, leaving less than 10,000 square kilometres to go. Almost done. Less than 10,000 square kilometres of the search zone is left to be scoured as the MH370 operation nears an end. Picture: ATSBSource:Supplied The ATSB update pointed out the sonar data collected by search vessels was reviewed and analysed on board for signs of the aircraft, and then subsequently examined by analysts in the Fugro office in Perth and by the ATSB in Canberra. “A final independent analysis of the data is then conducted by experts in the United States of America,” said the report. Aircraft manufacturer Boeing has played a major part in the investigation but it was unclear if the experts were part of the organisation. At least 22 sites will be revisited before the end of the search with an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle capable of operating in more challenging terrain. The main problem is the AUV can only be used in relatively calm conditions associated with the spring and summer months in the Southern Indian Ocean. Tough job. Rough conditions have plagued the MH370 search in the winter months. Picture: ATSBSource:Supplied There are currently no vessels in the search area, due to bad weather and scheduled resupply of Fugro Equator. Tomorrow (September 8) marks exactly two-and-a-half-years since MH370 disappeared on a flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. All communication with the Boeing 777 was lost less than an hour into the flight, but satellite transmissions have allowed experts to plot a path for the plane into the Southern Indian Ocean. Debris recovered from islands in the western Indian Ocean and east and South Africa, continue to be examined for information about how the plane entered the water and where. Larry Vance on evidence MH370 was glided into ocean0:29 Senior air crash investigator Larry Vance told Channel 9?s 60 Minutes program, a flaperon found on Reunion Island last year and handed over to France for analysis was the strongest clue yet the aircraft was ?glided? into the ocean.

The S&P 500 and Dow Industrials both edged higher last week after a weaker-than-expected monthly jobs report on Friday bolstered the view that the Fed won't raise interest rates in September, fueling a rise in stocks and other assets perceived as relatively risky. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished up 46.16 points, or 0.3%, at 18,538.12. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite rose 26.01 points, or 0.5% to a new closing high of 5,275.91. The S&P 500 index rose 6.50 points, or 0.3%, to close at 2,186.48, led by sharp gains in energy, utilities, and telecom stocks. The benchmark index erased its opening loss by midday as heavily-weighted health care and technology demonstrated relative strength. The broader market settled near its best level of the day with seven sectors ending in the green. The defensively-oriented telecom services and utilities sectors followed energy on the top of the board. Conversely, financials and industrials led the downside. Chevron Corp and Boeing shares led the average higher, closing up more than 1%, while shares of Nike, United Technologies, Home Depot and General Electric weighed on blue chips. The Institute for Supply Management said Tuesday that its nonmanufacturing index fell to 51.4% last month from 55.5% in July. That was the weakest showing since February 2010. The key takeaway from the ISM report is that it appears as if both the manufacturing sector and the non-manufacturing sector experienced a noticeable slowing of activity in August. U.S. employment data released last Friday had already shown slower overall job growth in August and an unemployment rate holding at 4.9%. The added takeaway is that the slowdown seen on both sides of the economy will likely leave the Fed reluctant to raise the fed funds rate at its September meeting. A number below 50.0 denotes a general contraction in manufacturing activity. The ICE U.S. Dollar Index, a measure of the greenback against a basket of six rival currencies, was down 1.1% as gold prices settled. The greenback and dollar-denominated commodities tend to move inversely. Bullion prices rallied on Tuesday, 06 September 2016 to log their highest settlement in nearly three weeks as a fall in the U.S. service-sector index to its weakest level in over six years appeared to diminish the likelihood of a U.S. interest-rate hike this month, fueling a drop in the dollar. December gold jumped $27.30, or 2.1%, to settle at $1,354 an ounce. December silver soared higher by 77.2 cents, or 4%, to $20.138 an ounce. Gold prices last week had eked out a weekly gain of less than 0.1%, but lost 3.4% for the month of August, the first monthly loss since May. Crude oil futures settled on a mixed note on Tuesday, 06 September 2016 with West Texas Intermediate crude ending at a one-week high and Brent crude finishing with a loss as traders eyed a pact between the world's two largest crude producers, Russia and Saudi Arabia, aimed at stabilizing the market. October West Texas Intermediate crude rose 39 cents, or 0.9%, to settle at $44.83 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, after trading as low as $43.84 during the session. November Brent crude meanwhile, fell 37 cents, or 0.8%, to end at $47.26 a barrel after settling Monday up 1.7% at $47.63. Russian and Saudi officials on Monday said they would set up a working group to monitor the oil market and come up with recommendations to promote stability. The announcement gave a lift to crude prices though those gains faded by afternoon as the news underwhelmed traders who had been hoping for a production freeze. Treasuries ended on a higher note with yields dropping through the curve. The yield on the 2-yr note ended lower by seven basis points (0.72%) while the yield on the 10-yr note settled lower by seven basis points (1.54%). Today's participation was above the recent average as more than 835 million shares changed hands on the NYSE floor. Tomorrow's economic data will include the 7:00 ET release of the weekly MBA Mortgage Index. Separately, the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey for July and the Fed's Beige Book for September will cross the wires at 10:00 ET and 14:00 ET, respectively.

(Getty Images - Representational Image) Shares11 Wed, 7 Sep 2016-11:44am , Cape Canaveral (US) , Reuters A U.S. space probe was cleared for launch on Thursday to collect and return samples from an asteroid in hopes of learning more about the origins of life on Earth and perhaps elsewhere in the solar system, NASA said on Tuesday. A United Launch Alliance Atlas 5 rocket was scheduled to blast off from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida to dispatch the robot explorer Osiris-Rex on a seven-year mission. United Launch Alliance is a partnership of Lockheed-Martin and Boeing. ALSO READ NASA images unveil origins of solar wind Osiris-Rex is headed to a 1,640-foot (500-meter) wide asteroid named Bennu, which circles the sun in roughly the same orbit as Earth. Scientists estimate there is a one-in-800 chance that Bennu might actually hit Earth 166 years from now. Heating from the sun gently pushes the asteroid, and charting its path is among the goals of the $1 billion mission. The U.S. space agency also hopes Osiris-Rex will demonstrate the advanced imaging and mapping techniques needed for future science missions and for upcoming commercial asteroid-mining expeditions. ALSO READ NASA asteroid mission on track despite SpaceX rocket explosion Osiris-Rex is expected to reach Bennu in August 2018 and begin a two-year study of its physical features and chemical composition. The solar-powered spacecraft will then fly to Bennu's surface and extend a robot arm to collect at least 2 ounces (60 grams) of what scientists hope will be carbon-rich material. "We're going to asteroid Bennu because it's a time capsule from the earliest stages of solar system formation, back when our planetary system was spread across as dust grains in a swirling cloud around our growing protostar," lead researcher Dante Lauretta of the University of Arizona told a prelaunch news conference on Tuesday. ALSO READ NASA shortlists US teen's idea for Mars rover landing site Inside the developing solar system, small rocky bodies were beginning to form, many of them studded with water ice and organic materials, which are key compounds that may have made Earth habitable or even given life its start, Lauretta said. If all goes as planned, the capsule containing samples from Bennu will be jettisoned from the returning Osiris-Rex spacecraft on Sept. 24, 2023, for a parachute descent and landing at the U.S. Air Force Utah Test and Training Range. Osiris-Rex is the latest in a series of missions to asteroids that began with the 1991 flyby of asteroid Gaspra by NASA's Jupiter-bound Galileo spacecraft. Japan's Hayabusa 1 probe managed to return a few tiny grains of asteroid Itokawa to Earth in 2010, the first asteroid sample return mission. A follow-on mission, Hayabusa 2, is underway. The Osiris-Rex launch was set for between 7:05 p.m. and 9:05 p.m. on Thursday.

Exploited is the word, according to prisoners and their advocates. So on Sept. 9, prison inmates are planning what's said to be an unprecedented national work strike, "a call to action against slavery in America." It's a story you may not hear much about, but one worth paying attention to. Prison demonstrations have been growing across the country in reaction to overcrowding, poor living conditions and unpaid labor at the hand of prison systems and the corporations that profit from them. In April, inmates at seven Texas prisons went on a work strike to protest living and working conditions. Prisoners in Alabama, Michigan, California and Wisconsin this year have organized work stoppages and hunger strikes. We're now looking at the first national strike, maybe the largest coordinated act of resistance in U.S. prison history. The date, Sept. 9, is the anniversary of the nightmarish Attica prison rebellion in 1971. More than 1,000 inmates took over Attica in western New York, demanding better conditions. Gov. Nelson Rockefeller ordered state police to storm the place, and they shot and killed 29 inmates and 10 hostages. Prison conditions overall improved after the 1970s, largely due to lawsuits and court orders, says Marc Mauer of The Sentencing Project, a non-profit advocating for criminal justice reform. But with the 1980s crack epidemic came the start of mass incarceration – tough-on-crime laws that locked up many more low-level offenders, a disproportionate number of them black, for longer periods of time. The number of people in U.S. prisons and jails is five times what it was in the '70s. Ohio's prison system was built for 38,000 inmates, but it houses more than 50,000 and is expected to grow more. We're among the worst states for over-incarceration in a country that leads the world in incarcerating its citizens. There's enormous profit potential in captivity. Corporations now own a prison in Ohio (the first state to sell a prison), and operate prisons throughout the land. For-profit companies have a piece of the action in health care and food services. Prisoners work on farms and in factories, and staff call centers for corporations. They often earn nothing or up to a few dollars a day. Starbucks, Boeing and McDonalds all have profited off prison labor. Private prison companies have spent millions lobbying for stricter laws to keep the inmates flowing, and they have occupancy quotas in their contracts. Ohio guarantees payment to Corrections Corporation of America, which owns Ohio's Lake Erie Correctional Institute, for 90 percent occupancy. The U.S. Department of Justice in August underscored the failings of corporatization with a stunning announcement that it would end the use of private prisons. The DOJ concluded private prisons are too dangerous, their programs and services are subpar, and they don't save much money. But that's only a piece of the federal prison system. Meanwhile, Ohio insists corporatizing prisons is a money-saver. Through legislation passed last year, the state plans to sell a second state prison, the North Central Correctional Institution in Marion. This is after the 2011 sale of Lake Erie Correctional in Conneaut prompted a state inspection committee and the American Civil Liberties Union of Ohio to expose terrible conditions there -- increased violence, rampant drug use, unsanitary food and general dysfunction. There was no running water in certain areas, forcing inmates to shit in bags. The ACLU made a film about it, Prisons for Profit, which premiered at the Cleveland International Film Festival last year. "Privatization, exploitation of labor, this all branches off the same rotten tree, which is our mass incarceration system," Mike Brickner of the Ohio ACLU says. "Because of that, all these problems come cascading down." North Central Correctional Institution is already privately operated by Management and Training Corp. JoEllen Smith, spokeswoman for the Ohio prison system, says both privately operated facilities "perform in a manner that is safe and secure, as demonstrated by their contractually required accreditation status by the American Correctional Association and compliance with Ohio internal management audit standards." Smith did not comment on the prospect of a Sept. 9 prison strike, nor would she answer questions about contracting out prison labor. But at least one person who helps organize prisoners from the outside said Ohio is among states she expects to have strong participation. Azzura Crispino handles media for the Incarcerated Workers Organizing Committee, a new labor organization that has had a hand in strikes in various states. The labor group two years ago spun off from Industrial Workers of the World, a union formed in 1905 and headquartered in Chicago, after prison organizers and outside supporters sought help addressing working and living conditions. Crispino said more than 800 prisoners affiliate with the group, and there are more supporters who don't want to be known as members for fear of punishment. "The prisoners who are getting paid a wage at all for their labor is rare," she says. "The system is doing exactly what it's designed to do: Extract as much money off the backs of prisoners as possible." A few months ago, incarcerated organizers put out the call to action: "On Sept. 9 of 2016, we will begin an action to shut down prisons all across the country. We will not only demand the end to prison slavery, we will end it ourselves by ceasing to be slaves." It would be nice to know how it plays out, but those involved say prisons most certainly will black out communications to whatever extent possible. Ohio had a prison watchdog – a maverick named Joanna Saul, who exposed troubles at Lake Erie Correctional and who called out the state's food-service vendor for serving up maggots. It's hard to argue against the need for a watchdog. But Saul apparently ruffled too many feathers in a Republican legislature gaga over corporatizing public services. They forced her out in June.

A United Launch Alliance Atlas 5 rocket was scheduled to blast off from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida to dispatch the robot explorer Osiris-Rex on a seven-year mission. United Launch Alliance is a partnership of Lockheed-Martin and Boeing. Osiris-Rex is headed to a 500 metre wide asteroid named Bennu, which circles the sun in roughly the same orbit as Earth. Scientists estimate there is a one-in-800 chance that Bennu might actually hit Earth 166 years from now. Nasa’s Origins, Spectral Interpretation, Resource Identification, Security-Regolith Explorer (Osiris-Rex) spacecraft is seen on display at Kennedy Space Center, Florida August 20, 2016. — Reuters pic Heating from the sun gently pushes the asteroid, and charting its path is among the goals of the US$1 billion (RM4 million) mission. The US space agency also hopes Osiris-Rex will demonstrate the advanced imaging and mapping techniques needed for future science missions and for upcoming commercial asteroid-mining expeditions. Osiris-Rex is expected to reach Bennu in August 2018 and begin a two-year study of its physical features and chemical composition. The solar-powered spacecraft will then fly to Bennu’s surface and extend a robot arm to collect at least 60g of what scientists hope will be carbon-rich material. “We’re going to asteroid Bennu because it’s a time capsule from the earliest stages of solar system formation, back when our planetary system was spread across as dust grains in a swirling cloud around our growing protostar,” lead researcher Dante Lauretta of the University of Arizona told a prelaunch news conference yesterday. Inside the developing solar system, small rocky bodies were beginning to form, many of them studded with water ice and organic materials, which are key compounds that may have made Earth habitable or even given life its start, Lauretta said. If all goes as planned, the capsule containing samples from Bennu will be jettisoned from the returning Osiris-Rex spacecraft on September 24, 2023, for a parachute descent and landing at the US Air Force Utah Test and Training Range. Osiris-Rex is the latest in a series of missions to asteroids that began with the 1991 flyby of asteroid Gaspra by Nasa’s Jupiter-bound Galileo spacecraft. Japan’s Hayabusa 1 probe managed to return a few tiny grains of asteroid Itokawa to Earth in 2010, the first asteroid sample return mission. A follow-on mission, Hayabusa 2, is underway. The Osiris-Rex launch was set for between 7.05pm and 9.05pm on Thursday (2305 to 0105 GMT on Friday). — Reuters                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week African rats to turn sensitive noses against pangolin poaching Trump's 'look-alike' at China safari park (VIDEO) Danish bishop’s 300-year-old poo offers whiff of history Trump Tower: Gaudy, glittery home to next US president Sleep, train and eat like a champ: Endurance training advice from Dr Andrew Murray Trump Tower: Gaudy, glittery home to next US president Blood pressure spike around doctors might point to heart problem A secret beauty pageant for Indonesia’s transgender women Refugees discover two Americas: One that hates, and one that heals Veganism gains ground in Singapore Most Watched Now Week Britney Spears, TInashe get down for a ‘Slumber Party’ (WARNING: EXPLICIT LANGUAGE) Neil Patrick Harris stars as Count Olaf in trailer for ‘A Series of Unfortunate Events’ Jessica Chastain in ‘The Zookeeper’s Wife’ Ah Beng reviews iguana’s epic escape from snakes (WARNING: EXPLICIT LANGUAGE) Did you know: The ocean is way deeper than you think Reuters Video: Thailand sinks boats to tackle illegal fishing Related Articles From Broadway to outer space: US election snippets (VIDEO) Astronaut casts lone vote from space You’ll want to mark your calendars for the biggest moon of the century (VIDEO) Sekali seumur hidup, peluang melihat bulan ‘paling besar’ Ewen Whitaker, who guided Nasa to the moon, dies at 94 Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2016 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | RecomN - Local Services

By WallaceWitkowski Reporter AnoraMahmudova Reporter U.S. stocks closed slightly higher Tuesday, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq logging a record close as investors digested a weak services-sector report, which might help convince the Federal Reserve to stay its hand as it considers raising interest rates. The S&P 500 index SPX, -0.23%  rose 6.50 points, or 0.3%, to close at 2,186.48, led by sharp gains in energy, utilities, and telecom stocks. Earlier, a slide in retail was checked by the dollar’s downturn. The prospect of lower rates for longer tends to be a negative for the currency, but a lower dollar is beneficial to multinational companies, making their exports relatively cheaper. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.20%  finished up 46.16 points, or 0.3%, at 18,538.12. Chevron Corp CVX, +0.47% and Boeing Co. shares led the average higher, closing up more than 1%, while shares of Nike Inc. NKE, -0.18% United Technologies Corp. UTX, -0.08% , Home Depot Inc. HD, -0.76% and General Electric Co. GE, -0.81%  weighed on blue chips. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, -0.25%  rose 26.01 points, or 0.5% to a new closing high of 5,275.91. Also, the Russell 2000 index RUT, +0.04%  briefly touched a 52-week high of 1,254.41 Tuesday, and closed up fractionally just above 1,253. Read: Small-cap stocks aim high thanks to U.S. economy The Institute for Supply Management said its nonmanufacturing index fell to 51.4% last month from 55.5% in July—the slowest pace of growth since 2010. Bond yields and the dollar fell sharply following the report as investors continue to play down the possibility of a rate rise this year. “Pessimism about retailers earlier was due to bad weather on the East Coast impacting back-to-school spending, as well as news over the weekend about the bankruptcy of Korean shipping giant Hanjin Shipping Co. that resulted in chaos in some ports,” said Diane Jaffee, senior portfolio manager at TCW. Analysts said the Tuesday session is likely to see stocks trade in a fairly narrow range as U.S. investors try to shake off the cobwebs after an extended weekend, with the market closed on Monday for Labor Day. “After a number of important data last week, which were all soft, markets are in a slight consolidation mode,” said Karyn Cavanaugh, market strategist at Voya Investment Management. “The fact that a ‘soft news is good news’ mentality appears back is not great in the long term. But the lack of alternative investment choices will continue to drive U.S. stocks higher in the short term because of relatively attractive valuations,” Cavanaugh said. The S&P 500 and Dow industrials both edged higher last week after a weaker-than-expected monthly jobs report on Friday bolstered the view that the Fed won’t raise interest rates in September, fueling a rise in stocks and other assets perceived as relatively risky. “Stocks are up about 7% since the start of the year, which is not euphoric and there has been a distinct rotation out of defensive stocks into riskier sectors—all because investors are relying on the Fed and other central banks to absorb any risk,” Cavanaugh said.

MON, +0.28% closed down 1.4%, following an earlier session rise, after German chemicals titan Bayer AG BAYN, -0.48%  raised its bid for the U.S. company to $127.50 a share, up from $125 a share. General Electric Co. GE, -0.81%  shares declined 0.8% after the conglomerate said it would acquire two European 3-D printing companies for a combined $1.4 billion, gobbling up Sweden’s Arcam AB ARCM, +0.00% and Germany’s SLM Solutions Group AG AM3D, -2.51% In the deal’s wake, shares of U.S. 3-D printing companies Stratasys Ltd. SSYS, +0.54%  and 3-D Systems Corp. DDD, +1.70% closed up 3.8% and 5.6%, respectively. The 3-D Printing ETF PRNT, -0.24% which launched in July and hasn’t attracted much investor money, closed up 5.6%. Enbridge Inc. ENB, +0.06% and Spectra Energy Corp. SE, +0.06% announced a stock-for-stock merger transaction, valuing Spectra’s common stock at $28 billion to create North America’s largest energy infrastructure company. Enbridge rallied 5.1%, while Spectra closed up more than 13%. Cepheid US:CPHD  soared 53% to close at $52.53 following news that conglomerate Danaher Corp. DHR, -1.40%  plans to buy the maker of clinical testing gear for $53 a share in cash, or about $4 billion. Danaher shares fell 2.1%. Chip maker Marvell Technology Group Ltd. MRVL, +8.27%  dropped 0.5% after reporting that quarterly revenue fell more than expected and issuing a mixed outlook.

European stocks SXXP, -0.29% were slightly higher. Gold futures GCZ6, -0.81%  rallied 2.1% to settle at $1,354 an ounce, their highest level since Aug. 18, and a key dollar index DXY, +0.50% lost ground. Asian stock markets were broadly higher Tuesday, though Australian equities XJO, +0.39% fell after the central bank there kept interest rates unchanged, and the Philippine benchmark PSEI, +0.25%  fell after U.S. President Obama canceled a meeting with the country’s leader.

NASA asteroid probe may find clues to origins of life on Earth Reuters 07-09-2016 By Irene Klotz © REUTERS Artist rendering of NASA's OSIRIS-REx spacecraft is seen in an undated handout image A U.S. space probe was cleared for launch on Thursday to collect and return samples from an asteroid in hopes of learning more about the origins of life on Earth and perhaps elsewhere in the solar system, NASA said on Tuesday.

If all goes as planned, the capsule containing samples from Bennu will be jettisoned from the returning Osiris-Rex spacecraft on Sept. 24, 2023, for a parachute descent and landing at the U.S. Air Force Utah Test and Training Range. Osiris-Rex is the latest in a series of missions to asteroids that began with the 1991 flyby of asteroid Gaspra by NASA's Jupiter-bound Galileo spacecraft. Japan's Hayabusa 1 probe managed to return a few tiny grains of asteroid Itokawa to Earth in 2010, the first asteroid sample return mission. A follow-on mission, Hayabusa 2, is underway. The Osiris-Rex launch was set for between 7:05 p.m. and 9:05 p.m. on Thursday (2305 to 0105 GMT on Friday).

United Launch Alliance is a partnership of Lockheed-Martin and Boeing. Osiris-Rex is headed to a 1,640-foot (500-meter) wide asteroid named Bennu, which circles the sun in roughly the same orbit as Earth. Scientists estimate there is a one-in-800 chance that Bennu might actually hit Earth 166 years from now. Heating from the sun gently pushes the asteroid, and charting its path is among the goals of the $1 billion mission. The U.S. space agency also hopes Osiris-Rex will demonstrate the advanced imaging and mapping techniques needed for future science missions and for upcoming commercial asteroid-mining expeditions. Osiris-Rex is expected to reach Bennu in August 2018 and begin a two-year study of its physical features and chemical composition. The solar-powered spacecraft will then fly to Bennu’s surface and extend a robot arm to collect at least 2 ounces (60 grams) of what scientists hope will be carbon-rich material. “We’re going to asteroid Bennu because it’s a time capsule from the earliest stages of solar system formation, back when our planetary system was spread across as dust grains in a swirling cloud around our growing protostar,” lead researcher Dante Lauretta of the University of Arizona told a prelaunch news conference on Tuesday.

Around the 25th District with Rep. Steve Knight Uploaded: , Tuesday, Sep 6, 2016 By Press Release Around the District Service Academy Information Day Do you know someone who is interested in applying to a United States military service academy? On September 17 my office is hosting an information gathering event for students considering application for 2017 appointment to the U.S. Military Academy, U.S. Air Force Academy, U.S. Coast Guard Academy, U.S. Merchant Academy, and the U.S. Naval Academy. More information here.   Supplier Roundtable Last week I sat down with representatives from small businesses around the community that work with Boeing. We discussed their operations and how we can help by reducing the federal government’s regulatory burden on growing businesses and by encouraging students to pursue STEM fields and other skills like materials science, wood working, and metal working. Discussing small business issues with Boeing suppliers Pinning Ceremony Last Tuesday we had another great Medal Pinning Ceremony at Crazy Otto’s Diner in Lancaster. We presented a long-overdue Army Good Conduct Medal and the Army Commendation Medal with Oak Leaf Cluster to Danny Bazzell, a fellow U.S. Army veteran and fixture in our local veteran community. Congratulations Danny! Kiwanis Breakfast On August 31 I started my morning with at the Kiwanis Club breakfast at the Junkyard in Simi Valley. It was great to catch up with old friends and make new ones over some fantastic food. Breakfast with Kiwanis Club of Simi Valley Dedication Ceremony It was an honor to attend last Wednesday’s dedication ceremony for the Simi Valley Police Officer Michael Clark Memorial Overcrossing. Thank you to the Simi Valley Police Department and everyone else involved in honoring our fallen officer. Veterans Lunch After the Dedication Ceremony I caught up with some local Simi Valley veterans at El Patio Restaurant & Cantina for lunch and some excellent conversations. Thanks for having me! Chatting with local Simi Valley veterans Farmers Insurance Visit Following lunch I had the opportunity to meet and talk with local employees at Farmers Insurance Group. I learned about their program to help veterans as they transition out of the military as well how our office can help them with issues they may have with federal agencies. Giving a legislative update to Farmers Insurance employees Fighting for Flight On Thursday I attended the F-35 Lightning II mobile cockpit demonstrator showcase at Skunk Works in Palmdale. The F-35 helps with two of my top priorities: creating jobs and protecting the American warfighter, and I was proud to “fly” it in the Antelope Valley. “Flying” the F-35 Lightning II mobile cockpit demonstrator  Coffee with a Cop Last week I met with community members at the monthly Coffee with a Cop, hosted by the Palmdale Sheriff’s Station. I appreciate Capt. Kneer and the deputies that were there to answer questions. Coffee with a Cop in Palmdale Ending Veteran Homelessness I was very happy to hear the VA’s announcement last week about the grants they provided to several local organizations working to help homeless and at-risk veterans and families. Veteran homelessness is a horrible issue in our community and across the country, but by supporting these local initiatives we are taking a solid step toward solving this tragic problem.

The Aug. 3 crash, which injured 24 of the 300 people on board and led to the death of a firefighter on the ground, happened after Dubai International Airport issued a windshear warning while clearing the Boeing Co. 777 to land, the report from the United Arab Emirates General Civil Aviation Authority says. Flight EK521 from India approached the airport in a following wind of 16 knots, with the right-hand wheels hitting the ground three seconds before the left side in an attempted touchdown that was more than a kilometer beyond the runway perimeter, triggering a “long landing” warning in the cockpit, the study says. The jet attempted a go-around maneuver and subsequently encountered a headwind, climbing to a height of only 85 feet before sinking back onto the runway at a descent rate of 900 feet a minute. The 777-300 came down on its tail and engines, with the wheels having been retracted after the aborted landing, the report says. One turbine broke off as the plane slid along the runway, causing “an intense fuel-fed fire,” with the flight’s captain issuing a Mayday call and ordering an evacuation. The firefighter was killed when a fuel tank exploded, sending a 15-meter wing section into the air, about nine minutes after the plane had come to rest and the blaze had appeared to be under control. A flight attendant was hospitalized for five days with smoke inhalation, with all other injuries classified as minor. The aircraft itself was destroyed. The crash was the worst in the 30-year history of Dubai-based Emirates, the world’s biggest airline by international traffic. The preliminary report didn’t say whether the plane should have been allowed to land, or if its pilots behaved correctly during the approach and subsequent go-around attempt. Further findings will be released in due course, with the aircraft’s performance, technical and engineering aspects, the airline’s procedures, air navigation provision, firefighting measures and weather forecasting all under scrutiny, the regulator said.

A United Launch Alliance Atlas 5 rocket was scheduled to blast off from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida to dispatch the robot explorer Osiris-Rex on a seven-year mission. United Launch Alliance is a partnership of Lockheed-Martin and Boeing. Osiris-Rex is headed to a 1,640-foot (500-meter) wide asteroid named Bennu, which circles the sun in roughly the same orbit as Earth. Scientists estimate there is a one-in-800 chance that Bennu might actually hit Earth 166 years from now. WATCH: NASA’s Juno spacecraft uncovers new details about Jupiter Story continues below Heating from the sun gently pushes the asteroid, and charting its path is among the goals of the $1 billion mission. The U.S. space agency also hopes Osiris-Rex will demonstrate the advanced imaging and mapping techniques needed for future science missions and for upcoming commercial asteroid-mining expeditions. Osiris-Rex is expected to reach Bennu in August 2018 and begin a two-year study of its physical features and chemical composition. The solar-powered spacecraft will then fly to Bennu’s surface and extend a robot arm to collect at least 2 ounces (60 grams) of what scientists hope will be carbon-rich material. “We’re going to asteroid Bennu because it’s a time capsule from the earliest stages of solar system formation, back when our planetary system was spread across as dust grains in a swirling cloud around our growing protostar,” lead researcher Dante Lauretta of the University of Arizona told a prelaunch news conference on Tuesday.

If all goes as planned, the capsule containing samples from Bennu will be jettisoned from the returning Osiris-Rex spacecraft on Sept. 24, 2023, for a parachute descent and landing at the U.S. Air Force Utah Test and Training Range. WATCH: NASA conducts successful test of rocket that could carry manned mission to Mars   Osiris-Rex is the latest in a series of missions to asteroids that began with the 1991 flyby of asteroid Gaspra by NASA’s Jupiter-bound Galileo spacecraft. Japan’s Hayabusa 1 probe managed to return a few tiny grains of asteroid Itokawa to Earth in 2010, the first asteroid sample return mission. A follow-on mission, Hayabusa 2, is underway. The Osiris-Rex launch was set for between 7:05 p.m. and 9:05 p.m. on Thursday (2305 to 0105 GMT on Friday). © 2016 Thomson Reuters Report an error Bennu Bennu asteroid Cape Canaveral NASA NASA Space probe OSIRIS-REx Space probe U.S. space probe United Launch Alliance Atlas 5 rocket Editor's Picks Consumer How Trump's immigration crackdown could raise food prices for Canadians Politics Trudeau Liberals ‘trampling’ on women’s rights with new CPP regime: opposition Money Here's how much mortgage payments will go up as banks hike rates Consumer Text message fraud cost Canadians half a million dollars so far in 2016 Investigations Ontario schools are missing ‘perfect opportunity’ to address mental health amid rash of youth suicides Health Drugs aren’t tested on women like they are on men, and it could have deadly consequences Investigations How mental health should be taught in Canadian schools FLYERS More Weekly Flyers Comments Popular Now Jon Stewart slams 'hypocrisy' of labelling all Donald Trump voters racist 10477 Father sentenced to 40 years in jail for killing his daughter’s sexual abuser 9377 Earth on track to heat up to devastating levels by 2100, scientists say 9217 WATCH: Polar bear seen petting sled dog near Churchill, Manitoba 9160 How the ‘mystery shopper’ scam fooled a young mother, a factory worker and a senior 7097 Sponsored content Popular Videos Expert weighs in on 14-year-old girl who wins right to be cryogenically frozen WATCH NOW Mystery shopping texts sent to Canadians turn out to be scam WATCH NOW MPs Michelle Rempel and Elizabeth May argue over the use of the word ‘fart’ in House of Commons WATCH NOW Man dies after falling into acidic hot spring in Yellowstone National Park WATCH NOW Love and loss, a Saskatoon couple shares their NICU story WATCH NOW Jump to a Region BC Calgary Edmonton Halifax Lethbridge Montreal New Brunswick Okanagan Regina Saskatoon Toronto Winnipeg Connect Facebook Twitter Google+ Instagram LinkedIn Tumblr Pinterest RSS Contact Us Global News About Us Privacy Policy Principles & Practices Terms & Conditions Copyright Corus Entertainment Advertise Branded Content Open Data © 2016 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.

Yet many US platforms bought have turned out to be less than cutting-edge, after New Delhi’s unwillingness to sign what Washington labels a “foundational agreement” — the Communications Interoperability and Security Memorandum of Agreement (CISMOA) — has forced the replacement of closely-guarded radio, communications security and navigation kits with lower-grade, commercially-available equipment. One example is the C-130J Super Hercules Special Forces plane, in which the Indian Air Force (IAF) will transport commandos to small landing strips in enemy territory, which would have been pre-secured by a ground team. Such operations need secure communications between the aircraft and the team on the runway, so that the C-130J is not enticed into a trap. America tightly controls the radios used for this, denying it to countries that have not signed CISMOA. So far India has opted for less secure, costlier, commercially available radio kits, rather than signing CISMOA. Similarly, the Indian Navy’s Boeing P-8I maritime aircraft is among the world’s most effective submarine hunters. But, detecting and pinpointing an enemy submarine is only the first step; attacking it requires the P-8I to communicate with naval forces nearby, and with shore-based naval facilities. Since these voice and data channels —called Data Link-11 and Link-16 — are guarded under CISMOA, the P-8I has been equipped with older communication links that could be intercepted. The absence of these links also prevents the P-8I from generating a Common Tactical Picture with friendly regional navies, who operate over CISMOA-protected links.   There are other such cases. In a conflict with China, the absence of Link-16 would prevent IAF fighters from generating a Common Air Picture, even if friendly air forces were eager to inform on the activities of the People’s Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF). Non-signature of CISMOA also denies the military precision Global Positioning System (GPS) gear, and state-of-the-art guidance for the Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missile (AMRAAM) that will soon equip IAF fighters. During Business Standard’s visit in June to the Chinook CH-47F helicopter line in Philadelphia, we learnt that India’s 15 Chinooks would not have navigation and radio equipment of the same sophistication as the US Army choppers being built alongside. US Defense Secretary Ashton Carter had in April argued that American weapon systems were capable even without CISMOA-controlled equipment. But he conceded that India was missing out, saying: “I want to emphasise there’s a lot we can do without the foundational agreements; but there’s much more we can do with them.” Carter was part-vindicated on August 29, when Washington and New Delhi signed a Logistics Exchange Memorandum of Agreement (LEMOA) -- the first of the three foundational agreements. Yet that still leaves two: CISMOA, and the Basic Exchange and Cooperation Agreement for Geospatial Information and Services Cooperation (BECA), which lays down protocols for digital mapping and survey. CISMOA negotiations have sputtered on sporadically since 2005. On New Delhi’s request, Washington has agreed to rename the agreement COMCASA — or Communications Compatibility And Security Agreement — to allow India a country-specific agreement, different from what the US Department of Defense (DoD, or Pentagon) has signed with dozens of other countries. A similar logic was employed in the LEMOA, which was given an India-specific name to differentiate it from the Logistics Support Agreements (LSAs) that US has signed with many other countries. Even so, merely renaming the agreement would not make it acceptable to Indian public opinion, since the standard CISMOA draft — the basis of COMCASA negotiations — is inherently more intrusive than LEMOA. A senior Pentagon official who participated in CISMOA negotiations with India confessed: “When we sat down with the MoD in Delhi and the CISMOA experts explained the draft, even we were taken aback by the intrusiveness. We looked at each other and rolled our eyes [indicating], ‘this is not going to happen’.” To assess the key hurdles, Business Standard has scrutinised the text of the CISMOA that the Republic of Korea (South Korea, or ROK) Ministry of National Defence (MND) signed with the US DoD on October 27, 2008. That text requires Korea to provide US personnel access to Korean military bases; reserves for US personnel the right to install, maintain and inspect CISMOA-controlled equipment; bans the transfer of CISMOA-controlled equipment to any third party; bans its indigenous production; and stipulates stringent safeguards for securing, storing and accounting for COMSEC (communications security) equipment obtained from the US. Paragraph V of the agreement requires ROK to pay the full cost of reconfiguring its communication systems to be interoperable with US military systems, and for testing the Korean systems, whenever required. Paragraph IX of the agreement stipulates: “DoD-provided COMSEC equipment and materials, including keying materials, will be installed and maintained only by authorized US personnel… When authorized by the US, qualified ROK personnel may remove and/or replace US COMSEC equipment previously installed by US personnel.” Paragraph X mandates that “DoD-provided COMSEC equipment and materials, including keying materials, will not be subject to any cooperative development, co-production, co-assembly or production licensing agreements.” To be sure, New Delhi will be able to arm-twist Washington into framing a less restrictive COMCASA agreement. The Pentagon has repeatedly offered to address Indian concerns, asking New Delhi to identify objectionable clauses in the standard CISMOA draft. However, New Delhi has not conveyed its Red Lines yet, apparently because the defence ministry has little clarity on its own position. US officials point out that New Delhi had no qualms signing highly restrictive safeguard agreements for the protective technologies installed on the prime minister’s Boeing Business Jet, which are similar to the ones that protect the US president’s aircraft, Air Force One. Says one official: “India displayed a clear understanding of the need to protect those technologies; because VVIP lives depend on that. Why is there a different standard for safeguarding technologies critical for protecting soldiers, sailors and airmen? That is the logic of CISMOA and COMCASA.” Ben Schwartz of the US-India Business Council downplays concerns about the increased access to Indian bases that COMCASA requires, terming it “trivial and about as much of a threat to national sovereignty as granting a multinational telecommunications company a license to operate in India.” He argues that both types of activities take place entirely under the laws of the Government of India.” However, Indian public opinion views the foundational agreements as instruments to tie India into America’s regional military alliances. Left Front parties have always opposed ties with an “imperialist” America. Traditionalists argue that close ties with America would offend Russia. Several opposition parties, particularly the Congress, continue to argue for non-alignment. Says Ashley Tellis, one of the most highly regarded experts on US-India ties: “The Indian debate about the foundational agreements is deeply misleading, centered on commentators' prejudices rather than on facts. Individuals are entitled to their own opinions, not to their own facts.” Given the opposition, Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar is moving cautiously on COMCASA and BECA. After signing LEMOA in Washington last month, he told the media: “After 12-13 years we have managed to get the logistics agreement in place… So let me get this in the public domain properly; explain to the people; then we will definitely go into the other aspects.” Parrikar has his job cut out for him.

That is the logic of CISMOA and COMCASA.” Ben Schwartz of the US-India Business Council downplays concerns about the increased access to Indian bases that COMCASA requires, terming it “trivial and about as much of a threat to national sovereignty as granting a multinational telecommunications company a license to operate in India.” He argues that both types of activities take place entirely under the laws of the Government of India.” However, Indian public opinion views the foundational agreements as instruments to tie India into America’s regional military alliances. Left Front parties have always opposed ties with an “imperialist” America. Traditionalists argue that close ties with America would offend Russia. Several opposition parties, particularly the Congress, continue to argue for non-alignment. Says Ashley Tellis, one of the most highly regarded experts on US-India ties: “The Indian debate about the foundational agreements is deeply misleading, centered on commentators' prejudices rather than on facts. Individuals are entitled to their own opinions, not to their own facts.” Given the opposition, Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar is moving cautiously on COMCASA and BECA. After signing LEMOA in Washington last month, he told the media: “After 12-13 years we have managed to get the logistics agreement in place… So let me get this in the public domain properly; explain to the people; then we will definitely go into the other aspects.” Parrikar has his job cut out for him.

 NASA is paying Russia more than $70 million to bring an astronaut home in this spaceship tonight Dave Mosher and Skye Gould Sep. 6, 2016, 3:36 PM 6,222 facebook linkedin twitter email print A three-module Soyuz spacecraft. NASA Tonight three people who have spent 172 days in orbit above the Earth will attempt to return home. But they won't be riding in a US spacecraft. NASA retired its space shuttle fleet in 2011. Meanwhile, commercial carriers like SpaceX and Boeing are still building, testing, and certifying their spaceships, respectively called Dragon and CST-100 Starliner. Today only one spaceship can launch people more than 200 miles above Earth, drop them off at the International Space Station (ISS), and fly them back: a Russian spacecraft called the Soyuz, which first launched in 1966 and means "union" in Russian. Though Russia's space agency, Roscosmos, has upgraded the three-module Soyuz design several times over the decades, it has hardly changed its core layout. What it charges other space agencies per seat, however, has changed dramatically in recent years. Below is a chart that shows what Russia has historically charged NASA per Soyuz spot since 2006, plus what it plans to charge in the near future, according to a new report that NASA's Office of Inspector General (OIG) released on Thursday, Sept. 1, 2016: How much NASA is paying Russia for each US astronaut seat aboard a Soyuz spacecraft from 2006 through 2018. Skye Gould/Business Insider The cheapest Soyuz seats NASA ever paid for were $21.8 million in 2007 and 2008. As soon as the space agency permanently grounded its space shuttles, though, Russia sharply raised the cost per seat. And it shows no signs of stopping while NASA, JAXA, and the European Space Agency wait for other options. By 2018, NASA and its partners will have to pay roughly $81 million per person to ride a Soyuz to the ISS and back again — a cost increase of 372% in 10 years. (The total cost to NASA over 12 years will be about $3.37 billion.) That contrasts to the $58 million NASA expects to pay per seat aboard SpaceX's and Boeing's ships, or roughly $214 million per space shuttle passenger. (Both numbers account for total lifetime costs of each spacecraft's development.) What will $81 million get you on a Soyuz? One of the safest trips to space, yet cramped between avionics and bags of cargo — for anywhere from 6 hours to 2 days per leg of the journey: Astronauts and a cosmonaut buckled into a cramped Soyuz descent module make for a very tight fit.. ESA/NASA Companies like Space Adventures have also purchased Soyuz seats in the past, sending mega-millionaires like videogame developer Richard Garriott up to the ISS. But the space outfitter's next mission is far more ambitious: It intends to recreate the Apollo 8 mission of 1968 and launch a lucky passenger (and two cosmonaut accomplices) around the moon. At $150 million per seat per lunar trip, it's starting to sound like a bargain.

BUSINESS RECOMMENDED MOST READ RECENT COMMENTS MOST COMMENTED NEWS SECTIONS TOP STORIES TAIWAN CHINA BUSINESS WORLD ASIA SPORTS EDITORIAL COMMENTARY LIFE HEALTH MOVIES ART & LEISURE CLOSE TAB Site Search Submit SEARCH BY DATE CLOSE TAB Text Size Small Medium Large CLOSE TAB Vietnam carriers splurge US$6.5 bil. on new jets Tweet SHARE CLOSE Blogger   Google+ Live Journal   Plurk Stumble Upon     By Tran Thi Minh Ha and Hervi Asquin, AFP September 7, 2016, 12:23 am TWN HANOI -- Vietnam airlines bought 40 airplanes worth US$6.5 billion from France's Airbus Tuesday, as President Francois Hollande visited the communist nation to drum up business ties with one of Southeast Asia's fastest-growing economies. <a href="http://ax-d.pixfuture.net/w/1.0/rc?cs=fb1025fdcc&cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE"><img src="http://ax-d.pixfuture.net/w/1.0/ai?auid=537134883&cs=fb1025fdcc&cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE" border="0" alt=""></a> The deal is the latest move by Vietnamese aviation giants to boost fleets and feed demand from a mushrooming middle class with money to burn on air travel both at home and abroad. Hollande, the third French president to visit Vietnam since independence, said the “very important deals” deepened ties with its former colony where France's legacy is ubiquitous, from the country's colonial-era buildings to French-influenced cuisine. “We agreed to encourage both countries to establish economic partnerships on the basis of technology transfer,” Hollande said after Airbus signed three separate deals. Low-cost private airline VietJet, known for its bikini-clad hostesses, bought 20 planes while national carrier Vietnam Airlines and budget airline Jetstar Pacific bought 10 each in “deals worth 6.5 billion,” Airbus Asia spokesman Sean Lee told AFP. He did not provide a breakdown of each deal's value, but VietJet said later in a statement it was spending US$2.39 billion on its new planes. The VietJet purchase comes after it bought 100 passenger jets from U.S. aircraft maker Boeing for US$11.3 billion in May, during a visit by President Barack Obama. It called the deal the largest single commercial air plane purchase in Vietnam aviation history. Founded in 2007, VietJet has gained notoriety with bikini-wearing air stewardesses and along with Vietnam Airlines and Jetstar is making a major move into the lucrative Southeast Asian aviation sector. Maritime Disputes Hollande, who arrived in Vietnam with around 40 French business leaders, will spend much of Tuesday in Hanoi meeting communist top brass. He will then head south to Vietnam's economic hub Ho Chi Minh City to meet French entrepreneurs, including some from Vietnam's burgeoning tech industry. Vietnam's President Tran Dai Quang said the two leaders also discussed maritime freedom, a key issue for Hanoi which has traded barbs with Beijing over competing claims in the South China Sea. “Me and the president committed to respect the rule of law in the seas and oceans, reaffirming the commitment to maintain freedom of maritime and aviation,” he said. “The two sides stressed the importance of solving disputes by peaceful means, not to use or threaten to use violence on the basis of international laws.” Tensions between Hanoi and Beijing soared in 2014 when China moved a controversial oil rig into disputed waters, sparking angry riots in Vietnam. Hollande's official agenda does not include any plans to discuss human rights or freedom of expression in the tightly run communist country, where bloggers and dissidents are routinely jailed for criticizing the regime. Three human rights groups wrote an open letter to Hollande urging him to press Vietnamese leaders on rights issues during his two-day visit. “Activists and human rights defenders have been regularly subjected to physical assault, surveillance, restrictions on their freedom of movement, and arbitrary arrest and detention,” according to the letter by the International Federation for Human Rights, also signed by a Vietnamese and French rights group.

Photographer: STR/EPA Report says 777 had sought to touch down too far down runway Plane rose 85 feet in subsequent go-around bid before plunging Share on FacebookShare on Twitter Share on LinkedInShare on RedditShare on Google+E-mailShare on TwitterShare on WhatsApp An Emirates jet crashed last month after trying to land too far down the runway in a strong tailwind and failing in a bid to take off again when the gusts changed direction, according to a preliminary study into the accident. The Aug. 3 crash, which injured 24 of the 300 people on board and led to the death of a firefighter on the ground, happened after Dubai International Airport issued a windshear warning while clearing the Boeing Co. 777 to land, the report from the United Arab Emirates General Civil Aviation Authority says. Flight EK521 from India approached the airport in a following wind of 16 knots, with the right-hand wheels hitting the ground three seconds before the left side in an attempted touchdown that was more than a kilometer beyond the runway perimeter, triggering a “long landing” warning in the cockpit, the study says. The jet attempted a go-around maneuver and subsequently encountered a headwind, climbing to a height of only 85 feet before sinking back onto the runway at a descent rate of 900 feet a minute. The 777-300 came down on its tail and engines, with the wheels having been retracted after the aborted landing, the report says. One turbine broke off as the plane slid along the runway, causing “an intense fuel-fed fire,” with the flight’s captain issuing a Mayday call and ordering an evacuation. Explosion The firefighter was killed when a fuel tank exploded, sending a 15-meter (50-foot) wing section into the air, about nine minutes after the plane had come to rest and the blaze had appeared to be under control. A flight attendant was hospitalized for five days with smoke inhalation, with all other injuries classified as minor. The aircraft itself was destroyed. The crash was the worst in the 30-year history of Dubai-based Emirates, the world’s biggest airline by international traffic. The preliminary report didn’t say whether the plane should have been allowed to land, or if its pilots behaved correctly during the approach and subsequent go-around attempt. Further findings will be released in due course, with the aircraft’s performance, technical and engineering aspects, the airline’s procedures, air navigation provision, firefighting measures and weather forecasting all under scrutiny, the regulator said.

NASA OIG said in an audit report published Thursday that it also found delays in the agency’s assessment and approval of requests for variances and hazard reports submitted by Boeing and SpaceX as part of the certification process. NASA has also failed to track the timeliness of its process for safety reviews, according to the report. OIG’s audit report, which is a follow-up to the November 2013 review of the Commercial Review Program, also revealed that NASA has decided to extend its contract with the Russian space agency, Roscosmos, to bring astronauts to the ISS through 2018 at approximately $490 million in additional cost due to delays in the program. The inspector general has asked NASA’s associate administrator for human exploration and operations to enforce methods to monitor the timeliness of its review process. NASA should also collaborate with SpaceX and Boeing to facilitate reviews of hazard reports and variance requests in a timely manner, the IG added. The report also noted that NASA said it will continue to conduct weekly meetings with its two contractors to address such reports.

The Boeing-built land-based nuclear deterrent was test fired from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California by a team of Air Force Global Strike Command Airmen from the 341st Missile Wing. The testing was aimed at validating the operational credibility of the ICBM system. The re-entry vehicle, comprising of a telemetry package used for operational testing, travelled approximately 4,200 miles to the Kwajalein Atoll in the Marshall Islands. Air Force Task Force commander lieutenant colonel Ron Clough said: “I’m extremely proud of the 21 maintainers and operators from the 341st Missile Wing Task Force who worked flawlessly alongside the professionals from the 576th Flight Test Squadron to make this mission a success. "An effort on this scale, and the enormous insights it gives to force readiness, continue to showcase the Minuteman III as the world's premier deterrence and assurance capability." “An effort on this scale, and the enormous insights it gives to force readiness, continue to showcase the Minuteman III as the world's premier deterrence and assurance capability.” The test launches verify the accuracy and reliability of the ICBM weapon system, by providing data to ensure a continued safe, secure and effective nuclear deterrent. The data collected from test launches will be used by the ICBM community, including the US Department of Defense, the Department of Energy, and US Strategic Command for continuing force development evaluation.

The agreement, witnessed by French President François Hollande, who is visiting Vietnam, provides for the aircraft to be delivered between 2017 and 2020. Airbus Tuesday also said it signed a memorandum of understanding with Vietnam Airlines to acquire 10 more A350-900 long-range jets, doubling the size of it fleet of the widebody planes. The deal carries a list price value of about $3 billion. The order underscores the rapid expansion of the budget carrier since it began operating in 2011. The country's only privately owned carrier, VietJet is also set to become Vietnam's largest carrier, eclipsing state-owned rival Vietnam Airlines, aviation analysts say. In addition to Tuesday's announcement and the previous $11 billion order with Boeing to buy 737 jets, unveiled during U.S. President Barack Obama's visit to the country in May, VietJet agreed last year to buy 30 Airbus A321 planes for $3.6 billion. "VietJet is developing robustly and sustainably with an aim at better serving our passengers and promoting tourism and economic development in Vietnam and other regional countries," said airline President and CEO Nguyen Thi Phuong Thao. Vietnam is one of the fastest-growing aviation markets in Asia, which itself is one of the fastest-growing regions for the industry. VietJet previously has noted that the Vietnam market has grown 20% in each of the past three years, and the airline is adding new international routes to cater to growing demand for outbound travel from the country's growing middle class. Airbus also said it finalized a purchase agreement with Vietnam's Jetstar Pacific Airlines for the sale of 10 A320 single-aisle planes valued at $980 million at list prices. The carrier owned, by Vietnam Airlines and Qantas Airways Ltd., is already leasing 12 of the Airbus narrowbodies, the European plane maker said. Robert Wall in London contributed to this article.

Two U.S. astronauts sailed through a seven-hour spacewalk outside the International Space Station on Thursday to pack up a spare cooling radiator and tackle other maintenance, a NASA TV broadcast showed. In their second spacewalk in two weeks, Commander Jeffrey Williams and Flight Engineer Kate Rubins left the station's airlock around 8 a.m. EDT (1200 GMT) as the station orbited 250 miles (400 km) above Earth. "It's good to be out here," said Rubins, 37. On Aug. 19, Rubins and Williams installed a docking system to enable commercial space taxis currently in development to park at the station, breaking Russia's monopoly on crew transport. Test flights of Space Exploration Technology's Crew Dragon capsule are expected to begin next year, followed by the debut of Boeing's CST-100 Starliner in 2018. It was not immediately known what impact, if any, the loss of a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket during a routine prelaunch test in Florida on Thursday would have on the company's other programs. For Thursday's spacewalk, the astronauts headed to the far end of the station to retract a radiator that was last used in 2012. See Also: A student at Moi University dies during abortion Folding up the panel will protect it from strikes by micrometeors and orbital debris, NASA flight director Zeb Scoville told an Aug. 24 news conference. "We really want to be able to get it retracted and covered up so we can count on it in the future, should the need arise," Scoville said. Williams, making his fifth spacewalk, and Rubins then tackled several maintenance tasks, including installing a high-definition camera on the station's truss so ground controllers can better inspect the Russian Soyuz capsules that ferry crew members to and from the station, a $100 billion project in which 15 countries are participating. Williams, along with Russian cosmonauts Alexey Ovchinin and Oleg Skripochka, are scheduled to climb aboard one of the two Soyuz capsules docked at the station on Tuesday, ending their 172-day mission. Williams, 58, will return home as NASA's most-experienced astronaut. During his four spaceflights, including three stints aboard the space station, Williams surpassed the 520-day cumulative record of former U.S. astronaut Scott Kelly, with 534 days in orbit.

Source: AAP 6 Sep 2016 - 1:24 PM  UPDATED 6 Sep 2016 - 1:24 PM Tweet Australia is poised to benefit from billions of dollars in defence exports to the United States, US Ambassador to Australia John Berry says. Speaking at the Land Forces defence exhibition in Adelaide on Tuesday, Mr Berry said the event had attracted attention from US defence giants Lockheed Martin, Boeing and Northrop Grumman. "(They) are here today because they know the value of the Australian market and the mutual benefits that accrue from our joint collaboration," he said. "Ours is not just a strategic partnership - it is an economic one as well." Mr Berry said Australia was the third-biggest importer worldwide of defence systems, spending more than $US2 billion ($A2.6 billion) with "a good part of that" on US defence industries. But it was not a one-way street, with the involvement of Australian defence technology companies in the massive Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) program to create $US4 billion of exports for Australia. The US also hoped to partner in the development of Australia's $20 billion Land 400 armoured fighting vehicles, which Mr Berry described as the "JSF of the land". BAE Systems Australia and a partnership between German company Rheinmetall Landsysteme Gmbh and US firm Northrop Grumman have been shortlisted to deliver the vehicles. Mr Berry said the US and Australia had a shared vision to strengthen the "rules-based international order" and a key feature of their partnership was the development of compatible and innovative defence systems. "It is a vision enshrined in Australia's Defence White Paper and one that you can count on the US to uphold its partnership in ," Mr Berry said. "When we utilise common systems and tactics, we can confidently and efficiently deploy anywhere, any time, any place."

Weather Your 4-day local weather forecast Saturday November 19, 2016 News Local News Larger / SmallerNight Mode Pilot Chris Higgins shares his success story Lisa Tisdell@tisdell_lisa 6 Sep 2016, noon Pilot Chris Higgins and Hastings District Flying Club are inspiring the next generation of pilots. Living the dream: Pilot Chris Higgins at the controls of the RV8 aircraft built by Bob Needham’s son Anson. Mr Higgins is an American-based pilot. BECOMING a pilot was Chris Higgins’ link to freedom from poverty. As a teenager living west of Wauchope, he simply wanted to fly a plane. Support from Hastings District Flying Club members helped make that dream a reality. Mr Higgins, who started learning to fly with Bob Needham in 1984, now flies VIPs around the world. He said being a pilot had allowed him to remain optimistic. “It gave me a lot of pride and was a story of hope for my family and friends,” Mr Higgins said. His career has ranged from being a bush pilot to teaching aerobatics, working as an airline instructor and company oral examiner on the Boeing 75/767, and being a private jet pilot. Mr Higgins said he had tremendous support in the early days from Hastings District Flying Club and others at Port Macquarie Airport. Petrochemical engineer Hans Westphal helped the youngster bridge the gap in maths, physics and chemistry. That set up Mr Higgins to ace his commercial theory licence on the first attempt. “For a child who did not respond well in the formal tutorial world of the school desk and blackboard, the painless learning of a social environment was a much more effective way of teaching me at that point,” he said. “Those kinds of experiences in a social environment are an essential part of the air safety equation in the learning environment of a young aviator.” He advised aspiring pilots to dream as big as possible. “But if you get diverted along the way, you can’t lose heart,” Mr Higgins said. “You have to be prepared to change your goals to suit the circumstances, the times, the economy, your love interests and everything else as you go.” Mr Higgins said Hastings District Flying Club had a wonderful history of taking young men and women through the mentoring and formal instruction process. Two flying scholarships are up for grabs courtesy of the Hastings District Flying Club and Chris Higgins. The scholarships are each valued at $1200. Mr Higgins hopes the scholarships will have the same life changing influence on its recipients as the flying club had on his life. The scholarship applications closed on August 31. Hastings District Flying Club president Rod Davison said learning to fly was very character building. The club members see the young people mature and grow in confidence. Mr Davison said the club appreciated Mr Higgins’ kind sponsorship gesture. The club has a proud history dating back to 1958.

Bombardier cuts its C Series delivery forecast for 2016 because engine supplier Pratt & Whitney is having production issues with its new Geared Turbofan engine. Bo Rader File photo i By Jerry Siebenmark jsiebenmark@wichitaeagle.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story Just as the parent of Wichita’s Learjet had gained some momentum on its new narrowbody airliner program, Bombardier said it would cut by more than half the number of C Series aircraft it was planning to deliver this year. In an update this week, Bombardier said it would deliver seven C Series jetliners in 2016, down from the 15 deliveries it had expected to make. But Bombardier said the cut to its delivery forecast wasn’t of its own doing. Rather it’s because the C Series’ engine maker, Pratt & Whitney, can’t deliver its geared turbofan engines fast enough. A fairly quick resolution to the slow engine production is something Bombardier needs to meet its plan of reaching financial stability and profitability in the next few years, Teal Group analyst Richard Aboulafia said Wednesday. “The main problem is just Bombardier has a very tight window in terms of ramping up production and achieving profit by 2020,” he said. “Developments like this just complicate that problem.” Bombardier, which employs about 1,800 people in Wichita, was already two years behind schedule and $2 billion over budget before delivering its first C Series CS100 airliner in June to Swiss International Airlines. Swiss has since taken delivery of a second CS100 and both aircraft have accumulated nearly 600 flight hours, almost 400 hours of which were revenue flights. Analysts have pointed to the C Series delays and cost overruns that nearly drained the company of cash as one reason why Bombardier last year canceled development of the Learjet 85 business jet. That led to the layoff of 600 Wichita workers. Bombardier said in its update it doesn’t expect a “material” effect to its 2016 earnings before interest and taxes but revenue in its commercial aircraft unit will be lower, though it didn’t say by how much. “We are working very closely with Pratt & Whitney to quickly address this supplier ramp-up issue and to ensure we have a strong supplier based to support our long-term growth objectives,” Bombardier Commercial Aircraft president Fred Cromer said in the update. For its part, Pratt & Whitney said in an e-mailed statement Wednesday it is working to overcome the production delays. “In terms of production, we’ve made significant headway in the supply chain, but there is some pressure on new engine deliveries for this year,” the statement said. “We are working closely with our customers on the delivery schedule, and we are keeping them apprised of the progress being made.” Pratt’s Geared Turbofan engine has won five national and international awards, including from Popular Science, Aviation Week and the China Aviation Association and AVIC Science and Technology department. Pratt claims the engine offers a 16 percent reduction in fuel burn, a 75 percent decrease in the noise footprint and a 50 percent reduction in regulated emissions. Former Delta Air Lines CEO Richard Anderson said in January that the geared turbofan engines are “really the first big innovation since the (Boeing) 787.” About three months later, Delta placed a firm order for 75 CS100s and options for 50 more. It’s not unusual for early production delays to occur on a new airplane or jet engine. But Aboulafia thinks Pratt is struggling with the engine because it will be used on a variety of commercial airplanes – Airbus A320neo, Embraer E190-E2, Mistubishi Regional Jet and Irkut MC-21 – and each one of those aircraft will have a different version of it. “What really complicates things is that Pratt is trying to ramp up and develop an unprecedented number of variants of the same engine at once,” he said. “There’s always complications between variants.” Aboulafia thinks there’s a “very good chance” Pratt will successfully work through its engine production issues and not upset Bombardier’s turnaround plan. But if that effort takes too long, “it just complicates Bombardier’s efforts to keep its head above water,” he said.

NASA’s Jeff Williams, 58, logged 534 days in space over four missions. The ISS commander landed at 7:13 local time (0113 GMT) on the steppes of central Kazakhstan aboard a Russian-made Soyuz capsule along with Alexey Ovchinin and Oleg Skripochka. “Touchdown! Welcome home @Astro_Jeff, officially back on Earth after 172-day mission & total 534 days on 4 missions,” NASA tweeted. A NASA live video feed showed Williams on the ground smiling and waving while talking on a satellite phone before being carried away for medical tests. The three men undocked from the ISS nearly three and a half hours earlier after spending their mission largely conducting scientific experiments. Williams performed five space walks, including one along with NASA astronaut Kate Rubins to install a docking adapter for future commercial Boeing and SpaceX crew capsules to visit the space station. “Williams was instrumental in preparing the station for the future arrival of US commercial crew spacecraft,” NASA said in a statement. He also helped set up an experimental temporary inflatable module designed by Bigelow Aerospace to test expandable habitats astronauts might use on the Moon or Mars in the coming decades. The retired Army colonel beat the previous US record set by astronaut Scott Kelly during his year in orbit. Kelly has 520 days in space over his career. Williams, a grandfather, is also the oldest American to spend live on the space station. Williams first blasted to space aboard the shuttle Atlantis in 2000.

NASA's Williams passes Scott Kelly's U.S. space record James Dean, Florida Today Wednesday, 24-Aug-16 17:50:27 PDT Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest MELBOURNE, Fla. — Scott Kelly is widely known as the Ironman of U.S. astronauts after his recent yearlong mission aboard the International Space Station, during which he set a NASA record for most cumulative days in space with 520 over four flights. But as of Wednesday, that career record belongs not to Kelly but Jeff Williams, an unassuming NASA veteran who doesn't mind if his six-month tour lacks the promotion and buzz of Kelly's "#YearInSpace." The commander of the station’s six-person Expedition 48 crew marked his 521st day in space Wednesday, a total expected to reach 534 days by the time he returns to Earth on Sept. 6 to conclude his fourth spaceflight. On Wednesday, Kelly called Williams to congratulate him on his achievement. "I wanted to congratulate you on passing me up here in total number of days in space," said Kelly. "It's great to see another record broken. ... But I do have one question for you. And my question is: You got another 190 days in you?" .@StationCDRKelly congratulates @Astro_Jeff on breaking his record of 520 total days in space by a U.S. astronaut! https://t.co/y9BxzUWtgH— Intl. Space Station (@Space_Station) August 24, 2016 Williams said, "That question's not for me, that's for my wife." Don’t expect the retired Army colonel — a 58-year-old grandfather who is the oldest NASA astronaut to live on the orbiting laboratory complex — to boast about the achievement. “It’s an honor to spend any day in space, and certainly to have accumulated that time is truly an honor for me,” Williams told NASA TV recently. But he prefers to shift the attention to the station itself, which he considers humanity’s greatest technological feat, and the international partnership that has put it together. USA TODAY Spacewalk opens door for Boeing, SpaceX crews “That’s really the bigger story to me, personally,” he said. Williams’ 20-year astronaut career has spanned the station’s assembly, which began in 1998. His first flight was a 2000 shuttle mission that helped set up the fledgling outpost for its first permanent crew later that year. Crews have now lived continuously on the space station for nearly 16 years. Since that 10-day shuttle flight, it’s been all long-duration missions for the Wisconsin native, who has launched three times from Kazakhstan on Russian Soyuz spacecraft. He’s the first American to serve on three International Space Station expeditions, which typically last five or six months each. The previous two were in 2006 and 2010, before station construction was officially complete. Williams’ current mission has helped set the stage for the station’s next chapter, which will rely more on commercial operations. .@Astro_Jeff breaks @NASA_Astronauts time in space record held by @StationCDRKelly. https://t.co/QlMHon6rzt pic.twitter.com/mUTlOMLM22— Intl. Space Station (@Space_Station) August 24, 2016 On Friday he performed his fourth spacewalk, pairing with NASA’s Kate Rubins to install a docking port that opened the door for Boeing and SpaceX crew capsules to visit the outpost late next year or in early 2018. They are preparing for another spacewalk next week. Williams also has helped set up a prototype habitat module designed by Bigelow Aerospace, a potential precursor to private space stations that could follow the space station. A West Point graduate in 1980, Williams later earned two master’s degrees and finished first in his class at the U.S. Naval Test Pilot School. Still, it took him about 10 years and multiple applications to win entry into NASA’s astronaut corps in 1996. He preaches perseverance to young people. Williams is old enough to remember Russia as a Cold War adversary. Now he sees the space station partnership involving the U.S., Russia, Europe, Japan and Canada as a model for peaceful international relations. USA TODAY NASA astronaut Williams to set U.S. spaceflight record “I trust that it serves as a very positive example to the world below,” he said. When he returns to Earth in less than two weeks, Williams told CBS News recently that he looks forward to seeing family and friends and to “the simple things in life.” Those include smells of Earth often taken for granted, relaxing in quiet without the station’s constant hum of fans and pumps, and anything his wife will cook for him. “She’s the real hero in all of this, putting up with me being up here that many days over the years,” he said. And Williams knows records are made to be broken. In fact, Peggy Whitson, currently fourth on NASA's career list with 377 days in space, is scheduled to launch to the International Space Station in November and set a new U.S. record next year.

Sully Speaks Out facebook twitter linkedin pinterest print By Carl von Wodtke 9/7/2016 • Aviation History Magazine, HistoryNet, Homepage Hero, Mag: Aviation History Hero The “Miracle on the Hudson” was no miracle; it was the culmination of a 35-year military and airline flying career Captain Chesley Sullenberger was the right person, in the right place, at the right time. His entire flying career had prepared him for the unimaginable crisis he and copilot Jeff Skiles faced on January 15, 2009, when their Airbus A320 lost both engines after striking a flock of geese soon after takeoff from New York’s LaGuardia Airport. The US Airways pilots were at about 3,000 feet over one of the world’s most densely populated cities, flying what was essentially a 75-ton glider with no runway within reach. In a testament to his skill and calm professionalism, Sullenberger managed to safely ditch the stricken A320 in the Hudson River, saving all 155 aboard. “Sully” Sullenberger, as he refers to himself, graciously agreed to share with Aviation History’s readers recollections of his military and airline career, the events of that fateful day seven years ago and his views on the challenges the airline industry faces today. He also talked about Sully, the Clint Eastwood–directed motion picture based on Sullenberger’s bestseller Highest Duty, starring Tom Hanks and set to be released on September 9. Tell us a little bit about how you got into flying. By the time I was 5 I knew I wanted to fly airplanes, and I never considered anything else; I didn’t have a plan B. So I was fascinated by airplanes, built my first model at probably age 5½ or 6. I had learned to fly in high school—typical pattern, soloed as soon as I could, at minimum age, at 16; got my private pilot’s certificate at the minimum age, 17; commercial pilot’s certificate at the minimum age, 18. By the time I entered the Air Force Academy, I had a couple hundred hours of flying time. I quickly became a flight instructor—by the time I was 20 I was a flight instructor in airplanes and in gliders—and in the four years I was at the Air Force Academy I flew a thousand hours, which I’m told is quite remarkable; I’m not sure it has been done since. Mostly in instruction given to other cadets, teaching them to fly airplanes and gliders on my weekends and after school. And then I went to graduate school at Purdue, then Air Force pilot training and became a fighter pilot. So it’s been something that’s been a lifelong passion and continues to be so. You had kind of a mentor in L.T. Cook. Sounded like he was the right person for you at the time. He was a cropduster that I was introduced to, and if he liked the look of you he’d take you on as a student. He did, he had his own grass strip east of Sherman, Texas. He had a couple of airplanes, one he sprayed with—a Super Cub—and then he had this Aeronca 7DC that he taught me to fly in. I soloed pretty quickly. Of course flying was a little bit simpler then. I think I had a little over 7½ hours when I soloed. It was a great way to learn deeply internalized, well-learned fundamental skills that would last a lifetime and be accessible even decades later, even though I’d been flying jets for a long time. You were named the outstanding cadet in airmanship at the Air Force Academy. To what do you attribute that honor? Well, first of all I did so much of it, both as an instructor in the glider program and in the aero club in powered airplanes. I also did parachuting, and I think just the fact I’d done so much and I had such a passion for it, it sort of set me apart from my contemporaries. That’s really it; it’s not that I was the best in every way, it’s just I had approached it with such passion and done so much of it—and been noticed. Of his time in F-4s, Sullenberger said. "It's the best flying I've ever done." (courtesy Chesley Sullenberger) You went on to fly F-4s in Britain and at Nellis Air Force Base. What did you think of the Phantom? It was an older airplane even then, a workhorse of the Vietnam era, and of course my active service was toward the end of the Vietnam War. I never actually went to Vietnam, never saw combat, and then much of the rest of my active duty service was during the Cold War. Flying a jet fighter is the pinnacle of tactical military aviation. It’s like driving a Formula One racer on steroids—in three dimensions, not just two. It’s thrilling, it’s demanding. Unless you’re someone who’s done it, words fail me in describing to you what it’s like and what it takes, except to say that it’s the best flying I’ve ever done. You need to be on at all times. Yeah, especially as we were flying in formation at ultra low levels while I was at Nellis over the desert ranges, 100 feet above the ground at 600 knots. You’re covering a nautical mile every six seconds, you’re traveling just over 1,012 feet per second. How do you think your Air Force training prepared you for Flight 1549? I think anyone who has been a military aviator brings to the table a certain discipline, a certain diligence. It’s an attitude with which we approach the job, it’s a profession, it’s a calling. And it’s something that if you answer that calling, it leads one to be a continuous lifelong learner, to constantly be striving for excellence to try to always make the next flight better than the previous one. In our military debriefings after every flight, we would not hold back, and in brutally honest discussions we would hold each other, leaders and followers alike, accountable to the same high professional standards. We talked about what worked and what didn’t, and why and what we could do to make it better next time. So it’s that sort of rigor that I think military aviators bring to any flying they do. It’s a professional attitude, to the nth degree. And you understand clearly, you’ve done your homework, there are no major gaps in your knowledge. You understand high-altitude aerodynamics, high-altitude physiology, you understand the mechanics of all the systems of the airplane, you leave no stone unturned, and you know not just what and how to do things, but you know why we must do them. And I think that’s certainly part of our National Transportation Safety Board’s formal lessons-learned process also when they investigate major transportation accidents. Pilots of my generation can quote you chapter and verse of the last half century of seminal accidents—where they occurred, why, and what we learned from them and how that knowledge has informed not only our airplane designs but our policies, our procedures and our training. Walk us through the decision-making process you went through after you struck that flock of geese and lost both engines. What were your options and why did you choose to ditch in the Hudson? Well, first I should set the stage for this and say that at this point it had been 29 years since I had been a fighter pilot. For 29 years I’d worked in this airline environment where we worked so hard to plan and anticipate and have alternatives for every course of action. We worked very hard never to be surprised by anything, to keep it smooth and routine, and we’d do a very good job of that. And very suddenly, just 100 seconds after takeoff, we encountered this flock of birds that were just visible a few seconds before we struck them. But at that point we were traveling 316 feet per second, so I saw them probably three football field lengths ahead of us, but clearly not enough time and distance to maneuver a large, fast jet airliner away from them. And so within a few seconds we had encountered an ultimate challenge of a lifetime. I’d never before been so challenged in an airplane. And within a few seconds of that the engines had been damaged and had failed, and it was obvious from the very beginning that this was going to be unlike every other flight I’d had for 42 years and 20,000 hours in the air. And the startle effect, the shock of this, was intense, and our bodies reacted in a normal human physiological way. I was aware that had happened—my pulse shooting up, my blood pressure spiking, my perceptual field narrowing because of the sudden, life-threatening stress. But I did three things. I was able to force calm on myself, which isn’t really calm, it’s just having the discipline that I talked about to be able to compartmentalize and focus clearly on the task at hand in spite of the stress. Second, even though we’d never trained for this, and in fact in our airline flight simulators you cannot train for water landings—they aren’t programmed for it; the only training we’d ever gotten was a theoretical classroom discussion—I was able to take a lifetime of experience and training and impose that paradigm on this situation, thereby making it then one I knew how to solve. And finally, because of the extreme workload and time pressure, I knew I didn’t have time to do everything I needed to do, but because I could set priorities, because I understood not just the what and how of my profession but the why, because I knew my airplane so intimately—I’d been on the airplane almost 5,000 hours, 6½ years—I could set clear priorities even in this situation we’d never trained for. And so I chose to do only the highest priority items but do them very, very well, and then I had the discipline to ignore everything I did not have time to do as being only potential distractions. I knew from having visited and flown into New York many times that we only had three options. There were only two runways that were even possibly close enough for us to be able to use our minimum altitude and glide to: LaGuardia, from which we had departed but at that point were heading away from, and Teterboro across the river in New Jersey. It turned out, and the NTSB ultimately validated this in a flight simulator study at the Airbus factory in France, that, seeing this for the first time as we were, and including reaction time, there was not altitude to make it back to any runway. And that I knew intuitively up front, and I suspected we were going to end up in the river, but I had to consider trying to make it to a runway first. I chose the third option, the only remaining viable option, which was the Hudson—the only place in the entire metropolitan area of New York, one of the most densely populated areas on the planet, that was long enough, wide enough and smooth enough to attempt landing an airliner. So I quickly set priorities, I load shed—pared down this problem to its essential elements—did the few things that had to be done, did them very well and I was willing to goal sacrifice. I knew that the highest priority was to save lives, and I was more than willing to give up trying to save the airplane very early on in order to do that. And that was an easy choice for me to make, although as [First Officer] Jeff Skiles would tell me later, “You put a $62 million airliner in the river and they call you a hero. Is this a great country, or what?” But the options were so clear. Ultimately we had the advantage of a relative lack of ambiguity. I saw the birds, we heard and felt them going into the engines. We didn’t have to spend a lot of time saying what just happened, and instead immediately started analyzing this problem. We were able to go very quickly into how do we solve it. That saved a lot of time, when we only had, as it turned out from the time we hit the birds and the thrust loss until we had landed, 208 seconds, just under 3½ minutes. So we quickly began to work together. And it’s also important to note that Jeff Skiles, like I do, has 20,000 hours of flying time. He had been a captain on the 737, a different type of airplane, before. So we were able to collaborate wordlessly, when there wasn’t time to have a discussion about this, there wasn’t time for me to direct his every action. I had to rely upon him immediately and intuitively knowing what was happening and knowing what he should do to help me, because I didn’t have time to tell him to do that. Had he been less experienced, we couldn’t have had the same outcome, and that’s why experience is so important, because you never know throughout an entire career when or even if you’re going to face such a challenge or what it will be. What’s so remarkable about this, I think, is the fact that under these extreme conditions of crisis we got so much so right so quickly, and every choice that we made at every juncture the NTSB later verified was the one that led to the best outcome. Passengers wait to be rescued on the wings of Flight 1549. (AP Photo/Steven Day) You mention in your book the Airbus A320’s various safety systems—did that in your mind help or hinder, or both, your ability to ditch in the Hudson, because I know specifically you mention about not being able to pull the nose up quite as far as you might have wanted to? The answer is both. Let me back up a little bit. Within two seconds of the bird strike and thrust loss, we know from the cockpit voice recorder and from the flight data recorder, I had taken by memory the first two remedial actions that would help us the most, that we would later get to on the checklist over a minute later, over a third of the way through the remaining flight time, and that was to turn on the engine ignition so the engines would recover if they could (it turned out they were irreparably damaged), and I started the airplane’s auxiliary power unit, the APU, to provide a backup source of electrical power. Since this is a fly-by-wire airplane and there’s no longer a direct mechanical connection with the flight controls, instead you have electrical impulses that are fed through computers that then move actuators. So I knew how important it was to have uninterrupted electrical power, and we never lost electrical power. By the time the left engine rpm decayed enough that it was no longer powering its own generator, the APU generator was online. So we stayed in normal law—all the flight envelope protections were intact. That helped provide essentially guardrails to prevent us from exceeding certain extremes in terms of speed or attitude, for example. So I had that as an ace in the hole. It turns out we didn’t need those protections; we never got to the limits at which they would have protected us from ourselves. At the very end of the flight, as you note, I had not yet achieved the maximum aerodynamic performance of the wing—we had not yet gotten to what we call alpha max—and I was during the landing pulling the stick further aft, further aft, trying to maximize the performance of the wing to get to the nose-high attitude we needed for entry into the water, to get to the slowest rate of descent that we could. And it turned out we discovered later—the investigators discovered by studying the data from the digital flight data recorder—that in the last four seconds of the flight, a little-known software feature of the fly-by-wire system known only to a few software engineers at Airbus, but to no airline pilots and no airline operators, prevented me from achieving that last little bit of performance because of something called the phugoid mode. And had that not inhibited our performance, had that not, as the NTSB in the report euphemistically said, “attenuated” my inputs—nose-up command—we wouldn’t have hit quite so hard, we wouldn’t have had as much damage and [Flight Attendant] Doreen Welsh might not have been injured in the back when a piece of structure came up through the floor, and the airplane might have floated a little bit higher in the water and a little bit longer. So it’s a mixed blessing: It prevented us from making egregious errors, but we didn’t anyway, and at the very end it prevented us from getting the nose up quite as much as we theoretically should have been able to. How do you think it might have been different if you were, say, flying a Boeing airliner? Except for that one flight control mode, I don’t think it would have mattered. As long as I was flying an airplane that was similarly configured, in other words the overall geometric structure of the airplane was similar, with low-slung engines in about the same position, I think we would have had a similar outcome. To what do you attribute the public fascination with your successful ditching? I think just the way it happened, when it happened at the time in the world’s history, during the ’08-’09 financial meltdown when it seemed as if everything was going wrong and no one could do anything right. It had affected so many people so negatively that some people had begun to question human nature and wonder if it was really mostly about self-interest and greed. And then this group of people all came together, rose to the occasion and in concert made it their mission in life to see that good was done and that lives were saved. I think at a time when we all needed it, it gave people hope, it reassured us that there was still this human potential for good in each of us. And I think one of the biggest surprises for all of us directly involved is that this story did not fade away at the end of the news cycle like most stories do, because of the way it happened when it happened and the way that it continues to touch and inspire people, even people not associated with this flight. And so I feel a special responsibility to this story to treat it with the respect that I feel for it, because of the way it touches people. From left: Sully, First Officer Jeffrey Skiles and Flight Attendants Donna Dent, Doreen Welsh and Sheila Dail meet with New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg on February 9, 2009, to receive the keys to the city. (AP Photo/Stephen Chernin) And the people of New York, too, were part of that whole equation. Absolutely. So as a result of this, both our first officer Jeff Skiles and I feel an obligation to use this notoriety for good, to use this bully pulpit to improve the safety of the traveling public, to improve the state of the piloting profession. Not to do so would be a dereliction of duty in our minds, because we feel like we owe it to our colleagues still working at all the airlines to do that. Since we’ve been chosen temporarily by fate as the de facto spokespersons for the profession, we don’t want to let them down. Tell us a little bit about what you’ve been up to since your 2009 book. A lot. People know that a year after the famous flight I retired after just over 30 years from the airlines, but they don’t always know all the things I’ve done, that I really didn’t retire; I just traded that one profession for several others. As an author I wrote a second book, Making a Difference: Stories of Vision and Courage From America’s Leaders, that I’m very happy with. I profile about a dozen people, and when I chose people whom I admired to profile as exemplars of leadership, I neither asked nor considered their political affiliation, but instead I chose people who had exhibited moral courage, and by doing the right thing at the right time for the right reasons, they had made a difference in people’s lives. And so that’s something I’ve been passionate about my whole life, and I was very fortunate to have so many outstanding Americans participate in this story and come up with answers to all the questions I had about leadership—like are leaders born or made, how important is culture, how do you manage your own ego and prevent it from getting in your way? So that was a real labor of love, and that came out in 2012. I’ve been doing a lot of speeches around the country and in fact around the world. I’ve talked to audiences, as many as 15,000 people, from Australia to Switzerland and everywhere in between. And as I’ve traveled the world and met important people, including some world leaders, I’ve learned a lot about different audiences, and I work very hard to do that every time I speak to them—audiences as diverse as nuclear power operators to financial risk managers to medical professionals. I’ve done a lot of talking to medical audiences about how we’ve made aviation so safe and the ways that we can transfer that knowledge to medicine to make patient care safer. I’ve also been a consultant to industry, again on applying aviation-type methods to chemical and other industries. And I’ve also been an advocate for the safety of the traveling public; I’ve used this notoriety for good to go to Capitol Hill. I testified just a year ago before the House and the Senate aviation subcommittees. I was in Washington, D.C., just last month to try to improve aviation safety and try to include in the FAA reauthorization bill measures that would make flying safer for everybody. So that’s a big focus of mine. So I’ve been very busy in trying to say that even though I had a 40-year career in flying—even before the famous flight, and then there was the famous flight, which was a major contribution to safety—I’m trying to keep on working so that it may be that if I’m fortunate and work hard enough, my greatest contributions still lie ahead. What do you think are the main challenges the airline industry faces today? I think the main challenge is to find ways to keep making air travel safer. We’ve made huge strides, particularly in the advanced Western world and especially in the United States in the last decade. In fact, the last passenger fatality on a large U.S. jetliner in the U.S. was 15 years ago, in November 2001. That’s not true at the regionals, although the last regional airline accident now has been awhile—the February 2009 crash of Continental Connection–Colgan Air 3407 in Buffalo. It’s been largely due to the efforts of the victims’ families of the Buffalo crash, because of their ardent support for safety measures, that the Congress in 2010 really improved some things, including pilot experience minimums that were really very low before and now are more reasonable. So there’s still a lot of pressure, especially within the regional industry, to do things that are just good enough, to do things that are less costly, that are more expedient, that are easier. And we have to keep reminding everyone—the airlines, the FAA and others—that when we go up in an airliner together, what we’re really doing, in spite of how routine and safe it seems, is we’re pushing a tube filled with people through the upper atmosphere, 7 or 8 miles above the earth, at 80 percent of the speed of sound, in a hostile environment with outside air pressure one-quarter that at the surface and outside temperatures to minus 70, and we must return it safely to the surface every time. We make it look easy, but it’s not. So we can’t take our eye off the ball. We have to use big data, we have to use all kinds of safety reporting and auditing systems to look for risks and mitigate them before they can lead to a bad outcome. And we need to make sure that as we transition from my generation of pilots to the next generations that they have that same diligence, that same discipline, that same understanding that just good enough isn’t, and that they have learned and internalized the lessons of historic accidents to remember why it’s important that we do all the things we do to keep our passengers safe on every flight on every day. What is your opinion of the airline pilot shortage, and why do you think fewer youngsters are interested in learning to fly? Well, all of us choose our life path based upon not only our passion but its ability to be a viable, sustainable path for ourselves and eventually for our families. Your passion only carries you so far. At some point all of us are going to want to be able to have the means to buy a car, to get married, to buy a house—to have a path that makes economic sense for us. And if the entry-level wages and working conditions and benefits of some of these small regional airlines are not sufficient to do that, of course they’re not going to attract experienced applicants in the numbers they would like. There isn’t currently a shortage of pilots in this country, but there is a shortage of pilots willing to work for starvation, food-stamp-level wages at some of the smallest carriers that have a rightly deserved reputation for being not good places to work. And so I think the industry as a whole needs to look at this broken economic model that some of the regional airlines continue to try to use, and some of the large major carriers have helped to create because they have created a system in which the smaller regionals compete on the basis of cost to be their regional affiliate. In other words, the large major carriers often choose the lowest bidder to be their affiliate in a region, and so I think they’ve helped to create the problem and they have a responsibility in helping to fix it. How about the increasing reliance on automation—do you think there’s been an erosion in airline piloting skills? I not only think that, but studies have indicated that. And it’s even worse than that. There have been several studies that have shown that not only has overreliance on automation given pilots fewer opportunities to manually practice flying skills, and that their flying skills have somewhat eroded because of that, but even worse, these studies have found that being an observer, a monitor of automated systems flying the airplane during large portions of the flight, has eroded the pilots’ ability to be mentally engaged, keep track of what’s happening with the airplane and respond quickly enough and effectively enough when they need to intervene. So it’s sapped their flying skills, it’s sapped the confidence they have in their manual flying skills, and it’s slowed their willingness and their ability to quickly and effectively intervene when they must exercise their flying skills, and instead keep on trying to use or fix the automation. So this lack of ability to quickly analyze and figure out what’s going on because of this mentally taking a step back and not being as actively mentally engaged with the whole process throughout the flight is what troubles me even more than the lack of or the diminution of manual flying skills. But they go hand in hand. And so we need to find better ways to keep pilots sharp, to keep them engaged in every aspect of the flight. And it may mean that we need to rethink the design of our cockpits to give pilots a more active role, and have the automation do more of the monitoring instead of the reverse, because humans are not inherently good at monitoring. A lot of people consider you a hero, and in your book you said you’re not comfortable with that. How do you feel about that now? Well, I’ve spent years coming to terms with that. And I’ve gotten a greater appreciation for people’s need to feel that way. And I take it as a real responsibility for me to be the public face of this event, and to receive people’s thanks because they have a need to give it. And I want to honor that, but at the same time I know that while we were doing our jobs that day, we did our jobs exceptionally well, probably better than could have been expected under the circumstances.   Sully: The Movie Director Clint Eastwood and Tom Hanks discuss a scene on location in New York City. (Photo by Steve Sands/GC Images) When did you learn that they wanted to make a movie from your book, and what was your reaction? Well it was in 2010 that I was approached by a producer who optioned the dramatic rights to my first book, Highest Duty: My Search for What Really Matters, and she hired a screenwriter and came up with a script. And then it had not found a home until early May 2015, when the script was read by Clint Eastwood and he loved it. He immediately contacted Warner Bros, and the train left the station and has been hurtling down the tracks ever since. He actually came to the house last May [2015], and then once some of the casting decisions were made Tom Hanks came to the house last summer. Principal photography began in New York in late September, and it was all completed by late November or early December. And of course it’s in post-production now and it will be released in theaters in the U.S. on September 9. So the story has found a good home, it’s in good hands—veteran filmmakers and great storytellers. And of course Tom Hanks is our “everyman,” he’s played a lot of real people before, including people I’ve met, like Captain James Lovell of Apollo 13, so we’re looking forward to it. How does it feel to have America’s everyman actor playing you? Well, Jimmy Stewart wasn’t available [laughter]. I think it’s a great choice. What’s the nature of your involvement? I’ve had a small role as a consultant on the film, which I’m very glad, because, I mean, it’s my life and the life of my family and the lives of the people on our flight. So this obviously matters to me. And I’m really impressed with the way that they’re handling it. The few times my wife and I had a chance to visit on the set during filming, it seemed like everybody in the cast and crew, and there were sometimes hundreds of people there, treated this with the kind of respect that I really was impressed by. What’s it been like working with a Hollywood legend like Clint Eastwood? It must be a privilege. It is. Class act, very dedicated, been doing this a long time. Very successful coming off the heels just a year ago with American Sniper. And he’s got a well-earned reputation for being very efficient and getting it done quickly, on time and under budget. And taking good care of the story.

When NASA astronaut Jeff Williams returned to Earth from the International Space Station on Sept. 6, he had been in space for 172 days. Adding those days to his three previous space flights, Williams has spent a total of 534 days off the planet, the longest for a NASA astronaut. The previous record holder, Scott Kelly, logged a three-flight total of 520 days.

Over the weekend Israeli company Space Communication (or Spacecom) threatened to go after SpaceX for $50 million or a free flight after SpaceX blew up the Spacecom satellite that was on board the ill-fated rocket, Reuters reported. Spacecom shares dropped 9 percent after the explosion, and its equity was expected to drop by $30 million, according to the report. And the fiery disaster may have cost Spacecom its planned $285 sale to Chinese company Xinwei Technology Group — a deal that hinged on the successful launch of that Amos-6 communications satellite, The New York Times reported. Facebook was going to use the satellite as part of its plan to bring low-cost internet access to less-developed countries. The explosion comes as space travel is increasingly becoming a commercial venture, and private companies are vying to edge into the field that previously was controlled exclusively by NASA, the military and other government programs. Experts say last Thursday s bust could set back these efforts. NASA ended its shuttle program in 2011 and since then U.S. astronauts and equipment have hitched rides into space on Russian vehicles. NASA had expected to resume launching with U.S.-made boosters and capsules from SpaceX and Boeing in less than two years, The Wall Street Journal reported, but the explosion — coupled with other setbacks — could delay the process and force the U.S. to buy more seats on Russian rockets. SpaceX has said it s investigating the cause of the explosion. The blow-up damaged its launch site in Cape Canaveral, Florida. SpaceX s business is robust, with approximately 70 missions on our manifest worth over $10 billion, the company wrote in an online post after the explosion, which it referred to as an anomaly. Meanwhile, a SpaceX explosion conspiracy theory has surfaced. In video of the event, a small object can be seen flying overhead just before the rocket is consumed by a fireball. Some on the internet say the object is a UFO, while others theorize it s a government drone that fired a projectile and blew up the rocket. Or … it may have been a bird.

Credit: NASA/Bill Ingalls Less than a week after winding up a successful spacewalk, outgoing space station commander Jeff Williams, America’s most experienced astronaut, joined two Russian cosmonauts for a fiery return to Earth Tuesday, closing out a 172-day mission with an on-target landing in Kazakhstan. Descending under a billowing orange-and-white parachute, the charred Soyuz crew module completed a jolting rocket-assisted touchdown at 9:13 p.m. EDT (GMT-4; 7:13 a.m. Wednesday local time). As sometimes happens, the capsule tipped over on its side after landing, but Russian recovery crews stationed nearby were on the scene in minutes to tilt the spacecraft upright and to help the station fliers, getting their first taste of gravity in five-and-a-half months, out of the cramped compartment. Williams, Soyuz commander Alexey Ovchinin and flight engineer Oleg Skripochka appeared healthy and in good spirits as they were carried out of the descent module and set down in recliners for satellite phone calls home while flight surgeons carried out quick medical checks. All three were scheduled to fly by helicopter to Karaganda later in the day. From there, Williams was to board a NASA jet for the long flight back home to Houston while Ovchinin and Skripochka planned to head for Star City near Moscow for debriefing and reunions with family members. “I will certainly miss this view!” Williams tweeted from the station early Tuesday, sending down a photo of Earth’s limb in brilliant sunlight. “Vast gratitude toward my crewmates, ground teams, supporting friends, and family.” “We’ve enjoyed a great stay up here over the last five-and-a-half months,” he said earlier. “This is a very significant time, in my opinion, in the life of the space station, going into the full utilization mode, being the orbiting laboratory we’ve always said it was going to be.” Williams, Ovchinin and Skripochka undocked from the lab’s upper Poisk module at 5:51 p.m., slowly backing away as the two spacecraft passed more than 250 miles above the western Pacific Ocean. Looking on from inside the station were Expedition 49 commander Anatoly Ivanishin, Japanese astronaut Takuya Onishi and NASA astronaut Kate Rubins. Launched to the station July 6 aboard the Soyuz MS-01 spacecraft, Ivanishin and his crewmates will have the space lab to themselves until Sept. 25 when three fresh crew members arrive. “We’ll be missing you here,” Ivanishin said Monday during a change-of-command ceremony. “Have fun riding though the atmosphere, enjoy seeing plasma in the windows and have a very safe, and exceptionally soft, landing. All the best.” After making sure the Soyuz TMA-20M spacecraft was ready for its descent, Ovchinin, flanked on the left by Skripochka and on the right by Williams, monitored a computer controlled de-orbit rocket firing starting at 8:21 p.m. The four-minute 41-second burn slowed the ship by 286 mph, just enough to drop the far side of the orbit deep into Earth’s atmosphere. After a 25-minute free fall to just above the top of the discernible atmosphere, the three modules making up the Soyuz TMA-20M spacecraft separated. A few moments after that, the central crew cabin, the only module protected by a heat shield, slammed into the atmosphere at an altitude of 62 miles and a velocity of some 17,000 mph. Rubins managed to capture a photograph of re-entry from her vantage point aboard the station, showing the central crew module descending as a point of light while the discarded upper and lower compartments burned up in in the atmosphere as planned, leaving long streaks of flaming debris in their wake. NASA astronaut Jeff Williams, Soyuz commander Alexey Ovchinin and flight engineer Oleg Skripochka were greeted on the Kazakh steppe by Russian and U.S. recovery crews. Credit: NASA/Bill Ingalls The crew module dropped out of the plasma heating zone in good shape and its main parachute deployed at an altitude of a little less than seven miles. The spacecraft then slowly settled to the steppe of Kazakhstan. Asked what he was looking forward to the most, Williams said “obviously, family is the first thing, my wife, she’s the real hero in all this putting up with me being up here that many days.” “I look forward to quiet, just relaxing someplace, enjoying the views, enjoying the smells of Earth, all those things that we normally take for granted,” he told CBS News last month. “You miss that when you’re up here. We have continuous noise up here from fans and pumps, it’s not loud, but it’s continuous.” All in all, he said, “just the simple things in life. Good food, anything my wife wants to cook, I look forward to that, those kinds of things, friends.” Williams and his two crewmates were launched from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on March 18 and landing closes out a busy increment highlighted by two spacewalks, the arrival of two Russian Progress cargo ships, a pair of SpaceX Dragon freighters, an Orbital ATK Cygnus supply craft and the Soyuz MS-01 crew. During a spacewalk Aug. 19, Williams and Rubins attached a new docking mechanism to the front of the station that will allow new commercial crew ferry ships being built by Boeing and SpaceX to dock at the lab complex, ending NASA’s sole reliance on Russia’s Soyuz for transportation. During a second spacewalk last Thursday, Rubins and Williams, making his fifth EVA overall, retracted a cooling radiator, installed two high-definition cameras and performed other routine maintenance. The two astronauts logged 12 hours and 46 minutes during the two excursions, pushing Williams’ overall total through five EVAs to 31 hours and 55 minutes. Those spacewalks cover much of the history of the International Space Station with his first excursion coming during a shuttle maintenance mission in May 2000. He then ventured outside a second time with a Russian cosmonaut in June 2006 to perform maintenance on the Russian segment of the station. Two months after that, he went back outside with a European Space Agency astronaut to work on the station’s cooling system. Williams served as commander of Expedition 22 during his second long-duration stay aboard the lab and again as commander of Expedition 48 during this most recent mission. With touchdown, Ovchinin, completing his first space flight, logged 172 days in space while flight engineer Skripochka’s record over two flights now stands at 331 days. For Williams, the end of the mission marked a personal milestone. On Aug. 20, he surpassed the U.S. record for most cumulative time in space — 520 days — that was set earlier this year by astronaut Scott Kelly at the end of his nearly yearlong mission. With landing Tuesday, Williams’ mark now stands at 534 days aloft over four missions, moving him up to 14th on the list of most experienced spacemen. The overall record is held by Gennady Padalka, who has logged 878 days in space over five missions. “I appreciate, Jeff, your efforts as space station commander,” Ivanishin said during the change-of-command ceremony. “I’ll take care of the crew and the station. And I promise you, when you return to celebrate your first 1,000 days in space, the station will be in better shape!” Williams, Ovchinin and Skripochka will be replaced aboard the station by the Soyuz MS-02 crew, scheduled for launch from Baikonur on Sept. 23. After a two-day rendezvous, vehicle commander Andrey Borisenko, flight engineer Sergey Ryzhikov and NASA astronaut Shane Kimbrough will dock at the Poisk module to boost the lab’s crew back to six. Ivanishin, Onishi and Rubins are scheduled to return to Earth Oct. 30.

Here are the details from that article: Provincial Aerospace Ltd. and CarteNav Solutions Inc. have entered into an agreement under which PAL has acquired CarteNav. CarteNav is a Nova Scotia based software developer that provides situational awareness and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance solutions for maritime, land, and air environments. Its flagship product is AIMS-ISR which is being used in more than 30 countries around the world, the two firms pointed out in their news release. “There are many synergies between our two companies as we are each leaders in our specific segments of the ISR market,” Brian Chafe, Chief Executive Officer, PAL Aerospace, noted in a statement. “Together we look forward to enhancing the product and service offerings we are each able to offer.” Top Aces Corp. says it recently completed German Army Joint Terminal Attack Controller (JTAC) training support. Top Aces TA-4J Skyhawks flew multiple sorties and successfully completed all scheduled JTAC training events for German Army personnel on training ranges near Boise, Idaho, the firm added. Directed by controllers, Top Aces says its pilots flew close air support missions, simulating the delivery of munitions in close proximity to friendly forces. Rheinmetall will supply the Royal Canadian Navy with decoy ammunition for the next thirty years Rheinmetall and General Dynamics Ordnance and Tactical Systems–Canada have recently signed a licence agreement to produce Omnitrap decoy ammunition for the RCN. The contract encompasses the supply of core components by Rheinmetall for Omnitrap decoy ammunition, the company’s news release pointed out. Rheinmetall will provide technical assistance in setting up the assembly line at the General Dynamics facility in Repentigny, Que., where final assembly will take place. Rheinmetall pointed out that in 2009 it won a contract to outfit twelve Canadian Halifax-class frigates with MASS, the Multi Ammunition Softkill System, an automated decoy system which offers protection against incoming anti-ship missiles. Most Canadian Halifax-class frigates have been equipped with MASS systems along with a basic load of Omnitrap and MASS Dueras decoy ammunition, the firm noted. In 2015, Canada placed an order for 2,450 Omnitrap decoy rounds with Rheinmetall and General Dynamics Ordnance and Tactical Systems–Canada. The newly signed agreement will continue this supply relationship as well as the support that both companies provide the Canadian government for the next 30 years, according to Rheinmetall. Field Aviation says it has delivered the third of four missionized Challenger aircraft to Cobham Aviation Services. These aircraft are to provide enhanced search and rescue capabilities in support of the Australian Maritime Safety Authority’s (AMSA) operations, according to Field Aviation. The firm noted that it designed, installed, flight tested, and certified structural, electrical and aerodynamic changes to the aircraft. Esterline CMC Electronics (CMC) has been awarded a contract by Pilatus Aircraft Ltd to supply its cockpit avionics for eight PC-21 turboprop trainer aircraft. Those planes are for the Royal Jordanian Air Force. Esterline CMC said it will supply the cockpit displays, dual flight management systems (FMS) and GPS Global Positioning System (GPS) landing system sensors as well as the head-up display (HUD) sub-system. Esterline CMC Electronics (CMC) has also been awarded a contract by Pilatus Aircraft Ltd to supply its advanced cockpit avionics for the Royal Australian Air Force fleet of forty-nine PC-21 turboprop trainer aircraft. The Canadian government has awarded Lockheed Martin a $14.5 million contract to provide long-term, support for the Submarine Fire Control System (SFCS) installed on all four Victoria-class submarines and land based team trainers. The scope of the contract will contain in service and field service support, obsolescence management, and technical investigations as requested by the Department of National Defence, according to Lockheed Martin. The work on this program will be conducted at Lockheed Martin’s facilities in Manassas, Virginia and Dartmouth, Nova Scotia, and via field service support at Canadian forces bases Halifax and Esquimalt. Boeing will be supplying more Apache helicopter to the United Kingdom. A deal was signed that will see Boeing deliver 50 AH-64E Apache attack helicopters to the British Army. The first helicopters will be built by 2020. Flight operations with the British Army would begin two years later. In addition, in early June, the U.S. government announced that Qatar will acquire 24 AH-64E Apache helicopters. Boeing also received in April a significant contract from the U.S. Army. That will see 117 AH-64D Apaches remanufactured to the new AH-64E model. The agreement, which also includes the acquisition of Longbow Crew Trainers, logistical support and spares, carries a total contract value of about $1.5 billion U.S., according to Boeing. That work is being done at the Apache production facility in Mesa, Arizona. The work will be completed in May 2018. Jesse Farrington, senior manager for Apache global sales and marketing, told Esprit de Corps earlier this year during a tour of the Mesa facilities, that the U.S. has made it clear it has a long-term commitment to the Apache. “Right now the U.S. Army is saying that they will be flying these aircraft to 2060,” he explained. “Customers around the world will benefit from that.”   Canadian bomb disposal specialists taking part in operation at Guadalcanal Spanish supply ship back on east coast to help Royal Canadian...

NASA Tests New Insulation for SLS Rocket by Kim Henry for MSFC News Huntsville AL (SPX) Sep 07, 2016 Amy Buck, SLS core stage insight lead at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama, holds up a sample of foam that recently went through testing in Marshall's Hot Gas Facility. The facility is used for development and qualification of material systems for use on launch vehicles, like NASA's Space Launch System. These foam panels were tested to determine recession characteristics of the foam during the ascent phase of flight. The surface of the foam reaches more than 500 degrees Fahrenheit as it undergoes a hot gas flow at speeds of up to Mach 4 to simulate the environment during launch. NASA engineers then take the samples and measure how much foam is lost during the test to characterize the materials for use in the launch vehicle design and analysis. Image courtesy NASA/MSFC/Emmett Given. For a larger version of this image please go here. You may not think about insulation much, but it's one of those unsung industry heroes that keeps our drinks cold and homes warm on those bone-chilling winter days. Insulation also is a key component to protecting NASA's Space Launch System and its super-cold fuels for the journey to Mars. Different types of cryogenic foam - used for very low temperatures - will insulate the rocket's core stage and launch vehicle stage adapter, which connects the core stage to the interim cryogenic propulsion stage (ICPS). The core stage is the backbone of the rocket, and houses the avionics system, propellant and RS-25 engines. On the first flight of SLS with the Orion spacecraft, called Exploration Mission-1, the ICPS will give the Orion the big push needed to fly beyond the moon before the spacecraft returns to Earth. The rocket's fuel is comprised of liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen. Liquid hydrogen is cooled to -423 degrees Fahrenheit, and the liquid oxygen is cooled to -297 degrees Fahrenheit. Insulation protects the outside of the core stage from ice build-up resulting from the subzero propellants inside the aluminum walls. Insulation also reduces heat flow to the propellants, hardware and flight systems during launch and atmospheric re-entry. So, what kind of insulation materials can measure up for the world's most powerful rocket? Engineers at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama, are peeling back the layers to find out. "NASA has developed new, more environmentally friendly insulation materials for future launch vehicles," said Michael Frazier, nonmetallic materials branch chief at the Marshall Center. "The cryoinsulation materials for SLS are not only more environmentally compliant, but they are also just as efficient and lightweight as the previous generation of materials." Three types of foam have been developed and are being tested for SLS. The foams are all closed-cell materials, which means they are stronger and have greater resistance to heat flow and moisture. They also are non-ozone-depleting and flame resistant. The different types of insulation are applied by varying methods: automatically by a robot; manually using a hand-held spray system; and hand mixed for pouring into molds. "With some parts of the rocket being so massive, like the core stage, robotic applications help reduce time and manpower with more control and continuous sprays," said Amy Buck, SLS core stage insight lead. The thickness of the insulation varies depending on the hardware, but it is typically about one inch. Hundreds of 24-by-24-inch panels have been covered with the three types of foam for a variety of tests, which are being conducted by NASA and prime contractor Boeing, headquartered in Chicago, to qualify the insulation for the challenging environments SLS will experience before and during flight. Tests range from density measurements to exposing the foams to heating environments similar to those the SLS will see during ascent. Qualification testing of all the foam systems is anticipated to be completed later this year. At that point, the materials will be ready to use on Exploration Mission-1 in late 2018. "There are some follow-on aging tests that we will run over the next few years, but those are just being done to ensure we don't have any problems with long-term storage of the cured-foam products," Frazier said. So the next time you reach for a drink inside your cooler or shed the cold of winter in your home, think about another type of insulator that will be headed to deep space. The initial SLS configuration, known as Block 1, will have a minimum 70-metric-ton (77-ton) lift capability. The next planned upgrade of SLS, Block 1B, will use a more powerful exploration upper stage for more ambitious missions with a 105-metric-ton (115-ton) lift capacity. Block 2 will add a pair of advanced solid or liquid propellant boosters to provide a 130-metric-ton (143-ton) lift capacity. In each configuration, SLS will continue to use the same core stage and four RS-25 engines.

Nasa's Jeff Williams, 58, logged 534 days in space over four missions. The ISS commander landed at 7:13 local time (0113 GMT) on the steppes of central Kazakhstan aboard a Russian-made Soyuz capsule along with Alexey Ovchinin and Oleg Skripochka. "Touchdown! Welcome home @Astro_Jeff, officially back on Earth after 172-day mission & total 534 days on 4 missions," Nasa tweeted. A Nasa live video feed showed Williams on the ground smiling and waving while talking on a satellite phone before being carried away for medical tests. The three men undocked from the ISS nearly three and a half hours earlier after spending their mission largely conducting scientific experiments.Williams performed five space walks, including one along with Nasa astronaut Kate Rubins to install a docking adapter for future commercial Boeing and SpaceX crew capsules to visit the space station. "Williams was instrumental in preparing the station for the future arrival of US commercial crew spacecraft," Nasa said in a statement. He also helped set up an experimental temporary inflatable module designed by Bigelow Aerospace to test expandable habitats astronauts might use on the Moon or Mars in the coming decades. The retired Army colonel beat the previous US record set by astronaut Scott Kelly during his year in orbit. Kelly has 520 days in space over his career. Williams, a grandfather, is also the oldest American to spend live on the space station. Williams first blasted to space aboard the shuttle Atlantis in 2000. He returned to the International Space Station in 2006 when the space station was far smaller - with just two modules and three crew members - and again in 2009. Today, the ISS is staffed by six astronauts and cosmonauts and spans the size of a football field. Williams may hold the US record for time in orbit, but Russia's Gennady Padalka still holds the record for the person with the most cumulative days in space at 879.

QRZ Callsign Search  Page last updated on: Wednesday, September 7, 2016 NASA’s record-breaking astronaut, crewmates safely return to Earth NASA astronaut and Expedition 48 Commander Jeff Williams, KD5TVQ returned to Earth Tuesday after his U.S. record-breaking mission aboard the International Space Station. Williams and his Russian crewmates Alexey Ovchinin and Oleg Skripochka, RN3FU, of the Russian space agency Roscosmos, landed in their Soyuz TMA-20M at 9:13 p.m. EDT southeast of the remote town of Dzhezkazgan in Kazakhstan (7:13 a.m. Sept. 7, local time). Having completed his fourth mission, Williams now has spent 534 days in space, making him first on the all-time NASA astronaut list. Skripochka now has 331 days in space on two flights, while Ovchinin spent 172 days in space on his first. “No other U.S. astronaut has Jeff’s time and experience aboard the International Space Station. From his first flight in 2000, when the station was still under construction, to present day where the focus is science, technology development and fostering commercialization. Jeff even helped prepare the space station for future dockings of commercial spacecraft under NASA’s Commercial Crew Program,” said Kirk Shireman, ISS Program manager at NASA’s Johnson Space Center in Houston. “We’re incredibly proud of what Jeff has accomplished off the Earth for the Earth.” Williams was instrumental in preparing the station for the future arrival of U.S. commercial crew spacecraft. The first International Docking Adapter was installed during a spacewalk by Williams and fellow NASA astronaut Kate Rubins Aug. 19. Outfitted with a host of sensors and systems, the adapter’s main purpose is to connect spacecraft bringing astronauts to the station in the future. Its first users are expected to be Boeing’s CST-100 Starliner and SpaceX’s Crew Dragon spacecraft, now in development in partnership with NASA. During his time on the orbital complex, Williams ventured outside the confines of the space station for a second spacewalk with Rubins to retract a spare thermal control radiator and install two new high-definition cameras.  Together, the Expedition 48 crew members contributed to hundreds of experiments in biology, biotechnology, physical science and Earth science aboard humanity’s only orbiting laboratory. The crew members also welcomed five cargo spacecraft during their stay. Williams was involved in the grapple of Orbital ATK’s Cygnus spacecraft in March, the company's fourth commercial resupply mission, and SpaceX’s eighth Dragon spacecraft cargo delivery in April, and welcomed a second Dragon delivery in July. Two Russian ISS Progress cargo craft also docked to the station in April and July delivering tons of supplies. Expedition 49 continues operating the station with Anatoly Ivanishin of Roscosmos in command. He, Rubins, and Takuya Onishi of the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, will operate the station for more than two weeks until the arrival of three new crew members. Shane Kimbrough of NASA and cosmonauts Sergey Ryzhikov and Andrey Borisenko of Roscosmos are scheduled to launch Sept. 23, U.S. time, from Baikonur, Kazakhstan.

He returned to the International Space Station in 2006 when the space station was far smaller -- with just two modules and three crew members -- and again in 2009. Today, the ISS is staffed by six astronauts and cosmonauts and spans the size of a football field. Williams may hold the US record for time in orbit, but Russia's Gennady Padalka still holds the record for the person with the most cumulative days in space at 879.

By: Reuters | Beijing | Published:September 7, 2016 1:59 pm Passenger plane China’s long-delayed C919 jet may make its maiden flight by the end of this year, state-owned planemaker Commercial Aircraft Corp of China Ltd (COMAC) said on Wednesday. “We are working hard to achieve our maiden voyage by around the end of 2016,” Lu Zheng, COMAC’s deputy head of marketing, said at a press conference in Beijing. The C919 narrowbody jet is currently undergoing rigorous testing and is the first large-scale Chinese civilian plane developed in accordance with international test-flight standards, Lu said. China is keen to establish itself as a global supplier of aircraft and it hopes the C919 will compete with Boeing Co’s 737 and Airbus Group SE’s A320. It also plans to produce a larger widebody plane in a joint venture with Russia. However, it has been held back by inexperience, a shortage of local aerospace design and engineering talent, as well as a lack of home-grown companies with the technology to help drive the project, say aerospace industry sources familiar with its programmes. The challenges have led to multiple delays for the C919, as well as the ARJ-21 which made its maiden commercial flight in June.

 SpaceX and NASA have released full statements about Thursday's rocket explosion — here's what they said Dave Mosher Sep. 3, 2016, 11:45 AM 107,565 facebook linkedin twitter email print Elon Musk, the founder of SpaceX, left, and the September 1 explosion of a Falcon 9 rocket, right, in Cape Canaveral, Florida. Max Whitaker/Getty Images; USLaunchReport.com; Business Insider More than a day after the fiery explosion of a Falcon 9 rocket on a launchpad in Cape Canaveral, Florida, both SpaceX and NASA have issued full statements. The rocket catastrophically blew up at a launchpad called Space Launch Center 40 (SLC-40) at 9:07 a.m. on September 1, right before a routine engine-firing test. Although no one was hurt during the blast, Facebook's $200 million Amos-6 satellite — bound to provide internet service to the developing world — was utterly destroyed. The blast reportedly shattered windows nearby, knocked sliding doors off peoples' homes farther away, and was heard as far as 30 miles from SLC-40, according to local Florida TV stations. The cause of the mishap isn't known at this time, and experts say it will hamper the ambitious launch schedule planned by aerospace company, which is owned by entrepreneur Elon Musk. SpaceX's statement SpaceX's launch Pad 39A in Cape Canaveral, Florida. SpaceX/Flickr Business Insider contacted representatives at SpaceX about the nature of the explosion, damage to SLC-40, and the event's potential impact to the company's launch plans. After issuing brief statements through Twitter, they provided us with the full statement below on Friday evening, more than 33 hours after the blast. We've replaced instances of "anomaly" with "explosion" for easier reading and emphasized certain parts in bold: "SpaceX has begun the careful and deliberate process of understanding the causes and fixes for yesterday's incident. We will continue to provide regular updates on our progress and findings, to the fullest extent we can share publicly. "We deeply regret the loss of AMOS-6, and safely and reliably returning to flight to meet the demands of our customers is our chief priority. SpaceX's business is robust, with approximately 70 missions on our manifest worth over $10 billion. In the aftermath of yesterday's events, we are grateful for the continued support and unwavering confidence that our commercial customers as well as NASA and the United States Air Force have placed in us. "Overview of the incident: Yesterday, at SpaceX's Launch Complex 40 at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, an [explosion] took place about eight minutes in advance of a scheduled test firing of a Falcon 9 rocket. The [explosion] on the pad resulted in the loss of the vehicle. This was part of a standard pre-launch static fire to demonstrate the health of the vehicle prior to an eventual launch. At the time of the loss, the launch vehicle was vertical and in the process of being fueled for the test. At this time, the data indicates the [explosion] originated around the upper stage liquid oxygen tank. Per standard operating procedure, all personnel were clear of the pad. There were no injuries. "To identify the root cause of the [explosion], SpaceX began its investigation immediately after the loss, consistent with accident investigation plans prepared for such a contingency. These plans include the preservation of all possible evidence and the assembly of an Accident Investigation Team, with oversight by the Federal Aviation Administration and participation by NASA, the United States Air Force and other industry experts. We are currently in the early process of reviewing approximately 3000 channels of telemetry and video data covering a time period of just 35-55 milliseconds. "As for the Launch Pad itself, our teams are now investigating the status of SLC-40. The pad clearly incurred damage, but the scope has yet to be fully determined. We will share more data as it becomes available. SpaceX currently operates 3 launch pads – 2 in Florida and 1 in California at Vandenberg Air Force Base. SpaceX's other launch sites were not affected by yesterday's events. Space Launch Complex 4E at Vandenberg Air Force Base is in the final stages of an operational upgrade and Launch Complex 39A at Kennedy Space Center remains on schedule to be operational in November. Both pads are capable of supporting Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy launches. We are confident the two launch pads can support our return to flight and fulfill our upcoming manifest needs. "Again, our number one priority is to safely and reliably return to flight for our customers, as well as to take all the necessary steps to ensure the highest possible levels of safety for future crewed missions with the Falcon 9. We will carefully and thoroughly investigate and address this issue." NASA's statement A model of SpaceX's Dragon capsule, which is designed to carry astronauts. Kevork Djansezian/Getty Images We also contacted NASA about any potential disruptions to its Commercial Crew Program (CCP) through which SpaceX and Boeing are designing, building, and testing spacecraft to launch astronauts to the International Space Station. The ultimate goal of CCP is to replace the astronaut-launching ability of the Space Shuttle program, lost in mid-2011 — and prevent the space agency from having to pay Russia billions of dollars for the privilege. NASA spokesperson Tabatha Thompson told Business Insider on Friday evening (our emphasis added): "NASA remains confident in our commercial partners and in the goals of the Commercial Crew Program to take astronauts to and from low-Earth orbit. It is too early to know whether Thursday's incident will impact their development schedules. Spacecraft and launch vehicles designed for the Commercial Crew Program must meet NASA's stringent safety criteria before being certified to launch crews into space. Successfully meeting those requirements has always taken precedence over schedule. "Both companies working with the Commercial Crew Program are required to carry numerous additional safeguards including a launch abort system that can be activated while the rocket is still on the launch pad. Those systems must be proven in flight tests before NASA will certify them for missions carrying astronauts. SpaceX tested its launch abort system from the pad successfully in May 2015. Both SpaceX and Boeing plan to further test launch abort systems in 2017. "NASA and our partners remain committed to meeting the goals of the Commercial Crew Program." 'This will definitely affect their business' Space Launch Complex 40 in Cape Canaveral, Florida, prior to the September 1 Falcon 9 rocket explosion. SpaceX Although SpaceX is bullish about getting back to launching Falcon 9 rockets and its $10 billion worth of payloads, John M. Logsdon, a space-policy expert and historian at George Washington University's Space Policy Institute, said there will be some kind of disruption. "This will definitely affect their business," Logsdon told Business Insider. "SpaceX had six more launches from [SLC-40] scheduled between now and January. They were going to launch one basically once a month, one every three and a half weeks." Beyond any deviations from its previous launch plans, Logsdon said Musk may have more immediate concerns. "You have to put this into the context of Mr. Musk's plans in about three weeks to announce his long-term strategy and approach to colonizing Mars," Logsdon said. "This is going to put a little tweak in the excitement surrounding that." Then again, says Logsdon, "we didn't stop going to the moon when we had early problems with Apollo."

The Soyuz TMA-20M spacecraft carrying astronaut Jeff Williams of NASA and cosmonauts Alexey Ovchinin and Oleg Skripochka of the Russian space agency Roscosmos landed near the town of Dzhezkazgan, Kazakhstan. Veteran NASA astronaut Williams has now spent 534 days in space, making him first on the all-time NASA astronaut list. "From his first flight in 2000, when the station was still under construction, to present day where the focus is science, technology development and fostering commercialisation, Williams even helped prepare the space station for future dockings of commercial spacecraft under NASA's Commercial Crew Programme," said Kirk Shireman, ISS programme manager at NASA's Johnson Space Centre in Houston. "We're incredibly proud of what Williams has accomplished off the Earth for the Earth," he added. The first International Docking Adapter was installed during a spacewalk by Williams and fellow NASA astronaut Kate Rubins on August 19. Outfitted with a host of sensors and systems, the adapter's main purpose is to connect spacecraft bringing astronauts to the station in the future. Its first users are expected to be Boeing's CST-100 Starliner and SpaceX's Crew Dragon spacecraft, now in development in partnership with NASA. Together, the Expedition 48 crew members contributed to hundreds of experiments in biology, biotechnology, physical science and Earth science aboard humanity's only orbiting laboratory. The crew members also welcomed five cargo spacecraft during their stay. Expedition 49 continues operating the station with Anatoly Ivanishin of Roscosmos in command until the arrival of three new crew members. Shane Kimbrough of NASA and cosmonauts Sergey Ryzhikov and Andrey Borisenko of Roscosmos are scheduled to launch from Baikonur, Kazakhstan, on September 23. --IANS na/ksk Advertisement << Previous Article   «Back Ad Ad Most Read Demonetisation: Get Rs 2,000 cash at petrol pumps from Nov 18 ATMs in small cities, villages will take weeks to be ready More trouble ahead as Tata Trusts get I-T summons for tax avoidance Modus Operandi: How black money hoarders are trying to escape I-T lens Ratan Tata should step down for crisis to abate: 6 suggestions from NYU's Damodaran More From Current Affairs Senior UP official injured in Expressway crash Morocco to support Fiji in organising COP23 Our railway budgets aim development, not politics: PM Bhartiya Mazdoor Sangh calls for scrapping income tax Demonetisation main issue in Bengal by-polls [ more ] Top Stories No note exchange at banks tomorrow; senior citizens exempted Shekhar Gupta: The WhatsApp governance ATMs in small cities, villages will take weeks to be ready Bajaj commences production of 400-cc bike from Chakan plant Demonetisation: Govt may do away with cash exchange gradually [ more ] Markets MCX to levy concentration margin from December Gold quotes at huge discount, price hits 4-month low Diamond exporters eye 8-10% rise in exports in coming quarter Nifty nears 6-month low, Sensex ends 77 points lower Vakrangee, Oil India, Engineers India, Infibeam Incorporation hit 52-week high [ more ] Companies Vikram Johri: Lessons from a scandal Bajaj commences production of 400-cc bike from Chakan plant Natco plans to double drug filings next year Infosys invests Rs 14.5 crore in Danish artificial intelligence start-up No Indian Pharma company in world Access to Medicine Index [ more ] Opinion Shekhar Gupta: The WhatsApp governance Why Gruh Finance isn't a top pick among analysts anymore?

A recent report by NASA's chief watchdog raised new doubts about the readiness of contractors to deliver astronauts to space, even before Thursday's explosion of a SpaceX rocket. Any further delay, NASA's Inspector General found, could mean a continued reliance on Russia to deliver American astronauts to space, a ferry ride that has been growing steadily more expensive. Since the last shuttle mission blasted off from the Kennedy Space Center in 2011, NASA's astronauts have had to hitch rides to the International Space Station with Russia, the country America bested in the Cold War race to the moon. That has come with a pricetag that grew precipitously after the shuttle was retired in 2011. A report issued this week by NASA's Inspector General found the cost Russia charged to ferry U.S. astronauts jumped 384 percent over the last decade, growing from $21.3 million in 2006 to $81.9 million last year. Before the shuttle was retired, Russia kept its costs relatively consistent, with the prices growing modestly, the report found. But after the United Space couldn't get to space on its own, the prices jumped from an average of $26.4 million a seat in 2010 to $51 million in 2012. In all, the U.S. has paid Russia $3.4 billion for rides on its Soyuz rocket, and the IG said NASA could have saved $1 billion of that if it had met its original goal of flying human missions in 2015. The agency's watchdog said that Russia will rake in even more taxpayer money if there are additional delays to NASA's efforts to fly again from U.S. soil. In 2014, NASA awarded contracts to Boeing and SpaceX to fly its astronauts to the station. But the so-called “commercial crew” program is facing delays, the IG found, so that “NASA may need to buy additional seats from Russia to ensure a continued U.S. presence” on the space station. The report was written before SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket blew up as it sat on the launchpad at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Thursday. It's unclear whether that failure will contribute to any delays in the commercial crew program. But it was the second time one of SpaceX's rockets has blown up in the last 15 months, raising concerns about its ability to fly people safely and whether it will be able to meet its timeline. NASA has stood by SpaceX through both failures, saying it recovered quickly after the first. And on Thursday agency officials said they “remain confident in our commercial partners.” In its report, the IG noted that SpaceX did not think its first failure, which happened in June 2015 on a mission to resupply with space station with $118 million worth of cargo, would cause a delay in the commercial crew program. The company said “it had built sufficient margin into the schedule,” according to the report. But it also said SpaceX “noted the lack of margin remaining to accommodate any additional unexpected issues that may arise.” The report was released on the same day SpaceX's rocket exploded. Boeing has already said it would have to push back its first crewed flights to early 2018. SpaceX has maintained that it would fly by the end of 2017. But the IG investigators weren't buying either of those timetables: “Notwithstanding the contractors' optimism, based on the information we gathered during our audit, we believe it unlikely that either Boeing or SpaceX will achieve certified, crewed flight to the ISS until late 2018.” More Nation Winter weather to move in across U.S. Trump taps Sessions, Flynn, Pompeo for top positions Cozy retirement?

April this year was hottest on record: NASA Venus may have once been habitable: NASA NASA makes 56 patents free for commercial use An American astronaut who set the US record for cumulative time in orbit safely returned to Earth today along with two Russian cosmonauts after a six-month mission aboard the International Space Station. NASA's Jeff Williams, 58, logged 534 days in space over four missions. The ISS commander landed at 7:13 local time on the steppes of central Kazakhstan aboard a Russian-made Soyuz capsule along with Alexey Ovchinin and Oleg Skripochka. "Touchdown! Welcome home @Astro_Jeff, officially back on Earth after 172-day mission & total 534 days on 4 missions," NASA tweeted. A NASA live video feed showed Williams on the ground smiling and waving while talking on a satellite phone before being carried away for medical tests. The three men undocked from the ISS nearly three and a half hours earlier after spending their mission largely conducting scientific experiments. Williams performed five space walks, including one along with NASA astronaut Kate Rubins to install a docking adapter for future commercial Boeing and SpaceX crew capsules to visit the space station. "Williams was instrumental in preparing the station for the future arrival of US commercial crew spacecraft," NASA said in a statement. He also helped set up an experimental temporary inflatable module designed by Bigelow Aerospace to test expandable habitats astronauts might use on the Moon or Mars in the coming decades. The retired Army colonel beat the previous US record set by astronaut Scott Kelly during his year in orbit. Kelly has 520 days in space over his career. Williams, a grandfather, is also the oldest American to spend live on the space station. Williams first blasted to space aboard the shuttle Atlantis in 2000. He returned to the International Space Station in 2006 when the space station was far smaller -- with just two modules and three crew members -- and again in 2009. Today, the ISS is staffed by six astronauts and cosmonauts and spans the size of a football field. Williams may hold the US record for time in orbit, but Russia's Gennady Padalka still holds the record for the person with the most cumulative days in space at 879.

"Williams was instrumental in preparing the station for the future arrival of US commercial crew spacecraft," NASA said in a statement. He also helped set up an experimental temporary inflatable module designed by Bigelow Aerospace to test expandable habitats astronauts might use on the Moon or Mars in the coming decades. The retired Army colonel beat the previous US record set by astronaut Scott Kelly during his year in orbit. Kelly has 520 days in space over his career. Williams, a grandfather, is also the oldest American to spend live on the space station. Williams first blasted to space aboard the shuttle Atlantis in 2000. He returned to the International Space Station in 2006 when the space station was far smaller -- with just two modules and three crew members -- and again in 2009. Today, the ISS is staffed by six astronauts and cosmonauts and spans the size of a football field. Williams may hold the US record for time in orbit, but Russia's Gennady Padalka still holds the record for the person with the most cumulative days in space at 879.

AFP Business Standard http://bsmedia.business-standard.com/_media/bs/wap/images/bs_logo_amp.png 177 22 Record-holding US astronaut and two Russians return to Earth An American astronaut who set the US record for cumulative time in orbit safely returned to Earth today along with two Russian cosmonauts after a six-month mission aboard the International Space Station. NASA's Jeff Williams, 58, logged 534 days in space over four missions. The ISS commander landed at 7:13 local time on the steppes of central Kazakhstan aboard a Russian-made Soyuz capsule along with Alexey Ovchinin and Oleg Skripochka. "Touchdown! Welcome home @Astro_Jeff, officially back on Earth after 172-day mission & total 534 days on 4 missions," NASA tweeted. A NASA live video feed showed Williams on the ground smiling and waving while talking on a satellite phone before being carried away for medical tests.

The Soyuz TMA-20M spacecraft carrying astronaut Jeff Williams of NASA and cosmonauts Alexey Ovchinin and Oleg Skripochka of the Russian space agency Roscosmos landed near the town of Dzhezkazgan, Kazakhstan. Veteran NASA astronaut Williams has now spent 534 days in space, making him first on the all-time NASA astronaut list. "From his first flight in 2000, when the station was still under construction, to present day where the focus is science, technology development and fostering commercialisation, Williams even helped prepare the space station for future dockings of commercial spacecraft under NASA's Commercial Crew Programme," said Kirk Shireman, ISS programme manager at NASA's Johnson Space Centre in Houston. "We're incredibly proud of what Williams has accomplished off the Earth for the Earth," he added. The first International Docking Adapter was installed during a spacewalk by Williams and fellow NASA astronaut Kate Rubins on August 19. Outfitted with a host of sensors and systems, the adapter's main purpose is to connect spacecraft bringing astronauts to the station in the future. Its first users are expected to be Boeing's CST-100 Starliner and SpaceX's Crew Dragon spacecraft, now in development in partnership with NASA. Together, the Expedition 48 crew members contributed to hundreds of experiments in biology, biotechnology, physical science and Earth science aboard humanity's only orbiting laboratory. The crew members also welcomed five cargo spacecraft during their stay. Expedition 49 continues operating the station with Anatoly Ivanishin of Roscosmos in command until the arrival of three new crew members. Shane Kimbrough of NASA and cosmonauts Sergey Ryzhikov and Andrey Borisenko of Roscosmos are scheduled to launch from Baikonur, Kazakhstan, on September 23.

Williams and his Russian crewmates Alexey Ovchinin and Oleg Skripochka, of the Russian space agency Roscosmos, landed in their Soyuz TMA-20M at 9:13 p.m. EDT southeast of the remote town of Dzhezkazgan in Kazakhstan (7:13 a.m. Sept. 7, local time). Having completed his fourth mission, Williams now has spent 534 days in space, making him first on the all-time NASA astronaut list. Skripochka now has 331 days in space on two flights, while Ovchinin spent 172 days in space on his first. "No other U.S. astronaut has Jeff's time and experience aboard the International Space Station. From his first flight in 2000, when the station was still under construction, to present day where the focus is science, technology development and fostering commercialization. Jeff even helped prepare the space station for future dockings of commercial spacecraft under NASA's Commercial Crew Program," said Kirk Shireman, ISS Program manager at NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston. "We're incredibly proud of what Jeff has accomplished off the Earth for the Earth." Williams was instrumental in preparing the station for the future arrival of U.S. commercial crew spacecraft. The first International Docking Adapter was installed during a spacewalk by Williams and fellow NASA astronaut Kate Rubins Aug. 19. Outfitted with a host of sensors and systems, the adapter's main purpose is to connect spacecraft bringing astronauts to the station in the future. Its first users are expected to be Boeing's CST-100 Starliner and SpaceX's Crew Dragon spacecraft, now in development in partnership with NASA. During his time on the orbital complex, Williams ventured outside the confines of the space station for a second spacewalk with Rubins to retract a spare thermal control radiator and install two new high-definition cameras.  Together, the Expedition 48 crew members contributed to hundreds of experiments in biology, biotechnology, physical science and Earth science aboard humanity's only orbiting laboratory. The crew members also welcomed five cargo spacecraft during their stay. Williams was involved in the grapple of Orbital ATK's Cygnus spacecraft in March, the company's fourth commercial resupply mission, and SpaceX's eighth Dragon spacecraft cargo delivery in April, and welcomed a second Dragon delivery in July. Two Russian ISS Progress cargo craft also docked to the station in April and July delivering tons of supplies. Expedition 49 continues operating the station with Anatoly Ivanishin of Roscosmos in command. He, Rubins, and Takuya Onishi of the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, will operate the station for more than two weeks until the arrival of three new crew members.

The Soyuz TMA-20M spacecraft touched down, bringing the crew back to Earth after six months in space. (Credit: Reuters)  Three space explorers, including NASA's most experienced astronaut, have landed safely back on Earth after spending six months in space. NASA's Jeff Williams and cosmonauts Alexey Ovchinin and Oleg Skripochka of Russian space agency Roscosmos landed the Soyuz TMA-20M spacecraft in Kazakhstan at 9:13pm (local time). Russian recovery teams helped the crew exit as they adjusted to gravity back on land after spending the past six months in space. External Link: NASA tweets: Welcome home @Astro_Jeff NASA broadcast the landing live from the moment the trio disconnected from the International Space Station (ISS) to their descent to Earth. The mission was Mr Williams' fourth trip to the ISS, allowing him to accrue 534 days in space — the most by any US astronaut in history. Mr Williams was instrumental in preparing the station for the future arrival of US commercial crew spacecraft, NASA said. The space juggernaut also sung Mr Williams' praises for his role in installing the first ISS docking adapter in August, during a six-hour spacewalk. Described as a "parking spot for spacecraft" the installation will allow more astronauts to travel to the ISS. The first users are expected to be Boeing's CST-100 Starliner and SpaceX's Crew Dragon spacecraft.

WASHINGTON: The US is likely to make a positive decision on India's request for state-of-the art unarmed Guardian drones for maritime surveillance, especially in the Indian Ocean. The move comes after India was designated a major defence partner of the US in June. Within weeks of that designation, after Prime Minister Narendra Modi met US President Barack Obama, at the White House in early June, the Indian Navy had sent an official letter of request (LoR) in February to Department of Defense towards purchase of 22 high-tech multi-mission Predator Guardian UAVs. This was the first major request of arms sale purchase by India after Obama designated New Delhi as a major Strategic Defence partner. The US government has not made a formal decision on it yet, but is believed to have started an inter agency process on the Indian request. According to sources, the administration believes that an approval of such a major military sale would help in "sealing Indian US defense relationship", bring in "a new level of comfort" between the two militaries and would be considered as a lasting legacy not only for India but also for the Asia-Pacific pivot of the outgoing president. Officials here believe the sale of predator Guardian UAVs would act as a force multiplier for India's maritime surveillance capabilities in the Indian Ocean region; which of late has become one of the key American objective in the Asia Pacific region. Top governmental sources confirmed that Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar and US Defence Secretary Ashton Carter had detailed discussions on predator Guardian UAV to fulfill maritime surveillance requirements. Parrikar was in the US last week and held meetings with Carter at the Pentagon on August 29. During the meeting, Carter is understood have assured Parrikar he would personally "champion" India's request "within the system," sources said. At General Atomics which has announced to office in India this year, the effort is being spearheaded by Dr Vivek Lall who had been also instrumental in India's ability to procure advanced Boeing P8I aircraft for maritime domain awareness capability, they said. Sources indicate along with the White House, the Pentagon and some influential members of the US are keen to complete the process as soon as possible before Obama leaves his presidency next January. However, a section within the State Department have to be convinced that this is in the interest of the US national security as well. This maritime capability will be a force multiplier for the Indian Navy who has procured other advance technologies including Boeing P-8 aircraft. The Guardian, manufactured by General Atomics, has cutting edge technologies that do not do not exist in the current Indian Navy arsenal. Sources also said beyond the symbolism of this new title, this deal, estimated to be worth USD 2 billion, will give meat to the bone to this designation and could be considered as a milestone in India US defense relationship. In addition, it would create several hundred jobs in the US. However, insiders said that a strong Pakistani lobby is working overtime putting strong resistance to the Indian quest trying to "confuse" the decision and opinion makers with armed drones that could be used against it. But those pushing for this major arms sales deal which would ultimately go through foreign military sale (FMS) route stress that this is simply unarmed drones to enhance India's maritime surveillance capabilities in the Indian Ocean. It has nothing to do with Pakistan. Stay on top of business news with The Economic Times App. Download it Now! FROM AROUND THE WEB Come be part of the Royal Celebrations!

The airline intends to redeem $700 million of U.S. dollar first- and second-lien bonds maturing in 2019 and 2020, as well as C$300 million ($233 million) of Canadian dollar bonds maturing in 2019, Air Canada said in a statement Tuesday. The arrangement includes plans to refinance its existing senior secured credit facility as well as the notes, the Montreal-based company said. Air Canada is in the midst of a plan to trim its key cost ratio by about 21 percent by 2018. To get there, the carrier is cramming more passengers on long-haul aircraft, expanding the low-cost Rouge leisure unit and adding fuel-efficient jets such as Boeing Co.’s 787 Dreamliner. Airfares are under pressure as U.S. airlines add capacity, with Air Canada’s yields on trans-Atlantic routes falling 9.6 percent in the second quarter, according to Bloomberg Intelligence data. Air Canada plans to redeem the U.S. dollar first-lien notes at an average weighted price of 103.34 cents on the dollar and the Canadian dollar notes at 103.73, the company said. The second-lien notes will be redeemed at 100 percent of the principal amount plus interest. The company had C$6.4 billion in long-term debt and finance leases as of June 30, according to second-quarter results. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Vardhan said the government has earmarked ₹500 crore to scale up the start-up eco system, under which seed funding of up to ₹10 lakh will be given to develop a prototype and access fabrication facilities in incubators. He said thereafter the department will also help connect the innovators with angel investors and venture capitalists. The department has already held camps to promote NIDHI in 4,000 colleges, he added. The Minister said the department has partnered with large international corporates, such as Intel, Lockheed Martin, Boeing and Texas Instruments, to initiate technology-driven, innovation-based programmes to promote start-ups. “The existing total incubation space in the country of about 7 lakh square feet will soon be expanded to 20 lakh square feet,” he added. Ashutosh Sharma, Secretary, Science and Technology Ministry said: “As opposed to 100 incubators set up in the past 30 years, the government plans to develop 200 in the next five years.” (This article was published on September 6, 2016) Related TOPICS science and technology | Get more of your favourite news delivered to your inbox SEND MY NEWS Please enter your email.

Datum Tool Design Hamilton has also secured a new customer in China and recently signed an initial order for more than $1 million with X’ian Aircraft Corporation after a visit to the province in 2014. Welcoming the news Economy Minister Simon Hamilton described the business as a “well-established and unique design and manufacturing business with a true global competitive advantage”. “This exciting development will enable Datum to offer manufacturing support as well as design solutions to its customer base and take advantage of emerging opportunities, particularly in China. “The investment will create 13 skilled engineering roles in Co Down over the next three years which will generate £358,500 in annual salaries into the local economy.” By implementing this expansion Mr Hamilton said the firm would strengthen not just its own global competitive position but that of the wider Northern Ireland Aerospace sector. “With our manufacturing exports growing, I want to see more companies like this capitalise on their exporting potential. Invest NI’s support for this project is ensuring that aerospace companies like Datum evolve and establish the skills sets, design and manufacturing capabilities to meet the needs of this global industry,” he said. Datum is a specialist designer of composite tooling primarily for the global aerospace and automotive sectors. Its customer base includes Airbus, Boeing, Bombardier, Gulfstream, AVIC China, HAL India, Quickstep Australia, Aston Martin and some Formula One teams. This news aligns with the company’s £785,000 investment supported from Invest NI to enhance its manufacturing capabilities so that it can compete for higher value projects. “Working with Invest NI has ignited our export ambitions and its support with this expansion is enabling us to undertake the R&D and market development activities which will strengthen our competitive position,” said director Michael Maguire. “A number of new aircraft programmes are being introduced to meet increasing demand for air travel and enhancing our manufacturing capabilities and workforce will enhance the scope to target emerging markets.” X’ian Aircraft Corporation is developing the new MA-700 aircraft and Datum Tool Design is the first overseas sub-contractor to be awarded work.

Credit: NASA Less than a week after winding up a successful spacewalk, outgoing space station commander Jeff Williams, America’s most experienced astronaut, will join two Russian cosmonauts for a fiery descent to Earth Tuesday evening to close out a 172-day mission covering 2,752 orbits and 72.8 million miles since launch last March. “I will certainly miss this view!” Williams tweeted from the station early Tuesday, sending down a photo of Earth’s limb in brilliant sunlight. “Vast gratitude toward my crewmates, ground teams, supporting friends, and family.” In a change-of-command ceremony Monday, Williams, 58, said leaving the station marked a “bitter-sweet” time for the departing crew members, saying all three were “ready to go home and be with our families.” “We’ve enjoyed a great stay up here over the last five-and-a-half months,” he said. “This is a very significant time, in my opinion, in the life of the space station, going into the full utilization mode, being the orbiting laboratory we’ve always said it was going to be.” He thanked his family, friends and space station personnel on the ground, saying “we could not have done this without their sacrifice and their support and encouragement. We look forward to seeing our families very, very soon.” Williams, Soyuz TMA-20M commander Alexey Ovchinin and flight engineer Oleg Skripochka plan to undock from the International Space Station’s upper Poisk module at 5:51 p.m. EDT (GMT-4) Tuesday, backing away to a safe distance while they make final preparations for re-entry. Looking on from inside the station will be Expedition 49 commander Anatoly Ivanishin, Japanese astronaut Takuya Onishi and NASA astronaut Kate Rubins. Launched to the station July 6 aboard the Soyuz MS-01 spacecraft, Ivanishin and his crewmates will have the space lab to themselves until Sept. 25 when three fresh crew members arrive. “We’ll be missing you here,” Ivanishin said Monday. “Have fun riding though the atmosphere, enjoy seeing plasma in the windows and have a very safe, and exceptionally soft, landing. All the best.” After making sure the Soyuz TMA-20M spacecraft is ready for its descent, Ovchinin, flanked on the left by Skripochka and on the right by Williams, will oversee a computer controlled de-orbit rocket firing starting at 8:21 p.m. The four-minute 41-second burn will slow the ship by 286 mph, just enough to drop the far side of the orbit deep into Earth’s atmosphere. After a 25-minute free fall to just above the top of the discernible atmosphere, the three modules making up the Soyuz TMA-20M spacecraft will separate. A few moments after that, the central crew cabin, the only module protected by a heat shield, will slam into the atmosphere at an altitude of 62 miles and a velocity of some 17,000 mph. Using atmospheric friction to slow down, the descent module’s main parachute will deploy at an altitude of 6.7 miles and the spacecraft will land with a rocket-assisted touchdown on the steppe of Kazakhstan near the town of Dzhezkazgan around 9:14 p.m. (7:14 a.m. Wednesday local time). Recovery crews stationed nearby will help the returning crew members out of the cramped descent module, carry out brief medical exams and fly all three back to Karaganda where Williams will board a NASA jet for the long flight back home to Houston. Jeff Williams, Alexei Ovchinin and Oleg Skripochka line up for final qualification exams in February before their launch to the International Space Station. Credit: NASA/Bill Ingalls Asked what he was looking forward to the most, Williams said “obviously, family is the first thing, my wife, she’s the real hero in all this putting up with me being up here that many days.” “I look forward to quiet, just relaxing someplace, enjoying the views, enjoying the smells of Earth, all those things that we normally take for granted,” he told CBS News last month. “You miss that when you’re up here. We have continuous noise up here from fans and pumps, it’s not loud, but it’s continuous.” All in all, he said, “just the simple things in life. Good food, anything my wife wants to cook, I look forward to that, those kinds of things, friends.” Williams and his two crewmates were launched from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on March 18 and landing closes out a busy increment highlighted by two spacewalks, the arrival of two Russian Progress cargo ships, a pair of SpaceX Dragon freighters, an Orbital ATK Cygnus supply craft and the Soyuz MS-01 crew. During a spacewalk Aug. 19, Williams and Rubins attached a new docking mechanism to the front of the station that will allow new commercial crew ferry ships being built by Boeing and SpaceX to dock at the lab complex, ending NASA’s sole reliance on Russia’s Soyuz for transportation. During a second spacewalk last Thursday, Rubins and Williams, making his fifth EVA overall, retracted a cooling radiator, installed two high-definition cameras and performed other routine maintenance. The two astronauts logged 12 hours and 46 minutes during the two excursions, pushing Williams’ overall total through five EVAs to 31 hours and 55 minutes. Those spacewalks cover much of the history of the International Space Station with his first excursion coming during a shuttle maintenance mission in May 2000. He then ventured outside a second time with a Russian cosmonaut in June 2006 to perform maintenance on the Russian segment of the station. Two months after that, he went back outside with a European Space Agency astronaut to work on the station’s cooling system. Williams served as commander of Expedition 22 during his second long-duration stay aboard the lab and again as commander of Expedition 48 during this most recent mission. With touchdown, Ovchinin, completing his first space flight, will have logged 172 days in space while flight engineer Skripochka’s record over two flights will stand at 331 days. For Williams, the end of the mission marked a personal milestone. On Aug. 20, he surpassed the U.S. record for most cumulative time in space — 520 days — that was set earlier this year by astronaut Scott Kelly at the end of his nearly yearlong mission. With landing Tuesday, Williams’ mark will stand at 534 days aloft over four missions, moving him up to 14th on the list of most experienced spacemen. The overall record is held by Gennady Padalka, who has logged 878 days in space over five missions. “I appreciate, Jeff, your efforts as space station commander,” Ivanishin said during the change-of-command ceremony. “I’ll take care of the crew and the station. And I promise you, when you return to celebrate your first 1,000 days in space, the station will be in better shape!” Williams, Ovchinin and Skripochka will be replaced aboard the station by the Soyuz MS-02 crew, scheduled for launch from Baikonur on Sept. 23. After a two-day rendezvous, vehicle commander Andrey Borisenko, flight engineer Sergey Ryzhikov and NASA astronaut Shane Kimbrough will dock at the Poisk module to boost the lab’s crew back to six. Ivanishin, Onishi and Rubins are scheduled to return to Earth Oct. 30.

Descending under a billowing orange-and-white parachute, the charred Soyuz crew module completed a jarring rocket-assisted touchdown at 9:13 p.m. EDT (GMT-4; 7:13 a.m. Wednesday local time). The Soyuz TMA-20M spacecraft is seen as it lands with Expedition 48 crew members NASA astronaut Jeff Williams, Russian cosmonauts Alexey Ovchinin, and Oleg Skripochka of Roscosmos near the town of Zhezkazgan, Kazakhstan on Wednesday, Sept. 7, 2016(Kazakh time). NASA/Bill Ingalls, (NASA/Bill Ingalls) As sometimes happens, the capsule tipped over on its side after landing, but Russian recovery crews stationed nearby were on the scene in minutes to tilt the spacecraft upright and to help the station fliers, getting their first taste of gravity in five-and-a-half months, out of the cramped compartment. Williams, Soyuz commander Alexey Ovchinin and flight engineer Oleg Skripochka appeared healthy and in good spirits as they were carried out of the descent module and set down in recliners for satellite phone calls home while flight surgeons carried out quick medical checks. Outgoing space station commander Jeff Williams, left, Soyuz TMA-20M commander Alexey Ovchinin, center, and flight engineer Oleg Skripochka relax in recliners on the steppe of Kazakhstan after an on-target landing. Recovery crews planned to fly all three crew members by helicopter to Karaganda later in the day for an official welcome home ceremony. From there, Williams was to board a NASA jet for the long flight back home to Houston. Ovchinin and Skripochka planned to head for Star City near Moscow for debriefing and reunions with family members. “I will certainly miss this view!” Williams tweeted from the station early Tuesday, sending down a photo of Earth’s limb in brilliant sunlight. “Vast gratitude toward my crewmates, ground teams, supporting friends, and family.” “We’ve enjoyed a great stay up here over the last five-and-a-half months,” he said earlier. “This is a very significant time, in my opinion, in the life of the space station, going into the full utilization mode, being the orbiting laboratory we’ve always said it was going to be.”   Russian recovery crews presented Ovchinin with a watermelon shortly after landing. NASA/Roscosmos Williams, Ovchinin and Skripochka undocked from the lab’s upper Poisk module at 5:51 p.m., slowly backing away as the two spacecraft passed more than 250 miles above the western Pacific Ocean. Looking on from inside the station were Expedition 49 commander Anatoly Ivanishin, Japanese astronaut Takuya Onishi and NASA astronaut Kate Rubins. Launched to the station July 6 aboard the Soyuz MS-01 spacecraft, Ivanishin and his crewmates will have the space lab to themselves until Sept. 25 when three fresh crew members arrive. “We’ll be missing you here,” Ivanishin said Monday during a change-of-command ceremony. “Have fun riding though the atmosphere, enjoy seeing plasma in the windows and have a very safe, and exceptionally soft, landing. All the best.” After making sure the Soyuz TMA-20M spacecraft was ready for its descent, Ovchinin, flanked on the left by Skripochka and on the right by Williams, monitored a computer controlled de-orbit rocket firing starting at 8:21 p.m. The four-minute 41-second burn slowed the ship by 286 mph, just enough to drop the far side of the orbit deep into Earth’s atmosphere. After a 25-minute free fall to just above the top of the discernible atmosphere, the three modules making up the Soyuz TMA-20M spacecraft separated. A few moments after that, the central crew cabin, the only module protected by a heat shield, slammed into the atmosphere at an altitude of 62 miles and a velocity of some 17,000 mph. Using atmospheric friction to slow down, the descent module’s main parachute deployed at an altitude of a little less than seven miles and the spacecraft settled to the steppe of Kazakhstan. Jeff Williams, front left, Oleg Skripochka, front center, and Soyuz TMA-20M commander Alexey Ovchinin, front right, hand over the station to their Soyuz MS-01 crewmates during a change-of-command ceremony Monday.

The Ministry of Science and Technology has also increased by a whooping 450 per cent the budget for the start ups and innovation centric initiatives from Rs 40 crore to Rs 180 crores. Currently, there are nearly 100 incubation centres across the country in various IITs, IIMs, NITs and other institutes. These incubators focused on a technology domain and collectively housed more than 2000 start ups. "We plant to double it in the next 4-5 years. This year alone we are adding 20 more incubators," said Ashutosh Sharma, Secretary Department of Science and Technology (DST) under the Ministry of S&T. Union Minister of S&T Harsh Vardhan said start ups would now be given a fund of Rs 1 crore as against the earlier Rs 10 lakh. "Plus, the government will now also act as a facilitator to these start ups apart from giving them any funding. To give start ups a boost, the government has increased funding to these incubators from Rs 40 crore to Rs 180 crore," he said. Apart from setting the ground ready for the prospective start ups, the DST has also partnered with corporates like Intel, Lockheed Martin and Boeing to initiate variety of technology-driven and innovation-based programmes. Further the DST has also partnered with Department of Higher Education of the HRD Ministry to establish research parks and Start Up centres in various academic institutions of national importance. The government has already launched National Initiative for Developing and Harnessing Innovations (NIDHI), an umbrella programme conceived and developed by the Innovation & Entrepreneurship division of DTS, for nurturing ideas and innovations (knowledge-based and technology-driven) into successful startups. The programme would work in line with the national priorities and goals and its focus would be to build an innovation driven entrepreneurial ecosystem with an objective of socioeconomic development through wealth and job creation.

PKL Services gets $495 million Saudi F-15 support contract by Geoff Ziezulewicz Washington (UPI) Sep 2, 2016 disclaimer: image is for illustration purposes only PKL Services has been awarded a $495 million U.S. Air Force contract for work on the Royal Saudi Air Force's F-15 fleet. The indefinite-delivery/indefinite-quantity contract covers maintenance, upgrade and training of the Saudi Strike Eagle S- and SA-type fighters. Work will be performed and has an estimated completion date of August 2021. The contract is 100 percent foreign military sales to Saudi Arabia. The 338th Specialized Contracting Squadron is the contracting activity. The Royal Saudi Air Force has flown the F-15S fighters since the 1990s, Boeing said. The F-15SA was rolled out in 2013 and featured improved performance and increased survivability at a lower life-cycle cost. It also features two additional wing stations for increased payload and capability.

CGCN Group – one of the most prominent GOP lobbying shops in D.C. – is launching the arm to help generate and shape stories for its more than 50 lobbying clients. Story Continued Below “We’ve wanted to add a communications practice for years but needed the right person to head it up. No one knows the media quite like a former reporter,” said Sam Geduldig, a partner in the firm who was a House Republican leadership staffer. “Patrick was always at the top of our list because he’s so respected by his peers and the politicians he covered.” CGCN, which also recently added former top House Republican leadership staffer John Stipicevic to its team, is following in line with a growing trend in D.C. With Congress increasingly stagnant, lobbying firms are not only waging war on Capitol Hill, but also in the press. CGCN has grown exponentially since Republicans took over Congress in 2010. It boasts clients like 21st Century Fox, Microsoft, MasterCard and Boeing. O’Connor has been at the Wall Street Journal since 2010, covering Congress and national politics. He was one of the first reporters hired by POLITICO, and was one of the lead reporters covering Democrats’ battle to pass an overhaul of the nation’s health care laws early in Barack Obama’s first term. He worked at Bloomberg News before joining the Journal. “Patrick is the complete pro,” said Wall Street Journal bureau chief Jerry Seib. “Smart, analytical, well-liked, well-sourced. He has the total package for a political reporter, and we'll really miss him. But I also understand that those very same attributes make him attractive in his new life as well.” Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Authors: Jake Sherman sherman@politico.com @JakeSherman Show Comments Politico Magazine ‘My Language Is My Language, But I’m a Vermonter’ By Erick Trickey The Bitter Feud Behind the Law That Could Keep Jared Kushner Out of the White House By Josh Zeitz America’s First All-Renewable-Energy City By Colin Woodard The Return of ‘Inner Circle’ Frenzy By Jack Shafer More on POLITICO Core Footer - dropdown links U.S. Edition Europe Edition POLITICO Links News POLITICO Home Magazine 2016 Elections Congress Video POLITICO Pro POLITICO Media POLITICO Florida POLITICO New Jersey POLITICO New York Events Blogs, Columns & Cartoons Roger Simon On Media Josh Gerstein Matt Wuerker Rich Lowry Cartoon Carousel Tipsheets The 2016 Blast Playbook Huddle The Friday Cover Influence Morning Agriculture Morning Cybersecurity Morning Defense Morning Education Morning eHealth Morning Energy Morning Money Morning Score Morning Shift Morning Tax Morning Tech Morning Trade Morning Transportation Pulse Prescription Pulse Policy Agriculture Campaigns Cybersecurity Defense Education eHealth Energy & Environment Finance & Tax Health Care Labor & Employment Technology Trade Transportation & Infrastructure More Info About Us Advertising Breaking News Alerts Credit Card Payments Digital Edition Employment FAQ Feedback Headlines Photos POWERJobs Press Register Subscriptions RSS/Widgets Site Map Store © 2016 POLITICO LLC Terms of Service Privacy Policy

Airbus said the planes shipped, including six A350 long-range jets, were an August record. They bring Airbus total deliveries to 400 planes in the first eight months against a target of handing over at least 650 aircraft in 2016. Airbus struggled early this year with plane deliveries amid supplier bottlenecks that caused some models to fall behind schedule, angering airline customers. It also weighed on the company's cash flow. Airbus said it had delivered 21 A350 planes this year through the end of August. It needs to ship at least 24 more in the last four months of the year to stick to plan. Another model that has struggled is the A320neo, an upgraded version of the European plane maker's popular single-aisle plane. Qatar Airways has cancelled some of the A320neo planes it had ordered because of delays with that model. Airbus said in its monthly update that order cancellations this year have now reached 79 planes, up from 50 cancellations in the prior month. Most are for single-aisle models, where its backlog of planes yet to be built is massive after years of strong order bookings. The plane maker also said it had booked 144 new jetliner orders in August. All the deals were for narrowbodies. Airbus and rival Boeing Co. are struggling to secure deals for long-range jets. Earlier Tuesday Airbus announced Vietnam Airlines had agreed to buy 10 more A350 planes on top of 10 it has already agreed to operate. The deal still needs to be finalized and would have a value of $3 billion at list price, though airlines typically get discounts.

In English На русском Հայերեն Full version September 6, 2016 - 11:30 AMT SHARE Vietnam airlines buy 40 planes worth $6.5 bn from Airbus Vietnam airlines bought 40 airplanes worth $6.5 billion from France's Airbus on Tuesday, September 6, as President Francois Hollande visited the communist nation to drum up business ties with one of Southeast Asia's fastest-growing economies, AFP says. The deal is the latest move by Vietnamese aviation giants to boost fleets and feed demand from a mushrooming middle class with money to burn on air travel both at home and abroad. Hollande, the third French president to visit Vietnam since independence, said the "very important deals" deepened ties with its former colony where France's legacy is ubiquitous, from the country's colonial-era buildings to French-influenced cuisine. "We agreed to encourage both countries to establish economic partnerships on the basis of technology transfer," Hollande said after Airbus signed three separate deals. Low-cost private airline VietJet, known for its bikini-clad hostesses, bought 20 planes while national carrier Vietnam Airlines and budget airline Jetstar Pacific bought 10 each in "deals worth 6.5 billion", Airbus Asia spokesman Sean Lee told AFP. He did not provide a breakdown of each deal's value, but VietJet said later in a statement it was spending $2.39 billion on its new planes. The VietJet purchase comes after it bought 100 passenger jets from U.S. aircraft maker Boeing for $11.3 billion in May, during a visit by President Barack Obama. It called the deal the largest single commercial air plane purchase in Vietnam aviation history. Founded in 2007, VietJet has gained notoriety with bikini-wearing air stewardesses and along with Vietnam Airlines and Jetstar is making a major move into the lucrative Southeast Asian aviation sector.

DEBT TENDER Romania sold a planned 1 billion lei ($251.22 million) worth of one-year treasury bills on Monday, with the average accepted yield at 0.56 percent, central bank data showed.

EBRD The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development said on Monday it will lend 25 million euros to Universal Alloy Corporation Europe (UACE), which manufactures aluminium parts for aircrafts and is a subsidiary of the Swiss-Austrian Montana Tech Components group.

BRAAS MONIER Braas Monier said on Monday it will acquire a concrete tile plant in the southern Romanian city of Craiova. The total investment for the acquisition of the assets amounts to roughly 33 million lei ($8.28 million). FISCAL RISKS Romania's Finance Minister Anca Dragu told parliament in a letter that the European Commission could challenge Romania at the European Court of Justice for failing to keep its budget deficit below 1 percent of GDP as agreed in a fiscal treaty. The Commission is expected to release a report about how EU countries that had signed the treaty were sticking to its terms at the end of September, Dragu said.

Low-cost private airline VietJet, known for its bikini-clad hostesses, bought 20 planes while national carrier Vietnam Airlines and budget airline Jetstar Pacific bought 10 each in "deals worth 6.5 billion", Airbus Asia spokesman Sean Lee told AFP. It did not provide a breakdown of each deal's value. It is the first deal between French aviation giant Airbus and Jetstar Pacific, which said in July it was planning to buy the 10 single-aisle A320 aircraft. Vietnam Airlines, which owns a 70 percent stake of Jetstar Pacific, will purchase 10 Airbus A350 planes, according to officials at a signing ceremony attended by Hollande and Vietnamese President Tran Dai Quang in Hanoi.

Photo by Reuters/Luong Thai Linh/Pool Vietnam's VietJet said it would buy 20 A321 planes to boost its current fleet of 34 planes, all of which are Airbus. The VietJet deal comes after it purchased 100 passenger jets from U.S. aircraft maker Boeing for $11.3 billion in May, during a visit by U.S. President Barack Obama. It called the deal the largest single commercial air plane purchase in Vietnam aviation history. VietJet, founded in 2007, has gained notoriety with bikini-wearing air stewardesses and is making a major move into the lucrative Southeast Asian aviation sector. Southeast Asia is seen as key growth market for budget air travel, driven by the region's growing middle class, many of whom are traveling for the first time.

Station commander Jeff Williams, with NASA, and flight engineers Alexey Ovchinin and Oleg Skripochka, both with Russia's Roscosmos agency, pulled away from the station at 5:51 p.m. ET Tuesday as the ships sailed 258 miles over eastern Mongolia, said NASA mission commentator Rob Navias. "I will certainly miss this view!" Williams wrote on Twitter earlier on Tuesday, posting a picture of sunlight glinting off the planet. "Vast gratitude toward my crewmates, ground teams, supporting friends, and family."

Vast gratitude toward my crewmates, ground teams, supporting friends, and family. pic.twitter.com/op9vFyWSFT — Jeff Williams (@Astro_Jeff) September 6, 2016 Right on the 'bullseye' The Soyuz capsule carrying NASA astronaut Jeff Williams and Russia's Roscosmos cosmonauts Alexey Ovchinin and Oleg Skripochka lands just after sunrise in Kazakhstan. Bill Ingalls/NASA There's always a chance something can go (terribly) wrong during a spacecraft landing, but Tuesday night's was right on the "bullseye," NASA's Dan Huot said in a phone call on the livestream from Kazakhstan. The gumdrop-shaped capsule undocked from the ISS at 8:02 p.m. ET, starting an approximately three-hour descent. A couple hours after undocking, the capsule fired its thrusters to fall out of orbit. When it reached 400,000 feet above the Earth, the planet's atmosphere drastically slowed down the Soyuz — from about 17,250 mph to less than 600 mph. Around 9 p.m. ET, the parachutes deployed and further reduced the Soyuz's speed from about 515 mph to roughly 7 mph.

Space Station (@Space_Station) September 7, 2016 A quick engine burst then safely landed the capsule near the Kazakh city of Zhezkazgan at 7:13 a.m. local time on Wednesday, which was 9:13 p.m. Tuesday on the East Coast. The Soyuz landed on its side, but that actually made hauling the astronauts out of the spaceship a little easier. Astronauts are typically a little weak and woozy after returning from the microgravity of the ISS and after pulling so many G-forces upon their return, so they usually need help getting out of the car-sized capsule. Doctors are always on hand to evaluate them once they get out. NASA astronaut Jeff Williams (left) and Russian cosmonaut Alexey Ovchinin (R) relax after a textbook landing. NASA A record-breaking mission The mission comes the same day a US space probe was cleared for launch on Thursday to collect and return samples from an asteroid in hopes of learning more about the origins of life on Earth and perhaps elsewhere in the solar system, NASA said. Williams, 58, returns to Earth with a career total of 534 days in orbit, more time than any other astronaut in US history and 14th in the world. Welcome home! @Astro_Jeff returned to Earth after US record-breaking @Space_Station mission: https://t.co/DWsir5wsiH pic.twitter.com/aizcDNMGNP — NASA (@NASA) September 7, 2016 The Russians remain champions of long-duration spaceflight, with cosmonaut Gennady Padalka currently the world record-holder with 878 days in space over five missions. Before leaving the station, Williams turned over command of the $100 billion outpost, a project of 15 nations, to cosmonaut Anatoly Ivanishin, who remains aboard the station with NASA astronaut Kate Rubins and Japan's Takuya Onishi. "We'll be missing you here," Ivanishin said during a change-of-command ceremony on Monday. "Have fun riding though the atmosphere ... and have a very safe and exceptionally soft landing." A replacement crew is due to launch on Sept. 23 from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan. A high price tag The US is paying Russia around $70 million to get Williams home. That's how much it costs to send one NASA astronaut to and from the space station now, according to a new report that NASA's Office of Inspector General released on Thursday, Sept. 1, 2016. How much NASA will pay Russia to send US astronauts into space from 2006 through 2018. The cost has increased 372% in 10 years. Skye Gould/Business Insider Thursday also happened to be the day that an unmanned SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket exploded on the launch pad just before a routine test. SpaceX and Boeing are both trying to prove they can launch NASA atronauts from American soil again, but they are at least three years behind schedule, according to the report. The US has had to rely on Russia to ferry our astronauts to and from the floating research lab ever since NASA retired the space shuttle in 2011. Obviously, explosions like SpaceX's could further delay matters, though NASA told Business Insider it was "too early to tell whether Thursday's incident will impact their development schedules." The cost-per-seat should be about $58 million once SpaceX and Boeing develop their astronaut-ready spaceships, Business Insider's Dave Mosher reports. That's still a high price tag, but at least it would be going to American companies instead of a foreign government. Reuters contributed reporting.

The move comes after India was designated a 'major defence partner' of the US in June. Within weeks of that designation, after Prime Minister Narendra Modi met US President Barack Obama at the White House in early June, the Indian Navy had sent an official letter of request (LoR) in February to Department of Defense towards purchase of 22 high-tech multi-mission Predator Guardian UAVs. This was the first major request of arms sale purchase by India after Obama designated New Delhi as a major 'strategic defence partner'. The US government has not made a formal decision on it yet, but is believed to have started an inter agency process on the Indian request. According to sources, the administration believes that an approval of such a major military sale would help in "sealing Indian US defence relationship", bring in "a new level of comfort" between the two militaries and would be considered as a lasting legacy not only for India but also for the Asia-Pacific pivot of the outgoing president. Officials here believe the sale of predator Guardian UAVs would act as a force multiplier for India's maritime surveillance capabilities in the Indian Ocean region; which of late has become one of the key American objective in the Asia Pacific region. Top governmental sources confirmed that Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar and US Defence Secretary Ashton Carter had detailed discussions on predator Guardian UAV to fulfill maritime surveillance requirements. Parrikar was in the US last week and held meetings with Carter at the Pentagon on August 29. During the meeting, Carter is understood have assured Parrikar he would personally "champion" India's request "within the system," sources said. Sources indicate along with the White House, the Pentagon and some influential members of the US are keen to complete the process as soon as possible before Obama leaves his presidency next January. However, a section within the State Department have to be convinced that this is in the interest of the US national security as well. This maritime capability will be a force multiplier for the Indian Navy who has procured other advance technologies including Boeing P-8 aircraft. The Guardian, manufactured by General Atomics, has cutting edge technologies that do not do not exist in the current Indian Navy arsenal.

Korea FOCUS Select Language ALL HEADLINES All Headlines U.S. Air Force training commander visits S. Korea to check locally built jet trainer 2016/09/07 17:24 Tweet Facebook Share Google +1 Reduce Enlarge Print SEOUL, Sept. 7 (Yonhap) -- Lt. Gen. Darryl L. Roberson, the U.S. Air Education and Training Commander, is in South Korea to examine the domestically manufactured TA-50 advanced trainer, the South Korean Air Force said Wednesday. It said the general is expected to examine the manufacturing process of the FA-50 supersonic jet, which is an advanced light attack variant of the TA-50, during his visit to the Korea Aerospace Industries (KAI) factory in Sacheon, 437 kilometers southeast of Seoul, on Thursday. The factory is home to South Korea's sole aircraft maker KAI and can churn out planes for both the South Korean Air Force and foreign customers. The FA-50 like the TA-50 and the T-50 Golden Eagle trainer was co-developed by KAI and U.S. defense firm Lockheed Martin. The TA-50 is a lead-in fighter trainer that can be armed with the AIM-9 Sidewinder and AGM-65 Maverick air-to-ground tactical missiles. South Korea operates the KT-1 basic trainer, the jet-powered T-50 advanced trainer and the TA-50 to train its pilots. Besides inspecting KAI, Roberson will also visit the South Korean Air Force's 16th tactical fighter wing in Yecheon, North Gyeongsang Province, and will fly the TA-50 operated by the air unit there for an hour. Roberson's South Korea visit drew attention as he came ahead of the U.S. Air Force's T-X program, which could lead to an order for some 1,000 jet trainers worth about US$20 billion. The winner of the T-X bid, which will be decided in 2017, is expected to dominate the global trainer jet market, estimated at around US$18 billion over the coming decades. Related to the jet, KAI's export strategy has been two-pronged, with one centered on selling planes like the T-50 jet and its advanced variants, while at the same time exporting key items like wing ribs and bodies to major civilian airplane manufacturers. KAI's other competitor for the T-X bid is a Boeing-Saab consortium, which is expected to offer its own aircraft -- a variant of the JAS-39 -- in the latter half of this year. The South Korean Air Force, meanwhile, said Roberson is responsible for the recruiting, training and education of Air Force personnel.

LeoSat plans to launch a constellation of anywhere between 78 to 108 low-flying communications satellites.  By operating only a few hundred miles above the Earth's surface in low orbit (LEO), LeoSat will be able to deliver faster service than traditional geosynchronous satellites parked at a fixed location 22,500 miles away, with around 20 milliseconds (ms) between ground and a satellite.  Each satellite will use a combination of radio frequency downlinks and laser cross-links to other satellites to provide latency that -- at least on paper – should outperform terrestrial fiber networks  when delivering data from point A to point B around the globe.   The company says it should be able to deliver data between New York to Tokyo at under 130ms while a well-engineered fiber connection between those cities is around 250ms. Along with lower latency than fiber and higher speed than traditional satellite networks, LeoSat's third selling point is a more secure network for moving data, with information encrypted end-to-end and able to travel solely through the satellite network between locations without transiting through a terrestrial station and onto a traditional telecommunications carrier.                    Image via Bigstock Speed will also be a selling point.  LeoSat will offer up to 1.6 Gbps of full-duplex connectivity per link, with 5.2 Gbps "where needed" – most likely available if and when the company launches the top end 108 satellites.   Financial traders are continually looking for any speed edge possible, so the promise of faster-than-fiber service is a no-brainer for hedge funds and other institutions that can gain advantage by processing orders more quickly than competitors.    Other markets the company is pursuing include oil field services and operations, maritime communications, enterprise-enterprise communications, internet and cellular backhaul services, video, and government customers.  LeoSat hopes to start launching the first 84 satellites of its primary network, 78 operational plus 6 on-orbit spares, in 2019 with service availability starting in 2020.  Building the initial satellite network will require up to $3.5 billion. LeoSat is currently talking with various parties to raise $100 million for detailed satellite design and the launch of a pair of pathfinder demonstration satellites that may provide broadband services across Antarctica for National Science Foundation (NSF) researchers at the South Pole. Some might compare LeoSat to other LEO cloud satellite networks, such as OneWeb, but LeoSat is solely focused on the enterprise space.  OneWeb started out in the "broadband for everyone" model, but has more recently shifted to more of a business/cellular carrier focus to get cash flowing in.  OneWeb's network of 648 or so satellites is expected to deliver 50 Mbps per customer with 30ms or so of latency.  The company's backers and partners include Airbus, Bharti, Coca Cola, Qualcomm, and the Virgin Group.  Too little is known about SpaceX and Boeing's LEO plans to provide comparison with OneWeb but both Boeing and SpaceX have filed paperwork with the Federal Communications Commission to reserve radio spectrum and launch pathfinder satellites. Clearly, LeoSat would appear to have an edge in delivering enterprise services.  Now it needs to find the right combination of investors and other financing to start building and launching them.
