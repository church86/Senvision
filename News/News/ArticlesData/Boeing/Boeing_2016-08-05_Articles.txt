As Prime membership soars, Amazon adds planes to arsenal The Washington Post Aug 6, 2016 (…) THE ASSOCIATED PRESS The Boeing 767 “Amazon One” Prime Air cargo plane, unveiled Friday in Seattle, is part of a fleet of 40 jetliners leased by the online retailer for its air cargo network. The Amazon.com logo is on e-readers, tablet computers and countless cardboard boxes on doorsteps. Now, the familiar, swooping arrow is somewhere new: plastered on the side of a Boeing 767. The e-commerce giant on Friday showed off the aircraft that it has dubbed “Amazon One,” a plane that is among a fleet of 40 leased from two air freight companies in an effort to improve a supply chain straining to keep pace with the retailer’s growing sales and its swelling ranks of Prime members. “Creating an air transportation network is expanding our capacity to ensure great delivery speeds for our Prime members for years to come,” Dave Clark, Amazon’s senior vice president of worldwide operations, said in a statement. The move to create its own fleet of planes is part of a broader blitz of investment by Amazon to shore up its delivery capabilities. It has begun experimenting with an Uber-like network of drivers that could deliver packages within local markets such as Baltimore, Miami and Milwaukee. Last year, the company unveiled an Amazon-branded fleet of 4,000 trucking trailers to shuttle its wares. Amazon said its planes and trucking trailers are largely meant to help move goods from one warehouse to another, rather than to facilitate delivery of orders to customers. And, in that way, the company said its forays into the logistics arena are intended to complement the business that it does with UPS and FedEx, not replace them. Yet some analysts wonder whether the buildup of planes, trucking power and drivers should be interpreted as something of a warning shot that Amazon has more ambitious plans to take greater control of the delivery process. Amazon is a major customer of UPS and FedEx, and the shipping firms have shrugged off the idea that the e-commerce giant intends to bypass them. Even if it did, FedEx, for example, has said that no single customer accounts for more than 3 percent of its revenue. Whatever Amazon’s long game is on logistics, it is clear that it was looking to make a splash with the inaugural flight of Amazon One. The company flew the aircraft Friday in the Boeing Seafair Air Show, an annual event near its headquarters in Seattle. The side of the plane is emblazoned with the words “Prime Air,” and its underside features the Amazon logo. The curved Amazon arrow appears on the tail. The plane’s tail number — N1997A — is a prime number, a gimmick that the company said is meant as a nod to its Prime customers. Eleven of its leased planes have been in the air ferrying goods, but this plane is the first to be splashed with Amazon branding. The rest of the fleet will be getting the logo treatment soon. Even as Amazon ventures into new territory with its trucking and air fleets, it continues to make other, more familiar investments in its logistics capabilities. The retailer has famously been plowing millions of dollars into building a network of fulfillment and sorting centers that enable its promise of two-day shipping on Prime orders. In this quarter alone, the company is set to open 18 fulfillment centers, or three times the number that it opened in the same quarter in 2015. The retailer’s aim is to be better prepared for the coming holiday season crush. Last year, fulfillment costs soared in that quarter as demand increased at its warehouses. Jeffrey P. Bezos, chief executive of Amazon, owns the Washington Post.

All passengers and crew escaped from the Boeing Co. 777-300 following the 12:45pm explosion on Flight 521 from Thiruvananthapuram, India. A firefighter was killed trying to extinguish the blaze, Emirates chairman Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum said at an evening news conference in Dubai. Chairman Sheikh Ahmed: The trouble with the flight was ‘operationa’. — Reuters file picThe trouble with the flight was “operational,” he said, adding he didn’t believe there was any security issue. The pilot might have attempted a so-called go-around — that is, aborting the landing — to avoid wind shear, but that hadn’t been verified, Sheikh Ahmed said. The airport had issued a wind-shear warning for all runways before the accident, according to the AviationSafetyNetwork website. The condition occurs when wind direction changes abruptly. In extreme cases, it can be severe enough that a plane will lose lift and plunge. “It’s difficult to speculate about what happened in the last few minutes of the flight, but I want to thank the crew for their professionalism and evacuating the plane in a short time,” Sheikh Ahmed said. The pilot and co-pilot had logged more than 7,000 of flying hours each, he said. Cockpit instructions Flight 521 had been cleared to land at Dubai, according to a transcript of an air-traffic control recording obtained by LiveATC.net. About a minute and a-half later, the tower gave a new instruction. “Emirates 521 climb straight ahead to 4,000 feet” (1,200 metres), a controller said, a command acknowledged by the pilot. The reason for the order wasn’t known. Typically, such instructions are issued after pilots request to abort touchdowns. Television footage and newswire photos showed that the aircraft slid to a halt on its belly, with one of its huge Rolls-Royce engines detached. The jet then quickly became engulfed in smoke and fire, which gutted the length of the fuselage and burned off the roof. The jumbo jet carried 282 passengers and 18 crew members, according to Emirates, the world’s biggest carrier by international traffic. Emergency services sprayed down the plane to put out the fire. Passengers and crew hurried to safety down inflatable slides. Thirteen people were hospitalized with minor injuries, Sheikh Ahmed said. Dubai airport, the world’s third-busiest by passenger numbers, shut down shortly after the crash and reopened at 6:30 p.m. on a restricted basis, giving priority to arriving flights. Investigation teams The US National Transportation Safety Board is sending a five-person team to assist with the investigation, a spokesman said. Under a United Nations treaty, the government from where the plane was manufactured is invited to participate in a probe. Despite the reported winds, the pilots should have been able to land the plane — or climb to safety if they were uncomfortable with the situation, said John Cox, president of Safety Operating Systems and a former airline pilot. “Professional pilots deal with high winds and gusty winds on a regular basis,” Cox said in an interview. “It’s like cruise-ship captains. You are going to have to learn to dock that thing when it’s calm or when winds are at 40 knots.” At this point, investigators won’t rule anything out, looking at weather conditions, possible pilot missteps and potential failures of aircraft systems, he said. The aircraft involved entered service in 2003 and was current for regular maintenance and inspections, Sheikh Ahmed. ‘Belly Flop’ John Nance, a former commercial and US Air Force pilot who has flown a 777, said videos from the scene indicate that the landing gear may not have been fully deployed when Flight 521 touched down. “This is a situation where it looks very much like the aircraft was landing with gear up. It does appear this was a belly flop,” he said. “Why is a good question, especially if the aircraft was ordered to go around.” Boeing’s 777 model is the largest twin-engine airliner in production and the most used wide-body. Emirates is the biggest operator of the plane as well as of Airbus Group SE’s A380 double-decker. The Boeing aircraft is also one of the safest, with only a handful suffering irreparable damage since the model’s introduction two decades ago, including incidents caused by war or pilot error, according to Aviation Safety Network. Rolls-Royce engine Boeing is standing by with a technical team to help US authorities investigating the accident, the US planemaker said on its website. Rolls-Royce Holdings Plc, which made the jet’s Trent 800 engines, also said it was ready to take part in the probe. Wednesday’s 3½-hour flight started midmorning from Thiruvananthapuram on India’s southwest coast. Emirates serves the region mainly to ferry Indian workers to jobs in the Middle East. The carrier has built its business on exploiting the Persian Gulf’s position at the heart of intercontinental flight paths and the region’s oil industry, building Dubai into an airport that served 78 million passengers last year, making the hub the world’s biggest by international traffic. The carrier’s success has put pressure on earnings at European network airlines including Air France-KLM Group and Deutsche Lufthansa AG. — Bloomberg                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Tough general convinces Trump to backtrack on torture Far-right loner jailed for life in murder of British MP Egypt’s Sisi expresses support for Syrian military Turkey throws out child sex bill after outcry Israel minister doesn’t expect Mideast move by Obama Trump’s daughter Ivanka sits in on landmark Japan PM talks Clinton: Election exposed deep divisions in the US Journalist arrested in Morocco for report on cannabis Trump demands apology over 'Hamilton' slight (VIDEO) Confusion over Trump's first talks with foreign leader (VIDEO) Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: China goes global as Trump puts America first Reuters Video: Facebook crafts censorship tool to re-enter China, says NYT Kids and parents react to 'Beauty and the Beast' MMOTV: Mahathir, Siti Hasmah head to KLCC by car MMOTV: Red Shirts heckle yellow-shirted Bersih participants MMOTV: A Red Shirts supporter hurls abuse at Bersih supporters Related Articles Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2016 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | RecomN - Local Services

Fiji Time: 7:26 AM on Thursday 24 November Home Politics Local Sport World Letters Editorial Nai Lalakai Business Features Classifieds Weather Gallery Archives / Front page / Business Lobby campaign against Boeing, Airbus deals Reuters Saturday, August 06, 2016 As the US Treasury Department decides whether to licence sales of Boeing Co and Airbus commercial aircraft to Iran, opponents of last year's nuclear pact with the Islamic republic have launched a lobbying campaign against the deals. The international agreement to curb Iran's nuclear program made such sales possible by easing sanctions on Tehran, but some members of the US Congress who oppose it want to block proposed sales of some 200 jetliners, worth about $US50 billion ($F102b) at list prices, to renew Iran Air's aging fleet. While the lawmakers oppose any action that could boost the Tehran Government, they also argue that Iran could use passenger aircraft for military purposes such as transporting fighters to battle US troops or allies in Syria or elsewhere. Boeing and Airbus, the world's two largest planemakers, struck provisional agreements with the Iranian carrier earlier this year. The Republican-majority Congress could pass legislation to block the sales even if the Treasury Department approved them. The House of Representatives last month passed two amendments that would have stopped the sales, although to become law they would have to be approved by the Senate and signed by President Barack Obama, a Democrat. This week, the Foundation for Defence of Democracies, a Washington foreign policy research group, which has criticised the nuclear pact and advocated tougher sanctions on Iran, organised letters signed by dozens of national security figures expressing concern about the aircraft sales and promising to increase pressure on Congress. "This deal ... represents a legitimisation of a State Sponsor of Terror and a direct benefit for a ruling regime responsible for gross human rights abuses, support for terrorism including threats against the US and its allies," said the letters to Dennis Muilenburg, Boeing's chairman, and Fabrice Bregier, CEO of Airbus' plane manufacturing unit. The 42 signers included former Secretary of State George Shultz, former CIA director Michael Hayden and former US Senator Joseph Lieberman.

(Hainan Airlines) First Las Vegas-China flights slated for December Hainan Airlines announces it will begin nonstop round trips between Beijing Capital and McCarran international airports beginning in December. (Hainan Airlines Global/Facebook) By RICHARD N. VELOTTA and NICOLE RAZ LAS VEGAS REVIEW-JOURNAL State and local officials have worked for nearly two decades to get nonstop flights between Las Vegas and China. Those efforts paid off Thursday when Hainan Airlines — China’s largest privately owned commercial air carrier — filed an application with the U.S. Department of Transportation to begin flights between McCarran International Airport and Beijing Capital International Airport in December, the airline announced. Hainan Airline’s service to Beijing is the second nonstop trans-Pacific route connecting Las Vegas with Asia. Korean Air flies four times a week between McCarran and Seoul, South Korea. Hainan will fly the Beijing route three times a week on 213-seat twin-engine Boeing 787 Dreamliner jets, the second international carrier to use the newest addition to the Boeing fleet in service to Las Vegas. Norwegian Air also flies the 787, lauded by many as one of the most comfortable jets in the sky, on its international routes. Hainan Vice President Hou Wei, who has worked on establishing the Las Vegas route for two years, said Las Vegas has become a top tourist destination for Chinese travelers because of the vibrancy, excitement and culture of the city.   “Las Vegas’ investment in hotels, shops and attractions that are geared toward Chinese travelers ensure that Chinese visitors will continue to come to Las Vegas and support this economy,” Hou said. New reciprocal 10-year tourist visas and “China ready” programs have helped resorts to develop amenities geared to Chinese visitors. Highlighting the increased cultural exchange, the announcement Thursday at the Cromwell featured a video of dragon dancing filmed by the Las Vegas Lohan School of Shaolin.   The three-times-a-week schedule means “tremendous growth” for the Las Vegas economy, said Rossi Ralenkotter, president and CEO of the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority. Chinese tourists are among the fastest-growing and largest-spending groups of international travelers to Las Vegas. “Right now we get about 170,000 Chinese visitors a year, which is over $200 million in economic impact,” Ralenkotter said. A convenient nonstop travel opportunity to Las Vegas means visitors begin their stay in Vegas, and spend more money here. “International visitors stay longer. Many of them — when they come to the United States — they’ll spend ten, 12, 15 days,” Ralenkotter said, adding that the direct flight also provides an opportunity for Vegas to compete directly for the Chinese market. The millions of dollars that are dropped in the city will translate to an economic boost. Clark County Commissioner Steve Sisolak said the boost in tourism from China will create jobs in Southern Nevada. “It keeps heads in beds,” he said. “The money circulates over and over again. Ultimately it gets into our education system, our parks, our police force, all those sorts of things that make it a better community for all of us.” Clark County Director of Aviation Rosemary Vassiliadis said Vegas can expect a “tremendous” increase in visitation with the new nonstop flight. “We know how high the demand has been. It’s the most populous country in the world and, Las Vegas being the No. 1 destination in the world, it’s just a perfect fit,” she said. The new route is part of Hainan’s large-scale expansion of flights to and from North America. The airline already flies routes between Beijing and Seattle; Boston; San Jose, California; Chicago’s O’Hare International Airport; Calgary, Alberta; and Toronto, Ontario. It also has flights between Los Angeles International and Changsha, and Seattle and Boston to Shanghai. “Hainan’s award-winning service and elite experience complement the dynamism and vibrancy of Las Vegas,” Hou said. “This is a further reflection of our long-term commitment to our customers in China and the U.S.” There were indications earlier this year that Hainan’s announcement was coming. In April, the Civil Aviation Administration of China approved Hainan’s’ request to fly three round trips a week between Beijing and Las Vegas beginning in September. The airline is then required to take the request to the U.S. Department of Transportation for approval. That’s the step that was announced Thursday. When an airline files an application, the department establishes public comment periods of either 15 or 21 days. The Department of Transportation then weighs several factors in determining whether the application is in the public interest. The timing of an approval is driven by whether there are responses filed to the application or if the application involves any bilateral agreements between the affected countries. For example, when Hainan filed for authority to serve Chicago’s O’Hare International Airport from Beijing in June 2013, there were no objections filed and the application was approved one month later. Flights between Las Vegas and Beijing will begin Dec. 2 once the Department of Transportation approves the route, which is expected to be a formality. Hainan will fly Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, leaving McCarran at 12:30 p.m., arriving in Beijing at 5:30 p.m., the next day. Return flights will leave Capital Airport at 2:20 p.m., and arrive in Las Vegas at 10:30 a.m., the same day because the flight crosses the international dateline. The eastbound flight takes about 12 hours and the westbound flight 13 hours. The airline’s business class seats feature lie-flat beds. Contact Richard N.

WORK TO LAND CHINA FLIGHTS UNDERWAY FOR YEARS Most of the initial work of coaxing an airline to fly nonstop between China and Las Vegas began in the early 2000s when then-Lt. Govs. Lorraine Hunt-Bono and Brian Krolicki traveled to Beijing to meet with airline executives about the prospect of flying directly to McCarran. The state, which opened an office of tourism in Beijing in 2003, sold the idea that using Las Vegas as an international port of entry was better for customers because lines are longer and entry offices busier in Los Angeles, San Francisco and Seattle. Most of the major U.S. air carriers have hubs on the West Coast and won't overfly them to Las Vegas as a matter of efficiency. But the Chinese carriers could use that competitively with Chinese tourists who want to visit Las Vegas and the American Southwest. "I'm so proud of what everybody has done on this," said Hunt-Bono, credited as the first public official to boost attracting tourists from China to Nevada. "It was a team effort and when I left office, Lt. Govs. Krolicki and (Mark) Hutchison carried the torch. The LVCVA and McCarran then brought it to the finish line," said Hunt-Bono, a former member of the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority board of directors. "Establishing nonstop air service to China has been the Holy Grail of Nevada tourism for decades," Krolicki said in an interview. "Visitation from China (to the United States) was at about 100,000 15 years ago and now it's in seven figures," Krolicki said. "We knew the 787 Dreamliner was going to be a game-changer for cities like Las Vegas and with this announcement, it truly has." A team of airline development officials with the LVCVA, McCarran and consultant Ailevon Pacific Airline Consulting kept negotiations with Chinese air carriers on the front burner. They met with them several times at World Routes conferences, events at which one-on-one meetings between airports and destination marketing organizations with airline executives are scheduled in a "speed dating" format. The conference that may have put Las Vegas over the top occurred in 2013 when the city hosted the first World Routes conference ever staged in North America. The airline development team knew they were close to getting Hainan when the company announced the approval of the Chinese aviation officials in April.

But the more significant number is that combined orders for the two were down 17 percent from the same period last year, with the aviation market somewhat oversupplied. As James Bevan, Chief Investment Officer at CCLA Investment Management, explained: “There are two challenges that they face in terms of order flow. First of all the number of airlines that want to have fleets for national pride purposes is clearly declining as the global economy remains weak. Secondly there has been consolidation in terms of airlines wanting to co-participate in routes as evidenced by the Quantas/Emirates deal." Backlogs but also vulnerability The order slowdown, and an increasing number of deferrals of orders by airlines in recent weeks, is raising questions over whether the two dominant planemakers will stick with their plans to boost output in the coming years. The audit and consultancy firm Deloitte has concluded that 13 percent of the industry’s massive order book is vulnerable to deferral or cancellation. Even though Airbus and Boeing have production backlogs of six to 10 years based on their current order book totals, James Bevan said future profitability for both companies must be based on renewal and repair. Our editors discuss why demand for Boeing 747s and Airbus A380s has slowed (Podcast) https://t.co/1teHevMjTO pic.twitter.com/pcoGlTnCMR— Aviation Week (@AviationWeek) August 1, 2016 Flying high – the numbers Airbus said it had sold a total of 373 jets between January and July, or 323 after adjusting for cancellations. That compares with 383 airplane sales, or 333 after cancellations, by Boeing. Recent cancellations Two industry sources said Indonesia’s Lion Air, one of the largest jet buyers with hundreds on order from Boeing and Airbus, is weighing the deferral of about 25 Airbus jets. Airbus declined comment and Lion Air was not available. Mexican low-cost carrier Interjet has canceled five of 40 A320neo jets it has on order, according to an Airbus monthly update. An Interjet spokeswoman said the change was part of an “operational swap,” without giving further details. New Airbus data also incorporated the cancellation by Qatar Airways of the first of 50 A320neo-family jets it has ordered. The Doha-based airline airline pulled out because of delays caused by issues with the plane’s Pratt & Whitney engines. Qatar is reportedly talking to Boeing about buying as many as 30 of its 737 Max jets instead. Australian airline Qantas has also said it has no plans to buy any more Airbus A380s. It has 12 of the double-decker superjumbos in service and Airbus has eight more still listed on its order books for delivery to Qantas.

IRAN DEAL: “Obama Defends Cash Payment to Iran” by Carol Lee and Jay Solomon: “Mr. Obama dismissed the significance of the payment method, saying it’s gaining attention “maybe because it feels like some spy novel or some crime novel.” He said the timing wasn’t because it was a ransom payment for the release of prisoners, but because the U.S. was having diplomatic conversations with Iran for the first time in decades… The president also pointed out that the nuclear deal has been working for over a year despite initial warnings and pessimistic predictions that the Iranians would violate the terms of the agreement. “It’s not just the assessment of our intelligence community, it’s the assessment of the Israeli military and intelligence community – the country that was most opposed to this deal that acknowledges that this has been a game changer and that Iran has abided by the deal, and that they no longer have the sort of short-term breakout capacity that would allow them to develop nuclear weapons.”[WSJ; NYT; JewishInsider] "Hostage: We couldn’t leave until second plane landed in Iran" by Joe Tacopino: "One of the American hostages who was released the day the United States sent $400 million to Iran said his plane to freedom was not allowed to take off until “another plane” arrived in Tehran, according to a report. Pastor Saeed Abedini, who was among four Americans released this past Jan. 17, told Fox Business he wound up waiting for an extended time for the second plane to reach the Iranian capital and was never told why the arriving aircraft was so important." [NYPost] "The $400 Million: Legal but Not Right" by Michael Mukasey: "Why cash, and why in an unmarked cargo plane? How come the U.S. did not simply transfer the $400 million we are told actually belonged to Iran to a foreign entity, to be converted into foreign funds for conventional banking transmission to Tehran? That would have permitted the U.S. to keep track of how Iran spent the money, at least to some extent... The apparent explanation isn’t pretty. There is principally one entity within the Iranian government that has need of untraceable funds. That entity is the Quds Force—the branch of Iran’s Revolutionary Guards Corps focused particularly on furthering the regime’s goals world-wide by supporting and conducting terrorism." [WSJ] “GOP Congressman Wonders Whether Obama Is A Secret Agent For 'Some Other Team'” by Matt Fuller: “When deals like this are cut,” Zeldin said in a press release Wednesday, “one has to truly wonder whether the President has no idea what he is doing, or if he knows exactly what he is doing and is playing for some other team.” [HuffPost] J Street called on Zeldin to retract and apologize for accusing President Obama of dual loyalty: “The thinly veiled insinuation that President Obama is acting out of loyalty to some entity outside the United States is appalling and unbecoming for a member of the United States Congress… Elected officials have and will continue to have disagreements over the merits of the Iran nuclear deal and the President’s foreign policy. But when those disagreements move beyond the realm of reasoned argument and become attacks on the basic integrity and loyalty of the President, an inviolable line has been crossed.”  “Iran nuclear pact opponents lobby in U.S. against Boeing, Airbus deals” by Patricia Zengerle: “This week, the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, which has criticized the nuclear pact and advocated tougher sanctions on Iran, organized letters signed by dozens of national security figures expressing concern about the aircraft sales and promising to increase pressure on Congress. "This deal ... represents a legitimization of a State Sponsor of Terror and a direct benefit for a ruling regime responsible for gross human rights abuses, support for terrorism including threats against the U.S. and its allies," said the letters to Dennis Muilenburg, Boeing's chairman, and Fabrice Brégier, chief executive of Airbus' plane manufacturing unit. The 42 signers included former Secretary of State George Shultz, former CIA Director Michael Hayden and former U.S. Senator Joseph Lieberman.” [Reuters] Conference of Presidents’ statement: “We welcome the analysis from an esteemed group of former top national security officials with decades of experience in defense, intelligence and national security policy-making warning of the dangers inherent in the decisions of Airbus and Boeing to sell aircraft to Iran… We hope Airbus and Boeing will seriously consider the points made in the letter and reassess their decisions to move forward with the sales at this time.” “Trump AGAIN insists he's seen video of $400 million Iran cash-drop even though his campaign admitted it was Fox News 'b-roll' of a different plane” by David Martosko: “On Wednesday Trump's campaign quickly walked back his claim in a Daytona Beach, Florida rally about professional-quality video that Iranians had released to embarrass the U.S., admitting he had only seen 'b-roll' – archival footage – that showed the Americans emerging from a different aircraft in Geneva Switzerland. But in Maine, Trump again insisted that the video he had described was real. 'A tape was made, right? You saw that, with the plane coming in. Nice plane. And the airplane coming in. And the money coming off, I guess, right?' Trump asked a capacity crowd in a Portland theater.” [DailyMail] Trump Tweets: "The plane I saw on television was the hostage plane in Geneva, Switzerland, not the plane carrying $400 million in cash going to Iran!" [Twitter] “Trump Declines To Name Women He’d Put In His Cabinet Besides Daughter Ivanka” by Andrew Kaczynski: “I can tell you everybody would say, ‘Put Ivanka in, put Ivanka in,’ you know that, right?” Trump said. “She’s very popular, she’s done very well, and you know Ivanka very well. But there really are so many that are really talented people — like you, you’re so talented, but I don’t know if your viewers know that.” [BuzzFeed] “Joe Lieberman: This Presidential Campaign is a War: Former Independent Party Connecticut Senator Joe Lieberman says he still hasn’t made up his mind on which candidate he plans to back for president. Lieberman, who was the Democratic vice presidential candidate in 2000, added: “I may get involved as time goes on. I’m one of those people, and there’re a lot of us I think, who can’t feel quite comfortable either way yet.”” [FoxBusiness] “In slap at Trump, some wealthy Republicans campaign for Clinton” by Olivia Oran and Amanda Becker: “Spearheading in part the Clinton effort to woo Republicans on Wall Street is Democratic strategist Leslie Dach, a former Walmart executive and aide to Bill Clinton, sources close to the Clinton campaign said.” [Reuters] Dan Senor on WADR: “There is more panic now than I have ever seen before… I am just hearing from more and more members - for instance from the house - who say, ‘Maybe I should unendorse.’ I don’t know if they will. My gut tells me that’s not going to happen.” [Yahoo] "Republicans are among a new list of foreign policy experts denouncing Trump" by Anne Gearan: “Several Republicans are among a group of former cabinet officers, senior officials and career military officers who denounced Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump on Thursday, calling his recent remarks on the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and Russia “disgraceful.” The letter does not endorse Clinton or mention her apart from the email issue. Many of the Democrats who signed on to the letter have separately endorsed Clinton, as has at least one of the Republican signatories, foreign policy expert Kori Schake.” [WashPost; Letter]  TOP TALKER: "I Ran the C.I.A. Now I’m Endorsing Hillary Clinton" by Michael J. Morell:"Two strongly held beliefs have brought me to this decision. First, Mrs. Clinton is highly qualified to be commander in chief. I trust she will deliver on the most important duty of a president — keeping our nation safe. Second, Donald J.

The meeting was run and organized by volunteers Tally Zingher and Jonathan Morgenstein, a veteran who served in Iraq with the US Marine Corps. Speaking by phone while manning a Democrats Abroad booth at an exhibition, Morgenstein said that along with enthusiasm for Clinton, there were many people who have told him they intend to vote just in order to help Trump lose.” [JPost] Rep. Ted Deutch writes... "Several weeks ago, I visited Jerusalem and Ramallah. While Israeli citizens were mourning the murder of a teenage girl at the hands of a terrorist, their elected officials, in the Netanyahu government and across the Knesset, continued to debate how to achieve a two-state solution that can lead to peace. Left to right, Jewish, Arab and Druze, the debate in the Israeli parliament and among Israeli citizens is passionate and often quite contentious. Sound familiar? Like America, Israel is a vibrant democracy. Too often, the world ignores that reality. Hillary Clinton recognizes it, and at this moment of increased anti-Semitism, a growing and dangerous BDS campaign and the demonization of Israel, she will stand with all of us who support Israel and its quest for peace." [SunSentinel] “Wasserman Schultz denounces DNC emails over Bernie Sanders’ faith” by Alex Daugherty and Patricia Mazzei: “There was one very unfortunate, unacceptable, outrageous email exchange — that I was not a party to — that discussed using Sen. Sanders’ faith, a faith which I share,” said Wasserman Schultz, who like Sanders is Jewish. “I haven’t perused all the emails, but even in that exchange, one of the staff acknowledged I, as chair, would never be OK with that.” “Wasserman Schultz denied a Politico report that she asked Vice President Joe Biden for a video to play at her daughter’s bat mitzvah. “Not true,” she said. “I really don’t think it’s appropriate for me to be responding to anonymous criticism. If people don’t have the nerve to be critical and put their name to it, then I’m not going to box nameless, faceless critics.”” [MiamiHerald] David Kustoff Wins TN GOP Primary For U.S. House District 8 -- by Kim Chaney: "The race for the Tennessee Republican primary for U.S. House District 8 has been one of the most highly contested in the Mid-South. Thursday night, David Kustoff beat out 12 other candidates who were vying for the seat being vacated by Rep.

The latest push to speed delivery of its products comes as the company ships an increasing number of packages worldwide. Amazon's parcel volume was an estimated 1 billion packages in 2015. By way of comparison, in the 2016 fiscal year FedEx delivered about 3 billion packages for hundreds of thousands of customers. Amazon has had issues with the reliability of air freight services. In 2013, it offered refunds to customers who received their Christmas orders late after bad weather and a jump in online shopping caused delays for UPS and FedEx.

(AP Photo/Ted S. Warren) Analysts say it makes sense for Amazon to use an air fleet it controls as another way to get its products to online shoppers drawn to fast, no-extra-cost delivery. "They're such a big online retailer," said Satish Jindel, president of shipping consultant ShipMatrix. "There's so much volume that if you have to add transportation for yourself, why would you pay a retail price when you can get wholesale? It makes sense." Amazon revealed its first branded "Prime Air" cargo plane, designated Amazon One, on Friday at the annual Seafair Air Show. The plane buzzed over Seattle's Lake Washington just before the Navy's Blue Angels took to the skies. Amazon leased 40 Boeing jets from Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings and Air Transport Services Group Inc., which will operate the air cargo network. Eleven of the planes already are delivering packages for Amazon's annual Prime loyalty program, which offers free two-day shipping and other perks. The remaining freighters will be rolled out in the next couple of years. Aircraft like Amazon One allow the company to "continue to maintain our fast delivery speeds and lower our costs as our Prime base and our Prime member growth continue to soar," said Dave Clark, Amazon's senior vice president of worldwide operations. Despite its growing fleet of aircraft, Amazon said it plans to continue to use FedEx, UPS and other transportation partners. "Because of our growth and the sheer amount of packages, we are supplementing our transportation needs," Clark said. The company has been furiously building out distribution centers, where workers and robots pull products off shelves and package them for delivery, as well as smaller sorting plants, which arrange packages by ZIP code for faster delivery. It has a network of more than 125 fulfillment centers worldwide. Amazon recently reported a second-quarter profit of $857 million on $30 billion in revenue. The company doesn't yet have plans to carry packages for others but says it's constantly evaluating its situation. Amazon has not been shy about competing in businesses areas far-flung from its e-commerce roots. "Once you have those planes, it certainly creates the opportunity for new products for customers," Clark said, adding: "Stay tuned and we'll see what happens in the future." ___ This story has been updated to remove an incorrect reference to the number of packages FedEx delivered in 2012.

IW500/9) issued a new 20-year regional market forecast for aircraft demand in Russia and the CIS region, predicting a need for 1,170 new aircraft by 2035 – a total pegged at $140 billion. “Russia and CIS region continues to have a strong commercial aerospace market,” stated Sergey Kravchenko, president, Boeing Russia and CIS. For perspective, Boeing’s 20-year outlook for global aircraft demand sees a need for 39,620 new airplanes, with the Russia/CIS region representing nearly 3% of total global demand. Related Airbus Sees Russia/CIS Market Demand at $150 Billion Boeing Set New Record for Aircraft Deliveries in 2015 The Confederation of Independent States (CIS) is a loose association of former Soviet republics with nominal authority in trade, finance, lawmaking, and security. Along with Russia, the full members are Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan. Georgia, Turkmenistan, and Ukraine are former Soviet republics, but are not CIS member states. Russia has a major aircraft manufacturer of its own, mainly consisting of former Soviet design and manufacturing enterprises for civilian and military jets, now consolidated as United Aircraft Corp., and similar set-ups producing helicopters, and smaller aircraft. Just under a year ago, Boeing’s rival jet-builder Airbus issued a 20-year forecast for Russia and the CIS region, predicting demand for 1,280 new aircraft, and valuing that demand at $150 billion.

The online retailing giant plans to unveil its first branded cargo plane, dubbed Amazon One, to the public at the Seattle Seafair Air Show on Friday. It is the first of 40 planes that will make up the company's fleet, aimed to remove the middlemen for long distance deliveries. Amazon has revealed its latest weapon in its quest to make delivery for its Prime customers even quicker - a Boeing 767-300 The move will speed up the fulfillment of Amazon orders as the company ships an increasing number of packages worldwide. Amazon's senior vice president of worldwide operations, Dave Clark, explained aircraft like Amazon One allow the company to 'continue to maintain our fast delivery speeds and lower our costs as our Prime base and our Prime member growth continue to soar.'

Share this article Share Last year an estimated one billion packages were transported by Amazon - the same number FedEx delivered three years earlier to its hundred of thousands of customers.  It is believed the company is the first retail business to create its own air cargo fleet to transports it products across the world.    Amazon will hope that by taking delivery in house it will not have a repeat of reliability issues it has suffered in the past. The online retailing giant plans to unveil its first branded cargo plane, dubbed Amazon One, to the public at the Seattle’s Seafair Air Show on Friday It is the first of 40 planes that will make up the company's fleet aimed to remove the middlemen for long distance deliveries It was forced to offer refunds to customers who received their Christmas orders late in 2013 after bad weather and a jump in online shopping caused delays for UPS and FedEx. Analysts say it makes sense for Amazon to use an air fleet it controls as another way to get its products to online shoppers drawn to fast, no-extra-cost delivery. Satish Jindel, president of shipping consultant ShipMatrix, said: 'They're such a big online retailer. There's so much volume that if you have to add transportation for yourself, why would you pay a retail price when you can get wholesale? It makes sense.' The company's first branded 'Prime Air' cargo plane will fly over Seattle's Lake Washington, just before the Navy's Blue Angels take to the skies on Friday afternoon at the city's famous air show. The move will speed up delivery of Amazon's products as the company ships an increasing number of packages worldwide Amazon has leased 40 Boeing jets from Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings and Air Transport Services Group Inc., which will operate the air cargo network.  Eleven of the planes already are delivering packages for Amazon's annual Prime loyalty program, which offers free two-day shipping and other perks. The remaining freighters will be rolled out over the next couple of years.  Despite its growing fleet of aircraft, Amazon said it plans to continue to use FedEx, UPS and other transportation partners. 'Because of our growth and the sheer amount of packages, we are supplementing our transportation needs,' Clark said. Amazon's senior vice president of worldwide operations, Dave Clark, explained aircraft like Amazon One allow the company to 'continue to maintain our fast delivery speeds and lower our costs as our Prime base and our Prime member growth continue to soar.' Last year an estimated one billion packages were transported by Amazon - the same number FedEx delivered three years earlier to its hundred of thousands of customers The company has been furiously building distribution centers, where workers and robots pull products off shelves and package them for delivery, as well as smaller sorting plants, which arrange packages by ZIP code for faster delivery. It has a network of more than 125 fulfillment centers worldwide. Amazon recently reported a second-quarter profit of $857 million on $30 billion in revenue. The company doesn't yet have plans to carry packages for others but says it's constantly evaluating its situation. Amazon has not been shy about competing in businesses areas far-flung from its e-commerce roots. 'Once you have those planes, it certainly creates the opportunity for new products for customers,' Clark said, adding: 'Stay tuned and we'll see what happens in the future.'  Amazon will hope that by taking delivery in house it will not have a repeat of reliabilty issues it has suffered in the past Share or comment on this article e-mail 77 shares Most watched News videos Gruesome moment Korean chef dissects a LIVE octopus Mob storm police station and lynch suspected paedophile Teen films a burning 'meteorite' moving across sky in Japan Cyclist films moment car causes him to crash then drives away Shocking moment man hits women in mass chicken shop fight Supermodel Gigi Hadid fights off man who grabs her at Milan show Mystery homeless woman in Rome avoids questions from reporter Kim Kardashian attacked in Paris by notorious prankster The moment a 7.4 magnitude earthquake hit Fukushima 100 special police agents protect suspected paedophile from mob Doorman knocks-out troublemaker during two-on-one confrontation Kanye West hospitalized 'for his own health and safety' Six rebel electors have signed an agreement to try to block...

Associated Press   In this June 14, 2016, photo, trainee reservist officers from the Territorial Defense Command speak to a citizen about the importance of voting on the upcoming referendum in Bangkok, Thailand. On Sunday, Thailand is holding a referendum on a new constitution drafted by the military government with none of the trappings of democracy: no rallies, no campaigns and virtually no debate. After all, the new constitution, if approved, would allow the junta to keep it in control for several years and enshrine a watered-down democracy. Associated Press   A Boeing 767, an Amazon.com "Prime Air" cargo plane is parked on display Thursday, Aug. 4, 2016, in a Boeing hangar in Seattle. Amazon unveiled its first branded cargo plane Thursday, one of 40 jetliners that will make up Amazon's own air transportation network of 40 Boeing jets leased from Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings and Air Transport Services Group Inc., which will operate the air cargo network.

REUTERS/Ahmed Jadallah Reuters/Ahmed Jadallah Thursday, Aug 04, 2016 Dubai The investigation into what caused an Emirates Boeing 777 with 300 people on board to catch fire at Dubai International will take three to five months, according to the UAE’s federal aviation authority. The 282 passengers and 18 crew on board flight EK521 from Thiruvananthapuram in southern India escaped the aircraft before flames gutted the jet on Wednesday. A firefighter died tackling the blaze and there were 13 injuries, including five passengers and one crew member, according to Emirates. The GCAA (General Civil Aviation Authority) has mobilised a team to investigate the incident and recover the aircraft’s black boxes. The investigation will be assisted by Emirates, Boeing and engine maker Rolls Royce, the GCAA said Wednesday, A GCAA spokesperson told Gulf News on Thursday that the investigation would take between three and five months to complete, calling the length of time “normal procedure.” Emirates referred a question on the duration of the investigation to the GCAA. A preliminary report would be issued within one month of the incident, it said later in a statement. Advertisement A three to five month investigation period “for a crash of this nature,” is routine, according to, Mark Martin, an aviation analyst and founder of Dubai-based Martin Consultancy who said he has worked as a consultant with the GCAA in the past. He said an investigation typically begins with the retrieval of flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder (CVR), commonly known as the “black boxes.” “And then the plane is put together in a hangar and all its parts are pieced together” to be able to try and establish what happened. Asked if he expected international investigators such as National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) to be involved, Martin said: “I would like to see the NTSB involved ... There would definitely be experts from Boeing and Rolls-Royce involved in the investigations.” The 777 is widely accepted as one of the safest aircrafts ever made, with very few having been involved in incidents where the aircraft was damaged beyond repair. In a note on Wednesday, Martin said that the “hard impact [on] the ground may likely have been as a result of an unstable approach.” According to flight tracking website flightradar24, the 13-year-old Boeing 777-300 came in to landing at a speed of 155 knots (287 kilometres), slightly higher than Boeing’s recommended 149 knots approach speed. The aircraft then increased its speed to 180 knots within seconds whilst continue its descent before coming to a halt. Emirates chairman and chief executive Shaikh Ahmad Bin Saeed Al Maktoum at press conference on Wednesday said that the Australian and Emirati pilots may have tried to abort the initial landing attempt due to wind shear, which is a sudden change in wind direction. But he was unable to comment on the discussions between the cockpit and air traffic control in Dubai leading up to the incident. A passenger who was on board told Gulf News that there was no indication anything was wrong as they were coming into and land. After the flight landed there was “shaking and then a big bump” and “we dropped suddenly,” Indian national G. Jagadeesh told Gulf News. Other media have reported that the pilots told the passengers that there was an issue with the aircraft’s landing gear and that they would be making an emergency landing. The incident is the worst in Emirates’ 31-year history and the first time the airline has had one of its aircraft damaged beyond repair. Emirates has described what took place as an “incident” and an “accident.” The GCAA said the aircraft was making an “emergency landing.” The flight closed Dubai International, the Middle East’s busiest airport, for several hours on Wednesday and reopened later that day with only one of its two runways operational. Emirates said Thursday it expects flight disruptions across its network for the next 36 hours and that 23,000 of its passengers were impacted by the incident. Hundreds of flights were cancelled or delayed on Wednesday and Thursday. - With inputs from Fasial Masudi, Staff Reporter and Michael Coetzee, Web News Editor by Shweta Jain Deputy Business Editor Alexander Cornwell Staff Reporter Gulf News 2016. All rights reserved. © Copyright Zawya.

The international agreement to curb Iran's nuclear program made such sales possible by easing sanctions on Tehran, but some members of the U.S. Congress who oppose it want to block proposed sales of some 200 jetliners, worth about $50 billion at list prices, to renew Iran Air's aging fleet. While the lawmakers oppose any action that could boost the Tehran government, they also argue that Iran could use passenger aircraft for military purposes such as transporting fighters to battle US troops or allies in Syria or elsewhere. Boeing and Airbus, the world's two largest planemakers, struck provisional agreements with the Iranian carrier earlier this year. The Republican-majority Congress could pass legislation to block the sales even if the Treasury Department approved them. The House of Representatives last month passed two amendments that would have stopped the sales, although to become law they would have to be approved by the Senate and signed by President Barack Obama, a Democrat. This week, the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a Washington foreign policy research group, which has criticised the nuclear pact and advocated tougher sanctions on Iran, organised letters signed by dozens of national security figures expressing concern about the aircraft sales and promising to increase pressure on Congress. "This deal ... represents a legitimisation of a State Sponsor of Terror and a direct benefit for a ruling regime responsible for gross human rights abuses, support for terrorism including threats against the US and its allies," said the letters to Dennis Muilenburg, Boeing's chairman, and Fabrice Brégier, chief executive of Airbus' plane manufacturing unit. The 42 signers included former Secretary of State George Shultz, former CIA director Michael Hayden and former US Senator Joseph Lieberman. HEATED POLITICS Aviation industry experts said Treasury likely would not approve the sales until after the November 8 US presidential election, although the companies would like to move more quickly. The campaign season "is not the time to push it," said Adam Pilarski, a senior vice president at the Avitas aviation consultancy in Virginia. "Once we have a resolution of who the president is, calmer heads will prevail. It is business that is good for the US" Democratic Party candidate Hillary Clinton, a former secretary of state under Obama, supports the nuclear deal. Republican candidate Donald Trump opposes it. Treasury said it would not address its engagement with specific companies. Airbus spokesman Stefan Schaffrath declined comment on the lobbying campaign, saying the company was working with US authorities to ensure that all its activities complied with applicable laws and regulations. John Dern, a Boeing spokesman, said the company is continuing to talk with approved Iranian airlines, that all its actions to date have been licensed by the US government and that any final agreements also would need approval. Since it is based in Chicago, Boeing must obtain a license from Treasury before the sale can go through. France-based Airbus must also obtain a license, as would virtually any aircraft maker, because its planes contain more than 10 percent US content. Supporters of the Boeing sale say American firms will lose out to foreign competitors if the US government bars sales to Iran. Although the nuclear pact eased sanctions connected to Iran's nuclear program, restrictions related to concerns such as terrorism support and human rights abuses remain. - Reuters Tags: airbus | Iran | US | Boeing | Nuclear | pact | More Travel, Tourism & Hospitality Stories Dubai Parks and Resorts unveils UAE National Day offers Dubai Outlet Mall to host art festival Air Arabia confirms options for five Airbus A320s Motiongate Dubai unveils sneak peak trailer of Step Up Dubai Bab Al Qasr Hotel unveils special F1 offers Kuwait Airways launches direct flights to four destinations Supercasa awards RAK hotel consultancy contract ME hotel revenues down in October, Africa results mixed Lufthansa cancels 900 flights as pilots go on two-day strike InterCon to restart work on 350-room UAE resort Jumeirah Al Naseem to open in December New digital membership card for Qatar Airways' Privilege Club members Sofitel Abu Dhabi Corniche welcomes new chef de cuisine Turkish Airlines adds new on-board entertainment option Labranda Hotels expands its portfolio in Turkey US approves Airbus sale of over 100 jets to Iran Lufthansa cancels 876 flights on Nov 23 Iata appoints new regional VP for Middle East, Africa Wyndham Hotel Group welcomes new MEA regional VP Abu Dhabi Airport welcomes over 20m passengers till Oct RJ honours best-selling travel agents for 2016 Earn Gulf Air Falconflyer miles with Al Salam Bank visa credit cards Slovenia sees rise in ME tourist numbers Dubai Culture, ArtintheCity launch 24th edition of ArtMap Etihad Aviation Group showcases future of air travel Abu Dhabi food festival to serve culinary extravaganza Wataniya Airways inks key deal to boost passenger service system Gulfstream to showcase business jets at MEBAA 2016 RAK to launch adventure tours Turkish Airlines wins new award in advertising Calendar of Events View all events Tools Exchange Rates Weather Forecast BBC World Service Ads Sectors | Information | About Us | Construction & Real Estate Energy, Oil & Gas Finance & Capital Market Industry & Logistics IT & Telecommunication Health & Environment Motoring Retail & Wholesale Travel, Tourism & Hospitality Government & Laws Media & Promotion Back to top Trade News Newsletter Events Business Directory TradeArabia Network Advertising Contact Feedback Privacy Statement Terms of Service Web Feeds

Boeing and CIM Tools executives signed the contract during a ceremony in the city. Under the contract, CIM Tools will supply over 57,000 complex titanium machined parts, aluminium details and assemblies for Boeing 787 and 737 airplanes in the coming years.

CIM Tools is one of the micro small and medium enterprises (MSME) in India, which Boeing is directly working with. This is in line with Boeing’s strategy in India to develop an indigenous aerospace and defence ecosystem to further support the ‘Make in India’ initiative. “This is yet another step in fulfilling our commitment in the creation of a globally competitive aerospace supply chain in India that delivers to stringent global standards,” said Pratyush Kumar, president, Boeing India. “We look forward to the success of the new contract that we are signing with CIM Tools. Our partnerships with Indian suppliers play an important part in Boeing’s strategy of establishing itself as a global industrial champion,” said Ashwani Bhargava, director, Supplier Management, Boeing India. “Our agreement with CIM Tools is another demonstration of our commitment to developing the aerospace industry in India,” he added. "We never expected to become a direct supplier to Boeing in this short span and are ecstatic with the selection of Boeing,” said Srikanth, one of the founders and director for business development and finance, at CIM Tools Private Ltd.

Share story By Dominic Gates Seattle Times aerospace reporter In Friday’s Seafair aerial display over Lake Washington, online retail giant Amazon will fly its latest Boeing 767 widebody jet freighter, publicly revealing the new “Prime Air” branded livery of its fast-growing fleet of used cargo planes. The company unveiled the plane Thursday at a media briefing closely coordinated with Boeing. According to two sources with knowledge of the discussions, Amazon is talking to Boeing about the possibility of later buying new 767s for its air-cargo fleet. Dave Clark, Amazon.com’s senior vice president of worldwide operations, insisted in an interview that “at this moment, that’s not something we’re pursuing,” though he added: “I’d never say never, … Who knows what the future holds?” Amazon already is operating a fleet of 10 Boeing 767 freighters, flying daily out of its air hub in Wilmington, Ohio. Within two years, it expects to have 40 similar used cargo jets connecting its package fulfillment centers across the U.S. Though the 767 flying at Seafair is the 11th to join the Amazon fleet, it’s the first to be painted in the new livery; in letters stenciled under the cockpit window, it’s designated “Amazon One.” The jet’s tail sports Amazon’s smile logo. Yet the main branding, “Prime Air” in large letters along the fuselage, emphasizes the company’s focus on high-revenue Amazon Prime customers, who pay an annual fee for two-day, no-charge shipping, unlimited streaming of movies and TV shows, and other services. Clark said Thursday the airplane fleet is needed “to meet the incredible growth we see in Prime customer demand for high-speed deliveries in the U.S.” As a further nerdy nod to that goal, Amazon changed the Federal Aviation Administration registration of the jet to N1997A. The company went public in 1997 and that number is a prime number (a mathematical term for a number divisible only by itself and 1). Company spokeswoman Kelly Cheeseman said Amazon will try to get prime-number registrations for its entire airplane fleet. Amazon’s air force is just the latest arm of its ever-expanding delivery operation. Last year, Amazon began deploying a dedicated fleet of 4,000 tractor-trailers, also branded Amazon Prime in large letters. Amazon says these new ground and air fleets are meant to supplement, not replace, the third-party carriers — FedEx and UPS among them — that have long delivered its packages. The aggressive expansion has raised suspicion that Amazon may one day turn its transportation network into another revenue stream by delivering packages for other companies, becoming a competitor to FedEx and UPS. Yet Clark said the fleet of 40 widebody jets is intended strictly for Amazon business. “Right now, everything going on those planes is inventory held in Amazon fulfillment centers and sold on the Amazon website,” he said. “And we have more than enough package supply to utilize the 40 planes we’ve procured.” Clark also said Amazon for now is focusing its air operation on the U.S. domestic market and has no plans yet to expand internationally. Could Amazon later buy new 767s from Boeing or perhaps even larger freighters such as 777s or 747s for international routes? An aviation executive involved in discussions regarding Amazon’s needs said the supply of younger used 767-300 passenger jets suitable for conversion to freighters is limited and Amazon might want to ensure certainty of its supply by buying new. That person said Boeing is discussing the sale of 20 of its 767s to Amazon.

The setting for Thursday’s unveiling of Amazon One was suggestive: Even though the plane was a used jet, not bought from Boeing, it was displayed in a Boeing hangar at Boeing Field, with many Boeing personnel present, including Bruce Dickinson, the vice president in charge of the 767 and 747 jet programs. Boeing’s hosting of the event shows the jet maker is certainly keeping close to Amazon. Yet Clark deflected all queries about possible future purchases. “Today the only thing we’re announcing is this plane and the 40 we have. We continuously evaluate and will add as needed,” Clark responded. “If that day ever comes, Boeing would be a great partner.” Also present at the media event were Joe Hete, chief executive of cargo airline and lessor ATSG, and Bill Flynn, chief executive of cargo operator Atlas Air. Wilmington, Ohio-based ATSG is leasing 20 of the 767s to Amazon and operating them for the retail giant. It’s also providing loading and unloading logistics for Amazon’s entire air fleet. ATSG deployed its 10th Amazon 767 last week. By the end of this year, it expects to have a total fleet of 60 aircraft, of which 15 would be Amazon planes, with five more to be added by next summer. Purchase, N.Y.-based Atlas Air is leasing to Amazon the remaining 20 aircraft and will operate them. The jet at Seafair is the first provided to Amazon by Atlas. Last year, Atlas hired 375 pilots and is growing dramatically. By the time its 20-jet Amazon fleet is complete, Atlas is expected to have more than 90 aircraft. Flynn said Atlas will hire 400 to 500 pilots just for its Amazon operation. As this air expansion of Amazon’s logistics takes shape, the Seafair aerial display provides a high-profile marketing debut. “We very purposely wanted to do this in Seattle … for our employees and to share with the community,” said Clark. The Amazon plane will fly over Lake Washington on Friday through Sunday from 1:15 to 1:30 p.m., just before the Blue Angels display.

Airbus envisaged a future of strong hub-to-hub flying that would require its A380. Boeing foresaw the emergence of new long haul city pairs as airlines bypassed hubs to link small/medium cities directly point-to-point with its 787. Both manufacturers were right – and wrong. Hubs dominate, yet most airlines prefer medium/large aircraft and not the very large aircraft category, consisting of A380s and 747-8s. A380 sales have lagged, raising questions about the aircraft's future, while Boeing is cutting 747-8 production again and has acknowledged that it may need to end production entirely. Boeing positioned its 787 as a “hub-buster” that would not require passengers to transfer through hubs. Yet 73% of 787 flights are between hubs, among those operated by airlines with more than hub. Hub-to-secondary flights are few, but demonstrate some of Boeing's objectives with the 787: new routes and more frequencies. While hubs dominate, the 787 has given rise to smaller hubs like Denver and Calgary. Partnerships also help explain 787 network deployment: 66% of 787 flights are on routes without a partnership, perhaps indicating airline preference for a lower-risk aircraft.

Amazon unveiled its first branded cargo plane Thursday, one of 40 freighters that will make up the company's ... own air transportation network of 40 Boeing jets leased from Atlas Air and Air Transportation Services Group, which will operate the air cargo network. (AP Photo/Ted S. Warren) Expand Amazon Reveals 'Prime Air' Cargo Jet Published August 06, 2016 Ecommerce Dow Jones Newswires Facebook Twitter Print Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) unveiled the first in a planned fleet of new cargo jets on Thursday, part of an effort by the e-commerce giant to expand its logistics operation. Continue Reading Below The Boeing (BA) 767-300, emblazoned with "Prime Air" on its fuselage, is to be operated by Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings Inc. (AAWW). It is one of 40 that Amazon has agreed to lease as it broadens its system for shipping and delivering goods quickly to supplement partners such as United Parcel Service Inc. (UPS) and FedEx Corp.(FDX). The plane is part of a deal announced in May to lease 20 Boeing planes from Atlas Air, following a similar deal in March to lease as many as 20 jets from Air Transport Services Group (ATSG). The effort stems from a broad desire at Amazon to take greater control of its shipping and package delivery operations. In some cases, the firm is using its own trucks, drivers and a fleet of couriers for so-called last mile delivery, the final and most-expensive leg of an order’s trip. Amazon’s shipping costs have been rising more quickly than sales, and having its own cargo fleet could help stem the rise. The company said last month its second-quarter shipping expenses rose 44% to $3.36 billion, while sales rose 31%. In its deal with Amazon, Atlas provides crew, maintenance and insurance over the course of seven years. Atlas said it expects to begin putting the Amazon planes into service this quarter. Continue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT Notably, the Prime Air designation has been used until now for Amazon’s nascent drone delivery program. Prime refers to Amazon’s $99-per-year unlimited two-day shipping program. Amazon was expected to put the plane on public display on Friday at the Boeing Seafair Air Show in its hometown of Seattle.   Fox Business Markets Politics Features FBN TV About Fox Business Channel Finder Advertise With Us Jobs Internships New Terms of Use (What's new) New Privacy Policy FAQ Media Relations Closed Captioning Policy Accessibility Statement Quotes delayed at least 15 minutes.

WARREN | THE ASSOCIATED PRESS Amazon.com boxes are stacked near a Boeing 767 “Prime Air” cargo plane on display in Seattle on Thursday. SEATTLE — Seattle-based Amazon is unveiling its first branded cargo plane, one of 40 jetliners that will make up the e-commerce giant's own air transportation network as it takes more control of its delivery process. The latest push to speed delivery of its products comes as the company ships an increasing number of packages worldwide. Amazon's parcel volume was an estimated 1 billion packages in 2015 — the same number that FedEx delivered three years earlier for hundreds of thousands of customers. The planes will have connections to Ohio, where Amazon has been making a major investment in distribution and technology operations. In March, following months of speculation, Amazon confirmed it had struck a deal with Wilmington-based ATSG to lease 20 Boeing freighter jets. ATSG operates at the air park that was handed over to the city of Wilmington by DHL when the German shipping giant closed its operations there. Under the initial 5-year agreement, ATSG also will operate the aircraft and provide logistics services to Amazon. In central Ohio, Amazon is building two distribution centers along with three data centers. Amazon has had issues with the reliability of air freight services. In 2013, it offered refunds to customers who got their Christmas orders late after bad weather and a jump in online shopping caused delays for UPS and FedEx. Analysts say it makes sense for Amazon to use an air fleet it controls as another way to get its products to online shoppers drawn to fast, no-extra-cost delivery. "They're such a big online retailer," said Satish Jindel, president of shipping consultant ShipMatrix. "There's so much volume that if you have to add transportation for yourself, why would you pay a retail price when you can get wholesale? It makes sense." Amazon revealed its first branded "Prime Air" cargo plane, designated Amazon One, on Friday at the annual Seafair Air Show. Amazon leased a total of 40 Boeing jets from Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings and Air Transport Services Group Inc. Eleven of the planes already are delivering packages for Amazon's annual Prime loyalty program, which offers free two-day shipping and other perks. The remaining freighters will be rolled out in the next couple of years. Aircraft like Amazon One allow the company to "continue to maintain our fast delivery speeds and lower our costs as our Prime base and our Prime member growth continue to soar," said Dave Clark, Amazon's senior vice president of worldwide operations. Despite its growing fleet of aircraft, Amazon said it plans to continue to use FedEx, UPS and other transportation partners. "Because of our growth and the sheer amount of packages, we are supplementing our transportation needs," Clark said. The company has been furiously building out distribution centers, where workers and robots pull products off shelves and package them for delivery, as well as smaller sorting plants, which arrange packages by ZIP code for faster delivery. It has a network of more than 125 fulfillment centers worldwide. Amazon recently reported a second-quarter profit of $857 million on $30 billion in revenue. The company doesn't yet have plans to carry packages for others but says it's constantly evaluating its situation. Amazon has not been shy about competing in businesses areas far-flung from its e-commerce roots. "Once you have those planes, it certainly creates the opportunity for new products for customers," Clark said, adding: "Stay tuned and we'll see what happens in the future."

Frank Kendall, the Defense Department's top weapons buyer, has convened a closed session of the Defense Acquisition Board for Wednesday to review the Air Force's acquisition strategy and updated cost estimates for replacing Minuteman III nuclear-armed missiles that have sat in silos for almost 50 years. The Air Force last year estimated the program would cost $62.3 billion for research and development and production of as many as 400 missiles as well as command and control systems and infrastructure. Lockheed Martin, Boeing and Northrop Grumman are all competing to build the new ICBMs. The other arms of the nation's land-air-sea nuclear triad also are scheduled to be modernized: Northrop defeated a Lockheed-Boeing team in October for the right to build a new bomber that can carry nuclear weapons, a project valued at as much as $80 billion. The Navy is planning to replace its Ohio-class nuclear-armed submarines through a production program now estimated at $122 billion. Updated estimates for the cost of the missiles have been prepared by the Air Force and and the Pentagon's independent cost assessment office but haven't yet been released. The Navy is also updating its submarine estimate for a review later this year. The new forecasts are likely to add to the debate over whether coming administrations will be able to afford what defense analysts call a "bow wave" of costs converging in the next decade for the new nuclear systems as well as nine Air Force conventional systems and plans for increased construction of naval vessels such as a second Ford-class aircraft carrier. The ICBM "milestone marks the official beginning of the technology development stage where contracts will be awarded and spending" will "begin to ramp up," from about $75 million this year to $1.6 billion in 2021, Todd Harrison, a defense budget analyst with the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said in an email. Arms control organizations and some Pentagon officials say the nuclear triad's modernization could cost as much as $1 trillion over 30 years if research, procurement, operations and support are included. By way of comparison, Pentagon analysts estimate that Lockheed's F-35 jet, the military's most expensive program, may cost as much as $1.12 trillion over 60 years to support. "It's also important to put these costs in context," Harrison said. "The U.S. will likely spend more than $20 trillion over the next 30 years on defense, so $1 trillion is only a small fraction of that," Harrison said. Still, the bow wave's cost is likely to force the Air Force to delay the ICBM program or cancel it in favor of modifying the existing missiles because the service has higher priorities, predicted Kingston Reif, an analyst with the Arms Control Association. The Pentagon review "reflects the current department and service commitment to the program, but it's far from a point of no return," Reif said in an email. Adm. Cecil Haney, head of the U.S. Strategic Command, told a House Armed Services Committee panel last month the new missile program is necessary because a comprehensive nuclear deterrence "requires us to have a complex problem for an adversary." "If that program is delayed it really puts the one leg of the triad at significant risk" from "a reliability standpoint," Haney said. The Air Force plans to award two 36-month contracts by September 2017 for the ICBM's technology development phase and then one contract in about 2020 for engineering, manufacturing, development and first five production lots, Leah Bryant, spokeswoman for the Air Force Nuclear Weapons Center, said in an email. The program is planning to offer competition for numerous aspects of the missile program, she added.

The company is showcasing the Boeing 767-300 this weekend at Seattle’s SeaFair Air Show. It will be flown and operated by Atlas Air Worldwide, which provides Amazon’s air cargo services. The cargo plane, which displays the Prime Air and Amazon smile logos, is one of 40 Boeing 767s that the company is leasing from Atlas and its other cargo partner, Air Transport Services Group. There are currently 11 dedicated planes flying for the company, with the remainder rolling out over the coming years. “Creating an air transportation network is expanding our capacity to ensure great delivery speeds for our Prime members for years to come,” said Dave Clark, Amazon’s senior vice president of worldwide operations, in a press release. “I cannot imagine a better way to celebrate the inaugural flight than in our hometown at Seafair alongside Amazon employees and Seattle residents.” With its fleet of planes, 4000 truck trailers, and Uber-style Flex delivery vans - along with the eventual arrival of drones and container ships - the big question is whether the logistics network Amazon is building will ultimately see it abandon partners FedEx and UPS altogether, and perhaps even start competing aginst the two giants with its own delivery service. Jeff Bezos says this isn’t Amazon's intentions, claiming the firm just needs the additional capacity, but, as it proved with AWS, if there’s an opportunity to move into a new, money-making business then Amazon won’t stand idly by.

Skip to navigation Skip to content Skip to sidebar news national More F-35s to make Canadian debut at B.C. airshow — and Super Hornets will be there too David Pugliese, Ottawa Citizen  08.05.2016 F-35 Lightning II hovers in front of crowds during its first solo appearance at the Farnborough Airshow in England on July 12, 2016. A Boeing F/A-18 Super Hornet at the Farnborough Airshow in England on July 12, 2016. ShareAdjustCommentPrint The F-35 will make its debut in Canada at an airshow in British Columbia next week as aerospace companies ramp up their campaigns to sell the federal government new fighter aircraft. The stealth aircraft is expected to arrive in Canada on Thursday, the first time the plane has come to Canada. It will be displayed at the Abbotsford International Airshow which starts Aug. 12. The visit comes as F-35 manufacturer Lockheed Martin increases its campaign to convince Canada the stealth aircraft is the plane to replace the country’s CF-18 fighter jets. Lockheed’s rival, Boeing, will also have its Super Hornet aircraft at the same airshow. Two F-35s will be at the show, Lockheed Martin officials have confirmed. In addition, two Super Hornets will also be featured, in addition to a training simulator. Five defence firms recently responded to the Liberal government’s call for information about fighter jets that could replace the CF-18s. Boeing submitted information on its Super Hornet jet, Lockheed Martin provided information on the F-35A, Dassault responded with the data on the Rafale, Eurofighter with the Typhoon, and the Saab Group offered details on the Gripen aircraft. During last year’s election campaign, Liberal leader Justin Trudeau promised Canada would not purchase the F-35, an aircraft he said was unnecessary for the country’s needs and too expensive. Liberal defence minister Harjit Sajjan, however, has said he is interested in an open competition for the CF-18 replacement. How the Liberals will now proceed on the replacement is unknown at this point. Sajjan says that the CF-18s have to be replaced as soon as possible. But asked recently about when the Liberal government will know how it is going to proceed, Sajjan said he couldn’t provide specific details. “It all depends on a lot of the information that we do collect but it is going to be months, not years definitely because of the urgency for this,” he explained to journalists. “I can’t give you a precise date but like I said it will be in the months coming.” The U.S. air force recently declared the F-35A ready for combat but aerospace analysts say much more work and testing needs to be done with the plane. The F-35 became a major political headache several years ago for the Conservative government. Although a Liberal government originally signed on to a research and development program for the plane, the Conservatives significantly expanded commitment and later agreed to the purchase of 65 of the planes. At the time, then-defence-minister Peter MacKay sat in a wooden model of a F-35 during a press conference that cost taxpayers $47,000. But the F-35 program was dogged by controversy and the aircraft faced numerous technical problems. The Department of National Defence originally claimed the project would cost around $14.7 billion, but then-parliamentary budget officer Kevin Page put the price tag for 65 aircraft at around $29 billion. Auditor general Michael Ferguson also issued a report that concluded DND officials withheld key information from Parliament about the fighter-jet purchase, underestimated costs and didn’t follow proper procurement rules. An independent audit on Canada’s proposed F-35 project found the purchase of the aircraft would cost $44 billion over the 42-year life of the plane. That figure included everything from maintenance to fuel. In addition, some U.S. lawmakers have raised concerns the aircraft is too expensive and won’t be able to fulfill its military’s requirements.

Homes Heritage Perth and District Christmas House Tour Our Ottawa Around Town: Liberal MPs put "a sock on it" at ... 5 / 5 F-35 to make debut in Canada next week, Super Hornets to be at same airshow David Pugliese, Ottawa Citizen More from David Pugliese, Ottawa Citizen Published on: August 5, 2016 | Last Updated: August 5, 2016 4:32 PM EST The F-35 will make its debut in Canada next week. Rick Bowmer / AP Share Adjust Comment Print The F-35 will make its debut in Canada at an airshow in British Columbia next week as aerospace companies ramp up their campaigns to sell the federal government new fighter aircraft. The stealth aircraft is expected to arrive in Canada on Thursday, the first time the plane has come to Canada. It will be displayed at the Abbotsford International Airshow which starts Aug. 12. The visit comes as F-35 manufacturer Lockheed Martin increases its campaign to convince Canada the stealth aircraft is the plane to replace the country’s CF-18 fighter jets. Lockheed’s rival, Boeing, will also have its Super Hornet aircraft at the same airshow. Two F-35s will be at the show, Lockheed Martin officials have confirmed. In addition, two Super Hornets will also be featured, in addition to a training simulator. Five defence firms recently responded to the Liberal government’s call for information about fighter jets that could replace the CF-18s. Boeing submitted information on its Super Hornet jet, Lockheed Martin provided information on the F-35A, Dassault responded with the data on the Rafale, Eurofighter with the Typhoon, and the Saab Group offered details on the Gripen aircraft. During last year’s election campaign, Liberal leader Justin Trudeau promised Canada would not purchase the F-35, an aircraft he said was unnecessary for the country’s needs and too expensive. Liberal defence minister Harjit Sajjan, however, has said he is interested in an open competition for the CF-18 replacement. How the Liberals will now proceed on the replacement is unknown at this point. Sajjan says that the CF-18s have to be replaced as soon as possible. But asked recently about when the Liberal government will know how it is going to proceed, Sajjan said he couldn’t provide specific details. “It all depends on a lot of the information that we do collect but it is going to be months, not years definitely because of the urgency for this,” he explained to journalists.  “I can’t give you a precise date but like I said it will be in the months coming.” The U.S. air force recently declared the F-35A ready for combat but aerospace analysts say much more work and testing needs to be done with the plane. The F-35 became a major political headache several years ago for the Conservative government. Although a Liberal government originally signed on to a research and development program for the plane, the Conservatives significantly expanded commitment and later agreed to the purchase 65 of the planes. At the time then Defence Minister Peter MacKay sat is a wooden model of a F-35 during a press conference that cost taxpayers $47,000. But the F-35 program was dogged by controversy and the aircraft faced numerous technical problems. The Department of National Defence originally claimed the project would cost around $14.7 billion, but then-parliamentary budget officer Kevin Page put the price tag for 65 aircraft at around $29 billion. Auditor general Michael Ferguson also issued a report that concluded DND officials withheld key information from Parliament about the fighter-jet purchase, underestimated costs and didn’t follow proper procurement rules. An independent audit on Canada’s proposed F-35 project found the purchase of the aircraft would cost $44 billion over the 42-year life of the plane. That figure included everything from maintenance to fuel. In addition, some U.S. lawmakers have raised concerns the aircraft is too expensive and won’t be able to fulfill its military’s requirements.   Photos: Romanian special forces, Canadian naval commandos in action Senior Canadian military officer accused of sex crimes involving a cadet...

自由電子報 | 影音娛樂 | 好康報報 | 自由部落 ‧Business Home Front Page Taiwan News Business Editorials Sports World News Features Bilingual Pages Home / Business Sat, Aug 06, 2016 - Page 10　News List Print Mail Facebook Twitter plurk funp Amazon unveils first airplane for delivery network AP, SEATTLE Amazon.com Inc Prime Air’s Amazon One, a Boeing Co 767 cargo airplane, is parked inside a Boeing hangar for a media event in Seattle on Thursday. Photo: AP Seattle-based Amazon.com Inc unveiled its first branded cargo airplane, one of 40 jetliners that are to make up the e-commerce giant’s own air transportation network as it takes more control of its delivery process. The latest push to speed delivery of its products comes as the company ships an increasing number of packages worldwide. Amazon’s parcel volume was an estimated 1 billion packages last year — the same number that FedEx delivered three years earlier for hundreds of thousands of customers. Analysts said it makes sense for Amazon to use an air fleet it controls as another way to get its products to online shoppers drawn to fast, no-extra-cost delivery. “They’re such a big online retailer,” said Satish Jindel, president of shipping consultant ShipMatrix. “There’s so much volume that if you have to add transportation for yourself, why would you pay a retail price when you can get wholesale? It makes sense.” The company’s first branded Prime Air cargo airplane, designated Amazon One, was scheduled to buzz over Seattle’s Lake Washington yesterday afternoon, just before the US Navy’s Blue Angels were to take to the skies, a company official said. Amazon leased 40 Boeing Co jets from Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings and Air Transport Services Group Inc, which is to operate the air cargo network. Eleven of the airplanes are already delivering packages for Amazon’s annual Prime loyalty program, which offers free two-day shipping and other perks. The remaining freighters are to be rolled out over the next couple of years. Despite its growing fleet of aircraft, Amazon said it plans to continue to use FedEx, UPS and other transportation partners. “Because of our growth and the sheer amount of packages, we are supplementing our transportation needs,” Amazon senior vice president of worldwide operations Dave Clark said. The company has been furiously building out distribution centers, where workers and robots pull products off shelves and package them for delivery, as well as smaller sorting plants, which arrange packages by ZIP code for faster delivery. It has a network of more than 125 fulfillment centers worldwide. The company does not yet have plans to carry packages for others, but said it is constantly evaluating its situation. Amazon has not been shy about competing in businesses areas far-flung from its e-commerce roots. “Once you have those planes, it certainly creates the opportunity for new products for customers,” Clark said: “Stay tuned and we’ll see what happens in the future.” This story has been viewed 1685 times.

By Harmeet Singh August 5, 2016 For Troy Graham, ECD at Vancouver’s Thinkingbox, virtual reality is all about providing presence that couldn’t necessarily be experienced elsewhere. That could be a rollercoaster ride when you’re nowhere near an amusement park or bringing the average person into a desolate camp to experience some of what real refugees are seeing. With so much pick-up of VR in the entertainment and ad industries, it’s still a special medium and deserves to be used for the right reasons, to provide an experience people otherwise may not get, Graham says. In the case of the studio’s recent project with United Airlines, that meant bringing consumers onto a plane that’s not yet built. The American airline was set to introduce its new high-end Polaris Business Class, its biggest product innovation in more than a decade. The official launch, though, isn’t until December, when the Boeing planes equipped with the newly-designed cabins will be ready for flight. Still, the timing of the launch to build anticipation was important, says Daniel Cuellar, senior manager, onboard product development at United. It needed to be ahead of the fall – overtaken by U.S. election news – and the winter holiday season. The brand did have the new seat design and other features of its lounge and plane cabin available in a ballroom setting, but it wanted to show off the new design in a more immersive way, prompting it to turn to Thinkingbox to bring the concept to life more fully with an experience using Oculus Rift headsets. The biggest challenge came down to data, Cuellar says. During the months-long process, United turned to Boeing and design firm PriestmanGoode for complete specifics around the aircraft’s design, from engineering drawings to fabrics, to make the VR experience accurate to the real-life one. To help the process along, Thinkingbox set Cuellar up with his own headset in his Chicago office to test its concepts from Vancouver in real-time, he notes. The finished experience – including narration by actor Matt Damon – used 3D assets built to spec from Boeing’s renders and characters made by filming real United employees and compositing that into the environment, along with additional animated characters using motion-capture technology. The VR experience debuted in June in New York City at an event targeted to United’s top business class customers and is now travelling to various travel conventions and trade shows. A 360-degree virtual tour video is also being shared on social media, while the airline is working on getting Google Cardboards into the hands of its salesforce to make the VR experience more accessible. Apart from immersing customers into Polaris, the experience has also been a unique training tool for United’s 26,000 flight attendants to understand the new setting, Cuellar adds.

Ted S. Warren/AP View Caption About video ads View Caption of Amazon unveiled its first branded cargo plane Thursday, one of 40 jetliners that will make up Amazon's own air transportation network of 40 Boeing jets leased from Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings and Air Transport Services Group Inc., which will operate the air cargo network.  Amazon’s first branded cargo plane, Prime One, will take to the skies over Seattle’s Lake Washington for its inaugural flight Friday afternoon, as Amazon seeks to assume greater control over the shipping process. The online shopping site was responsible for shipping 1 billion packages last year, and after reliability issues with outside carriers such as FedEx and UPS, the company made the decision to maintain its own fleet of cargo planes. Recommended: Are you a savvy global traveler? Take the quiz "Because of our growth and the sheer amount of packages," Amazon's senior vice president of worldwide operations Dave Clark said, according to the Associated Press, "we are supplementing our transportation needs." Test your knowledge Are you a savvy global traveler? Take the quiz Photos of the Day Photos of the day 11/22 Prime One’s flight on Friday has been a long time in the making. The company had signed a deal in March to lease 20 Boeing 767 cargo planes from the Air Transport Services Group (ATSG), The Christian Science Monitor reported. "Since last summer, we have been working closely with Amazon to demonstrate that a dedicated, fully customized air cargo network can be a strong supplement to existing transportation and distribution resources," Joe Hete, the president and chief executive officer of ATSG, said in a statement at the time of the deal. "We are excited to serve Amazon customers by providing additional air cargo capacity and logistics support to ensure great shipping speeds." The leases will last between five and seven years. Amazon hopes that by streamlining the delivery system, it will be able to deliver more packages more quickly and cheaply than ever before. "They're such a big online retailer," said Satish Jindel, the president of shipping consultant ShipMatrix. "There's so much volume that if you have to add transportation for yourself, why would you pay a retail price when you can get wholesale? It makes sense." Although Amazon still intends to rely in part on UPS and FedEx for some of its shipping, 11 of the 40 jetliners are already delivering packages to Amazon Prime customers across the nation. The remaining planes will be phased into service over the next several years. Given Amazon’s rapid expansion, the company is exploring a number of options to help packages get to their destinations more quickly. Amazon has built several new fulfillment centers, and is even exploring more delivery options. Amazon is also continuing to test its drone delivery: currently, the company is testing a delivery program in Britain, where drone testing regulations are less stringent than they are in the United States. Mr. Clark hinted an exciting future for the company. "Once you have those planes, it certainly creates the opportunity for new products for customers," Clark added. "Stay tuned and we'll see what happens in the future." This report includes material from the Associated Press. Next up Test your knowledge Are you a savvy global traveler?

Speculations are rising in the media that Iran’s deals with global plane makers Airbus and Boeing may not be decided on by the administration of US President Barack Obama and both deals could be approved by the Treasury Department only when a new administration is in office.   Reuters in a report has quoted aviation industry experts as saying that the Treasury is not expected to approve the deals until after the US presidential election in November.  They have emphasized that the campaign season is “not the time to push it”, adding that the due proceedings could only move ahead “once we have a resolution of who the president is”.  In January, Iran signed a major contract with European aviation giant Airbus worth about $27 billion to buy 118 planes within the next few months. The contract was signed during the visit to Paris by Iran’s President Hassan Rouhani. Iran also sealed a deal in June worth around $25 billion with the US aerospace heavyweight, Boeing, for the purchase of 100 passenger planes.    The deal with Boeing is still facing a possible ban by Congress in what many see as a result of the growing anti-Iran measures adopted by US lawmakers. Reuters has quoted Airbus spokesman Stefan Schaffrath as saying that the company was working with US authorities to ensure that all its activities complied with applicable laws and regulations. It has also quoted John Dern, a Boeing spokesman, as saying that the company is continuing to talk with approved Iranian airlines, that all its actions to date have been licensed by the US government and that any final agreements also would need approval.   Loading ...

The Amazon.com logo is on e-readers, tablet computers and countless cardboard boxes on doorsteps. Now, the familiar, swooping arrow is about to show up somewhere new: plastered on the side of a Boeing 767. The e-commerce giant on Friday is set to show off the aircraft it has dubbed "Amazon One," a plane that is among a fleet of 40 leased from two air-freight companies in an effort to improve a supply chain straining to keep pace with the retailer's growing sales and its swelling ranks of Prime members. "Creating an air transportation network is expanding our capacity to ensure great delivery speeds for our Prime members for years to come," Dave Clark, Amazon's senior vice president of worldwide operations, said in a statement. The move to create its own fleet of planes is part of a broader blitz of investment by Amazon to shore up its delivery capabilities. It has begun experimenting with an Uber-like network of drivers that could deliver packages within local markets such as Baltimore, Miami and Milwaukee. Last year, the company unveiled an Amazon-branded fleet of 4,000 trucking trailers to shuttle its wares. (Jeffrey P. Bezos, chief executive of Amazon, owns The Washington Post.) Amazon says its planes and trucking trailers are largely meant to help move goods from one warehouse to another, rather than to facilitate delivery of orders to customers. And, in that way, the company says its forays into the logistics arena are intended to complement the business it does with UPS and FedEx, not replace them. Yet some analysts wonder if the buildup of planes, trucking power and drivers should be interpreted as something of a warning shot that Amazon has more ambitious plans to take greater control of the delivery process. Amazon is a major customer of UPS and FedEx, and the shipping firms have shrugged off the idea that the e-commerce giant intends to bypass them. Even if it did, FedEx, for example, has said that no single customer accounts for more than 3 percent of its revenue. Whatever Amazon's long game is on logistics, it is clear that it is looking to make a splash with the inaugural flight of Amazon One. The company is flying the aircraft on Friday in the Boeing Seafair Air Show, an annual event near its headquarters in Seattle. The side of the plane is emblazoned with the words "Prime Air," and its underside features the Amazon logo. The curved Amazon arrow appears on the tail. The plane's tail number - N1997A - is a prime number, a gimmick the company says is meant as a nod to its Prime customers. Eleven of its leased planes have been in the air ferrying goods, but this plane is the first to be splashed with Amazon branding. The rest of the fleet will be getting the logo treatment soon. Even as Amazon ventures into new territory with its trucking and air fleets, it continues to make other, more familiar investments in its logistics capabilities. The retailer has famously been plowing millions of dollars into building a network of fulfillment and sorting centers that enable its promise of two-day shipping on Prime orders. In this quarter alone, the company is set to open 18 fulfillment centers, or three times the number it opened in the same quarter in 2015. The retailer hopes the efforts will make it better prepared for the coming holiday season crush. Last year, fulfillment costs soared in that quarter as demand increased at its warehouses. © 2016 The Washington Post  (This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)

The airline and investigators have not confirmed the findings, and aviation experts caution that much remains unknown about the cause of the crash. But the data, if confirmed by the plane’s black boxes, indicate the crew of Flight No. EK521 was starting to go around for a second landing attempt when something went horribly wrong. Transponder data from the Boeing 777-300 obtained by aviation website FlightRadar24.com show the descending plane came close to the ground at 12:37 p.m. local time before altitude readings and the vertical speed suddenly increased, indicating the start of a go-around. RELATED: Emirates airliner with 300 onboard crash lands in Dubai That came around the same time an air traffic control radio recording has someone calling out the flight’s number and saying “returning to 4,000.” “I think it indicates that there was some kind of effort to try to gain altitude,” Mikael Robertsson, a co-founder of FlightRadar24, told The Associated Press. But within 12 seconds, the aircraft descended and struck the ground, apparently bouncing back up briefly before coming down and stopping, according to the data. At the time of the crash landing, the scorching mid-day sun had raised temperatures at the airport to a humid 49 degrees Celsius (120 degrees Fahrenheit). Barefoot passengers fleeing the plane said they burned their feet on the scalding tarmac. RELATED: Delays, cancellations at Dubai airport after crash-landing While that’s not an unusual temperature for this time of year, the hotter the conditions are, the harder it can be for engines to lift airplanes off the ground, according to experts. Winds of 39 kilometers an hour (24 mph) blew toward the northwest at the airfield at the time of the crash-landing, according to the United Arab Emirates’ National Center for Meteorology and Seismology. The possibility of wind shear — a sudden change in wind speed or direction — is also being looked into by investigators, Emirates CEO and chairman Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum has said. An attempted go-around could explain why the grounded plane’s landing gear did not appear to be extended. “If the airplane had gone around, part of the maneuver is retracting the landing gear,” said commercial airline pilot and author Patrick Smith. “It’s conceivable that during the go-around that they experienced a dangerous wind shear,” he said. John Gadzinski, an airline captain and aviation safety consultant, agreed that the transponder data was consistent with an attempted go-around by the crew. He cautioned however that the readings are not as precise as those on the airplane’s own flight data recorder, and that investigators will need more information to determine what went wrong. Emirates officials have repeatedly declined to say definitively whether the plane was attempting to go around and whether the landing gear was properly deployed. The UAE’s General Civil Aviation Authority, which is leading the investigation, said Thursday it was still working to recover the flight data and cockpit voice recorders. American and British investigators will participate in the probe because the Boeing plane was built in the U.S. and was powered by British-made Rolls-Royce Trent 800 engines. Chicago-based Boeing said it is prepared to deploy a technical team to assist with the investigation in coordination with the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board. It referred queries on the investigation to the GCAA, which plans to issue a preliminary report on the crash within a month. The crash continued to snarl travel plans well into Thursday. Dubai International Airport, the world’s busiest in terms of international traffic, said it was running “under restricted capacity and has since continued to operate with one runway.” Some flights were being redirected to the city-state’s second airport, Al Maktoum International Airport at Dubai World Central. By Thursday night, investigators had removed the charred carcass of the plane from the runway and reopened the affected runway, Dubai Airports CEO Paul Griffiths said. The crash-landing did little damage to the runway itself as the plane came to rest and burned off to the side of it, he said. Flight EK521 was carrying 282 passengers and 18 crew members on its return from Thiruvananthapuram, India. Emirates said 157 passengers stayed in Dubai following the accident, while the rest remained in transit at the airport. Five who suffered minor injuries were taken to local hospitals, the airline said. A cabin crew member was hospitalized and was expected to be released Thursday. “They were very fortunate to get everybody out. That’s a very positive thing to the cabin crew and to the design of the airplane,” Gadzinski said. A firefighter, Jassim al-Balooshi, was killed in an explosion while battling the blaze. He was buried Thursday in the emirate of Ras al-Khaimah. The GCAA meanwhile issued a warning on Twitter for people to stop “publishing videos, news or pictures of aviation’s accidents.” “Sharing such practices is considered to be irresponsible and disrespectful to the victims, and is punishable under (hashtag)UAE law,” the authority said. The UAE, while liberal compared to many Mideast nations, has stiff penalties for those convicted of publishing photos of someone without their consent or offending them. That call may be a little late, considering the worldwide attention on the accident. It came as an online video apparently made immediately after the crash circulated showing the chaos inside the plane. In the footage, some passengers frantically reach for dangling oxygen masks even though the plane has come to a stop. Over the loud speaker, a man’s voice calmly calls out: “Cabin crew, this is the captain: evacuate, evacuate.” Light gray smoke fills the cabin as some grabbed personal belongings in the overhead bins. “Please don’t do that! Leave everything!” another man shouts, presumably a member of the flight crew. “Leave the bag! Jump and slide!” Another crew member runs past empty rows of seats, likely checking for anyone left behind. The camera shakes as a woman’s voice screams for passengers to jump down an inflatable emergency slide. Finally, bright light fills the video as the person filming comes outside the plane, pausing only for a moment to look at a burning jet engine on the damaged plane’s wing before fleeing to safety.

(Photo: Twitter) Amazon leased 40 Boeing jets from Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings and Air Transport Services Group Inc., which will operate air cargo network. Seattle: Seattle-based Amazon is unveiling its first branded cargo plane, one of 40 jetliners that will make up the e-commerce giant's own air transportation network as it takes more control of its delivery process. The latest push to speed delivery of its products comes as the company ships an increasing number of packages worldwide. Amazon's parcel volume was an estimated 1 billion packages in 2015 - the same number that FedEx delivered three years earlier for hundreds of thousands of customers. Amazon has had issues with the reliability of air freight services. In 2013, it offered refunds to customers who got their Christmas orders late after bad weather and a jump in online shopping caused delays for UPS and FedEx. Analysts say it makes sense for Amazon to use an air fleet it controls as another way to get its products to online shoppers drawn to fast, no-extra-cost delivery. "They're such a big online retailer," said Satish Jindel, president of shipping consultant ShipMatrix. "There's so much volume that if you have to add transportation for yourself, why would you pay a retail price when you can get wholesale It makes sense." Amazon will reveal its branded cargo plane, Amazon One, on Friday at the annual Seafair Air Show. The plane will buzz over Seattle's Lake Washington just before the Navy's Blue Angels take to the skies, a company official said. Amazon leased 40 Boeing jets from Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings and Air Transport Services Group Inc., which will operate the air cargo network. Eleven of the planes already are delivering packages for Amazon's annual Prime loyalty program, which offers free two-day shipping and other perks. The remaining freighters will be rolled out in the next couple of years. #AmazonOne, the 1st branded plane to take flight for fast, free shipping to Prime Members https://t.co/odvy4fwqXRhttps://t.co/5nyoPD9QYM— Amazon (@amazon) August 5, 2016 Aircraft like Amazon One allow the company to "continue to maintain our fast delivery speeds and lower our costs as our Prime base and our Prime member growth continue to soar," said Dave Clark, Amazon's senior vice president of worldwide operations. Despite its growing fleet of aircraft, Amazon said it plans to continue to use FedEx, UPS and other transportation partners. "Because of our growth and the sheer amount of packages, we are supplementing our transportation needs," Clark said. The company has been furiously building out distribution centers, where workers and robots pull products off shelves and package them for delivery, as well as smaller sorting plants, which arrange packages by ZIP code for faster delivery. It has a network of more than 125 fulfillment centers worldwide. Amazon recently reported a second-quarter profit of $857 million on $30 billion in revenue. The company doesn't yet have plans to carry packages for others but says it's constantly evaluating its situation. Amazon has not been shy about competing in businesses areas far-flung from its e-commerce roots. "Once you have those planes, it certainly creates the opportunity for new products for customers," Clark said, adding: "Stay tuned and we'll see what happens in the future."

The carrier, set to receive its first 787 next year, will carry on deferring deliveries of its remaining eight A380s ordered from Airbus Group SE, Chief Executive Officer Alan Joyce said Friday at the CAPA aviation conference in Brisbane. Alan Joyce, chief executive officer of Qantas. Photographer: Patrick Hamilton/Bloomberg The range and fuel economy of the 787, also known as the Dreamliner, presents options for direct destinations that were formerly out of reach for Qantas. On Australia’s eastern seaboard, other possible routes for the aircraft include Brisbane to the U.S., Melbourne to Dallas or Sydney to Chicago, Joyce said.  “There are plenty of different options,” he said. Installing the right infrastructure for 787 passengers in Australia is key, Joyce said. The carrier is in talks with airport officials in state capitals about what’s required to support new Dreamliner routes. Longest Flight The London-Perth connection would rival the current longest flight in the world -- Emirates’ Dubai-to-Auckland link, which is scheduled to switch to using the A380 from Oct. 30. Qantas shares were unchanged at A$3.14 as of 11:56 a.m. in Sydney trading. The stock has fallen 23 percent in 2016, after gains in the past two years. Analysts expect Qantas to post record full-year net income of A$1.13 billion ($864 million), based on the average of six estimates compiled by Bloomberg, when it reports earnings on Aug. 24. The company returned to profit last year after a record loss in 2014. Qantas made two capital returns totaling more than A$1 billion combined in the past year as its balance sheet improved. Joyce said additional payouts will be considered. “Every period we will look at the ways of doing it that are efficient to the shareholders and meet their requirements,” he said. “And we’ll be looking at that again in August at the board meeting.” Qantas had A$2.3 billion in cash and equivalents on its balance sheet at the end of 2015, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Asked at the conference how long he planned to stay on as Qantas CEO, Joyce said he was “very happy” to remain and continue the airline’s turnaround. Qantas has cut thousands of jobs and deferred planes as part of a three-year transformation program. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

(AP) — Amazon develó el viernes el primer avión de carga que llevará su marca, una de las 40 aeronaves que se sumarán a la flota propia de reparto del gigante minorista, que está aumentando su control sobre la red de entregas de sus productos.   La nueva iniciativa para agilizar los repartos llegó mientras la empresa, con sede en Seattle, eleva el número de paquetes que la compañía entrega en todo el mundo. Se estima que Amazon movió unos 1.000 millones de paquetes en 2015, el mismo número que entregó FedEx tres años antes para cientos de miles de clientes.   MÁS: Amazon regresa al negocio de los teléfonos celulares pero con una diferencia   Amazon ha tenido problemas con la fiabilidad de los servicios aéreos de mercancías. En 2013 ofreció devoluciones a los clientes que recibieron tarde sus pedidos de navidad debido al mal tiempo y a un aumento en la venta a través de internet, que causó retrasos de UPS y FedEx.   Los analistas informaron que tiene sentido para Amazon emplear la flota que controla como otra forma de llevar sus productos a compradores en internet atraídos por su reparto rápido y sin coste adicional.   "Son un minorista de internet muy grande", comentó Satish Jindel, presidente de la consultora de logística ShipMatrix. "Hay tanto volumen, que si uno tiene que añadir el transporte para sí mismo, ¿por qué iba a pagar el precio de venta cuando puede hacerlo al por mayor? Tiene sentido".   La compañía presentará el viernes el primer avión con su marca, Amazon One, en la feria anual Seafair. El avión pasará sobre el lago Washington de Seattle, según un portavoz de la empresa.   MÁS: Google responde a Amazon y Oculus con nuevos productos   Amazon ha arrendado 40 aviones Boeing de Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings y Air Transport Services Group Inc., que entregarán paquetes para el programa de fidelidad Prime.   Pese a la flota que está construyendo, Amazon dijo que tiene previsto seguir trabajando con FedEx, UPS y otros socios.   Amazon informó hace poco de unos beneficios de 857 millones de dólares en el segundo trimestre del año, con unos ingresos 30.000 millones de dólares.   Seattle-based Amazon is unveiling its first branded cargo plane, one of 40 jetliners that will make up the e-commerce giant's own air transportation network as it takes more control of its delivery process.   MÁS: Amazon lanza una plataforma para compartir videos para hacerle guerra a YouTube   The latest push to speed delivery of its products comes as the company ships an increasing number of packages worldwide.

Courtesy: Boeing Emirates to fly Boeing 777 on new daily route to Myanmar Rosemary Behan Follow @behanthere August 6, 2016 Updated: August 7, 2016 12:40 PM Related Executive travel: Night shift with Emirates to Yangon Boeing 777X set to become world’s first flying iPad Boeing freezes jet prices for first time in seven years as sales slow Emirates increases daily flights from Dubai to Doha to nine Third A380 to Manchester sees Emirates ‘aving it large Topics: Emirates Airline Emirates has launched a daily direct flight to Yangon, bringing Myanmar, a relatively undiscovered destination in South East Asia, to within a six-hour flight from Dubai. The route, served by a Boeing 777-300ER, is the airline’s 155th across 82 countries and territories, and represents its fifth new destination to east Asia this year. In March, Emirates started a circular service from Dubai to Cebu and Clark in the Philippines, and Yinchuan and Zhengzhou in mainland China were added in May. The Yangon service continues on to Hanoi in Vietnam after a 90-minute stop in Myanmar’s biggest city and commercial centre. Those not disembarking in Yangon can carry on to Vietnam’s capital; the airline already operates a direct daily service to Ho Chi Minh City. Previously, most travellers to Myanmar have flown via Bangkok. Badr Abbas, the senior vice president for Far East commercial operations at Emirates, said both Yangon and Hanoi were "on a list of must-see places, especially for UAE nationals". Following a strong increase in tourist arrivals in Myanmar over the past year from around the world, Emirates’ strategy is both to capture and create demand, locally and globally. "We felt it was important to enter at this time. Emirates wants to play a major role in the growth and success of Myanmar," Mr Abbas said. Myanmar’s military government only recently opened up the country to tourism, and although some western sanctions are still in place, a boycott of tourism to the country ended in about 2010 when Aung San Suu Kyi, the leader of the National League for Democracy, was released from house arrest. Mr Abbas said Dubai tourist arrivals from the Far East were increasing, even with the current strength of the dollar, and that Myanmar is a "dynamic emerging market". The country has a population of 55 million, with 7 million living in the former capital Yangon. In terms of tourism, Myanmar’s appeal includes ancient temple sites, modern and traditional restaurants, ecotourism and a long stretch of unspoilt, remote islands and beaches on the Andaman Sea south of Yangon. In the north, new areas previously restricted to tourism are opening up. While there is currently no Myanmar embassy in the UAE, most visitors, whether travelling on business or holi­day, can apply online for an e-visa. Flights to Yangon and Hanoi depart daily from Dubai at 03.30, arriving at Yangon International Airport at 11.40 and Hanoi’s Noi Ba International Airport at 15.30. rbehan@thenational.ae Follow The National’s Business section on Twitter​​ Pages: Add your comment View all comments Related Executive travel: Night shift with Emirates to Yangon Boeing 777X set to become world’s first flying iPad Boeing freezes jet prices for first time in seven years as sales slow Emirates increases daily flights from Dubai to Doha to nine More Aviation Fiji Airways to add to fleet with five new Boeing jets Libyan airline plans to double fleet with Airbus jetliners Is it a bird?

By Fiona Keating August 6, 2016 16:07 BST Close Embed Feed EgyptAir MS804 crash: French president Francois Hollande says plane crashed IBTimes UK <iframe src="http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/videos/embed/18361" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe> Air Algerie flight AH1020 has returned to Algiers due to technical problems and landed safely, according to local media reports. A source from Air Algerie told RIA Novosti that the aircraft returned to Algeria due to a technical glitch. Flight radar shows the plane turning back on itself and cruising over the Mediterranean towards Mahon. Sources at Ennahar TV said the aircraft had already landed in Algiers due to technical damage. The passenger aeroplane flying from Algiers to Marseille had declared a mid-air emergency and then disappeared off air traffic control radar, according to reports. The Boeing 737 took off on Saturday 6 August from Algiers in the afternoon, heading to Marseille when the plane made an emergency call soon after take-off. "Flight AH1020 is currently not tracked by Flightradar24. It's either out of coverage or has already landed," reports Flightradar24, an internet tracking website that shows real-time aircraft flight information. Flight radar showed the aircraft turn around and head back towards the point where it took-off. However, before arriving, the plane disappeared from radar, according to the Mirror. The last recorded altitude of the plane was some 7,000m, according to Flightradar 24. The plane's status was listed as "unknown" by the plane tracking website, before tweeting: "We believe Air Algérie AH1020 to be a *coverage issue* NOT a missing aircraft. Our ADS-B coverage in Algeria is limited." Flightradar 24 records show the missing Boeing 737-6D6 was 14 years old. The plane had 123 passenger seats. The number of people on board is not known.

Warren) Amazon presenta avión de mercancías para red de reparto Amazon develó el primer avión de carga que llevará su marca, una de las 40 aeronaves que se sumarán a la flota propia de reparto del gigante minorista, que está aumentando su control sobre la red de entregas de sus productos. La nueva iniciativa para agilizar los repartos llegó mientras la empresa, con sede en Seattle, eleva el número de paquetes que la compañía entrega en todo el mundo. Se estima que Amazon movió unos 1.000 millones de paquetes en 2015, el mismo número que entregó FedEx tres años antes para cientos de miles de clientes. Amazon ha tenido problemas con la fiabilidad de los servicios aéreos de mercancías. En 2013 ofreció devoluciones a los clientes que recibieron tarde sus pedidos de navidad debido al mal tiempo y a un aumento en la venta a través de internet, que causó retrasos de UPS y FedEx. Los analistas informaron que tiene sentido para Amazon emplear la flota que controla como otra forma de llevar sus productos a compradores en internet atraídos por su reparto rápido y sin coste adicional. "Son un minorista de internet muy grande", comentó Satish Jindel, presidente de la consultora de logística ShipMatrix. "Hay tanto volumen, que si uno tiene que añadir el transporte para sí mismo, ¿por qué iba a pagar el precio de venta cuando puede hacerlo al por mayor? Tiene sentido". La compañía presentará el viernes el primer avión con su marca, Amazon One, en la feria anual Seafair. El avión pasará sobre el lago Washington de Seattle, según un portavoz de la empresa. Amazon ha arrendado 40 aviones Boeing de Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings y Air Transport Services Group Inc., que entregarán paquetes para el programa de fidelidad Prime. Pese a la flota que está construyendo, Amazon dijo que tiene previsto seguir trabajando con FedEx, UPS y otros socios. Amazon informó hace poco de unos beneficios de 857 millones de dólares en el segundo trimestre del año, con unos ingresos 30.000 millones de dólares.

Dos recién nacidos en California son diagnosticados con microencefalia, la afección relacionada al virus del Zika, revela el Departamento de Salud Pública. Según el departamento, las madres de ambos menores habían contraído el virus en sus países natales al estar embarazadas. Por  ahora las señoras... (Selene Rivera) The latest push to speed delivery of its products comes as the company ships an increasing number of packages worldwide. Amazon's parcel volume was an estimated 1 billion packages in 2015 — the same number that FedEx delivered three years earlier for hundreds of thousands of customers. Amazon has had issues with the reliability of air freight services. In 2013, it offered refunds to customers who got their Christmas orders late after bad weather and a jump in online shopping caused delays for UPS and FedEx. Analysts say it makes sense for Amazon to use an air fleet it controls as another way to get its products to online shoppers drawn to fast, no-extra-cost delivery. "They're such a big online retailer," said Satish Jindel, president of shipping consultant ShipMatrix. "There's so much volume that if you have to add transportation for yourself, why would you pay a retail price when you can get wholesale? It makes sense." Amazon will reveal its first branded "Prime Air" cargo plane, designated Amazon One, on Friday at the annual Seafair Air Show. The plane will buzz over Seattle's Lake Washington just before the Navy's Blue Angels take to the skies, a company official said. Amazon leased 40 Boeing jets from Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings and Air Transport Services Group Inc., which will operate the air cargo network. Eleven of the planes already are delivering packages for Amazon's annual Prime loyalty program, which offers free two-day shipping and other perks. The remaining freighters will be rolled out in the next couple of years. Aircraft like Amazon One allow the company to "continue to maintain our fast delivery speeds and lower our costs as our Prime base and our Prime member growth continue to soar," said Dave Clark, Amazon's senior vice president of worldwide operations. Despite its growing fleet of aircraft, Amazon said it plans to continue to use FedEx, UPS and other transportation partners. "Because of our growth and the sheer amount of packages, we are supplementing our transportation needs," Clark said. The company has been furiously building out distribution centers, where workers and robots pull products off shelves and package them for delivery, as well as smaller sorting plants, which arrange packages by ZIP code for faster delivery. It has a network of more than 125 fulfillment centers worldwide. Amazon recently reported a second-quarter profit of $857 million on $30 billion in revenue. The company doesn't yet have plans to carry packages for others but says it's constantly evaluating its situation. Amazon has not been shy about competing in businesses areas far-flung from its e-commerce roots. "Once you have those planes, it certainly creates the opportunity for new products for customers," Clark said, adding: "Stay tuned and we'll see what happens in the future."

(Photo: Amazon) SAN FRANCISCO - Amazon has been cagey about the buildout of a proprietary air network to extend the company's delivery capacity — but no more. On Friday,  the online retailer came out as a freight hauler in a big way with a flyover of the first Amazon-branded Boeing 767 cargo plane as part of Seattle's Seafair summer festival. Over the last six months Amazon has been moving into air freight with the leasing of 40 air freighters through its air cargo partners Atlas Air and ATSG. The company currently has 11 dedicated airplanes flying with more rolling out in the coming months, according to the company. In honor of its importance in getting deliveries out to Prime members, Amazon gave the first airplane in its dedicated fleet a tail number made up of a Prime number — N1997A. USA TODAY Amazon keeps expanding its empire Seattle Seafair is a much-loved 66-year-old event that features hydroplane races on Lake Washington, a flotilla of ships along the waterfront, a downtown torchlight parade and an air show. "Amazon One" flew over crowds near Lake Washington during the Boeing Seafair Air Show. It was listed only as "special guest flyover" in the program, and proceeded the U.S. Navy Blue Angels flight demonstration team. "I cannot imagine a better way to celebrate the inaugural flight than in our hometown at Seafair alongside Amazon employees and Seattle residents,"  said Dave Clark, Amazon’s senior vice president of worldwide operations.

Amazon Amazon is shipping enough packages across the U.S. that it is starting to need its own planes. Now we know what they look like. At a media event Thursday, Aug. 4, in Seattle, Amazon took the wraps off its first “Prime Air” branded plane, a Boeing 767 owned by Atlas Air that has been converted into a freighter. Amazon announced deals with two aircraft leasing companies — Atlas, and another called Air Transport Services Group, or ATSG — earlier this year to fly as many as 40 dedicated cargo planes over the next two years. Eleven are already in operation; this is the first one that’s been painted. The idea is to provide Amazon enough shipping capacity for peak periods and flexibility for normal operations as its Prime business grows, Amazon’s Senior Vice President of Operations Dave Clark told Recode in an interview. (In the second quarter, Amazon’s North America sales grew 28 percent year over year to almost $18 billion. Amazon’s tens of millions of Prime members are its best customers and receive free two-day shipping on many items as part of their $99 annual membership.) “You can almost think about the difference between commercial flight and private flight,” Clark said. “We have the ability, with our own planes, to create connections between one point and another point that are exactly tailored to our needs, and exactly tailored to the timing of when we want to put packages on those routes — versus other peoples’ networks which are optimized to run their entire network. We add capacity, we add flexibility, and it gives us cost-control capability as well.” As one example, Clark said the flights will be helpful for east coast-west coast runs for certain specialized inventory and imports. Amazon can use the planes for both shipments to customers and to move goods between its facilities. The move comes as Amazon further vertically integrates its business. In addition to leasing dedicated cargo planes, it has grown its number of fulfillment and sorting centers to more than 145 worldwide, is building out its own local delivery service in some markets, has invested in numerous logistics technologies and is buying or leasing truck trailers and cargo ships. It has also built out its own cloud-computing and web-hosting platform that is now a $10 billion-a-year business, designed its own electronic devices, runs a delightful voice-based assistant that could be the future of shopping, built a surprisingly successful TV-streaming service and is selling its own private-label goods that range from HDMI cables to “Happy Belly” coffee beans. So, why not control some airplanes? The aircraft’s paint job, previewed to a handful of journalists and partners at a Boeing hangar in Seattle, is mostly white, with “Prime Air” on both sides, a blue bottom that leads up the fuselage into a stripe, and a dark gray tail with Amazon’s “smile” logo on it. (And, fun fact: Its tail number, N1997A, features a prime number — get it? — and is the year Amazon went public.) There is also an Amazon logo stenciled onto the bottom — to remind people watching from below which company they order paper towels and Kindles from.

The company said it flew 894,240 passengers during the period, representing a growth of 0.6 per cent from the year before as its two Boeing B777 planes dropped off the fleet after their sale to a US airline. “Despite the reduced capacity the airline increased the seats flown during the period by 1.6 per cent to 1.58 million due to efficient use of aircrafts,” KQ, as the airline is known by its international code, said in a statement. “During the period the airline revised its network to improve connectivity through its hub Nairobi and more so densify its presence in Africa.” The Nairobi Securities Exchange-listed firm increased capacity on African routes by 15 per cent in line with its focus on the continent.

The aviation actuator systems market is projected to grow from USD 822.3 million in 2016 to USD 1090.9 million by 2021, at a CAGR of 5.82%. Factors influencing the growth of this market include the rise in demand for advanced automation systems worldwide. This factor is compelling actuator manufacturers to invest in technologically-advanced actuators for advanced automation systems. Electrohydrostatic actuators segment is projected to grow at highest CAGR among all product type segments during the forecast period. This is due to its advantages such as energy savings, low investment costs, high power density and power capacity, fail-safe functionality, and easy integration into existing infrastructure. The automotive aviation actuator systems market in the North America region is growing at the highest rate. Increasing passenger traffic, along with low oil prices and steady labor market, has led the key manufacturers in the region such as Boeing (U.S.), and Bombardier (Canada) to increase their production. The U.S. is the leading manufacturer of military aircraft and the growing demand of these military aircraft in APAC and Middle East regions is expected to have a positive impact on the aviation actuator systems market in North America.

Share story By Sandy Deneau Dunham Pacific NW magazine associate editor THERE’S NO PLACE like home. Dorothy might have said it most famously (and repeatedly), but it’s quite possible Paul and Laurie Bride say it most purposefully. “We weren’t creating a house,” Paul says of the couple’s amazingly thought-out Ames Lake retirement home, nestled in the forest as naturally as a curled-up fawn. “We were creating a living place. ‘Place’ means a lot of things to peoples and cultures. It’s not just where you are and what you do; it’s what you use, how you use the environment — all have a lot to do with a sense of the place where you are.” The Brides, who met working at Boeing and have been married since 1976, certainly know their place. They knew it so thoroughly, they presented co-creators Stephen Bobbitt (Stephen Bobbitt Architects) and Patrick Leuner (Leuner Landscape Design) with an exceptionally detailed vision of it. “We had strong desires in terms of what we wanted,” Paul says: wildlife, views, nature; southerly exposure; minimum site disruption; maximum accessibility; natural materials; quiet areas, for reading or listening to music; and more-active ones. Three of the home’s four pavilions are connected by identical closed hallways (links), all the same width and height. This entry link connects the Commons to the bedroom pavilion, with the home’s only stairs at the far end. (This is the Brides’ retirement home, so the link is outfitted with a wheelchair stair lift in case it’s needed later.) (Benjamin Benschneider/The Seattle Times) Most Read Stories UW cornerback Darren Gardenhire announces he's leaving team Thanksgiving, Apple Cup travel alert: ‘Parade of storms’ to bring rain, wind, mountain snow Cops, homelessness and goodbye to Pronto: Seattle’s new budget Boeing goes outside for new Commercial Airplanes CEO Quarter-mile walk from light rail to Sea-Tac could get a little cozierUnlimited Digital Access. $1 for 4 weeks. “It’s the most comprehensive program I’ve ever received from a client, down to particular colors in the garden: reds that shift toward the purple end of the spectrum,” says Bobbitt, who worked with the Brides on a previous home in the 1980s. “Good info.” Even better results. Inspired by the Cedar River Watershed Education Center near North Bend, and the result of “close collaboration” between owners and designers, the Brides’ ultra-custom home groups and connects buildings — all while connecting buildings, and residents, to nature. “Stephen created the concept of a set of four pavilions,” Paul says: • The Commons: A grand skylighted great room whose cathedral-ceiling Douglas fir paneling was milled from trees on-site. “For a long time, squirrels and birds were building nests in them,” Paul says. “We’ve used them respectfully again as shelter.” • The Bedroom: A quiet echo of the living room: more native wood, but a slightly lower ceiling. Also a guest bedroom and bathroom, plus the pretty-and-functional office and laundry. • The Garage: That place you park a car is so much more here, forming a pavilion with a lower-level exercise/rec room, mudroom, bathroom and shower. • The Workshop: Across the way, the only one detached, for wood- and metalworking. Douglas fir milled from trees on-site covers the cathedral ceiling in the great room, with maple cabinetry throughout the kitchen. “None of the design decisions were made without discussion of what fit with the aesthetic,” Paul Bride says: “What’s local? What would give it an indigenous feel?” (Benjamin Benschneider/The Seattle Times) From outside, all four pavilions share the same basic gable appearance and form. The three connecting pavilions are joined by closed hallway links, all the same width, height and pitch all the way through. A grand-piano entryway distinguishes the center link; a short stairway leads to the garage pavilion on one end; and a convertible screened porch, with the exact 12-foot-wide profile and 4/12 pitch of a link, pushes out the other. “The links are the circulation spine,” Bobbitt says. “There’s a heightened contrast between the links and the pavilions: exposed framing, different roof pitches, glazing. They have much different character than the pavilions to make them feel like a covered walkway.” The other distinct link: nature, nature — everywhere. A perfect spot for crossword puzzles and up-close nature viewing, the seating area in the great room looks through expansive Lindal windows toward an “intensively landscaped pond.” (Benjamin Benschneider/The Seattle Times) “There’s lots of interaction with what’s going on outside: animal inhabitants, environment, weather,” Paul says. “To me it’s just natural to be in and amongst nature. You couldn’t get me to live in a downtown high-rise. I want to be where the critters are.” This is the place for critters. The Brides’ decidedly non-high-rise home sits on 2.5 peaceful, private acres of a 20-acre parcel that was split into four lots; 12.5 acres in the middle are protected, with a “critter magnet” of a pond hiding in a 50-foot depression. “You can’t see it, but you know it’s there,” Paul says. You can see the critters, though: hummingbirds, year-round. Deer, naturally. Black bear, right there on the walkway last October. Squirrels of many colors. Raccoons, chipmunks, coyotes. Salamanders, frogs, newts. Ducks, woodpeckers, “pterodactyl-like” blue heron. Sitting areas near windows are designed precisely for wildlife-watching. (Laurie’s favorite is in the master bedroom; Paul prefers a bigger chair overlooking their own, smaller pond or, as Bobbitt calls it, “the training pond.”) And, because this place is their habitat, too, accessibility — now and in the future — also is a priority. Paul Bride says the Asian-inspired entry gatehouse conveys “a strong presence that here you cross a boundary. What’s inside this compound is very distinct from what goes on in the developed world.” (Benjamin Benschneider/The Seattle Times) “This is our retirement home,” Laurie says. So the stairway link houses a wheelchair stair lift, in case. The garage pavilion could function as a separate living area — or a caretaker’s residence. It’s all “the result of many years’ planning … including features to enable them to age in place,” Bobbitt says. “All of that — along with a quintessential Northwest wooded site — is a part of their somewhat unique story.” And their clearly one-of-a-kind place. “When I talk about place, it’s not outside, inside or a building,” Paul says. “It’s always a place for us, and everything outside.” Sandy Deneau Dunham writes about architecture and design for Pacific NW magazine.

It said production of the first upgraded B61-12 nuclear bombs will begin in fiscal year 2020. All remaining bombs will be adapted by 2024. Authorizing the B61-12 warhead life-extension program (LEP) is the final development phase prior to actual production. According to reports, unlike the free-fall gravity bombs it will replace, the B61-12 is a guided nuclear bomb. A new tail kit assembly, made by Boeing, enables the bomb to hit targets far more precisely than its predecessors. Using “Dial-a-yield” technology, the bomb's explosive force can be adjusted before launch from a high of 50,000 tons of TNT equivalent to a low of 300 tons. The B61-12 will have both air- and ground-burst capability. The capability to penetrate below the surface has significant implications for the types of targets within the bomb’s reach. The B61-12 will initially be integrated with B-2, F-15E, F-16, and Tornado aircraft. From the 2020s, the weapon will also be integrated with, first, the F-35A bomber-fighter F-35 and later the LRS-B next-generation long-range bomber. © Flickr/ Sandia Labs US B61-12 Nuke Program 'Uniquely Destabilizing,' Breach of Disarmament Obligations - NGOThe B61-12 will replace the existing B61-3, —4, —7, and —10 bomb designs. It is thought that approximately 480 B61-12s will be produced through the mid-2020s. Currently around 200 B61 bombs are deployed in underground vaults inside around 90 protective aircraft shelters at six bases in five NATO countries (Belgium, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, and Turkey). Two of which would utilize US aircraft (one air base in Incirlik, Turkey and one in Aviano, Italy). Non-US aircraft are assigned to other bases (Kleine Brogel, Belgium; Büchel, Germany; Ghedi Torre, Italy; and Volkel, The Netherlands). In September last year German television station ZDF cited a Pentagon budget document saying that the US Air Force would deploy modernized B61 nuclear bombs to Germany’s Buchel air force base replacing the 20 weapons already at the site. “In other words, the American modernized thermonuclear aircraft bomb has been primarily, and for the nearest quarter of a century, destined to Europe. Washington however does not specify how and from whom the modernized nuclear bombs are going to defend the continent,” says an analytical article on the RIA Novosti website. © Flickr/ Sandia Labs Russian Experts Assess US Plans to Extend B61-12 Nuclear Bomb Lifespan“However it is easy to guess that the thermonuclear bombs will be first of all used for the ‘deterrence” of Russia and the rest of Europe will fall hostage to the circumstances orchestrated from across the ocean,” the website adds. Back in September 2015, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov characterized the move as a potential “violation of the strategic balance in Europe,” that would demand a Russian response. “This could alter the balance of power in Europe,” Peskov then said. “And without a doubt it would demand that Russia take necessary countermeasures to restore the strategic balance and parity.” ...

Just to shorten the distance a bit. I just wonder why there are no protests on the streets in Europe against the stationing of those nuclear bombs. Now would be the time for the Greens to take a stand.... but they are in cahoots with the guys who own those bombs... what a strange world. Reply Miguelon 17:25 05.08.2016 | 0 | Edit | Delete This is the silliest weapon in the US inventory. It is a free fall bomb that must be attached to an aircraft to deliver. Guess what that means in a practical sense? The US must have battlefield air superiority to use it. With a combination of fighters and S-x00 air defenses, that is not likely to happen over any Russian territory. Additionally, let's say the US does have air superiority. What would they use it against? By that I mean that if the US was somehow able to achieve air superiority in Russian airspace, the free fall nuke would not be needed. This is a weapon that has no purpose or value.

They will all have very large targets on these NATO countries, as ,if a war breaks out, the Russians will have to neutralize all missile bases in Europe for their own survival. Too bad! The EU doesn't see what the US has planned for them!They will provide time for the US to implement a first strike against Russia.

International Business Times, India Edition International Business Times, India Edition India World Business Technology Sports Entertainment Auto Health Photos Video Search Search Home Companies Lockheed Martin will shift F-16 fighter jet manufacturing unit to India if it gets assured orders The challenge before Lockheed is to use its competitive production advantage into winning this deal, says an aerospace expert. Asmita Sarkar   August 5, 2016 18:19 IST 3 Shares 3 Shares Lockheed Martin will make F-16s for India if it gets assured orders Pictured: A U.S. Air Force F-16 Fighting Falcon flies a mission in the skies near Iraq on March 22, 2003 during Operation Iraqi freedom. [Representational Image]Wikimedia Commons American aerospace and weapons manufacturer Lockheed Martin has said that it would shift production of F-16s to India, under the Make in India scheme, from its Texas unit if the Indian Air Force (IAF) gives it assured orders. The F-16 jet is a preferred aircraft not just by India but also Pakistan, and since the company would also be looking at exporting the aircraft to other countries, the decision would stay with India, said Lockheed's spokesperson. Why advertise with us? Related India in talks with Russia to upgrade Sukhois into 'Super Sukhois' US-Pakistan relations on downward slide, Sartaj Aziz says; blames 'Indian lobby' for F-16 block The Lockheed Martin's national executive Abhay Paranjape said that the company would consider switching its manufacturing unit to India only if the IAF gives it assured orders. "We have had multiple discussions with the government and the industry. There has been a level of interest ...we have not been told to go away," he said.  The manufacturing unit would be a "huge boost to the market and a further diversification of the Indian economy," aerospace expert Saj Ahmad, who is chief analyst at StrategicAero Research, told International Business Times, India. "Given the constraints on US defence spending through sequestration, there's a good chance Lockheed Martin could opt to house production overseas - although this will be driven by the size and scope of any orders alongside any other governmental incentives such as tax breaks," said Ahmad. On Lockheed Martin outbidding its competitors Boeing, Ahmad said: "Lockheed certainly has the edge here given that it's the number one defence company but bidders like Boeing will fight hard to make their presence felt. Given how convoluted procurement processes are in relation to defence in India, it really is too close to call as to who'll get the final nod." For Lockheed to seriously consider moving its manufacturing unit, "any Indian order has to be significant enough not just for its production to move to India, but be big enough to drive down supply chain costs as well," he said. "As of now, it's premature to speculate just how competitive productions costs will actually be." With Lockheed Martin shifting base to India it would also be closer to the South East Asia market and with that it could make inroads to the South China Sea dispute. It would almost certainly be a big platform to spur more Asian sales, particularly at a time when traditional big buyers in Europe and the UK are also curtailing defence spending. The south China Sea dispute though will require the ratcheting down of military hardware presence and a boost to diplomatic talks in order to make progress to that particular stalemate," said Ahmad. He further added that the Bengaluru Aerospace Park would make most sense "given that that is essentially what it was primed for from the get-go." The challenge before all that is to see whether Lockheed's competitive production advantage can be harnessed into winning this deal first," he added.

The firm has offered to move its only production line for the fighter jets from Fort Worth, Texas to India from where F-16s could be exported. Lockheed’s national executive (India) Abhay Paranjape, however, clarified that the establishing the production line here was conditional on assured orders from Indian Air Force. “We have had multiple discussions with the government and the industry. There has been a level of interest …we have not been told to go away,” he said. Lockheed has proposed to build the latest variant of the fighter – F-16 Block 70 – under the Make in India programme. Other aerospace biggies who have shown interest in building fighter jets in India are US firm Boeing, Sweden’s Saab, France’s Dassault Aviation and the Eurofighter Typhoon consortium. The Block D variants come packed with superior radars, advanced avionics and sensors, new weapons, improved situational awareness for pilots and enhanced operational capabilities to keep pace with rapidly evolving military requirements. Lockheed’s current orders will keep the Fort Worth F-16 line running till late 2017 and the firm is eyeing another order that could extend its life till 2021, said Randall L Howard, who looks after business development at the firm. So far, the firm has delivered 4,588 F-16s to 27 international air forces, including that of Pakistan. The PAF operates more than 80 F-16s, including 13 second-hand F-16A/B Block 15 jets bought from the Royal Jordanian Air Force in 2014. Bulk of the Pakistani fleet consists of older F-16A/B fighters, now upgraded to Block 52 standards in Turkey. It also has 18 F-16C/D Bulk of the Pakistani fleet consists of older F-16A/B fighters, now upgraded to Block 52 standards in Turkey. It also has 18 F-16C/D Block 50/52 planes. ‘Block’ refers to the F-16 evolution, with a higher number representing technological upgrades. Howard said the Block 70 fighters would be the finest combat planes in the region. Asked to comment on Pakistan operating F-16s and Lockheed planning to make India its export base, he said, “Decisions for fighter sales are not taken by Lockhe,those decisions are made by governments.” Howard said building the planes in India would drive down the production cost and increase its demand worldwide. Lockheed officials were non committal on the kind of investment the firm planned to make in India.

Amazon unveiled its first branded cargo plane Thursday, one of 40 jetliners that will make up Amazon's own air transportation network of 40 Boeing jets leased from Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings and Air Transport Services Group Inc., which will operate the air cargo network. (AP Photo/Ted S. Warren) .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... ..........SEATTLE — Seattle-based Amazon is unveiling its first branded cargo plane, one of 40 jetliners that will make up the e-commerce giant’s own air transportation network as it takes more control of its delivery process. The latest push to speed delivery of its products comes as the company ships an increasing number of packages worldwide. Amazon’s parcel volume was an estimated 1 billion packages in 2015. By way of comparison, in the 2016 fiscal year FedEx delivered about 3 billion packages for hundreds of thousands of customers. Amazon has had issues with the reliability of air freight services. In 2013, it offered refunds to customers who received their Christmas orders late after bad weather and a jump in online shopping caused delays for UPS and FedEx. Analysts say it makes sense for Amazon to use an air fleet it controls as another way to get its products to online shoppers drawn to fast, no-extra-cost delivery. Advertisement Continue reading “They’re such a big online retailer,” said Satish Jindel, president of shipping consultant ShipMatrix. “There’s so much volume that if you have to add transportation for yourself, why would you pay a retail price when you can get wholesale? It makes sense.” Amazon revealed its first branded “Prime Air” cargo plane, designated Amazon One, on Friday at the annual Seafair Air Show. The plane buzzed over Seattle’s Lake Washington just before the Navy’s Blue Angels took to the skies. Amazon leased 40 Boeing jets from Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings and Air Transport Services Group Inc., which will operate the air cargo network. Eleven of the planes already are delivering packages for Amazon’s annual Prime loyalty program, which offers free two-day shipping and other perks. The remaining freighters will be rolled out in the next couple of years. Aircraft like Amazon One allow the company to “continue to maintain our fast delivery speeds and lower our costs as our Prime base and our Prime member growth continue to soar,” said Dave Clark, Amazon’s senior vice president of worldwide operations. Despite its growing fleet of aircraft, Amazon said it plans to continue to use FedEx, UPS and other transportation partners. “Because of our growth and the sheer amount of packages, we are supplementing our transportation needs,” Clark said. The company has been furiously building out distribution centers, where workers and robots pull products off shelves and package them for delivery, as well as smaller sorting plants, which arrange packages by ZIP code for faster delivery. It has a network of more than 125 fulfillment centers worldwide. Amazon recently reported a second-quarter profit of $857 million on $30 billion in revenue. The company doesn’t yet have plans to carry packages for others but says it’s constantly evaluating its situation. Amazon has not been shy about competing in businesses areas far-flung from its e-commerce roots. “Once you have those planes, it certainly creates the opportunity for new products for customers,” Clark said, adding: “Stay tuned and we’ll see what happens in the future.” ___ This story has been updated to remove an incorrect reference to the number of packages FedEx delivered in 2012.

Source: AAP 5 Aug 2016 - 3:38 PM  UPDATED 5 Aug 2016 - 3:38 PM Tweet Qantas is holding off taking delivery of eight A380 superjumbos ordered more than a decade ago because they don't fit with its current plans for growth in Asia. Australia's biggest airline has 12 superjumbos in operation, which fly to London, Los Angeles and Dallas. Since the order of eight extra A380s was confirmed under previous boss Geoff Dixon, Qantas has changed significantly, in terms of its strategy and financial position. "We will keep pushing them out," Mr Joyce said of the extra A380s on Friday, at a summit hosted by CAPA Centre for Aviation. He was non-committal on whether the purchase would go ahead. While North America remains Qantas' biggest market, Mr Joyce and his team are looking to Asia, particularly China, for profit growth. Given Australia's close proximity to the region, Qantas doesn't need as many A380s for those routes. Qantas currently flies smaller planes, including A330s and Boeing 747s to Asia, and will also begin using Boeing 787-9 Dreamliners in 2018. "It's all about the `right aircraft, right route'," a Qantas spokesman said. Not all airports can accommodate A380s, also making the smaller and more fuel efficient Boeing 787 attractive. Qantas - which has slashed staff numbers and costs in recent years - is also saving millions of dollars by not taking delivery of the eight A380s. The financial details of its orders with Airbus remain confidential, but an A380-800 has a list price of $US433 million, though discounts are typically given to airlines at the time of a large order. Qantas is planning to announce its first route using a 787-9 Dreamliner at the end of the year, and is considering a direct Perth to London link, Mr Joyce said. It is also considering the introduction of new routes including Brisbane to the US, Melbourne to Dallas and Sydney to Chicago, he said.

By Ananya Roy August 5, 2016 05:38 BST Close Embed Feed Australia examines possible MH370 plane debris found in Tanzania IBTimes US <iframe src="http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/videos/embed/19434" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe> Authorities in Malaysia have finally confirmed that the pilot of the doomed flight MH370, which went missing two years ago, had a practice route towards the southern Indian Ocean on his home simulator. However, the country's Transport Minister said that this does not prove that pilot Zaharie Ahmad Shah deliberately drowned the plane into the ocean. The flight path found on Shah's simulator was very similar to the off-course route that the Beijing-bound plane is believed to have taken on the fateful day when it disappeared. This was first reported by New York magazine last month, but authorities in Malaysia had so far dismissed the report.

Hazards Earth Syst. Sci An air crash expert had recently claimed that analysis of a wing part of the Boeing 777 found on Reunion Island in 2015 showed that the plane was glided into the ocean, contrary to theories about the flight – carrying 239 passengers and crew members – crashing into the ocean after fuel exhaustion. However, commenting for the first time on the deepening controversy surrounding the pilot, transport minister Liow Tiong Lai told reporters on Thursday (4 August) that investigations into the plane's disappearance is underway and that they are yet to find evidence to confirm that "Captain Zaharie flew [the plane] to the Indian Ocean". "Yes, there is a simulation... shows [flights] to many parts of the world, but it is one of many," Liow was quoted by the Wall Street Journal as saying. He added that with "thousands" of such flight paths on Captain Shah's home simulator, it was not fair to conclude that he deliberately flew the plane into the ocean. Liow said that French authorities were "still conducting investigation and further verification of the flaperon [the wing part] pending some documentation and information from several authorities, including Boeing." Malaysia has confirmed that the missing MH370's pilot had practised flight path towards Indian Ocean, but denied that it proves Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah is guilty. Family members of the victims want authorities to come clear on the controversy and continue the search until the plane is locatedReuters/Thomas Peter Australia's Joint Agency Coordination Center, which is overseeing the search for the missing plane in the southern Indian Ocean, had previously confirmed reports about the suicide flight path on Zaharie's flight simulator. Australian Transport Safety Bureau, in its update on the ongoing search had said on 3 August that more than 110,000sq km of the seafloor has been searched so far of the designated 120,000 sq km. Australian authorities are hopeful that the plane would be located in the remaining area. Pieces of debris from the missing plane have been found by some tourists along beaches of Madagascar, Reunion Island and Mauritius – which are located far away from the designated search area. Much to the dissatisfaction of the families of the victims, Malaysia, Australia and China have agreed that they will suspend the search after the earmarked seafloor is scoured, unless they achieve a major breakthrough.

Amazon Amazon is shipping enough packages across the U.S. that it is starting to need its own planes. Now we know what they look like. At a media event Thursday, Aug. 4, in Seattle, Amazon took the wraps off its first “Prime Air” branded plane, a Boeing 767 owned by Atlas Air that has been converted into a freighter. Amazon announced deals with two aircraft leasing companies — Atlas, and another called Air Transport Services Group, or ATSG — earlier this year to fly as many as 40 dedicated cargo planes over the next two years. Eleven are already in operation; this is the first one that’s been painted. The idea is to provide Amazon enough shipping capacity for peak periods and flexibility for normal operations as its Prime business grows, Amazon’s Senior Vice President of Operations Dave Clark told Recode in an interview. (In the second quarter, Amazon’s North America sales grew 28 percent year over year to almost $18 billion. Amazon’s tens of millions of Prime members are its best customers and receive free two-day shipping on many items as part of their $99 annual membership.) “You can almost think about the difference between commercial flight and private flight,” Clark said. “We have the ability, with our own planes, to create connections between one point and another point that are exactly tailored to our needs, and exactly tailored to the timing of when we want to put packages on those routes — versus other peoples’ networks which are optimized to run their entire network. We add capacity, we add flexibility, and it gives us cost-control capability as well.” As one example, Clark said the flights will be helpful for east coast-west coast runs for certain specialized inventory and imports. Amazon can use the planes for both shipments to customers and to move goods between its facilities. The move comes as Amazon further vertically integrates its business. In addition to leasing dedicated cargo planes, it has grown its number of fulfillment and sorting centers to more than 145 worldwide, is building out its own local delivery service in some markets, has invested in numerous logistics technologies and is buying or leasing truck trailers and cargo ships. It has also built out its own cloud-computing and web-hosting platform that is now a $10 billion-a-year business, designed its own electronic devices, runs a delightful voice-based assistant that could be the future of shopping, built a surprisingly successful TV-streaming service and is selling its own private-label goods that range from HDMI cables to “Happy Belly” coffee beans. So, why not control some airplanes? The aircraft’s paint job, previewed to a handful of journalists and partners at a Boeing hangar in Seattle, is mostly white, with “Prime Air” on both sides, a blue bottom that leads up the fuselage into a stripe, and a dark gray tail with Amazon’s “smile” logo on it. (And, fun fact: Its tail number, N1997A, features a prime number — get it? — and is the year Amazon went public.) There is also an Amazon logo stenciled onto the bottom — to remind people watching from below which company they order paper towels and Kindles from.

The plane at right was unaffected Dubai-based airline Emirates has confirmed that there were no fatalities on a flight from India that crash-landed . The carrier says “all passengers and crew are accounted for and safe.” It raised the number of people onboard the flight to 300, saying there were 282 passengers, 18 crew.(Hayen Ayari via AP)More DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — An Emirates airliner that crash landed in Dubai on Wednesday tried to regain altitude in the last moments before it hit the ground, transponder data and air traffic control communications suggest. The airline and investigators have not confirmed the findings, and aviation experts caution that much remains unknown about the cause of the crash. But the data, if confirmed by the plane's black boxes, indicate the crew of Flight No. EK521 was starting to go around for a second landing attempt when something went horribly wrong. Transponder data from the Boeing 777-300 obtained by aviation website FlightRadar24.com show the descending plane came close to the ground at 12:37 p.m. local time before altitude readings and the vertical speed suddenly increased, indicating the start of a go-around. That came around the same time an air traffic control radio recording has someone calling out the flight's number and saying "returning to 4,000." "I think it indicates that there was some kind of effort to try to gain altitude," Mikael Robertsson, a co-founder of FlightRadar24, told The Associated Press. But within 12 seconds, the aircraft descended and struck the ground, apparently bouncing back up briefly before coming down and stopping, according to the data. At the time of the crash landing, the scorching mid-day sun had raised temperatures at the airport to a humid 49 degrees Celsius (120 degrees Fahrenheit). Barefoot passengers fleeing the plane said they burned their feet on the scalding tarmac. While that's not an unusual temperature for this time of year, the hotter the conditions are, the harder it can be for engines to lift airplanes off the ground, according to experts. Winds of 39 kilometers an hour (24 mph) blew toward the northwest at the airfield at the time of the crash-landing, according to the United Arab Emirates' National Center for Meteorology and Seismology. The possibility of wind shear — a sudden change in wind speed or direction — is also being looked into by investigators, Emirates CEO and chairman Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum has said. An attempted go-around could explain why the grounded plane's landing gear did not appear to be extended. "If the airplane had gone around, part of the maneuver is retracting the landing gear," said commercial airline pilot and author Patrick Smith. "It's conceivable that during the go-around that they experienced a dangerous wind shear," he said. John Gadzinski, an airline captain and aviation safety consultant, agreed that the transponder data was consistent with an attempted go-around by the crew. He cautioned however that the readings are not as precise as those on the airplane's own flight data recorder, and that investigators will need more information to determine what went wrong. Emirates officials have repeatedly declined to say definitively whether the plane was attempting to go around and whether the landing gear was properly deployed. The UAE's General Civil Aviation Authority, which is leading the investigation, said Thursday it was still working to recover the flight data and cockpit voice recorders. American and British investigators will participate in the probe because the Boeing plane was built in the U.S. and was powered by British-made Rolls-Royce Trent 800 engines. Chicago-based Boeing said it is prepared to deploy a technical team to assist with the investigation in coordination with the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board. It referred queries on the investigation to the GCAA, which plans to issue a preliminary report on the crash within a month. The crash continued to snarl travel plans well into Thursday. Dubai International Airport, the world's busiest in terms of international traffic, said it was running "under restricted capacity and has since continued to operate with one runway." Some flights were being redirected to the city-state's second airport, Al Maktoum International Airport at Dubai World Central. By Thursday night, investigators had removed the charred carcass of the plane from the runway and reopened the affected runway, Dubai Airports CEO Paul Griffiths said. The crash-landing did little damage to the runway itself as the plane came to rest and burned off to the side of it, he said. Read More Flight EK521 was carrying 282 passengers and 18 crew members on its return from Thiruvananthapuram, India. Emirates said 157 passengers stayed in Dubai following the accident, while the rest remained in transit at the airport. Five who suffered minor injuries were taken to local hospitals, the airline said. A cabin crew member was hospitalized and was expected to be released Thursday. "They were very fortunate to get everybody out. That's a very positive thing to the cabin crew and to the design of the airplane," Gadzinski said. A firefighter, Jassim al-Balooshi, was killed in an explosion while battling the blaze. He was buried Thursday in the emirate of Ras al-Khaimah. The GCAA meanwhile issued a warning on Twitter for people to stop "publishing videos, news or pictures of aviation's accidents." "Sharing such practices is considered to be irresponsible and disrespectful to the victims, and is punishable under (hashtag)UAE law," the authority said. The UAE, while liberal compared to many Mideast nations, has stiff penalties for those convicted of publishing photos of someone without their consent or offending them. That call may be a little late, considering the worldwide attention on the accident. It came as an online video apparently made immediately after the crash circulated showing the chaos inside the plane. In the footage, some passengers frantically reach for dangling oxygen masks even though the plane has come to a stop. Over the loud speaker, a man's voice calmly calls out: "Cabin crew, this is the captain: evacuate, evacuate." Light gray smoke fills the cabin as some grabbed personal belongings in the overhead bins. "Please don't do that! Leave everything!" another man shouts, presumably a member of the flight crew. "Leave the bag! Jump and slide!" Another crew member runs past empty rows of seats, likely checking for anyone left behind. The camera shakes as a woman's voice screams for passengers to jump down an inflatable emergency slide. Finally, bright light fills the video as the person filming comes outside the plane, pausing only for a moment to look at a burning jet engine on the damaged plane's wing before fleeing to safety. ___ Follow Jon Gambrell and Adam Schreck on Twitter at www.twitter.com/jongambrellap and www.twitter.com/adamschreck .

PetroTalk Infogram Docs فارسی French فارسی French US planning preemptive nuclear attack: North Korea Sat Aug 6, 2016 10:15PM Home Asia-Pacific Koreas File photo shows a US air force Rockwell B-1 Lancer bomber (Photos by AFP) North Korea says the US is planning a preemptive nuclear attack after Washington announces the deployment of B-1 bombers in the Pacific. On Saturday, the North said the US is "becoming all the more pronounced in their moves to topple down the DPRK by mobilizing all nuclear war hardware." The strategic bombers were set to be deployed in the US Island of Guam on Saturday in a move which the Pentagon calls a routine rotation with the B-52 bombers. "The enemies are bluffing that they can mount a preemptive nuclear strike on the DPRK by letting fly B-1B over the Korean peninsula within two-three hours in contingency," said a statement released on North Korean state media. On July 29, the US air force announced that it would be the first time that B-1s are sent to Guam since April 2006. Designed by Rockwell International (now part of Boeing), the Rockwell B-1 Lancer is a four-engine heavy strategic bomber used by the US air force as a supersonic bomber with Mach 2 speed. This undated photo released by North Korea's official Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) on July 21, 2016 shows a missile fired during a drill by Hwasong artillery units of the Strategic Force of the Korean People's Army. "Such moves for bolstering nuclear force exposes again that the US imperialists are making a preemptive nuclear strike on the DPRK a fait accompli," added the Pyongyang statement. Earlier in July, the North pledged a “physical response” to US deployment of the sophisticated THAAD missile system in Korean Peninsula.  THAAD interceptor is launched during a test in this undated handout photo provided by the Pentagon. Tensions have been flaring in the region since January, when North Korea said it had successfully detonated a hydrogen bomb, its fourth nuclear test, and vowed to build up its nuclear program as deterrence against potential aggression from the US and its regional allies.     A month later, Pyongyang launched a long-range rocket which it said placed an earth observation satellite into orbit. However, Washington and Seoul denounced it as a cover for an intercontinental ballistic missile test.​ Loading ...

In a speech at an airline conference in Brisbane, Qantas CEO Alan Joyce said current demand is being met by the 12 A380s they already have in their fleet. To rub salt into Airbus' wound, Qantas also said any growth would be catered for by the arrival of the 787-9 Dreamliner produced by Airbus rival, Boeing. Qantas deploys the A380 on longhaul flights, with superjumbos flying routes like Sydney to London via Dubai or direct from Sydney or Melbourne to Dallas or Los Angeles. Last month Airbus announced it would cut production of the A380s from 27 per year to just 12. Emirates are by far the biggest customer for the A380, they have 81 in their fleet with 61 yet to be delivered. Each Airbus costs more than $595 million. Newshub.

The latest push to speed delivery comes as the company ships an increasing number of packages worldwide. Amazon’s parcel volume was an estimated 1 billion packages in 2015. By way of comparison, in the 2016 fiscal year FedEx delivered about 3 billion packages for hundreds of thousands of customers. Amazon has had issues with the reliability of air freight services. In 2013, it offered refunds to customers who received their Christmas orders late after bad weather and a jump in online shopping caused delays for UPS and FedEx. Analysts say it makes sense for Amazon to use an air fleet it controls as another way to get its products to online shoppers drawn to fast, no-extra-cost delivery. “They’re such a big online retailer,” said Satish Jindel, president of shipping consultant ShipMatrix. “There’s so much volume that if you have to add transportation for yourself, why would you pay a retail price when you can get wholesale? It makes sense.” Amazon revealed its first branded “Prime Air” cargo plane, designated Amazon One, on Friday at the annual Seafair Air Show. The plane buzzed over Seattle’s Lake Washington just before the Navy’s Blue Angels took to the skies. Amazon leased 40 Boeing jets from Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings and Air Transport Services Group Inc., which will operate the air cargo network. Eleven of the planes already are delivering packages for Amazon’s annual Prime loyalty program, which offers free two-day shipping and other perks. The remaining freighters will be rolled out in the next couple of years. Aircraft like Amazon One allow the company to “continue to maintain our fast delivery speeds and lower our costs as our Prime base and our Prime member growth continue to soar,” said Dave Clark, Amazon’s senior vice president of worldwide operations. Despite its growing fleet of aircraft, Amazon said it plans to continue to use FedEx, UPS and other transportation partners. “Because of our growth and the sheer amount of packages, we are supplementing our transportation needs,” Clark said. The company has been furiously building out distribution centers, where workers and robots pull products off shelves and package them for delivery, as well as smaller sorting plants, which arrange packages by ZIP code for faster delivery. It has a network of more than 125 fulfillment centers worldwide. Amazon recently reported a second-quarter profit of $857 million on $30 billion in revenue. The company doesn’t yet have plans to carry packages for others but says it’s constantly evaluating its situation. Amazon has not been shy about competing in businesses areas far-flung from its e-commerce roots. “Once you have those planes, it certainly creates the opportunity for new products for customers,” Clark said, adding: “Stay tuned and we’ll see what happens in the future.” Comments DentonRC.com is now using Facebook Comments.

Ethiopian, Rwandan and Tanzanian airlines will receive new aircraft from next week. TEA GRAPHIC | NATION MEDIA GROUP In Summary Regional airlines are sprucing up their fleets with new aeroplanes. Ethiopian, Rwandan and Tanzanian airlines will receive new aircraft from next week. However, analysts are sceptical about whether demand for air travel in the region is high enough to sustain the fleet expansion programmes. Regional airlines are sprucing up their fleets with new aeroplanes. Ethiopian, Rwandan and Tanzanian airlines will receive new aircraft from next week. Tanzania plans to have its Air Tanzania Company Ltd (ATCL) return to its regional routes. “The government is working on a strategic three-year plan that will see the airline’s fleet revamped. If the discussions come to fruition, Air Tanzania will get two more aircraft from Bombardier in the coming year,” a senior aviation official in Tanzania’s Transport Ministry said. Air Tanzania is majority-owned by the state, but has only one Bombardier Dash 8 and a leased Canadair CRJ 100s, which operates between Dar es Salaam and the Comoros islands, with local routes to Mwanza, Kigoma and Mtwara. Last week, Bombardier Commercial Aircraft announced that Tanzania had signed a $62 million purchase agreement for two Q400 turboprop airliners. Leonard Chamuriho, Permanent Secretary at Tanzania’s Ministry of Transport, Works and Communication, said the Q400 aircraft will provide affordable, convenient and comfortable air transport. “We are committed to providing good service as our business grows to include new destinations in Tanzania and Africa,” Dr Chamuriho said. The aircraft were reportedly purchased after a $20 million loan was processed through the TIB Development Bank. The EastAfrican understands that ATCL has been audited to ensure the company is financially sound. The airline is said to generate $2.8 million monthly, but has been saddled with debts. Last month, Ethiopian Airlines became the first African airline to take delivery of the Airbus A350, in a $2 billion deal that included smaller aircraft. The aeroplane flies on the Addis Ababa to Lagos route, and has also served the Kigali and Entebbe routes; the route is also served by Kenya Airways and RwandAir. Tewolde Gebremariam, group chief executive officer of Ethiopian, said the aircraft had been purchased to stay competitive in the region. “We are taking an aircraft that has cutting edge technology and will be 25 per cent more fuel efficient. We will save on costs while providing comfort,” he said. Aeroplane delivery RwandAir is expecting two Airbus aeroplanes and a Boeing between September and November. The airline is expecting the delivery of its first 244-seat Airbus A330-200 in September, followed by a Boeing B737-800 in October, and a second 274-seat Airbus A330-300 in November. In May 2017, the airline will receive its fourth Boeing B737-800. RwandAir will ply the Johannesburg, Entebbe, Dar es Salaam, Lagos and Accra routes. The aeroplanes will also operate on the long haul routes to Europe and Asia. The airlines’ most lucrative routes are Kigali to Entebbe, Juba, and Nairobi. However, analysts are sceptical about whether demand for air travel in the region is high enough to sustain the fleet expansion programmes. “Even large international airlines have had tumultuous times running a profitable business in the region. It is difficult to foresee a scenario where passenger demand will rise,” said Razia Khan, chief Africa economist at Standard Chartered Bank.

Geza, you went through the trouble of bringing the article here, but why not bring the bombaider and rueters article? stop fixng things, ati acording to bla blah, thats just a cheap way to lie. the article say you signed a $62m agreement and you took a $20m loan witch you used for the purchase, so what is your problem exactly cause the article doea not even talk about if where you got the other $42m. all i can say to you is goodluck, but dont start yapping about ATL here, it will take more that 20years for ATL to get the level of KQ, RwandAir has better chance........ You are still just starting to buy turbo prop airplanes, unless you plan to use them for cargo. I think its was a bad investment, no one buys those planes for commercial use anymore, they are noisy when you sit close to the middle and planes cant go high altitube for long haul distance.... but like i said, good luck, you have to start from somewhere, but atleast you are starting   - 0 people likes G Geza Ulole JF-Expert Member #20 Aug 7, 2016 Joined: Oct 31, 2009 Messages: 8,062 Likes Received: 1,281 Trophy Points: 280 Kuziwa, so u hav already concluded a forex will be accrued by just building a railline or a road to those unproductive areas compared to those already proven productive area! If our projections r to hav 3 mln tourists by 2018, what opportunities do u see? And if over 10 airports already constructed n scattered to nearly every strategic corner of the country, how do we get returns from them? Do we have to just let only the foreign airlines make use of such facilities to benefit themselves and continue to have no say on the kind fare they charge us? Do u hav an idea Dar-Nrb (less than 2 hrs) was over $400? R u aware of roads n rail lines current under construction or about to be constructed? Mention me one forgotten place around the EA compared to Northern Kenya! Uache ujuaji huwezi kusema tuache kuwinda fursa bwerere zilizopo zitokanazo na Jumuiya na rasirimali za utalii kisa kijiji flani hakina barabara! Huku ukijua fika mipango ipo na kuna suala la kurudisha gharama za ujenzi wa miundombinu hiyo! Kama kweli wewe ni mchumi huwezi kukatalia uwepo wa shirika la ndege lenye ndege kama 15-20 hivi Tanzania la kutuwezesha kusafiri kiurahisi kwenda ile miji ya Kibiasha na Kiuchumi ndani na nje ya nchi! Mimi binafsi nachukia makao makuu ya Barrickgold Africa (Acacia) yenye migodi mitano Tanzania (minne dhahabu mmoja nickel) kuwa J'burg na si Mwanza! Ungekuwa mwerevu ungetambua easier logistics play a role! Our competitive edge was not up to the task as far as convincing Barrick Gold put up offices in Mwanza. Ila with current expansion at Mwanza airport n a revamp of Air Tanzania direct connections from other business hubs across the continent and global to Mwanza will be possible and better off affordable as a room for fair competition will be enabled with functioning Air Tanzania. The same is the story for the KIA expansion, it had reached a point we as a nation were public embarrased by our heavily dependence on JKIA and KQ! Plse remind urself of frequent bans on our shuttle buses and our horticulture cargo from accessing JKIA. At times with flimsy excuses like our flowers are contaminated with pests! Kenya's ego had reached to unpreceedented levels n regardless of their KQ making loss n being in need of more business, had dared to grossly misbehaving and bully us to allow them accessing our Parks free of charge in return to our access to their JKIA which has always been at a fee! Will we be able to avoid that by just modernizing our airports and not having a functioning airline? Wewe ni siasa inakuweka upofu na sidhani kama umeipitia bajeti ya 2016/2017 kuona gawio la miundombinu! FYI TCAA and TAA have invested a lot including the two radars about to be acquired n r more than prepared to host a national airline ready to tap into gas n tourism revenues that go hand in hand with good aviation industry since travelling complements the two sectors.

It was Airbus Group’s experimental E-Fan 1.2 hybrid electric airplane being unveiled for the first time in the U.S. The red, white and blue European single-seater — which flies on batteries and regular aviation fuel — is so new and untested that U.S. aviation authorities wouldn’t allow it to fly last month at the Experimental Aircraft Association’s famous AirVenture — more commonly known as “Oshkosh.” “We’re just at the beginning — the seventh test flight,” said Didier Esteyne, the plane’s lead test pilot and designer. “We still have a lot of work to do in front of us.” Dirt and noise So, with the price of traditional fossil fuels so low these days, why so much attention on electric planes? Large commercial jets are blamed for 11% of all global transportation emissions, according to the federal government, and that number is predicted to explode by 50% by 2050. The E-Fan hybrid could help engineers make key breakthroughs to developing cleaner, quieter electric airliners that travelers might be flying on in less than two decades. Crossing the Channel, cleanly and quietly Esteyne made news last year when he flew an all-electric version of the plane — the E-Fan 1.1 — across the English Channel. It was a meaningful moment for him and for everyone who helped develop the aircraft. “Even though I was flying alone, we were many people together when I crossed the Channel,” Esteyne recalled. Esteyne was at Oshkosh to introduce his newest plane to America. Curious air show attendees gathered around him asking questions about how the E-Fan hybrid worked. He told them about how the combustion engine gives the plane a 2-hour-15-minute range — extending the flight time of the previous version — the 1.1 — by an hour and 15 minutes. He explained how the combustion engine sits behind the cockpit, and is only used to charge the plane’s lithium-ion batteries which are embedded in the wings. The combustion engine doesn’t provide any of the plane’s thrust. The two ducted fan engines that do give the plane its thrust are mounted on each side of the fuselage. The plane takes off and lands on electric power only — to make it as quiet as possible. The combustion engine will charge the batteries only during the cruise portion of each flight. Big challenges Let’s not kid ourselves. Lots of technological hurdles stand in the way between the E-Fan and developing electric airliners — challenges like developing lightweight batteries that can store enough electricity for long distance flights. Boeing conducted a small experimental electric hybrid plane program last year in the UK and finished a study with NASA that showed hybrid electric propulsion as having good potential for “air vehicles in the 2030 to 2050 timeline.” What the future holds Airbus is collaborating with Siemens and Daher to build an all-electric two-seater called E-Fan 2.0. It’s first flight is expected sometime next year. But perhaps more importantly, this technology is sowing the seeds for passenger electric planes that we could be flying on as soon as 14 years from now. In April, Siemens announced that it hopes to be selling hybrid electric passenger planes with Airbus by 2030 that will carry up to 100 passengers up to about 620 miles — that’s about the distance from New York to Detroit. The planes would burn 25% less fuel by running electric power during takeoff and landing, Siemens said, making them almost silent at airports. Cutting CO2 emissions is critical, but also, cities will need to build more airports as passenger traffic increases. And that brings with it concerns about noise. “For me, reducing the noise is very important,” Esteyne said. “We know that in cities when you add airports, the noise and pollution are very important. This is the only way to do it.” Noise and CO2 levels are only expected to rise, because in the next 20 years 3.2 billion additional airline passengers are predicted to fly worldwide, according to the International Air Transport Association. Those passengers are going to need more airplanes and airports. It’s a statistic that only puts more pressure on airlines, airports, aviation authorities and governments to find cleaner and quieter ways to fly.

Testing the Vector P-20 Rocket 0:00 0:00 Share this video http://qz.com/747513 Share Written by Tim Fernholz Obsession Space Business August 06, 2016 Back in June, NASA tested a booster for the most powerful rocket it has ever tried to build, the Space Launch System (SLS). The booster alone was more than 150 feet long, producing 3.6 million pounds of force, and reaching temperatures of nearly 6,000°F during a ground test in Promontory, Utah. The whole rocket is so expensive it will probably only fly twice in the next four years, if at all. A month later, in the Mojave Desert, a very different test took place, involving a prototype rocket just 12 feet long. Built by a small company called Vector Space, it flew just a few thousand feet in the air, successfully demonstrating 3-D printed engine parts that will plug into a full-scale version just 42 feet long, not even a third of the size of one of SLS booster. If its designers are right, the Vector 1, as the small rocket is called, will fly hundreds of times before the SLS becomes operational, making the company a bundle along the way. The buzz in the space business isn’t always about bigger rockets and farther journeys. Today, it’s about downright small rockets, practically bespoke, and designed to go just a few hundred or thousand miles. Just a little lift Entrepreneurs are excited about small satellites for the same reason you may be excited about Pokemon Go: Engineers can now cram a huge amount of processing and sensing ability into an electronics component that barely weighs anything, letting you do fun things (catch Pokemon, snap satellite pictures) very cheaply in places you could not before (sidewalks across America, low-Earth orbit). Advances like these make it possible to do more with smaller satellites, a key savings in a business where installing your infrastructure costs—at a minimum—thousands of dollars per kilogram. Numerous companies already have sprung up, among them Spire, Planet, Urthecast, Planetary Resources, and BlackSky Global, promising a brisk business for launching small satellites, which could be used for purposes ranging from photography to communications to tracking.  It’s the space equivalent of sending a UPS truck across town instead of an enormous container ship.  Instead of dozens of small satellites launched annually, analysts are now forecasting hundreds of small satellites heading to orbit each year. The next question is how to get them up there. Most of the time, small satellites are launched in groups by the big space-access providers, like Arianespace or ULA, but it’s tough finding room on one of their launches, especially when each company may fly just a dozen missions in a year. It’s also a logistical hassle. Booking a launch requires wait times that are often longer than a year, as well as customizing your satellite to the rocket you’re riding on, and often ends with your mission taking a backseat to whatever the primary cargo is. There’s no real way to conceive of a small satellite, build it, and launch it in just a few months, which makes rapid testing and deployment in the spirit of Silicon Valley nearly impossible. “We are already seeing traffic jams for a launch at the national ranges,” Virgin Galactic executive Will Pomerantz says. “You want to fly on date X, so does NASA, and so does the Air Force; you can imagine where a small entrepreneurial company would fall on the pecking order.” You can see where this is going: What if small satellites had commensurately small rockets to take them quickly into orbit, the space equivalent of sending a UPS truck across town instead of an enormous container ship? Necessity is the mother “Nobody is paying attention to those guys—they’re still treated like toys, like second-class citizens, they don’t have a reliable way to get to orbit,” Jim Cantrell says of small satellite companies.  “I’m going to dominate the small side.”  Cantrell is a founder of Vector Space, the company behind the Mojave Desert test. He and co-founder John Garvey are both veterans of the space business; they played a role in helping Elon Musk set up SpaceX when the company’s early staff was being recruited in those same Mojave test grounds. Vector Space Systems testing their prototype in the Mojave. (Vector Space) Musk’s vision for disrupting space is slightly different: SpaceX is beating established rocketry firms at the lucrative work of launching enormous satellites into orbit, especially geo-stationary orbits 37,000 kilometers up, where satellites can hang over one spot on Earth. SpaceX’s next rocket, the Falcon Heavy, will be enormous (though not quite as big as SLS) and designed to take big cargo into space very efficiently. “Geo-stationary orbit is actually real estate—you can only put so many satellites up there,” Cantrell says. “It’s like waterfront property at the beach. Everyone builds the biggest thing they can put up there. Chasing that market, putting everybody out of that business, that’s how Elon is going to fund his way to Mars. It’s kind of a brilliant strategy.” But that’s not Cantrell’s business. He and Garvey are focused on the opportunity they see in a world where companies are building businesses around satellites that weigh less than 100 lbs. “I’m going to dominate the small side,” Cantrell promises. He expects to orbital tests to start next year, and operations to commence in 2018. A crowded field Vector Space is hardly the only company to aim for this market. There at least a half-dozen hoping to be the first to provide regular service to small satellite operators. Rocket Labs, a San Francisco/New Zealand effort, has developed a new kind of electronic rocket motor and is already signing on clients to fly as soon as 2017, though it has yet to fully flight-test its rocket. Firefly also is developing a rocket, and expects by 2018 to launch satellites weighing less than 1,000 kg. Then there are the companies developing plans to launch small rockets from planes, like Paul Allen’s Vulcan Aerospace. Vulcan is in the early stages of figuring out how to use an aircraft called the Stratolaunch, with the largest wingspan ever built, for the job. And Richard Branson’s Virgin Galactic is in the process of hardware-testing a rocket system it hopes is two years away from launching satellites on a 60-foot (18-meter) rocket slung under the belly of a 747. A rendering of what it might look like to drop a rocket off a 747. (Virgin Galactic) “Even if you are only at an altitude of 35,000 feet, you’re already above 90% of the atmosphere, not swimming your way through a thick soup of atmosphere at the start of a mission,” Pomerantz says. Another answer for the smallest satellites is the company NanoRacks, which in 2014 installed a special port on the International Space Station to launch cubesats carried aloft during regular cargo delivery missions to the station, where astronauts can then deploy the satellites. So far, they have launched more than 100. There’s one big threat to the small-rocket business The incumbent rocket companies flying the big cargo missions aren’t ignoring the market trends. And they all have operational rockets in an industry where bringing a functioning product to market rarely happens on schedule. SpaceX’s obsession with reusability has it convinced it will drive competitors with smaller rockets out of business. It has also forced its competitors to think more about lowering launch costs and using every inch of their rockets efficiently. United Launch Alliance, the joint venture of Boeing and Lockheed Martin that performs most US space launches, has developed a “cubesat” carrier (designed for small, cube-shaped satellites) that can attach to its Atlas rocket; and it plans to deploy it widely. “Every Atlas launch vehicle would have one of these carriers on the back end and provide the total current equivalent of the world’s cubesat rides to space, in one to three years,” ULA CEO Tory Bruno told Quartz. “I think there is going to be greater and greater utility in smaller and smaller satellites,” Bruno added, describing a scenario in which low-Earth orbit “becomes the app store of space, [offering] all sorts of economic activities there, things we haven’t even thought about today.” Bet on the little guy If the large rocket companies think their quest for lower pricing will eventually crowd out smaller competitors, the new companies are equally bullish that the incumbents can’t match their service and flexibility in a world of cheap access to space. “In many ways, the market for satellites has been so constrained by launch costs for so long, if that diminishes, it’s going to increase our demand,” Virgin Galactic’s Pomerantz says, forecasting an expanded array of rocket needs. If cheap access to space is really going to bring about a surge of new economic activity there, it will likely take multiple, easy-to-use platforms for commercial access—because the industry will be serving a range of customers, and because individual customers will have a range of needs. A key client for Virgin, OneWeb, the space internet company, has an ambitious efforts underway to launch hundreds of satellites weighing 125 kilograms apiece to deliver broadband internet to Earth. OneWeb can launch perhaps 35 or 40 of its satellites on a large rocket, whereas Virgin Galactic could only launch two at a time. But even if most satellites are launched in bulk, small rockets can be used for a lot of other purposes—replacing individual satellites if they fail, testing new generations of satellites, or putting a few satellites in a unique orbit to eliminate empty coverage areas, for example. “We’ve designed our capability to be able to go into space for any rocket that will provide it,” says Chris Lewicki, the CEO of Planetary Resources, a company developing the technology to mine asteroids and a likely customer for the small-scale players. “In the normal shipping market, FedEx or UPS or DHL, they all have their different advantages.” And it will take that kind of ease of use to make Earth-orbit the kind of entrepreneurial playground that these starry-eyed Silicon Valley voyagers are looking for.

But, for a quieter experience, you may want to see them up close at the Hydroplane and Raceboat Museum in Kent. The exhibit grew from a private collection of memorabilia into a warehouse jampacked with hydroplanes that have been restored to sailing condition. Nine were on display when I visited, including the historic 1975 Oh Boy! Oberto, the first one to be sponsored by the local brand. Years before we had Sounders, Seahawks or Mariners to root for, hydroplane races put Seattle on the map of professional sports. I often hear these words when people talk about them: “Quintessential Seattle.” Here are more sketches from my visit to the museum: Modern-era hydroplanes use enclosed cockpits to protect the pilots in case of crashes. The cockpit of this Boeing hydro came from an F-16 aircraft. Back in the day, it was normal for towns to have their own mascot hydros. The 1960 Miss Burien was sponsored by a group of Burien merchants. The 1957 Miss Wahoo belonged to Bill Boeing Jr. With its wooden finish, it stands as the most elegant in the collection.

The latest push to speed delivery of its products comes as the company ships an increasing number of packages worldwide. Amazon's parcel volume was an estimated 1 billion packages in 2015 — the same number that FedEx delivered three years earlier for hundreds of thousands of customers. Amazon has had issues with the reliability of air freight services. In 2013, it offered refunds to customers who got their Christmas orders late after bad weather and a jump in online shopping caused delays for UPS and FedEx. Analysts say it makes sense for Amazon to use an air fleet it controls as another way to get its products to online shoppers drawn to fast, no-extra-cost delivery. "They're such a big online retailer," said Satish Jindel, president of shipping consultant ShipMatrix. "There's so much volume that if you have to add transportation for yourself, why would you pay a retail price when you can get wholesale? It makes sense." Amazon will reveal its first branded "Prime Air" cargo plane, designated Amazon One, on Friday at the annual Seafair Air Show. The plane will buzz over Seattle's Lake Washington just before the Navy's Blue Angels take to the skies, a company official said. Amazon leased 40 Boeing jets from Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings and Air Transport Services Group Inc., which will operate the air cargo network. Eleven of the planes already are delivering packages for Amazon's annual Prime loyalty program, which offers free two-day shipping and other perks. The remaining freighters will be rolled out in the next couple of years. Aircraft like Amazon One allow the company to "continue to maintain our fast delivery speeds and lower our costs as our Prime base and our Prime member growth continue to soar," said Dave Clark, Amazon's senior vice president of worldwide operations. Despite its growing fleet of aircraft, Amazon said it plans to continue to use FedEx, UPS and other transportation partners. "Because of our growth and the sheer amount of packages, we are supplementing our transportation needs," Clark said. The company has been furiously building out distribution centers, where workers and robots pull products off shelves and package them for delivery, as well as smaller sorting plants, which arrange packages by ZIP code for faster delivery. It has a network of more than 125 fulfillment centers worldwide. Amazon recently reported a second-quarter profit of $857 million on $30 billion in revenue. The company doesn't yet have plans to carry packages for others but says it's constantly evaluating its situation. Amazon has not been shy about competing in businesses areas far-flung from its e-commerce roots. "Once you have those planes, it certainly creates the opportunity for new products for customers," Clark said, adding: "Stay tuned and we'll see what happens in the future." -- The Associated Press Insurance Guide 2017 Need help with open enrollment?

In this Feb. 28, 2016 file photo, Sakinab Shah, sister of Capt. Zaharie Ahmad Shah, the senior pilot of Malaysian Flight 370 that mysteriously vanished two years ago, holds up her mobile phone with the latest picture of her brother during an interview at her house in Kuala Lumpur. Malaysia officials have confirmed for the first time that the flight path to the southern Indian Ocean was found on Shah’s simulator.  (Joshua Paul / AP)   By Eileen NgAssociated Press Fri., Aug. 5, 2016 KUALA LUMPUR, MALAYSIA—Malaysia acknowledged for the first time that one of the pilots of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 had plotted a course on his home flight simulator to the southern Indian Ocean, where the missing jet is believed to have crashed. Australian officials overseeing the search for the plane last month said data recovered from Capt. Zaharie Ahmad Shah’s simulator included a flight path to the southern Indian Ocean. Malaysian officials at the time refused to confirm the findings. On Thursday, Transport Minister Liow Tiong Lai told local journalists that the flight path was found on the simulator. He also cautioned there were “thousands” of destinations on the simulator and no evidence that Zaharie flew the plane in that area or deliberately crashed it. A recording of the news conference was made available to The Associated Press on Friday. New York Magazine reported last month that an FBI analysis of the device showed Zaharie had conducted a simulated flight to the southern Indian Ocean less than a month before the plane vanished along a similar route. The magazine cited the discovery as strong evidence that the disappearance was a premeditated act of mass murder-suicide at the hands of the captain. Article Continued Below “Until today, this theory is still under investigation. There is no evidence to prove that Captain Zaharie flew the plane into the southern Indian Ocean,” Liow said. “Yes, there is the simulator but the (route) was one of thousands to many parts of the world. We cannot just base on that to confirm (he did it).” Liow didn’t say when the Indian Ocean path was flown on the simulator. He stressed that international experts and Australian officials have agreed that the most likely scenario was “uncontrolled ditching” of the plane. The latest twist in the saga of the world’s biggest aviation mystery unnerved families of the victims, who blame Malaysia for a coverup and incompetence. “It is sheer nonsense! I don’t believe it at all. We were told in the past that both the plane and the pilots had no problem and now we are told there was something wrong with the pilot,” said Li Xinmao, whose daughter Li Yan and son-in-law Luo Wei were among the majority of Chinese passengers on the flight. “It is another irresponsible thing the Malaysian government has done to try to fool the relatives and cover up the truth and the conspiracy. We relatives strongly protest it and strongly demand the discovery of our loved ones,” he said. In Malaysia, Jacquita Gonzales, whose husband Patrick Gomes was a crew member, said there were many unanswered questions over the Indian Ocean flight path in the captain’s simulator. She said it was unclear when he last flew the route on the simulator. She also noted reports citing a private investigator that a flaperon — a small section of the wing that washed ashore on Reunion island off East Africa last year — was broken off, indicating controlled ditching of the plane. “I am not blaming the pilot, but the government should be more forthcoming with information. Why is France still not releasing details on the flaperon after so long?” she said. “It’s very frustrating. We are like yo-yo going up and down all the time.” She also said police questioned all crew families in the early days of the tragedy and had told them that all crew members were cleared. Liow said Thursday that French authorities were still waiting for documents from several parties including Boeing, and insisted on holding on to the wing part as court evidence. Australia’s Joint Agency Coordination Center — which is overseeing the search for the plane off Australia’s west coast — has also said that evidence of the route did not prove that Zaharie had planned to steer the plane off course and showed only “the possibility of planning” for such an event. Malaysia’s national police chief Khalid Abu Bakar has said investigations will not be conclusive until the black boxes — the cockpit voice recorder and a data recorder — are recovered. He did not rule out a pilot suicide. Officials have been stymied in their efforts to explain why the Boeing 777 carrying 239 people veered so far off course during a flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing on March 8, 2014. Theories have ranged from a deliberate murder-suicide plot by one of the pilots, to a hijacking, to a mechanical catastrophe. Similarly, search crews have been unable to find the main wreckage of the plane despite a sweeping underwater hunt of a remote stretch of ocean off Australia’s west coast. Last month, officials from Malaysia, Australia and China announced that the underwater search will be suspended once the current search area has been completely scoured. Crews have fewer than 10,000 square kilometres left to scan of the 120,000-square-kilometre search area, and should finish their sweep of the region by the end of the year.

Photo by Robert Cohen, rcohen@post-dispatch.com BRIDGETON • A man who killed his wife, two of their adult children and himself at home here last weekend suffered from paranoia and depression, a relative told police. Police said Thomas P. Comer, 73, committed suicide after fatally shooting his wife, Carole Comer, 71; their son John M. Comer, 50; and their daughter Rebecca Kelleher, 45. All four lived in the house in the 3600 block of Harmann Estates Court. The bodies were discovered July 30. Thomas Comer had gone to a doctor just the day before, to have his medication adjusted, according to a police report made public Friday. That information was provided to police by a daughter from Ohio, who was here for a visit and had been at the home July 29. No one answered the door or cellphones when she returned the next morning. Relatives used a crowbar to open a door and police went inside. They found a dead woman on the kitchen floor and a dead man kneeling next to a chair. Downstairs were the bodies of a man in a bed and a woman on the floor. All had been shot in the head. The report did not say which person was where. In a statement Monday, Bridgeton police said an investigation revealed that Thomas Comer was responsible. He and Carole Comer had celebrated their 50th wedding anniversary about 14 months ago. They had five children and seven grandchildren. Obituaries said Thomas Comer was “a brilliant engineer who designed aircraft for NASA, McDonnell Douglas, and Boeing,” and that Carole Comer “never complained and always remained positive during her health issues.” A longtime family friend said Carole Comer had been battling lung cancer. +3  John Comer (Photo from Baue Funeral Home website) John Comer enjoyed movies and trivia and was a member of St. Louis Family Church, his obituary said.

Thursday, November 24, 2016 News Sarawak State Election 2016 Nation Sabah World Brunei Kalimantan Business Sports Football General Tennis Badminton Utusan Borneo Berita Sarawak Berita Sabah Berita Nasional Berita Iban Sukan thesundaypost Columns BPO Seeds BAT Nation  Less than 2 months in office, Ukraine President faces first ‘international crisis’ August 6, 2016, Saturday KUALA LUMPUR: Less than two months in office, Ukrainian  President Petro Poroshenko, was tested with what has been described as ‘the biggest crime against humanity in the history of modern aviation.’ The Malaysia Airlines MH17 tragedy, where 298 lives were lost when it was shot down over eastern Ukraine, gave Poroshenko his first international crisis. “My first reaction was complete shock. I am the commander in chief of our armed forces and I know there is no Ukrainian plane, aircraft system in the area.” “Immediately, I did several important steps within a few hours after the tragedy. I called the Prime Minister of Malaysia, the Netherlands and all the nations that suffered the most,” Poroshenko told Bernama in an exclusive interview in conjunction with his three-day official visit to Malaysia beginning Wednesday. Elaborating on the government of Ukraine’s willingness to cooperate, Poroshenko said that from the beginning, his side has conveyed their openess for absolute transparent investigation to find those responsible for the disastrous attack. The country also initiated an unprecedented step when Poroshenko proposed that all nations, which suffered in the attack, should take part in the investigation. “The Netherlands, the nation that suffered the most from this terroristic attack will take responsibility (to lead the investigation) and we make this decision only upon the acceptance of all the nations involved,” he explained. After 15-month of investigation, the Dutch Safety Board (DSB) team comprising Malaysia, Ukraine, the UK, the US, Australia and Russia released a technical report last year, which concluded that the airliner was shot down by a Russian-made surface-to-air BUK missile while cruising at 33,000 ft over rebel-held eastern Ukraine. Meanwhile, the criminal aspect of the tragedy is being investigated by the Joint Investigation Team (JIT), which comprises the Netherlands, Malaysia, Belgium, Ukraine and Australia. The result is expected at the end of this year. The Boeing B777 aircraft tragedy was one of the main issues discussed during Poroshenko’s first official visit to Malaysia. Both countries also affirmed their commitment to find out the truth and bring the perpetrators to justice. Elaborating on his discussion with Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Tun Razak, the president said that both leaders would use every possible mechanisms to punish the country and person responsible for the attack, including through the International Criminal Court (ICC). “ICC is one of the possible option. We should keep the door open for every opportunity to make the person responsible be in prison including the ICC, the international tribunal and the Security Council mechanism,” said the 50-year-old president. During the meeting, Najib said that after the JIT report is published, the five countries would meet again and agree on the next course of action. Touching on recent terrorism attacks by the so called Islamic State (IS), also known as Daesh, which have become global threat, Poroshenko stressed that no specific religion should be blamed. “My position is very simple and straightforward. Terrorism has no nationality, religion, symbol or item,” he opined, while noting that effectiveness in security forces is crucial to curb such threat. Poroshenko pointed out that Ukraine has successfully stopped 300 terrorism attempts, which mostly targetted its Anti-Terrorist Operation Zone (ATO) in the Donbass region, as well as parts of Donetsk and Luhansk. — Bernama What do you think of this story?

Australian officials overseeing the search for the plane last month said data recovered from Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah’s simulator included a flight path to the southern Indian Ocean. Malaysian officials at the time refused to confirm the findings. On Thursday, Transport Minister Liow Tiong Lai told local journalists that the flight path was found on the simulator. He also cautioned there were “thousands” of destinations on the simulator and no evidence that Zaharie flew the plane in that area or deliberately crashed it. New York Magazine reported last month that an FBI analysis of the device showed Zaharie had conducted a simulated flight to the southern Indian Ocean less than a month before the plane vanished along a similar route. The magazine cited the discovery as strong evidence that the disappearance was a premeditated act of mass murder-suicide at the hands of the captain. “Until today, this theory is still under investigation. There is no evidence to prove that Captain Zaharie flew the plane into the southern Indian Ocean,” Liow said. “Yes, there is the simulator but the (route) was one of thousands to many parts of the world. We cannot just base on that to confirm (he did it).” Liow didn’t say when the Indian Ocean path was flown on the simulator. He stressed that international experts and Australian officials have agreed that the most likely scenario was “uncontrolled ditching” of the plane. The latest development in the saga of the world’s biggest aviation mystery unnerved families of the victims, who blame Malaysia for a cover-up and incompetence. “It is sheer nonsense! I don’t believe it at all. We were told in the past that both the plane and the pilots had no problem and now we are told there was something wrong with the pilot,” said Li Xinmao, whose daughter Li Yan and son-in-law Luo Wei were among the many Chinese passengers on the flight. “It is another irresponsible thing the Malaysian government has done to try to fool the relatives and cover up the truth and the conspiracy. We relatives strongly protest it and strongly demand the discovery of our loved ones,” he said. In Malaysia, Jacquita Gonzales, whose husband Patrick Gomes was a crew member, said there were many unanswered questions about the Indian Ocean flight path in the captain’s simulator. She said it was unclear when he last flew the route on the simulator. She also noted reports citing a private investigator that a flaperon — a small section of the wing that washed ashore on Reunion island off East Africa last year — was broken off, indicating controlled ditching of the plane. “I am not blaming the pilot, but the government should be more forthcoming with information. Why is France still not releasing details on the flaperon after so long?” she said. “It’s very frustrating. We are like yoyo going up and down all the time.” She also said police questioned all crew families in the early days of the tragedy and had told them that all crew members were cleared. Liow said on Thursday that French authorities were still waiting for documents from several parties including Boeing, and insisted on holding onto the wing part as court evidence. Australia’s Joint Agency Coordination Center, which is overseeing the search for the plane off Australia’s west coast, has also said that evidence of the route did not prove that Zaharie had planned to steer the plane off course and showed only “the possibility of planning” for such an event. Malaysia’s national police chief Khalid Abu Bakar has said investigations will not be conclusive until the black boxes — the cockpit voice recorder and a data recorder — are recovered. He did not rule out a pilot suicide. Malaysia has been criticized for being slow in providing information about the disappearance of the plane belonging to its national flag carrier. “There is no clear reason why the Malaysian government is doing this, but it does seem to be connected with wanting the disaster to have as little impact as possible on the standing of the airline, which is already in deep financial trouble,” said Damien Kingsbury, professor of international politics at Deakin University in Melbourne, Australia. “Having one of its pilots intentionally ditch the plane in the ocean, as this might seem to indicate, means that a question mark is placed over all of its pilots. This in turn means people will be less confident in flying with Malaysia Airlines, meaning a further downturn in its already struggling business,” Kingsbury said in an e-mail. Officials have been stymied in their efforts to explain why the Boeing 777 carrying 239 people veered so far off course during a flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing on March 8, 2014. Theories have ranged from a deliberate murder-suicide plot by one of the pilots, to a hijacking, to a mechanical catastrophe. Similarly, search crews have been unable to find the main wreckage of the plane despite a sweeping underwater hunt of a remote stretch of ocean off Australia’s west coast. Last month, officials from Malaysia, Australia and China announced that the underwater search will be suspended once the current search area has been completely scoured. Crews have fewer than 10,000 square kilometers left to scan of the 120,000-square kilometer search area, and should finish their sweep of the region by the end of the year.

We rely heavily on the company to deliver us the products we need in two days. Honestly, why go to the store anymore after a long day of work when you can buy the same item, probably cheaper, on Amazon and have it show up on your doorstep two days later?  If it’s not an urgent need, Amazon is the route many people go. Have you ever wondered, though, how they deliver these packages so quickly? It certainly seems like magic, but it’s actually thanks to cargo planes. This week Amazon unveiled its first branded “Prime Air” cargo plane, called Amazon One, which is one of 40 jetliners that will make up the e-commerce’s own air transportation network. As of now, Amazon relies on other air freight services, which don’t always get customers their products in the promised two days. It’s true that we customers can be a demanding bunch; Prime offers us an amazing two day delivery guarantee, and there’s nothing more disappointing than getting home on that second day and realizing that your package isn’t waiting for you. Amazon had a major problem with this around Christmas in 2013, and offered refunds to customers who got their orders late after bad weather and a jump in online shopping caused delays for UPS and FedEx. To avoid more of these problems, Amazon is taking transportation into their own hands. Their parcel volume was an estimated 1 billion packages in 2015, and they want to make sure that all of those packages arrive on time from now on. Their new air fleet is one of the ways in which Amazon is working to ensure that deliveries are made on time, with no extra cost to the customer. To put this plan into action, they have leased 40 Boeing jets from Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings and Air Transport Services Group Inc., which will operate the air cargo network. There are already eleven planes in use, and the rest will be put into action over the upcoming years. Aircraft like Amazon One allow the company to "continue to maintain our fast delivery speeds and lower our costs as our Prime base and our Prime member growth continue to soar," said Dave Clark, Amazon's senior vice president of worldwide operations. Between the creation of this air fleet and the building of more distribution centers around the country, Amazon is working hard to make sure their customers are kept satisfied. Despite their use of planes, though, they are still planning on using FedEx, UPS and other transportation partners as well. With all these transportation forces at work, it’s safe to say that those instances where you come home to a missing package will become far and few between. Clark seems optimistic for the future of Amazon and the unlocked potential these planes represent, saying, “Stay tuned and we’ll see what happens in the future.” Edited by Ken Briodagh Author Info Alicia Young Web Editor Click here to read full bio SHARE THIS ARTICLE Tweet Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. blog comments powered by Disqus Related Articles Making Sense of SpaceX, Boeing and Other Mega Satellite Broadband Projects By: Doug Mohney    11/22/2016 SpaceX's plan to put a whopping 4,425 satellites into low earth orbit (LEO) is the boldest plan for adding global non-terrestrial broadband capacity, … Read More The Abysmal Pace of New PC Tech By: Doug Mohney    11/22/2016 While storylines of the death of the PC have been running since the release of the iPad and the wave of tablets, it is clear that style has overtaken … Read More Five Ways Artificial Intelligence is Changing the Customer Experience By: Special Guest    11/22/2016 AI is transforming the way companies interact with customers.

As a result of the A350 XWB agreement, Spirit extended the block to 800 shipsets and recorded an additional net forward-loss of US$135.7 million in the second quarter. Operating income for the second quarter of 2016 was US$83 million, compared to US$230 million in the second quarter of 2015, reflecting the impact of the charge associated with the Airbus settlement and other one-time items. Fuselage Systems segment revenue in the second quarter of 2016 was up 3% to US$915 million, while Propulsion Systems segment revenue in the second quarter of 2016 increased 9% to US$482 million. Wing Systems revenue in the second quarter of 2016 increased 15% to US$424 million due to higher production deliveries on the A350 XWB and A320 programs and one-time claim settlements with customers, partially offset by lower net revenue recognized on certain non-recurring Boeing programs. The company expects full-year 2016 revenue to be between US$6.6 - US$6.7 billion. This story is reprinted from material from Spirit Aerosystems, with editorial changes made by Materials Today.

(Photo from Baue Funeral Home website) A Bridgeton police officer removes police tape after finishing work at an apparent murder suicide where four people died in the 3600 block of Harmann Estates Court in Bridgeton on Saturday, July 30, 2016. Photo by Robert Cohen, rcohen@post-dispatch.com BRIDGETON • A man who killed his wife, two of their adult children and himself at home here last weekend suffered from paranoia and depression, a relative told police. Police said Thomas P. Comer, 73, committed suicide after fatally shooting his wife, Carole Comer, 71; their son John M. Comer, 50; and their daughter Rebecca Kelleher, 45. All four lived in the house in the 3600 block of Harmann Estates Court. The bodies were discovered July 30. Thomas Comer had gone to a doctor just the day before, to have his medication adjusted, according to a police report made public Friday. That information was provided to police by a daughter from Ohio, who was here for a visit and had been at the home July 29. No one answered the door or cellphones when she returned the next morning. Relatives used a crowbar to open a door and police went inside. They found a dead woman on the kitchen floor and a dead man kneeling next to a chair. Downstairs were the bodies of a man in a bed and a woman on the floor. All had been shot in the head. The report did not say which person was where. In a statement Monday, Bridgeton police said an investigation revealed that Thomas Comer was responsible. He and Carole Comer had celebrated their 50th wedding anniversary about 14 months ago. They had five children and seven grandchildren. Obituaries said Thomas Comer was “a brilliant engineer who designed aircraft for NASA, McDonnell Douglas, and Boeing,” and that Carole Comer “never complained and always remained positive during her health issues.” A longtime family friend said Carole Comer had been battling lung cancer. +3  John Comer (Photo from Baue Funeral Home website) John Comer enjoyed movies and trivia and was a member of St. Louis Family Church, his obituary said.

News Airbus' A380 Demand Wanes As Qantas Doesn't Want Rest Of Order Airbus' A380s demand outlook took another hit after Qantas Airways signaled that it didn't the rest of its order for Airbus' largest plane. (Airbus) GILLIAN RICH 8/05/2016 Reprints Demand outlook for Airbus' (EADSY) A380s took another hit Friday after Australia's Qantas Airways signaled that it didn't the rest of its order for Airbus' largest plane. Qantas' Chief Executive Officer Alan Joyce said that the airline's current fleet of 12 A380s was enough to meet demand and doesn't need the other eight on order. Joyce had delayed the delivery of the last of the jets for the last two years. Virgin Atlantic has also pushed back delivery of the double-decker jumbo jets so Dubai's Emirates is the last carrier committed to the A380. Germany's Lufthansa and British Airways also fly the A380. Airbus shares closed up 0.1% to 14.06 in the stock market today. Earlier this year, Boeing (BA) cut the production rate on its 747-8 jumbo from one per month to 0.5 per month as demand from the cargo sector slows. Boeing took a charge on the program in Q2. Boeing shares rose 0.4% to 131.73. Boeing is sandwiched between support lines -- just above its 50-day moving average but below its 200-day. IBD'S TAKE: Boeing is rated a lowly 36th in IBD's Aerospace-Defense group. Lockheed Martin and some big defense contractors are highly rated, but they're not No. 1 either. Get in the cockpit of the group's real leaders at IBD Stock Checkup. Last month at the Farnborough Airshow, Airbus said it would only build 12 A380s per year, down from 30. Decreased demand in the super jumbos come as airlines around the world focus on smaller direct routes rather than shuttling passengers on larger jets to major hubs. Last month, Airbus Chief Operating Officer John Leahy said the company will still boost production of its A320 jets, single-aisle jets, to 60 a month from 42 currently.

Malaysia has confirmed one of the pilots of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 had plotted a course on his home flight simulator to the southern Indian Ocean, where the missing jet is believed to have crashed. It's the first time Malaysia has acknowledged the route was on Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah's simulator. Australian officials overseeing the search for the plane last month said data recovered from the simulator included a flight path to the southern Indian Ocean. (AP Photo/Joshua Paul, File) .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... ..........KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia — Malaysia acknowledged for the first time that one of the pilots of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 had plotted a course on his home flight simulator to the southern Indian Ocean, where the missing jet is believed to have crashed. Australian officials overseeing the search for the plane last month said data recovered from Capt. Zaharie Ahmad Shah’s simulator included a flight path to the southern Indian Ocean. Malaysian officials at the time refused to confirm the findings. On Thursday, Transport Minister Liow Tiong Lai told local journalists that the flight path was found on the simulator. He also cautioned there were “thousands” of destinations on the simulator and no evidence that Zaharie flew the plane in that area or deliberately crashed it. A recording of the news conference was made available to The Associated Press on Friday. Advertisement Continue reading New York Magazine reported last month that an FBI analysis of the device showed Zaharie had conducted a simulated flight to the southern Indian Ocean less than a month before the plane vanished along a similar route. The magazine cited the discovery as strong evidence that the disappearance was a premeditated act of mass murder-suicide at the hands of the captain. “Until today, this theory is still under investigation. There is no evidence to prove that Captain Zaharie flew the plane into the southern Indian Ocean,” Liow said. “Yes, there is the simulator but the (route) was one of thousands to many parts of the world. We cannot just base on that to confirm (he did it).” Liow didn’t say when the Indian Ocean path was flown on the simulator. He stressed that international experts and Australian officials have agreed that the most likely scenario was “uncontrolled ditching” of the plane. The latest development in the saga of the world’s biggest aviation mystery unnerved families of the victims, who blame Malaysia for a cover-up and incompetence. “It is sheer nonsense! I don’t believe it at all. We were told in the past that both the plane and the pilots had no problem and now we are told there was something wrong with the pilot,” said Li Xinmao, whose daughter Li Yan and son-in-law Luo Wei were among the many Chinese passengers on the flight. “It is another irresponsible thing the Malaysian government has done to try to fool the relatives and cover up the truth and the conspiracy. We relatives strongly protest it and strongly demand the discovery of our loved ones,” he said. In Malaysia, Jacquita Gonzales, whose husband Patrick Gomes was a crew member, said there were many unanswered questions about the Indian Ocean flight path in the captain’s simulator. She said it was unclear when he last flew the route on the simulator. She also noted reports citing a private investigator that a flaperon — a small section of the wing that washed ashore on Reunion island off East Africa last year — was broken off, indicating controlled ditching of the plane. Advertisement Continue reading “I am not blaming the pilot, but the government should be more forthcoming with information. Why is France still not releasing details on the flaperon after so long?” she said. “It’s very frustrating. We are like yoyo going up and down all the time.” She also said police questioned all crew families in the early days of the tragedy and had told them that all crew members were cleared. Liow said Thursday that French authorities were still waiting for documents from several parties including Boeing, and insisted on holding on to the wing part as court evidence. Australia’s Joint Agency Coordination Center — which is overseeing the search for the plane off Australia’s west coast — has also said that evidence of the route did not prove that Zaharie had planned to steer the plane off course and showed only “the possibility of planning” for such an event. Malaysia’s national police chief, Khalid Abu Bakar, has said investigations will not be conclusive until the black boxes — the cockpit voice recorder and a data recorder — are recovered. He did not rule out a pilot suicide. Malaysia has been criticized for being slow in providing information about the disappearance of the plane belonging to its national flag carrier. “There is no clear reason why the Malaysian government is doing this, but it does seem to be connected with wanting the disaster to have as little impact as possible on the standing of the airline, which is already in deep financial trouble,” said Damien Kingsbury, professor of international politics at Deakin University in Melbourne, Australia. “Having one of its pilots intentionally ditch the plane in the ocean, as this might seem to indicate, means that a question mark is placed over all of its pilots. This in turn means people will be less confident in flying with Malaysia Airlines, meaning a further downturn in its already struggling business,” Kingsbury said in an email. Officials have been stymied in their efforts to explain why the Boeing 777 carrying 239 people veered so far off course during a flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing on March 8, 2014. Theories have ranged from a deliberate murder-suicide plot by one of the pilots, to a hijacking, to a mechanical catastrophe. Similarly, search crews have been unable to find the main wreckage of the plane despite a sweeping underwater hunt of a remote stretch of ocean off Australia’s west coast. Last month, officials from Malaysia, Australia and China announced that the underwater search will be suspended once the current search area has been completely scoured. Crews have fewer than 10,000 square kilometers (3,861 square miles) left to scan of the 120,000-square kilometer (46,332-square mile) search area, and should finish their sweep of the region by the end of the year. ___ Associated Press writer Kristen Gelineau in Sydney and researcher Yu Bing in Beijing contributed to this report.

Painting of new jets at the plant is handled by MAAS Aviation, which also is building a facility to repaint other jets at Mobile Aeroplex at Brookley. (Tad Denson photo courtesy of Airbus Americas) Print Email Lawrence Specker | lspecker@al.com By Lawrence Specker | lspecker@al.com Press-Register Email the author | Follow on Twitter on August 05, 2016 at 8:59 AM, updated August 07, 2016 at 12:57 PM comments If you happen to have a jetliner you want to get painted, there aren't a tremendous number of places where you can get that done. But Mobile is about to be one of them – and that fact vividly illustrates the ripple effect of the city's new Airbus factory. When Airbus made the monumental decision to build its American factory in Mobile, that obviously meant new jobs for the Port City. But it also suggested that new businesses would spring up to feed that factory's need for components and services, which would mean more jobs. And beyond that, there's another ripple: New operations that might arise to serve Airbus directly, but wouldn't be here if not for Airbus. If that's abstract, a new two-bay paint shop being built at the Aeroplex by MAAS Aviation helps make it real. As does the fact that MAAS has recently announced openings in a training program to help potential employees learn the skills they'd need to work for the company. The story starts with Airbus. When it designed and built its Mobile facility, it brought in a longtime partner, MAAS Aviation, to handle the paint operation. With roots in Ireland and The Netherlands, MAAS has been painting many of Airbus' new jets for years, in Maastricht and Hamburg. In 2013, Airbus gave MAAS the contract to design, build and operate its paint shop in Mobile.   But MAAS decided to keep building. Since February, it has been erecting a separate twin-bay paint facility on the Aeroplex campus. In the process, it's adding a whole new dimension to Mobile's aerospace industry. "This is so much bigger than Airbus," said Roger Wehner, executive director of the Mobile Airport Authority. The Aeroplex already had a major tenant, VT MAE, specializing in what's called MRO work – sometimes defined as Maintenance, Repair and Operations, sometimes as Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul. Over its lifespan, any jetliner will need MRO services, and this often involves repainting, particularly if it's being sold from one owner to another, or being freshened up before being leased out to a new operator. Wehner said that while VT MAE was nearly a full-service shop, it didn't handle paint work. So if the customer wanted a jet painted, Wehner said, it had to be flown out to a separate facility for that. The flight alone would cost thousands of dollars. Now VT MAE and MAAS have jointly put out a glossy brochure pitching "End2End" service: One-stop shopping in Mobile for anyone who wants to get a jet serviced and painted. No ferry flight required. The selling points are that the logistics are simpler, the process is more efficient and the plane gets back in service more quickly. This isn't a corporate merger; Gerry Prizeman, VP of marketing and communications for MAAS, describes it as a "working partnership." That kind of talk is music to Wehner's ears. The real groundswell at the Aeroplex, he said is the result of putting a lot of "problem solvers" on one campus. "If you put a bunch of these people in one place, you become a magnet," he said. MAAS' paint shop opens in January and will have the capacity to handle 80 or 90 jets in 2017, Prizeman said. They'll be happy to paint Airbus jets, Boeing jets, any jet that'll fit. "We're in discussions with several major airline carriers in the States" about possible bookings, Prizeman said. It'll all be new business to MAAS, but it might mean new business for VT MAE as well, Prizeman said. "Airlines may not have previously considered Mobile," he said. He said the business is competitive, so MAAS can't take anything for granted. But early signs are good. "The general reaction we're getting ... is that they're happy to see some new players in the market," he said. When the new bays start operation, MAAS will need 15 to 30 new employees, he said. "Obviously that's something we're quite happy about," he said. Just as the work requires a specialized hangar, where temperature and humidity can be controlled despite Mobile's extremes, it also requires highly trained workers, he said. With the new paint bays being built, and the possibility that it will build yet another paint hanger to service Airbus in the future, MAAS recently announced a new session of its preliminary training program, starting Aug. 22. Candidates aren't required to have previous painting experience, but the program favors those with at least two years' time in automotive, commercial or industrial painting. According to information released by MAAS, the program mixes "soft skills" and technical training. "The first five weeks of the training will be offered in the evenings, followed by more extensive training that focuses on aviation best practices; aircraft familiarity; and painting application and technique. The required training is the precursor for candidates interested in entering into full-time employment with MAAS as a paint specialist." Interested candidates can e-mail usjobs@maasaviation.com. For assistance with the application process, or with creating a resume, visit the Alabama Career Center, 515 Springhill Plaza Court in Mobile, or call 251-432-0909. For many in Mobile, jobs might be the bottom line, the only part of this that really matters. But Wehner said that they can't be taken for granted: Mobile has to make the most of the opportunity it's being given, finding and facilitating possibilities such as the collaboration between VT MAE and MAAS. "We focus on interactions daily. It's all about interactions," Wehner said. "There are few places in the country that have all these pieces in one place." Airbus' role can't be downplayed. Prizeman credits the company with making a "huge decision" to build in Mobile. "When you have a really big player like Airbus come to town, you get a lot of smaller companies like ours being given opportunities to develop business alongside theirs," he said.

Why is France still not releasing details on the flaperon after so long?” she said. “It’s very frustrating.

KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia — Malaysia acknowledged for the first time that one of the pilots of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 had plotted a course on his home flight simulator to the southern Indian Ocean, where the missing jet is believed to have crashed. Australian officials overseeing the search for the plane last month said data recovered from Capt. Zaharie Ahmad Shah's simulator included a flight path to the southern Indian Ocean. Malaysian officials at the time refused to confirm the findings. On Thursday, Transport Minister Liow Tiong Lai told local journalists that the flight path was found on the simulator. He also cautioned there were “thousands” of destinations on the simulator and no evidence that Zaharie flew the plane in that area or deliberately crashed it. A recording of the news conference was made available to The Associated Press on Friday. New York Magazine reported last month that an FBI analysis of the device showed Zaharie had conducted a simulated flight to the southern Indian Ocean less than a month before the plane vanished along a similar route. The magazine cited the discovery as strong evidence that the disappearance was a premeditated act of mass murder-suicide at the hands of the captain. “Until today, this theory is still under investigation. There is no evidence to prove that Captain Zaharie flew the plane into the southern Indian Ocean,” Liow said. “Yes, there is the simulator but the (route) was one of thousands to many parts of the world. We cannot just base on that to confirm (he did it).” Liow didn't say when the Indian Ocean path was flown on the simulator. He stressed that international experts and Australian officials have agreed that the most likely scenario was “uncontrolled ditching” of the plane. The latest twist in the saga of the world's biggest aviation mystery unnerved families of the victims, who blame Malaysia for a cover-up and incompetence. “It is sheer nonsense! I don't believe it at all. We were told in the past that both the plane and the pilots had no problem and now we are told there was something wrong with the pilot,” said Li Xinmao, whose daughter Li Yan and son-in-law Luo Wei were among the majority of Chinese passengers on the flight. “It is another irresponsible thing the Malaysian government has done to try to fool the relatives and cover up the truth and the conspiracy. We relatives strongly protest it and strongly demand the discovery of our loved ones,” he said. In Malaysia, Jacquita Gonzales, whose husband Patrick Gomes was a crew member, said there were many unanswered questions over the Indian Ocean flight path in the captain's simulator. She said it was unclear when he last flew the route on the simulator. She also noted reports citing a private investigator that a flaperon — a small section of the wing that washed ashore on Reunion island off East Africa last year — was broken off, indicating controlled ditching of the plane. “I am not blaming the pilot, but the government should be more forthcoming with information.

(AP Photo/Ted S. Warren) SEATTLE—Seattle-based Amazon is unveiling its first branded cargo plane, one of 40 jetliners that will make up the e-commerce giant’s own air transportation network as it takes more control of its delivery process. The latest push to speed delivery of its products comes as the company ships an increasing number of packages worldwide. Amazon’s parcel volume was an estimated 1 billion packages in 2015 — the same number that FedEx delivered three years earlier for hundreds of thousands of customers. Amazon has had issues with the reliability of air freight services. In 2013, it offered refunds to customers who got their Christmas orders late after bad weather and a jump in online shopping caused delays for UPS and FedEx. Analysts say it makes sense for Amazon to use an air fleet it controls as another way to get its products to online shoppers drawn to fast, no-extra-cost delivery. “They’re such a big online retailer,” said Satish Jindel, president of shipping consultant ShipMatrix. “There’s so much volume that if you have to add transportation for yourself, why would you pay a retail price when you can get wholesale? It makes sense.” Amazon.com boxes are shown stacked near a Boeing 767 Amazon “Prime Air” cargo plane on display Thursday, Aug. 4, 2016, in a Boeing hangar in Seattle. (AP Photo/Ted S. Warren) On Friday afternoon the company’s first branded “Prime Air” cargo plane, designated Amazon One, will buzz over Seattle’s Lake Washington, just before the Navy’s Blue Angels take to the skies, a company official said. Amazon leased 40 Boeing jets from Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings and Air Transport Services Group Inc., which will operate the air cargo network. Eleven of the planes already are delivering packages for Amazon’s annual Prime loyalty program, which offers free two-day shipping and other perks. The remaining freighters will be rolled out in the next couple of years. Aircraft like Amazon One allow the company to “continue to maintain our fast delivery speeds and lower our costs as our Prime base and our Prime member growth continue to soar,” said Dave Clark, Amazon’s senior vice president of worldwide operations. Despite its growing fleet of aircraft, Amazon said it plans to continue to use FedEx, UPS and other transportation partners. “Because of our growth and the sheer amount of packages, we are supplementing our transportation needs,” Clark said. The company has been furiously building out distribution centers, where workers and robots pull products off shelves and package them for delivery, as well as smaller sorting plants, which arrange packages by ZIP code for faster delivery. It has a network of more than 125 fulfillment centers worldwide. Amazon recently reported a second-quarter profit of $857 million on $30 billion in revenue. The company doesn’t yet have plans to carry packages for others but says it’s constantly evaluating its situation. Amazon has not been shy about competing in businesses areas far-flung from its e-commerce roots. “Once you have those planes, it certainly creates the opportunity for new products for customers,” Clark said, adding: “Stay tuned and we’ll see what happens in the future.” Editor’s Picks China’s Growing Trade Deficit with US, Rising State and Corporate Debt: Very ‘Concerning’ Says Congressional Report What Trump’s Presidency Means for Health Care Sector Grass-Roots and Professional, Anti-Trump Protests Seek Healing and Political Change Receive Our Epoch 10 Newsletter Important stories from around the world, in your inbox daily.

FILE - In this March 6, 2016, file photo, well wishes are written on a wall of hope during a remembrance event for the ill fated Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Malaysia has confirmed one of the pilots of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 had plotted a course on his home flight simulator to the southern Indian Ocean, where the missing jet is believed to have crashed. It's the first time Malaysia has acknowledged the route was on Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah's simulator.

Malaysia's national police chief, Khalid Abu Bakar, has said investigations will not be conclusive until the black boxes — the cockpit voice recorder and a data recorder — are recovered. He did not rule out a pilot suicide. Malaysia has been criticized for being slow in providing information about the disappearance of the plane belonging to its national flag carrier. "There is no clear reason why the Malaysian government is doing this, but it does seem to be connected with wanting the disaster to have as little impact as possible on the standing of the airline, which is already in deep financial trouble," said Damien Kingsbury, professor of international politics at Deakin University in Melbourne, Australia. "Having one of its pilots intentionally ditch the plane in the ocean, as this might seem to indicate, means that a question mark is placed over all of its pilots. This in turn means people will be less confident in flying with Malaysia Airlines, meaning a further downturn in its already struggling business," Kingsbury said in an email. Officials have been stymied in their efforts to explain why the Boeing 777 carrying 239 people veered so far off course during a flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing on March 8, 2014. Theories have ranged from a deliberate murder-suicide plot by one of the pilots, to a hijacking, to a mechanical catastrophe. Similarly, search crews have been unable to find the main wreckage of the plane despite a sweeping underwater hunt of a remote stretch of ocean off Australia's west coast. Last month, officials from Malaysia, Australia and China announced that the underwater search will be suspended once the current search area has been completely scoured.

Like this story, share it with millions of investors on M3 Amazon unveils cargo plane as it expands delivery network The latest push to speed delivery of its products comes as the company ships an increasing number of packages worldwide. Post Your Comments Share Cancel Seattle-based Amazon is unveiling its first branded cargo plane, one of 40 jetliners that will make up the e-commerce giant's own air transportation network as it takes more control of its delivery process. The latest push to speed delivery of its products comes as the company ships an increasing number of packages worldwide. Amazon's parcel volume was an estimated 1 billion packages in 2015 the same number that FedEx delivered three years earlier for hundreds of thousands of customers. Amazon has had issues with the reliability of air freight services. In 2013, it offered refunds to customers who got their Christmas orders late after bad weather and a jump in online shopping caused delays for UPS and FedEx. Analysts say it makes sense for Amazon to use an air fleet it controls as another way to get its products to online shoppers drawn to fast, no-extra-cost delivery. "They're such a big online retailer," said Satish Jindel, president of shipping consultant ShipMatrix. "There's so much volume that if you have to add transportation for yourself, why would you pay a retail price when you can get wholesale? It makes sense." On Friday afternoon the company's first branded "Prime Air" cargo plane, designated Amazon One, will buzz over Seattle's Lake Washington, just before the Navy's Blue Angels take to the skies, a company official said. Amazon leased 40 Boeing jets from Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings and Air Transport Services Group Inc, which will operate the air cargo network. Eleven of the planes already are delivering packages for Amazon's annual Prime loyalty program, which offers free two-day shipping and other perks. The remaining freighters will be rolled out in the next couple of years. Aircraft like Amazon One allow the company to "continue to maintain our fast delivery speeds and lower our costs as our Prime base and our Prime member growth continue to soar," said Dave Clark, Amazon's senior vice president of worldwide operations. Despite its growing fleet of aircraft, Amazon said it plans to continue to use FedEx, UPS and other transportation partners. "Because of our growth and the sheer amount of packages, we are supplementing our transportation needs," Clark said. The company has been furiously building out distribution centers, where workers and robots pull products off shelves and package them for delivery, as well as smaller sorting plants, which arrange packages by ZIP code for faster delivery. It has a network of more than 125 fulfillment centers worldwide. Tags  Amazon cargo plane e-commerce Buy, Hold, Sell ?

By: PTI | New Delhi | Published:August 5, 2016 1:17 pm Lockheed Martin said the F 16-Block 70 will be the best fighter aircraft in the Indian region adding “it was critical” to choose “a partner who will deliver on his promise.” (Source: AP/File) American defense major Lockheed Martin on Thursday said it has offered to move its lone production line of the latest version of fighter aircraft F 16-Block 70 to India from Texas to meet Indian and global requirement. However, the company made it clear the proposal is “conditional” to IAF choosing the world’s largest-sold fighter aircraft for its fleet. “The offer we have given to the Indian government is unmatched and from our side unprecedented,” Randall L Howard, F16 Business Development head at Lockheed Martin, said in New Delhi. Interacting with mediapersons in New Delhi, Howard said the company wants to make F 16-Block 70 “for India, from India and export to the world”. However, he parried questions on whether the company is willing to give a commitment not to sell F16s to Pakistan saying it will be part of discussions between the Indian and American governments. Asked if the offer to move the production line from Fort Worth to India is conditional to IAF picking up the aircraft for its fleet, Abhay Paranjape, National Executive, India said, “Yes”. He said it is conditional to assured orders from the Indian Air Force which is looking to acquire new aircraft to beef up its depleting strength. Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar has said India will choose at least one more aircraft, besides the indigenous Tejas, for the IAF through the ‘Make in India’ route. Lockheed Martin, which has sold 4,588 F16s in the world, faces competition from its American rival Boeing (F/A-18E), Dassault Aviation of France (Rafale), Swedish plane Gripen by Saab and the Eurofighter. All the companies have offered to set up a production facility in New Delhi. “But we are offering not only moving the lone production line to India but also meeting the global requirement through the same unit here,” Howard said, adding it is a “win-win situation.” Arguing the F 16-Block 70 will be the best fighter aircraft in the Indian region, he said, “It is critical for you to pick up a partner who will deliver on his promise”. Howard said the company is having multiple discussions with the government here besides the industry and “they have not been told to go away”, indicating the discussions are on.

The company termed India as the “new epicenter of the world’s most extensive, industrial defence network”. Company sources said besides catering to India’s demand, they are also looking at a potential export order of another 100 aircraft. Lockheed officials said the US Air Force will continue to fly F16s for decades to come. They added the new avionics configuration is the largest leap in F16 combat capability and represents the most significant F16 upgrade till date. The company said current order allows the production line in the US to stay open till late 2017. If a foreign order comes through, for which talks are on with the US government, the production line will be open till 2021.

Arguing the F 16-Block 70 will be the best fighter aircraft in the Indian region, he said, "It is critical for you to pick up a partner who will deliver on his promise". Howard said the company is having multiple discussions with the government here besides the industry and "they have not been told to go away", indicating the discussions are on. He added Lockheed believes the production in India will also bring down the cost of the aircraft which in turn will increase its global demand.

Warren) A Boeing 767, an Amazon.com "Prime Air" cargo plane is parked on display Thursday, Aug. 4, 2016, in a Boeing hangar in Seattle. Amazon unveiled its first branded cargo plane Thursday, one of 40 jetliners that will make up Amazon's own air transportation network of 40 Boeing jets leased from Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings and Air Transport Services Group Inc., which will operate the air cargo network. (AP Photo/Ted S. Warren) By PHUONG LE The Associated Press SEATTLE (AP) — Seattle-based Amazon is unveiling its first branded cargo plane, one of 40 jetliners that will make up the e-commerce giant's own air transportation network as it takes more control of its delivery process. The latest push to speed delivery of its products comes as the company ships an increasing number of packages worldwide. Amazon's parcel volume was an estimated 1 billion packages in 2015 — the same number that FedEx delivered three years earlier for hundreds of thousands of customers. Amazon has had issues with the reliability of air freight services. In 2013, it offered refunds to customers who got their Christmas orders late after bad weather and a jump in online shopping caused delays for UPS and FedEx. Analysts say it makes sense for Amazon to use an air fleet it controls as another way to get its products to online shoppers drawn to fast, no-extra-cost delivery. "They're such a big online retailer," said Satish Jindel, president of shipping consultant ShipMatrix. "There's so much volume that if you have to add transportation for yourself, why would you pay a retail price when you can get wholesale? It makes sense." Amazon will reveal its branded cargo plane, Amazon One, on Friday at the annual Seafair Air Show. The plane will buzz over Seattle's Lake Washington just before the Navy's Blue Angels take to the skies, a company official said. Amazon leased 40 Boeing jets from Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings and Air Transport Services Group Inc., which will operate the air cargo network. Eleven of the planes already are delivering packages for Amazon's annual Prime loyalty program, which offers free two-day shipping and other perks. The remaining freighters will be rolled out in the next couple of years. Aircraft like Amazon One allow the company to "continue to maintain our fast delivery speeds and lower our costs as our Prime base and our Prime member growth continue to soar," said Dave Clark, Amazon's senior vice president of worldwide operations. Despite its growing fleet of aircraft, Amazon said it plans to continue to use FedEx, UPS and other transportation partners. "Because of our growth and the sheer amount of packages, we are supplementing our transportation needs," Clark said. The company has been furiously building out distribution centers, where workers and robots pull products off shelves and package them for delivery, as well as smaller sorting plants, which arrange packages by ZIP code for faster delivery. It has a network of more than 125 fulfillment centers worldwide. Amazon recently reported a second-quarter profit of $857 million on $30 billion in revenue. The company doesn't yet have plans to carry packages for others but says it's constantly evaluating its situation. Amazon has not been shy about competing in businesses areas far-flung from its e-commerce roots. "Once you have those planes, it certainly creates the opportunity for new products for customers," Clark said, adding: "Stay tuned and we'll see what happens in the future."

PTI  | Posted by Bijin Jose  Follow @PTI_News   pti@intoday.com New Delhi, August 4, 2016 | UPDATED 11:21 IST A +A - F-16 fighter jet. (Photo: PTI) Highlights 1 Lockheed Martin to move its production line of F-16 to India. 2 IAF is looking to acquire new aircraft to beef up its depleting strength. 3 Lockheed believes the production in India will also bring down the cost. American defence major Lockheed Martin today said it has offered to move its lone production line of the latest version of fighter aircraft F-16 Block 70 to India from Texas to meet Indian and global requirement. However, the company made it clear the proposal is "conditional" to IAF choosing the worlds largest-sold fighter aircraft for its fleet. "The offer we have given to the Indian government is unmatched and from our side unprecedented," Randall L Howard, F-16 Business Development head at Lockheed Martin, said here. Interacting with mediapersons here, Howard said the company wants to make F-16 Block 70 "for India, from India and export to the world". However, he parried questions on whether the company is willing to give a commitment not to sell F16s to Pakistan saying it will be part of discussions between the Indian and American governments. NEW AIRCRAFT TO BEEF UP DEPLETING STRENGTH Asked if the offer to move the production line from Fort Worth to India is conditional to IAF picking up the aircraft for its fleet, Abhay Paranjape, National Executive, India said, "Yes". He said it is conditional to assured orders from the Indian Air Force which is looking to acquire new aircraft to beef up its depleting strength. Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar has said India will choose at least one more aircraft, besides the indigenous Tejas, for the IAF through the Make in India route. Lockheed Martin, which has sold 4,588 F16s in the world, faces competition from its American rival Boeing (F/A-18E), Dassault Aviation of France (Rafale), Swedish plane Gripen by Saab and the Eurofighter. All the companies have offered to set up a production facility here. F 16-BlOCK 70 THE BEST AIRCRAFT IN THE INDIAN REGION "But we are offering not only moving the lone production line to India but also meeting the global requirement through the same unit here," Howard said, adding it is a "win-win situation". Arguing the F-16 Block 70 will be the best fighter aircraft in the Indian region, he said, "It is critical for you to pick up a partner who will deliver on his promise".

Thursday, August 4th with Expedition 48 Commander Jeff Williams and Flight Engineer Kate Rubins aboard the International Space Station. See more videos Kate Rubins was on the move Thursday, streaking around Earth in her dream job as a crew member on the International Space Station. The UC San Diego graduate is circling the big blue marble every 90 minutes, tucked inside a fragile outpost where the distinguished microbiologist devotes much of her time to scientific research. The 37 year-old Rubins also is preparing for her first spacewalk, which is scheduled for August 19. She will help Commander Jeff Williams attach a vehicle adapter to the front of space station. Rubin and Williams took a brief break on Thursday to discuss their lives and work during a ground-to-space station interview with the Union-Tribune. The conversation has been edited for space and clarity. U-T: Dr. Rubins you spent some time this week doing heart research. What were you focusing on? Rubins: Yes. This is actually a great capability for the space station. We’re checking out the ability to grow heart cells. One of the reasons we’re doing that is that while we are in space we have an upward shift of our fluids. Without gravity, it doesn’t drain down into your legs. This puts some unique stresses on your heart and the cardiovascular system. We are hoping that by culturing some of these cardiomyocytes on board, we can actually learn more about how heart cells organize, how they beat in orbit, their function, and their molecular readout. These cells are going to be sent back down to the ground on the SpaceX 9 vehicle and scientists on the ground can analyze them.

Rubins: Yeah, we sure are. This is one of the fascinating things about the space station. It drives this research in a remote environment. So we actually have a team of folks on the ground who’ve developed some really fantastic techniques for guiding us using ultrasound on board. We’re not ultrasound specialists. We learn a little bit in training. But we can use a remote guider and ultrasound our own hearts. We can look at the valves, we can look at the stroke volume, a whole bunch of different things, from the ground. This actually has a lot of use for the developing world, for remote medicine. Any time you can’t get the patient and the doctor together in the same room, you can use things like ultrasound and satellite networks to communicate medical information. U-T: Were you looking at the heart cells through a microscope? Rubins: Yes, I sure was. It was a great day on space station to put out a microscope and look through the lens for the first time. U-T: I was wondering whether the experience of looking through a microscope in microgravity is different than it is on Earth. Rubins: You know, I think folks were thinking about that a little bit because we had some discussions about how to tack it down, if it was going to move around a lot. Actually, as soon as I put my eyes on the eyepieces I felt like I was in a lab back on Earth doing my standard cell culture techniques ... we can observe all of these interesting phenomena that happen in microgravity. U-T: I read that you were going to become the first astronaut to do DNA sequencing in space? Is that correct? And have you done it yet? Rubins: So we haven’t done that yet. I think there’s a lot of talk about me being the first astronaut to do it. But, really, it’s the first ground team to do it. Those are the guys who have done all of the hard work. There’s a lot of folks at (Johnson Space Center), NASA Ames, at one of the companies we’re working with have, (who) put together all of the technology development to do sequencing on board. It’s a tech-demo, it’s proof-of-principle. We’re going to find out if this works in space. We’re going to try to understand how we can do the DNA sequencing and systems biology -- modern molecular biology -- while orbiting the Earth. U-T: Is that an Illumina (sequencing machine from San Diego?) Rubins: The technology that’s been developed for the space station is actually an Oxford Nanopore. It needs to be small and portable and remote, and there’s a lot of folks out there that are looking at a whole fleet of different technologies. Anything that’s a microfluidics chip would probably work really well up here.

(NASA) U-T: You’ve had a great deal of experience studying viruses. Have you been doing any virus research on station? Rubins: We actually have a great amount of microbiology research up here which includes viruses and all bacterial organisms -- yeast, fungi. We have some individual experiments; we’ll look in cannisters that the astronauts can activate. We’re also studying the station as a whole. We’re trying to understand the microbiological environment of space station -- bacteria, viruses. We normally carry bacteria with us all the time. We would expect that there is a lot of bacteria up here. It’s not a sterile environment. It’s a very nice and clean environment. Jeff and I try to keep it ship-shape along with our crewmate Takuya Onishi, along with our Russian cosmonauts. But there are some interesting places to take a look at the microbiome of the space station. U-T: A reader wanted to know whether your sleep has been disrupted by being in space. Some astronauts have had trouble with sleep. Rubins: Sleep is great up here. It’s actually a really nice resting state. After you exercise it takes less time for your muscles to recover. We look a little bit like zombies when we’re sleeping. But I think it’s quite restful up here. U-T: You and Commander Williams are scheduled to do a space walk on August 19th. What is the purpose of the walk? Williams: We have a couple of tasks. But the primary one is to install the first international docking adapter on the very front end of the space station to (create an) interface for the future crewed commercial vehicles currently being developed by SpaceX and Boeing. Hopefully (they’ll be) flying here within the next couple-three years to deliver crews to the International Space Station from U.S. soil. U-T: Commander Williams you have a great deal of experience doing space walks. What kind of advice have you been passing on to Dr. Rubins for what will be her first spacewalk? Williams: Well, I’m very confident in Kate. She’s going to do well out there. But we are talking about the actual conditions of going outside and doing a space walk and moving large masses, (which) include yourself. The suit is several hundred pounds added to your body weight. That’s a lot of mass to manage. We’re going to be reheasring the details over and over until the day of the spacewalk. U-T: Will the confines of your helmet make it difficult to see beyond what you’re immediately doing? Williams: Depends upon where you’re facing. If your head is full of space station and you’re buried in a work site then you don’t see much other than that. But often times when you’re translating around the outside of the space station and you get a free moment you turn around and look out into deep space or look at the entire globe of the Earth. Those are some really memorable moments that I’m sure both of us will have in this upcoming space walk. U-T: Dr. Rubins you have a lot of experience as a scuba diver. How different is the sensation of moving in microgravity from moving in water? Rubins: That’s a great question. One of the things I’ve been thinking about a lot ever since I’ve been up here is how similar the space station is to our training in the neutral buoyany laboratory at NASA. So we have what’s esentially a very large swimming pool with a lot of the parts of the space station structure under water, and we spend hundreds of hours training in the space suits. A lot of those lessons that we learned in our training really apply inside the space station as well as, I think, on space walks. U-T: When (we) spoke last October you said that you would be able to see La Jolla from space station and that you hoped to photograph it. Has that come to pass? Rubins: We got a great California pass when I first arrived here. We could see up through Oregon, into Washington. So I got a great series of photographs of California. I’ve been looking on the map and trying to see when we’re exactly over La Jolla. That might be quite a few months yet. But I will make sure that I get some good photos for you. U-T: What is the most interesting thing that you have seen through the lens of a camera up there? Rubins: That is a really hard question. I think basically every time you look through the lens there is something completely fascinating. It just takes your breath away every time. U-T: I wanted to close by noting that your alma mater, UC San Diego, will have (almost) 6,000 freshmen this fall. Do you have a message for young people like this who are trying to find what they want to do in life? Rubins: I think young folks have a good sense of what they want to do. If you really ask: What drives you? What’s your passion? What’s your motivation --that’s usually in there some where. I think my message is to pay attention to that. Folks should find what really inspires them, they should always pursue what they want to do. Young people can accomplish a lot. The students at UC San Diego have their whole future in front of them and I’m excited for them to get started on their freshmen year.

It’s Seafair Weekend, Seattle’s annual celebration of speed and noise. Meanwhile, in this edition of Xconomy Seattle’s Week in Review, we’re reading a new report on U.S. venture investing trends over the last six years, which ranks Seattle as the sixth largest VC ecosystem in the country; following fresh funding for Glowforge and a healthcare technology startup called 98point6; and checking out Envelop VR’s beta launch. Also, Seattle is a top place to spot rare Pokémon. City boosters, make a note of it. —Since 2010, West Coast tech hubs have seen more than half of the $346.5 billion of total U.S. venture capital investment in that time, according to a new report from Seattle-based PitchBook. That’s not especially surprising, given that the West Coast includes Silicon Valley, the center of the VC and tech universe. Indeed, companies based in the metropolitan statistical areas including San Francisco, Oakland, Fremont, San Jose, Sunnyvale, and Santa Clara received $144.7 billion during the last six years, or about 42 percent of the U.S. total. The report, which looks at activity through June 30 of this year, ranks the Seattle MSA, which includes Tacoma, Bellevue, and other burgs in the Puget Sound region, as the sixth largest VC ecosystem in the country. Since 2010, VCs have done some 1,717 deals, investing $8.5 billion, or about 2.5 percent of the U.S. total, as calculated by PitchBook. About a quarter of Seattle’s six-year total, $2.1 billion, was invested in 2015 across 352 deals. PitchBook’s numbers suggest this may have been a high-water mark: “[F]irst venture financings are on pace to hit just 47 percent of last year’s volume, signaling that innovation in the VC ecosystem may be stalling,” the company says. “Exit activity is also stagnating. 2015 saw a 28 percent dip in terms of the number of exits and a 71 percent drop in terms of total exit value.” PitchBook’s Seattle MSA snapshot lists zero unicorns—private companies with billion-dollar-plus valuations. (That was before this week’s report in the Wall Street Journal that OfferUp is raising $120 million in additional funding at a $1.2 billion valuation.) —While software has been and remains the hottest sector in Seattle for startups, there were a significant number of investments made in healthcare services, suppliers, and systems companies. The healthcare IT industry here saw another new investment this week with an $11 million funding round for 98point6, disclosed in an SEC filing. The company, founded in 2015 under the name Rafa Inc., is saying very little about its aims. But there are clues in its job listings. One states, “Our goal is simple—we’re seeking to revolutionize primary care by applying leading-edge data science to greatly reduce its cost. … As one of our physicians, you will deliver direct patient care through technology.” In addition to physicians, the company is hiring a squad of software engineers. The team behind 98point6 includes co-founder and CEO Robbie Cape, whose last startup, Cozi, a family organization service, was acquired by Time Inc., in 2014, and prior to that worked at Microsoft for 12 years. The company also lists an impressive medical advisory board, drawn from top institutions around the country. Seattle has a strong case to make as a hub for re-inventing the primary care model, particularly through the application of big data and machine learning. The University of Washington School of Medicine is perennially ranked as the top educator of primary care physicians. It recently launched an effort to drive innovation in the delivery of primary care. In 2015, UW Medicine, the UW’s healthcare system, began using another Seattle-area company, Carena, to provide online virtual clinic visits. —Seattle startup Glowforge raised $22 million from Foundry Group and True Ventures to add staff and inventory beyond the thousands of laser cutters and engravers it’s already manufacturing for thousands of people who pre-ordered one last fall. Apparently Foundry Group, the Colorado-based VC firm co-founded by Brad Feld, has got the laser bug this week. “We just led a $35 million financing at Formlabs. In case you were wondering, lasers are super cool,” Feld wrote in a blog post on the investment in the Somerville, MA-based desktop 3D printing company. Xconomy covered it here. —Envelop VR, the Bellevue, WA-based startup making software to bring the Windows computing environment into virtual reality, is launching its public beta product today. The software, which creates a customizable, immersive computing environment—think of a virtual office on a mountaintop or in a penthouse, with screens surrounding the user—works with the HTC Vive and Oculus Rift headsets. The company says it enables all Windows applications to work in VR. It’s also working on a software development kit to allow legacy apps to be presented in VR environments. Here’s a story I wrote last year after trying out an early version. The beta is free to download from Steam. Envelop VR for Windows concept art. Courtesy of Envelop VR —Bellevue College is turning over part of its computer programming curriculum to Coding Dojo. The deal is a way for the coding school to expand its offerings, and allows the college in Bellevue, WA, to keep its programming courses up to date. Lots more details in this story from Xconomy’s Bernadette Tansey. —Matt Oppenheimer, CEO of Seattle-based mobile remittances company Remitly, said Donald Trump’s proposal to compel Mexico to pay for a border wall by cutting off wire-transfers by people who couldn’t prove their lawful residency in the U.S. “is preposterous, impractical, and would have detrimental effects on the United States economies and those in the receiving countries.” Oppenheimer, who made those comments in an e-mail to Xconomy, also spoke at an event unveiling a new report (PDF) on the impact of immigrants on Washington’s economy. —A new aerial entry in this year’s Seafair is one of Amazon’s “Prime Air” cargo jets. As The Seattle Times’ Dominic Gates reports, the Boeing 767-300, part of the fleet of 11 used freight planes the e-commerce giant is leasing, will fly just before the Blue Angels on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. —Come catch your rare Pokémon in Seattle. Budget travel site Wanderu says Seattle trails only Los Angeles among U.S. cities with the most sightings of the rarest Pokémon. SayWA? That should really be a highlight of the next Metronatural Seattle tourism marketing campaign. (Apologies for this romp through circa-2006 promotional slogans. #neverforget) Wanderu’s methodology involved reviewing “photos and videos from 250 cities in the U.S. to find the home of epic, mythical and special Pokémon. We used the Twitter API to count the total number of sightings and look at the diversity of species found in each city.” Benjamin Romano is editor of Xconomy Seattle.

Sa’ar Koursh, the CEO of Magal Security Systems, told Bloomberg News that he would be happy to help Trump. “We would join forces with a major U.S. defense company that has experience with such projects worldwide,” he said. “We’ve done it in the past and we would definitely want to do it.” For Magal, border-wall building is a lucrative enterprise. It has installed perimeter detection systems between the Gaza Strip and Israel, and has deployed its surveillance and intrusion detection systems in the occupied West Bank. It is also active in securing West African prisons, international sporting events, and is currently bidding for a contract to export its so-called “smart fencing” — a specialized border fence that self-triggers an alarm if anyone touches it — to the Kenya-Somalia border. The Israeli security industry is no stranger to the U.S.-Mexico border. The American subsidiary of Israel’s Elbit Systems has been contracted by the Department of Homeland Security to build surveillance towers along the border. Trump has himself cited the Israeli model in the past. “If you think walls don’t work, all you have to do is ask Israel,” he said during a November primary debate. So we did. In a Skype interview with The Intercept, Hagai Katz, who handles communications for Magal, insisted that the CEO’s comments should not be read as an endorsement of Trump, emphasizing that his company would take part in securing the border under any administration. Katz explained that he thinks the U.S-Mexico border could “absolutely” be secured, with undocumented immigration reduced to near-zero levels. Katz cited the network of fences, walls, and electronic surveillance that Israel erected along its southern border to stop illegal immigration from Egypt. Over Skype, he shared figures showing a large drop in immigration after Israel erected large fences: Katz, however, cautioned against the idea of building a literal wall across every section of the border. That level of border protection is only effective in populated areas along the border, he said. “If you’re in an open spaces, which is more like a desert in a way, not a lot of vegetation, and no nearby cities, then you know putting a fence for thousands of kilometers or miles it just doesn’t make sense,” he warned. He shared a video from The Guardian of suspected drug smugglers easily scaling a barrier currently erected in Nogales, Arizona. There were no police or military units around to detect or intercept them, so a wall provided little deterrent. For those areas, he instead suggested observation towers, smart fencing, cameras, and other surveillance equipment where migrants could be detected before they reach the border and intercepted with security forces. A company slide he shared with me demonstrated this multi-pronged approach: Another slide showed an electronic border fence in Slovakia, where the country used electronic poles and underground fencing to detect crossers and alert authorities: I asked Katz who Slovakia is stopping with these devices. “Illegal immigrants,” he replied. The U.S. government is hardly unfamiliar with these techniques. Many, if not all, are already in use in some capacity. But a massive, fairly recent effort to use them to patrol more of the border and prevent unauthorized entry resulted in an epic waste of money. In 2005, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) started the Secure Border Initiative (SBI), aiming to expand the use of fencing and virtual detection to block undocumented immigration. A multi-billion contract with Boeing called for a system called SBINet to control a network of cameras and sensors intended to identify unauthorized entry and alert authorities. During initial tests, the system was repeatedly triggered in error by things like rain. A 2010 Government Accountability Office report noted that “since March 2008, the number of new SBInet defects has increased faster than the number of defects that have been fixed, which is not a trend that is indicative of a maturing system.” Finally, in 2011, after a billion dollars had already been spent, DHS axed the program altogether.

Picture: AP/Joshua Paul, 14:20 Friday 05 August 2016 2 Have your say Malaysia acknowledged for the first time that one of the pilots of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 had plotted a course on his home flight simulator to the southern Indian Ocean, where the missing jet is believed to have crashed. Australian officials overseeing the search for the plane last month said data recovered from Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah’s simulator included a flight path to the southern Indian Ocean. Malaysian officials at the time refused to confirm the findings. Transport Minister Liow Tiong Lai said that the flight path was found on the simulator. He also cautioned there were “thousands” of destinations on the simulator and no evidence that Zaharie flew the plane in that area or deliberately crashed it. New York Magazine reported last month that an FBI analysis of the device showed Zaharie had conducted a simulated flight to the southern Indian Ocean less than a month before the plane vanished along a similar route. The magazine cited the discovery as strong evidence that the disappearance was a premeditated act of mass murder-suicide at the hands of the captain. “Until today, this theory is still under investigation. There is no evidence to prove that Captain Zaharie flew the plane into the southern Indian Ocean,” Liow said. “Yes, there is the simulator but the (route) was one of thousands to many parts of the world. We cannot just base on that to confirm (he did it).” Liow did not say when the Indian Ocean path was flown on the simulator. He stressed that international experts and Australian officials have agreed that the most likely scenario was “uncontrolled ditching” of the plane. The latest development in the saga of the world’s biggest aviation mystery unnerved families of the victims, who blame Malaysia for a cover-up and incompetence. “It is sheer nonsense! I don’t believe it at all. We were told in the past that both the plane and the pilots had no problem and now we are told there was something wrong with the pilot,” said Li Xinmao, whose daughter Li Yan and son-in-law Luo Wei were among the many Chinese passengers on the flight. “It is another irresponsible thing the Malaysian government has done to try to fool the relatives and cover up the truth and the conspiracy. We relatives strongly protest it and strongly demand the discovery of our loved ones,” he said. In Malaysia, Jacquita Gonzales, whose husband Patrick Gomes was a crew member, said there were many unanswered questions about the Indian Ocean flight path in the captain’s simulator. She said it was unclear when he last flew the route on the simulator. She also noted reports citing a private investigator that a flaperon - a small section of the wing that washed ashore on Reunion island off East Africa last year - was broken off, indicating controlled ditching of the plane. “I am not blaming the pilot, but the government should be more forthcoming with information. Why is France still not releasing details on the flaperon after so long?” she said. “It’s very frustrating. We are like yoyo going up and down all the time.” She also said police questioned all crew families in the early days of the tragedy and had told them that all crew members were cleared. Liow said that French authorities were still waiting for documents from several parties including Boeing, and insisted on holding on to the wing part as court evidence. Australia’s Joint Agency Coordination Centre - which is overseeing the search for the plane off Australia’s west coast - has also said that evidence of the route did not prove that Zaharie had planned to steer the plane off course and showed only “the possibility of planning” for such an event. Malaysia’s national police chief, Khalid Abu Bakar, has said investigations will not be conclusive until the black boxes - the cockpit voice recorder and a data recorder - are recovered. He did not rule out a pilot suicide.
