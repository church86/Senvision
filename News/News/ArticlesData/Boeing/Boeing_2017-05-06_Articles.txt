(Reuters) PARIS: Airbus sold 25 passenger jets in April, bringing total orders for the European company so far this year to 51, well behind its US rival Boeing. Figures published on Friday underscore fragile demand as airlines digest record new capacity ordered in recent years while bracing for economic weakness in key markets. Airbus said that after adjustments for cancelations and conversions between different models, net orders stood at 23 aircraft for the year so far. April’s new business included 10 of its new A350-900 aircraft, but the customer was not identified. Boeing this week posted 241 orders for the first four months or 210 after cancelations. Orders were boosted partly by demand for military derivatives. Airbus delivered 182 aircraft between January and April. Airbus is targeting 700 deliveries for the whole year, though top executives have also issued a more optimistic forecast of 720 deliveries. Boeing is targeting 760-765 deliveries. Airbus expects deliveries once again to be weighted toward the latter half of the year as it faces problems with one brand of engine on its A320neo family, but hopes to avoid the dramatic sprint of December last year following such difficulties. Deliveries so far this year include 36 A320neo-family aircraft including the first A320neo. It is aiming to deliver about 200 of the upgraded medium-haul models this year. It delivered 17 A350 aircraft in the first four months. It delivered no A380 superjumbos in April and has handed over three of the aircraft for the year so far.

Under overcast skies, the white, green and blue aircraft, with "C919" emblazoned on its tail, touched down at Shanghai's international airport after an 80-minute flight to cheers from thousands of dignitaries, aviation workers and enthusiasts. The jet is a symbol of China's ambitions to muscle into a global jet market estimated to be worth $2 trillion over the next two decades, as well as of Beijing's broader "Made in China 2025" plan to spur home-made products, from medicines to robots. "Seeing the C919 take off into the sky made me quite emotional. This is a moment we have waited to see for a very long time," Wang Mingfeng, 42, who witnessed the maiden flight at the Shanghai airport, told Reuters. "I believe that in the not too distant future, we will be neck-and-neck with Boeing and Airbus." At the moment, though, Boeing <BA.N> and Airbus <AIR.PA> remain far ahead in terms of sales, technical know-how and order books. And the C919, whose test flight was pushed back at least twice since 2014 due to production issues, may need years of tests to get certified in China, as well as in the United States and Europe. On Friday, the C919 flew north over the Yangtze River delta, carried out maneuvers and then returned south along the coast before landing, according to aircraft tracker Flightradar24. State media said the plane flew at around 3,000 meters and at speeds of 290-300 kilometers (180-186 miles) per hour. The crew of five pilots and engineers, all wearing orange jump suits and aviators, were applauded as they disembarked. The plane, which can carry 158-168 passengers, had no passenger seats installed for the maiden flight. A letter from China's ministerial cabinet, read out after the plane landed, said the successful flight marked a "major breakthrough" and milestone for China's passenger jet industry. The industry ministry said in a statement the flight went smoothly and that all the systems functioned properly. The C919, made by state-owned Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC) [CMAFC.UL], relies on overseas technology from firms including General Electric <GE.N>, France's Safran <SAF.PA>, Honeywell International Inc <HON.N> and United Technologies Corp <UTX.N> subsidiary UTC Aerospace Systems. China Eastern Airlines <600115.SS> is the launch customer for the plane, which COMAC says has 570 orders from 23 customers. HARDSHIP, STRUGGLE Conceived in 2008, China wants the C919 to eventually take market share from Boeing and Airbus in the lucrative narrow-body market which accounts for more than 50 percent of the aircraft in service worldwide. For a TIMELINE on the C919, click "Every year we spend billions on buying planes," a COMAC promotional video showed President Xi Jinping saying during a site visit. He added China should become more self-reliant. However, the jet likely faces a lengthy journey from first flight to commercial usage. China's first home-made jet, the regional ARJ-21, received its type certification in December 2014, six years after its first flight and more than 12 years after it was conceived. It made its maiden passenger flight in June last year. Then there is also the daunting task of selling the jet in a global market dominated by Boeing and Airbus. "Aviation is a complex market and you need experience over a long time. Boeing has 100 years, Airbus has over 40 years," said Sinolink Securities analyst Si Jingzhe, adding COMAC still lagged far behind in terms of supply chain know-how. China is aware the path won't be easy. On a media visit on Thursday to COMAC's C919 assembly plant less than 10 kilometers from the airport, large red banners could be seen in giant hangars calling for long-term "hardship", "dedication" and "struggle" to meet the firm's goals. China is pushing for recognition globally of its certification by European and U.S. regulators as without their certification, it would only be able to sell the jet to a handful of countries that accept its certification standards. But Beijing is already looking beyond the C919, with plans to develop a wide-body long-haul jet with Russia. In November COMAC and its partner United Aircraft Corp said they have started the hunt to find suppliers.

American Airlines just deferred its order for 22 Airbus A350s for the second time in less than a year. Is there still a place in its fleet for the A350? Adam Levine-Weinberg (TMFGemHunter) May 6, 2017 at 9:50AM American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) is one of Airbus' (NASDAQOTH:EADSY) top customers. However, its commitment to one of Airbus' key models seems to be wavering. Less than a year ago, American Airlines deferred its order for 22 A350 widebodies. The largest U.S. airline had originally planned to take delivery of 14 A350s in the 2017-2018 period. This deferral pushed back its first two deliveries to late 2018, with the rest scheduled to arrive between 2019 and 2022. American Airlines has deferred its Airbus A350 orders again. Image source: Airbus. Late last month, American Airlines announced that it had deferred its entire A350 order by another two years. While the company still claims that it will eventually add the A350 to its fleet, it's not clear that it will ever make sense for American to go through with the order. Reducing capital expenditures For the past few years, American Airlines has spent heavily to modernize its fleet. But in the past year or so, as its profitability has come under pressure, the company has started to focus more on keeping capex in check. (American has also needed to reduce its international growth in light of challenging market conditions.) Holding down capex will be particularly important in the next few years, as American Airlines has scheduled debt maturities totaling $12 billion between 2018 and 2021. According to American Airlines CFO Derek Kerr, last year's A350 deferral reduced the company's capex by roughly $500 million in 2017 and $700 million in 2018. The more recent deferral will save another $500 million in 2018 and $300 million each in 2019 and 2020. Does American Airlines need more widebodies? Even after the most recent deferral, it's not clear that American Airlines will need the A350s when they are scheduled to arrive. Thanks to its recent fleet modernization program, the carrier doesn't have many planes left that need to be retired in the near term. American Airlines has a relatively young aircraft fleet today. Image source: American Airlines. The Airbus A350 could be a good replacement for American's fleet of 47 Boeing (NYSE:BA) 777-200ERs. However, those planes are just 16 years old, on average. Furthermore, the Boeing 777 is an exceptionally reliable model, and American is in the midst of refurbishing this fleet to add seats to each plane (and thus reduce unit costs). All in all, these planes probably still have a decade of life left. Alternatively, American Airlines may plan to use its A350s for growth rather than replacement. But future long-haul growth is contingent on a better supply-demand balance in international markets. If international routes remain flooded with excess capacity a couple of years from now, American might just kick the can further down the road by deferring the A350s again. The A350-900 has a lot of overlap with Boeing's widebodies Another issue that American Airlines must consider is the overlap between the A350 and its Boeing 777 and Boeing 787 fleets. While American has deferred its A350 deliveries twice in the past year, it has kept its order for Boeing's 787 Dreamliner more or less intact. By early 2019, it will have 42 Dreamliners in its fleet. Given that American Airlines operates lots of 777s and 787s, it doesn't necessarily need to fly the A350 as well. The 777s and 787s are suited to the same types of long-haul markets as the A350. By contrast, most of American's international flights are about 3,500-4,500 miles in length, such as flights from Miami to South America or from the Northeast to Europe. American Airlines might be better off converting its A350 order to the cheaper A330neo, which has plenty of range and competitive unit costs for routes of this length. This would further reduce its future capex commitments. Airbus can afford the loss It wouldn't necessarily be bad for Airbus if American Airlines chooses to convert its A350 order to the A330neo. The A350 has a long backlog, with more than 700 unfilled orders. And while Airbus only received three A350 orders during the first quarter, it recently bagged an order for 20 A350-900s from China Southern Airlines, indicating that demand remains healthy. By contrast, Airbus has just over 200 A330neo orders, and many of those are scheduled for far in the future. In short, Airbus has much more of a need to sell A330neos than A350s. As a result, both sides could benefit from making a deal to swap American's endlessly deferred A350 orders for A330neos. Adam Levine-Weinberg owns shares of Boeing.

The world's second-largest economy hopes it will be an apt challenger to the Boeing 737 and Airbus A320. The C919 was developed by the state-run Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (Comac), a project that started in 2008. The company said that there is a two-trillion-dollar market for the new plane, which was first unveiled in November 2016. Comac also said that a total of 23 foreign and domestic customers have placed orders for 570 C919 planes, according to RT.

The plane can carry up to 158 passengers and has a range of 4,075 kilometers. A longer-range version can fly up to 5,555 kilometers, RT reported. The Russian online newspaper Vzglyad, in turn, drew attention to the fact that the C919's engines were designed by the US-French joint venture CFM International.

Nevertheless, the creation of the narrow-bodied C919 jet from scratch represents China's first major step towards thwarting the global duopoly of Boeing and Airbus, according to Vzglyad. "Currently, only Airbus and Boeing — two commercially successful aircraft families — manufacture narrow-bodied passenger planes.  Each family has airplanes with both old and new engines, which have the highest performance in terms of economic efficiency," Vzglyad quoted Russian aviation expert Oleg Panteleyev as saying.

Meanwhile, Airbus experts say that the world market demand for narrow-bodied planes will total at 24,000 by 2035, while Boeing specialists believe that the figure will amount to 28,000. "Therefore, place for a third and fourth player formally exists [when it comes to the production of narrow-bodied planes].   The next few years may see the emergence of new airlines which can choose to use Chinese or Russian narrow-bodied aircraft," Panteleyev said, referring to Russia's MC-21, which is expected to compete with the C919. He added that in order "to enter this monopolized market, one must have both a really high-quality product and powerful financial leverage."

"Obviously, China has such a financial mechanism because Beijing can afford to finance deals on very attractive terms. Besides, the cost of the C919 will not be very expensive," he said. © Flickr/ Times Asi After J-20: How China Plans to Become Aviation SuperpowerAt the same time, Panteleyev warned that China has yet "to demonstrate complete coincidence of the declared characteristics [of the C919] and to complete its certification according to local and international standards." He said that China should focus on creating domestically-made engines and avionics if wants to become a major world aviation power. "China will certainly not cope with these two tasks by the end of this decade, but by the end of the next decade the country will certainly resolve them. If you are persistently engaged in a project with virtually limitless resources, you will achieve the result sooner or later," Panteleyev concluded.

The home-grown C919 passenger jet is a symbol of China's ambitions to muscle into a global jet market.China's home-grown C919 passenger jet takes its maiden flight. SHANGHAI: China's home-grown C919 passenger jet completed its long-delayed maiden flight on Friday, a major first step for Beijing as it looks to raise its profile in the global aviation market and boost high-tech manufacturing at home. Under overcast skies, the white, green and blue aircraft, with "C919" emblazoned on its tail, touched down at Shanghai's international airport after an 80-minute flight to cheers from thousands of dignitaries, aviation workers and enthusiasts. The jet is a symbol of China's ambitions to muscle into a global jet market estimated to be worth $2 trillion over the next two decades, as well as of Beijing's broader "Made in China 2025" plan to spur home-made products, from medicines to robots. "Seeing the C919 take off into the sky made me quite emotional. This is a moment we have waited to see for a very long time," Wang Mingfeng, 42, who witnessed the maiden flight at the Shanghai airport, told Reuters. "I believe that in the not too distant future, we will be neck-and-neck with Boeing and Airbus." At the moment, though, Boeing and Airbus remain far ahead in terms of sales, technical know-how and order books. And the C919, whose test flight was pushed back at least twice since 2014 due to production issues, may need years of tests to get certified in China, as well as in the United States and Europe. On Friday, the C919 flew north over the Yangtze River delta, carried out manoeuvres and then returned south along the coast before landing, according to aircraft tracker Flightradar24. State media said the plane flew at around 3,000 metres and at speeds of 290-300 kilometres (180-186 miles) per hour. The crew of five pilots and engineers, all wearing orange jump suits and aviators, were applauded as they disembarked. The plane, which can carry 158-168 passengers, had no passenger seats installed for the maiden flight. A letter from China's ministerial cabinet, read out after the plane landed, said the successful flight marked a "major breakthrough" and milestone for China's passenger jet industry. The industry ministry said in a statement the flight went smoothly and that all the systems functioned properly. The C919, made by state-owned Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC), relies on overseas technology from firms including General Electric, France's Safran, Honeywell International Inc and United Technologies Corp subsidiary UTC Aerospace Systems. China Eastern Airlines is the launch customer for the plane, which COMAC says has 570 orders from 23 customers. Hardship, struggle Conceived in 2008, China wants the C919 to eventually take market share from Boeing and Airbus in the lucrative narrow-body market which accounts for more than 50 percent of the aircraft in service worldwide. For a TIMELINE on the C919, click "Every year we spend billions on buying planes," a COMAC promotional video showed President Xi Jinping saying during a site visit. He added China should become more self-reliant. However, the jet likely faces a lengthy journey from first flight to commercial usage. China's first home-made jet, the regional ARJ-21, received its type certification in December 2014, six years after its first flight and more than 12 years after it was conceived. It made its maiden passenger flight in June last year. Then there is also the daunting task of selling the jet in a global market dominated by Boeing and Airbus. "Aviation is a complex market and you need experience over a long time. Boeing has 100 years, Airbus has over 40 years," said Sinolink Securities analyst Si Jingzhe, adding COMAC still lagged far behind in terms of supply chain know-how. China is aware the path won't be easy. On a media visit on Thursday to COMAC's C919 assembly plant less than 10 kilometres from the airport, large red banners could be seen in giant hangars calling for long-term "hardship", "dedication" and "struggle" to meet the firm's goals. China is pushing for recognition globally of its certification by European and U.S. regulators as without their certification, it would only be able to sell the jet to a handful of countries that accept its certification standards. But Beijing is already looking beyond the C919, with plans to develop a wide-body long-haul jet with Russia. In November COMAC and its partner United Aircraft Corp said they have started the hunt to find suppliers.

May 07, 2017 0656 GMT Home Iran Africa Asia Europe International U.S. Middle East Culture Business Health Sport Society Video News ID:192202 Publish Date: Sat, 06 May 2017 13:14:23 GMT Service: Iran US Congress mulls crackdown on Iran airlines A new legislation is circulating through US Senate that would require the government to crack down on an Iranian airline company, American media reports say. Mahan Air is the target of the measure which would require the Trump administration to provide Congress with a list of all airports where the commercial carrier has landed, the report said. Those airports as well as all planes flying into the United States from anywhere used by Mahan Air would be subject to scrutiny and crackdown, it added.     "The move is being viewed as just the first move by Congress against Mahan and other Iranian airline carriers,” the pro-Israeli website Washington Free Beacon reported. Mahan Air is under US sanctions as of Oct. 2011, with the US government saying company’s assets were “blockable”. It comes at a time when national flag carrier IranAir is in the process of hammering down multi-billion dollar deals with Boeing and other major plane builders. US lawmakers have repeatedly tried to scuttle the deals, but those efforts have gained momentum under the administration of President Donald Trump who has signaled a harsher approach than his predecessor toward Iran. Last year, the US House voted to block financing for the aircraft sales to Iran and Republican lawmakers called on Trump to intervene. Trump has ordered a review of a nuclear accord which the US reached with Iran along with France, Britain, Germany, China and Russia in 2015. During his election campaign, Trump repeatedly called the deal a “disaster,” vowing to tear it up and “double and triple up sanctions.” While the US president has not gone ahead with that threat, he has presided over new sanctions being imposed on the Islamic Republic in breach of the nuclear agreement.  Boeing’s plan to sell commercial aircraft to Iran was part of the US compromise which led to the nuclear agreement but it has been deviled by numerous subversive measures. Under the agreement, Boeing must supply IranAir some 80 passenger jets but US congressional moves to block it have cast a shadow over the fate of the deal. Last week, Boeing Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg tried to dispel doubts, saying the company was making “steady progress” to finalize terms of the sale to IranAir and expected to deliver the initial planes next year. Boeing’s European rival Airbus has already delivered three planes in a $19 billion sale struck last year. The aircraft deals are one of the few tangible fruits of the nuclear accord, which required that all economic sanctions be lifted against the Islamic Republic. However, the elusive rewards of the nuclear accord coupled with banking difficulties have rankled many Iranians and put the government under pressure. Iran has been unable to secure financing for the purchases because most Western banks are refraining from trading with the country over fears of coming under punitive American measures. Iran’s Deputy Roads and Urban Development Minister Asghar Fakhrieh-Kashan was quoted as saying Friday that Britain’s export credit arm, UK Export Finance (UKEF), had tentatively offered financing support for at least some Airbus jets.                                                                           KeyWords airlines US mulls   Comments Comment Name: Email: Comment: Security Key: Latest News Raeisi hits back after Rouhani files complaint over debate allegations Iran raps US nuclear stance as provocative, warns about arms race Heavy rains, flooding hit several cities in Iran Iran-Ireland ties on right track Zarif due in Kabul today Velayati hails Germany’s role in shaping independent European policies US Congress mulls crackdown on Iran airlines Live debates reflect importance of Iran elections: Analyst Scrapping Iran deal in no one’s interest: EU’s Mogherini Iran slams ISIL missile attack on school in Mosul Most Visited US pushing Korean Peninsula to brink of nuclear war: Pyongyang USS Carl Vinson sails in Japanese waters towards Korean Peninsula FBI agent fled US to marry Daesh member she was assigned to probe www.irandailyonline.com All rights reserved by iran Daily Online Copyright Page Generated in 0/1231 sec

Delivery of the first of the new aircraft is due to begin in June. Meantime, FAA and European inspectors were flying the simulator as part of the certification process. CAROL ROSENBERG crosenberg@miamiherald.com Business May 04, 2017 4:02 PM What’s it like to fly Boeing’s new jetliner? Pilots will soon find out in Miami simulator By Carol Rosenberg crosenberg@miamiherald.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story When U.S. pilots start flying into Miami soon for training on Boeing’s new jetliner, they’ll get a full-body experience. A 737 MAX simulator shown to media and airline representatives on Thursday offers an opportunity to sit in an exact replica of a cockpit of the new aircraft — to be delivered to the first airline customers in June — for training before delivery. From the cockpit, trainees see video reproductions that let them practice taking off, landing and flying, and experience the tilt, turbulence and climb of an actual aircraft. On Thursday, Miami’s Boeing Campus training site gave airline representatives and reporters a look at its new simulation suites and full-flight simulator, a pod-like unit containing the cockpit. It is Boeing’s only U.S. site where pilots can train on the new aircraft. Delivery to airlines begins in June. The media day visit also showed the 16-student classroom where mechanics are training specifically on the new aircraft, distinguishable from other 737s by its split-tipped winglet. Seattle-based Jayson Remfert, Boeing’s maintenance training product manager, said the program teaches already seasoned airline mechanics how to maintain and monitor a 737 MAX, even before they get hands-on experience with the real thing. Miami is the first campus to offer “MAX training” for the plane, also called the 737-8, said Martin Schaaf, campus manager. Boeing will later set up simulation classes in Singapore, Gatwick and Shanghai to train pilots for the 3,700-plus MAX aircraft already ordered by 87 airlines around the world. Miami is the first to have the 737 MAX classroom, Schaaf said, because “it’s a great aviation community” with proximity to “many of our customers.” More than a dozen airlines have already signed up to do their 737 MAX training in Miami, Schaaf said, including Aer Lingus, Air Mexico, American, Air Canada, Alaska Airlines, COPA and Southwest. Some of them also toured the training sites on Thursday. The MAX version caused a mini-stir earlier this week when CNN disclosed American Airlines’ plan to shrink the legroom in economy class in the new model. Simulation has come a long way since pilots underwent rote memorization and learning from manuals with classroom lectures, said Seattle-based Scott Anderson of the 737 MAX training development team, as he demonstrated Miami’s simulation suite capable of teaching four pilots at a time. Today, they learn with hands-on training. Rather than sit at a desk, the pilots sit side by side at a flat-panel, interactive flight deck computerized cockpit before graduating to a full-flight simulators. Today’s generation “don’t want to read about it. They want to do it,” Anderson said. “The students of the future, they’re not afraid of technology.” Old school overlaps with new school at a 737 MAX simulation training room at Boeing’s Miami Campus, where the aircraft manufacturer unveiled its training suites for the new 737 due to begin service in June with delivery of the first of 3,700 aircraft to some 87 airlines. CAROL ROSENBERG crosenberg@miamiherald.com Thursday, the campus team showed the 737 MAX full cockpit simulator. Its computerized program was frozen in flight over foggy Washington state during a break in checks by inspectors from the FAA and European aviation agencies. Boeing has about 1,600 employees in Florida, with 100 of those at the Miami training center. Others are at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center and Cape Canaveral Air Force Station and in Jacksonville, where the firm supports Navy P-8 training.

China's home-grown C919 passenger jet completed its long-delayed maiden flight on Friday, a major first step for Beijing as it looks to raise its profile in the global aviation market and boost high-tech manufacturing at home. Under overcast skies, the white, green and blue aircraft, with "C919" emblazoned on its tail, touched down at Shanghai's international airport after an 80-minute flight to cheers from thousands of dignitaries, aviation workers and enthusiasts. The jet is a symbol of China's ambitions to muscle into a global jet market estimated to be worth $2 trillion over the next two decades, as well as of Beijing's broader "Made in China 2025" plan to spur home-made products, from medicines to robots. "Seeing the C919 take off into the sky made me quite emotional. This is a moment we have waited to see for a very long time," Wang Mingfeng, 42, who witnessed the maiden flight at the Shanghai airport, told Reuters. "I believe that in the not too distant future, we will be neck-and-neck with Boeing and Airbus." At the moment, though, Boeing and Airbus remain far ahead in terms of sales, technical know-how and order books. And the C919, whose test flight was pushed back at least twice since 2014 due to production issues, may need years of tests to get certified in China, as well as in the United States and Europe. On Friday, the C919 flew north over the Yangtze River delta, carried out manoeuvres and then returned south along the coast before landing, according to aircraft tracker Flightradar24. State media said the plane flew at around 3,000 meters and at speeds of 290-300 kilometers (180-186 miles) per hour. The crew of five pilots and engineers, all wearing orange jump suits and aviators, were applauded as they disembarked. The plane, which can carry 158-168 passengers, had no passenger seats installed for the maiden flight. A letter from China's ministerial cabinet, read out after the plane landed, said the successful flight marked a "major breakthrough" and milestone for China's passenger jet industry. The industry ministry said in a statement the flight went smoothly and that all the systems functioned properly. The C919, made by state-owned Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC), relies on overseas technology from firms including General Electric , France's Safran , Honeywell International Inc and United Technologies Corp subsidiary Goodrich. China Eastern Airlines is the launch customer for the plane, which COMAC says has 570 orders from 23 customers. Hardship, Struggle Conceived in 2008, China wants the C919 to eventually take market share from Boeing and Airbus in the lucrative narrow-body market which accounts for more than 50 percent of the aircraft in service worldwide. For a TIMELINE on the C919, click "Every year we spend billions on buying planes," a COMAC promotional video showed President Xi Jinping saying during a site visit. He added China should become more self-reliant. However, the jet likely faces a lengthy journey from first flight to commercial usage. China's first home-made jet, the regional ARJ-21, received its type certification in December 2014, six years after its first flight and more than 12 years after it was conceived. It made its maiden passenger flight in June last year. Then there is also the daunting task of selling the jet in a global market dominated by Boeing and Airbus. "Aviation is a complex market and you need experience over a long time. Boeing has 100 years, Airbus has over 40 years," said Sinolink Securities analyst Si Jingzhe, adding COMAC still lagged far behind in terms of supply chain know-how. China is aware the path won't be easy. On a media visit on Thursday to COMAC's C919 assembly plant less than 10 kilometers from the airport, large red banners could be seen in giant hangars calling for long-term "hardship", "dedication" and "struggle" to meet the firm's goals. China is pushing for recognition globally of its certification by European and U.S. regulators as without their certification, it would only be able to sell the jet to a handful of countries that accept its certification standards. But Beijing is already looking beyond the C919, with plans to develop a wide-body long-haul jet with Russia. In November COMAC and its partner United Aircraft Corp said they have started the hunt to find suppliers.

The work will include High Flight Hour (HFH) inspections, modifications and liaison engineering and is due to be completed in December 2017, the Defense Department added. Defense Secretary James Mattis ordered a comparison of the hugely expensive and controversial Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter and the F/A-18 not long after President Donald Trump was inaugurated in January. Around the same time, Boeing, the manufacturer of the F/A-18, circulated a document suggesting that the Navy had a "significant capability gaps against emerging threats" with the F-35, according to the Navy Times, and that updating the F/A-18 was more efficient that buying new F-35 jets. ...

Photo: Mari Rheeder. Boeing Street in Elardus Park, east of Pretoria, has become a major concern for road users and residents. Ward 47 councillor Rita Aucamp said she had been struggling for years to get the road in a better condition. ALSO READ: Moreleta Park pothole to be fixed soon The road was unevenly paved, its shoulder was deteriorating and the surface was riddled with potholes. Aucamp said one half of the road was a provincial one, with the other part being the responsibility of the Tshwane metro. “We repair the potholes as they come, but the province does not to their part,” said Aucamp. The road was now becoming a risk and danger for road users. “This is a very bad situation, to repair only potholes wont help any longer. The road would need to be redone completely.” ALSO READ: Reporting potholes now a breeze Aucamp handed a petition on the matter this week to the DA’s transport spokesperson in the Gauteng legislature, Justus de Goede. De Goede said the petition with its 1200 signatures would now be submitted to the petition committee. “A public meeting will be held to discuss the road,” said De Goede. He said that questions about the road were conveyed to the MMC. “He will need to answer to these questions.” He said if this road and its upkeep did not appear on the books for the new financial year, the MMC would have some explaining to do. “It costs about R25 million a kilometre to redo a road like this one,” said De Goede. Metro spokesperson Lindela Mashigo said residents could report potholes to: Pothole@tshwane.gov.za or Jefrey.Mabelane@gauteng.gov.za. Mashigo said many roads in a bad condition had reached the end of their life span. “The recommendation is that the road be patched intensively (with a bitumen base) and sealed with a rubber bitumen seal to prevent water penetration on the patch joints.” Mashigo said, upkeep or maintenance would be continuously done where possible.

It successfully landed some 80 minutes later and the five-member crew was handed flowers, with captain Cai Jun describing the flight as “very satisfactory”. Built by state-owned aerospace manufacturer Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC), the plane represents nearly a decade of effort in a government-mandated drive to reduce dependence on European consortium Airbus and US aerospace giant Boeing. “China's big commercial jet project made a huge breakthrough. It is a major milestone of China's aviation market,” China's State Council said in a statement. State media said the plane flew at an altitude of around 3,000 metres (9,800 feet), some 7,000 metres lower than a regular trip, and at a speed of more than 300 kilometres (186 miles) per hour. While delayed since last year, the flight is the latest sign of China's growing ambition and technical skill, coming one week after the country launched its first domestically made aircraft carrier and docked a cargo spacecraft with an orbiting space lab. China has dreamt of building its own civil aircraft since the 1970s, when it began work on the narrow-body Y-10, which was eventually deemed unviable and never entered service.   US$1 TRILLION MARKET President Xi Jinping himself has endorsed the new project. His call to arms is emblazoned on the wall of the jet's production facility: “Accelerate the construction of the world's top aviation company and continue to make new contributions to develop a strong aviation industry.” China is a massive battleground for Boeing and Airbus, with the country's travel market expected to surpass the United States' by 2024, according to the International Air Transport Association. Airbus and Boeing estimate that Chinese airlines will need between 6,000-6,800 aircraft at a total price of around US $1 trillion. Both companies congratulated COMAC on the flight. The twin-engine C919, whose name sounds like the Chinese word for “everlasting”, can seat 168 passengers in an arrangement similar to other narrow-body jets: three white-velvet upholstered seats line each side of its central aisle. It has a range of 5,555 kilometres (3,444 miles) and has received 570 orders, almost all from domestic airlines. COMAC made two planes for the test flight and it expects to produce four more by 2019, said Bao Pengli, deputy head of Shanghai Aircraft Manufacturing Co, COMAC's production arm. The Shanghai-based firm aims to become one of the world's leading civil aircraft manufacturer in the next three years, seeking to have the C919 and its ARJ21, a smaller 90-seat regional jet, both certified to fly internationally. But it will be sometime before the C919 is ready to compete with the top-selling products of the world's aviation giants, said Bao. “The biggest challenge is that the whole manufacturing experience still needs improvement because this is the first time China is making a primary route plane,” Bao said.   EARNING TRUST The C919 will need to pass more tests to obtain Chinese airworthiness certification and COMAC hopes to get the green light from US and European regulators. The ARJ21 plane, which entered service in 2016, several years late, is currently restricted to flying domestic routes as it still lacks the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certification. Another challenge for the C919 is earning consumers' trust, said Shukor Yusof, an analyst with Malaysia-based aviation consultancy Endau Analytics. “It will take some time for customers around the world to be comfortable buying Chinese aeroplanes,” he said, adding, “it's not going to happen in the next 10 years.” “It's going to be incredibly tough not because it's not a good product. But because you need to get comfort and credibility to the product among potential clients, potential customers.” ADVERTISEMENT POST A COMMENT HOUSE RULES 1.

  More than just China's pride, large passenger jet C919 "win-win" for global market                Xinhua Weibo Facebook Twitter Reddit Diigo Delicious Digg Linkedin MySpace Sina Weibo Kaixin Renren Q-zone Tencent Weibo Sohu Weibo NetEase Weibo   Source: Xinhua | 2017-05-07 04:19:32 | Editor: huaxia The photo provided by COMAC shows that China's first domestically-built large passenger jet C919 at a hanger of the Chemmercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC) in Shanghai, China, on May 5, 2017. The plane completes its maiden test flight on the same day. (Xinhua/Photo) by Xinhua Writer Guo Shuang LOS ANGELES, May 6 (Xinhua) -- China's first indigenously-designed large passenger aircraft, the C919, successfully completed its maiden flight on Friday in the eastern city of Shanghai, providing a win-win cooperation for both China and the global market. "The C919 not only generates a great source of pride for China, but also represents mutual benefits and cooperation between China and the rest of the world. For this reason, the C919 program also carries the pride and hopes of people across the globe," Ye Wei, executive director and president of COMAC America Corporation, told Xinhua in an interview on Thursday at his office in Los Angeles, California. The successful flying of C919 is a crucial step in earning its manufacturer, COMAC (Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China), a position alongside Airbus and Boeing as a major player in the large passenger aircraft industry, where the three players could become known as the "ABC" of aircraft manufacturing. AVIATION INNOVATION Out of the overall design of the C919, the airframe is, from its initial design to calculations, testing, and construction, independently researched and developed in China. The research and development of the airframe gave rise to multiple technical breakthroughs, such as the unique design of the supercritical wing and different applications of new construction materials. While some may consider the airframe to just be the shell of an aircraft, Ye emphasized that the development of the airframe represents a major technical component of large aircraft manufacturing. As one of the most difficult steps in the aircraft design process, the C919's airframe technology represents a major step forward for China's aircraft manufacturing industry. INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION At the same time, the C919 can be considered a paragon of global cooperation. Major components such as the engines, avionics, control systems, and more are sourced from numerous joint ventures and partners across Europe and the United States. With major suppliers such as General Electric and Honeywell, the C919 project can be said to cover the world. The C919 features major components from 17 Level 1 suppliers around the globe, with Level 2 and 3 suppliers numbering in the hundreds. "This is why the C919 is more than just China's pride. It also represents mutual benefit that stretches far beyond China's borders," Ye said. In order to succeed in an increasingly globalized business world, international cooperation is a must. From this point of view, the C919 provides significant economic benefits to each of its international suppliers and their nations. In posts on its social media accounts, Honeywell stated that with nearly 1,000 of their employees across the world working to support the C919 project, the entire Honeywell workforce shared COMAC's pride at the success of the first flight. Darius Adamczyk, Chairman and CEO of Honeywell was one of the first to send his congratulations to COMAC Chairman Jin Zhuanglong, which read: "We are extremely proud that COMAC chose Honeywell to provide four major systems for this sleek and modern aircraft. We are proud of our partnership with COMAC and eager to continue to help advance aviation capabilities in China." The COMAC provided picture shows that China's homegrown large passenger plane C919 makes its maiden test flight in Shanghai, China, on May 5, 2017. (Xinhua/Photo) NO THREAT TO BOEING, AIRBUS At the moment, China's large passenger aircraft have a long way to go before they can truly compete with Boeing and Airbus on the international market, much less present a genuine threat to either manufacturer. Over a considerably long timeframe, the C919 is planned to mainly be used in China's domestic market, helping to meet its demand. In the short term, production of the C919 will be limited and its numbers will be far from enough to make a significant impact. At the moment, the C919 has a total of 570 orders, the vast majority of which were made by domestic Chinese customers. In fact, at the moment Boeing and Airbus are enthusiastically cooperating with COMAC, making use of the Chinese company's manpower and resources to develop the Chinese aviation market. As one of COMAC's major international partners, Aviage Systems is responsible for three avionics work packages on the C919. Immediately following the first flight of C919, company Chairman and CEO Alan Jones sent COMAC his best wishes, stating "Aviage Systems is very proud to be COMAC's close partner as both sides worked with common purpose, encouraging each other and overcoming obstacles along the way. We are honored to be a part of this historical occasion." Regarding the significance of the first flight and the road ahead, Robert Morefield, a senior aeronautical engineer with over 40 years of experience in the industry,said, "The success of the C919's first flight is a critical step in the comprehensive test flight process. This milestone opens the path for a multitude of required future test flights that will ensure the aircraft is safe and ready for public service." However, among congratulations from all over the world, there were some who used the occasion to politicize the C919 program and treat it as if it was a threat to the rest of the world. "This is a very shortsighted way of looking at it," said Ye, referring to these criticisms. "With cooperation comes mutual benefit.

(Xinhua/Photo) by Xinhua Writer Guo Shuang LOS ANGELES, May 6 (Xinhua) -- China's first indigenously-designed large passenger aircraft, the C919, successfully completed its maiden flight on Friday in the eastern city of Shanghai, providing a win-win cooperation for both China and the global market. "The C919 not only generates a great source of pride for China, but also represents mutual benefits and cooperation between China and the rest of the world. For this reason, the C919 program also carries the pride and hopes of people across the globe," Ye Wei, executive director and president of COMAC America Corporation, told Xinhua in an interview on Thursday at his office in Los Angeles, California. The successful flying of C919 is a crucial step in earning its manufacturer, COMAC (Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China), a position alongside Airbus and Boeing as a major player in the large passenger aircraft industry, where the three players could become known as the "ABC" of aircraft manufacturing. AVIATION INNOVATION Out of the overall design of the C919, the airframe is, from its initial design to calculations, testing, and construction, independently researched and developed in China. The research and development of the airframe gave rise to multiple technical breakthroughs, such as the unique design of the supercritical wing and different applications of new construction materials. While some may consider the airframe to just be the shell of an aircraft, Ye emphasized that the development of the airframe represents a major technical component of large aircraft manufacturing. As one of the most difficult steps in the aircraft design process, the C919's airframe technology represents a major step forward for China's aircraft manufacturing industry. INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION At the same time, the C919 can be considered a paragon of global cooperation. Major components such as the engines, avionics, control systems, and more are sourced from numerous joint ventures and partners across Europe and the United States. With major suppliers such as General Electric and Honeywell, the C919 project can be said to cover the world. The C919 features major components from 17 Level 1 suppliers around the globe, with Level 2 and 3 suppliers numbering in the hundreds. "This is why the C919 is more than just China's pride. It also represents mutual benefit that stretches far beyond China's borders," Ye said. In order to succeed in an increasingly globalized business world, international cooperation is a must. From this point of view, the C919 provides significant economic benefits to each of its international suppliers and their nations. In posts on its social media accounts, Honeywell stated that with nearly 1,000 of their employees across the world working to support the C919 project, the entire Honeywell workforce shared COMAC's pride at the success of the first flight. Darius Adamczyk, Chairman and CEO of Honeywell was one of the first to send his congratulations to COMAC Chairman Jin Zhuanglong, which read: "We are extremely proud that COMAC chose Honeywell to provide four major systems for this sleek and modern aircraft. We are proud of our partnership with COMAC and eager to continue to help advance aviation capabilities in China." The COMAC provided picture shows that China's homegrown large passenger plane C919 makes its maiden test flight in Shanghai, China, on May 5, 2017. (Xinhua/Photo) NO THREAT TO BOEING, AIRBUS At the moment, China's large passenger aircraft have a long way to go before they can truly compete with Boeing and Airbus on the international market, much less present a genuine threat to either manufacturer. Over a considerably long timeframe, the C919 is planned to mainly be used in China's domestic market, helping to meet its demand. In the short term, production of the C919 will be limited and its numbers will be far from enough to make a significant impact. At the moment, the C919 has a total of 570 orders, the vast majority of which were made by domestic Chinese customers. In fact, at the moment Boeing and Airbus are enthusiastically cooperating with COMAC, making use of the Chinese company's manpower and resources to develop the Chinese aviation market. As one of COMAC's major international partners, Aviage Systems is responsible for three avionics work packages on the C919. Immediately following the first flight of C919, company Chairman and CEO Alan Jones sent COMAC his best wishes, stating "Aviage Systems is very proud to be COMAC's close partner as both sides worked with common purpose, encouraging each other and overcoming obstacles along the way. We are honored to be a part of this historical occasion." Regarding the significance of the first flight and the road ahead, Robert Morefield, a senior aeronautical engineer with over 40 years of experience in the industry,said, "The success of the C919's first flight is a critical step in the comprehensive test flight process. This milestone opens the path for a multitude of required future test flights that will ensure the aircraft is safe and ready for public service." However, among congratulations from all over the world, there were some who used the occasion to politicize the C919 program and treat it as if it was a threat to the rest of the world. "This is a very shortsighted way of looking at it," said Ye, referring to these criticisms. "With cooperation comes mutual benefit. I think this is something people of every nation would like to see," he said. "If other countries were to refuse this cooperation and place unnecessary embargoes and limitations on these kinds of projects, it would only harm the idea of a fair and open market and ultimately damage the economic welfare of individuals throughout the world," Ye said.

Skip to content Sunday, May 7, 2017 About Advertise Privacy Business Featured Internet & Media About Privacy Advertise The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) Stock Ticks 0.10% May 6, 2017 Newswire      The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) shares have moved 0.10% on the week. The stock closed the most recent session at $185.01 after seeing 2628390 shares trade hands.  This represents a change of 1.01% from the opening. The closing price represents the final price that a stock is traded for on a trading day.  It’s the most up-to-date valuation until trading begins again on the next day. However, most financial instruments are traded after hours, which means that the the closing price of a stock might not match the after-hours price.  Regardless, closing prices are a useful tool that investors use to quantify changes in stock prices over time.  The closing prices are compared day-by-day to look for trends and can measure market sentiment for any security over the course of a trading day. Stock exchanges work according to the invisible hand of supply and demand, which determines the price where stocks are bought and sold.  No trade can occur until someone is willing to sell a stock at a price that another is willing to buy it at.  When there are more buyers than sellers, the stock price will rise because of the increased demand.  Conversely, if more individuals are selling a stock, the price will decrease. On any given trading day, supply and demand fluctuates back-and-forth because the attractiveness of a commodity’s price rises and falls.  Because of these fluctuations, the closing and opening prices are not necessarily identical.  A number of factors can affect the attractiveness of a stock in the hours between the closing bell and the next day’s opening bell.  For example, if there is good news like a positive earnings announcement, the demand for a stock may increase, raising the price from the previous day’s close.  It follows that bad news will negatively affect price.  RECENT PERFORMANCE Let’s take a look at how the stock has been performing recently.  Year to date The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) is 19.86%, 14.90% over the last quarter, and 33.59% for the past six months.  Over the past 50 days, The Boeing Company stock’s -0.38% off of the high and 6.48% removed from the low.  Their 52-Week High and Low are noted here.  -0.38% (High), 54.96%, (Low).  RSI Technical analysts have little regard for the value of a company. They use historic price data to observe stock price patterns to predict the direction of that price going forward.  Analysts use common formulas and ratios to accomplish this. The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA)’s RSI (Relative Strength Index) is 61.38.  RSI is a technical indicator of price momentum, comparing the size of recent gains to the size of recent losses and establishes oversold and overbought positions.

Share this story MASTER: Internationally renowned South African artist and queen of Ndebele art, Esther Mahlangu, has designed panels for a special edition, top-of-the-range BMW. A guest at the Made in Africa Exhibition on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Durban this week, Mahlangu said she loved travelling and had shown her Ndebele art in the US, Europe and Japan. The gogo from Mpumalanga was “discovered” by French art researchers in 1986 when they stumbled on her brightly painted Ndebele-style home in Weltevrede. She was invited to France to paint what was then the prototype of the new BMW525i. “It was the first time I went overseas and they told me there was no mealie meal, so I took over 50kg of my own. My favourite meal is still pap and marrow,” she said on Thursday. Her art proved to be a massive hit and her next giant work was to paint the tail of a Boeing plane. Her love for travelling was ignited, and over the next 20 years, she took the Ndebele patterns around the world. In October, her interior design of a BMW was unveiled in London. “It does take time, as I have to have interviews and talk to people. Wherever I go, people smile and welcome me." She recently partnered with Legend, and Belvedere Luxury Vodka to raise funds for HIV/Aids projects, with 50% of the proceeds going to fight Aids in mother-to-child projects. WEF sessions focused on the digital revolution, but Mahlangu said the challenge on the continent was that the youth were too caught up in technology. “They are too modernised and are forgetting our culture, which they need to take forward to the next generation." She has a collaboration in the pipeline, but it’s under wraps.

Scroll Staff Published May 05, 2017.   Reuters China’s first indigenous passenger jet made its maiden flight on Friday, Reuters reported. This marks the Asian giant’s entry into the highly-competitive global aviation sector which is dominated by Boeing and Airbus. The 158-seater C919 aircraft took off from Shanghai Pudong International Airport in eastern China, making the country the fourth after the United States, Europe and Russia to manufacture aircraft. The 80-minute flight was greeted with applause by more than 1,000 spectators on the tarmac, including Chinese Vice Premier Ma Kai and Shanghai Party chief Han Zheng. The twin-engine plane had five crew members and no passengers. “The maiden flight was exciting,” said Wu Guanghui, C919’s chief designer, adding that it was a major breakthrough in China’s civil aviation history, as well as the start of a new era of advanced manufacturing in the country. The “C” in the aircraft’s name stands for both China and Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China, while 9 symbolises “forever” in Chinese culture and 19 represents the maximum 190 seats capacity. The narrow- body jet is comparable with the updated Airbus 320 and Boeing’s new generation 737, signalling the country’s entry into the global aviation market, Chinese news agency Xinhua reported. The aircraft is part of the “Made in China 2025,” a project to make China a global manufacturing power.

(Photo: Greg Baker / AP) 1 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 2 COMMENTEMAILMORE Shanghai — The first large Chinese-made passenger jetliner completed its maiden test flight on Friday, a milestone in China’s long-term goal to break into the Western-dominated aircraft market. The takeoff of the C919 brought cheers and applause from hundreds of invited guests at Shanghai Pudong International Airport and was broadcast live on Chinese state television. The jet soon became invisible on a windy and polluted day in Shanghai, which was also in the path of dense sandstorms from the north. After the 1 ½ hour flight was over, the test pilots came down smiling from the plane, wearing orange overalls with the Chinese flag. With the flight, the official Xinhua News Agency said China had become “one of the world’s top makers of jumbo aircraft,” becoming the fourth large jet producer after the U.S., Europe and Russia. China is touting the C919 as a rival to single-aisle jets such as the Airbus A320 and Boeing 737. It was originally due to begin flying in 2014 and be delivered to buyers in 2016, but has been beset by delays blamed on manufacturing problems. It’s now unlikely to carry commercial passengers until at least 2019. Mohshin Aziz, a Kuala Lumpur-based aviation analyst at Maybank Kim Eng Securities, said it wouldn’t be clear for 7-9 years whether the C919 can make a dent in Airbus and Boeing’s duopoly. “This is just the test flight,” he said. “Eventually it needs to have some cornerstone customers, of which it will have because there are state-owned airlines, some of them are going to be forced to use it.” Mohshin said other potential customers would wait to see what experience the first customers have. “You are not going to spend a lot of money on something you don’t know,” he said. The jet’s development is a key step on the path laid out by Chinese leaders to transform the country from the world’s low-cost factory into a creator of profitable technology. At the same time, China’s aviation market is growing rapidly as a rising middle class travels more for leisure and business. Boeing forecasts an annual 6 percent growth in China’s air passenger traffic over the next two decades will create demand for 6,810 new planes worth a total of $1 trillion — the first trillion-dollar aviation market in its forecast. Of the new planes, 75 percent are expected to be single-aisle. Airbus has five joint ventures in China, including a factory that assembles A320s in Tianjin, a port city near Beijing, that opened in 2008. Mohshin said much of China’s aircraft technology started from Russia, and the Tianjin factory has since given China’s supply chain vital experience. “I would say that a lot of their technology mirrors Airbus,” he said. 1 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 2 COMMENTEMAILMORE Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.

The white, green and blue aircraft, with “C919” emblazoned on its tail, sped along the tarmac at Shanghai’s international airport and lifted off under overcast skies in front of thousands of dignitaries, aviation workers and enthusiasts. The narrow-body jet, which will compete with Boeing’s 737 and the Airbus A320, soon disappeared into the clouds carrying its skeleton crew of five pilots and engineers. State broadcaster CCTV sent out live footage from the plane, which had no passenger seats installed for the maiden flight. The jet is a symbol of China’s ambitions to muscle into a global jet market estimated to be worth $2 trillion over the next two decades, as well as Beijing’s broader “Made in China 2025” plan to spur home-made products, from medicines to robots. “The significance is huge, it’s the first ever large-frame aircraft made in China,” Xiong Yuexi, a plane design expert at Beihang University in Beijing said ahead of the launch. “It has a great impact for the Chinese people and the domestic market.” State television reported the plane’s test flight would last one-and-a-half hours at a height of around 3,000 metres and at speeds of 290-300 kilometres (180-186 miles) per hour. According to aircraft tracker Flightradar24, the plane flew over the Yangtze River estuary and headed due north. The C919, made by state-owned Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC), has seen its test flight pushed back at least twice since 2014 due to production issues, underlining the scale of the task facing Beijing. China first gave the world a glimpse of the plane, which will be able to carry 158-168 passengers, in November 2015 when it rolled it out at a ceremony in Shanghai. Analysts, however, say the C919 will lag technologically behind improved versions of the A320 and 737 which will enter service in the next two years. China Eastern Airlines is the launch customer for the plane, which COMAC says has 570 orders from 23 customers. The plane also relies on an array of overseas technology, with CFM International, a joint venture between General Electric’s aerospace arm and a unit of French firm Safran supplying the engines. Others include Honeywell International Inc, United Technologies Corp subsidiary Goodrich, Rockwell Collins Inc and a unit of Parker-Hannifin Corp. Conceived in 2008, China wants the C919 to eventually take market share from Boeing and Airbus in the lucrative narrow-body market which accounts for more than 50 per cent of the aircraft in service worldwide. However, the jet likely faces a lengthy journey from first flight to commercial usage. China’s first home-made jet, the regional ARJ-21, received its type certification in December 2014, six years after its first flight and more than 12 years after it was conceived. — Reuters About the author View all articles by Oman Observer ← Goldman’s Blankfein says London could stall due to Brexit Influence of English is fading, says EU chief → ← Previous Next → Search Recent Posts Recent Sultanate targets special interest tourists Direct air link to Manchester to boost ties with Britain Online games harmful for your children HM’s condolences to Saudi conveyed Read More ...

China’s first-ever domestically designed and built civilian airliner took its maiden flight Thursday in a watershed moment for the country’s aviation industry and new competitor to Western giants that have the market cornered. On Friday, a crowd of some 3,000 Chinese officials and industry execs gathered at the Shanghai airport to watch the test flight of the C919, China’s answer to the Boeing-737 and Airbus-320, the workhorse planes for global airlines. The C919 landed safely after an hour-long test flight, marking a major milestone in China’s long-term ambition to crack into the global civilian airline market. Built by state-owned aircraft corporation Comac, the C919 is designed to seat 155-175 with a range of 2,530 miles. U.S.-based Boeing and Europe-based Airbus Group have in essence dominated that market from the beginning, but Western executives may not be sweating the C919 just yet. The Chinese project was riddled with technical problems and delays from the outset (the test flight Friday was originally scheduled for three years ago) and it relies heavily on foreign technologies to function. Comac also still hasn’t proven itself capable of producing high quality planes that can pass toptier Western safety inspections on part with the Boeing-Airbus duopoly. Comac announced it’s already received 570 orders from 23 customers, but nearly every sale comes from Chinese companies. (The plane also has one U.S. buyer: General Electric Capital Aviation Services, a supplier to the C919 program, ordered 20 planes from Comac.) And that’s a small drop in the bucket compared to Boeing, which can roll out 400-500 Boeing 737’s a year. Still, industry experts agree Boeing and Airbus are watching Comac with a wary eye. The International Air Transport Association estimates China will overtake the United States as the world’s top aviation market by 2024. Over the next 20 years, the IATA forecasts there will be an additional 817 million passengers from China alone, making it the world’s fastest growing market. And Comac has the home-field advantage.

The jet is a symbol of China's ambitions to muscle into a global jet market estimated to be worth $2 trillion over the next two decades, as well as of Beijing's broader "Made in China 2025" plan to spur home-made products, from medicines to robots.   "Seeing the C919 take off into the sky made me quite emotional. This is a moment we have waited to see for a very long time," Wang Mingfeng, 42, who witnessed the maiden flight at the Shanghai airport, told Reuters. "I believe that in the not too distant future, we will be neck-and-neck with Boeing and Airbus."   At the moment, though, Boeing and Airbus remain far ahead in terms of sales, technical know-how and order books. And the C919, whose test flight was pushed back at least twice since 2014 due to production issues, may need years of tests to get certified in China, as well as in the United States and Europe.   On Friday, the C919 flew north over the Yangtze River delta, carried out manoeuvres and then returned south along the coast before landing, according to aircraft tracker Flightradar24. State media said the plane flew at around 3,000 metres and at speeds of 290-300 kilometres (180-186 miles) per hour.   The crew of five pilots and engineers, all wearing orange jump suits and aviators, were applauded as they disembarked. The plane, which can carry 158-168 passengers, had no passenger seats installed for the maiden flight.   A letter from China's ministerial cabinet, read out after the plane landed, said the successful flight marked a "major breakthrough" and milestone for China's passenger jet industry. The industry ministry said in a statement the flight went smoothly and that all the systems functioned properly.   The C919, made by state-owned Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC), relies on overseas technology from firms including General Electric, France's Safran, Honeywell International Inc and United Technologies Corp subsidiary Goodrich. China Eastern Airlines is the launch customer for the plane, which COMAC says has 570 orders from 23 customers.   Conceived in 2008, China wants the C919 to eventually take market share from Boeing and Airbus in the lucrative narrow-body market which accounts for more than 50 percent of the aircraft in service worldwide. "Every year we spend billions on buying planes," a COMAC promotional video showed President Xi Jinping saying during a site visit. He added China should become more self-reliant.   However, the jet likely faces a lengthy journey from first flight to commercial usage. China's first home-made jet, the regional ARJ-21, received its type certification in December 2014, six years after its first flight and more than 12 years after it was conceived. It made its maiden passenger flight in June last year.   Then there is also the daunting task of selling the jet in a global market dominated by Boeing and Airbus.

Business Home LBoard NGO and think-tank plan anti-graft campaign in Pekan Ho Kit Yen Read More FMT BAHASA FMT BORNEO+ FMT VIDEO CONTRIBUTE NEWS HOME NATION OPINION WORLD LEISURE SPORTS BUSINESS ADVERTISE WITH US With maiden jet flight, China enters dog-fight with Boeing, Airbus Reuters | May 6, 2017 The jet is a symbol of China's ambitions to muscle into a global jet market estimated to be worth US$2 trillion over the next two decades, as well as of Beijing's broader "Made in China 2025" plan to spur home-made products, from medicines to robots. SHANGHAI: China’s home-grown C919 passenger jet completed its long-delayed maiden flight on Friday, a major first step for Beijing as it looks to raise its profile in the global aviation market and boost high-tech manufacturing at home. Under overcast skies, the white, green and blue aircraft, with “C919” emblazoned on its tail, touched down at Shanghai’s international airport after an 80-minute flight to cheers from thousands of dignitaries, aviation workers and enthusiasts. The jet is a symbol of China’s ambitions to muscle into a global jet market estimated to be worth US$2 trillion over the next two decades, as well as of Beijing’s broader “Made in China 2025” plan to spur home-made products, from medicines to robots. “Seeing the C919 take off into the sky made me quite emotional. This is a moment we have waited to see for a very long time,” Wang Mingfeng, 42, who witnessed the maiden flight at the Shanghai airport, told Reuters. “I believe that in the not too distant future, we will be neck-and-neck with Boeing and Airbus.” At the moment, though, Boeing and Airbus remain far ahead in terms of sales, technical know-how and order books. And the C919, whose test flight was pushed back at least twice since 2014 due to production issues, may need years of tests to get certified in China, as well as in the United States and Europe. On Friday, the C919 flew north over the Yangtze River delta, carried out manoeuvres and then returned south along the coast before landing, according to aircraft tracker Flightradar24. State media said the plane flew at around 3,000 meters and at speeds of 290-300 kilometers (180-186 miles) per hour. The crew of five pilots and engineers, all wearing orange jump suits and aviators, were applauded as they disembarked. The plane, which can carry 158-168 passengers, had no passenger seats installed for the maiden flight. A letter from China’s ministerial cabinet, read out after the plane landed, said the successful flight marked a “major breakthrough” and milestone for China’s passenger jet industry. The industry ministry said in a statement the flight went smoothly and that all the systems functioned properly. The C919, made by state-owned Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC), relies on overseas technology from firms including General Electric, France’s Safran, Honeywell International Inc and United Technologies Corp subsidiary Goodrich. China Eastern Airlines is the launch customer for the plane, which COMAC says has 570 orders from 23 customers. Hardship, struggle Conceived in 2008, China wants the C919 to eventually take market share from Boeing and Airbus in the lucrative narrow-body market which accounts for more than 50% of the aircraft in service worldwide. “Every year we spend billions on buying planes,” a COMAC promotional video showed President Xi Jinping saying during a site visit. He added China should become more self-reliant. However, the jet likely faces a lengthy journey from first flight to commercial usage. China’s first home-made jet, the regional ARJ-21, received its type certification in December 2014, six years after its first flight and more than 12 years after it was conceived. It made its maiden passenger flight in June last year. Then there is also the daunting task of selling the jet in a global market dominated by Boeing and Airbus. “Aviation is a complex market and you need experience over a long time. Boeing has 100 years, Airbus has over 40 years,” said Sinolink Securities analyst Si Jingzhe, adding COMAC still lagged far behind in terms of supply chain know-how. China is aware the path won’t be easy. On a media visit on Thursday to COMAC’s C919 assembly plant less than 10 kilometers from the airport, large red banners could be seen in giant hangars calling for long-term “hardship”, “dedication” and “struggle” to meet the firm’s goals. China is pushing for recognition globally of its certification by European and US regulators as without their certification, it would only be able to sell the jet to a handful of countries that accept its certification standards. But Beijing is already looking beyond the C919, with plans to develop a wide-body long-haul jet with Russia. In November COMAC and its partner United Aircraft Corp said they have started the hunt to find suppliers. Comments Readers are required to have a valid Facebook account to comment on this story.

May 7th, 2017 by Thomas Friedman/New York Times News Service in Opinion Times Commentary FILE - In this March 31, 2017 file photo, a portrait of former President Andrew Jackson hangs on the wall behind President Donald Trump in the Oval Office. Trump made puzzling claims about Andrew Jackson and the Civil War in an interview recently. (AP Photo/Andrew Harnik, File) Photo by Andrew Harnik Has the first 100 days of the presidency made Donald Trump nuts? I don't ask that question as a doctor. I don't do medical diagnoses. I ask it as a newspaper reader. You read all of Trump's 100-day interviews and they are just bizarre. Out of nowhere Trump tells us he would be "honored" to negotiate directly with the leader of North Korea, after weeks of threatening war. Out of nowhere he says he would consider a gasoline tax to pay for infrastructure. Out of nowhere he says he is considering breaking up the nation's biggest banks. He also insists that his Obamacare replacement legislation contains protections for people with pre-existing conditions that it doesn't. There's barely a dictator in the world for whom he doesn't have praise. And he repeats a known falsehood — that Barack Obama wiretapped him — and tells reporters they should go find the truth, when, as president, he could get the truth from the FBI with one phone call, and when pressed whether he stands by that allegation, answers, "I don't stand by anything." Is this a political strategy unfolding or a psychiatric condition unfolding? I don't know — but it tells me that absolutely anything is possible in the next 100 days — both good and bad. In his first 100 days, allies and adversaries saved Trump and the country from some of his most extreme, ill-considered campaign promises. His foreign policy team stopped him from tearing up the Iran nuclear deal and moving the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. North Korea's missile-loving dictator saved him from declaring China a currency manipulator and starting a trade war with Beijing, because Trump discovered he needed China to restrain North Korea to avoid a war. Boeing and General Electric restrained Trump from getting rid of the Export-Import Bank, which would have left U.S. exporters at a big disadvantage. The federal courts prevented him from imposing his Muslim ban. Border-state Republicans blocked his Mexico wall and other Republicans are blocking his draconian replacement of Obamacare. U.S. farmers, whose exports to Mexico have soared since NAFTA was signed, dissuaded him from walking out of that trade deal. As for the next 100 days, who will protect us? Myself, I am not counting on the Democratic Party. It's too weak. On the issues I care about most, I'm actually counting on California. I believe California's market size, aspirational goals and ability to legislate make it the most powerful opposition party to Trump in America today. How so? Trump wants to scrap Obama-era standards requiring passenger cars to average about 51 mpg by 2025; today it's just under 37 mpg. But as the Los Angeles Times recently noted, under the Clean Air Act, California "can impose emissions standards stronger than those set by the federal government, and a dozen other states have embraced the California rules." More than one-third of the vehicles sold in the United States are subject to the rules California sets. Trump can deregulate U.S. automakers to make more gas guzzlers all he wants, but they can't if they want to sell cars in California. Trump can sue, but that will take years. Ditto California companies: Apple is now powering 96 percent of its operations around the world with renewable energy — 100 percent in 24 countries — including the U.S. and China. Trump's pro-coal campaign will never get Apple back on coal. As Kevin de León, leader of the California state Senate, told me: California has far more clean energy jobs than there are coal jobs in all of America, and California's now nation-leading growth rate in jobs gives the lie to everything Trump says: You can have gradually rising clean energy standards, innovation, job creation and GDP growth — all at the same time. California is also leading the resistance to Trump's draconian immigration policies, with a web of initiatives embracing tighter border controls while also creating health care, education and work opportunities for unauthorized immigrants who have been living here responsibly and productively. "We have made it very clear — we will protect our economic prosperity and our values from Trump," said de León, whose Legislature recently hired former Attorney General Eric Holder to defend it against Trump suits. Holder is California's (and my) secretary of defense.

David Pollard reports. Video Transcript Shares slipped but not the mood in early trading on Europe's markets. At least when it came to some of the headline makers. First up: Syngenta. ChemChina says it's won more than enough support from the Swiss company's shareholders to clinch its $43 billion takeover. China's biggest foreign takeover to date ... (SOUNDBITE) (English) LCG SENIOR ANALYST, JASPER LAWLER, SAYING: "Where maybe ChemChina benefit most from the from the deal, is that it's a less developed market. They have less sophisticated seeds and other products that Syngenta can bring to the bring to the table. And so it's going to help develop China." In new competition for Airbus and Boeing, the day also saw China's first home-grown large passenger jet taking off on its maiden flight. In Europe, BA-owner IAG shares did the same - on record Q1 profits. (SOUNDBITE) (English) LCG SENIOR ANALYST, JASPER LAWLER, SAYING: "Really it's the lower fuel costs. They're helping IAG in a typically low part of the season. That along side cost cutting." But BHP Billiton came under some selling pressure. The miner under shareholder pressure to simplify its structure - and now, it's reported, to dump chief executive Andrew Mackenzie. Pearson shares, meanwhile, were up a mighty 15 per cent - on the promise of more cost cuts. And if the US earnings season continues to surprise, the mood in Europe should stay upbeat. (SOUNDBITE) (English) LCG SENIOR ANALYST, JASPER LAWLER, SAYING: That has been the theme and we're looking at double digit earnings growth in USA and continue with some of the big companies reporting next week. You know I think that bodes well for overall market sentiment." After hitting fresh 20 month highs, the STOXX 600 was on track to end the week up more than 1 percent. German blue chips have been at record highs and France's CAC at its highest level in more than 9 years - despite a fraught second run-off to its presidential election.

The event also marked the 60th anniversary of the190th in the Kansas Guard and the 70th birthday of the United State Air Force. (Chris Neal/The Capital-Journal) Pete Melby, the crew chief for the A-10 Warthog from Whiteman Air Force Base, talks about the aircraft during Saturday afternoon’s celebration of the 190th’s 50 year anniversary at Forbes Field. The event also marked the 60th anniversary of the190th in the Kansas Guard and the 70th birthday of the United State Air Force. (Chris Neal/The Capital-Journal) A C-17 sits on the far end of the tarmac at Forbes Field as people begin to filter in for Saturday afternoon’s celebration of the 190th’s 50 year anniversary at Forbes Field. The event also marked the 60th anniversary of the190th in the Kansas Guard and the 70th birthday of the United State Air Force. (Chris Neal/The Capital-Journal) Ellis Turbiville, 2, and Elijah Turbiville, 4, got to sit in the pilot’s seats of three different military planes Saturday. The boys went with their mother, Starlynn Turbiville, to a public event held on the tarmac at Forbes Field Air National Guard Base. The experience will give Ellis and Elijah “a way to connect” next time they see a plane in the sky, said family friend Lettitia Bernard. “Now they’ll have a grasp of what one looks like up close,” she said. Bernard and the Turbivilles were among those who attended an anniversary open house hosted by the Metropolitan Topeka Airport Authority and the 190th Air Refueling Wing of the Kansas Air National Guard. Saturday’s celebration commemorated the 70th anniversary of the U.S. Air Force, the 60th anniversary of the Kansas Air National Guard and the 50th year of the 190th being based at Forbes. The event fit in nicely with the Air Force’s tradition of “serving its community, state and nation” because it marked separate anniversaries of service to Topeka, Kansas and the United States, said Capt. Joe Blubaugh, of the 190th. Saturday’s celebration began at 3 p.m. It was scheduled to run through 9:30 p.m. while featuring live bands and an evening fireworks show. Blubaugh said those present could look at static displays of planes that included a Boeing KC-135 Stratotanker, Boeing C-17 Globemaster, Lockheed C-130 Hercules, Douglas C-47 Skytrain, Lockheed T-33 Shooting Star and Fairchild Republic A-10 Thunderbolt II. The A-10, commonly referred to as a “warthog,” was flown here from Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri, said its crew chief, Pete Melby. A design featuring a warthog adorned the front of the A-10, which Melby said is used for close air support of friendly ground troops, as well as combat search and rescue. “It’s not a pretty plane, but it’s very effective,” he said. The A-10 present Saturday at Forbes goes by the name “War Horse” and has been flown in campaigns in Iraq and Afghanistan, Melby said. War Horse has saved the lives of ground troops on many occasions, he said. “This airplane is the ground troops’ best friend,” Melby added. He said he enjoyed going with the plane to public events such as Saturday’s to meet people and tell them about the plane. Saturday’s activities included flyovers about 2 p.m. by a Northrup B-2 Spirit, also known as a Stealth Bomber, and later by a KC-135. The Stealth Bomber went over at a time when guard members were visiting with family members but the public wasn’t yet being allowed in.

This is being designed to replace the Russian-made engine the U.S. has relied on for decades. (Courtesy photo) By Sandy Mazza, Daily Breeze Posted: 05/06/17, 1:50 PM PDT | Updated: 2 hrs ago # Comments Aerojet Rocketdyne's AR1 rocket engine, which recently completed a successful preburner test. This is being designed to replace the Russian-made engine the U.S. has relied on for decades. (Courtesy photo) Preparing for a 2019 liftoff, Aerojet Rocketdyne has fired up the workhorse rocket engine preburner of its new AR1 — a machine it hopes will replace the Russian thruster that now ferries astronauts into orbit. The liquid-engine maker, based in El Segundo and Sacramento, is building much of the massive 500,000-pound thrust motor in Canoga Park. The AR1, conceived in 2014, is designed to replace the Russian RD-180 that the U.S. relies on for most national-security space missions. The successful hot-fire of the preburner last week in Mississippi means the company is still on track to deliver the equipment by the congressional deadline to develop an American-made Atlas V rocket-booster engine in two years. High performance, lower cost The AR1 uses modern technology to provide a lower-cost alternative to prior U.S.-made rocket engines, as government and commercial spaceflight contractors rush to match the much-lower launch costs achieved by Hawthorne-based SpaceX. “From a U.S. perspective, this is going to be a very affordable engine,” said Tom Martin, Aerojet Rocketdyne’s senior manager for strategy and business development. “Russian labor costs are significantly lower. Our intent is to make sure the ULA (Atlas V) rockets are affordable. “This would be the first time the U.S. has ever done a full-scale engine using a staged-combustion cycle (propelled by) liquid oxygen and kerosene.” Aerojet Rocketdyne officials said they have been able to cut costs significantly with the AR1 because of the company’s patented nickel-based metal alloy, and 3D printing technology. “(The AR1 is) more efficient, and it can be smaller, but delivers the same thrust,” Martin said. “We’ve been working on 3D printing for over a decade.” As SpaceX wins more and more government launch contracts, it’s siphoning business from Atlas V’s maker, legacy aerospace launch provider United Launch Alliance. ULA is a partnership between Lockheed Martin Space Systems and Boeing Defense, Space & Security. Boeing has undergone a series of layoffs since 2016. ULA announced at least 71 layoffs since March from its Vandenberg Air Force Base location on the Central Coast, among hundreds of other layoffs expected this year. Competing U.S. engines Aerojet Rocketdyne won a $115 million U.S. Air Force contract last year to develop its AR1 for ULA’s Atlas V. The engine must be versatile, extremely reliable and tough. But the AR1 isn’t the only American-made game in town. Commercial rocket-maker Blue Origin is also promoting its competing BE-4 engines for the Atlas V. Advertisement When the time comes, Congress will have to choose between the two. Blue Origin, run by billionaire Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos, got financial support from ULA to develop the BE-4. While BE-4 is set to release this year, AR1 won’t finish all flight-ready testing until 2019. “BE-4 is the only engine that can fly by 2019, meeting the congressionally mandated deadline to eliminate dependance on Russian-built engines,” according to Blue Origin’s website. “The alternative engine (AR1) option is multiple years behind and could not be integrated into a launch vehicle until at least 2021.” But Aerojet Rocketdyne officials say they will be ready by 2019. The company touts its demonstrated history of powering U.S. government space missions over the newer commercial rocket maker. Its RS-68A engine lifts ULA’s Delta IV booster off the ground with 702,000 pounds of thrust. Also, Aerojet Rocketdyne’s RL10 engine is used in both the Delta IV and Atlas V second-stage rockets that deliver astronauts and payloads to specific orbital addresses. Aerojet Rocketdyne is promoting its stellar launch success record in hopes of wooing Congress away from the BE-4. “Our proven design process and demonstrated manufacturing approaches are key contributors to (the company’s) unmatched record of mission success,” said Aerojet Rocketdyne CEO Eileen Drake. “When replacing the Russian-made engines on current launch vehicles, mission success has to be the country’s number-one priority.” Click here to subscribe to Digital & Home Delivery - 50% off About the Author Reporter covering Carson, Hawthorne, Hermosa Beach and the environment.

This Week in Seattle: Your weekly dispatch of need-to-know news from the Emerald City. (BigStock Image) Seattle takes first steps toward an income tax Councilmember Lisa Herbold is pushing for a Seattle income tax. (Seattle City Council Photo) The Seattle City Council unanimously approved a motion that establishes a timeline to begin consideration of an income tax bill by May 31, with a goal of passing the legislation by July 10. The motion includes few details about what the income tax would look like, but city lawmakers have repeatedly said that it will target Seattle’s wealthiest residents and spare ordinary working people. The law will almost certainly be challenged in court, as Washington state’s constitution forbids local jurisdictions from imposing an income tax. [MyNorthwest.com, GeekWire] Is the West Coast ‘the most powerful opposition party’ to Trump? Pulitzer prize winning author Thomas Friedman thinks so. In a column for The New York Times this week, he argues California has far better odds in the fight against President Donald Trump’s agenda than the Democrats, due to the state’s dominant role in the U.S. economy. California’s booming technology industry, agricultural dominance, and liberal politics give it considerable weight in the ring with the president. Friedman makes a strong case, without even considering what might happen if Washington and Oregon — which also boast strong high-tech and agricultural industries and left-leaning electorates — joined the fight. [The New York Times] Key Arena renovation proposals go public Both proposals to renovate KeyArena would retain the building’s iconic roof. (Flickr photo via jpellgen). Seattle Mayor Ed Murray is asking for public feedback on two proposals to renovate KeyArena in the hopes of bringing NBA and NHL teams to the city. Both proposals are online and the city is accepting public comment from the community here. City staff will host a public open house May 11 to address questions residents might have. [GeekWire, Seattle P-I] An ‘omnibus’ of pot legislation awaits the Governor’s signature (Photo via Flickr/HUS0) The Washington state legislature passed a fatty of a marijuana bill over to Gov. Jay Inslee at the close of the regular session. The so-called “omnibus bill” reforms a wide range of cannabis-related laws in the state. If signed, it would instruct the Washington State Liquor and Cannabis Board to study the possibility of legalizing home growing, allow medical cannabis users to buy pot plants and seeds directly from producers, create a certification program for organic growing, expand the number of pot dispensaries retailers can operate to five, legalize industrial hemp production, and place new restrictions on advertising pot on billboards. Also, it’s apparently been illegal to puff, puff, pass in Washington this whole time. The bill would undo a state law that prohibits sharing of pot with anyone, even if all parties are of age. [The Stranger] This item has been updated with the correct contents of the omnibus bill. It would not legalize home growing but would begin studying the possibility of allowing residents to grow cannabis.

The three-day festival is attempting to become the Pacific Northwest’s answer to South by Southwest — bringing together artists and technology leaders for a conversation about innovation and music. The event will also include a startup showcase highlighting Seattle companies in digital media. Meanwhile, as Upstream approaches, some local artists are petitioning Allen’s Vulcan to develop the Central District in a manner that will keep the neighborhood affordable to local artists.  [Seattle Weekly, GeekWire] Olympia considers linking Boeing tax breaks to number of employees Boeing has approved the first wave of voluntary layoffs for union workers. (GeekWire Photo) Washington state lawmakers have floated two bills that would tie Boeing’s tax breaks to its workforce. If passed, Boeing would need to employ a minimum of 70,000 workers in the state to maintain its current tax rate. The rate would increase if Boeing’s employees drop below that number. Dropping below 70,000 employees would also dramatically decrease a tax credit the company has been able to claim in the past. Any money the state would receive as a result would go toward funding education. The bills are gaining traction due to ongoing layoffs from the aircraft maker.

(NASDAQ: AAPL) added $5.31 last week (3.7%), posting a new 52-week high on Friday. The company remains the best-performing stock by a wide margin among the 30 equities that comprise the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA). The company’s stock is up 28.61% year to date, well above second place Boeing’s 18.84% improvement. Apple reported earnings last Tuesday. Earnings per share of $2.10 and revenues of $52.9 billion were mostly in line with estimates of $2.02 in earnings per share and $52.97 billion in revenues. In the same period last year, Apple reported earnings per share of $1.90 and revenues of $50.56 billion. Apple shipped nearly 51 million iPhones in its second fiscal quarter, down by 430,000 year over year, but revenue was up from $32.86 billion to $33.25 billion. iPad shipments and revenues dropped while unit sales and revenues from Mac sales both rose. Services revenues rose by more than $1 billion year over year. Analysts uniformly maintained Buy ratings and some raised their price targets. Check out our full review of analyst action, but here are a few highlights: Merrill Lynch reiterated a Buy rating and $155 price target. Credit Suisse reiterated a Buy rating and $170 price target. BTIG kept its Buy rating and raised its price target from $165 to $184. Cowen kept its Buy rating and raised its price target from $155 to $160. Apple shares closed at $148.96 on Friday, in a 52-week trading range of $89.47 to $148.98. The consensus 12-month price target is $148.95 in a price target range of $104 to $185 per share. Last week’s changes may not all be included in the consensus yet.

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    China successfully completed the first test flight of its home-built modern passenger jet, bolstering President Xi Jinping’s ambition of turning China into an advanced economy. Amid cheers from onlookers, the C919 airliner took off Friday from Pudong International Airport in Shanghai, the home base of its builder Commercial Aircraft Corp. of China Ltd., or Comac. The jet landed back about an hour and 19 minutes later after cruising at 3,000 meters (9,840 feet). The single-aisle plane, which is designed to seat as many as 174 people, is slated to enter commercial service with China Eastern Airlines Corp. in 2019. “It shows China made a historic breakthrough in its years-old dream of building a big aircraft,” Comac said in a statement, calling the test a “complete success.” The nation’s State Council, the top administrative authority, sent a congratulatory note to the designers. The test flight, after repeated delays, marks another step in Xi’s ambitious ‘Made in China 2025’ program, which identified aerospace among sectors that could accelerate China’s advancement. The government has said the ability to build and fly a large commercial aircraft is the “flower’’ and “pearl’’ of modern manufacturing.  The C919 would be the first major competitor for Airbus SE and Boeing Co. in the most popular sector of the airliner market and gives Comac a home advantage in what is set to become the world’s biggest aircraft market. Boeing estimates China will need 6,810 aircraft worth more than $1 trillion in the two decades through 2035. “There’s a lot riding on the C919,’’ said Xu Yongling, a military test pilot and a member of the Beijing-based Chinese Society of Aeronautics and Astronautics. “The expectation for the C919 is not to become the best-selling single-aisle aircraft in the market, but rather become a stepping stone for COMAC to build something better, with indigenous technology.’’ VIP Guests COMAC plans to make six planes for tests, and the second one is getting ready at the final assembly workshop in Shanghai, the builder said. Guests who witnessed Friday’s test flight included Vice Premier Ma Kai and Han Zheng, Communist Party secretary from Shanghai. The five people on board the test plane were the captain, co-pilot, an observer and two engineers. Getting into the major league with Airbus and Boeing may be a few decades away as customers typically prefer aircraft with proven track record, reliability and safety, analysts said. COMAC is seeking certification for the C919 from European agencies. “Comac could well be an option for us,” said William Walsh, chief executive officer of IAG SA, the owner of British Airways Plc, adding he’d only seriously consider the plane when IAG reviews its existing fleet of short-haul Airbus A320-family jets in the long-term. More immediately, he’s expecting lower prices from the added competition. Walsh, a former pilot who’s flown in the plane’s simulator, said he’s due to meet with Comac next month to further advise on features that IAG looks for in a new model.  “A new entrant will have an impact on pricing,” Walsh told analysts on a call Friday. “We’ve seen that to some degree with the launch of the CSeries. It’s something that both airlines and the manufacturers are aware of.” The C919 designation was chosen partly to reflect the idea of long life in Chinese numerology. With a maximum range of 3,450 miles, the plane is powered by two LEAP-1C engines from CFM International Inc., a joint venture between Safran SA and General Electric Co. Other key system suppliers include Honeywell International Inc., Rockwell Collins Inc., Liebherr-International Deutschland GmbH, Thales SA and Panasonic Corp. To read a story on how the Chinese plane is made with U.S. technology, click here. The test flight of the plane follows China’s launch last month of its first domestically built aircraft carrier. The milestones, coming within weeks, burnish Xi’s credentials as a modernizer before he presides over the ruling Communist Party’s twice-a-decade congress later this year. Almost a billion people will fly to, from or within China by 2025, the International Air Transport Association estimates. Over the next two decades, about 75 percent of the jets ferrying those passengers will be single-aisle -- a category dominated by Boeing’s 737 and Airbus’s A320 family. To read David Fickling’s column on the C919, click here. In an email, Boeing congratulated Comac for the “successful development” of the C919, while Airbus said it welcomes competition, “which is good for the development of the industry.” Comac, which had postponed the test flight at least twice, says it has commitments from 23 customers for about 570 planes, with Shanghai-based China Eastern lined up to take the first delivery. Next Aircraft Richard Aboulafia, an aerospace analyst at Teal Group, said China may have to wait till its next aircraft to really break the duopoly for jets that can carry more than 100 passengers. “At the moment, they are in a real replication mode, which is not where you want to be,” he said. “First off, they need to privatize and open their supply chain up to a global network, rather than just people who will transfer yesterday’s technology.”  Comac has set its sights on building a wide-body aircraft. It is forming a joint venture with Russia’s United Aircraft Corp. to develop a twin-aisle jet. “The C919 is a testament to China’s civil aviation research and manufacturing capability,” said Yu Zhanfu, executive director at Roland Berger Management Consultants Shanghai Co. “China’s had a lot of success in making rockets, making spaceships. It shows the country is capable of mega tech-intensive manufacturing projects.” © Copyright 2017 Bloomberg News. All rights reserved.

The real estate lobby has grown massively since the day Trump testified in front of that House of Representatives committee. In 2016, the industry pumped nearly $104 million into federal lobbying — more than the securities and investment industry, which includes the bulk of Wall Street interests apart from the major banks. The industry’s biggest spender — the National Association of Realtors — was second only to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce in total spending by any company or group from any industry between 1998 and 2016, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan research group that tracks money and lobbying in politics. NAR, which has 1.1 million members, spent a massive $416 million on its reported lobbying during that time. By comparison, the megafirm General Electric shelled out $345 million, the defense contractor Northrop Grumman dropped $243.4 million, and Boeing and Exxon Mobil ponied up $242.9 million and $232.2 million, respectively. Despite NAR’s might, the real estate industry still doesn’t have the same kind of presence in Washington as other major industries — like big oil, telecom and health care. But sources say that’s largely because real estate is less consolidated, with stakeholders ranging from residential developers to commercial landlords to mortgage players to the big banks, among others. (Click to enlarge) Real estate did not make the Center for Responsive Politics’s Top 10 list for lobbying dollars spent between 1998 through 2016. But its spending is on the rise. The $104 million it spent in 2016 was a record, up 26 percent from a decade earlier. “While overall lobbying has been declining, real estate for whatever reason has kind of been increasing since they recovered from the collapse,” said Daniel Auble, a senior researcher at the nonprofit. Real estate lobbyists said that in addition to targeting Congress, they’ve also recently been focusing more on federal agencies. Bill Killmer, the chief lobbyist for the Mortgage Bankers Association — which has more than 2,000 corporate members — said the push to lobby agencies on mortgage finance issues started before the passage of Dodd-Frank, which was signed into law under President Barack Obama in 2010 and designed to increase regulation on the unwieldy banking industry after the financial crisis. “I used to say our regulatory folks were drinking through a fire hose on a daily basis because there was so much interaction we had to have with the alphabet soup of regulators,” Killmer said, referring to the dialogue about the changing rules. “I think we tried to maintain a pretty even balance [between agencies and Congress].” Now, with one of their own in the Oval Office, many in the industry are hoping for an onslaught of pro-real estate changes and more face time with the president or his surrogates. Sources say Bill Rudin and several other New York developers recently met with Ivanka Trump and White House economic adviser Gary Cohn in Washington. So far, however, much of the access has come not at the White House but at the president’s private club Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, where he’s hosted friends and real estate titans Richard LeFrak, Howard Lorber, Bruce Toll and others. In addition to having Trump in the White House, the fact that both the Senate and House are controlled by Republicans means that the legislative environment for most major real estate issues hasn’t looked better in years. “The House has passed a lot of legislation that didn’t go anywhere in the Senate that may go somewhere now,” said Ken Trepeta, president of the Real Estate Services Providers Council, a national industry lobby. “Some things that weren’t possible in the last eight years are now possible,” added Trepeta, who helped write the Mortgage Choice Act, which falls under the Financial Choice Act. Last month, Texas Republican Jeb Hensarling — chairman of the House Financial Services Committee — reintroduced the Financial Choice Act, a bill designed to roll back Dodd-Frank that was shelved in December. The new version even more severely strips it of its regulatory teeth. But reforms to Dodd-Frank — along with tax reform, the reauthorization of the EB-5 program, infrastructure spending and more — took a back seat to President Trump’s failed push to repeal Obamacare and his controversial (but ultimately successful) nomination of Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court. With the administration now moving on from those matters, real estate-related reforms are next. Below is a rundown of some of the key issues that the real estate lobby is watching and mobilizing on. Tax reform When President Ronald Reagan and his Senate allies pushed to raise taxes in the early 1980s, the real estate lobby was relentless. “They have been camping on our doorstep,” said then-Sen. Bob Dole, the legendary Kansas Republican. “They have been in the gallery. They have been in the lobbies. They have been in the elevators.” The lobbyists’ persistence paid off: The real estate industry managed to hold onto a slew of special tax breaks. But the victory was short-lived. A few years later, in 1986, tax reform rose to the top of Congress’s priority list, and real estate tax shelters — which had exploded in popularity between the late 1970s and early 1980s, in part because of changes made to capital gains taxes — became a key target. Although no concrete numbers exist, Wall Street Journal reporters Alan Murray and Jeffrey Birnbaum wrote in their 1988 book “Showdown at Gucci Gulch” that the money stashed away in tax shelters in the U.S. jumped to $20 billion from $2 billion during that time. Tax shelters became a go-to mechanism for filling developers’ capital stacks because they allowed investors to offset their tax burdens while investing in real estate. But when Congress eliminated many of those tax shelters as well as deductions for passive-investment losses, real estate investment dropped off, industry sources say. Today, with tax reform at the top of Trump’s agenda, industry players all agree on one thing: Never let 1986 happen again. “I was here in 1986,” said Cindy Chetti, lobbyist for the National Multifamily Housing Council, a prominent landlord group, “and many of us remember what the outcome of the tax reform effort was and the problems it created for the commercial real estate industry.” That’s why the prospect of any major tax overhaul — even one backed by a developer-in-chief — has the entire real estate lobby on alert. The Trump administration and House Republicans have called for sweeping changes to taxation, leaving concerns that tax benefits for real estate investments — including 1031 exchanges, carried-interest deductions, the mortgage-interest deduction and the low-income housing tax credit — might get axed (or altered) in the hunt for extra revenue. (Click to enlarge) The Real Estate Roundtable — a consortium of real estate trade associations with close ties to the Real Estate Board of New York — and NAR are already emerging as two of the industry’s leading lobbyists on tax reform. In January, the Roundtable released its Trump-era policy agenda, touting 1031 exchanges, which allow investors to defer tax payments when they reinvest the proceeds from the sale of one property into another. A preliminary “blueprint” proposed by the House Republicans last year was silent on 1031 — as was the tax plan announced late last month by the Trump administration. Real estate sources contend that the elimination of the exchanges would have devastating effects on New York City’s investment sales market because they incentivize sellers to buy new properties, thereby generating more business. The halls of Congress will be crowded with lobbyists from the broader business world vying to make their tax priorities known. And at the top of many of their agendas is something else: the corporate income-tax rate. The Trump administration has called for the current rate of 35 percent to be dropped to 15 percent. The new rate would apply not just to large corporations, but also to smaller businesses and pass-through entities such as LLCs, which are used widely in commercial real estate. In their blueprint, House Republicans proposed lowering the rate to 20 percent for corporations and 25 percent for pass-throughs. But without increasing the federal deficit, it will be hard, if not impossible, to make across-the-board tax cuts unless revenue is raised elsewhere. John Bryant of the Building Owners and Managers Association International — an organization whose members oversee 10 billion square feet of commercial property in the U.S. — said the group is staying focused on the final outcome. “The response we’re getting when we’re talking to the tax-writing committees is ‘Don’t just look at the individual parts … if you look at the end game, it will actually be a wash or you may actually come out better,” he said. Although Bryant and others are still advocating for the tax breaks that currently benefit the industry, as long as the overarching math works out for them, they’re keeping an open mind. “We’re not drawing a hard line in the sand,” Bryant said. Dodd-Frank Just the mention of Dodd-Frank gets stakeholders on both sides of the political aisle riled up — with opponents arguing that it saddles the banking industry with too many restrictions and cripples the economy, and proponents saying it’s badly needed to protect the public from the loosely regulated banks that prompted the 2008 financial crisis. Trump has blasted the legislation, vowing on the campaign trail to “dismantle” it. In February, the president signed an executive order directing his Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, a former hedge funder and Goldman Sachs executive, to evaluate the Dodd-Frank-created Financial Stability Oversight Council and report back within 120 days on whether it’s acting in line with his goals for a less-regulated economy. “We expect to be cutting a lot out of Dodd-Frank, because frankly I have so many people, friends of mine, that have nice businesses and they can’t borrow money,” the president said in a February meeting with business leaders who included Stephen Schwarzman, CEO of the fund manager Blackstone Group. While Dodd-Frank is targeted squarely at the banking industry, it is inextricably tied to real estate lending — from residential mortgages to construction loans to investment dollars. And for the industry, Dodd-Frank will be one of the biggest legislative battlegrounds. Lobbyists, especially in the commercial sector, are carefully strategizing as they assess the rules — some of which have only very recently gone into effect. Meanwhile, Hensarling’s new bill — which would ease regulations on mortgage lending as well as reduce the “risk retention” burden on banks that requires them to keep extra capital on their books — addresses real estate players’ concerns. But Democrats argue that the bill will put millions of consumers at risk.  Whether Hensarling’s bill moves forward or not, risk retention will undoubtely be under the microscope for the real estate industry. At the moment, it requires banks packaging commercial mortgages into sellable securities to keep 5 percent of those loans on their own books. Two of the most prominent real estate lobbying groups taking on Dodd-Frank are the Commercial Real Estate Finance Council and the Mortgage Bankers Association, which are focused on the commercial and residential components of the legislation, respectively.  David Motley, the chairman-elect and president of the mortgage group, recently said the regulations have “reduced the availability and affordability of mortgage credit for many American families.” Marty Schuh — the senior director and head of government relations at CREFC, who was a staffer for Republican Sen. Bob Corker when Dodd-Frank was being hashed out — said the legislation incited confusion because the procedures for implementing it were unclear. “We had all kinds of little fights, about what the value of par,” Schuh said, referring to disputes while the legislation was being drafted about how various portions of it would be interpreted. Major bank heads including JPMorgan Chase’s Jamie Dimon are not seeking to repeal the entire bill, but to instead to “open it up” and reassess. “I’m not someone for wholesale ‘throw it all out,” Dimon told Bloomberg in January. But he added that “no one in their rational mind could say everything that was done and how it was done was done right.” He cited liquidity-ratio requirements for banks as well as operational risk capital — both of which dictate how much money banks need to keep on hand — as areas for potential change. But risk retention in general is complicated for many lobbying groups. CREFC represents both CMBS buyers and sellers and has a less hawkish stance than might be expected. While it might have technical issues with the way the rule functions, it’s not opposed to risk retention generally. “CREFC always supported the idea of skin in the game because we are ultimately driven by the buy side — they’re the keys to this being a successful market,” Schuh said. Some sources argue that the importance of these regulations to the success of the current market is overstated. (Click to enlarge) “While the regulatory environment is playing a role in some kinds of lending, concerns about pricing and where we are in the market cycle are also significant factors,” said Sam Chandan, an associate dean of NYU’s Schack School of Real Estate. Still, much of the home lending industry argues that aspects of Dodd-Frank have limited the ability to extend debt. The Consumer Finance Protection Bureau — a body created by Dodd-Frank — issued a slew of new regulatory guidance, including Dodd-Frank’s qualified mortgage rule, which tightens banks’ discretion in deciding who qualifies as a “good faith” borrower.  Killmer, of the Mortgage Bankers Association, said that above all he’s “arguing for regulatory clarity.”  “We’re not necessarily trying to blow up all those systems, we’re trying to see if there are ways to improve them.” Affordable housing To get a sense of how affordable-housing construction might be shaken up by Congress, lobbyists and stakeholders need to trace the history back to 1986 — again. That’s when, after cracking down on tax shelters — a move that led to a drop in multifamily investment — lawmakers designed a dollar-for-dollar tax break known as the low-income housing tax credit, or LIHTC in industry-speak. Developers win the credits from the state, get them from the IRS and then sell them on an open market. In 2015, the LIHTC market raised about $13 billion in equity, according to the accounting firm Novogradac & Company, which tracks the market. These tax credits have become a crucial incentive for any developer in the affordable-housing space. Without them, sources say, many affordable residential projects don’t pencil out financially. Bob Moss, director of government affairs for the New York-based accounting firm CohnReznick, said that although he’s concerned, the program’s wide popularity in Congress makes him hopeful that LIHTC will not be on the chopping block. “We’ve been invited in by the Ways and Means tax staff to start talking about financial models that would maintain the low-income housing tax credit production … should corporate rates be lower,” said Moss, whose firm does extensive work in affordable housing. “We have very much been at the table,” he added. “We have not felt like we’re on the menu.” But with the expected drop in corporate taxes, prices for these credits are already falling. That’s because a drop in corporate tax rates means those who are buying these credits have less tax liability to offset. And that means less demand. Still, many affordable-housing advocates are not overly worried about LIHTC, and there’s even talk of expanding the number of available credits. In March, Sen. Maria Cantwell, a Democrat from Washington state, introduced legislation — which already has bipartisan support — to expand the number of available credits by 50 percent. Other affordable-housing programs may not be so lucky. The White House budget office released its proposal for the Department of Housing and Urban Development in March, which included a massive $6.2 billion slash in spending. The move was backed by Trump’s HUD Secretary Ben Carson, a neurosurgeon who ran against Trump in the GOP presidential primary and has, until now, never held a government position. The White House’s budget blueprint also proposed abolishing Community Development Block Grants, which are widely used in New York to help fund code enforcement, building inspections and even emergency repairs to some privately owned buildings if a landlord refuses to rectify a safety issue. National affordable-housing groups like the National Low Income Housing Coalition and the National Housing Conference are now busy making their case for why Trump’s unprecedented cuts to housing would be detrimental to the American poor. “These proposed cuts are unacceptable, and Congress must soundly reject them,” Diane Yentel, president of the National Low Income Housing Coalition, wrote in a letter after the White House announced its intentions. “There’s already close to a $30 billion capital-needs backlog in public housing across the country,” Yentel told The Real Deal in an earlier interview. National Housing Conference President Chris Estes, meanwhile, told his members to prepare “for ongoing, coordinated advocacy for housing and community development. This is a marathon, not a sprint.” GSE reform Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac — public companies known as government-sponsored enterprises — guarantee trillions of dollars in American mortgages. The two GSEs, which were created to expand the nation’s secondary mortgage market, were hemorrhaging money amid the subprime mortgage crisis and were bailed out to the tune of a stunning $187 billion by the federal government. In September 2008, with President George W. Bush in the White House, they were placed into government conservatorship. At the time, the Washington Post described the move as “one of the most sweeping government interventions in private financial markets in decades.” But most agree that having the government in control of Fannie and Freddie’s books is not sustainable. Treasury Secretary Mnuchin has said Americans should expect GSE reform sometime during the Trump administration. Although Trump does not have a public stance on GSEs, in late November Mnuchin called for a swift end to “government control” of Fannie and Freddie. He later clarified that he’s not looking to abolish them. In February, Cohn, Trump’s economic advisor, told reporters that Mnuchin has been “spending a lot of time” on GSE reform and described it as an “early” priority. But Jamie Gregory, the chief deputy lobbyist for NAR, said he expects the issue to take a back seat to tax reform for now. “We’ll see legislation introduced and we’ll see hearings this year, but I think ultimately it’s far more likely a bill passes next year,” Gregory said. NAR, along with the rest of the national real estate lobby, wants to ensure that whatever GSE plan moves forward, U.S. mortgage lending remains robust. The Federal Housing Finance Agency — which oversees Fannie and Freddie — has warned that the two GSEs are at risk of needing another bailout if something doesn’t change soon. Fannie’s capital buffer is on track to hit a big fat zero in early 2018, at which point it will need to hit up the U.S. Treasury. Freddie, meanwhile, started 2016 with a $354 million loss. Yentel, of the National Low Income Housing Coalition, said one reason the Treasury would be on the hook is because Fannie and Freddie’s current structure prevents them from holding too much capital. “The agreements they have … ensure that the capital buffers of Fannie and Freddie are ever-declining,” Yentel said. “That increases the likelihood that Fannie and Freddie will need a draw from the Treasury.” The coalition and other affordable-housing groups will be lobbying to keep the so-called National Affordable Housing Trust Fund intact. That fund is financed by Fannie and Freddie, but if the GSEs need to tap the Treasury, they can’t pay into the trust. “The longer we go without some resolution … the more at risk the trust fund is of having its contributions suspended,” Yentel said. Infrastructure and EB-5 One of the biggest real estate policy issues on Washington’s docket is the massive public infrastructure plan Trump has been dangling. On the campaign trail, Trump said he wanted Congress to authorize a $1 trillion plan to improve the nation’s bridges, roads, tunnels, airports and other public infrastructure, like electrical grids. “We’re talking about a very major infrastructure bill of a trillion dollars, perhaps even more,” Trump said last month. Details have been scant since he’s taken office. Before he was elected, his economic advisers released an infrastructure plan that relied mostly on incentivizing private investment. His administration is reportedly considering up to $200 billion in federal spending along with tax breaks, MarketWatch reported. While doing something about infrastructure, in the most general sense, is one point of bipartisan agreement, Democrats largely want the $1 trillion to come from the government, not private investors. Most of the real estate lobby is in favor of increased infrastructure spending. Assuming the federal government does not fund all of the public projects, they could get a boost from another key target on the real estate lobbying agenda: the EB-5 visa program, which is up for reauthorization this year. The 25-year-old program — which awards foreign investors green cards for investing cash in job-producing projects — is set to expire this year, though it got a last-minute temporary extension late last month. Renewing it permanently requires Senate and House approval. But the program is controversial, to say the least. Opponents say it unfairly awards wealthy foreigners who can pay their way into the country, and argue that it’s too vulnerable to fraud and abuse. The Obama administration proposed new regulations for EB-5 — such as raising the minimum investment threshold to nearly $1.4 million for visas from $500,000. Those proposals have not gone over well with the industry, which is devoting time and money to push for reauthorization with as few changes as possible. Trump has remained silent on the issue. However, his real estate scion son-in-law, Jared Kushner, now his senior advisor, used EB-5 funds to help pay for the construction of a 50-story luxury rental tower in Jersey City known as, you guessed it, Trump Bay Street. White House spokesperson Hope Hicks told TRD Kushner would recuse himself from all EB-5 matters. The program has, of course, been a go-to funding spigot for NYC luxury real estate developers, but it’s also recently been used to help fund public projects like the George Washington Bridge Bus Station redevelopment and wireless internet infrastructure in the city subway. EB-5 has been routinely renewed for years without substantial reforms, but a sizable bloc in Congress sees little merit in the program at all, and momentum against it has grown. Texas Republican Louis Gohmert — an outspoken member of the House Judiciary Committee — has called for suspending the program entirely. “Give us your immoral, your degenerate, as long as they have money,” he quipped at a hearing in March. “The message is we want them in America, and we’ll give them a visa to get their money.” Short URL Print Popular WeWork, Rhone Group raise hundreds of millions for property investment fund The view from Mt.

LOUIS -- A St. Louis jury has awarded a Virginia woman a record-setting $110.5 million in the latest lawsuit alleging that using Johnson & Johnson's baby powder caused cancer. The jury ruling Thursday night for 62-year-old Lois Slemp, of Wise, Va., came after three previous St. Louis juries awarded a total of $197 million to plaintiffs who made similar claims. Those cases, including the previous highest award of $72 million, are all under appeal. About 2,000 state and federal lawsuits are in courts across the country over concerns about health problems caused by prolonged talcum-powder use. Slemp, who was diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2012, blames her illness on her use of the company's talcum-containing products for more than 40 years. Her cancer has spread to her liver. Although she was too ill to attend the trial, an audiotape of her deposition testimony was played. In it she said: "I trusted Johnson & Johnson. Big mistake." Jim Onder, one of her attorneys, said Friday that Slemp was "thrilled" when the verdict was shared with her in a phone call and that she hoped it would "send a message." He said she was too sick to talk to reporters. Johnson & Johnson, based in Brunswick, N.J., said in a statement that it would appeal and disputed the scientific evidence behind the allegations. The company also noted that a St. Louis jury found in its favor in March and that two cases in New Jersey were thrown out by a judge who said there wasn't reliable evidence that talc leads to ovarian cancer. -- The Associated Press Ford lays off 130 workers at Ohio plant Ford Motor Co. has temporarily laid off 130 workers at its plant in Avon Lake, Ohio -- jobs it had hoped to preserve by moving production there from Mexico in 2015. The automaker is taking the truck plant down to one shift to match output with slower customer demand, a spokesman said in an emailed statement. The layoffs extend a pattern of widespread shutdowns planned for the summer as carmakers adjust to the U.S. auto market's recent slowdown after seven years of gains, even as President Donald Trump paints a more upbeat picture. "Even though incentives are up, you're seeing some production being taken out," Mark Wakefield, managing director and head of the automotive practice at consultant AlixPartners, said in an interview this week. "That shows some people are not assuming this is a speed bump or a plateau and there's things to be adjusted." The layoffs mark a turnaround for Ford, which had moved production of its commercial F-650 and F-750 trucks from Mexico to Ohio and used the decision to deflect criticism from Trump during the campaign. Ford has since announced it has scrapped plans for the $1.6 billion small-car Mexico facility and will build the Focus compact in an existing plant there. The laid-off employees are expected to return to work this fall, the spokesman said. -- Bloombreg News China-built jetliner has 1st test flight SHANGHAI -- China's commercial aerospace dreams took wing Friday as the first Chinese-built passenger jetliner completed its first public flight test, embodying the country's ambitions to take on industry champions Boeing and Airbus. With a brisk breeze blowing through light smog under overcast skies, a crowd of government officials and aerospace executives gathered to watch as the C919, white with a green-and-blue striped tail, underwent a lengthy preflight check, then rumbled down a runway and into the sky for a test flight that lasted about an hour. The aircraft landed safely, and Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China Ltd., its manufacturer, declared it a success. The C919 is years behind aircraft made by Airbus and Boeing, and safety regulators in Europe, the United States and elsewhere still have to certify the plane before it can be sold outside China. Including parts such as the engines, its cockpit and its belly, the C919 is filled with gear made by Western industrial companies. -- The New York Times Fannie Mae to pay $2.8B profit to U.S. Fannie Mae said it expects to make a $2.8 billion dividend payment to the U.S. Treasury in June after reporting a first-quarter profit driven by a relatively stable mortgage market and a continued decline in delinquencies. The payment will come after the mortgage-finance giant reported net income of $2.8 billion for the first quarter, according to its earnings release on Friday. The profit was an increase from the $1.1 billion the Washington-based company posted a year ago, but a significant decline from the $5 billion it reported for the fourth quarter of 2016. Fannie Mae, the Federal National Mortgage Association, said its income declined from the fourth quarter mainly because interest rates were relatively flat between January and March, while they increased significantly in the fourth quarter of last year. The company and McLean, Va.-based Freddie Mac, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp., have been under U.S. control since the 2008 financial crisis. They received $187.5 billion in taxpayer aid to sustain them before they returned to profitability. The current terms of their bailouts require them to turn over virtually all profits to the Treasury, and the money doesn't count as repayment for the government's aid. Freddie Mac said on Tuesday that it will pay $2.2 billion in June after reporting a first-quarter profit. With next month's payments, the two companies will have returned about $271 billion to taxpayers. -- Bloomberg News Safety agency probing Nissan complaints DETROIT -- The U.S. government's highway safety agency is investigating complaints that the brakes can malfunction on some Nissan SUVs. The inquiry covers about 110,000 Muranos from the 2009 model year. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said in documents posted Friday that 58 drivers complained about the problem. One reported a crash with three injuries. The complaints allege that the brake pedal loses pressure, causing increased stopping distances. The problem happens after braking on a low-friction surface such as a manhole cover. Some drivers reported that the pedal went to the floor. In some of the complaints, drivers reported that the anti-lock brake hydraulic control unit was replaced, which apparently solved the problem. -- The Associated Press Business on 05/06/2017 Print Headline: Award $110.5M in baby-powder lawsuit Ford lays off 130 workers at Ohio plant China-built jetliner aces 1st test flight Fannie May to pay $2.8B profit to U.S. Safety agency probing Nissan complaints Tweet ADVERTISEMENT More Business ArcBest reports loss of $7.4M; revenue up 5% ...

(Andy Bronson / The Herald) Local gymnast has big goals at Junior Olympic Nationals Nick Patterson Fri May 5th, 2017 10:42pm Sports You must sign in or register to continue reading content. Ashley Albrecht is determined to go out with a bang. The Leading Edge Gymnastics Academy member and senior at Cascade High School is representing Leading Edge for the final time this weekend when she competes at the 2017 Junior Olympic National Championships in Indianapolis. Because of that, Albrecht is motivated to do something special. “I’m super excited,” she said prior to departing for Indianapolis. “This is my fourth (national championships) and I have goals that I hope to make.” Albrecht has been a member of Leading Edge since she was 4 years old, so nearly her entire life has been spent at the gym that is now located near Boeing in south Everett. She’s been the club’s shining star, reaching nationals each of the past four years. Following nationals, she gets ready to depart for the University of Illinois at Chicago, where she has a full scholarship to compete in gymnastics. “It’s pretty rare that you find a gymnast who is pretty fearless and comes in every day with a smile on her face,” Albrecht’s coach, Casey Rigby, said. “It’s a very rare thing, so her personality will be missed next year when she goes to college.” But Albrecht wants to leave Leading Edge with one final memento before she departs — a podium finish at nationals. Albrecht heads to nationals full of confidence. The powerhouse tumbler qualified by winning the Level 10 all-around at the 2017 USA Gymnastics Region 2 Championships on April 7-9 in Boise, Idaho. At regionals she dominated her division, not only winning the all-around with a score of 37.300, but also finishing first on the vault (9.525), the balance beam (9.400) and in the floor exercises (9.625). “I performed well on every event but (uneven) bars,” Albrecht said of regionals. “But I was pleased with my other three events. “I thought my floor routine was my best,” Albrecht added. “I stuck all my tumbling passes and just sold my routine.” Now it’s off for a fourth bite at Level 10 nationals. Albrecht made progress in each of her previous trips to the national stage, cracking the top 10 in her division last year when she finished 10th in the all-around with a score of 37.675. This year, she doesn’t just want to take another step, she wants to make a leap. “My goal is to score a 38 and place in the top five,” Albrecht said. “I was in the top 10 last year, which is pretty good for me, and I was close to a 38.” Albrecht has an additional advantage upon reaching the national stage: her temperament. Most gymnasts at major events remain tense and nervous during competition. Not Albrecht. Her coaches marvel at the way she remains loose and goofy in even the tensest of competitive circumstances. “It seems stressful, but it’s really not,” Albrecht said of performing in the pressure cooker of nationals. “It’s actually quite calming sometimes. I know all the numbers that I put into practice (25 hours a week year round) help me to perform.” But will it be enough to help her reach her goal of finishing in the top five this weekend? “I think she’s very capable of being in the top five,” Rigby said. “Nationals is every gymnast in the country, every Level 10 in the country competing for this huge title. So getting on the podium is a huge deal, and I think top five is well within her reach.” And if Albrecht is able to pull it off, it will be the perfect ending to what’s been a storied career with Leading Edge.

A one-off masterpiece of engineering designed and built during the 1980s in the waning days of the USSR. The aircraft, designated the An-225, is the biggest to ever grace the Earth. It’s so large that the length of its cargo hold is longer than the Wright brothers’ first flight, from take-off to landing. Now 30 years old, and recently upgraded to give it another 20 years’ service, the plane rarely takes to the skies anymore. Instead, it sits stagnant under an enormous steel arch. However, a crew of dedicated Antonov employees still periodically tend to the An-225. Its sporadic use has nothing to do with its age. It’s grounded because there is simply little demand for its highly specialised and relatively costly service. Although the plane, nicknamed ‘Mriya’ (‘Dream’) in Ukrainian, is in fine condition, there are very few jobs that call for something so large . And the jobs need to be urgent; if you want to use the An-225 it will cost around $30,000 (£23,220) an hour. In 2016, it spent just three months traversing the globe on two lengthy deployments. The remainder of the time, it sat here at the Gostomel airport, once a top-secret flight testing airfield for Antonov. Originally built as a transport for the Soviet Union’s Buran space shuttle, the An-225 was forced to find new purpose as a cargo carrier after the USSR collapsed, says Alexander Galunenko, the first man to fly the plane. “When the USSR collapsed, the programme was shut down and the financing was closed as the need for this plane vanished,” says Galunenko. He first flew the An-225 on 21 December 1988, after over a decade’s service as a Soviet test pilot. Galunenko fondly remembers the bewilderment of first taking the behemoth across the world to visit the United States. “We were invited to an aviation show in Oklahoma and the media reported that the largest aircraft in the world was coming so that attracted a mass of people,” he says. “All of these people just assumed that the largest aircraft in the world was made by the Boeing company. We had to tell them it was made by Antonov, and they asked, ‘Where is Antonov from?’ We said, ‘It’s a company in Kiev’, so they asked us, ‘And what is Kiev?’ Well we told them ‘Kiev is in Ukraine’, and of course they asked, ‘But what is Ukraine?’” The navigator of the flight eventually pulled out his maps and began to point out Ukraine to the many curious visitors. “He took a marker and circled Kiev to show them where it is,” laughs Galunenko. “We got to show our plane and give the Americans a geography lesson too.” The An-225 in pictures: Up close with the world’s largest plane The plane is effectively an extension of its little brother, the An-124 ‘Ruslan’ – an aircraft rarely regarded as “little”, seeing as it’s the largest military transport in the world. From a room adorned with scale models of every aircraft the company has built in its 71-year history, the lead engineer of the An-225 project, Nikolay Kalashnikov, tells BBC Future that he spent his entire professional life working for Antonov. But it was building the Mriya that was the pinnacle of his career. “Today it’s hard to tell, but back then it was so impressive. It was just so difficult to imagine that such a big machine can fly,” says Kalashnikov. Although the An-124 Ruslan was already an impressively sized cargo carrier at that time, Kalashnikov and his team set about modifying the structure to increase its maximum takeoff weight. They added two engines, rows of landing gear, extended the fuselage and redesigned the tail in order to meet the most important requirement, which was to ensure that the Buran space-shuttle and the Energia booster rocket could slide off the plane midflight and take off into space. “It was possible to carry everything, the shuttle and all the elements of the rocket on the back of the aircraft,” says energetic CEO of Antonov Airlines, Mikhail Kharchenko, from his office at the Gostomel airport. “The idea hasn’t gone away. The United States is now working on an air-start programme.” At that time, the USSR’s space missions were run from what is now southern Kazakhstan, at the Baikonur Cosmodrome. So the AN-225’s mission was to bring the booster rockets from Moscow and ferry the Buran itself to Baikonaur. They calculated that the AN-225 programme would be cheaper than building a freeway across two rivers and through the Urals just to move these parts, says Kalashnikov. Kharchenko believes that the Mriya still has huge potential, despite its age, and it’s not just for its enormous cargo capacity. He thinks there’s still the chance to develop the An-225 into a proper in-air launch platform. “Approximately 90% of the energy of the launch vehicle is spent getting up to an altitude of 10km (6.5 miles) ,” says the CEO. “If we take some spacecraft and put it on the Mriya’s back and fly it up to a height of 10km, then we can launch it into space from there. From the point of view of cost, the economic benefit is huge if you launch from a height of 10km.” He admits it’s still going to take a little bit of refinement, but Kharchenko believes this is the best direction for his company’s flagship aircraft. And he’s not the only one. In 2016, the Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AICC), a Chinese state-owned aerospace and defense company, signed a cooperation agreement with Antonov for the An-225 program. If it goes through as planned, the skies could soon be flooded by a fleet of Chinese built An-225s. “The initial idea and early stage research of the An-225 started in 2009,” the president of AICC, Zhang Youshengtells BBC Future. “The official contact with Antonov began in 2011, and then from 2013 to 2016 was the acceleration phase of this project.” The Chinese company isn’t interested in purchasing the existing airworthy An-225. They have spent the past several years studying the feasibility of modernising the only other An-225, an unfinished airframe that has sat inside a hangar at Antonov’s giant corporate campus in downtown Kyiv for the past 30 years. This aircraft, when modernised, could give China a heavy lift capability that surpasses any other nation in the world – perhaps even greater than that of the US military. According to Zhang, the An-225 would be the centrepiece of a hyper ambitious plan to add 1,000 heavy lift aircraft over the next 10 years. Heavy lift is not the only capability they’re after though. “The An-225 can be equipped with spacecraft to high altitude, and can launch commercial satellites at any height below 12,000m,” Zhang tells the BBC. “Its launch time is flexible, accurate, and can quickly send the satellite into intended orbit, which greatly reduces launch costs.” The Chinese are aiming to make their way into the lucrative satellite launch industry, which doubled revenue from 2006 to 2015, according to figures provided by AICC. The purchase agreement for the existing An-225 airframe is similar to China’s acquisition of an aircraft carrier hull from Ukraine nearly 20 years ago. That hull, originally commissioned by the Soviet Union, was rebuilt and modernised over two decades until it was declared ‘combat ready’ by China’s military in November 2016. If the plan goes forward, the Mriya will have found new life flying the skies for China’s AICC, but Ukraine will have lost of a small but symbolic part of its aerospace industry. The men who built the plane have mixed feelings about the prospect of losing the programme to the Chinese. “The Chinese want to buy from us this plane and there’s no harm in it, but of course no one wants to sell the aircraft,” says Kalashnikov. “The Mriya is not separable from Ukraine, it’s like our child, and it’s something our children, and our grandchildren can always be proud of.” Join 800,000+ Future fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter.

[Photo/Xinhua]  The C919, China’s first homegrown large passenger plane, made its debut flight on Friday in Shanghai, a breakthrough in the country’s innovation and manufacturing drive and a change to the landscape of the global civil aviation market. The successful test flight of the C919 comes only nine days after the country debuted its first homegrown aircraft carrier in Dalian, Liaoning province, showing the world its manufacturing prowess, development of advanced technology and national ambition to regain past glory. After the flight, which lasted about 79 minutes at an altitude of 3,000 meters and an average speed of 300 km/h, the plane returned to Shanghai Pudong International Airport, from which it had taken off at 2 pm. “All the activities made in the air are normal. The C919’s debut flight is a complete success,” said Cai Jun, captain of the flight. In a letter of congratulation to the C919 project, the State Council said: “The successful maiden flight of the C919 marks a milestone for China’s aviation industry. The project carries great weight and importance to the country’s innovation drive and manufacturing upgrade push. “It is also a shot in the arm for the ongoing supply-side reform,” the letter said. “The large passenger aircraft flying in the blue sky makes generations of Chinese people’s dream come true.” About 3,000 people witnessed the historic moment of the first flight of the narrow-body jetliner. Before the flight, the C919, whose enhanced version has a range of 5,555 kilometers, passed a series of strict tests after rolling off the assembly line in November 2015. Zhou Guirong, deputy chief designer of the C919, said more than 50 percent of its parts and components were domestically made, either by Chinese companies or joint ventures in China. Since launching the C919 project, the plane’s research team has made 102 technological breakthroughs in areas including integrated design of engines and systems control. With 158 to 174 seats, the twin-engine, single-aisle aircraft will be used for medium-haul commercial flights. The State-owned Commercial Aircraft Corp of China, which manufactured the C919, has received 570 orders for the C919 from23 clients. According to its designers, the commercialization of the C919 will take two to three years before getting certification from the Civil Aviation Administration of China. Boeing earlier predicted that China will need 5,110 new single-aisle airplanes through 2035. With China’s aviation market growing rapidly as a rising middle class travels more for leisure and business, the C919 aircraft is also expected to eventually take market share from Boeing and Airbus in the lucrative narrow-body market, which accounts for more than 50 percent of the aircraft in service worldwide. “We believe the C919 will bring new competition to the market, and we welcome com-petition, which is good to the development of the industry,” said Eric Chen, president of Airbus Commercial Aircraft China. Kevin McAllister, president and CEO of Boeing Commercial Airplanes, expressed his congratulations on behalf of Boeing for the C919’s successful debut flight. “This is a great achievement in the history of COMAC and an important milestone for Chinese aviation,” he said. Federico Marziali, head of quality management of Dornier Seawings GmbH, said he is very impressed by the size of the COMAC C919 project. “I can imagine the huge production ability once it starts production, by the size.” Meanwhile, Lin Zhijie, an aviation industry analyst and columnist at Carnoc.com, one of China’s largest civil aviation web portals, said there is still a long way to go before the C919 enters the market. “Apart from meeting flight safety standards, the C919 team has to make sure all things go right, such as the reliability, fuel efficiency, maintenance cost, as well as the comfort level of the aircraft. They should all be considered before it is put into use in the market,” Lin said. The C919 project was launched in 2006. Two years later, the C919 maker COMAC was established in Shanghai. Plans for the plane, which was originally due to fly in 2014 and be delivered to buyers in 2016, were postponed for manufacturing reasons.     Print       Email Published: 1 min ago on May 6, 2017 By: Foreign Affairs Publisher Last Modified: May 6, 2017 @ 3:10 pm Filed Under: Asia Pacific, Asia Pacific Region, Business, China, China State Council Information Office, Economics, English, Internet Communications Technology, Manufacturing, MIL OSI, Open Source Intel, Peoples Republic Of China, PRC State Government, Technology NEXT ARTICLE → Air China inaugurates Barcelona-Shanghai direct flight ← PREVIOUS ARTICLE EU pushing Britain towards nationalism About the author Foreign Affairs Publisher View all articles by Foreign Affairs Publisher » Recent Posts EU pushing Britain towards nationalism C919 takes wing, marks milestone Air China inaugurates Barcelona-Shanghai direct flight Sandstorm expected to hit south West Lake patrol officer saves lives, smartphones © 2017 ForeignAffairs.co.nz.

Ed Lazowska of the University of Washington takes home the Geek of the Year award at the 2017 GeekWire Awards. (GeekWire Photo / Kevin Lisota) The University of Washington’s fingerprints were all over last night’s GeekWire Awards. Two of the Deal of the Year finalists, Impinj’s IPO and Turi’s $200 million acquisition by Apple, have ties to UW. Ed Lazowska, the longtime UW computer science professor who is spearheading the campaign for a second computer science building that will double the capacity of the program, took home this year’s Geek of the Year award. And one of his fellow nominees was Connie Bourassa-Shaw, who spent nearly two decades building UW’s entrepreneurship programs and announced plans earlier this year to step down. RELATED: GeekWire Awards 2017: Photos, videos, tweets and more from our annual celebration of NW tech Lazowska came up again later in the show, when Microsoft’s Project Catapult took home the award for Innovation of the Year. Andrew Putnam, principal research hardware design engineer at Microsoft Research, called out Lazowska for being “one of many reasons why I came to the University of Washington computer science program.” “We kept it around UW and kept it local,” Putnam said of his project. “Now we are changing the world. I hope you guys can use our AI and cloud platform for your next innovations.” Lazowska has been with UW since 1977, and he has been instrumental in the rise of the university’s computer science program, transforming it into a top-tier destination for aspiring computer science students.   Computer science is now the most in-demand major at UW, surpassing business. In addition to the new building, Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen recently made a $40 million contribution, combined with an additional $10 million from Microsoft in Allen’s honor, to create a $50 million endowment for a new Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering at the UW. In addition to his win at the GeekWire Awards, Lazowska was honored today at the Technology Alliance luncheon in downtown Seattle. He received a standing ovation after he was introduced by UW President Ana Mari Cauce. He has been a “tireless, selfless champion” for technology and computer science in Washington state for the past 40 years, Cauce said. Lazowska has on the Tech Alliance board for the past 20 years — “uniting business, research and education leaders around the importance of computer science to our very much innovation-driven economy,” she said, touting his new status as Geek of the Year. Lazowska spoke to GeekWire at the awards last night — just before hopping on his bicycle to head to his Ballard home — and talked about the growth of the school over the years, how he stays connected to the Seattle tech scene and the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead. The conversation has been edited for style, length and clarity. Paul G. Allen (center) discusses a new $50 million endowment to create the Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering with Hank Levy (left), Wissner-Slivka Chair in Computer Science & Engineering and director of the new school, and Ed Lazowska (right), Bill & Melinda Gates Chair in Computer Science & Engineering at the UW. GeekWire: How important has this year been for computer science at UW? Ed Lazowska: I’ve been here 40 years, and every year has been better than the one that came before. I say to people when I moved here, technology was Boeing making planes, and Fluke making voltmeters, and Physio-Control making defibrillators. Microsoft was 13 people in Albuquerque. Now you guys talk about 86 engineering offices of companies headquartered elsewhere that are here, in addition to all our great homegrown companies. What I love is graduating more fantastic students every year and seeing them out there, doing great. Obviously this year getting our new building under way was really important, and then the Paul G. Allen School is super important. Those are both the biggies for me, because they are the future. The new building doubles our capacity, and the Allen School is just monumentally important. Partly, it’s just being associated in perpetuity with Paul, one of the greats, somebody who is a real visionary – an ‘Idea Man,’ as the book says. To be joined at the hip with him for the future is important, and the program being a school at UW is important. It elevates our status. GW: How do you continue to foster relationships with the Seattle tech scene as new companies come to town and homegrown companies grow?  We spent 50 years making things smaller and faster and less expensive, and now we are going to spend 50 years attacking societal challenges. EL: Part of it is just personal, individuals working with individuals. UW has been very liberal in allowing relationships with companies. We have two faculty members who are essentially half-time at the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence, in addition to Oren Etzioni, who has left our faculty to run it. Why do we do that? If Paul Allen can do for artificial intelligence what he did for brain science, this is going to be transformational for Seattle and for us, so for gosh sakes go do it. We have a faculty member at Facebook now, doing face type stuff. The students create these relationships for us. We stay in very close touch with the students here and in the Bay Area. We have this Industry Affiliates meeting once a year, it’s sort of a small company and startup recruitment day, then a research day, then a major company recruiting day. Long ago, 20 years ago, we elected to set the price of membership incredibly low, and the reason is, we decided it was more important to focus on friend-raising than fundraising. Here we were in Seattle, with this incredible wealth of small companies headquartered here, and we decided that getting them in and connected was the important thing. I think connection to the community has always been really important to us. The planned UW Computer Science & Engineering Building. (LMN Architects Rendering) GW: What changes do you see in computer science education going forward? EL: It’s the recognition of computer science as central to everything, and that’s really important. It’s not just software, it’s biology, you name it, computer science is at the center of it. We spent 50 years making things smaller and faster and less expensive, and now we are going to spend 50 years attacking societal challenges. Whether it’s healthcare or transportation or energy efficiency or education, whatever you care about, you better care about computer science because we are central to tackling all of those things, and that’s a really important change in the nature of the field. There’s plenty of stuff still making things smaller and faster and cheaper, but it’s now really affecting people’s lives in ways that go far beyond a word processor or printing your paycheck. You look at what is happening in AI these days, and you look at the potential of deep learning, autonomous vehicles, and things like that. It’s utterly mind-boggling. GW: What does UW have to do to maintain its presence in the tech community as more companies come here? EL: We are a community here. It is astonishing the amount of support we get. What we have to do as a university, as a computer science department, is stay connected to that community. That’s really the strength. I am working hard to transition to others a certain amount of that connectivity that has traditionally been me. And I am a control freak, so I am not very good at bringing others along to take on my responsibilities, and that’s terrible. You should be judged on the succession plan you put into place, less by what you did and more by how things continue afterwards, so I am trying to be really serious about that now, partly because of lectures from friends. Those relationships need to belong to UW Computer Science and Engineering, the Paul G. Allen School, not to Ed. That’s the challenge: Making sure I cement the relationships between all these people and institutions and companies in the community to the Paul G. Allen School, so that it doesn’t matter if I am there or not. University of Washington’s Ed Lazowska and Connie Bourassa-Shaw catch up prior to the 2017 GeekWire Awards. (GeekWire Photo / Kevin Lisota) GW: What do you see as the biggest challenges for your programs in the coming years? EL: We all know that universities do research, but fundamentally we are in the education business, and we are in the education business for Washington state’s kids. And scaling is very difficult, because when we get funded for enrollment expansion we take students right away, and it takes forever to hire the faculty. That’s because it is a dog-eat-dog world for the best people. And we are fighting with Stanford and Berkeley and MIT and Carnegie Mellon and basically nobody else, so it is pretty fast company.   I am completely infatuated with my Echo. We use it for all sorts of stuff, and it’s great. I think it’s phenomenal how right Amazon got this, by having it do a limited set of tasks in a way it could perform with 100 percent accuracy. The rate at which we can grow the faculty is far less than the rate at which we can grow the student body, and now the question is, how do you keep the educational quality up when class sizes are large? This quarter we have 200 undergraduate teaching assistants in our program, so astonishingly, a significant portion of our undergraduate student body is involved in teaching other undergrads. It’s how we are making up for the lack of faculty. So the challenge is keeping the quality up so that Microsoft, Amazon, Google, Facebook and the startups want to hire these students, and doing that in this period when we are not in steady state. The students are coming in, and the faculty is coming in much more slowly. It’s a nationwide problem. Two years ago there was a graduate machine learning-course at Stanford with 760 students in it. You don’t go to Stanford to sit in a classroom with 760 graduate students – give me a break! Ed Lazowska at the 2017 GeekWire Awards. (GeekWire Photo / Kevin Lisota) GW: What is a piece of tech you can’t live without, and not just something simple like a smartphone or email? EL: I am completely infatuated with my Echo. We use it for all sorts of stuff, and it’s great. I think it’s phenomenal how right Amazon got this, by having it do a limited set of tasks in a way it could perform with 100 percent accuracy. Two years ago, it was so great to be able to say “Alexa, turn on Christmas,” and suddenly all the outdoor lights go on. It’s like the greatest stupid pet trick in the world. I’ve told people at Amazon that their mistake was selling Echos so cheaply and not investing in the companies that make Z-Wave switches and outlets, because I probably spent $2,000 refitting all my outlets and switches in my home, and I didn’t spend anything on my Echo because somebody gave it to me. Had I bought it, it would have been at 10 percent of what I spent on Z-Wave switches. We also are like the last people on earth to have bought a Roomba. We don’t have kids at home anymore. We don’t have pets. But still, it’s amazing how much crap this thing picks up. The first few times we ran it, my wife and I would spend an hour following the damn thing around the house watching what it was doing. It’s incredibly cool. It’s not like this is AI rocket science, but it’s a very sophisticated device that does a great job. These things that are part of your daily life are what’s really going on now, and it’s super exciting.

[Photo/Xinhua] What you need to know about the C919 Debut flight hailed as making a Chinese 'dream come true' The C919, China's first homegrown large passenger plane, made its debut flight on Friday in Shanghai, a breakthrough in the country's innovation and manufacturing drive and a change to the landscape of the global civil aviation market. The successful test flight of the C919 comes only nine days after the country debuted its first homegrown aircraft carrier in Dalian, Liaoning province, showing the world its manufacturing prowess, development of advanced technology and national ambition to regain past glory. After the flight, which lasted about 79 minutes at an altitude of 3,000 meters and an average speed of 300 km/h, the plane returned to Shanghai Pudong International Airport, from which it had taken off at 2 pm. "All the activities made in the air are normal. The C919's debut flight is a complete success," said Cai Jun, captain of the flight. In a letter of congratulation to the C919 project, the State Council said: "The successful maiden flight of the C919 marks a milestone for China's aviation industry. The project carries great weight and importance to the country's innovation drive and manufacturing upgrade push. "It is also a shot in the arm for the ongoing supply-side reform," the letter said. "The large passenger aircraft flying in the blue sky makes generations of Chinese people's dream come true." About 3,000 people witnessed the historic moment of the first flight of the narrow-body jetliner. Before the flight, the C919, whose enhanced version has a range of 5,555 kilometers, passed a series of strict tests after rolling off the assembly line in November 2015. Zhou Guirong, deputy chief designer of the C919, said more than 50 percent of its parts and components were domestically made, either by Chinese companies or joint ventures in China. Since launching the C919 project, the plane's research team has made 102 technological breakthroughs in areas including integrated design of engines and systems control. With 158 to 174 seats, the twin-engine, single-aisle aircraft will be used for medium-haul commercial flights. The State-owned Commercial Aircraft Corp of China, which manufactured the C919, has received 570 orders for the C919 from23 clients. According to its designers, the commercialization of the C919 will take two to three years before getting certification from the Civil Aviation Administration of China. Boeing earlier predicted that China will need 5,110 new single-aisle airplanes through 2035. With China's aviation market growing rapidly as a rising middle class travels more for leisure and business, the C919 aircraft is also expected to eventually take market share from Boeing and Airbus in the lucrative narrow-body market, which accounts for more than 50 percent of the aircraft in service worldwide. "We believe the C919 will bring new competition to the market, and we welcome com-petition, which is good to the development of the industry," said Eric Chen, president of Airbus Commercial Aircraft China. Kevin McAllister, president and CEO of Boeing Commercial Airplanes, expressed his congratulations on behalf of Boeing for the C919's successful debut flight. "This is a great achievement in the history of COMAC and an important milestone for Chinese aviation," he said. Federico Marziali, head of quality management of Dornier Seawings GmbH, said he is very impressed by the size of the COMAC C919 project. "I can imagine the huge production ability once it starts production, by the size." Meanwhile, Lin Zhijie, an aviation industry analyst and columnist at Carnoc.com, one of China's largest civil aviation web portals, said there is still a long way to go before the C919 enters the market. "Apart from meeting flight safety standards, the C919 team has to make sure all things go right, such as the reliability, fuel efficiency, maintenance cost, as well as the comfort level of the aircraft. They should all be considered before it is put into use in the market," Lin said. The C919 project was launched in 2006. Two years later, the C919 maker COMAC was established in Shanghai. Plans for the plane, which was originally due to fly in 2014 and be delivered to buyers in 2016, were postponed for manufacturing reasons.

The passenger aircraft, which experts say could shatter the Boeing-Airbus duopoly in a few years, took off around 2:00 pm local time from Shanghais Pudong International Airport, was airborne 80 minutes and landed without reporting any problems. Hundreds of officials and guests witnessed the takeoff of the C919, which was built by the state-run Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC) in collaboration with some 200 companies from the sector and around 70 material and parts suppliers from several countries. Following repeated delays in construction and test deadlines, expectations were high ahead of the planes maiden flight. The fully-built jet ready for taxi tests was unveiled in November 2015, but its flight trial was delayed on numerous occasions until finally taking place Friday. During the flight, pilots said they conducted several tests successfully. The C901 is a narrow-body aircraft  similar to over half the commercial planes currently active worldwide  and can carry between 158 to 174 passengers, with a range of 4,075 and 5,555 kilometers (2,532 to 3,452 miles). Equivalent models manufactured by its main rivals and market leaders in the aviation sector are the Boeing 737 (United States), and the Airbus A320, headquartered in France. Following the C919s successful maiden flight, COMAC will be able to obtain the Certificate of Airworthiness (CofA) from the Civil Aviation Administration of China and other international regulators before making its first deliveries. COMAC has said a total of 23 national and international clients have placed orders for 570 C919 jets, construction on which is set to begin soon at a rate of 150 planes annually.   Enter your email address to subscribe to free headlines (and great cartoons so every email has a happy ending!) from the Latin American Herald Tribune:   RSS Feed [ Home ] [ About Us ] [ Who's Who ] [ Contacts ] [ Help ] Copyright Latin American Herald Tribune - 2005-2015 © All rights reserved
X Close Regional Home > News > Regional < Back to SMG 45 Saturday, 6 May 2017 Made-in-China passenger plane makes maiden flight SHANGHAI: The first large made-in-China passenger plane successfully completed its maiden test flight, marking a key milestone on the country’s ambitious journey to compete with the world’s leading aircraft makers. The narrow-body C919 jet – white with green and blue stripes – disappeared into the clouds after taking off from Pudong International Airport in the commercial hub Shang­hai as a crowd of thousands cheered. It landed some 80 minutes later. Built by state-owned aerospace manufacturer Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (Comac), the plane represents nearly a decade of effort in a government-mandated drive to reduce dependence on European consortium Airbus and US aerospace giant Boeing. The flight is the latest sign of China’s growing ambition and technical skill, coming one week after the country launched its first do­­mestically made aircraft carrier and docked a cargo spacecraft with an orbiting space lab. Before takeoff, CCTV state television said the plane would be tested at an altitude of 3,000m, some 7,000m lower than a regular trip, and at a speed of around 300kph. Top officials, Comac staff and company partners attended the inaugural flight, which was shown live on state television. China has dreamt of building its own civil aircraft since the 1970s, when it began work on the narrow-body Y-10, which was eventually deemed unviable and never en­­tered service. President Xi Jinping himself has endorsed the new project, visiting Comac even before he took office in 2013. The first flight was supposed to take place last year, but was delayed until now. The twin-engine C919, whose name sounds like the Chinese word for “everlasting”, can seat 168 passengers in an arrangement similar to other narrow-body jets: three white-velvet upholstered seats line each side of its central aisle. It has a range of 5,555km and has received 570 orders, almost all from domestic airlines. Comac made two planes for the test flight and it expects to produce four more by 2019, said Bao Pengli, deputy head of Shanghai Aircraft Manufacturing Co. – Comac’s production arm. The Shanghai-based firm plans to become one of the world’s leading civil aircraft manufacturers in the next three years, aiming to have the C919 and ARJ21, a smaller 90-seat regional jet made by Comac, both certified to fly internationally. — AFP Tags / Keywords: world Related Stories Related Stories There’s ‘snow’ business at N.

Leaping up onto his classy, bright red, David Brown 25D tractor, vintage expert George Farrar says "money couldn't buy this happiness". The 70-year-old machine - the same age as its sprightly owner - was originally bought by George's father, Samuel, in 1963. It was the first diesel tractor the Farrar family, from Abbeyshrule, Co Longford, had for threshing crops on small tillage and grazing farms in the area. Although it was bought for economical reasons at the time, rapid advances in machinery soon eclipsed the classic tractor which was left to brace the outdoor elements for decades. But, after months of careful restoration, George brought his father's tractor back to life and now describes it as "a family treasure". "Vintage machines all have their own special stories and I love learning their unique histories. "They were reliable machines and they are standing the test of time in ways that modern machinery will never achieve," said George, known countrywide for his exceptional skills at restoring time-honoured farm machinery. Debate rages after Gardai stop driver with 'overweight' trailer load of straw  Garda Traffic Corps from Cork North Division stopped this vehicle in Mallow, Co. Cork yesterday and kicked off a massive debate online about the legality of the drivers actions. Today, he says a new market for old vintage mowers is emerging nationwide - particularly finger bar mowers that have a certain knack for topping crops under fences. As the grandson of two blacksmiths, George says his fascination with machinery was ignited at an early age. "I was reared on tractors and mowers so it's in my blood. I always loved tractors, Fordson, Allis-Chalmers, Bamford, David Brown, machinery was always around our house. I couldn't wait to get out of school to get driving tractors," he said. At 14, George, the only person in Ireland that restores haybobs, started out honing his skills at his uncle's engineering works in Rathowen. "It was about 10 mile away, I cycled over and back for £3 a week. I was repairing machinery, making gates, any farm repairs," he said. After learning the ropes from his late uncle John, George landed a job as a welder at Providers Steel Fabrication in Longford at just 17. "I started working on bigger machines, ploughs, mowers and hay making machinery. We were busy all the time," he said. But, after a few short years, the talented and innovative craftsman, decided he wanted to be his own boss. In 1969, George and his brother, also named John, set up Farrar Brothers Body Builders at home in Abbeyshrule - near the birthplace of renowned novelist, playwright and poet Oliver Goldsmith. "We started building tipping trailers and body trucks for transporting cattle. We had people coming from all over the country, we had a cattle body in every county at one stage. It was big business," he said. However, his love for bringing vintage machines back to life was never far from his mind. He started officially collecting in 1984, when he bought a Fordson tractor. The father of three wasn't alone in his hobby. Farmers all over the Midlands were getting enthusiastic about vintage and so, George, and a few like-minded friends established Lakeland Vintage Club in 1984, which still holds annual shows in the region to this day, "Our shows put Abbeyshrule on the map. People came from all over the country. There was a great buzz about vintage. "I was going all around the country buying them and doing them up, I was even importing them from England," he said. "Back in the '80s fellas would come into our workshop at night to restore tractors, we had great craic. We all shared our experience with one another, each machine had its own history, there was a great social side to it," said George who is also known for his ploughmanship having competed in the All-Ireland competitions at the National Ploughing Championships for almost a decade. He also developed a keen interest in vintage planes having worked part-time as a flight instructor at Abbeyshrule Aerodome airport for 30 years. He trained many pilots who went on to captain Boeing Aer Lingus jets. Country music star Mick Foster was also one of his exemplary students. Economic crash As the economic crash started to grip the rural area located between the River Inny and the Royal Canal, George and his brother decided to close their body building venture in 2007. He says the vintage market took an immediate hit. However, he refused to give up. Looking out the window of his Scandinavian style cabin, in the heart of the village George beams with pride as he points to his colourful collection. "I've eight tractors and three mowers done up and 10 that I'm working on. Two tractors are both 70 year old and come from Ballymahon. They were within 200 yards of each other all their lives. "I have a Fordson from Galway, built in 1949 and a McCormick Deering from the 1930s that we rescued from under briars and nettles last year," he said. More than 50 years after learning how to repair old mowers, George, who has passed his trademark skills onto his nephew Clement, has noticed a surprising market revival. "We sold 16 finger bar mowers last year. Farmers are using them for topping under electric fences where the ordinary topper won't work. "Others are buying to expand their collection and see them in action," he said. George says vintage machines are invaluable to families. "There is a lot of sentimental value especially if a machine has been in a family for generations. Families must have the foresight to recognise that. For me, having my father's tractor means part of him is still here."

This is a spaceport NASA plans to build in lunar orbit, using the Orion and SLS launches over the next few years to construct it. The Gateway would be used as a waystation for deep-space missions, to Mars and beyond. Pat TroutmaN, A Space Architect at NASA Langley, is helping to manage the Deep Space Gateway project. This is a spaceport NASA plans to build in lunar orbit, using the Orion and SLS launches over the next few years to construct it. The Gateway would be used as a waystation for deep-space missions, to Mars and beyond. Tamara DietrichContact Reportertdietrich@dailypress.com NASA Langley helps managed Deep Space Gateway to help stage missions to moon, Mars and beyond The journey to Mars, the moon and other celestial destinations might soon have a deep-space port of call. In a few short years, NASA plans to have a Deep Space Gateway — a sort of small, orbiting pit stop — for astronauts to visit before they venture off on longer-duration missions. "A gas station without the tanks, basically," said Patrick Troutman, space architect at NASA Langley Research Center in Hampton. "It allows the crew to freshen up. It allows them to fix their vehicle. It allows them to go into the snack shop and get provisions and Coke and stuff. Fuel up." Troutman is oversimplifying, of course. But that's the gist. And NASA Langley is helping to get the gateway off the ground by reaching out to major commercial contractors in the space industry, evaluating their ideas for what the gateway should look like and how it should be built, then advising headquarters on the best path forward. When America's first astronauts arrived at newly renamed NASA Langley Research Center on April 27, 1959, they knew they were going to make history in outer space. But not until May did the center's scientists and engineers detail the training that would teach the Project Mercury pioneers how to do it. Go here to see the accompanying post. -- Mark St. John Erickson "So Langley's playing a pretty big role in this," said Troutman, who's part of NASA's NextSTEP program to extend humanity's reach into space. "We're not building it, we're not procuring it, but we're providing the common sense and the smarts that will make better decisions and a better system from a commercial investment perspective. "We used to call it the Deep Space Port, because it's where we're assembling our ships to go to Mars. But it's also a gateway to the solar system." William Gerstenmaier, associate administrator for Human Exploration and Operations at NASA headquarters in Washington, D.C., says it can be used in a variety of ways in different orbits to enable a range of missions. NASA Centennial Tribute tells STEM story through the arts Jonathan Black NASA Langley's centennial celebrations continue May 18 with a night of music and dance at the Ferguson Center. Free tickets for the NASA Langley Centennial Tribute are available Monday at 10 a.m. and officials expect them run out fast, according to Ann Marie Trotta, government affairs specialist... NASA Langley's centennial celebrations continue May 18 with a night of music and dance at the Ferguson Center. Free tickets for the NASA Langley Centennial Tribute are available Monday at 10 a.m. and officials expect them run out fast, according to Ann Marie Trotta, government affairs specialist... (Jonathan Black) "The gateway could move to support robotic or partner missions to the surface of the moon," Gerstenmaier says. "Or to a high lunar orbit to support missions departing from the gateway to other destinations in the solar system." Once operational, and once NASA's Space Launch System booster and Orion crew capsules are making annual launches, NASA says the gateway should become "a hub of activity." The gateway won't be nearly as big as the International Space Station, because it won't have crews living there for long periods of time and its purpose is entirely different. As planned, NASA says the gateway will have a small habitat, a power bus, docking capability, an airlock and solar electric propulsion. It will be built using existing technologies, which should help accelerate construction and control costs, and will be assembled in orbit by Orion crews. "We're not creating anything new," said Troutman. "It's going to be very off-the-shelf-type stuff." Because the gateway can be relocated in space, NASA can position it to overcome the competing forces of the Earth/moon gravity well, which means easier and more fuel-efficient launch points into deeper space. "That's an important thing," Troutman said. "The Earth is at the bottom of the gravity well, and it takes a lot to haul yourself from the Earth to Earth orbit. And it takes even more to haul yourself out to the very edge of the Earth/moon gravity system." In addition, within that cislunar space between the Earth and moon are libration points, or sweet spots where their vying gravities balance out. Those areas offer real advantages for science and exploration efforts. Libration point 1, or L1, for example, lies between the Earth and moon, far above synchronous orbit, and affords great views of both spheres. L2, on the other hand, is on the very far side of the moon. Because L2 is shielded from radio interference from Earth, Troutman said the gateway positioned there could conduct superior deep-space radio astronomy. That same libration point would also allow for better staging of vehicles to the moon or Mars. "That's what the gateway is for — it's to allow us to extend our reach and extend it in a flexible manner to cislunar space so that we can go on to the next stepping stone beyond that," Troutman said. The way it would work as a stepping stone is roughly this: Say a crew is heading to the Martian system. An Orion would launch from Earth on an SLS and taxi to the gateway. There, a reusable Deep Space Transport vehicle would be docked and freshly fueled, provisioned and refurbished. The Orion crew would transfer to the transport vehicle and head out on the 1,000-day trip. In a few years, when the crew returns from Mars, the transport vehicle would stop at the gateway to be refueled, refurbished and provisioned again for its next mission. And the returning crew would transfer to an Orion for the short trip home. The gateway could host a crew for 30 days, which could more than double the 21-day mission time of an Orion. While at the gateway, astronauts could run robots on the moon, aggregate lunar vehicles or refuel and configure a Mars transport vehicle. NASA is funding several commercial space companies to come up with gateway concepts — Bigelow Aerospace, Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Sierra Nevada Corp. and Virginia-based Orbital ATK. The final product could look like any one of their concepts or a combination. According to NASA, the first piece of the gateway, the power bus, could be delivered to lunar orbit by the first Orion crew in either 2021 or 2023. Assembly could finish up in 2026, and the following year the Deep Space Transport could arrive, followed by another Orion crew to inspect the systems. NASA's plan for now is to send a four-person Orion crew to a transport vehicle in 2029 for a yearlong shakedown mission, followed in 2033 by a two-year crewed mission to the Martian system. The Deep Space Gateway is a pivot, of sorts, for Troutman and Langley, which had been heavily involved in NASA's Asteroid Redirect Mission to land on an asteroid, retrieve a boulder and place it in lunar orbit for study. That ARM program was designed to test out new technologies for a Mars mission, and also learn more about asteroids to better protect Earth from strikes in future. But Trump has proposed zeroing out funding for the ARM program. "It was very disappointing for all of us here who worked on that program," Troutman said. "But we have to look at it this way: What the ARM did, we're still using big ideas from that, and technology that was to be involved in that, in Mars. The ARM is what gave us the stimulus to think about this reusable Mars architecture. When we started looking in detail about the trajectories to try to go out to an asteroid, grab a piece and bring it back — wow, this is very similar to the type of things you could do for a Mars mission." Space priorities can change from one president to the next. George W. Bush, for instance, wanted to return to the moon, then Barack Obama came along and scrapped the moon idea and turned instead to an asteroid and Mars missions. Donald Trump nixed the asteroid mission, but, so far, seems to like Mars. NASA believes the Deep Space Gateway is resilient enough to withstand such mission whiplash. "We chose this gateway concept because it allows us to go to any destination without having to change our plans," Troutman said. "So that's the genius of it. Depending on where we're going and what we're going to do, we can reposition the gateway to the right place. "We know that (if) we establish a foothold in cislunar space, we can go to the moon, Mars or even asteroids. It works for all of them. It even works for Venus. "We're not backtracking on anything that we've done in the past five or six years, no matter what the president says — unless he says don't send humans at all. But, given the president's recent remarks, he seems to be very much a person who wants to extend humanity's reach into the solar system. So we'll have to see what happens here. It could be a very interesting summer." Dietrich can be reached by phone at 757-247-7892.

Lieutenant General James H. “Jimmy” Doolittle was also a gentleman who rarely used harsh language, but when they gave him the battle order for a mission to be flown on February 3, 1945—a mission to Berlin—Doolittle reportedly uttered an expletive or two. The order told American bombardiers to use the Frederichstrasse Railway Station in Berlin as the aiming point for the day’s air assault on the Third Reich. To Doolittle, that sounded a lot like bombing a city. But Americans didn’t bomb cities. The British did that, at night. The Americans conducted high-altitude, daylight precision bombing of military and industrial targets, many of which, to be sure, were in the middle of cities. Doolittle felt he was being ordered to change U.S. strategy and betray American principle. The Eighth Air Force commander got on the phone with his boss, General Carl “Tooey” Spaatz, commander of Strategic Air Forces in Europe (and an immediate deputy of General Dwight D. Eisenhower). No transcript of the conversation exists, and Doolittle did not mention the conversation in an autobiography published decades later. But a staff officer remembers that hackles were raised and that Spaatz responded to Doolittle’s concern by telling Doolittle, in a not unkind way, to shut the hell up. Moreover, Spaatz reminded Doolittle that Berlin was not a new destination for American bombers and that legitimate targets lay within Adolf Hitler’s capital—Gestapo headquarters, the Air Ministry, railroad facilities, a panzer army on the move, etc. The report that Germany’s Third Panzer Army was en route from the Western Front to the Eastern and would pass through the railway station was in fact an error on the part of U.S. intelligence. No such movement was taking place. But the Red Army was within 130 miles of Berlin and a punishing aerial assault on the city was seen as a way to help the Soviets advance. A Big Day for the Eighth For the 650,000 men under Doolittle’s command—his Eighth Air Force was the largest aerial formation ever assembled—February 3, 1945, was to be one of the biggest days of the war. Doolittle was to dispatch 1,437 heavy bombers and 948 fighters to attack Berlin. The attack force consisted of 42 bombardment groups in three air divisions and 15,000 crew members. While 434 B-24 Liberators struck the synthetic oil plant at Magdeburg, 1,003 B-17 Flying Fortresses were to aim their bombs squarely on the city center of the capital of the Third Reich. At this late stage in the war, the German air force, the Luftwaffe, was no longer the formidable force it had been earlier in the air campaign. Unlike previous missions, this attack on Berlin received little coverage afterward because, for the most part, it lacked the high drama of air-to-air duels between Luftwaffe fighters and Flying Fortresses that had occurred earlier in the war. Yet the mission was both a turning point in U.S. strategy and a continuation (since 1942) of a kind of warfare that had never been seen before and would never be witnessed again, carried out on a scale that seems, today, almost too much to imagine. Generals gave orders. Young men carried them out. First Lieutenant Robert Des Lauriers, co-pilot of a Vega-built Boeing B-17G-75-VE (44-8629) named Purty Chili of the 391st Bombardment Squadron, 34th Bombardment Group at Mendlesham in East Anglia, was quietly focused on pulling his weight as part of a nine-man crew. (A waist gunner had been deleted from traditional 10-man crews in part because the Luftwaffe was no longer likely to attack a B-17 from both sides). Des Lauriers always surprised himself by being calm just after wake-up for a big mission. “We confronted the cold, the fog, the mist. We especially felt the cold. Asleep, awake, on the ground, in the air, we were always cold,” he said. Today’s journey into the cold, blue vastness above Europe was Des Lauriers’s 12th mission. Inside a B-17 in flight, it was so cold that Des Lauriers’s pilot forbade crew members from carrying drinking water since it would freeze and become useless anyway. Inside a B-17, men were going forth at, typically, 28,000 feet where, until this war, no one had done battle before. Inside a B-17 you needed oxygen to breathe and heated clothing to resist the sub-zero temperature and then, only then, you also needed to be able to fight. After they learned where they were going that day, Des Lauriers remembers a fellow crew member saying, “I hope we get Hitler today.” Pages 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 next › last » TweetShareShare Show full page View the discussion thread.

Saturday, May 6, 2017 Search Archive Chinese Chinese Japanese French Spanish Russian Arabic Korea German Portuguese HomeOpinionsBusinessMilitaryWorldSocietyCultureTravelScienceSportsSpecial CoveragePhotoVideo English>> Aircraft manufacturing to take off on C919 jet (Chinadaily.com.cn)    14:45, May 06, 2017 C919, China's homegrown large passenger jet, takes off on its maiden flight at Shanghai Pudong International Airport on Friday. [Photo by Gao Erqiang/China Daily] The successful maiden flight of the C919, a single-aisle homegrown passenger jet, is expected to provide a major impetus to the domestic airplane manufacturing industry. With more than 100,000 components for the plane, more than 240 local companies have served as suppliers and manufacturers for the C919 aircraft. Once the C919 plane starts mass production and delivery, it is expected to drive the rapid growth of the upstream and downstream industry chains and other high-end manufacturing sectors, such as metal materials, metallurgical processing and dynamic controls. Some cities, including Xi'an, Chengdu, Nanchang, Shenyang and Shanghai, have become involved in the production and assembly of the aircraft. All of them have formed aviation industry clusters and they are about to achieve faster development following the mass production of the C919, according to its manufacturer－the Shanghai-based Commercial Aircraft Corp of China Ltd. Harbin Hafei Industry Co Ltd, an aviation manufacturer in Harbin, Heilongjiang province in northeastern China, is mainly responsible for the manufacturing work of some parts that mainly use composite materials. These parts include the hatch door for the front landing gear, the hatch door for the main landing gear and the vertical tail of the C919. Li Wei, deputy chief engineer of the C919 project at Hafei, said: "Once the C919 aircraft starts large-scale production, it will effectively drive the output value of Hafei." Earlier, Hafei was mainly responsible for manufacturing helicopters. Despite its rich experience in airplane production, the company still faces a lot of technical challenges for the C919 plane. "The C919 aircraft has an advanced design concept, which makes it more difficult for manufacturing techniques. The manufacturing process for the plane has helped us significantly increase our experience and abilities in dealing with composite materials," she said. "Enterprises will be able to take a leading position in the fierce market competition, if they can grab the opportunities in the C919 project and supporting sectors," Li said. By 2030, the demand of single-aisle aircraft is expected to reach 14,500 worldwide and China has a demand of about 2,650, according to an industry forecast. Boeing earlier predicted that China will need 5,110 new single-aisle airplanes through 2035. After its maiden flight, the C919 will also launch a series of test flights, complete its technical verification tests and then enter the period of mass production and delivery in the next few years. So far, COMAC had received 570 orders for the C919 from 23 clients, including domestic airlines such as Air China, China Southern, China Eastern, Hainan Airlines and Sichuan Airlines. Overseas orders account for about 10 percent of the total, including airlines from Germany, Thailand and Africa.

State television said the jet would be tested at an altitude of 3,000 meters, which is 7,000 meters lower than normal flight, with a speed of about 300 kilometers per hour. The plane was originally scheduled to fly in 2014 and be delivered to buyers in 2016. It has been beset by delays blamed on manufacturing problems. If Friday’s maiden flight is successful, the aircraft’s maker, state-owned Commercial Aircraft Corp. of China Ltd., or Comac, will then seek certification from China’s civil aviation authority and foreign regulators. China is looking to reduce its dependence on Boeing’s 737 made in the United States and the Airbus A320 made in Europe. The country’s ever-increasing travel market is expected to surpass the U.S. market by 2024, according to the International Air Transport Association. The jet’s development is a key step on the path laid out by Chinese leaders to transform the country into a creator of profitable technology.

Bill Clinton super-fan Stern invited Hillary Clinton to go on his show, but he couldn’t even get a straight answer from the campaign about whether she would. Stern argues that for other celebrities, his male demographic reacts this way: “I ended up liking the person. … Jeez, I’m a big fan now,” and it seems reasonable to think that the same dynamic would have worked in Clinton’s case, to her advantage. So very, very many people tried to help Clinton, but unfortunately a higher power — Vladimir Putin — prevented her from taking Stern up on his offer.

About Lambert Strether Readers, I have had a correspondent characterize my views as realistic cynical. Let me briefly explain them. I believe in universal programs that provide concrete material benefits, especially to the working class. Medicare for All is the prime example, but tuition-free college and a Post Office Bank also fall under this heading. So do a Jobs Guarantee and a Debt Jubilee. Clearly, neither liberal Democrats nor conservative Republicans can deliver on such programs, because the two are different flavors of neoliberalism (“Because markets”). I don’t much care about the “ism” that delivers the benefits, although whichever one does have to put common humanity first, as opposed to markets. Could be a second FDR saving capitalism, democratic socialism leashing and collaring it, or communism razing it. I don’t much care, as long as the benefits are delivered. To me, the key issue — and this is why Medicare for All is always first with me — is the tens of thousands of excess “deaths from despair,” as described by the Case-Deaton study, and other recent studies. That enormous body count makes Medicare for All, at the very least, a moral and strategic imperative. And that level of suffering and organic damage makes the concerns of identity politics — even the worthy fight to help the refugees Bush, Obama, and Clinton’s wars created — bright shiny objects by comparison. Hence my frustration with the news flow — currently in my view the swirling intersection of two, separate Shock Doctrine campaigns, one by the Administration, and the other by out-of-power liberals and their allies in the State and in the press — a news flow that constantly forces me to focus on matters that I regard as of secondary importance to the excess deaths. What kind of political economy is it that halts or even reverses the increases in life expectancy that civilized societies have achieved? I am also very hopeful that the continuing destruction of both party establishments will open the space for voices supporting programs similar to those I have listed; let’s call such voices “the left.” Volatility creates opportunity, especially if the Democrat establishment, which puts markets first and opposes all such programs, isn’t allowed to get back into the saddle. Eyes on the prize! I love the tactical level, and secretly love even the horse race, since I’ve been blogging about it daily for fourteen years, but everything I write has this perspective at the back of it.

A US Central Command investigation found that a March US airstrike in northern Syria did in fact strike a building that was part of a “mosque complex,” two US defense officials told CNN Thursday. For days following the March 16 strike, the Pentagon adamantly rejected the notion that a mosque was hit and that there were civilian casualties — even as numerous social media reports showed images of bodies being taken out of the rubble. This admission seems to have been triggered by the release of a Human Rights Watch report in April. US airstrike on Syria mosque that killed nearly 40 was ‘likely unlawful’ “Adequate precautions” to avoid civilian casualties were not taken by American authorities before they dropped two bombs in western Aleppo on 16 March. “The US seems to have gotten several things fundamentally wrong in this attack, and dozens of civilians paid the price,” said Human Rights Watch’s deputy emergencies director Ole Solvang.

Of course, now that this lying has been exposed, a full investigation will result in the court martial of at least one, if not several officers above the rank of general…. OUCH!!! I hurt myself laughing…. Reply ↓ expat May 5, 2017 at 11:11 am What are the differences between so-called “terrorists” and the US? Terrorists claim they intend to kill civilians while the US either says “whoops” or says “War is hell.” Terrorists kill thousands of Americans which is murder. The US kills hundreds of thousands (millions?) of Muslims which is simply statistics. Terrorists don’t have nifty uniforms and billion dollar weapons systems. The US has drones, bombers, and missiles which are instruments of “war”, not terror which should mollify the victims to no end. Reply ↓ Lambert Strether Post authorMay 6, 2017 at 3:26 am Oopsie.

Reply ↓ allan May 5, 2017 at 7:39 am Manhattan Condo Deals Targeted for Online Investors by New REIT [Bloomberg] A new real estate investment trust opened shop this week, seeking to raise $50 million from investors online. It plans to use the money on some of the most sought after properties in the world: New York apartments. NY Residential REIT is a “blind pool,” meaning it owns no assets and is courting investors on the strength of its management team to purchase properties once it has funds. It’s springing to life partly from Manhattan’s growing supply of costly apartments, and partly from a Securities and Exchange Commission rule making it easier for small companies to access capital. … The REIT’s relatively quick founding is made possible by the 2012 Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act, or JOBS Act, which loosened rules for budding businesses to advertise and solicit funds from a wider range of investors. In 2015, the SEC offered some added liberation, allowing startups to raise as much as $50 million in a 12-month period. NY Residential REIT joins a growing list of companies, including Fundrise LLC and Realty Mogul Co., that have used those rules to target individual real estate investors. … Target is an appropriate choice of wording.

UK Killer Whale Contained Staggering Levels of Toxic Chemical Lulu had one of the highest concentrations of PCBs ever recorded in a marine mammal PCBs are known to cause damage to marine mammals when they reach concentrations of nine milligrams per kilogram of lipids. The levels in Lulu’s blubber were more than 100 times that, at 950mg/kg. That’s about 1g/kg! One part in 1000 pure poison.

Reply ↓ MoiAussie May 5, 2017 at 10:20 am Innumeracy strikes again. 1 gram = 1000 mg, at least where I come from. 950/1000 = 1, rounded off. You’d still be wrong if you had misread it as micrograms. Reply ↓ Susan the other May 5, 2017 at 1:12 pm and this is my argument against allowing incessant pollutants in our own environment… we are at even more of a disadvantage than the Orcas – because they manufacture blubber and it helps them float to the top to breath among other things (like keeping a constant body temperature, etc.) … we manufacture fat slowly at best because our life evolved on a different gravity – we must carry around our hulk, it does not float us. But still our bodies try to store the toxins in our fat cells – we will soon reach the limit of our ability to store these toxins in our fat cells. Zombie apocalypse. Reply ↓ MyLessThanPrimeBeef May 5, 2017 at 10:00 am More infrastructure projects, at this time, will mean more PCBs, as they are used in capacitors, transformers, and also as lubricants and heat transfer fluids, etc. Their replacements are likely to look good initially, but with the not-so-sapient humans, different problems will probably arise later. I thought the solution was to ban technology in general, or to ban science, but now, I have come to believe we have to ban human population growth. Not sure how to ban it though. Maybe we make human population growth illegal. Again, that doesn’t sound right. Perhaps we control human population growth. But ‘control’ sounds sinister to some. Stabilize human population, that’s how you say it then. Don’t say ‘we have to ban humans,’ as tempting as it sounds. Reply ↓ MoiAussie May 5, 2017 at 10:23 am Recycling is the answer. Recycle the richest, continuing until the population reaches your desired target. Reply ↓ voxhuman May 5, 2017 at 10:41 am Soylent Gold!

We just need to liberate all those unfortunate trapped molecules. Vapourisation should work fine, just stay upwind. Reply ↓ Charger01 May 5, 2017 at 10:25 am Nah, modern electrical equipment doesn’t have PCBs anymore. No, the real interesting change has been the discovery of inadvertently produced PCBS through inks, dyes, pigments, and older types of caulks. Through the manufacture of these chemicals, they can produce small amounts of PCBs. Rutgers has been doing quite a bit of research on this topic for quite a while. I’d argue that the poor whales are victim to biomagnifacation. Reply ↓ Lord Koos May 5, 2017 at 6:32 pm The population problem will solve itself soon enough, I reckon. A super-flu, famines, rising sea levels, fresh water shortages, pollution etc — some combination of these will thin the herd at some point. Reply ↓ Anonymous May 5, 2017 at 9:00 pm Human demographic growth is the elephant in the room Curtailing it would help, if not cure, global climate change, habitat destruction, biodiversity loss, etc. Almost NO ONE will touch the topic Center for Biological Diversity is a pioneer in this regard (though they shilled horribly for HRC) Reply ↓ Procopius May 6, 2017 at 10:49 am Even culling 99% of the population and destroying all technology, it is probably going to take at least hundreds, more likely thousands, and possibly millions of years for the climate to stabilize again, and there’s no reason it is ever going to reach a new equilibrium that is congenial to humans as we are now constructed. Of course science fiction fans know we can write stories about technology learning how to adjust the climate any way we like. I think stories like Asimov’s Caves of Steel are more likely, but a big part of the population is going to die before we get a big enough population into the caves to have a viable self-sustaining economy.

There would be no need for vaccination if we could inherit a parent’s resistance.

Reply ↓ RabidGandhi May 5, 2017 at 8:07 am The article on Spain investigating HSBC says The “Swissleaks” scandal has triggered the opening of proceedings in France, Spain, Belgium and Argentina. True, the previous Argentine administration did cite HSBC for money laundering charges, and had an intense investigation underway. When the Macri Administration came to power they decided to put someone with intimate knowledge of the matter in charge of the investigation. And who is more familiar with the case than HSBC’s lawyer, María Eugenia Talerico, whom Macri promptly placed in the directorate of the Financial Intelligence Unit (UIF). Sounds legit. In other– certainly unrelated– news, the HSBC investigation has ground to a sudden standstill. You can tick Argentina off the list from the article. Oh and BTW Eric Holder has asked me to add this friendly reminder: regulatory capture is not corruption because there is no quid pro quo.

Advertisers are seeking secretly to embed sounds in TV ads which are then picked up by an Android smartphone app or other devices, thus linking together the user’s behaviour datasets for sale (what else?): A team of researchers from the Brunswick Technical University in Germany has discovered an alarming number of Android applications that employ ultrasonic tracking beacons to track users and their nearby environment. Their research paper focused on the technology of ultrasound cross-device tracking (uXDT) that became very popular in the last three years. uXDT is the practice of advertisers hiding ultrasounds in their ads. When the ad plays on a TV or radio, or some ad code runs on a mobile or computer, it emits ultrasounds that are picked up by the microphone of nearby laptops, desktops, tablets or smartphones. SDKs embedded in apps installed on those devices relay the beacon back to the online advertiser, who then knows that the user of TV “x” is also the owner of smartphone “Y” and links their two previous advertising profiles together, creating a broader picture of the user’s interests, device portfolio, home, and even family members. [My emphasis] –234 Android Applications Are Currently Using Ultrasonic Beacons to Track Users This is pretty scary when one thinks about other potential uses of the same technology — broadcasting signals to one’s laptop or smartphone to do god knows what in some app or malware. Reply ↓ MoiAussie May 5, 2017 at 10:36 am The whole ecology of profiling/tracking/advertising on the net is vile, toxic, and yet easy to opt out of.

That means you did nothing wrong and can go ahead and run again and again until you win. I wish everybody had a boss as understanding as the American people. Amid all the excuses, I never see the one decision she could have made that would have won her the election even if she had completely stayed home and mailed it in–no Wisconsin, no Michigan, no hillbillies, and no deplorables (who are always so depressing and needy). She could have even fired her entire incompetent campaign staff after getting the nomination and saved her $1 billion attack Trump campaign budget for a Chelsea birthday bash. ALL SHE NEEDED TO DO WAS MAKE BERNIE HER V.P. That was it. Instead, she looked everywhere else rather than right under her nose and found that squirrel nugget Tim Kaine. Obviously, she thought wrong. Why is this never discussed? Is it because it reveals everything about how terrifying stupid she is and affords no excuses? The guy who got half the votes in your party is standing right in front of you, and who has never really gotten in you face, and raised all his money on quarters and dimes, and can be used like a rented mule to attract his millions of young highly motivated voters who will work tirelessly for you for FREE and who wants to be your buddy to further his popular agenda. Bernie even campaigned her for Christ sakes so please don’t tell me he wouldn’t have jumped on board as VP. It would have been so easy, so simple that nothing that came up during the campaign would have derailed the win. Why is she never asked this question again and again? Reply ↓ John Wright May 5, 2017 at 12:10 pm There would have been fear of irritating large donors by choosing Bernie. With Bernie as a VP and Hillary’s health in question, there was a non zero probability Bernie could be president someday if Clinton-Sanders ticket was elected. The ability to monetize the Clinton Presidency would have dropped. Another opportunity would have been for the Clinton campaign to accept the Bernie supporters’ platform planks. These were non-binding and would have probably pulled in some Bernie supporters without requiring Bernie on the ticket. Instead, Clinton’s team kept the disciplined message of NEVER doing anything to counter the wealthy/well connected interests and aggressively voted all Bernie supporter platform planks down except for one.(on drug legalization) that unintentionally got through when the Clinton enforcer Wendy Sherman was on bathroom break. Kaine was a signaling choice to the wealthy that they would have their interests protected in a Clinton administration, independent of Clinton’s health. Clinton really believed she had it in the bag and did not need to compromise her neoliberal principles in any significant way. Some supporters stated that HRC was the “smartest in the room”. That may have put an upper limit on the collective intelligence in her campaign. Reply ↓ RenoDino May 5, 2017 at 7:29 pm Slap!!! Thank you, I needed that. It was pride and special interests first and foremost. The thought of losing never entered her mind. I would still like to see her asked the question more than once in a public forum. The specter of Bernie, not Trump, needs to haunt her dreams. Reply ↓ Montanamaven May 5, 2017 at 12:52 pm But she was going to trounce Trump, so she didn’t need Bernie. In 2004, Kerry knew he needed the Edwards/Kucinich voters to win, so he grudgingly picked Edwards for VP even though he hated all that populist garbage. It was Hilary’s turn and she didn’t need no stickin’ populist anywhere at court.

McConnell is already dithering and buying time with the CBO request. The Senate will take their time, and then the bill will die in committee because both sides will not be able to compromise. This is all for the house in 2018. The Republicans need to look like they are repealing and replacing the Republican bill. Reply ↓ allan May 5, 2017 at 9:55 am I am really skeptical of `It’s going to die in the Senate”. It’s hard to get a man to let a bill die when a $600 billion tax cut for his campaign donors depends on him not letting it die. Mitch’s chain will be jerked. Reply ↓ Sutter Cane May 5, 2017 at 10:26 am I suspect that it won’t pass the Senate. Republican congressmen will get to tell their base “We tried!” without subjecting them to the horrific effects that the bill would have on constituents had it actually passed. Without actually having to feel these effects, Republican voters can continue to hate Obamacare without having to face the reality that the plan the Republicans they support created was even worse. Republicans then can still get re-elected by talking about how bad Obamacare is. Not sure how long this can go on, but probably at least as long as our current housing, tech, stock, and everything else bubbles. Reply ↓ craazyboy May 5, 2017 at 10:44 am They already got 9 years of lip service outta it as a right wing talking point.

We have had 40 years now of the majority in this country getting ever worse off – and no evidence in my mind that there will come a point where this will be reversed. Sure, there will be plenty that SAY they will do something (Again, Obama and Trump – two of a kind) The thing about straws and camel’s backs is that you just end up with a dead camel… Reply ↓ jrs May 5, 2017 at 10:52 am Yes things getting worse and worse. I don’t think there is any guarantee that things will get better, but some people remind me things can change fast (like acceptance of gays). Oh I know single payer and so on is a harder battle but that explains the optimists who think we’ll have single payer in under 10 years if we only fight hard enough for it. They think things can change fast, and maybe they can, but they also might not. I do think it’s stupid to want the ACHA to pass in the hopes of it bringing it about though. If anyone is silly enough to want that, they are just being stupid IMO. Reply ↓ fresno dan May 5, 2017 at 11:46 am jrs May 5, 2017 at 10:52 am Charles Krauthammer: …….But the irony is in the end, I think Obamacare wins the day because it changed expectations. Look at the terms of the debate. Republicans are not arguing the free market anymore. They have sort of accepted the fact that the electorate sees health care as not just any commodity. It’s not like purchasing a steak or a car. It is something people now have a sense that government ought to guarantee. http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2017/05/05/krauthammer_i_would_predict_that_in_less_than_seven_years_we_will_be_in_a_single-payer_system.html =============================================== Well…, I did say ‘we will see.’ ;) I am kinda of assuming that Krauthammer is a foe of universal health care, but he may have only been a foe of Obama care. Anyway, the fact that Krauthammer from his perspective (which I take is more aware of repub/conservative thought) is more positive about the prospects of universal health care shows that things can change. I was amazed that Obama was able to get elected 2008 – I thought the country just could not elect a black to be president and would not be able to do so for decades (and of course, electing OBAMA as the first black is a whole different issue….). So things can change in a major way much more THAN I can predict…. Still, in the short term I think things in health care get worse before they get better – – but we will see… Reply ↓ JTMcPhee May 6, 2017 at 9:02 am How “black” was Obama? Person of color, maybe.

Reply ↓ visitor May 5, 2017 at 9:15 am In the article New Tools Allow Voice Patterns To Be Cloned To Produce Realistic But Fake Sounds Of Anyone Saying Anything, there is this gem: voice-biometrics software similar to the kind deployed by many banks to block unauthorized access to accounts was fooled 80% of the time in tests using the new technology. Biometrics were touted as vastly superior to old-fashioned security techniques such as passwords. Just as voice-activated authentication/lock-unlock is being broadly deployed (smart phones, smart homes, smart cars, smart browsing) and the likes of Amazon Alexa, Apple Siri, Microsoft Cortana and Google Assistant are becoming ubiquitous, this approach is being completely undermined by parallel voice synthesis technology. And it gives yet another tool for identity theft (beware if you have published enough of your voice on YouTube or Facebook…) I am afraid the result will be a doubling down on biometrics, with even more intrusive approaches further destroying privacy — retinal scans, DNA sampling.

So the LinkedIn article makes it sound as if the hack was diabolically (or russkiliciously) clever. It wasn’t . The cleverness, though, was that the message was able to propagate by going through in-boxes and sending messages from recent contacts.

I’d imagine at least some don’t like the fact the US bombing in the ME has come back to bite France so many times. The French elite were pretty enthusiastic about leveling Libya though, so it’s difficult to blame all of the backlash on Uncle Sugar. Anyway, this part was rather vomit-inducing considering how Barry and the rest of the Democrat party has been out to get Russia for alleged interference in the US election – Obama said he doesn’t plan to get involved often in political situations. “I’m not planning to get involved in many elections now that I don’t have to run for office again, but the French election is very important to the future of France and the values that we care so much about. Because the success of France matters to the entire world,” he said. Yeah, he’s not planning to get involved in many – unless of course some fat cat tosses a $$$ few hundred K $$$ his way.

While it’s funny, it is also generally consistent with his previous statements about universal healthcare (including some statements about supporting a program like the one in Canada – aka Medicare for All). I don’t think it’s inconsistent to support universal healthcare and think that Obamacare is a bad bill. Democrats and the press still can’t understand why someone would think that Obamacare is a bad bill and would want to repeal it. The GOP bill is bad and will make things worse. I wonder what Trump would do if a Medicare-for-All bill (including repealing Obamacare) was somehow passed in both the House and the Senate; my guess is that he would actually sign it. But for this to happen, Democrats would have to be united behind the idea and prioritize helping the American people over campaign donations. This wouldn’t happen anyway as such a bill would be unlikely to get any GOP support.

In the face of Trump’s self-dealing and venality, it’s easy to forget what ‘conservative intellectuals’ truly are. Precisely how disgusting they are. The ever-lovin’ darlings of the National Review editorial staff are as privileged as Hillary, and therefore just as oblivious to the impact of the reveal……. when they publish a piece by an author they sympathize with. He subjected himself and his tenant’s family to the pleasures of “eviction court” because it would have been slightly more expensive to pay off an elderly woman to leave the midcentury crapshack he inherited. He is vividly, obviously butthurt over the ‘need’ to do this. The National Review bought and published his petty screed because he larded it with the haughty ubermensch attitude they like. His contempt for the weak, hapless people he found there that day was what gave him access to their pages. It was stunningly disgusting. Stunning in its stupidity, disgusting in its rudeness, and a powerful argument for redistributive policies. The only language these people understand is the language of money, spoken in the dialect of inheritance taxes.

Recalling some of my limited [and possibly dated] knowledge of telephone systems, the SS7 line can be used to access the signaling layer in some of the large switching links in the backbone of our telephone system. I also recall — and one of the comments to the linked article noted — an SS7 line is included if you order a T1 connection to the phone system. Does anyone know whether the SS7 vulnerabilities might be used to execute a remote exploit on a Class 4 or Class 5 telephone switch? Is the SS7 protocol used in the banking systems backbone?

And to me its like flying. I would gladly pay more for a better seat. Yet a business class seat is charged far, far more than the space 10 tourist seats take, even though the amount of extra space a business class seats takes up isn’t even close to how much more space one gets in business. Competition may make business better – I just happen to think I have never really experience it…. I lost my cheap tracfone a few days back. I went to Walmart and bought another – and because I needed a phone and was away from home I had to have Walmart get me connected. Now Walmart actually was quite exemplary in doing this. Tracfone on the other had managed to take a process that for the life of me I can’t figure out why (well, actually I can figure it out – they just don’t want to hire enough techs to meet demand and my time is of zero value to them….) should take more than 5 minutes into 90 minutes. Somebody had to ask me my security question to transfer my phone number from my lost phone to the new phone. That apparently was the one and only reason for this process to take so long…. Reply ↓ MoiAussie May 6, 2017 at 12:50 am 90 mins sucks, but you should be thankful that they bother with your security question. Over here, anyone who knows your name, address, DoB, and driver’s licence number, can steal your service number (transfer it to a new SIM from a new telco) completely anonymously online. There’s no extra security at all. The first you’ll know about it is when you notice your phone says “emergency calls only”. It’s usually done in the middle of the night and used to intercept authentication codes for online banking by scammers who have already obtained your banking details in some other way. But anyone can do it, eg as an act of revenge against an ex, with little chance of being caught. Reply ↓ Jim Haygood May 5, 2017 at 12:19 pm Fed Vice Chair Stanley Mellon Fischer, on why he can’t be replaced by a robot: Mathematical rules to set interest rates can be useful as guides for central bankers but can’t be followed blindly, said Federal Reserve Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer on Friday. Policy makers must have freedom to depart from the prescriptions of the rules and even change their assessment of which rule is the appropriate benchmark, Fischer said. The House Financial Service Committee passed legislation Thursday to force the Fed to follow a mathematical rule like the one written by Stanford University economist John Taylor. Fischer argued that the Fed’s 12-member committee structure removes the need for a rule by bringing many different perspectives to table. http://www.marketwatch.com/story/feds-fischer-says-central-bank-policy-cannot-be-rules-based-2017-05-05 For our Fed lords, Day One of the common era is Dec 23, 1913. That the fledgling US advanced from a thinly populated colony to the verge of global power with no central bank is, for the Fed, a freak of nature analogous to amino acids combining in the primordial soup to form vertebrates. Obviously fixing the single most important price in the world’s largest economy — the overnight interest rate — can’t be left to the mob judgment of the market. Wise (wo)men of the Fed ensure that no banks will be harmed in the making of this unfolding horror movie.

On their initial demise, my callous observation that it was just a case of pennies returning to heaven, was cold comfort to him. His elderly,naive parents visited the local branch to enquire and, thanks to slick patter, walked out with even more shares to watch crumble in value. My old pal’s brother’s girlfriend,not well to do, inherited RBS shares at around that time and ended up paying more in tax than they were worth.

We like this definition. Hydra Technologies was recognized for its technological achievements by the Mexican Air Force during the inaugural day of the 2017 edition of the “Feria Aeroespacial Mexico” (FAMEX 2017), a major aerospace tradeshow specialized in the military and civilian aviation industries. Hydra receives this award for the creation, manufacture and deployment of the highly advanced S45 Baalam Tactical Unmanned Aerial Surveillance System. Santa Lucia Military Base, Mexico (PRWEB) May 06, 2017 A magnificent inauguration ceremony by Mexico’s President Enrique Peña Nieto in the presence of the Minister of Defense, General Salvador Cienfuegos Zepeda and the Minister of the Navy, Admiral Vidal Francisco Soberon, was witnessed by guests from 32 nations, including more than 17 Air force Commanders and 11 Ministers of Defense. The president’s address focused on the capabilities and exponential growth of the Mexican Aerospace sector. In his speech, Mr. Peña Nieto declared, "The aerospace industry is becoming a turbine that drives our economic growth, and a window that projects a modern and changing Mexico." After the inaugural ceremony the organizing committee presented the AWARD FOR TECHNOLOGICAL ACHIEVEMENT to Hydra Technologies, through its COO, José Luis Ortega. During the ceremony, Mexican Air Force Coronel Jose Antonio Sierra Amador, Chief of Protocol for the FAMEX 2017, delivered a brief but convincing speech, detailing the importance of Hydra Technologies as a leader in the development of aeronautical technologies in Mexico. He specifically mentioned Hydra’s unmanned surveillance systems, that are now one of the main tactical ISR tools of the Mexican Armed Forces. On his part, Mr. Ortega mentioned that the ample collaboration of the Mexican Ministry of Defense has been crucial for the successful evolution of Hydra’s tactical unmanned systems into some of the most sophisticated and reliable in the world. He added that the vast experience transmitted by the Mexican Air Force and Federal Police to Hydra’s R&D team has catapulted the performance of the S45 Baalam (UAS) to unprecedented levels, surpassing the traditional leaders in this market. Mr. Ortega went on to say that Hydra’s offer represents a real solution for many countries, especially due to the lower acquisition, operation and maintenance costs, along with its proven capabilities. “Add to this the dual engine configuration and the capability to operate in extreme weather conditions. All that, and more, is the S45 Báalam TUAS." “I can’t imagine a better showcase for this award than this magnificent trade show, set to be one of the most important in the region and hemisphere,” and concluded, “We have another great advantage over our competition: Hydra’s customer service oriented philosophy, is unique in the market. Many of our systems have been in continuous in-theatre operation, for over 10 years. Match that!” Note 1: Feria Aeroespacial Mexico (FAMEX) is a major aerospace tradeshow specialized in the military and civilian aviation industries and service sectors. It is held every two years near Mexico City. The 2017 edition gathered more than 500 exhibitors from 26 countries, including Boeing, Airbus, Embraer, Saab, Suhkoi, Elbit Systems, IAI, Beechcraft, Bell, Russian Helicopters, Gulfstream, United Technologies and many other Aerospace companies. Note 2: Hydra Technologies is a Mexican Corporation dedicated to the development, manufacture and deployment of military grade Tactical Unmanned Aerial Systems (TUAS).

With more than 100,000 components for the plane, more than 240 local companies have served as suppliers and manufacturers for the C919 aircraft. Once the C919 plane starts mass production and delivery, it is expected to drive the rapid growth of the upstream and downstream industry chains and other high-end manufacturing sectors, such as metal materials, metallurgical processing and dynamic controls. Some cities, including Xi'an, Chengdu, Nanchang, Shenyang and Shanghai, have become involved in the production and assembly of the aircraft. All of them have formed aviation industry clusters and they are about to achieve faster development following the mass production of the C919, according to its manufacturer－the Shanghai-based Commercial Aircraft Corp of China Ltd. Harbin Hafei Industry Co Ltd, an aviation manufacturer in Harbin, Heilongjiang province in northeastern China, is mainly responsible for the manufacturing work of some parts that mainly use composite materials. These parts include the hatch door for the front landing gear, the hatch door for the main landing gear and the vertical tail of the C919. Li Wei, deputy chief engineer of the C919 project at Hafei, said: "Once the C919 aircraft starts large-scale production, it will effectively drive the output value of Hafei." Earlier, Hafei was mainly responsible for manufacturing helicopters. Despite its rich experience in airplane production, the company still faces a lot of technical challenges for the C919 plane. "The C919 aircraft has an advanced design concept, which makes it more difficult for manufacturing techniques. The manufacturing process for the plane has helped us significantly increase our experience and abilities in dealing with composite materials," she said. "Enterprises will be able to take a leading position in the fierce market competition, if they can grab the opportunities in the C919 project and supporting sectors," Li said. By 2030, the demand of single-aisle aircraft is expected to reach 14,500 worldwide and China has a demand of about 2,650, according to an industry forecast. Boeing earlier predicted that China will need 5,110 new single-aisle airplanes through 2035. After its maiden flight, the C919 will also launch a series of test flights, complete its technical verification tests and then enter the period of mass production and delivery in the next few years. So far, COMAC had received 570 orders for the C919 from 23 clients, including domestic airlines such as Air China, China Southern, China Eastern, Hainan Airlines and Sichuan Airlines. Overseas orders account for about 10 percent of the total, including airlines from Germany, Thailand and Africa.

Bali has long been a popular destination for Qatar Airways' passengers, with the airline offering its first direct service in 2014, later enhancing this to a twice daily frequency.

The ticket spurred him to research yellow-light timing and embark on a campaign to make them longer. His work led the state to issue him a $500 fine.

His crusade to make traffic lights remain yellow longer — which began after his wife received a red-light camera ticket — has drawn some interest among transportation specialists and the media. But among the power brokers in his hometown, Beaverton, it has elicited ridicule and exasperation. “They literally laughed at me at City Hall,” ­Jarlstrom recalled of a visit there in 2013, when he tried to share his ideas with city counselors and the police chief. Worse still was getting hit recently with a $500 fine for engaging in the “practice of engineering” without a license while pressing his cause. So last week, Jarlstrom filed a civil rights lawsuit in federal court against the Oregon State Board of Examiners for Engineering and Land Surveying, charging the state’s licensing panel with violating his First ­Amendment rights. “I was working with simple mathematics and applying it to the motion of a vehicle and explaining my research,” Jarlstrom, 56, said. “By doing so, they ­declared I was illegal.” The lawsuit is the latest and perhaps most novel shot in the continuing campaign against the proliferation of state licensing laws that can require costly training and fees before people can work. Jarlstrom is being ­represented by the ­Institute for Justice, a libertarian ­organization partly funded by the billionaire brothers and activists Charles and David Koch. Conservatives are not the only ones worried that willy-nilly licensing requirements for occupations from hair braiding to florists are constricting employment and economic growth. The Obama administration and labor economists across the political spectrum also have criticized what they see as unnecessary and expensive work restrictions. Most of the lawsuits brought by the institute against state licensing boards argue that they are unconstitutionally interfering with individuals’ right to earn a living. They complain that the boards are more interested in keeping out competition than ­protecting consumers against inept practitioners. What is unusual about Jarlstrom’s case is that it does not involve any commercial pursuits, advertising or other moneymaking efforts. Instead, he accuses the board members in his suit of interfering with free speech. “These boards have become the new censors,” said Wesley Hottot, an ­Institute for Justice lawyer who is representing Jarlstrom. “They think that the First Amendment does not apply to them.” Eric Engelson, communications coordinator for the Oregon board, said the board would not comment since the litigation was pending. The board, a semi-independent panel whose members are appointed by the governor, funds itself through licensing and registration fees. Jarlstrom does not have an engineering ­license issued by the state board. He is a self-employed consultant who tests audio products and repairs, upgrades and calibrates test instruments. But he did earn a bachelor’s degree in electronics engineering in Sweden, where he was born. He has also spent a couple of years researching traffic light timing intervals, which included consulting with one of the authors of the original 1959 mathematical formula used as a basis for programming traffic light signals. Nonetheless, the Oregon board, after a nearly two-year investigation, assessed a $500 civil penalty because Jarlstrom called himself “an excellent ­engineer” in one of several emails to the board and informed the Washington County sheriff that he “invented and publicly released a new extended solution” to the problem of yellow lights in traffic flow. The board explained it had “opened a law enforcement case” against Jarlstrom “for the unlicensed practice of engineering,” and cited his attempts to publicize his review, critique and recalculations of the current formulas in use. “This is a broad pattern of this board,” ­Hottot said, adding that he has seen similar ­actions in other states. Last year, for example, the Oregon board opened an investigation into Allen Alley, the Republican candidate for governor, because a political ad stated: “I’m an engineer and a problem solver.” Although Alley has a mechanical engineering degree from Purdue University and worked as an engineer for Ford and Boeing, the board said he was not registered in Oregon as a professional engineer. And in 2014, the board fined a retiree with 40 years experience in engineering $500 for testifying on his daughter’s behalf in a property suit without saying his registration was in ­retirement status. “They have tried to silence people like Mats who have critiqued engineering projects, and that’s dangerous,” Hottot said. “This board does not have a monopoly over the dictionary and cannot redefine the word ‘engineer.’  ” More Local News articles »     RG Daily Digest Get our top headlines delivered to your inbox.         Today’s Local stories Housing Rent control on the table in Legislature amid housing crunch 11:04 a.m. Weather Mostly sunny skies and temperatures near 60 degrees forecast for the Eugene area Saturday Oregon Legislature Oregon Democrats push for elimination of business tax break Recreation Junction City’s 65th annual pet parade draws furry friends and families downtown Springfield Police Longtime Springfield resident gets birthday wish of police ride-along Eugene Police Former Lane County District Attorney Alex Gardner identified as OSP trooper who gave DUII test Local News Swing dancing gains foothold in Eugene Courts Springfield teacher pleads guilty to drunken driving charge, says she hopes to keep job Recreation Art of defense to be on display at Northwest Fencing Academy open house Saturday Crime Former teacher arrested for allegedly burning small child with a hair iron Local News Dexter fire district to host open house Saturday 8:26 p.m. Crime Cottage Grove police arrest man suspected of three armed robberies 9:13 p.m. Crime Man fires gunshot into air during downtown Eugene fight Friday evening 10:44 a.m. Crime Eugene man arrested on charge of having child pornography Local News Oregon’s yellow-light crusader fined for doing math Oregon Pine Mountain Observatory astronomers plan to play hooky during solar eclipse Northwest Judge sanctions lawyer of mayor’s accuser Local News For the Record Religion The Bulletin Local News Calendar Local News Community     Business Business Job growth rebounds A surge in hiring reduces the unemployment rate to a 10-year low and reflects fresh confidence in economy WASHINGTON — A burst of hiring in April provided a reassuring sign for the U.S. economy and reduced a broader gauge of the job market’s health to its lowest level since the recession began nearly … More older Americans still at work Jury awards $110.5 million in baby powder lawsuit Strawberry scientist is sued over the fruits of his research More Business » Lifestyles Travel Every now and then New England brims with modern marvels and historic havens With warmer weather, I often try to ­schedule a return to my hometown of Boston and some of the smaller ­seaside communities of New ­England.
