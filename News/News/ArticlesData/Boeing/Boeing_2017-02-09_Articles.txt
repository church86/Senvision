Fiji Time: 9:47 PM on Saturday 11 February Home Politics Local Sport World Letters Editorial Nai Lalakai Business Features Classifieds Weather Gallery Archives / Front page / Business $28 billion order Reuters Saturday, February 11, 2017 SINGAPORE Airlines announced a provisional order worth $US13.8 billion ($F28b) at list prices to buy 39 Boeing wide-body planes on Thursday as it battles Gulf carriers, dealing a blow to Airbus in the key market for big twinjets. SIA signed a letter of intent with Boeing for 20 777-9s and 19 787-10s to tap additional passenger growth and to modernise its fleet over the next decade. Additional options for the two aircraft types could take the deal to as many as 51 aircraft. The preliminary order is a boost for Boeing as it seeks to restore momentum for the newest version of its long-haul 777, which after a strong debut has not had a firm order in 20 months. It is also expected to shore up export-related US jobs at a time when domestic manufacturing employment is a sensitive political issue under US President Donald Trump. "The carrier is a demanding customer, and its fleet decisions usually define market trends in the intermediate term," said Jefferies analyst Howard Rubel in a note. Airlines typically get discounts on jet orders and Rubel estimated the deal's net value closer to $US6.5b ($F13b) or about a tenth of the US planemaker's annual volume. "While the deal may have been highly competitive, it is business in part of the market that strengthens Boeing's positioning," he said. The agreement, however, leaves a question mark over Airbus proposals to develop a larger 400-seat version of its A350 passenger jet to compete with the 406-seat Boeing 777-9. Singapore's flagship carrier had been seen as a key potential launch customer for the proposed jet, but the European planemaker last year postponed a decision on whether to launch the new project amid pressure on demand for wide-body jets. The fact Airbus was not yet ready to make a definitive offer to supply the new plane, relying instead on the 366-seat A350-1000, may have been a handicap in the contest for Singapore's business, an industry source said. "Our priority is to certify and assure entry to service of the A350-1000," an Airbus spokesman said, adding the two main existing models represented a "good platform" for airline needs.

Falcon Heavy? New Glenn? Fly, then debate. Eric Berger - Feb 10, 2017 9:17 pm UTC Why did a commercial organization endorse the SLS rocket? NASA reader comments 55 Share this story This week, the Commercial Spaceflight Federation, which counts rocket builders SpaceX and Blue Origin among its executive members, made news by declaring its support for NASA’s Space Launch System rocket. The organization’s new chairman, Alan Stern, announced during a conference that “we see many benefits in the development of NASA’s SLS.” This caused a stir in the commercial space community. Later, during an interview with Ars, Stern explained that the commercial space organization has, in the past, engaged in a “bruising battle” over the government’s massive rocket and its influential prime contractor Boeing. The commercial space industry group (of which Boeing is not a member) contended the private sector could deliver the same capability as the SLS for far less than the $2 billion NASA has spent annually this decade to develop the rocket. The SLS will initially be able to heft 70 metric tons to low Earth orbit, but that could grow to 130 metric tons by the late 2020s. Further ReadingHow I learned to stop worrying and love the big $60B NASA rocket But now, Stern said the organization believes the SLS will enable the aims of commercial companies to develop businesses on the Moon, as well as support asteroid mining and other ventures his members are interested in. “We are taking a long view,” Stern said. “This is clearly to the advantage of the expansion of commercial spaceflight. Now, with a new administration and a new Congress, we wanted to put our stake down on the side of SLS.” Don’t forget Sessions At the same time this week, a Politico article noted the efforts of former NASA consultant and SLS critic Charles Miller to push the Trump space program toward an aggressive campaign to begin lunar landings by the end of 2020. Miller is a former member of Trump’s NASA transition team, and he envisions lunar landings becoming possible by leveraging commercial capabilities. The Politico article says Miller is pushing the concept of an “internal competition” within NASA for launch and spacecraft contracts. The competition would be between NASA’s traditional contractors, such as Boeing and Lockheed Martin, and new space firms such as SpaceX and Blue Origin. For launches, a fair competition would almost certainly favor SpaceX and Blue Origin, both of whom are developing heavy lift rockets that are roughly in the same class as the 70-metric ton variant of the SLS. This is because both companies are essentially developing their rockets out of their existing funds—at no direct cost to taxpayers—and their per-launch costs would be a fraction of those forecast for the SLS. Further ReadingWhy Bezos’ rocket is unprecedented—and worth taking seriously The Politico piece likely overplays the influence of Miller, who is but one voice in the battle over NASA’s future. It’s worth remembering that a number of staffers from Jeff Sessions’ Senate office have moved over to positions in the White House, and they will have considerable say in NASA policy. Sessions is from Alabama, where the SLS rocket is being designed and developed at Marshall Space Flight Center. Settled on the pad So what does all this mean for the rocket wars? Instead of an “us vs. them” attitude, many aerospace insiders are taking an “all of the above” approach during the next few years when it comes to rocket capabilities. Given the politics, NASA will probably continue to devote about $2 billion of its $18 billion annual budget to the SLS rocket. At the same time, Congress can continue to pass legislation that does not hinder private efforts to develop heavy-lift rockets. Ultimately, this issue will probably be decided on the launchpad—where it should be. After all, SpaceX’s Falcon Heavy has not yet flown, although it may finally do so this year. NASA’s SLS rocket is nominally slated for a November 2018 launch, although Ars understands this launch date will probably slip into early 2019. And while not much is known about Blue Origin’s New Glenn orbital rocket, company founder Jeff Bezos has said it will fly by the end of this decade. Further ReadingFalcon Heavy? New Glenn? NASA chief says he’s not a “big fan” Theoretically, then, the United States could have three heavy lift rockets at its disposal in 2020. If the reusable Falcon Heavy costs $200 million per flight, and the reusable New Glenn costs $200 million, while an expendable SLS rocket costs $1.5 billion, the agency—and by extension Congress and the White House—will have an easy choice to make. One could argue at that time that NASA should never have spent in excess of $10 billion developing the SLS. But the bottom line is that, six years ago, Congress did not believe in the capacity of SpaceX to build a heavy lift rocket, and Blue Origin’s intentions were not known at that time. So Congress bet on NASA and its traditional contractor Boeing, and the agency kept its large base of employees intact. The Commercial Spaceflight Federation likely recognizes that raising its voice now, publicly at least, against the SLS has limited political upside with a Congress predisposed to favor NASA’s big rocket. Instead of poking NASA or Congress in the eye with a stick, better to stay relevant. Ultimately, when SpaceX, Blue Origin, or both have a launch capability that costs far less than the public alternative, the commercial space organization will have a much more potent argument to make.

"Today´s major order for widebody aircraft enables us to continue operating a modern and fuel-efficient fleet, providing the SIA Group with additional expansion opportunities to ensure that we retain our industry-leading position," SIA´s chief executive officer Goh Choon Phong said in a statement.  Airlines typically get discounts on list prices when placing large orders. SIA´s significant orders and recent moves to extend some of its fuel-hedging contracts to as long as five years show that it is positioning itself for the next phase of growth, said Shukor Yusof, analyst at Malaysian aviation consultancy Endau Analytics. "What´s working for them is that they have very deep pockets and they are putting some of that money to replace fleet and also looking at new destinations," Yusof said.  SIA has been under pressure as demand weakens for long-haul travel amid tough competition from Middle East network carriers. SIA said this would be the airline´s first order for the newest 777 variant that is currently under development, the 777-9.  0 0 Singapore Airlines orders $13.8bln Boeings was posted in Business of TheNews International - https://www.thenews.com.pk on February 10, 2017 and was last updated on February 10, 2017.

Gulliver Business travel Previous Next Latest Gulliver All latest updates The comfort of strangers Passengers like flying on planes not made by Boeing or Airbus Feb 10th 2017, 15:19 by M.R. Add this article to your reading list by clicking this button Tweet ONE statistic that never fails to amaze is the claim by Boeing that one of its 737-model planes lands or takes off somewhere in the world every two seconds. Airbus, the American planemaker’s bitter European rival, makes a similar assertion about its A320 series (although fewer have been built). So ubiquitous are these mid-sized, short-haul aircraft that if you are sat on a modern plane with 120-200 seats you are all but guaranteed to be on an A320 or a 737. That duopoly is nice for Boeing and Airbus, which have collectively delivered 16,800 of the two models. But, in Europe at least, passengers are getting a taste of what else might be. Last July, Swiss International Air Lines became the first carrier in the world to fly the Bombardier CSeries on scheduled commercial operations. It currently deploys five CS100s (pictured) from Zurich to two dozen European cities. The 125-seat jets are borrowed from parent company Lufthansa, Germany’s flag-carrier, which has ordered 30 CSeries and expects to receive another 12 of the planes this year. More recently, Air Baltic, the flag-carrier of Latvia, became the first to fly the CS300, a larger variant which it has configured with 145 seats. Two of the 20 CS300s that the airline has ordered have so far arrived in Riga, to be deployed on routes to 11 European cities. Another six are expected by this summer. Other future CSeries operators include Delta Air Lines and Air Canada, which together account for one-third of the aircraft’s 360 global sales. After struggling with production delays and budget overruns, the CSeries is now enjoying a smooth entry into service. Airlines like the plane for its reliability and fuel efficiency, which Bombardier claims is up to 20% better than competing current-generation aircraft (other manufacturers dispute this). Passengers seem to like the on-board experience, praising its large cabin windows, high humidity and low noise levels (the engines on the CSeries are up to 20 decibels quieter than on comparable planes). The 3-2 seat layout means that only one in every five passengers must endure a middle seat, compared with a third on most 737s and A320s. Plus, Air Baltic and Swiss are compensating those sandwiched between two passengers by adding half an inch (1cm) to the already-ample standard seat width (lifting it from 18.5 inches to 19 inches). Many operators of Boeing and Airbus jets are going in the opposite direction, squeezing their passengers into 17-inch-wide seats. Nor is the CSeries the only new pretender in the skies. Last year, CityJet, a European regional carrier, received the first three of 15 Sukhoi Superjets, which are manufactured by a Russian company better known for building fighter jets. As well as deploying the aircraft in its own colours from London, CityJet will operate three Superjets on behalf of Brussels Airlines this summer. Again, passengers appear impressed with the plane, particularly its roomy cabins. Still, sales are weak compared with the CSeries. Most other Superjet orders have been placed by airlines based in Russia or the former Soviet republics. (The suspicion is that the Russian government has encouraged the sales.) The 98-seat Superjet is also too small to compete directly with the 737 and A320, although Sukhoi has talked about launching a 130-seat version around the end of the decade. Plane enthusiasts will have to wait a similar amount of time before experiencing the other mid-sized, short-haul aircraft currently under development. The Brazilian-made Embraer E2 family of jets—including the E195, which seats up to 144 flyers—will not enter service until at least 2018. The Chinese-made Comac C919, a 150-seater, should follow soon after, though it may be a rare bird in Western skies given that almost all of its buyers are Chinese leasing companies. It is a similar story for the Russian-made Irkut MC-21, another 150-seater, which has even fewer orders that the Superjet. Boeing and Airbus have little reason to panic just yet. But they ought to keep a close eye on Swiss and Air Baltic. If their finance departments enjoy the CSeries as much as their passengers, orders could quickly take off.  Previous Science friction: Hoteliers would like to employ more robots Next : Tweet Submit to reddit View all comments (17)Add your comment Comment (17) Timekeeper reading list Reprints & permissions Print About Gulliver Our correspondents inform and entertain business travellers with news and views to help them make the most of life on the road Follow us on Twitter @EconBizTravel RSS feed Advertisement Doing business in Follow The Economist Facebook Twitter Linked in Google plus Tumblr Instagram YouTube RSS Newsletters Latest updates » Making the Fed great again: A resignation opens up yet another vacancy at...

Nationwide, about 366 flights were canceled as of 2:50 p.m. ET on Friday, according to flight-tracking service FlightAware. That’s a relatively small number on a national basis and marked a dramatic improvement from Thursday’s tally of 3,704 cancellations. FLIGHT TRACKER: Is your flight on time? USA TODAY Deadly snowstorm pounds Northeast, snarling flights and shuttering schools Unsurprisingly, Friday's cancellations were most widespread at airports in the Northeast that were hit hard from Thursday’s weather. Thursday’s flight woes came as a major winter storm walloped parts of the Northeast, dropping heavy snow across an area stretching from eastern Pennsylvania and New Jersey north into New York state and southern New England. The airports serving Boston, New York suffered some of the greatest flight disruptions. Nearly 70% of the entire day's schedule was grounded at both Boston Logan and New York LaGuardia. About half the day’s flights were scrapped at Newark Liberty and New York JFK.

Problems were widespread, though less severe -- relatively speaking -- at other airports. Philadelphia and Washington Reagan National fared better than airports to the north, but still saw cancellations ground about one out of every five of flights Thursday. Other airports – including Portland, Maine; Manchester, N.H.; and Westchester County, N.Y. – all suffered cancellation rates of great than 20%, according to FlightAware. Delays and cancellations resulting from the Northeast storm rippled out even farther, affecting across the U.S. Orlando counted nearly 150 cancellations on Thursday – largely the fallout from the snowy weather in the North. While most of those came on flights to places like New York and Boston, the ripple effect of such disruptions can snare fliers headed to other destinations. An Orlando-to-Houston flight, for example, could become delayed or canceled if the plane or crew scheduled to operate that flight was originally scheduled to come from New York or Boston. For fliers dealing with itineraries disrupted by the storm, flexible rebooking policies remained in effect at most big airlines serving the region -- though the fine print varied significantly from carrier to carrier. Customers affected by the storm were advised to check the airline’s website for information about flight changes and weather waviers.

A Company That's Never Made a Plane Wants to Build the Air Force’s New Jets The Minnesota-based Stavatti has shown off some impressively futuristic designs over the past decade. But so far it's been the aerial equivalent of vaporware—all hype. A Minnesota-based aviation upstart just jumped into a $16-billion contest to build training jets for the US Air Force. The odds are long that Stavatti Aerospace will win, but perhaps not as long as the last time Stavatti tried to disrupt America's military aircraft industry. When Stavatti first made headlines nearly a decade ago, the privately-held company was the industrial equivalent of an internet troll—spreading titillating graphics depicting futuristic airplanes it stood little chance of ever producing. So far, Stavatti's airplanes are all the aerial equivalent of vaporware. All hype. But the warplane market has changed since 2009. Small companies building clever planes stand a better chance today than they did then—and that could boost Stavatti's prospects from impossible to merely highly unlikely. The Air Force wants to buy 350 training planes to replace its 1960s-vintage T-38s. On Dec. 30, 2016, the flying branch formally asked the US aerospace industry for proposals. The goal: To acquire trainers that can better prepare pilots for the latest F-22 and F-35 stealth fighters. "T-X is a program we've got to get right," Air Force chief of staff Gen. Dave Goldfein said in a statement.  All the major aerospace firms worked on prototypes. Several dropped out, leaving America's top two defense contractors—Lockheed Martin and Boeing—to duke it out. Lockheed, based in Maryland, is offering the T-50, a nimble, single-tail jet it co-developed with a South Korean firm. Chicago-based Boeing teamed up with Swedish company Saab to devise a twin-tail plane. Both the Lockheed and Boeing jets are supersonic and have two seats and one engine. Boeing and Lockheed have been working on their trainers under intensive media scrutiny for years. So it came as a surprise to many observers when, on Feb. 1, Stavatti announced it, too, would compete—with not one, but two different planes. CEO Chris Beskar told Motherboard he would submit the Javelin design it bought from a bankrupt aerospace firm in addition its own, homemade Machete design. Both planes are subsonic and come with unusual pedigrees. The 1990s-vintage Javelin once belonged to Colorado-based Aviation Technology Group, which hoped to produce hundreds of the twin-seat, twin-tail planes in conjunction with an Israeli company. It wasn't to be. ATG went bankrupt in 2008, and Stavatti scooped up the rights to the Javelin. "It's a nice airplane," Beskar said. "It's sad when you look at the history of aviation that the project didn't get farther along. We're trying to pick up the pieces." Stavatti is submitting the Javelin in an Air Force design competition. Image: Stavatti. Javelin is older than the Lockheed and Boeing planes are, but Beskar said that shouldn't matter. "We know a lot of people in the Air Force liked Javelin," he said. The prototype Javelin flew briefly in 2005. The Machete, on the other hand, exists only on paper. In 2009, Stavatti pushed the futuristic-looking Machete concept as a gun-armed attack plane to partially replace the Air Force's rugged, heavily-armed A-10 tank-killers, which critics claimed were overkill for fighting insurgents in Iraq and Afghanistan. The Air Force decided to stick with the A-10. The Machete never got off the ground, so to speak. But Beskar said there's no reason the concept couldn't also be a good fit for the T-X competition.  Capt. Michael Hertzog, an Air Force spokesman, said the flying branch is willing to consider all options, including actually flyable prototypes and "developmental" planes that haven't gotten past the blueprint stage. "This program is not stovepiped either way." But realistically, either Boeing or Lockheed is likely to win. Between them, the two companies produce hundreds of airplanes a year for private and military buyers all over the world. The two companies employ thousands of the world's top designers and engineers. Stavatti doesn't currently produce any planes, to say nothing of warplanes. Of course, with computer-aided design, 3D printing and rapid prototyping, today it's theoretically possible for a reasonably competent company to develop a functional combat aircraft in just a few years and at low cost. In fact, Rhode Island-based Textron designed its two-seat Scorpion attack jet in just two years, starting in January 2012.  The Scorpion flew for the first time in December 2013. Simple and flexible, the Scorpion costs just $3,000 per hour to fly—a tenth as much as some heavier, supersonic fighters. Several air forces are reportedly considering purchasing the plane. Even the US Air Force is interested. Anticipating bigger budgets under President Donald Trump, the flying branch has said it could buy potentially hundreds of new attack planes to finally begin replacing those old A-10s.  Beskar said Textron's gamble with the Scorpion has encouraged him to keep pushing his own plane designs. The deadline for Stavatti and the other competition entrants to formally submit their proposals for the T-X contest is March 30. Despite starting work on his planes much later than Boeing and Lockheed did—and with far fewer resources—Beskar said he's optimistic. "We're not behind the curve."

The new legal entity, announced this week, is the fourth separate country-specific business Boeing has established after setting up similar structures in Britain, Australia and Saudi Arabia. Boeing will hire more staff, most of them locals, but also bring in specialists from overseas as it looks to win new deals and grow the $500 million a year worth of products it currently sources from India, Boeing India President Pratyush Kumar told Reuters. He declined to say how many new jobs would be created. "This is to really create the full ecosystem throughout the lifecycle for our customers in India," he said ahead of an Indian airshow in Bengaluru next week. Kumar said the new entity, which Boeing hopes will also grow its manufacturing presence in the country, was designed for its Indian clients rather than those overseas. "In order to support U.S. exports, we need to better support our Indian customers," he said. 'MADE IN INDIA' DILEMMA Boeing, as well as rivals such as Europe's Airbus and Lockheed Martin of the United States, are looking to India, one of the world's largest arms importers, as a future source of growth as Western countries trim defence budgets. India is expected to spend $250 billion over the next decade to modernise its armed forces, but Prime Minister Narendra Modi has also said new deals must involve a share of local production to help the country grow its nascent defence industry. Industry sources say U.S. manufacturers are still uncertain how to square the "Made in India" policy with U.S. President Donald Trump's "America First" rhetoric against locating jobs abroad. Trump has criticised U.S. companies that have moved manufacturing overseas and which then sell their products back to the United States. Boeing's Indian unit is expected to be scaled in such a way that it reflects the amount of business Boeing wins there. Lockheed Martin said this week it wanted to push ahead with plans to move production of its F-16 combat jets to India, but understood Trump's administration might want to take a "fresh look" at the proposal. Boeing has won several deals with India in recent years, including a roughly $2.5 billion contract to supply its Chinook and Apache helicopters, as well as an order for its P-8I maritime spy planes. It also has a joint venture with Tata Advanced Systems in aerospace. Kumar said Boeing was studying a recent request for information issued last month by the Indian Navy for 57 multi-role fighter jets for its aircraft carriers, and analysts expect it to pitch its F/A-18 Super Hornet planes. Industry sources say any deal would most likely depend on Boeing agreeing to build at least part of the jets in India.

The US group said in a statement on 8 February that BDI will be led by Pratyush Kumar, president of Boeing India, and will focus on expanding Boeing's existing engagement with military customers and local industry. Underscoring the importance of the market to Boeing, India becomes only the fourth country outside the United States where the corporation has established a dedicated defence division. Others are in Australia, Saudi Arabia, and the United Kingdom. "As a key market for Boeing, we are making the changes necessary to position ourselves for future growth, drive decision-making closer to the customer, strengthen partnerships with local companies in India, and accelerate our efforts to achieve the country's 'Make in India' vision," said Leanne Caret, president and chief executive officer of Boeing Defense, Space, and Security.

The new legal entity, announced this week, is the fourth separate country-specific business Boeing has established after setting up similar structures in Britain, Australia and Saudi Arabia. Boeing will hire more staff, most of them locals, but also bring in specialists from overseas as it looks to win new deals and grow the $500 million a year worth of products it currently sources from India, Boeing India President Pratyush Kumar told Reuters. He declined to say how many new jobs would be created. "This is to really create the full ecosystem throughout the lifecycle for our customers in India," he said ahead of an Indian airshow in Bengaluru next week. Kumar said that the new entity, which Boeing hopes will also grow its manufacturing presence in the country, was designed for its Indian clients rather than those overseas. "In order to support U.S. exports, we need to better support our Indian customers," he said. Boeing, as well as rivals like Airbus and Lockheed Martin, are looking to India, one of the world's largest arms importers, as a future source of growth as Western countries trim defence budgets. India is expected to spend $250 billion over the next decade to modernise its armed forces, but Prime Minister Narendra Modi has also said that new deals must involve a share of local production to help the country grow its nascent defence industry. Lockheed Martin said this week it wants to push ahead with plans to move production of its F-16 combat jets to India, but understands President Donald Trump's administration may want to take a "fresh look" at the proposal. Trump has criticised U.S. companies that have moved manufacturing overseas and which then sell their products back to the United States. Boeing has won several deals with India in recent years including a roughly $2.5 billion contract to supply its Chinook and Apache helicopters, as well as an order for its P-8I maritime spy planes. It also has a joint venture with Tata Advanced Systems in aerospace. Kumar said Boeing was studying a recent request for information issued last month by the Indian Navy for 57 multi-role fighter jets for its aircraft carriers, and analysts expect it to pitch its F/A-18 Super Hornet planes.

Southeast Asia’s biggest long-distance carrier is considering buying 20 of Boeing’s long-range 777-9 jets, which are set to debut at decade’s end, after studying a rival bid for Airbus Group SE’s A350 aircraft, one of the people said. The carrier is also poised to take at least 19 of the Boeing 787-10, the longest Dreamliner model, the person said. Those aircraft would be valued at $13.8 billion based on list prices, before the discounts that are customary in the industry. The order could be unveiled this week, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the talks are private. Singapore Airlines, under pressure to cut costs after two consecutive quarters of declining profit, has been seeking more fuel-efficient aircraft as crude oil prices show signs of a rebound. Representatives of Singapore Airlines and Boeing declined to comment. “The global trend is to replace inefficient planes with efficient ones,” said K. Ajith, an analyst at UOB Kay Hian Pte in Singapore. “This move is to bring down their cost.” Singapore Airlines also has ordered 67 of Airbus’s A350-900 jets, including an ultra-long range version, as it courts business travelers with non-stop services to markets such as New York and Los Angeles. The new deal would provide a critical boost to two high-profile Boeing products amid a tough market for twin-aisle jets. The Chicago-based company has been working hard to land sales of its upgraded 777X family, after twice announcing it would cut output of current models. –China Daily Do you have more to share about this story - photos or video etc - you can send them to: (newsghana101@gmail.com) TAGS Boeing close Order Singapore SHARE Facebook Twitter tweet Previous articleFirms urged to sign up to Initiative Next articleArgentina stay top of FIFA rankings News Ghana RELATED ARTICLESMORE FROM AUTHOR British Airways Suggests Val’s Getaway Destinations Four Ways Social Media Influences Your Traveling Experience Tanzania saves over US$400 million from foreign travel ban LEAVE A REPLY Cancel reply Please enter your comment!

By: Reuters | New Delhi | Published:February 10, 2017 12:41 pm Boeing will hire mostly local staff as it expands in India. (File Photo) Boeing Company’s new Indian unit will help it win more business from local customers and mean more employment in the South Asian country, the head of the US defence firm’s Indian business said on Friday. The new legal entity, announced this week, is the fourth separate country-specific business Boeing has established after setting up similar structures in Britain, Australia and Saudi Arabia. Watch What Else Is Making News Boeing will hire more staff, most of them locals, but also bring in specialists from overseas as it looks to win new deals and grow the $500 million a year worth of products it currently sources from India, Boeing India President Pratyush Kumar told Reuters. He declined to say how many new jobs would be created. “This is to really create the full ecosystem throughout the life cycle for our customers in India,” he said ahead of an Indian airshow in Bengaluru next week. Kumar said that the new entity, which Boeing hopes will also grow its manufacturing presence in the country, was designed for its Indian clients rather than those overseas. “In order to support US exports, we need to better support our Indian customers,” he said. Boeing, as well as rivals like Airbus and Lockheed Martin, are looking to India, one of the world’s largest arms importers, as a future source of growth as Western countries trim defence budgets. India is expected to spend $250 billion over the next decade to modernise its armed forces, but Prime Minister Narendra Modi has also said that new deals must involve a share of local production to help the country grow its nascent defence industry. Lockheed Martin said this week it wants to push ahead with plans to move production of its F-16 combat jets to India, but understands President Donald Trump’s administration may want to take a “fresh look” at the proposal. Trump has criticised US companies that have moved manufacturing overseas and which then sell their products back to the United States.

ACORN FILE PHOTO A recent announcement that the cleanup of the Santa Susana Field Lab will miss a 2017 completion deadline has activists fuming. Denise Duffield, who is lobbying for complete cleanup of the 2,850-acre site to background standards, said she was angered by a January statement from the Department of Toxic Substances Control indicating cleanup will not begin until this year or next. DTSC is overseeing cleanup efforts of the entire field lab in the hills of Simi Valley, while NASA, the U.S. Department of Energy and Boeing Co. handle remediation for specific portions. “I’ve known that they haven’t started cleanup for some time (but) what’s new is hearing the really quite absurd excuse they’ve given about not realizing the extent of contamination,” Duffield told the Simi Valley Acorn. “They know how contaminated SSFL is . . . and they’ve known for years. STILL STANDING—The Alfa rocket test stand located in Area II of the Santa Susana Field Lab, pictured in 2014. ACORN FILE PHOTO “If the contamination is worse than it thought, DTSC should be demanding the cleanup agreements are upheld and doing whatever it can to speed up the process. But it’s not.” Under agreements signed by all the stakeholders in 2007 and 2010, all detectable soil contamination was supposed to be cleaned up this year, and plans to remediate the groundwater were to be in place. Russ Edmondson, a DTSC spokesperson, told the Acorn in an email that before remediation can begin, the agency must prepare a draft environmental impact report outlining the proposed cleanup activities for the entire site. “Investigation activities for both soil and groundwater are substantially complete and the results are being incorporated into reports that will be used to make cleanup decisions,” he wrote. “There are still contaminated soils and groundwater on the SSFL property that require cleanup activities. Those site-wide cleanup activities will be addressed in the draft EIR and subsequent cleanup decision documents.” The draft EIR was expected to be released in late 2016, but DTSC officials now say the document will be ready this year. Edmonson declined to comment further on the agency’s cleanup plans. Remediation terms The field lab had been used for decades as a nuclear test site and for research in the development of ballistic missiles, rockets and space shuttle equipment. Boeing owns 80 percent of the property, including Area IV, where a partial nuclear meltdown occurred in 1959. The federal government owns the remaining 20 percent. According to the 2007 cleanup agreement with DTSC signed by NASA, DOE and Boeing, the agencies are required to restore Boeing’s portion of the lab to suburban residential standards, meaning people could safely live on the land without getting sick from contamination. In 2010, NASA and DOE signed a separate agreement with the California Environmental Protection Agency to clean up part of Area I and all of Areas II and IV of the field lab to background standards, which calls for the removal of all materials that are unnatural to the site. Dan Hirsch, president of environmental group Committee to Bridge the Gap, one of many advocates in favor of full SSFL cleanup said “people were dancing in the streets” when the cleanup agreements were signed a decade ago. “I am deeply troubled that a cleanup that was supposed to be over hasn’t even started,” Hirsch said. “DTSC and the parties responsible for the pollution have dragged their feet, apparently in the hopes of avoiding their cleanup responsibilities.” Duffield said the delay is “disingenuous” and “outrageous.” “(DTSC) has been falling down on the job at many toxic sites throughout the state for years, and despite new leadership and several legislative initiatives . . . not much has changed. Communities are still being exposed, and DTSC is not protecting them as it should,” she said. Duffield asserts that not cleaning up the field lab only allows harmful nuclear and chemical contamination to continue migrating off-site. Broken promise Asked if the 2017 deadline set a decade ago was premature, Hirsch said “absolutely not.” “The cleanup would be over by now if they had begun when they were supposed to. Instead, it hasn’t even begun,” he said, adding it would realistically take only a few years to complete. “(Cleanup) is technologically simple (in that) contaminated soil is scooped up and taken to a licensed radioactive waste or hazardous waste disposal site.” When it comes to remediation at SSFL, Hirsch questioned whether the agencies “will live up to their repeated promises to enforce the cleanup agreement.” “The site was contaminated 70 years ago. It is astonishing that the parties responsible . . . have gotten away with not cleaning it up for (so long),” he said. “The agreements promising a 2017 cleanup are enforceable only by the parties that signed them and they are the ones breaking them,” he continued. “If the state doesn’t enforce the agreements, there will be no cleanup and people living nearby will risk dying from migrating pollution.” Return to top Copyright © 2004-2017 J.Bee NP Publishing, Ltd., All Rights Reserved.

The other two unidentified customer orders were for two 737-800s and a 777F, respectively. Boeing’s January commercial deliveries totaled 43 aircraft to 20 airlines, four lessors and one unidentified customer, compared to Airbus’ 25 commercial aircraft delivered to 16 airlines and five lessors. Boeing’s January deliveries included seven 737-800s to Ryanair, four aircraft to American Airlines (two 737-800s and two 787-9s) and three aircraft to China’s Xiamen Airlines (two 737-800s and a 787-9). Both Air India and Royal Jordanian Airlines took delivery of a 787-8 aircraft during the month. Additional 787-9 deliveries in January went to Aeromexico, Air Canada (which took two), Etihad Airways, China’s Hainan Airways, US lessor International Lease Finance Co., and an unidentified customer. US lessor Air Lease Corp. and Kuwait Airways each took delivery of a single 777-300ER aircraft during the month, and Alaska Airlines, Delta Air Lines and China’s Okay Airways each took delivery of a 737-900ER. *Note: ATW does not count military, government or private customer orders or deliveries in its commercial aircraft tallies.

Boeing must sell more 777 and 787 jetliners to keep production plans on track, despite a $13.8 billion order that landed earlier on Thursday, its chief executive said. The order from high-profile customer Singapore Airlines is a strong endorsement of both planes, and could lift sales in a sluggish market if other carriers follow Singapore Air's lead, analysts said. But the win over rival Airbus did not lessen two big risks Boeing faces, Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg said on Thursday at a conference in New York hosted by Cowen and Co. Sales of Boeing's highly profitable 777s have slowed so much that Boeing is cutting production 40 percent this year to cope as it begins switching to the successor 777X model that Singapore Airlines ordered. "When I take a look at risk areas, filling out the 777 bridge is the area that we're focused on," Muilenburg said, referring to the production spanning the two models. show chapters Trade, Trump are potential risks for Boeing    Wednesday, 25 Jan 2017 | 9:44 PM ET | 02:45 Boeing also must sell more 787s so it can proceed with plans to lift output to 14 planes a month from 12 in the next few years, Muilenburg said. That increase has looked iffy and some investors have worried Boeing would abandon it. Muilenburg said Boeing still plans to lift 787 output and currently does not envision a scenario that would require cutting 787 output below 12 a month. Boeing shares were up 0.4 percent at $164.42 in afternoon trading. The Singapore Airlines order is a boost for the 787 assembly line, but it does not help with slow 777 sales, since the order is for the newer 777X model. Muilenburg said the airplane market is still "very healthy" with passenger traffic growing 5 percent to 6 percent a year, well ahead of GDP rates. But airlines have deferred delivery of about 2 percent of Boeing's backlog, double the figure Muilenburg cited in July, though well below historical averages. Boeing has already cut 777 output to 7 planes a month from 8.3, and will trim it to 5 a month in August. Deliveries - which generate the bulk of airline payments - will actually fall to about 3.5 a month as Boeing builds 777X test planes in the next few years, he said. show chapters Boeing needs to book more orders: Analyst    Wednesday, 25 Jan 2017 | 5:40 PM ET | 02:02 Even with those reductions, Boeing has to sell a few more 777s to fill out production this year and has 10 percent of production unsold in 2018 and 2019. Those figures include the planned sale of 80 planes to Iran, including 15 Boeing 777s, Muilenburg said. Muilenburg voiced confidence that the Iran sale would go through despite the potential political and bureaucratic hurdles. "These are airplanes that support American manufacturing jobs," he said. "The economic value to the U.S. is real." He also saw prospects for more U.S. defense sales, noting "re-emerging strength" in the defense budget. And, he said Boeing's KC-46 aerial tanker for the U.S. Air Force, which has incurred about $2.4 billion in cost overruns, is expected to begin generating positive cash flow next year.

It will be installed on the station’s Tranquility module.

It will be installed on the station’s Tranquility module. Credits: NanoRacks In a significant move towards further expansion of the International Space Station’s (ISS) burgeoning research and commercial space economy capabilities, NASA has approved the development of the first privately developed airlock and is targeting blastoff to the orbiting lab complex in two years. Plans call for the commercial airlock to be launched on a commercial cargo vessel and installed on the U.S. segment of the ISS in 2019. It enhances the US capability to place equipment and payloads outside and should triple the number of small satellites like CubeSats able to be deployed. The privately funded commercial airlock is being developed by Nanoracks in partnership with Boeing, which is the prime contractor for the space station. The airlock will be installed on an open port on the Tranquility module – that already is home to the seven windowed domed Cupola observation deck and the commercial BEAM expandable module built by Bigelow Aerospace. “We want to utilize the space station to expose the commercial sector to new and novel uses of space, ultimately creating a new economy in low-Earth orbit for scientific research, technology development and human and cargo transportation,” said Sam Scimemi, director, ISS Division at NASA Headquarters in Washington, in a statement. “We hope this new airlock will allow a diverse community to experiment and develop opportunities in space for the commercial sector.” The airlock will launch aboard one of NASA’s commercial cargo suppliers in 2019. But the agency has not specified which contractor. The candidates include the SpaceX cargo Dragon, an enhanced ATK Cygnus or potentially the yet to fly SNC Dream Chaser. Boeing will supply the airlock’s Passive Common Berthing Mechanism (CBM) hardware to connect it to the Tranquility module. Artists concept of first commercially funded airlock on the space station being developed by NanoRacks that will launch on a commercial resupply mission in 2019. It will be installed on the station’s Tranquility module. Credits: NanoRacks The airlock will beef up the capability of transferring equipment, payloads and deployable satellites from inside the ISS to outside, significantly increasing the utilization of ISS, says Boeing. “The International Space Station allows NASA to conduct cutting-edge research and technology demonstrations for the next giant leap in human exploration and supports an emerging space economy in low-Earth orbit. Deployment of CubeSats and other small satellite payloads from the orbiting laboratory by commercial customers and NASA has increased in recent years. To support demand, NASA has accepted a proposal from NanoRacks to develop the first commercially funded airlock on the space station,” says NASA. “The installation of NanoRacks’ commercial airlock will help us keep up with demand,” said Boeing International Space Station program manager Mark Mulqueen. “This is a big step in facilitating commercial business on the ISS.” Right now the US uses the airlock on the Japanese Experiment Module (JEM) to place payloads on the stations exterior as well as for small satellite deployments. But the demand is outstripping the JEM’s availability. The Nanoracks airlock will be larger and more robust to take up the slack. NASA has stipulated that the Center for the Advancement of Science in Space (CASIS), NASA’s manager of the U.S. National Laboratory on the space station, will be responsible for coordinating all payload deployments from the commercial airlock – NASA and non NASA. “We are entering a new chapter in the space station program where the private sector is taking on more responsibilities. We see this as only the beginning and are delighted to team with our friends at Boeing,” said Jeffrey Manber, CEO of NanoRacks. The NanoRacks commercial airlock could potentially launch to the ISS in the trunk of a SpaceX cargo Dragon.

Panneerselvam vs Sasikala: Who will lead Jayalalithaa's party? Track the turmoil in Tamil Nadu here SINGAPORE: Singapore Airlines announced a $13.8 billion provisional order to buy 39 Boeing wide-body aircraft as it pursues expansion opportunities, dealing a setback for Airbus in the battle of big twinjets between the two manufacturers. SIA signed a letter of intent with Boeing for 20 777-9s and 19 787-10s to tap additional passenger growth and to modernize its fleet over the next decade. Additional options for the two aircraft types could take the deal to as many as 51 aircraft. The agreement leaves questions over Airbus proposals to develop a larger 400-seat version of its A350 passenger jet to compete with the 406-seat Boeing 777-9. Singapore’s flagship carrier had been seen as a key potential launch customer for the proposed jet, but Airbus last year postponed a decision on whether to launch the new project amid pressure on demand for wide-body jets. The deal is a boost for Boeing as the US company seeks both to maintain momentum for its newest version of 777. Stay on top of business news with The Economic Times App. Download it Now!

Two Fools examine upcoming backlog numbers, market share, new model plans, and more to see which airplane manufacturer is positioned to come out on top. Motley Fool Staff Feb 9, 2017 at 2:22PM In this clip from Industry Focus: Industrials, Sean O'Reilly and contributor Adam Levine-Weinberg examine two of the biggest aircraft manufacturers to see which one is better positioned to dominate the market in the next five years. Listen in to find out what future orders numbers look like for both companies, how both companies have performed in the last five years, how Boeing (NYSE:BA) has unlocked an entirely new market that Airbus can't tap into, and more. A full transcript follows the video. This podcast was recorded on Jan. 26, 2017. Sean O'Reilly: What's the marketplace look like right now? What's Boeing's backlog? It's some enormous number, in the hundreds of billions or trillions or something. Adam Levine-Weinberg: Yeah, it's been hovering for the last few years in the $450 [billion] to $500 billion range. O'Reilly: Of all the future orders, they may or may not happen, but bottom line, they have this backlog of future orders. You hear, like, Qatar bought like $50 billion worth of planes from Airbus. So what does it look like today with the market in terms of market share and all that stuff? Levine-Weinberg: In terms of overall market share, Airbus is a little bit higher in terms of the orders for the future. But in terms of annual sales -- that's what's being delivered in each year right now -- Boeing still has a little bit of an advantage. That will probably, at least, it might flip at some point. Obviously, if Airbus continues to have more orders than Boeing, then eventually it will be building more planes than Boeing. O'Reilly: So future orders are higher for Airbus. Levine-Weinberg: Exactly. O'Reilly: Was there ever a time where Airbus was way in the lead, or has Boeing been it for ... Levine-Weinberg: This being over the past five years, particularly since the A320neo went on sale, that's really where Airbus has built up this advantage. For a long time, the A320s and 737s were splitting that single-aisle market pretty evenly, but Airbus was at a big disadvantage on the wide bodies. Now, they're even split or thereabouts on the widebodies, and the single-aisle planes Airbus is starting to gain an advantage. So, basically, when we look at the market, Boeing has really done some pretty innovative things in the way that the Dreamliner -- this is the 787 -- has opened up a lot of new markets for airlines. They basically created a plane that is small on the widebody scale; it can seat, typically, 200 to 250 people in a three-class layout where you have lie flat, first class, and that kind of stuff. And it can still fly 8,000 miles around the world, whereas usually only the biggest jets in the past were able to do that. O'Reilly: And those are hard to fill up. That's the trick, right? Levine-Weinberg: Right. What happened was, either you had to put all your flights through one or two very big hubs to generate the traffic, or you had to sell a lot of fares at really low prices that weren't profitable. Great for travelers; not great for the airlines, typically. So basically, Boeing has created this plane that has opened up new markets -- 6,000- to 7,000-mile flights where it was never possible before to profitably fly that on a nonstop basis. O'Reilly: So that was a bit of a brilliant move on their part. Levine-Weinberg: It really was. Boeing and Airbus had different philosophies. Airbus developed the A380, which is this enormous plane, two decks along the entire length of it, can seat 500-600 people. Their idea was, air traffic keeps growing at a really quick rate, it's doubling every 15-20 years, so we just need bigger planes. And that's true, except that Boeing said, "Wait, rather than having everybody continue to go through these hubs and just make them bigger and bigger, why don't we let people go nonstop on routes where you couldn't go nonstop until there was enough of a critical mass of traffic?" And so they had different philosophies. The result is that, right now, Boeing has better coverage of the full market. They have their narrowbodies, which are the shorter-haul flights, usually less than 3,000 miles, and between 120 to 200 seats at the most at the high end of the range. Then they have the small widebody with the 787, and they also have the 777, which is a somewhat larger widebody, which is more in the 250- to 350-seat range. That actually has a new version coming out that's going to make it even bigger and stretch that range up to as many as 400 seats. Airbus, by contrast, they also are very strong, even stronger, in fact, on the narrowbody side, where they have, especially, the largest variant of the A320, which is called the A321, which has really taken off, seen a lot of interest from airlines, because it reduces the cost per seat the more seats you can put on the same version of a plane. The A321 is just better suited to that market than Boeing's largest narrowbody is right now. So Boeing kind of needs to respond to that, and they're very close, potentially, to announcing an even larger version of the 737 that would get it closer in size to the A321. But, after the A321, there's a big gap in Airbus' lineup, where they don't have a lot in the 200- to 250-seat range like Boeing does. O'Reilly: Yeah. It's probably 20/20 in hindsight, but that seems like they dropped the ball there. Levine-Weinberg: Yeah. They've talked about how they've come up with new cabin configurations for the A321, where you can cram more seats on it, but then that starts to give up their advantage in terms of comfort, because some of that comes from actually coming up with a better way of organizing the plane. But for the most part, it's shrinking seats, it's shrinking in the bathroom, it's doing all kinds of stuff, shrinking the galleys, so that they can't serve food out of them anymore. It's really not as easy as Airbus' management has made it seem. So as a practical matter, most airlines aren't going to take them up on the possibility of putting 220 seats onto an A321. It's only going to be the ultra-budget airlines that are going to do that. Adam Levine-Weinberg owns shares of Boeing. Sean O'Reilly has no position in any stocks mentioned.

The order from high-profile customer Singapore Airlines is a strong endorsement of both planes, and could lift sales in a sluggish market if other carriers follow Singapore Air's lead, analysts said. But the win over rival Airbus did not lessen two big risks Boeing faces, Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg said on Thursday at a conference in New York hosted by Cowen and Co. Sales of Boeing's highly profitable 777s have slowed so much that Boeing is cutting production 40 percent this year to cope as it begins switching to the successor 777X model that Singapore Airlines ordered. "When I take a look at risk areas, filling out the 777 bridge is the area that we're focused on," Muilenburg said, referring to the production spanning the two models. Boeing also must sell more 787s so it can proceed with plans to lift output to 14 planes a month from 12 in the next few years, Muilenburg said. That increase has looked iffy and some investors have worried Boeing would abandon it. Muilenburg said Boeing still plans to lift 787 output and currently does not envision a scenario that would require cutting 787 output below 12 a month. Boeing shares were up 0.4 percent at $164.42 in afternoon trading. The Singapore Airlines order is a boost for the 787 assembly line, but it does not help with slow 777 sales, since the order is for the newer 777X model. Muilenburg said the airplane market is still "very healthy" with passenger traffic growing 5 percent to 6 percent a year, well ahead of GDP rates. But airlines have deferred delivery of about 2 percent of Boeing's backlog, double the figure Muilenburg cited in July, though well below historical averages. Boeing has already cut 777 output to 7 planes a month from 8.3, and will trim it to 5 a month in August. Deliveries - which generate the bulk of airline payments - will actually fall to about 3.5 a month as Boeing builds 777X test planes in the next few years, he said. Even with those reductions, Boeing has to sell a few more 777s to fill out production this year and has 10 percent of production unsold in 2018 and 2019. Those figures include the planned sale of 80 planes to Iran, including 15 Boeing 777s, Muilenburg said. Muilenburg voiced confidence that the Iran sale would go through despite the potential political and bureaucratic hurdles. "These are airplanes that support American manufacturing jobs," he said. "The economic value to the U.S. is real." He also saw prospects for more U.S. defense sales, noting "re-emerging strength" in the defense budget. And, he said Boeing's KC-46 aerial tanker for the U.S. Air Force, which has incurred about $2.4 billion in cost overruns, is expected to begin generating positive cash flow next year.

Two Fools examine upcoming backlog numbers, market share, new model plans, and more to see which airplane manufacturer is positioned to come out on top. Motley Fool Staff Feb 9, 2017 at 2:22PM In this clip from Industry Focus: Industrials, Sean O'Reilly and contributor Adam Levine-Weinberg examine two of the biggest aircraft manufacturers to see which one is better positioned to dominate the market in the next five years. Listen in to find out what future orders numbers look like for both companies, how both companies have performed in the last five years, how Boeing (NYSE:BA) has unlocked an entirely new market that Airbus can't tap into, and more. A full transcript follows the video. This podcast was recorded on Jan. 26, 2017. Sean O'Reilly: What's the marketplace look like right now? What's Boeing's backlog? It's some enormous number, in the hundreds of billions or trillions or something. Adam Levine-Weinberg: Yeah, it's been hovering for the last few years in the $450 [billion] to $500 billion range. O'Reilly: Of all the future orders, they may or may not happen, but bottom line, they have this backlog of future orders. You hear, like, Qatar bought like $50 billion worth of planes from Airbus. So what does it look like today with the market in terms of market share and all that stuff? Levine-Weinberg: In terms of overall market share, Airbus is a little bit higher in terms of the orders for the future. But in terms of annual sales -- that's what's being delivered in each year right now -- Boeing still has a little bit of an advantage. That will probably, at least, it might flip at some point. Obviously, if Airbus continues to have more orders than Boeing, then eventually it will be building more planes than Boeing. O'Reilly: So future orders are higher for Airbus. Levine-Weinberg: Exactly. O'Reilly: Was there ever a time where Airbus was way in the lead, or has Boeing been it for ... Levine-Weinberg: This being over the past five years, particularly since the A320neo went on sale, that's really where Airbus has built up this advantage. For a long time, the A320s and 737s were splitting that single-aisle market pretty evenly, but Airbus was at a big disadvantage on the wide bodies. Now, they're even split or thereabouts on the widebodies, and the single-aisle planes Airbus is starting to gain an advantage. So, basically, when we look at the market, Boeing has really done some pretty innovative things in the way that the Dreamliner -- this is the 787 -- has opened up a lot of new markets for airlines. They basically created a plane that is small on the widebody scale; it can seat, typically, 200 to 250 people in a three-class layout where you have lie flat, first class, and that kind of stuff. And it can still fly 8,000 miles around the world, whereas usually only the biggest jets in the past were able to do that. O'Reilly: And those are hard to fill up. That's the trick, right? Levine-Weinberg: Right. What happened was, either you had to put all your flights through one or two very big hubs to generate the traffic, or you had to sell a lot of fares at really low prices that weren't profitable. Great for travelers; not great for the airlines, typically. So basically, Boeing has created this plane that has opened up new markets -- 6,000- to 7,000-mile flights where it was never possible before to profitably fly that on a nonstop basis. O'Reilly: So that was a bit of a brilliant move on their part. Levine-Weinberg: It really was. Boeing and Airbus had different philosophies. Airbus developed the A380, which is this enormous plane, two decks along the entire length of it, can seat 500-600 people. Their idea was, air traffic keeps growing at a really quick rate, it's doubling every 15-20 years, so we just need bigger planes. And that's true, except that Boeing said, "Wait, rather than having everybody continue to go through these hubs and just make them bigger and bigger, why don't we let people go nonstop on routes where you couldn't go nonstop until there was enough of a critical mass of traffic?" And so they had different philosophies. The result is that, right now, Boeing has better coverage of the full market. They have their narrowbodies, which are the shorter-haul flights, usually less than 3,000 miles, and between 120 to 200 seats at the most at the high end of the range. Then they have the small widebody with the 787, and they also have the 777, which is a somewhat larger widebody, which is more in the 250- to 350-seat range. That actually has a new version coming out that's going to make it even bigger and stretch that range up to as many as 400 seats. Airbus, by contrast, they also are very strong, even stronger, in fact, on the narrowbody side, where they have, especially, the largest variant of the A320, which is called the A321, which has really taken off, seen a lot of interest from airlines, because it reduces the cost per seat the more seats you can put on the same version of a plane. The A321 is just better suited to that market than Boeing's largest narrowbody is right now. So Boeing kind of needs to respond to that, and they're very close, potentially, to announcing an even larger version of the 737 that would get it closer in size to the A321. But, after the A321, there's a big gap in Airbus' lineup, where they don't have a lot in the 200- to 250-seat range like Boeing does. O'Reilly: Yeah. It's probably 20/20 in hindsight, but that seems like they dropped the ball there. Levine-Weinberg: Yeah. They've talked about how they've come up with new cabin configurations for the A321, where you can cram more seats on it, but then that starts to give up their advantage in terms of comfort, because some of that comes from actually coming up with a better way of organizing the plane. But for the most part, it's shrinking seats, it's shrinking in the bathroom, it's doing all kinds of stuff, shrinking the galleys, so that they can't serve food out of them anymore. It's really not as easy as Airbus' management has made it seem. So as a practical matter, most airlines aren't going to take them up on the possibility of putting 220 seats onto an A321. It's only going to be the ultra-budget airlines that are going to do that. Adam Levine-Weinberg owns shares of Boeing. Sean O'Reilly has no position in any stocks mentioned.

The aviation giant has announced it's setting up a new unit that will handle all its defense operations in the country. It will focus on building up a manufacturing and engineering base in addition to other services, the company said. India will be only the fourth country outside the U.S. where Boeing (BA) has a dedicated defense arm. The others are in the U.K., Australia and Saudi Arabia. India is on a weapons spending spree, shelling out more than $50 billion on military equipment last year. That's already more than Russia -- and India is projected to overtake the U.K. as the world's third largest defense buyer by 2018, according to IHS Jane's. Related: Aviation execs carrying wish list to Trump meeting Boeing has been aggressively expanding into the Indian market. The U.S. manufacturer announced an $11 billion deal last month to supply 100 new 737 Max 8 commercial aircraft to budget airline Spicejet. With India also shopping for new fighter jets, Boeing is showing that it's ready to compete with the likes of Lockheed Martin (LMT) and Swedish firm Saab -- both of which have offered to manufacture their combat aircraft in India. Lockheed has even said it's willing to make the South Asian country a global manufacturing hub for its F-16 jets. Boeing already supplies several military aircraft to India, including C-17 supply planes and its Apache and Chinook helicopters. It has also pitched its own fighter -- the F/A 18 Super Hornet -- to the Indian navy, a company representative told CNNMoney, and would potentially make them in the country if it wins the contract. Related: India could shell out $12 billion for new fighter jets The company appears eager to align itself with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's 'Make in India' program, aimed at boosting local manufacturing. "We are making the changes necessary to position ourselves for future growth ... and accelerate our efforts to achieve the country's 'Make in India' vision," Leanne Caret, the company's head of defense, space and security, said in a statement.

Slow 777 sales are one of the top risks facing Boeing in the next few years, Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg said on Thursday at a New York conference hosted by Cowen and Co. Boeing also must sell more 787s so it can proceed with plans to lift output to 14 planes a month from 12 in the next few years, he said.

The airline agreed to buy 20 777-9s, which are set to debut at the decade’s end, and 19 787-10s, the longest Dreamliner model, for $13.8 billion at list prices that don’t reflect customary discounts, Singapore Air said in a statement on Thursday. Boeing was nearing an order for at least 35 wide-body aircraft from Singapore Air, Bloomberg News reported Wednesday. Deliveries of the jets will start as early as in the financial year ending March 2021, the carrier said, adding it also has options to buy six more of each of the two models. The new deal would provide a critical boost to two high-profile Boeing products amid a tough market for twin-aisle jets. The Chicago-based company has been working hard to land sales of its upgraded 777X family after twice announcing it would cut output of current models. The new aircraft will replace some of Singapore Air’s ageing Boeing planes such as the 777-300ER, while giving the carrier’s low-cost units rights to jets not yet on the market. “Singapore is a deeply respected long-haul carrier, both in terms of brand quality and technical proficiency,” said Richard Aboulafia, an aerospace analyst with Fairfax, Virginia-based Teal Group. “It would be a fantastic endorsement.” Shares of the airline rose 1.4 per cent to S$9.94 on Thursday in Singapore trading before the announcement.   Business travellers Singapore Air has ordered 67 of the A350-900 jets, including an ultra-long range version, as it courts business travellers with non-stop service to markets such as New York and Los Angeles. The Asian carrier’s current fleet includes 10 A350s, which Airbus says consume 25 per cent less fuel than Boeing’s 777 aircraft, with 57 more on order. The airline already has 30 787-10s on order, according to Boeing’s website. Singapore Air has also reviewed a proposed, longer version of the twin-engined 777 that would carry as many as 450 passengers, a load previously handled only by four-engine jumbo jets, Bloomberg News reported Wednesday. Buffeted by marquee Middle Eastern peers such as Emirates and regional budget operators, the only Asian carrier to have flown the Concorde has said it will maintain vigilance over its costs. Singapore Air, following two consecutive quarters of decline in profits, said Tuesday that 2017 will be another challenging year amid “tepid global economic conditions and geopolitical concerns.” The carrier is the launch customer for the 787-10, the first Boeing jetliner to be manufactured solely at its new North Charleston, South Carolina, campus. Deliveries are slated to begin next year. Singapore Air’s unit Scoot currently flies the carbon-composite 787-800 and 787-900 variants of the Dreamliners.   Boeing announces setting up of Boeing Defence India NEW DELHI: Global defence and aviation major Boeing on Wednesday announced setting up of Boeing Defence India (BDI), a local business entity, to support the company’s future growth in the country, said a company statement. “The BDI will serve as a framework enabling us to draw on the growth and productivity benefits that India can offer Boeing,” said Leanne Caret, President and Chief Executive Officer of Boeing Defense, Space and Security. Pratyush Kumar, President, Boeing India, will lead the new entity, said the statement. “Boeing has made accelerated investments to grow the manufacturing, skill development and engineering scale in the country,” Kumar was quoted in the release as having said. “With BDI, Boeing will expand its engagement with India’s Ministry of Defence to deliver advanced capability and readiness to India’s military customers and to develop a competitive supplier base in the country that is integrated into Boeing’s global supply chain,” Kumar added. — IANS More from Aviation Airlines fighting tech glitches every day 49 minutes ago EU readies to face Gulf carrier challenge Boeing wins $14b jet order from Singapore Air GCC defence spending ‘to rise’ in 2017 Air Arabia swings to Dh38.6m loss in Q4 Etihad Airways passenger numbers up 6% to 18.5m Watch: Emirates plane 'chases' Lamborghini Passengers up 20.5% at Doha airport to 37m tags from this storyIndia follow this tag on MGN filed underGulfNewsBusinessAviation tagsIndia follow this tag on MGN+ MGNemirates airline Also In AviationAirlines fighting tech glitches every day Business Gallery Classic car collectors gather in Paris Look: Inside the most expensive home in US Business Videos PlayAbu Dhabi Ship Building enjoys growing success Strata UAE leads aerospace manufacturing FOLLOW US Most Popular ViewedCommentedGalleriesVideos 01EU readies to face Gulf carrier challenge 02Watch: Emirates plane 'chases' Lamborghini 03Air Arabia swings to Dh38.6m loss in Q4 04Boeing wins $14b jet order from Singapore Air 05Gulf flight becomes world's longest journey 11Images Look: Inside the most expensive home in US Feb 08, 2017 14Images In Pictures: Hatta Honey Festival Feb 02, 2017 20Images Highlights: SIHH luxury watch show Jan 18, 2017 10Images In pictures: Dubai International Boat Show 2012 Mar 13, 2012 Play Abu Dhabi Ship Building enjoys growing success Nov 24, 2016 Play Strata UAE leads aerospace manufacturing Oct 25, 2016 Play Video: Electronics fiesta as Gitex opens Oct 01, 2016 Play Emirates opens SkyPharma in Dubai Sep 18, 2016 Explore the UAE Find the right airport Currency Converter first-currency currencyAEDDinarRupee= first-currency currencyINRDinarRupee Most Popular on Gulf News New UAE entry visa system approved Man who bought No 1 car plate goes on trial 2017 UAE holidays Meet Dubai's first female royal pilot Man tried to set himself on fire at Kaaba Newly-wed woman on bike killed in RAK Jet ski scam costs tourists Dh20,000 What excess sugar in diet does to your body UAE to adopt new entry visa system Close Recommended For You Hindus adapt to new lifestyles in PakistanPUBLISHED ON Feb 10, 2017 Last baby boomPUBLISHED ON Feb 10, 2017 Trump to Iran president: ‘Better be careful’PUBLISHED ON Feb 11, 2017 Feedback Get The Paper Our Apps Mobile friendly version Our location Advanced Search Sitemap MY GULF NEWS GulfNews.com is the most widely read newspaper, and online site in English in the Middle East.

 Europe's best low-cost airline could be an issue for the Trump administration Benjamin Zhang Feb. 9, 2017, 11:42 AM 24,372 facebook linkedin twitter email print A Norwegian Air Boeing 787. Norwegian Air On Thursday, President Donald Trump met with leaders from the airline industry, and it's possible that one of the topics discussed was the controversial arrival of Norwegian Air International. In December, the US Department of Transportation finalized its decision to grant NAI approval to operate flights into the US. "This case is among the most novel and complex ever undertaken by the department," the DOT said in its final ruling on the matter. "Regardless of our appreciation of the public policy arguments raised by opponents, we have been advised that the law and our bilateral obligations leave us no avenue to reject this application." Many in the US airline industry, especially the unions that represent pilots and flight attendants, would like to see the Trump administration overturn the decision. But it's unclear what action, if any, the Trump administration would take against Norwegian. White House press secretary Sean Spicer indicated on Tuesday that the deal with Norwegian involves the hiring of large numbers of US-based pilots and cabin crew. Spicer also said that as a major customer for Boeing airplanes, Norwegian has significant economic interests in the US. "We are a big Boeing customer, so I think we do exactly what Trump would like everybody to do," Norwegian Air CEO Bjoern Kjos told Reuters on Wednesday. "Trump wants American jobs. We provide American jobs." Norwegian currently operates about 120 Boeing 737 and 787 airliners, with another 120 or so Boeing jets on order. NAI is one of several subsidiaries operating under the Norwegian banner. Unlike the rest of Norwegian, NAI is based in Dublin, instead of in Norway. Critics say this allows NAI to take advantage of Ireland's employment laws, which are significantly less stringent than Norway's. As a result, they say, NAI could hire pilots and cabin crew members from Asia at lower wages to fly transatlantic routes. The airline operates flights into the US using its Norway-registered Norwegian Long Haul subsidiary with Europe-based pilots and crew. Norwegian Air In a December statement, Edward Wytkind, president of the AFL-CIO's Transportation Trades Department, wrote: "Today's decision betrays America's aviation workers by granting a rogue, flag-of-convenience airline a permit to serve the United States. Unless reversed, this decision threatens a generation of US airline jobs and tells foreign airlines that scour the globe for cheap labor and lax employment laws that America is open for business. Clearly, a Norwegian-owned airline that is based in Ireland for the purpose of evading Norway's labor and tax laws, and that will hire crews under Asian contracts, is in violation of these explicit labor protections and should be denied entry into our marketplace." The Air Line Pilots Association, a union that represents 54,000 US and Canadian pilots, echoed the AFL-CIO's aggravation. "We are extremely disappointed by the Department of Transportation's decision to run roughshod over the US Open Skies agreement and allow Norwegian Air International to fly to and from the United States," ALPA President Tim Canoll said in a statement. "This decision is an affront to fair competition and will ultimately result in the loss of US jobs and, potentially, significant losses for the US international aviation industry."

"In October this year, Norwegian announced it would open its first US pilot base at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport," Kjos said in a statement. "Now that we finally have our DOT approval for Norwegian Air International, I'm pleased to announce that we will also be opening a second and third pilot base in the US." The second and third crew bases will be in the New York and Greater Boston areas, Norwegian Air representative Anders Lindstrom told Business Insider. The initial group of 25 US pilots destined for the base in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, will begin training in March to fly the airline's fleet of Boeing 787 Dreamliners. Once the airline's new 737 MAX 8 airliners enter service in the middle of 2017, Norwegian is expected to hire another batch of US pilots for the New York and Greater Boston bases. According to Lindstrom, all pilots hired for the new US bases are either flying for another US airline or are American pilots flying overseas. Lindstrom also told Business Insider in April that the airline pays all its pilots "almost exactly" the same, regardless of where they are based. The airline said its New York base would have more than 300 cabin crew members by year's end, while its Fort Lauderdale base would have nearly 200. Norwegian expects to hire another 150 pilots and cabin crew members in the US in 2017. In 2018, Norwegian is eyeing the possibility of additional pilot and crew bases in Oakland, California, and LAX, Lindstrom said. Norwegian Air CEO Bjorn Kjos in the cockpit of a Boeing Dreamliner. Norwegian When the Boeing 737 MAXs arrive later this year, Norwegian will begin offering $69 tickets to Europe from secondary cities in the northeastern US. Norwegian Air CCO Thomas Ramdahl told The Wall Street Journal in December that the airline intends to set up a base at Stewart International Airport in upstate New York, and Bradley International Airport in Hartford, Connecticut, is also under consideration. In 2017, the airline is expected to receive nine 787s, six 737 MAXs, and 17 737 NGs. Norwegian — which in July was named the best low-cost airline in Europe by Skytrax for the fourth consecutive year — operates 450 routes with 150 destinations around the world. Skytrax reviewers also named Norwegian the best long-haul low-cost airline in the world.

Posted 09 Feb 2017 16:26 Updated 09 Feb 2017 23:53 FILE PHOTO - Boeing's logo is seen during Japan Aerospace 2016 air show in Tokyo, Japan, October 12, 2016. REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon/File Photo Enlarge Caption  Email More A A SINGAPORE/PARIS: Singapore Airlines (SIA) announced a provisional order worth US$13.8 billion at list prices to buy 39 Boeing wide-body planes on Thursday (Feb 9) as it battles Gulf carriers, dealing a blow to Airbus in the key market for big twinjets. SIA signed a letter of intent with Boeing for 20 777-9s and 19 787-10s to tap additional passenger growth and to modernise its fleet over the next decade. Additional options for the two aircraft types could take the deal to as many as 51 aircraft. The preliminary order is a boost for Boeing as it seeks to restore momentum for the newest version of its long-haul 777, which after a strong debut has not had a firm order in 20 months. It is also expected to shore up export-related US jobs at a time when domestic manufacturing employment is a sensitive political issue under US President Donald Trump. "The carrier is a demanding customer and its fleet decisions usually define market trends in the intermediate term," said Jefferies analyst Howard Rubel in a note. Airlines typically get discounts on jet orders and Rubel estimated the deal's net value to be closer to US$6.5 billion or about a tenth of the US planemaker's annual volume. "While the deal may have been highly competitive, it is business in part of the market that strengthens Boeing's positioning," he said. The agreement, however, leaves a question mark over Airbus proposals to develop a larger 400-seat version of its A350 passenger jet to compete with the 406-seat Boeing 777-9. Singapore's flagship carrier had been seen as a key potential launch customer for the proposed jet, but the European planemaker last year postponed a decision on whether to launch the new project amid pressure on demand for wide-body jets. The fact that Airbus was not yet ready to make a definitive offer to supply the new plane, relying instead on the 366-seat A350-1000, may have been a handicap in the contest for Singapore's business, an industry source said. "Our priority is to certify and assure entry to service of the A350-1000," an Airbus spokesman said, adding the two main existing models represented a "good platform" for airline needs. LAUNCH CUSTOMER SIA's significant orders and recent moves to extend some of its fuel-hedging contracts to as long as five years show it is positioning itself for the next phase of growth, said Shukor Yusof, an analyst at Malaysian aviation consultancy Endau Analytics. "What's working for them is that they have very deep pockets and they are putting some of that money to replace fleet and also looking at new destinations," Yusof said. SIA has been under pressure as demand weakens for long-haul travel amid tough competition from Middle East network carriers. SIA said this would be the airline's first order for the newest 777 variant that is currently under development. SIA is already the launch customer for the 787-10, which is also currently in development, having placed an initial order in 2013 for 30 aircraft for delivery from the 2018/19 financial year. The airline operates a varied fleet with more than 50 current-generation 777s in service, while subsidiaries SilkAir, Scoot and SIA Cargo also operate other Boeing planes. Thursday's preliminary order was SIA's biggest Boeing deal by value. It also operates other Airbus aircraft including the smaller A350-900 model and the four-engined A380, the world's largest airliner, some of which could be replaced by 777-9s. The growth of the big twinjet is driven by advances in the largest engines, sparking a parallel battle between Boeing ally General Electric and Airbus supplier Rolls-Royce. GE is the sole supplier of engines on the 777 and Rolls-Royce won the US$1.7 billion order from SIA to power the 19 Boeing Dreamliner aircraft.

By Julie Johnsson, Andrea Rothman and Benjamin Katz Bloomberg Boeing won orders for 39 wide-body aircraft from Singapore Airlines Ltd. as Southeast Asia’s biggest long-distance carrier upgrades its fleet over the next decade with more fuel-efficient models in an effort to cut costs. The airline agreed to buy 20 777-9s, which are set to debut at the decade’s end, and 19 787-10s, the longest Dreamliner model, for $13.8 billion at list prices that don’t reflect customary discounts, Singapore Air said in a statement on Thursday. Boeing was nearing an order for at least 35 wide-body aircraft from Singapore Air, Bloomberg News reported Wednesday. Deliveries of the jets will start as early as in the financial year ending March 2021, the carrier said, adding it also has options to buy six more of each of the two models. The new deal would provide a critical boost to two high-profile Boeing products amid a tough market for twin-aisle jets. The Chicago-based company has been working hard to land sales of its upgraded 777X family after twice announcing it would cut output of current models. The new aircraft will replace some of Singapore Air’s aging Boeing planes such as the 777-300ER, while giving the carrier’s low-cost units rights to jets not yet on the market. “Singapore is a deeply respected long-haul carrier, both in terms of brand quality and technical proficiency,” said Richard Aboulafia, an aerospace analyst with Fairfax, Virginia-based Teal Group. “It would be a fantastic endorsement.” Shares of the airline rose 1.4 percent to S$9.94 on Thursday in Singapore trading before the announcement. Singapore Air has ordered 67 of the A350-900 jets, including an ultra-long range version, as it courts business travelers with non-stop service to markets such as New York and Los Angeles. The Asian carrier’s current fleet includes 10 A350s, which Airbus says consume 25 percent less fuel than Boeing’s 777 aircraft, with 57 more on order. The airline already has 30 787-10s on order, according to Boeing’s website. Singapore Air has also reviewed a proposed, longer version of the twin-engine 777 that would carry as many as 450 passengers, a load previously handled only by four-engine jumbo jets, Bloomberg News reported Wednesday. Buffeted by marquee Middle Eastern peers such as Emirates and regional budget operators, the only Asian carrier to have flown the Concorde has said it will maintain vigilance over its costs. Singapore Air, following two consecutive quarters of decline in profits, said Tuesday that 2017 will be another challenging year amid “tepid global economic conditions and geopolitical concerns.” The carrier is the launch customer for the 787-10, the first Boeing jetliner to be manufactured solely at its new North Charleston, South Carolina, campus. Deliveries are slated to begin next year. Singapore Air’s unit Scoot currently flies the carbon-composite 787-800 and 787-900 variants of the Dreamliners.

The deal – for 20 Boeing 777-9s and 19 787-10 “Dreamliners" – would be valued at $13.8 billion at list prices, though big carriers typically negotiate substantial discounts on such orders. The order is Singapore Airlines’ first for Boeing’s newest and largest 777 variant, the 777-9 that is expected to begin flying later this decade. The order for the 19 787-10 Dreamliners – also Boeing’s latest and biggest variant of that aircraft – are on top of 30 that Singapore has already made for the jet. Singapore Airlines is regarded as one of the world’s most luxurious carriers, frequently winning accolades for its high-end service. The carrier has specialized in long-distance flying, flying many long-haul and ultra-long haul routes from its hub in Southeast Asia. The airline said the new widebody, long-haul jets would be used both for expansion and to help it replace older aircraft retiring from its fleet.

The Singapore order is a score for Boeing, which is battling against Airbus’ new A350 and revamped A330 in the market for widebody jets. Bloomberg News adds more perspective, writing “the new deal would provide a critical boost to two high-profile Boeing products amid a tough market for twin-aisle jets.

Singapore has otherwise been a strong customer for Airbus' A350. It has ordered 67 of Airbus A350-900 jets, including a new "ultra long-haul" (ULR) version expected to begin flying next year. Singapore, which would be the launch customer for that variant of the A350, has said it intends to use the ULR version to resume nonstop flights between Singapore and New York, a route that would become the world's longest.

The deal – for 20 Boeing 777-9s and 19 787-10 “Dreamliners" – would be valued at $13.8 billion at list prices, though big carriers typically negotiate substantial discounts on such orders. The order is Singapore Airlines’ first for Boeing’s newest and largest 777 variant, the 777-9 that is expected to begin flying later this decade. The order for the 19 787-10 Dreamliners – also Boeing’s latest and biggest variant of that aircraft – are on top of 30 that Singapore has already made for the jet. Singapore Airlines is regarded as one of the world’s most luxurious carriers, frequently winning accolades for its high-end service. The carrier has specialized in long-distance flying, flying many long-haul and ultra-long haul routes from its hub in Southeast Asia. The airline said the new widebody, long-haul jets would be used both for expansion and to help it replace older aircraft retiring from its fleet.

Singapore Airlines - already regarded as one of the world's most luxurious airlines - is set to overhaul its aircraft cabins in a move that it says will set the new industry standard for top-end air travel. The carrier took delivery of its first plane configured with the new interior Sept. 19, 2013, showing off the Boeing 777-300ER to media at a delivery ceremony at Boeing's widebody assembly line facility in Everett, Wash.

The Singapore order is a score for Boeing, which is battling against Airbus’ new A350 and revamped A330 in the market for widebody jets. Bloomberg News adds more perspective, writing “the new deal would provide a critical boost to two high-profile Boeing products amid a tough market for twin-aisle jets. The Chicago-based company has been working hard to land sales of its upgraded 777X family after twice announcing it would cut output of current models. The new aircraft will replace some of Singapore Air’s aging Boeing planes such as the 777-300ER, while giving the carrier’s low-cost units rights to jets not yet on the market.” USA TODAY Singapore Airlines plans return to U.S. with new 'ultra long-range' A350 Further, Reuters writes the Singapore deal “leaves a question mark over Airbus proposals to develop a larger 400-seat version of its A350 passenger jet to compete with the 406-seat Boeing 777-9.” Singapore Airlines had been viewed as a potential launch customer for such an Airbus product, “but the European planemaker last year postponed a decision on whether to launch the new project amid pressure on demand for wide-body jets,” Reuters adds. “The fact Airbus was not yet ready to make a definitive offer to supply the new plane, relying instead on the 366-seat A350-1000, may have been a handicap in the contest for Singapore's business, an industry source said” in reference to Singapore’s Thursday agreement with Boeing. Singapore has otherwise been a strong customer for Airbus' A350. It has ordered 67 of Airbus A350-900 jets, including a new "ultra long-haul" (ULR) version expected to begin flying next year. Singapore, which would be the launch customer for that variant of the A350, has said it intends to use the ULR version to resume nonstop flights between Singapore and New York, a route that would become the world's longest.

Copyright Getty Images Advertisement Boeing Co. (IW 500/9) won orders for 39 wide-body aircraft from Singapore Airlines Ltd. as Southeast Asia’s biggest long-distance carrier upgrades its fleet over the next decade with more fuel-efficient models in an effort to cut costs.  The airline agreed to buy 20 777-9s, which are set to debut at the decade’s end, and 19 787-10s, the longest Dreamliner model, for $13.8 billion at list prices that don’t reflect customary discounts, Singapore Air said in a statement on Thursday. Boeing was nearing an order for at least 35 wide-body aircraft from Singapore Air, Bloomberg News reported Wednesday. Deliveries of the jets will start as early as in the financial year ending March 2021, the carrier said, adding it also has options to buy six more of each of the two models. The new deal would provide a critical boost to two high-profile Boeing products amid a tough market for twin-aisle jets. The Chicago-based company has been working hard to land sales of its upgraded 777X family after twice announcing it would cut output of current models. The new aircraft will replace some of Singapore Air’s aging Boeing planes such as the 777-300ER, while giving the carrier’s low-cost units rights to jets not yet on the market. Popular Now OEE – Learn How to Use It Right Achieving Competitive Advantage Through Supply Chain Management 5 Key Trends Impacting the Aerospace Sector and What They Mean for Growth “Singapore is a deeply respected long-haul carrier, both in terms of brand quality and technical proficiency,” said Richard Aboulafia, an aerospace analyst with Fairfax, Virginia-based Teal Group. “It would be a fantastic endorsement.” Shares of the airline rose 1.4% to S$9.94 on Thursday in Singapore trading before the announcement. Courting Business Travelers Singapore Air has ordered 67 of the A350-900 jets, including an ultra-long range version, as it courts business travelers with non-stop service to markets such as New York and Los Angeles. The Asian carrier’s current fleet includes 10 A350s, which Airbus says consume 25% less fuel than Boeing’s 777 aircraft, with 57 more on order. The airline already has 30 787-10s on order, according to Boeing’s website. Singapore Air has also reviewed a proposed, longer version of the twin-engine 777 that would carry as many as 450 passengers, a load previously handled only by four-engine jumbo jets, Bloomberg News reported Wednesday. Buffeted by marquee Middle Eastern peers such as Emirates and regional budget operators, the only Asian carrier to have flown the Concorde has said it will maintain vigilance over its costs. Singapore Air, following two consecutive quarters of decline in profits, said Tuesday that 2017 will be another challenging year amid “tepid global economic conditions and geopolitical concerns.” The carrier is the launch customer for the 787-10, the first Boeing jetliner to be manufactured solely at its new North Charleston, S.C., campus. Deliveries are slated to begin next year. Singapore Air’s unit Scoot currently flies the carbon-composite 787-800 and 787-900 variants of the Dreamliners.

Home Industry Singapore Airlines places $13.8 billion wide-body Boeing order Singapore Airlines places $13.8 billion wide-body Boeing order Singapore Airlines (SIA) announced a $13.8 billion provisional order to buy 39 Boeing wide-body aircraft as it pursues expansion opportunities, dealing a setback for Airbus Group in the battle of big twinjets between the two manufacturers. By: Reuters | Singapore/ Paris | Updated: February 9, 2017 5:47 PM Singapore’s flagship carrier had been seen as a key potential launch customer for the proposed jet, but Airbus last year postponed a decision on whether to launch the new project amid pressure on demand for wide-body jets. (Reuters) Singapore Airlines (SIA) announced a $13.8 billion provisional order to buy 39 Boeing wide-body aircraft as it pursues expansion opportunities, dealing a setback for Airbus Group in the battle of big twinjets between the two manufacturers. SIA signed a letter of intent with Boeing for 20 777-9s and 19 787-10s to tap additional passenger growth and to modernise its fleet over the next decade. Additional options for the two aircraft types could take the deal to as many as 51 aircraft. The agreement leaves questions over Airbus proposals to develop a larger 400-seat version of its A350 passenger jet to compete with the 406-seat Boeing 777-9. Singapore’s flagship carrier had been seen as a key potential launch customer for the proposed jet, but Airbus last year postponed a decision on whether to launch the new project amid pressure on demand for wide-body jets. The fact that Airbus was not ready to make a definitive offer to supply the new plane, relying instead on the 366-seat A350-1000, may have been a handicap in the contest for Singapore’s business, an industry source said. You may also like to watch this “Our priority is to certify and assure entry to service of the A350-1000,” an Airbus spokesman said, adding that the two main existing models represented a “good platform” for airline needs. The deal is a boost for Boeing as the U.S. company seeks both to maintain momentum for its newest version of 777 and to shore up export-related jobs at a time when domestic manufacturing employment is a sensitive political issue under US President Donald Trump. “Today’s major order for widebody aircraft enables us to continue operating a modern and fuel-efficient fleet, providing the SIA Group with additional expansion opportunities to ensure that we retain our industry-leading position,” SIA’s chief executive officer Goh Choon Phong said in a statement. Airlines typically get discounts on list prices when placing large orders. LAUNCH CUSTOMER SIA’s significant orders and recent moves to extend some of its fuel-hedging contracts to as long as five years show that it is positioning itself for the next phase of growth, said Shukor Yusof, analyst at Malaysian aviation consultancy Endau Analytics. “What’s working for them is that they have very deep pockets and they are putting some of that money to replace fleet and also looking at new destinations,” Yusof said. SIA has been under pressure as demand weakens for long-haul travel amid tough competition from Middle East network carriers. SIA said this would be the airline’s first order for the newest 777 variant that is currently under development, the 777-9. SIA is already the launch customer for the 787-10, which is also currently in development, having placed an initial order in 2013 for 30 aircraft for delivery from the 2018/19 financial year. The airline is a longstanding Boeing customer with more than 50 current-generation 777 aircraft in service while subsidiaries SilkAir, Scoot and SIA Cargo also operate other Boeing planes. The growth of the big twinjet is driven by advances in the largest engines, sparking a parallel battle between Boeing ally General Electric and Airbus supplier Rolls-Royce. Rolls-Royce won the $1.7 billion order from SIA to power the 19 Boeing Dreamliner aircraft. Please Wait while comments are loading...

Photo: Reuters mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 6:15 PM, February 9, 2017 Updated: 8:27 PM, February 9, 2017 CHICAGO — Boeing won orders for 39 wide-body aircraft from Singapore Airlines (SIA) as South-east Asia’s biggest long-distance carrier upgrades its fleet over the next decade with more fuel-efficient models in an effort to cut costs. The airline agreed to buy 20 777-9s, which are set to debut at the decade’s end, and 19 787-10s,the longest Dreamliner model, for US$13.8 billion (S$19.5 billion) at list prices that don’t reflect customary discounts, SIA said in a statement on Thursday (Feb 9). Boeing was nearing an order for at least 35 wide-body aircraft from SIA, Bloomberg News reported on Wednesday. Deliveries of the jets will start as early as in the financial year ending March 2021, the carrier said, adding it also has options to buy six more of each of the two models. The new deal would provide a critical boost to two high-profile Boeing products amid a tough market for twin-aisle jets.The Chicago-based company has been working hard to land sales of its upgraded 777X family after twice announcing it would cut output of current models. The new aircraft will replace some of SIA’s aging Boeing planes such as the 777-300ER, while giving the carrier’s low-cost units rights to jets not yet on the market. “Singapore is a deeply respected long-haul carrier, both in terms of brand quality and technical proficiency,” said Mr Richard Aboulafia, an aerospace analyst with Fairfax, Virginia-based Teal Group. “It would be a fantastic endorsement.” Shares of the airline rose 1.4 per cent to S$9.94 on Thursday in Singapore trading before the announcement. BUSINESS TRAVELLERS Singapore Air has ordered 67 of the A350-900 jets, including an ultra-long range version, as it courts business travellers with non-stop service to markets such as New York and Los Angeles. The Asian carrier’s current fleet includes 10 A350s, which Airbus says consume 25 per cent less fuel than Boeing’s 777 aircraft, with 57 more on order. The airline already has 30 787-10s on order, according to Boeing’s website. SIA has also reviewed a proposed, longer version of the twin-engine 777 that would carry as many as 450 passengers, a load previously handled only by four-engine jumbo jets, Bloomberg News reported on Wednesday. Buffeted by marquee Middle Eastern peers such as Emirates and regional budget operators, the only Asian carrier to have flown the Concorde has said it will maintain vigilance over its costs. SIA, following two consecutive quarters of decline in profits, said on Tuesday that 2017 will be another challenging year amid “tepid global economic conditions and geopolitical concerns”. The carrier is the launch customer for the 787-10, the first Boeing jetliner to be manufactured solely at its new North Charleston, South Carolina, campus. Deliveries are slated to begin next year. SIA’s unit Scoot currently flies the carbon-composite 787-800 and 787-900 variants of the Dreamliners.  Separately, Rolls-Royce won a US$1.7bn order from SIA for Trent1000 engines to power 19 Boeing 787 Dreamliner Aircrafts.

The national carrier and 787-10 launch customer also announced its recommitment for its previous order for 30 787-10 airplanes. When finalized, the order will be posted on the Boeing Orders and Deliveries website. “Singapore Airlines has been a valued Boeing customer for more than 50 years and we are honored they have selected the 777X and additional 787-10s to expand its future widebody fleet. They are the most efficient, capable and passenger preferred airplanes in their class,” said Boeing Commercial Airplanes President & CEO Kevin McAllister. “We appreciate the trust, commitment and endorsement of Singapore Airlines, and look forward to delivering market-leading capability to one of the world’s most widely respected industry leaders.” Advanced technology including a new composite wing, all-new engines and superior aerodynamics will result in the incredible fuel efficiency promised by the 777X family. The 777-9 will be the largest and most efficient twin-engine commercial jet in the world with the lowest operating cost per seat of any commercial airplane and no competitor in its market segment. The 787-10 is the third member of the super-efficient, passenger-pleasing 787 Dreamliner family. With its greater passenger and cargo capacity, high degree of commonality and passenger-pleasing features, the 787-10 will complement the family while setting a new benchmark for fuel efficiency and operating economics – 25 percent better fuel per seat and emissions than the airplanes than the competition it will replace.  Since its introduction, the 787 Dreamliner has opened more than 130 new city pairs, connecting the world as never before.

SIA signed a letter of intent with Boeing for 20 777-9s and 19 787-10s to tap additional passenger growth and to modernise its fleet over the next decade. Additional options for the two aircraft types could take the deal to as many as 51 aircraft. The preliminary order is a boost for Boeing as it seeks to restore momentum for the newest version of its long-haul 777, which after a strong debut has not had a firm order in 20 months. It is also expected to shore up export-related U.S. jobs at a time when domestic manufacturing employment is a sensitive political issue under U.S. President Donald Trump. "The carrier is a demanding customer, and its fleet decisions usually define market trends in the intermediate term," said Jefferies analyst Howard Rubel in a note. Airlines typically get discounts on jet orders and Rubel estimated the deal's net value closer to $6.5 billion or about a tenth of the U.S. planemaker's annual volume. "While the deal may have been highly competitive, it is business in part of the market that strengthens Boeing's positioning," he said. The agreement, however, leaves a question mark over Airbus proposals to develop a larger 400-seat version of its A350 passenger jet to compete with the 406-seat Boeing 777-9. Singapore's flagship carrier had been seen as a key potential launch customer for the proposed jet, but the European planemaker last year postponed a decision on whether to launch the new project amid pressure on demand for wide-body jets. The fact Airbus was not yet ready to make a definitive offer to supply the new plane, relying instead on the 366-seat A350-1000, may have been a handicap in the contest for Singapore's business, an industry source said. "Our priority is to certify and assure entry to service of the A350-1000," an Airbus spokesman said, adding the two main existing models represented a "good platform" for airline needs. LAUNCH CUSTOMER SIA's significant orders and recent moves to extend some of its fuel-hedging contracts to as long as five years show it is positioning itself for the next phase of growth, said Shukor Yusof, analyst at Malaysian aviation consultancy Endau Analytics. "What's working for them is that they have very deep pockets and they are putting some of that money to replace fleet and also looking at new destinations," Yusof said. SIA has been under pressure as demand weakens for long-haul travel amid tough competition from Middle East network carriers. SIA said this would be the airline's first order for the newest 777 variant that is currently under development. SIA is already the launch customer for the 787-10, which is also currently in development, having placed an initial order in 2013 for 30 aircraft for delivery from the 2018/19 financial year. The airline operates a varied fleet with more than 50 current-generation 777s in service, while subsidiaries SilkAir, Scoot and SIA Cargo also operate other Boeing planes. Thursday's preliminary order was SIA's biggest Boeing deal by value. It also operates other Airbus aircraft including the smaller A350-900 model and the four-engined A380, the world's largest airliner, some of which could be replaced by 777-9s. The growth of the big twinjet is driven by advances in the largest engines, sparking a parallel battle between Boeing ally General Electric and Airbus supplier Rolls-Royce. GE is the sole supplier of engines on the 777 and Rolls-Royce won the $1.7 billion order from SIA to power the 19 Boeing Dreamliner aircraft.

The aviation giant has announced it's setting up a new unit that will handle all its defense operations in the country. It will focus on building up a manufacturing and engineering base in addition to other services, the company said. India will be only the fourth country outside the U.S. where Boeing has a dedicated defense arm. The others are in the U.K., Australia and Saudi Arabia. India is on a weapons spending spree, shelling out more than $50 billion on military equipment last year. That's already more than Russia -- and India is projected to overtake the U.K. as the world's third largest defense buyer by 2018, according to IHS Jane's. Boeing has been aggressively expanding into the Indian market. The U.S. manufacturer announced an $11 billion deal last month to supply 100 new 737 Max 8 commercial aircraft to budget airline Spicejet. With India also shopping for new fighter jets, Boeing is showing that it's ready to compete with the likes of Lockheed Martin and Swedish firm Saab -- both of which have offered to manufacture their combat aircraft in India. Lockheed has even said it's willing to make the South Asian country a global manufacturing hub for its F-16 jets. Boeing already supplies several military aircraft to India, including C-17 supply planes and its Apache and Chinook helicopters. It has also pitched its own fighter -- the F/A 18 Super Hornet -- to the Indian navy, a company representative told CNNMoney, and would potentially make them in the country if it wins the contract. The company appears eager to align itself with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's 'Make in India' program, aimed at boosting local manufacturing. "We are making the changes necessary to position ourselves for future growth ... and accelerate our efforts to achieve the country's 'Make in India' vision," Leanne Caret, the company's head of defense, space and security, said in a statement.

The aviation giant has announced it’s setting up a new unit that will handle all its defense operations in the country. It will focus on building up a manufacturing and engineering base in addition to other services, the company said. India will be only the fourth country outside the U.S. where Boeing has a dedicated defense arm. The others are in the U.K., Australia and Saudi Arabia. India is on a weapons spending spree, shelling out more than $50 billion on military equipment last year. That’s already more than Russia — and India is projected to overtake the U.K. as the world’s third largest defense buyer by 2018, according to IHS Jane’s. Boeing has been aggressively expanding into the Indian market. The U.S. manufacturer announced an $11 billion deal last month to supply 100 new 737 Max 8 commercial aircraft to budget airline Spicejet.

The airline carried 18.5 million guests during the year, up six per cent on 2015.  The airline was also part of the evolution of Etihad Aviation Group, a wider aviation and tourism business which now also includes Etihad Airways Engineering; Airline Equity Partners; Etihad Airport Services and Hala Group. The formation of Etihad Aviation Group was announced in May 2016.    During the year, Etihad Airways operated more than 109,000 scheduled passenger and cargo flights spanning around 446 million kilometres and 112 destinations. Capacity, measured in available seat kilometres (ASK), grew by nine per cent and passenger traffic, measured by revenue passenger kilometres (RPK), rose by eight per cent. The average load factor held steady at 79 per cent.   Etihad Airways’ fleet of 119 aircraft is one of the youngest and most environmentally-friendly in the industry, with an average age of 6 years. During the year, the airline took delivery of 10 aircraft: three Airbus A380s, five Boeing 787s and two Boeing 777-200 cargo freighters. An additional 12 aircraft are set for delivery in 2017, including nine Boeing 787s, two Airbus A380s and one A330-200 freighter. Etihad holds the strongest credit rating in the aviation industry (A by Fitch), demonstrating the strength of its successful business model which is widely acknowledged by the international financial community. Advertisement James Hogan, President and Chief Executive Officer of Etihad Aviation Group (EAG), said: “2016 saw sustained growth in a very tough business environment. This is where Etihad Airways’ superior products and services show their true value and where the strength of the EAG business model comes into effect through its diversity of businesses, cost effective synergies and global spread of risk. Most importantly, in 2016 we were able to introduce our new Group structure, which positions this business for long-term growth and development.”  Etihad Airways launched Venice in Italy, Rabat in Morocco and Sabiha Gokcen in Turkey as new destinations in 2016. The much-admired Airbus A380 began serving Mumbai and Melbourne, and the Boeing 787 Dreamliner was deployed on new routes, including Perth, Shanghai, Johannesburg and Dusseldorf.  The airline added a fifth daily flight on the Doha route, an extra daily flight to Cairo and Kozhikode, and increased frequencies to Dammam, Manila and Tehran.   Etihad Airways carried more than 76 per cent of the total passengers who travelled to and from Abu Dhabi International Airport in 2016. With the addition of the airline’s equity partners that operate flights into the UAE capital, the combined total rises to 86 per cent of passenger traffic at the airport.  The airline’s codeshare and equity partnerships delivered 5.5 million passengers onto Etihad Airways’ flights, an increase of nine per cent over the five million passengers in 2015.  The airline launched new codeshare agreements with Avianca Colombia, Avianca Brasil, Kulula, Precision Air and Montenegro Airlines. Etihad Airways’ existing codeshares with airberlin, Alitalia, Brussels Airlines, Flynas, Jet Airways, Malaysia Airlines, Hong Kong Airlines, and Virgin Australia were significantly expanded. Etihad Airways also launched new interline agreements with Lufthansa, Pegasus, Malindo and LATAM. As a result, the airline now offers a combined passenger and cargo network of nearly 600 destinations through its 188 interline and 53 codeshare partnerships. Etihad Airways’ equity partner network, including airberlin, Air Serbia, Air Seychelles, Alitalia, Jet Airways, Virgin Australia and Etihad Regional, represents the seventh largest global grouping of airlines. In 2016, the combined fleet of 705 aircraft carried 126.6 million guests.  In November, Etihad Airways Engineering dealt with a record breaking week of heavy maintenance at its state-of-the-art facility in Abu Dhabi. Aircraft from six of the seven partner airlines were worked on by the company’s 3,000-strong team.  During 2016, Etihad Cargo carried 592,700 tonnes, which was flat year-on-year. Etihad Cargo expanded its freighter services to several new markets, including Columbus Rickenbacker, Ohio in the US; East Midlands and London Stansted in the UK; Copenhagen; Brussels; Addis Ababa and Casablanca in Africa; Colombo; Muscat; and Zhengzhou in China. This brings the number of freighter-only destinations to 15.  Strong growth was achieved within the group’s loyalty businesses with over three million new members joining the Etihad Guest, MilleMiglia (Alitalia), topbonus (airberlin) and JetPrivilege programmes, which now provide benefits to nearly 20 million members.   The Etihad Aviation Group workforce, as of 31 December, stood at 26,635 employees, representing 150 nationalities. The airline continued to prioritise its Emiratisation programme, and in November, celebrated the graduation of 310 future leaders from the Future Leaders Programmes, a strong indication of the company’s commitment to investing in its people.   There are currently more than 3,000 Emirati employees – 52 per cent of whom are women, including engineers and pilots.   Mr Hogan added: “2017 will be another challenging year. We will continue to expand prudently and efficiently, reflecting the nature of the economic environment. We remain optimistic and have every belief that our robust business model will succeed and, most importantly, stand the test of time.”   2016 was a year of impressive accolades for Etihad Airways - the pinnacle being the Skytrax Certified 5-Star Airline Rating - the most sought after quality status in the airline industry. Etihad was also named the ‘World’s Leading Airline’ at the World Travel Awards for the eighth consecutive year and collected the coveted Crystal Cabin Award for the Boeing 787 First Class cabin design. During the year, Etihad Guest marked its 10th anniversary and reached 4.7 million members. About Etihad Aviation Group Etihad Aviation Group (EAG) is a diversified global aviation and travel group comprising four business divisions – Etihad Airways, the national airline of the United Arab Emirates, Etihad Airways Engineering, Hala Group and Airline Equity Partners. The group has minority investments in seven airlines: airberlin, Air Serbia, Air Seychelles, Alitalia, Jet Airways, Virgin Australia, and Swiss-based Darwin Airline, trading as Etihad Regional.   From its Abu Dhabi base, Etihad Airways flies to, or has announced plans to serve, more than 110 passenger and cargo destinations in the Middle East, Africa, Europe, Asia, Australia and the Americas. The airline has a fleet of over 120 Airbus and Boeing aircraft, with 204 aircraft on firm order, including 71 Boeing 787s, 25 Boeing 777Xs, 62 Airbus A350s and 10 Airbus A380s.

Then he talked about it more on national television. "If we don't get the prices down, we're not going to order them. We're going to stay with what we have," President-elect Trump said during a call-in interview  on the "Today" show . On Wednesday, Boeing's CEO  told reporters  the company is committed to building a new plane for less than $4 billion. SEE MORE: Historic Boeing-Iran Deal May Get Trumped It is possible a new set of Air Force One planes, which are  large enough  to carry the commander in chief, his staff and members of the media, were never going to cost that much to begin with.  In March 2016, the U.S. Government Accountability Office estimated  two new Boeing  747-8 planes would cost about $3.2 billion. Although NBC pointed out the total cost  may be more  by the time Boeing delivers the new four-engine aircrafts. The goal was to have the new Air Force One planes ready to fly by the 2024 fiscal year. There's no word on whether Boeing's effort to keep costs down will change that timeline.

A decision to go with Boeing would be a setback for Airbus Group, which plans to build a bigger version of its A350 although these plans have already been placed on hold amid uncertainty over demand for wide-body jets. Singapore Airlines is looking at choosing 20 of the latest model of Boeing's 777, the 406-seat 777-9 over a stretched version of the Airbus A350, Bloomberg said, citing people familiar with the matter. It is also poised to take at least 19 of the longest Dreamliner model, the Boeing 787-10, it reported, adding that the order could be unveiled this week.(http://bloom.bg/2lscCA1) Singapore Airlines said in a statement that it has discussions with aircraft manufacturers on a regular basis about its fleet requirements. "Such discussions are confidential until we have a firm deal to announce", it said. Boeing declined to comment. Singapore Airlines has also reviewed a proposed version of the twin-engine 777 that would carry about 450 passengers, a load previously handled by four-engine jumbo jets only, Bloomberg said.

Singapore Airlines has for months been weighing the latest model of Boeing’s 777, the 406-seat 777-9, against a possible stretched version of the A350 that Airbus is considering building to increase the capacity of its newest jetliner to 400 seats. The carrier is also poised to take at least 19 of the longest Dreamliner model, Boeing 787-10, Bloomberg said. Singapore also has reviewed a proposed version of the twin-engine 777 that would carry about 450 passengers, a load previously handled by four-engine jumbo jets only, Bloomberg reported. Airbus has so far delayed taking a decision on whether to build the larger version, variously code-named A350-8000 and most recently A350-2000. Industry sources said the two main potential customers whose decisions could have a decisive influence on whether the project goes ahead are Singapore Airlines and British Airways. CNN reported in November that Singapore Airlines would make a decision by end-year. Boeing Co declined to comment, while Singapore Air was not immediately available for comment. — Reuters                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Bursa Malaysia to trade higher next week Amazon warns that trade protectionism could hurt business China regulator still plans oil futures, weighs easing equity curbs Dollar rises on hopes for Trump tax reform Ringgit likely to trade easier vis-à-vis greenback next week If Trump hits China, regional demand would ease blow in Asia Bursa Malaysia opens easier Sri Lanka eyes China free trade deal this year, PM to visit in May Another day, another mall: How KL Gateway Mall hopes to succeed in a crowded market Ringgit opens slightly lower against US dollar Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: ‘The White Helmets’ filmmakers discuss ‘Muslim ban’ Reuters Video: Obama, Richard Branson go kiteboarding Reuters Video: ‘Babies’ on board for Beyonce and Jay Z Reuters Video: ‘Babies’ on board for Beyonce and Jay Z Reuters Video: ‘The White Helmets’ filmmakers discuss ‘Muslim ban’ Reuters Video: Obama, Richard Branson go kiteboarding Related Articles Boeing’s US$14b Singapore Air order does not fill 777, 787 gap, says CEO Can Singapore companies be globally competitive? — Larry Sim and See Wei Hwa Singapore advisory panel eyes new drivers of economic growth Singapore Airlines to buy 39 Boeing planes worth US$13.8b Australia’s Suncorp to consider sale of A$2b life insurance unit Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2017 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | RecomN - Local Services

(AAPL) Stock Bulls Boeing Co (BA) Stock Gives Savvy Investors a Good Payout View All Posts Don’t let a faulty altimeter lead you to believe Boeing Co (NYSE:BA) is in need of repair. Any stray measurements in Boeing stock’s share price on Wednesday were tied to a pending dividend payment — and one that has already paid nice dividends to some options traders. Let me explain. Source: Phillip Capper via Flickr Shares of Boeing have been flying high in 2017 after hitting record highs following the aircraft manufacturer’s earnings beat late last month. But in Wednesday’s session, BA stock may have appeared to have had a slight crack in its fuselage; pardon the pun. Houston, Boeing Has a Problem? At a share price of $164.08 and depending on your trading vendor, BA stock was off either $1 or 0.61% or a more eyebrow raising -$2.42 or -1.45%. The $1.42 difference between the two readings in Boeing shares is tied to the stock going ex-dividend Wednesday, with a cash payment of $1.42 scheduled for March 3. Bearing this in mind, trade vendors who recognize the ex-date will show BA stock as trading lower by the less-significant 0.61%. Any chart or quote platforms that erroneously fail to account for the ex-date will indicate Boeing has declined by a larger 1.45%. For BA stock investors who were long or purchased shares by Tuesday’s close, Wednesday’s minor damage is reflected by the more modest 0.61% dip, as $1.42 will be paid back to shareholders next month to dampen the otherwise larger 1.45% decline in Boeing. What’s the point? Dividends aren’t a free lunch, as the money distributed is taken out of the share price of the stock. If Wednesday wasn’t an ex-date in Boeing, BA stock would be trading $1.42 higher at $165.50 vs. $164.08 — bottom-line. For the proverbial free lunch, you’d have to look at Tuesday’s heavy volume options trading in BA stock tied to ‘dividend play’ activity, which looks to arbitrage the future payout with an immediate overnight payoff. BA Stock Dividend Play Strategy To illustrate how this might be accomplished, we can look at the BA stock Feb $155 call, as roughly $14,200 in profits was distributed to one or more options traders today due to the ex-dividend.

The Dow Jones industrial average rose about 100 points, with Caterpillar contributing the most gains. "Investors were worried that the tax plan was pushed to the backburner. Now, investors are celebrating that it's not," said Kim Forrest, senior equity analyst at Fort Pitt Capital. The S&P 500 gained 0.36 percent, with energy, materials and industrials leading advancers. Lifting the energy sector were oil prices, as U.S. crude futures for March delivery popped 1.6 percent to settle at $53.86 per barrel after the International Energy Agency reported that OPEC members' cuts in January equated to 90 percent of the agreed volumes. The market "continues to feed on itself. I think that part of the impetus is the S&P has confirmed a new all-time high, along with the Dow and Nasdaq," said Daniel Deming, managing director at KKM Financial. He added that Trump's initiatives "keep being received as positive." The Nasdaq composite gained about 0.33 percent. The three major indexes also posted weekly gains. Major indexes this week Source: FactSet "When he said the words 'phenomenal tax plan,' that gave hope to the market that we were going to get a tax plan sooner," said Quincy Krosby, market strategist at Prudential Financial. "He basically spurred the market, saying he hasn't forgotten about tax reform. That issue was at the core of the market's embrace of Trump's agenda, along with deregulation." Trump said Thursday in a meeting with airline executives that "lowering the overall tax burden on American business is big league ... that's coming along very well," adding that an announcement would come over the next two or three weeks. Stocks climbed to record highs following those remarks. "But who was in the market yesterday? Trading volume was low, and it was algorithms that were triggered immediately, lifting the market," said Krosby, noting that trading desks were not as active in the northeast Thursday because of a snowstorm that hit the region. Nevertheless, other asset classes also reacted to Trump's remarks. Treasury yields and the dollar gained ground. On Friday, the benchmark U.S. 10 yield rose to trade at 2.409 percent, while the short-term two-year yield hovered around 1.2 percent. Getty Images A trader works on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. The U.S. dollar held around 0.1 percent against a basket of currencies, with the euro near $1.064 and the yen around 113.34. Gold futures for April delivery, meanwhile, fell 90 cents to settle at $1,235.90 per ounce. "It should be kept in mind that the ongoing Trump developments have heavily eroded investor risk appetite while political risks continue to weigh on global sentiment. Although the yellow metal remains slightly pressured on the daily charts, bulls could reclaim control if the $1220 regions defend," Lukman Otunuga, research analyst at FXTM, said in a note. Equities, along with the dollar and Treasury yields, have skyrocketed since Trump's election on the prospects of more business friendly and reflationary policies. "The rally yesterday in stocks after Trump said he will unveil a 'phenomenal' tax plan made sense because we wanted to see him focus on what was most important and not get distracted by other noise and tweets. There remains though the issue of what will be unveiled," said Peter Boockvar, chief market analyst at The Lindsey Group, in a note. In economic news, import prices rose 0.4 percent in January, more than the expected 0.2 percent increase. Export prices rose 0.1 percent last month, in line with estimates. preliminary consumer sentiment for February came in at 95.7, below the expected 98.5. Overseas, European stocks traded slightly higher, with the pan-European Stoxx 600 index advancing around 0.16 percent. In Asia, stocks closed mostly higher, as Chinese trade figures topped economist expectations.

(AFP) Boeing’s Indian unit is expected to be scaled in such a way that it reflects the amount of business Boeing wins there. — AP (Brad Nettles MBI) Entity is fourth separate country-specific business established after those in Britain, Australia and Saudi Arabia Boeing's new Indian unit will help the company win more business from local customers and mean more employment in the South Asian country, the head of the US defence firm's Indian business said on Friday. The new legal entity, announced this week, is the fourth separate country-specific business Boeing has established after setting up similar structures in Britain, Australia and Saudi Arabia. Boeing will hire more staff, most of them locals, but also bring in specialists from overseas as it looks to win new deals and grow the $500 million a year worth of products it currently sources from India, Boeing India president Pratyush Kumar told Reuters. He declined to say how many new jobs would be created. "This is to really create the full ecosystem throughout the lifecycle for our customers in India," he said ahead of an Indian airshow in Bengaluru next week. Kumar said the new entity, which Boeing hopes will also grow its manufacturing presence in the country, was designed for its Indian clients rather than those overseas. "In order to support US exports, we need to better support our Indian customers," he said.   'Made in India' dilemma Boeing, as well as rivals such as Europe's Airbus and Lockheed Martin of the United States, are looking to India, one of the world's largest arms importers, as a future source of growth as Western countries trim defence budgets. India is expected to spend $250 billion over the next decade to modernise its armed forces, but Prime Minister Narendra Modi has also said new deals must involve a share of local production to help the country grow its nascent defence industry. Industry sources say US manufacturers are still uncertain how to square the "Made in India" policy with US President Donald Trump's "America First" rhetoric against locating jobs abroad. Trump has criticised US companies that have moved manufacturing overseas and which then sell their products back to the United States. Boeing's Indian unit is expected to be scaled in such a way that it reflects the amount of business Boeing wins there. Lockheed Martin said this week it wanted to push ahead with plans to move production of its F-16 combat jets to India, but understood Trump's administration might want to take a "fresh look" at the proposal. Boeing has won several deals with India in recent years, including a roughly $2.5 billion contract to supply its Chinook and Apache helicopters, as well as an order for its P-8I maritime spy planes. It also has a joint venture with Tata Advanced Systems in aerospace. Kumar said Boeing was studying a recent request for information issued last month by the Indian Navy for 57 multi-role fighter jets for its aircraft carriers, and analysts expect it to pitch its F/A-18 Super Hornet planes. Industry sources say any deal would most likely depend on Boeing agreeing to build at least part of the jets in India. Share More > Vote ERROR: Macro /ads/dfp-ads is missing!

(NYSE: BA) filed its 2016 Form 10-K annual report with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Thursday. Like nearly all required filings for every company, the Boeing 10-K contains a range of detailed information that is often not included in quarterly press announcements or even quarterly SEC filings. We’ve read through the Boeing 10-K with an eye to finding some of those details that investors might not find in other documents. We paid special attention to the section of the 10-K related to risk factors. Here are some things we found that may not be on investors’ radar. Italic text indicates a direct quote from the filing. We enter into firm fixed-price aircraft sales contracts with indexed price escalation clauses which could subject us to losses if we have cost overruns or if increases in our costs exceed the applicable escalation rate. Boeing’s defense systems segment generated approximately 71% of 2016 revenues from fixed-price contracts. Cost-overruns (what Boeing calls reach-forward losses) totaled $1.13 billion last year on the KC-46A tanker fixed-price contract. In 2016, 23% of our revenues were earned pursuant to U.S. government contracts, which include foreign military sales through the U.S. government. Business conducted pursuant to such contracts is subject to extensive procurement regulations and other unique risks. In 2016, non-U.S. customers accounted for approximately 59% of our revenues. We expect that non-U.S. sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues for the foreseeable future. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, our airplane financing commitments totaled $14,847 million and $16,283 million. Boeing finances these commitments, in part, with debt. Rising interest rates will affect the company’s interest payments. Boeing paid $306 million in interest expense last year, an increase of more than 10% from 2015. Approximately 57,000 employees, which constitute 38% of our total workforce, were union represented as of December 31, 2016. Boeing currently has relationships with 11 U.S. unions and seven non-U.S. labor organizations. Union labor at the company’s suppliers may also affect the company’s ability to meet its commitments. The decrease in contractual backlog during 2016 and 2015 was primarily due to deliveries in excess of net orders. This is the company’s book-to-bill ratio expressed in dollars. Since the banner year of 2014, backlogs have been shrinking as new orders slow. Commercial contractual backlog at the end of 2016 is $416.2 billion, down from $440.12 billion in 2014 and $431.41 billion in 2015. Including the defense segment’s backlog, total contractual backlog for 2016 is $458.28 billion, down from $487.1 billion in 2014 and $476.6 billion in 2015. Many of our non-U.S. customers finance purchases through the Export-Import Bank of the United States. Following the expiration of the bank’s charter on June 30, 2015, the bank’s charter was reauthorized in December 2015. The bank is now authorized through September 30, 2019. However, until the U.S. Senate confirms members sufficient to reconstitute a quorum of the bank’s board of directors, the bank will not be able to approve any transaction totaling more than $10 million. Boeing may find itself in the position of having to fund additional commitments or entering into new financial arrangements with customers if the Ex-Im Bank doesn’t attain a quorum. This diverts liquidity from other places the company might prefer to use it.

(NYSE: BA) filed its 2016 Form 10-K with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The SEC form is pretty plain-looking, compared with what the printed version of annual report will look like: lots of big pictures and stylized pull-quotes. But the stuff that Boeing (and every other company) has to reveal is in the SEC filing, and while reading these often 100 or so page reports can at times be mind-numbing, there can be a big payoff. Warren Buffett has said on more than one occasion that he loves to curl up with companies’ annual reports. The way to get smarter, Buffett once said while holding up a stack of papers, is to “read 500 pages like this every day. That’s how knowledge builds up, like compound interest.” But most people don’t have time to read 500 pages a day of financial reporting documents (or they don’t think they do), so we went through the Boeing 10-K filing looking for some hidden gems of data. We found 10 and have presented them here. Here are a couple, with Boeing’s original text in italic type, along with our comments. In 2016, 23% of our revenues were earned pursuant to U.S. government contracts, which include foreign military sales through the U.S. government. Business conducted pursuant to such contracts is subject to extensive procurement regulations and other unique risks. In 2016, non-U.S. customers accounted for approximately 59% of our revenues. We expect that non-U.S. sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues for the foreseeable future. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, our airplane financing commitments totaled $14,847 million and $16,283 million. Boeing finances these commitments, in part, with debt. Rising interest rates will affect the company’s interest payments. Boeing paid $306 million in interest expense last year, an increase of more than 10% from 2015. The decrease in contractual backlog during 2016 and 2015 was primarily due to deliveries in excess of net orders. This is the company’s book-to-bill ratio expressed in dollars. Since the banner year of 2014, backlogs have been shrinking as new orders slow. Commercial contractual backlog at the end of 2016 is $416.2 billion, down from $440.12 billion in 2014 and $431.41 billion in 2015. Including the defense segment’s backlog, total contractual backlog for 2016 is $458.28 billion, down from $487.1 billion in 2014 and $476.6 billion in 2015.

AFP PHOTO   In Summary Conway said the Trump team was "aware" of the lawmakers' letter and was "reviewing that internally." Since his election in November, Trump has targeted a series of American multinationals by name (General Motors, Ford, Boeing, Lockheed and others) for moving production overseas or for allegedly overcharging the government. Advertisement By AGENCIES A key aide to Donald Trump was facing possible investigation Thursday after pitching the clothing line of the president's daughter Ivanka on television, with top lawmakers from both camps denouncing a major ethics breach and urging "disciplinary action." Speaking with the White House seal clearly visible over her shoulder, Kellyanne Conway gave Ivanka Trump's clothing a rave review during a Fox interview early Thursday, urging shoppers to "go buy Ivanka's stuff." "This is just a wonderful line," she said. "I own some of it. I fully -- I'm going to give a free commercial here. Go buy it today, everybody. You can find it online." Conway was clearly channelling the anger expressed a day earlier by the president himself, when he tweeted that Ivanka had been "treated so unfairly" by Nordstrom, an upscale department store chain that dropped her fashion brand. But to Washington traditionalists, Conway's direct pitch from the White House for a product line sold by the president's child seemed a jaw-dropping -- and possibly illegal -- misuse of presidential prestige. Democrat Elijah Cummings and Republican Jason Chaffetz -- both lawmakers on the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, which Chaffetz chairs -- led calls for Conway to face rebuke. "Conway's statements clearly violate the ethical principles for federal employees and are unacceptable," the congressmen said in a letter to the federal ethics chief, Walter Shaub, requesting that he recommend "appropriate disciplinary action" against her. "What she did was wrong, wrong, wrong," said Chaffetz on Twitter. The Office of Government Ethics, which Shaub heads, separately said it had been "receiving an extraordinary volume of contacts from citizens about recent events." Without mentioning Conway by name, it said it was reaching out to the appropriate government agencies who would decide whether to pursue the matter -- the established protocol when the OGE learns of "possible ethics violations." 'The law is clear' Conway said the Trump team was "aware" of the lawmakers' letter and was "reviewing that internally." She also told Fox News she had spoken with the president about the incident and that he "supports me 100 percent." "All I can say, at some point in your life, you ought to have a boss who treated me the way that the president is treating me today." White House press secretary Sean Spicer said Trump's aide had been "counseled" over the issue, without providing more detail. "Kellyanne Conway's White House Infomercial," as it was dubbed in a scathing New York Times editorial, again fanned debate over the unprecedented level to which the new president -- despite his protestations to the contrary -- has mixed politics, business and family, raising questions about conflicts of interest. For Noah Bookbinder, executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a watchdog group which filed a separate complaint, "the law is clear" on such matters. "This is just another example of what looks like a disturbing pattern of this administration acting to benefit the businesses of the president's family and supporters." Boycott calls Since his election in November, Trump has targeted a series of American multinationals by name (General Motors, Ford, Boeing, Lockheed and others) for moving production overseas or for allegedly overcharging the government. But his tweet targeting Nordstrom marked the first time he had complained directly about the business interests of one of his adult children. The tweet appeared both on Trump's personal account and on that of the presidency, @POTUS. The Nordstrom group, with 350 stores in the United States and Canada, has repeatedly denied any political motive to its dropping of Ivanka Trump's clothing line, saying it was motivated purely by "performance" considerations. Sales had fallen, particularly in last year's second half. But products carrying a Trump brand, including Ivanka's, have been boycotted by critics of the new president, leading to his complaint of a political motivation behind Nordstrom's move. TJX Companies, which operates the clothing store chains TJ Maxx and Marshalls, told AFP on Thursday it had instructed store employees no longer to display Ivanka Trump products separately. "The communication we sent to TJ Maxx and Marshalls in the US instructed stores to mix this line of merchandise into our racks, not to remove it from the sales floor," a spokesperson said. advertisement In the Headlines Besigye warns country on diversionary campaign Dr Besigye says there are serious political, economic and social issues that should be occupying Makerere staff oppose Shs300m payment to probe committee The academic staff association has greeted the payment with dismay considering that the National AG faults oil companies on sharing information   National 46 accounting officers face arrest over Shs46b   National World Day of the Sick - gov’t asked to focus on palliative care   59 minutes ago National Uganda receives Shs500m Tuberculosis machines   38 minutes ago Advertisement National Religious leaders, parents oppose govt policy on contraceptives National Public holds mock plenary, tips on climate change National FDC’s Alaso trounced in court World 500 West African troops get three-month Gambia extension World MPs, guards fight in S.African parliament as president Zuma addresses nation Advertisement Latest News National Uganda receives Shs500m Tuberculosis machines   National World Day of the Sick - gov’t asked to focus on palliative care   Jobs and Career Ask your life insurance adviser   Jobs and Career Workplace: Be loyal to your job   Jobs and Career Mistakes job seekers should avoid   Full Woman Mystery man at the office   Dining & Recipes Chili con carne   Advertisement From The East African Business Layoff fears as East African economies slow down   Magazine Luxury firm eyes East Africa's ultra wealthy   Business Sub-Saharan Africa fast becoming hotbed of unemployment   Business Agriculture remains East Africa’s greatest source of jobs   News Angolan president orders stadium stampede probe   Business Rwanda's January inflation at 7.4pc   Business Fraud hits Tanzania’s mobile money transfer   Advertisement Web Mail e-Paper 93.3 KFM Business Directory Sqoop Dembefm NTV Uganda Africa Review The East African Daily Nation The Citizen Business Daily About us Contact us Advertise with Us Terms of Use Nation Media Group
Home Industry Boeing eyes more Indian orders with new business unit Boeing eyes more Indian orders with new business unit Boeing's new Indian unit will help the company win more business from local customers and mean more employment in the South Asian country, the head of the U.S. defence firm's Indian business said on Friday. By: Reuters | New Delhi | Published: February 10, 2017 7:00 PM The new legal entity, announced this week, is the fourth separate country-specific business Boeing has established after setting up similar structures in Britain, Australia and Saudi Arabia. (Reuters) Boeing’s new Indian unit will help the company win more business from local customers and mean more employment in the South Asian country, the head of the U.S. defence firm’s Indian business said on Friday. The new legal entity, announced this week, is the fourth separate country-specific business Boeing has established after setting up similar structures in Britain, Australia and Saudi Arabia. Boeing will hire more staff, most of them locals, but also bring in specialists from overseas as it looks to win new deals and grow the $500 million a year worth of products it currently sources from India, Boeing India President Pratyush Kumar told Reuters. He declined to say how many new jobs would be created. “This is to really create the full ecosystem throughout the lifecycle for our customers in India,” he said ahead of an Indian airshow in Bengaluru next week. Kumar said the new entity, which Boeing hopes will also grow its manufacturing presence in the country, was designed for its Indian clients rather than those overseas. Watch This Also: “In order to support U.S. exports, we need to better support our Indian customers,” he said. ‘MADE IN INDIA’ DILEMMA Boeing, as well as rivals such as Europe’s Airbus and Lockheed Martin of the United States, are looking to India, one of the world’s largest arms importers, as a future source of growth as Western countries trim defence budgets. India is expected to spend $250 billion over the next decade to modernise its armed forces, but Prime Minister Narendra Modi has also said new deals must involve a share of local production to help the country grow its nascent defence industry. Industry sources say U.S. manufacturers are still uncertain how to square the “Made in India” policy with U.S. President Donald Trump’s “America First” rhetoric against locating jobs abroad. Trump has criticised U.S. companies that have moved manufacturing overseas and which then sell their products back to the United States. Boeing’s Indian unit is expected to be scaled in such a way that it reflects the amount of business Boeing wins there. Lockheed Martin said this week it wanted to push ahead with plans to move production of its F-16 combat jets to India, but understood Trump’s administration might want to take a “fresh look” at the proposal. Boeing has won several deals with India in recent years, including a roughly $2.5 billion contract to supply its Chinook and Apache helicopters, as well as an order for its P-8I maritime spy planes. It also has a joint venture with Tata Advanced Systems in aerospace. Kumar said Boeing was studying a recent request for information issued last month by the Indian Navy for 57 multi-role fighter jets for its aircraft carriers, and analysts expect it to pitch its F/A-18 Super Hornet planes. Industry sources say any deal would most likely depend on Boeing agreeing to build at least part of the jets in India. Please Wait while comments are loading...

Boeing eyes more Indian orders with new business unit By Tommy Wilkes Reuters 21 hrs ago (…) Courtesy Boeing F/A-18E/F Super Hornets, in a photo provided by Boeing. NEW DELHI  • Boeing's new Indian unit will help the company win more business from local customers and mean more employment in the South Asian country, the head of the U.S. defense firm's Indian business said on Friday. The new legal entity, announced this week, is the fourth separate country-specific business Boeing has established after setting up similar structures in Britain, Australia and Saudi Arabia. Boeing will hire more staff, most of them locals, but also bring in specialists from overseas as it looks to win new deals and grow the $500 million a year worth of products it currently sources from India, Boeing India President Pratyush Kumar told Reuters. He declined to say how many new jobs would be created. "This is to really create the full ecosystem throughout the lifecycle for our customers in India," he said ahead of an Indian airshow in Bengaluru next week. Kumar said the new entity, which Boeing hopes will also grow its manufacturing presence in the country, was designed for its Indian clients rather than those overseas. "In order to support U.S. exports, we need to better support our Indian customers," he said. 'Made in India' dilemma   Boeing, as well as rivals such as Europe's Airbus and Lockheed Martin of the United States, are looking to India, one of the world's largest arms importers, as a future source of growth as Western countries trim defense budgets. India is expected to spend $250 billion over the next decade to modernize its armed forces, but Prime Minister Narendra Modi has also said new deals must involve a share of local production to help the country grow its nascent defense industry. Industry sources say U.S. manufacturers are still uncertain how to square the "Made in India" policy with President Donald Trump's "America First" rhetoric against locating jobs abroad. Trump has criticized U.S. companies that have moved manufacturing overseas and which then sell their products back to the United States.

Lockheed Martin said this week it wanted to push ahead with plans to move production of its F-16 combat jets to India, but understood Trump's administration might want to take a "fresh look" at the proposal. Boeing has won several deals with India in recent years, including a roughly $2.5 billion contract to supply its Chinook and Apache helicopters, as well as an order for its P-8I maritime spy planes. It also has a joint venture with Tata Advanced Systems in aerospace. Kumar said Boeing was studying a recent request for information issued last month by the Indian Navy for 57 multi-role fighter jets for its aircraft carriers, and analysts expect it to pitch its F/A-18 Super Hornet planes. Industry sources say any deal would most likely depend on Boeing agreeing to build at least part of the jets in India. Business Briefing from St. Louis Post-Dispatch Make it your business.

Paul Waldman Gary Waters / Alamy Stock Photo February 10, 2017 ADVERTISEMENT Sign Up for Our free email newsletters 10 things you need to know today Today's best articles Today's top cartoons The good news newsletter The week's best photojournalism Daily business briefing Corporate CEOs are said to live in fear of President Trump's Twitter account. Woe unto those whose decision to outsource jobs or automate a factory should draw that 140-character Eye of Sauron. Companies like Boeing, Lockheed Martin, and Toyota have been the target of a Trump tweet and seen a quick drop in their stock prices. But maybe Trump's ability to punish corporations that grow wicked in his sight is overblown. Maybe they don't actually have much to fear from him. Maybe they can even stand up to him, and come out perfectly fine. That certainly seems to be the case with Nordstrom, the department store that made the fateful decision to stop carrying Ivanka Trump's clothing line — not for any political reason, they said, simply because sales were weak. Once their move became public, the administration swung into action. On Wednesday, the president tweeted, "My daughter Ivanka has been treated so unfairly by @Nordstrom. She is a great person — always pushing me to do the right thing! Terrible!" Then Kellyanne Conway went on Fox & Friends the next morning to do her part. "It's a wonderful line. I own some of it," she told the viewers. "I'm going to give a free commercial here. Go buy it today, everybody." Sure, endorsing products like that is a violation of government ethics rules, but they're shaking up the old Washington system! Then the inimitable Sean Spicer brought his special brand of indignation to poor suffering Ivanka's cause. "This is a direct attack on his policies and her name," he said. "She is being maligned because they have a problem with his policies." The only appropriate thing to do, it would seem, is to stock those clothes in your store whether anyone's buying them or not. Spicer may have been right, just not for the reason he thought: Sales of Ivanka-wear may well have declined because of her father's repellent run for president, even if Nordstrom was just making a pure business decision. Either way, Nordstrom is suffering the terrible consequences, right? Well...not exactly. Nordstrom's stock price actually rose immediately after Trump's tweet, and so far seems to be suffering no ill effects. And while there are probably some die-hard Ivanka fans out there who will refuse to cross the threshold of a Nordstrom ever again, there are also probably an equal number of liberals who will patronize the store more often now, for the same reason. Action, reaction. Consumer choices have been getting more and more politically charged in recent years, a trend that will only intensify in Trump's America. You probably haven't forgotten how Chick-fil-A incurred the wrath of liberals, and efforts to shut it out of major cities, when the ultra-conservative social views of its owners became widely known. So what happened? Visiting a Chick-fil-A became a handy way for Republican politicians to signal cultural affiliation with religious right voters, and plenty of conservative voters became even more bonded with the company, which continues to grow. That's just one case, and of course there are plenty of examples of successful boycotts. The most effective ones, however, are usually those that have a particular thing they're asking the company to do (or stop doing). Lately liberals have been pressuring companies to stop advertising on Breitbart, the white nationalist website that used to be run by Stephen Bannon, Trump's senior adviser — with considerable success. That's an easy step for a company to take to rid itself of a headache; it's much harder for a boycott to get consumers to abandon a brand for good. Just look at what happened around the Super Bowl. A number of the ads contained subtle or not-so-subtle digs at the president's policies, including one that portrayed a mother and daughter's journey north to America (from a lumber company) and another for Budweiser that told the immigrant story of the founder of parent company Anheuser-Busch. After it was unveiled, some conservatives tried to organize a Bud boycott, which went precisely nowhere, just as previous similar efforts had. Remember when religious right activists vowed to bring Starbucks to its knees because their Christmas cups were just red, without an appropriately Christmas-y image, like perhaps Jesus on the cross? Starbucks, too, is still standing — and it recently announced, in response to Trump's refugee ban, that it would hire 10,000 refugees over the next five years. I'm pretty sure that when a huge company like Anheuser-Busch considers airing a potentially controversial ad at the Super Bowl, they do some very careful thinking — and polling and focus-grouping — before going ahead. Which tells us that an implied dig at a president elected with a minority of the vote isn't necessarily such a risky move. And if Trump were to hit back, would it make any difference in the long term? Probably not. To be clear, I don't mean to suggest that it isn't spectacularly inappropriate for the president of the United States to single out an American company for scorn based on little more than something he saw on Morning Joe. But these days, being on Donald Trump's bad side may not necessarily be bad for business. Try 4 Risk-Free Issues of The Week magazine. ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT More Perspectives W.

REUTERS Boeing Co's new Indian unit will help the company win more business from local customers and mean more employment in the South Asian country, the head of the U.S. defence firm's Indian business said on Friday. The new legal entity, announced this week, is the fourth separate country-specific business Boeing has established after setting up similar structures in Britain, Australia and Saudi Arabia. Boeing will hire more staff, most of them locals, but also bring in specialists from overseas as it looks to win new deals and grow the $500 million a year worth of products it currently sources from India, Boeing India President Pratyush Kumar told Reuters. He declined to say how many new jobs would be created. "This is to really create the full ecosystem throughout the lifecycle for our customers in India," he said ahead of an Indian airshow in Bengaluru next week. Kumar said that the new entity, which Boeing hopes will also grow its manufacturing presence in the country, was designed for its Indian clients rather than those overseas. "In order to support U.S. exports, we need to better support our Indian customers," he said. Boeing, as well as rivals like Airbus and Lockheed Martin, are looking to India, one of the world's largest arms importers, as a future source of growth as Western countries trim defence budgets. India is expected to spend $250 billion over the next decade to modernise its armed forces, but Prime Minister Narendra Modi has also said that new deals must involve a share of local production to help the country grow its nascent defence industry. Lockheed Martin said this week it wants to push ahead with plans to move production of its F-16 combat jets to India, but understands President Donald Trump's administration may want to take a "fresh look" at the proposal. Trump has criticised U.S. companies that have moved manufacturing overseas and which then sell their products back to the United States. Boeing has won several deals with India in recent years including a roughly $2.5 billion contract to supply its Chinook and Apache helicopters, as well as an order for its P-8I maritime spy planes. It also has a joint venture with Tata Advanced Systems in aerospace. Kumar said Boeing was studying a recent request for information issued last month by the Indian Navy for 57 multi-role fighter jets for its aircraft carriers, and analysts expect it to pitch its F/A-18 Super Hornet planes.

REUTERS/Faisal Al Nasser REUTERS/Faisal Al Nasser Thursday, Feb 09, 2017 DUBAI: The Gulf will continue to be a key market for defence suppliers in 2017, according to several senior industry figures. This activity will be spurred by a “security environment that is as challenging as we have ever known,” with countries around the region facing “unprecedented challenges,” according to Robert S. Harward, Chief Executive of Lockheed Martin United Arab Emirates. With rising global tensions, international demand for defence and military products is increasing across the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries, according to a report released by Deloitte in January. As a result of this increasing insecurity, many countries have hiked their spending on next generation military equipment, with the UAE and Saudi Arabia leading the field in the GCC. Advertisement “International sales currently represent roughly 30 per cent of Boeing Defence, Space & Security’s business, and we see continued opportunities for growth, particularly in the Middle East and the Asia Pacific regions,” said Scott Day, Boeing Defence, Space & Security Communications, in an email to Gulf News. According to Theodore Karasik, a senior adviser to Gulf State Analytics, a geo-strategic consultancy based in Dubai, current industry trends show an increase in multiple markets, including not only aerospace but also cybersecurity, communications and riot control equipment. That being said, Karasik also noted that “America’s ITAR restrictions (International Traffic in Arms Regulations) still hurt Washington’s sales in the MENA region, especially to the GCC.” It is unclear what president Donald Trump intends to do with the existing regulations governing the export of arms, although analysts expect him to loosen restrictions in favour of a home build approach. One of the key challenges facing defence suppliers in 2017 is the reduction in spending by governments in the region, hurt by low oil prices. “Our focus remains on delivering the most affordable advanced technology solutions to provide our partners with critical full spectrum capabilities to help solve some of the most difficult security challenges,” noted Harward. Karasik also cited budgetary constraints as one of the key issues in defence this year. “The MENA countries, particularly the GCC, are undergoing transformations of their economies and thus are seeking to procure the best possible deals,” Karasik said, adding that the UAE’s domestic industry has helped “offset suppliers from outside of the region.” Matthew Cochran, Chairman of Defence Services Marketing Council, agrees with this sentiment about home-grown defence suppliers. “Having more “Made in the UAE” type defence and security companies that have capabilities with export potential, like Tawazun Dynamics and NIMR, will provide for a suitable future for regional GCC allied militaries,” said Cochran. For Karasik, in 2017 the opportunities for suppliers lie in “areas of technological issues.” “While there is increasing specialisation by arms sellers, there are requirements for unmanned systems, cyber tools, and communications that continue to be in the MENA region’s highest interest,” he added. “Today, we are working together with the UAE to support everything from aerospace to outer space,” noted Harward. According to Deloitte’s report, several Middle Eastern countries spend a significant percentage of their GDP on defence costs, with Oman and Saudi Arabia being two of the top three. With $85.4 billion in military expenditure in 2015, Saudi Arabia was also the fourth largest defence spender globally. by Ed Clowes Staff Reporter Gulf News 2017. All rights reserved. © Copyright Zawya.

For several months now, Air India’s board has been taking decisions without any independent directors - apart from functional directors, the two government nominees seem to be the only voices of sanity in the board meetings since last summer, when the five independent directors retired. Whether there are corporate governance issues at Air India a la Infosys is something the experts need to ponder over. We are bringing up this point to show how Air India’s owner, the government, is going around in circles, clueless about which leaking tap to fix in its rush to keep the airline under its fold. Someone needs to tell the Modi government to stop protecting Air India from possible privatisation, stop preening about its maiden operating profit (which was a first after the merger of the two erstwhile airlines in 2015-16), control the urge to pump in yet more of taxpayers’ money into this black hole – and address the basic issues plaguing the national carrier first. If after months of back-and-forth the government is still undecided about who to nominate as independent directors on the airline’s board, is it all serious about making Air India self-sustainable? Perhaps the attempt should be to shutter the airline now, when it has shown at least one year of operational profit, instead of waiting endlessly for the bleeding behemoth to shudder and pass out. Representational imgae Here’s another grandiose plan of this government: get 19 public sector banks to convert their loan of about Rs 20,000 crore to the ailing Air India into equity. The airline has been in negotiations with these banks to take equity in lieu of their exposure. The total interest outgo of Rs 4,000 crore each year for AI could be reduced by a fourth if this ambitious proposal works. The total loan on Air India’s books is Rs 46,570.35 crore so a little less than half is sought to be restructured through the Sustainable Structuring of Stressed Assets (S4A) scheme where banks are being asked to take equity. The only question is, should the government be forcing PSU banks – who are already over burdened with NPAs – to take on more through this S4A scheme? Why should the banks suffer for historical mismanagement of Air India? Not only this. Believe it or not, Air India also needs more fresh loans since it still has to take deliveries of six Dreamliners (Boeing 787s) and three Boeing 777 aircraft till 2017-18, orders for which were placed during the earlier mega aircraft order of 68 Boeing and 33 Airbus aircraft. Here again, the government is nudging state insurer LIC to advance fresh loans. Loans to cover existing loans, equity in lieu of loans – the entire financial restructuring plan of the airline should be scrapped. Because in case the banks oblige and take equity in this loss making airline which looks an unlikely candidate for a turnaround, they will be left with worthless paper. Ditto for LIC. Last week, Minister of State for Civil Aviation, Jayant Sinha, said at an event that the carrier’s debt needs to be reduced and its balance sheet restructured for it to turn around. He also noted for good measures that there was a need to improve customer service, strengthen corporate governance practices and put in a professional management. So when is the basic minimum corporate governance to be infused into Air India? When will it get a set of eminent men and women as independent directors? In the same speech, newspapers quoted Sinha as saying that Air India’s non-core assets needs to be put to best use, the airline needs to work on route optimisation while adding that the overall transformation of Air India, being done with a combination of steps, has started yielding results. The minister obviously knows of a miracle Air India will perform in just three months to March to show such confidence in Air India’s improved financial performance. Because till now in the nine months this fiscal, there is little indication of Air India being on the road to operational profit. The target Air India had set itself for FY17 is Rs 1,086 crore operating profit. This would require the airline to make Rs 11 crore daily operating profit in this quarter alone. When in the first nine months of the fiscal year, it made no operating profit but an operating loss of Rs 161 crore – or a daily operating loss of about Rs 58 lakh. Now, a look at some operational parameters. As per DGCA data, Air India’s combined OTP (on time performance) at four metro airports has been the worst among all major domestic airlines in each month of calendar 2016 except in October when GoAir was worse. In November, the OTP of Air India across these airports was 67.7 percent which means every third flight from these airports was delayed. Another metric – bums on seats or passenger load factor – also does not favour Air India. This denotes the number of passengers as a percentage of total number of seats on an aircraft. In five of the 11 months of 2016, Air India was the second lowest (Vistara had the least PLF among national airlines). In the remaining six months, AI was ahead of Vistara and the Jet Group by a small margin. This means competition was able to entice flyers far more than AI in most instances. This, despite AI having a hub and spoke model which ensures better domestic connectivity than other airlines which follow a point-to-point connectivity model and also the fact that on most occasions, AI was matching fares with competition. The only consolation in the 11 months of 2016 under review is that the load factor for AI did not fall below 70 percent, which means it was flying at least 7 in 10 seats full at any given time. Even in market share, the airline has had a mixed year. DGCA data show its share of the domestic market fell from 16 percent in January to 12.9 percent in November. If even after these insipid details about Air India’s financial performance, its operational bumbling and service standards fail to warn banks and they are actually forced to succumb to the S4A scheme, there will likely be more red ink on their balance sheets. The colour red already defines Air India’s balance sheet. #Air india#Corporate governance issues#Jayant sinha#Minister of state for civil aviation#Modi government#Npas#Privatisation#Public sector banks#Sustainable structuring of stressed assets Also See Bank of India posts Rs 101.72 cr profit for Q3 vs loss last year on lower provisions Budget 2017: Govt to infuse Rs 10,000 cr in PSU banks in FY18 Budget 2017-18 highlights: Arun Jaitley offers good blueprint for Bharat, not much for India Infosys backs Vishal Sikka, downplays governance concerns, rift between founders and board Top Stories Uttar Pradesh Election 2017 LIVE: Western UP records 39.43% voter turnout till 1 pm; Mayawati claims BSP will win 1st phase K Pandiarajan: Minister Who Jumped Ship to Rattle Chinnamma's Camp MSG Lion Heart 2 'review': Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh launches another surgical strike on cinema Women scientists in India: What we learnt from a year of lab-hopping across the country Meeting a financial planner for first time?

India is expected to spend $250 billion over the next decade to modernise its armed forces, but Prime Minister Narendra Modi has also said new deals must involve a share of local production to help the country grow its nascent defence industry. Industry sources say US manufacturers are still uncertain how to square the "Made in India" policy with US President Donald Trump's "America First" rhetoric against locating jobs abroad. Trump has criticised US companies that have moved manufacturing overseas and which then sell their products back to the United States. Boeing's Indian unit is expected to be scaled in such a way that it reflects the amount of business Boeing wins there. Lockheed Martin said this week it wanted to push ahead with plans to move production of its F-16 combat jets to India, but understood Trump's administration might want to take a "fresh look" at the proposal. Boeing has won several deals with India in recent years, including a roughly $2.5 billion contract to supply its Chinook and Apache helicopters, as well as an order for its P-8I maritime spy planes. It also has a joint venture with Tata Advanced Systems in aerospace. Kumar said Boeing was studying a recent request for information issued last month by the Indian Navy for 57 multi-role fighter jets for its aircraft carriers, and analysts expect it to pitch its F/A-18 Super Hornet planes. Industry sources say any deal would most likely depend on Boeing agreeing to build at least part of the jets in India. Stay on top of business news with The Economic Times App. Download it Now!

Photo: Reuters mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 2:50 PM, February 10, 2017 Updated: 7:30 PM, February 10, 2017 NEW DELHI - Boeing's <BA.N> new Indian unit will help the company win more business from local customers and mean more employment in the South Asian country, the head of the U.S. defense firm's Indian business said on Friday. The new legal entity, announced this week, is the fourth separate country-specific business Boeing has established after setting up similar structures in Britain, Australia and Saudi Arabia. Boeing will hire more staff, most of them locals, but also bring in specialists from overseas as it looks to win new deals and grow the $500 million a year worth of products it currently sources from India, Boeing India President Pratyush Kumar told Reuters. He declined to say how many new jobs would be created. "This is to really create the full ecosystem throughout the lifecycle for our customers in India," he said ahead of an Indian airshow in Bengaluru next week. Kumar said the new entity, which Boeing hopes will also grow its manufacturing presence in the country, was designed for its Indian clients rather than those overseas. "In order to support U.S. exports, we need to better support our Indian customers," he said.

Home Industry Boeing’s big ‘Make in India’ plan: Win more business from local customers and create more jobs Boeing’s big ‘Make in India’ plan: Win more business from local customers and create more jobs Boeing Co's new Indian unit will help the company win more business from local customers and mean more employment in the South Asian country, the head of the U.S. defence firm's Indian business said on Friday. By: Reuters | New Delhi | Published: February 10, 2017 12:36 PM “This is to really create the full ecosystem throughout the lifecycle for our customers in India,” he said ahead of an Indian airshow in Bengaluru next week. (Reuters) Boeing Co’s new Indian unit will help the company win more business from local customers and mean more employment in the South Asian country, the head of the U.S. defence firm’s Indian business said on Friday. The new legal entity, announced this week, is the fourth separate country-specific business Boeing has established after setting up similar structures in Britain, Australia and Saudi Arabia. Boeing will hire more staff, most of them locals, but also bring in specialists from overseas as it looks to win new deals and grow the $500 million a year worth of products it currently sources from India, Boeing India President Pratyush Kumar told Reuters. He declined to say how many new jobs would be created. “This is to really create the full ecosystem throughout the lifecycle for our customers in India,” he said ahead of an Indian airshow in Bengaluru next week. Kumar said that the new entity, which Boeing hopes will also grow its manufacturing presence in the country, was designed for its Indian clients rather than those overseas. “In order to support US exports, we need to better support our Indian customers,” he said. Boeing, as well as rivals like Airbus and Lockheed Martin, are looking to India, one of the world’s largest arms importers, as a future source of growth as Western countries trim defence budgets. India is expected to spend $250 billion over the next decade to modernise its armed forces, but Prime Minister Narendra Modi has also said that new deals must involve a share of local production to help the country grow its nascent defence industry. Lockheed Martin said this week it wants to push ahead with plans to move production of its F-16 combat jets to India, but understands President Donald Trump’s administration may want to take a “fresh look” at the proposal. You may also like to watch this Trump has criticised U.S. companies that have moved manufacturing overseas and which then sell their products back to the United States. Boeing has won several deals with India in recent years including a roughly $2.5 billion contract to supply its Chinook and Apache helicopters, as well as an order for its P-8I maritime spy planes. It also has a joint venture with Tata Advanced Systems in aerospace. Kumar said Boeing was studying a recent request for information issued last month by the Indian Navy for 57 multi-role fighter jets for its aircraft carriers, and analysts expect it to pitch its F/A-18 Super Hornet planes.

The technology, which improves the ability of planes to share location information, would allow for decreased spacing and improved efficiency at major airports with high traffic. (Ian Terry / The Herald) Aerospace blog NASA is testing technology to help airlines fly more efficiently Dan Catchpole Thu Feb 9th, 2017 10:00pm News You must sign in or register to continue reading content. MOSES LAKE — The airplane dropped down low over Central Washington. Snow-covered farming towns peeked through holes in the clouds hugging the ground. Many of them are too small to have a traffic signal. The streets are not crowded around Moses Lake. However, flight paths used by commercial jets are becoming increasingly congested — a problem expected to grow as more and more Americans travel by air. Addressing that problem is what brought researchers from NASA and Honeywell over Moses Lake and the adjacent Grant County International Airport. They are about halfway through a month of test flights for technology that promises to cut down on congestion over busy airports. “No passenger likes holding in the air. Airlines don’t like spending extra fuel waiting to land,” said Leighton Quon, a NASA researcher with the Air Traffic Management Technology Demonstration-1, which includes the software being tested over Moses Lake. The new software is part of the Federal Aviation Administration’s ambitious NextGen initiative to modernize how flights are managed in America’s skies. The test flights involve three airplanes — a business jet, Honeywell’s Boeing 757 research plane and a United Airlines 737 — making repeated practice approaches at the Grant County airport. The nimble business jet — a Dassault Falcon — leads the way, broadcasting its speed and position to the 757 and 737. Tablets in the cockpits of the two Boeing jets tell the pilots exactly how fast they should be flying and how much space to keep between the plane ahead. That allows them to fly far closer than the current system, which relies on air traffic controllers on the ground telling pilots the speeds and distances to maintain. Controllers “are on their own, eyeballs on the screen,” Quon said. They put safety ahead of efficiency. That means accidents are prevented but sometimes passengers are stuck overnight at the airport. The Air Traffic Management Technology Demonstration-1 includes the flight deck software and tools for controllers on the ground. NASA finished developing those ground-based technologies, which the FAA plans to test in the real world in 2019. NASA hopes to hand over the flight deck tool to the FAA for certification in the fall of this year. The benefit is not only for fliers in and out of New York, Los Angeles and other high-traffic areas. Congestion in those hubs ripples through airlines’ networks across the country. So, a plane stuck in a holding pattern due to bad weather around New York could cause delays and missed connections across the country. The project is expected to cost $100 million over five years. That is a drop compared to the roughly $1 billion the FAA is spending each year on NextGen. Critics have attacked the program as costing too much and delivering too little. During a meeting Thursday with airline executives, President Donald Trump said the initiative is “totally out of whack” and overpriced, according to news reports. Proponents say that bringing air traffic control into the 21st century cannot be done on the cheap, and the benefits will outweigh the costs. “Today’s flight tests demonstrate the success of NextGen technologies, which are contributing to a safer and more efficient air traffic control system,” said U.S. Rep. Rick Larsen, the senior Democrat on the House’s Aviation Subcommittee. “I will continue working to ensure NextGen moves forward in a way that supports safer, faster flying throughout America’s airspace system.” The current system is still rooted in the very first way-finding aids deployed nearly a century ago, when bonfires on the ground directed mail pilots from one airfield to the next. The fires were replaced by electric lights and later became radar beacons, which pilots still use today to find their way between airports. Radar and radio made for safer and more efficient landings and takeoffs at airports. However, they still rely on air traffic controllers manually sorting and scheduling flights coming and going. Air traffic management tools and other NextGen innovations promise a more efficient system, “but that future is still far off,” said Rui Neiva, a policy analyst at the Eno Center for Transportation, a think tank in Washington, D.C. A report issued last November by the U.S. Department of Transportation’s Inspector General raised concerns about the program’s ability to deliver on its promises.

Syahindah main bola sepak Advertisement More stories                Tools Increase Text Decrease Text Reset Text Print Article Dennis Muilenburg, CEO of Boeing Company, speaks to members of the press at Trump Tower in New York January 17, 2017. — Reuters picNEW YORK, Feb 10 — Boeing Co must sell more 777 and 787 jetliners to keep production plans on track, despite a US$13.8 billion (RM61.25 billion) order that landed earlier yesterday, its chief executive said. The order from high-profile customer Singapore Airlines is a strong endorsement of both planes, and could lift sales in a sluggish market if other carriers follow Singapore Air's lead, analysts said. But the win over rival Airbus did not lessen two big risks Boeing faces, Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg said yesterday at a conference in New York hosted by Cowen and Co. Sales of Boeing's highly profitable 777s have slowed so much that Boeing is cutting production 40 per cent this year to cope as it begins switching to the successor 777X model that Singapore Airlines ordered. “When I take a look at risk areas, filling out the 777 bridge is the area that we're focused on,” Muilenburg said, referring to the production spanning the two models. Boeing also must sell more 787s so it can proceed with plans to lift output to 14 planes a month from 12 in the next few years, Muilenburg said. That increase has looked iffy and some investors have worried Boeing would abandon it. Muilenburg said Boeing still plans to lift 787 output and currently does not envision a scenario that would require cutting 787 output below 12 a month. Boeing shares were up 0.4 per cent at US$164.42 in afternoon trading. The Singapore Airlines order is a boost for the 787 assembly line, but it does not help with slow 777 sales, since the order is for the newer 777X model. Muilenburg said the airplane market is still "very healthy" with passenger traffic growing five per cent to six per cent a year, well ahead of GDP rates. But airlines have deferred delivery of about two per cent of Boeing's backlog, double the figure Muilenburg cited in July, though well below historical averages. Boeing has already cut 777 output to seven planes a month from 8.3, and will trim it to five a month in August. Deliveries — which generate the bulk of airline payments — will actually fall to about 3.5 a month as Boeing builds 777X test planes in the next few years, he said. Even with those reductions, Boeing has to sell a few more 777s to fill out production this year and has 10 per cent of production unsold in 2018 and 2019. Those figures include the planned sale of 80 planes to Iran, including 15 Boeing 777s, Muilenburg said. Muilenburg voiced confidence that the Iran sale would go through despite the potential political and bureaucratic hurdles. “These are airplanes that support American manufacturing jobs,” he said. “The economic value to the US is real.” He also saw prospects for more US defence sales, noting “re-emerging strength” in the defense budget. And, he said Boeing's KC-46 aerial tanker for the US Air Force, which has incurred about US$2.4 billion in cost overruns, is expected to begin generating positive cash flow next year. — Reuters                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Bursa Malaysia to trade higher next week Amazon warns that trade protectionism could hurt business China regulator still plans oil futures, weighs easing equity curbs Dollar rises on hopes for Trump tax reform Ringgit likely to trade easier vis-à-vis greenback next week If Trump hits China, regional demand would ease blow in Asia Bursa Malaysia opens easier Sri Lanka eyes China free trade deal this year, PM to visit in May Another day, another mall: How KL Gateway Mall hopes to succeed in a crowded market Ringgit opens slightly lower against US dollar Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: ‘The White Helmets’ filmmakers discuss ‘Muslim ban’ Reuters Video: Obama, Richard Branson go kiteboarding Reuters Video: ‘Babies’ on board for Beyonce and Jay Z Reuters Video: ‘Babies’ on board for Beyonce and Jay Z Reuters Video: ‘The White Helmets’ filmmakers discuss ‘Muslim ban’ Reuters Video: Obama, Richard Branson go kiteboarding Related Articles Boeing front-runner for Singapore Airlines’ order Trump calls on Boeing to offer quote for F-35 rival Boeing promises Trump to control costs on Air Force One Trump says Boeing’s Air Force One order should be canned Boeing names GE’s McAllister CEO of commercial airplanes unit Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2017 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | RecomN - Local Services

Boeing was nearing an order for at least 35 wide-body aircraft from Singapore Air, Bloomberg News reported Wednesday. Deliveries of the jets will start as early as in the financial year ending March 2021, the carrier said, adding it also has options to buy six more of each of the two models. The new deal would provide a critical boost to two high-profile Boeing products amid a tough market for twin-aisle jets. The Chicago-based company has been working hard to land sales of its upgraded 777X family after twice announcing it would cut output of current models. The new aircraft will replace some of Singapore Air’s aging Boeing planes such as the 777-300ER, while giving the carrier’s low-cost units rights to jets not yet on the market. “Singapore is a deeply respected long-haul carrier, both in terms of brand quality and technical proficiency,” said  Richard Aboulafia, an aerospace analyst with Fairfax, Virginia-based Teal Group. “It would be a fantastic endorsement.” Shares of the airline rose 1.4 percent to SGD9.94 yesterday in Singapore trading before the announcement. Singapore Air has ordered 67 of the A350-900 jets, including an ultra-long range version, as it courts business travelers with non-stop service to markets such as New York and Los Angeles. The Asian carrier’s current fleet includes 10 A350s, which Airbus says consume 25 percent less fuel than Boeing’s 777 aircraft, with 57 more on order. The airline already has 30 787-10s on order, according to Boeing’s website. Singapore Air has also reviewed a proposed, longer version of the twin-engine 777 that would carry as many as 450 passengers, a load previously handled only by four-engine jumbo jets, Bloomberg News reported Wednesday. Buffeted by marquee Middle Eastern peers such as Emirates and regional budget operators, the only Asian carrier to have flown the Concorde has said it will maintain vigilance over its costs. Singapore Air, following two consecutive quarters of decline in profits, said Tuesday that 2017 will be another challenging year amid “tepid global economic conditions and geopolitical concerns.” The carrier is the launch customer for the 787-10, the first Boeing jetliner to be manufactured solely at its new North Charleston, South Carolina, campus. Deliveries are slated to begin next year. Singapore Air’s unit Scoot currently flies the carbon-composite 787-800 and 787-900 variants of the Dreamliners.

New direct route between U.S. and Cork to be set up - Irish Sun Issue 042/15 Irish Sun        http://www.irishsun.com   Ireland News Breaking International News Breaking Business News Europe Sports News Dublin News Economics News Belfast News Breaking Internet News Web Site Development News Healthcare News Ireland News Utilities News New direct route between U.S. and Cork to be set up Irish Sun Friday 10th February, 2017 • NAI is to set up a direct route between U.S. and Cork this year • Move comes after Trump administration granted the permission to NAI to do so • More cities from U.S. and Ireland to soon be added to the route map CORK, Ireland - After U.S. President Donald Trump’s confirmation on having no objection to plans by a budget airline to enter the transatlantic market, Ireland is all set for a tourism boost.  Sean Spicer, White House Press Secretary, confirmed the nod by the country’s new administration on Norwegian Air International’s (NAI) plans to set up new U.S.-Irish routes. NAI plans to have direct services from Cork and Shannon to Boston and New York. Other routes may soon be added to the list, officials said. The airline has hailed the statement coming from Trump’s office as “a correct understanding” of the benefits that the Irish-U.S. service is to offer. The first direct route from U.S. to Cork is to be launched by the NAI this summer. Commenting on the plan, Spicer said, “From what I understand, we are talking about a deal where 50 percent of the crew and pilots are based in the United States. They fly Boeing aircraft. It is a major economic interest in the United States in the agreement right now.” NAI official Stuart Buss has welcomed the statement which has finally ended all speculation over how the new U.S. administration would respond to the plan. He said, “We’re pleased with the U.S. Press Secretary’s correct understanding of Norwegian and Norwegian Air International. No other foreign airline invests more in the American economy or creates more American jobs than Norwegian.” “We currently have 500 U.S. based cabin crew and are the only foreign airline to be recruiting American pilots, all of which are hired under local laws and regulations with competitive packages.” “We also operate an all-Boeing fleet of more than 120 Boeing aircraft, with another 120 on order generating further economic benefits and jobs in the U.S.” “Norwegian is doing exactly what the U.S. administration wants - we are creating hundreds of American jobs in the air and on the ground, he said.” Only last December, the U.S. had ended a year-long stand-off with Ireland and the EU when it granted an operating license for NAI to commence its transatlantic services. This, however, is all set to ignite a price war on transatlantic services. Meanwhile, fares for the new route will shortly be made public.  After this route, NAI plans to launch a service from Cork to New York in 2018. Cork Airport managing director, Niall MacCarthy, has praised this decision and called it “a great win for Open Skies.” Housing Minister Simon Coveney has also described the decision as “a landmark development” for Cork. Now, with a surge in tourism expected between Ireland and U.S., Norwegian may also slash its average return fares on transatlantic services. Taoiseach Enda Kenny has said that the entry of Norwegian to the transatlantic market holds immense potential. He stated, “The opportunity for Norwegian to fly from Ireland to the States will have the capacity to do for long haul what Ryanair did for (European) short haul with enormous opportunities for both sides.” Cork’s Sen Jerry Buttimer said, “Cork has been working for 25 years to get a transatlantic service and it is critical that Norwegian is allowed to deliver it.” Previously, U.S. trade unions had strongly opposed the entry of Norwegian to the transatlantic market as they believed that it would undermine the existing U.S. crew and ground handler contracts.

While that order is a boost for the 787 assembly line, it does not help with slow sales of the 777, since the order is for the newer 777X model. Boeing recently cut current 777 production about 16 percent to seven a month. It plans another 29 percent cut by mid-year. But Boeing still needs to sell more 777s to fill production slots as it switches to the 777X over the next few years.

"We still have work to do." Boeing shares were up 0.5 percent at $164.65 in afternoon trading. What do you think? Click the button below to comment on this article.

REUTERS/Stephanie KeithMore By Alwyn Scott NEW YORK (Reuters) - Boeing Co <BA.N> must sell more 777 and 787 jetliners to keep production plans on track, despite a $13.8 billion order that landed earlier on Thursday, its chief executive said. The order from high-profile customer Singapore Airlines <SIAL.SI> is a strong endorsement of both planes, and could lift sales in a sluggish market if other carriers follow Singapore Air's lead, analysts said. But the win over rival Airbus <AIR.PA> did not lessen two big risks Boeing faces, Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg said on Thursday at a conference in New York hosted by Cowen and Co. Sales of Boeing's highly profitable 777s have slowed so much that Boeing is cutting production 40 percent this year to cope as it begins switching to the successor 777X model that Singapore Airlines ordered. "When I take a look at risk areas, filling out the 777 bridge is the area that we're focused on," Muilenburg said, referring to the production spanning the two models. Boeing also must sell more 787s so it can proceed with plans to lift output to 14 planes a month from 12 in the next few years, Muilenburg said. That increase has looked iffy and some investors have worried Boeing would abandon it. Muilenburg said Boeing still plans to lift 787 output and currently does not envision a scenario that would require cutting 787 output below 12 a month. Boeing shares were up 0.4 percent at $164.42 in afternoon trading. The Singapore Airlines order is a boost for the 787 assembly line, but it does not help with slow 777 sales, since the order is for the newer 777X model. Muilenburg said the airplane market is still "very healthy" with passenger traffic growing 5 percent to 6 percent a year, well ahead of GDP rates. But airlines have deferred delivery of about 2 percent of Boeing's backlog, double the figure Muilenburg cited in July, though well below historical averages. Boeing has already cut 777 output to 7 planes a month from 8.3, and will trim it to 5 a month in August. Deliveries - which generate the bulk of airline payments - will actually fall to about 3.5 a month as Boeing builds 777X test planes in the next few years, he said. Even with those reductions, Boeing has to sell a few more 777s to fill out production this year and has 10 percent of production unsold in 2018 and 2019. Those figures include the planned sale of 80 planes to Iran, including 15 Boeing 777s, Muilenburg said. Muilenburg voiced confidence that the Iran sale would go through despite the potential political and bureaucratic hurdles. "These are airplanes that support American manufacturing jobs," he said. "The economic value to the U.S. is real." He also saw prospects for more U.S. defense sales, noting "re-emerging strength" in the defense budget. And, he said Boeing's KC-46 aerial tanker for the U.S. Air Force, which has incurred about $2.4 billion in cost overruns, is expected to begin generating positive cash flow next year.

Expand west to the largest aviation market. Price the cheapest seats at $10. Offer business class up front for those willing to pay. A leader among ultra low-cost airlines, Ryanair had global ambitions. The trans-Atlantic routes have long been the province of the largest full-service carriers, which fill their premium cabins with the rich and famous and famously rich. As one of Europe's biggest airlines, any move by Ryanair into that world could have further upended fares by adding more capacity to an already crowded field. Yet O'Leary always found a reason not to pull the trigger. "I don't believe long haul, low fares, no frills works," he said in 2008. "Because there's always going to be 10 or 15 per cent of the market in long haul who will pay whatever it costs for a business-class service." Despite periodic teases of new U.S. flights, Ryanair did not move to acquire any aircraft model beyond the Boeing 737s it flies exclusively. In 2015, Ryanair made noises again, this time causing a stir when it said board members had approved plans to move ahead with trans-Atlantic flights — a logical progression given the airline's steady growth. That led to a reversal three days later (a delay the company blamed partly on St. Patrick's Day observances) when directors quashed the notion with a terse statement: "In the light of recent press coverage, the board of Ryanair Holdings P.L.C. wishes to clarify that it has not considered or approved any trans-Atlantic project and does not intend to do so." But now it's 2017, and probably too late for different reasons. Much has changed over the Atlantic in recent years amid a sharp decline in jet fuel prices. The trans-Atlantic market now sees a surge of low-cost flying from the likes of Norwegian Air, WOW Air, WestJet Airlines and Air Canada's discount Rouge unit. Air Canada itself has bolstered international flying, too. Even JetBlue Airways is mulling whether to cross the ocean. For now, Ryanair has shelved its trans-Atlantic plans and is scouring growth opportunities closer to home. The Dublin-based carrier, which carries about 116 million passengers annually, has its sights set on 200 million by 2024 with almost 400 new Boeing aircraft on order. "As there is plenty of capacity and growth opportunities for Ryanair in Europe, we are solely focused on European growth currently," Ryanair spokesperson Robin Kiely said in an email. For years, O'Leary cited an inability to acquire a fuel-efficient aircraft for Atlantic routes. Ryanair was unlikely to get a price from manufacturers it would like, he explained in a 2014 interview with Bloomberg News, due to the market popularity of new, more fuel-efficient aircraft such as Boeing's 787. The CEO also cited the torrid growth of the three large Middle Eastern carriers, Emirates, Qatar Airways and Etihad Airways. Emirates flies between the U.S. and Italy and plans to begin a new route from Athens to Newark, N.J., in March, two routes that have drawn fierce condemnation from U.S. carriers complaining the Gulf carriers are state-supported. Even setting all that aside, flights to America were still a strategic stretch for Ryanair. As with Dallas-based Southwest, Ryanair's competitive advantages stem from short flights, which allow for more daily flight segments per airplane. Crossing the Atlantic would put a significant crimp in that. "They wouldn't be able to replicate their massive short-haul cost advantage on long-haul flights," said Seth Kaplan, a managing partner at trade journal Airline Weekly. And, even with the cost benefits they enjoy over full-service carriers, low-cost airlines such as Ryanair and Spirit Airlines confront a revenue disadvantage for another reason: the longer the trip, the more that frills matter. "Some customers who are willing to put up with spartan service on two-hour flights aren't willing to put up with it on seven-hour flights," Kaplan said.

The new planes, valued at US$13.8 billion (S$19.5 billion) - based on catalogue prices - will support additional growth and fleet modernisation through the next decade, SIA said in an announcement after trading hours yesterday. The impending order for 20 B777-9s and 19 B787s comes with an option for 12 more aircraft. Delivery will start from 2020. When the actual deal is inked, it will be SIA's biggest aircraft order since May 2013, when it announced a US$17 billion order for 60 aircraft. "Today's major order for wide-body aircraft enables us to continue operating a modern and fuel-efficient fleet, providing the SIA Group with additional expansion opportunities to ensure that we retain our industry-leading position," said chief executive Goh Choon Phong. Apart from investing for the future, the order demonstrates SIA's commitment to further grow the Singapore hub, as SIA will be able to offer even more travel options for customers, said Mr Goh. SIA works closely with Changi Airport Group to offer convenient flight timings and minimal waiting times, to encourage more travellers to break their flights in Singapore. Its budget arms Scoot and Tigerair also cooperate closely to provide similar options. SIA's aircraft commitment to Boeing is an important win for the American firm, which competes aggressively with its European rival Airbus for plane orders. In addition to 30 previously-ordered B787-10s, SIA has outstanding orders with Airbus for five A380-800s and 57 A350-900s. Regional arm SilkAir has outstanding orders with Boeing for 37 single-aisle B737 MAX 8s. Long-haul budget carrier Scoot has orders with Boeing for eight B787s. Tigerair, which operates short-haul budget flights, has bought 39 A320neos. SIA's announcement comes two days after it reported a 35.6 per cent drop in year-on-year profits for the three months from October to December, although operating profits increased by 1.7 per cent. StrategicAero Research chief consultant Saj Ahmad said many of the new planes will likely replace the airline's ageing A330 and A380 fleets as well of some of its early B777-30ERs. "The challenge for SIA, however, remains the same - driving up yields with fuller cabins amidst a backdrop of fare depression and possibly rising fuel bills as oil continues to spike northward," he said. A version of this article appeared in the print edition of The Straits Times on February 10, 2017, with the headline 'SIA to buy 39 Boeing planes valued at $19.5 billion'.

Quotes in the article Boeing Co BA ▲ 166.23 +1.95 +1.19% Cowen Group Inc COWN ▼ 15.25 -0.05 -0.33% Singapore Airlines Ltd SINGY ▼ 13.99 -0.01 -0.07% Slow 777 sales are one of the top risks facing Boeing in the next few years, Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg said on Thursday at a conference in New York hosted by Cowen and Co. Boeing also must sell more 787s so it can proceed with plans to lift output to 14 planes a month from 12 in the next few years, he said, adding that there is no scenario in which Boeing envisions cutting production of the 787 to less than 12 a month. Earlier Thursday, Boeing won a provisional order for 20 777-9 and 19 787-10 wide-body planes from Singapore Airlines Ltd (SIAL.SI), worth $13.8 billion at list prices, beating rival Airbus (AIR.PA). While that order is a boost for the 787 assembly line, it does not help with slow sales of the 777, since the order is for the newer 777X model. Boeing recently cut current 777 production about 16 percent to seven a month. It plans another 29 percent cut by mid-year. But Boeing still needs to sell more 777s to fill production slots as it switches to the 777X over the next few years. "When I take a look at risk areas, filling out the 777 bridge is the area that we're focused on," Muilenburg said, referring to the production spanning the two models. "We still have work to do." Boeing shares were up 0.5 percent at $164.65 in afternoon trading.

Matthew Otero AP President Donald Trump visited U.S. Central Command at MacDill Air Force base Feb. 6. Tampa Bay Times 1 of 2 i By Amy Sherman PolitiFact Florida LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story President Donald Trump told military commanders in Tampa that he will deliver new airplanes at a massive savings to taxpayers. “We're going to be loading it up with beautiful new planes and beautiful new equipment,” he said at U.S. Central Command at MacDill Air Force Base on Monday. “You have been lacking a little equipment. We are going to load it up. You are going to get a lot of equipment. Believe me.” Trump then gave himself credit for saving millions of tax dollars during his first two weeks in office: “But we will ensure no taxpayer dollars are wasted. I have already saved more than $700 million when I got involved in the negotiation on the F-35. You know about that.” The savings with the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter are real, but they were in the works before Trump cried foul about the price tag. A Trump spokesman did not reply for this fact-check. (The Washington Post Fact Checker previously looked at a claim that Trump took credit for cutting $600 million and gave it Four Pinocchios.) Trump’s transition tweets about the F-35 program The Defense Department is in the middle of the largest aircraft procurement ever for different versions of the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter for the Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps. The F-35 is built by Lockheed Martin. Plans call for acquiring more than 2,400 aircraft over about 20 years at a cost of around $379 billion. Trump raised concerns about the F-35 program while campaigning. “I’m hearing that our existing planes are better,” he told radio show host Hugh Hewitt in October, 2015 questioning why the United States was spending “billions and billions of dollars.” He upped his criticism of the cost after he won the election. “The F-35 program and cost is out of control,” Trump tweeted Dec. 12. “Billions of dollars can and will be saved on military (and other) purchases after January 20th.” Following Trump’s tweet, Lockheed Martin’s stock plummeted, and government officials defended the program. A week later, the F-35 Joint Program Office released the final price for the contract, which showed the planes for the Air Force reduced by $5.9 million each and for the Marine Corps reduced by $2.4 million each, while the Navy model saw an increase of $3.2 million per plane. Air Force Lt. Gen Chris Bogdan told reporters that he anticipated that costs would “come down in price significantly” and put the savings “somewhere on the order of 6 to 7 percent per airplane, per variant.” The Washington Post calculated total savings between $549 million and $630 million for a lot of 90 planes. During his transition into office, Trump convened top military brass, including Lockheed Martin CEO Marillyn Hewson, at his estate at Mar-a-lago in Palm Beach on Dec. 21 to discuss how to bring costs down for the F-35 program. (Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg was also there. Boeing is the contractor for Air Force One, another project that Trump said was too expensive.) The next day, Trump tweeted: “Based on the tremendous cost and cost overruns of the Lockheed Martin F-35, I have asked Boeing to price-out a comparable F-18 Super Hornet!” A week before Trump’s inauguration, Hewson said her company was close to a deal to significantly lower costs after the Mar-a-lago meeting. Defense Secretary James Mattis ordered a review of the F-35 program in late January. On Feb. 3, the Defense Department announced it had reached an agreement with Lockheed Martin for a $728 million reduction, leading to the “lowest priced F-35s in program history.” Lockheed Martin issued a statement praising Trump’s involvement: “President Trump’s personal involvement in the F-35 program accelerated the negotiations and sharpened our focus on driving down the price.” That, however, is not the end of the story. Costs predicted to drop for years Defense and budget experts offered a big caveat to Trump’s claim: Costs had been coming down for years. Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, said that the cost reduction for the Air Force variant of the F-35 had been in the works since before Trump announced his candidacy in June 2015. “The savings are a little higher than was initially projected, but all President Trump did was elevate attention to the issue,” Ellis said. “He’s not responsible for the savings, they were already in the pipeline long before he came on the scene.” The cost per plane has always been a moving target, The Arizona Republic reported in 2014, and Lockheed Martin officials had said that costs had been coming down. The initial production model delivered in 2010 cost about $220 million, while the projection for 2020 ranged from $75 million to $85 million. The general manager of Lockheed's F-35 program, Lorraine Martin, said in 2015 that costs would drop further, “allowing us to provide our warfighters a fifth-generation F-35 jet at a fourth-generation price by the end of the decade.” The savings can be attributed to a normal learning curve, said Todd Harrison, a military budget expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “As you build more copies of an item you naturally get more efficient at the work,” he said. “That is a big part of what we are seeing here, and that would have occurred regardless of who won the presidential election.” However, Harrison said that Trump can take credit for the fact that the government was able to negotiate a deal with Lockheed so quickly for the next batch of airplanes. “For the previous lot of F-35s, DOD negotiated with Lockheed for about a year and a half and never reached a deal,” he said. “DOD ultimately used a somewhat unusual method for finalizing the contract unilaterally in late 2016.” Ben Friedman, a military budget expert at the libertarian Cato Institute, said that the savings have nothing to do with Trump, since they were already in the works. “First, there are no savings yet, as they are anticipated, perhaps hopefully,” he said. “Second, it is normal for costs to fall as production goes forward and problems are solved. Third, it's not as if no one before Trump was looking to cut F-35 costs. It has been a fixation in the Pentagon for a long time.” Our ruling Trump said, “I have already saved more than $700 million when I got involved in the negotiation on the F-35.” The Department of Defense announced a $728 million reduction on Feb. 3 for the aircraft. But Trump ignores that the government and Lockheed Martin were working toward reducing the costs for years — long before Trump’s tweets in December criticizing the price tag. We rate this claim Mostly False.

Why Space Companies Are Untouched By Trump’s Travel Ban The tech industry is stressed about losing foreign workers, but the space industry never had the choice to begin with. Because the tech sector relies so heavily on foreign talent, Silicon Valley stands to suffer from Donald Trump's executive order banning entry to the United States for nationals of seven predominantly Muslim countries. But the tech-adjacent defense and commercial spaceflight sectors have developed much differently, thanks to a regulation that all but prevents immigrants from working in those industries.   Though we often think of companies like SpaceX and Jeff Bezos's Blue Origin as "tech" companies, they operate under regulations that have been set up ostensibly to prevent foreign spies from stealing technology (like rockets) that could be used to develop weapons. The regulations are so strict that even dishwashers and line cooks in SpaceX's cafeteria and the accountants at Blue Origin must be US nationals. "If you're dealing in ITAR, the easiest path to compliance is to just hire US citizens" This complex regulatory scheme, called the International Traffic in Arms Regulations, are unpopular in the industry because it not only restricts who companies can hire but also prevents them from doing business with many foreign countries because rockets and satellites are considered "arms" under the regulations. Space companies are constantly pushing the State Department to regulate their products under the less strict Department of Commerce Export Administration Regulations. ITAR was implemented as part of a 1976 law called the Arms Export Control Act and the regulations were toughened in 1999.  It almost entirely restricts immigrants from working for US-based space and defense companies, based on the fear that immigrants could serve as spies for foreign governments wanting to learn how to create weapons. This means that the commercial space and defense contractor industries will be largely unaffected by Trump's ban, because almost everyone who works in the sector is a US citizen or green card holder. Image: SpaceX "Under the ITAR, a US Department of State Director of Defense Trade Controls export license is required prior to the release of ITAR-controlled technical data to a foreign person," Steven Brotherton, an export controls lawyer in San Francisco, told me. A "foreign person" is anyone who is not a US citizen, green card holder, or a person granted refugee status. According to immigration lawyers and people familiar with the hiring practices at several space companies in the United States, the legal hoops and bureaucracy associated with getting a waiver to ITAR employment restrictions means that essentially no immigrants work at space companies unless they are green card holders or naturalized citizens. "If you're dealing in ITAR, the easiest path to compliance is to just hire US citizens," Gregory Jaeger, a lawyer who focuses on export controls, told me. "One day I have some visitors from Japan who come over and I walk them through the office—I've just violated ITAR" That's the path most companies in the sector have taken. United Launch Alliance, a cooperative between Lockheed Martin and Boeing that makes the Atlas V rocket and regularly launches US Air Force satellites, told me that "all of our employees are US citizens or US persons." Boeing told me that it has a "very small number of employees in the US who are non-US citizens." SpaceX requires all of its employees to be ITAR compliant, and someone familiar with its workforce told me that only in extremely rare instances has it hired someone who is not a citizen or green card holder. Continuing to saddle the commercial space industry with weapons regulations has been blamed by the industry for hampering the US satellite-manufacturing business as companies in other countries have decided to work closely with European, Israeli, Chinese, or Japanese companies that don't have export restrictions. "Some of the leading satellite companies in the world are here and can't compete out on the open market because of the ITAR restrictions," Jaeger said. "And so the companies are constantly trying to move things off of the US Munitions List." Even with a dishwasher, a janitor, or a custodian at an organization like SpaceX needs to have ITAR clearance ITAR is also very easy to violate, he said. "If I am a military defense contractor, for example, imagine I've got an office where my engineers have lots of drawings and pin them to the walls," Jaeger said. "One day I have some visitors from Japan who come over and I walk them through the office—I've just violated ITAR." This restriction extends to anyone who has even a plausible possibility of coming across sensitive data, which is why most companies opt to make sure all employees are US nationals regardless of their role. "Even with a dishwasher, a janitor, or a custodian at an organization like SpaceX needs to have ITAR clearance unless they are physically blocked off from key areas of the premises where sensitive information is housed," Shirley Tang, an immigration attorney in New York, told me. "The reason they need clearance is because if they are, say, cleaning someone's desk, they could have access to a computer that might have sensitive information on the screen or they may be around when other workers are present." SpaceX, for example, has the following disclaimer in a job listing for a dishwasher: "To conform to U.S. Government space technology export regulations, applicant must be a U.S. citizen, lawful permanent resident of the U.S., protected individual as defined by 8 U.S.C. 1324b(a)(3), or eligible to obtain the required authorizations from the U.S. Department of State." More than 100 tech companies have joined the legal case against Trump's ban and an additional 150 biotechnology companies and venture capitalists strongly opposed the order in an open letter published in Nature Biotechnology. These companies heavily rely on the H-1B visa program, which allows companies to hire skilled talent from overseas. The Trump administration has threatened to overhaul this program, which is surely behind some of the sector's outrage. The space and defense sectors, meanwhile, have remained largely silent. Thus far, SpaceX has joined the tech companies' legal challenge, and Virgin Galactic CEO George Whitesides tweeted that "the best of America is open, courageous and compassionate. That's when we're strongest. The EO should be withdrawn." No other major space or defense company has come out against the executive order, and many of the ones I asked about it declined to comment. Many space companies and all defense companies operate in a different regulatory environment than most Silicon Valley companies. They rely on US government contracts, which means few of them are willing to openly criticize the federal government. Even though Trump's order will not affect the hiring practices of these companies, the new president's decisions will certainly impact their businesses: A $13 billion deal Boeing had lined up with Iran to sell the jets in the country is now in jeopardy thanks to new sanctions implemented by the Trump administration. I asked the following companies for comment on their ITAR hiring requirements and specifically asked them if they opposed Trump's executive order. Here are their responses: General Atomics (no response) Raytheon ("No comment") Orbital ATK (no response) Blue Origin ("Blue Origin has nothing to contribute at this time.") Northrop Grumman (no response) Boeing  ("We have a very small number of employees in the US who are non US citizens (and we have approximately 10,000 employees overseas from countries all over the world).  With regards to current immigration issues, we continue to monitor the ongoing administrative, legislative and judicial actions. We value the depth and diversity of our workforce, and where there was some minor disruption, we worked to address the needs of any impacted employees.") Aerojet Rocketdyne (no response) Vulcan Aerospace (no response) General Dynamics ("This isn't a subject we wish to comment on.") Sierra Nevada (no response) Bigelow Airspace (no response) Lockheed Martin ("We don't have any comment for you.") United Launch Alliance ("Because of the nature of our work for the U.S. Government, all of our employees are U.S. citizens/U.S. persons."). SpaceX (SpaceX did not want to specifically comment for this story but a spokesperson noted that the company is formally opposing Trump's order) Virgin Galactic ("Virgin Galactic is a US company and complies with ITAR and other regulatory requirements of the United States government. Within the limitations set by ITAR and other export controls, we aim to hire the most talented and diverse workforce possible. This includes hiring many fantastically talented naturalized citizens and permanent residents. These men and women are trusted colleagues and friends and contribute to the success of our business.")

By Paul Ausick February 9, 2017 7:20 am EST Print Email Tweet In an announcement released early Thursday morning, Boeing Co. (NYSE: BA) said that Singapore Airlines has committed to purchasing 20 777-9s and 19 787-10 Dreamliners in addition to the airline’s previous order for 30 787-10s. At list prices, the new commitment is valued at $13.8 billion. Singapore Airlines is the launch customer for the 787-10, the largest version of Boeing’s 787 family, and the 40 copies the airline has ordered have a list price value of $15 billion. First delivery of the 787-10 is scheduled for next year. At a list price of $306.1 million, the 787-10 is the most expensive in the Dreamliner family. In a two-class configuration, the plane carries 330 passengers on flights of up to 6,430 nautical miles (about 7,400 statute miles). When the new order is finalized, the company will add it to its order book. Boeing has taken 149 orders for the plane as of the end of December, not including the 19 planes in the latest order. Of 1,200 total orders for the three aircraft in the 787 family, Boeing’s backlog totaled 700. The slowdown in the market for dual-aisle jets has led to increased competition between Boeing and Airbus for that piece of the market. Low fuel prices combined with a large number of the big planes coming off leases have glutted the market for older planes that can be purchased for far less. The 20 777-9s included in Thursday’s announcement cost $400 million apiece and are the most expensive airplane on Boeing’s price list. In its order book the company does not distinguish among the three models in its new 777X family and reports a total of 306 orders, of which nearly half (150) came from a single customer, Emirates Airways. Boeing’s generated a total return of 11.3% in 2016 and has added another 5.2% in 2017 as of last night’s close. The stock closed down about 0.8% at $163.81 and is inactive so far in Thursday’s premarket session. The 52-week range is $102.10 to $170.00, and the consensus 12-month price target is $171.70.

HarwardImage Credit: Supplied‹› Published: 17:48 February 9, 2017 by Ed ClowesStaff Reporter   SMALL MEDIUM LARGE DUBAI: The Gulf will continue to be a key market for defence suppliers in 2017, according to several senior industry figures. This activity will be spurred by a “security environment that is as challenging as we have ever known,” with countries around the region facing “unprecedented challenges,” according to Robert S. Harward, Chief Executive of Lockheed Martin United Arab Emirates. With rising global tensions, international demand for defence and military products is increasing across the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries, according to a report released by Deloitte in January. As a result of this increasing insecurity, many countries have hiked their spending on next generation military equipment, with the UAE and Saudi Arabia leading the field in the GCC. “International sales currently represent roughly 30 per cent of Boeing Defence, Space & Security’s business, and we see continued opportunities for growth, particularly in the Middle East and the Asia Pacific regions,” said Scott Day, Boeing Defence, Space & Security Communications, in an email to Gulf News. According to Theodore Karasik, a senior adviser to Gulf State Analytics, a geo-strategic consultancy based in Washington, DC, current industry trends show an increase in multiple markets, including not only aerospace but also cybersecurity, communications and riot control equipment. That being said, Karasik also noted that “America’s ITAR restrictions (International Traffic in Arms Regulations) still hurt Washington’s sales in the MENA region, especially to the GCC.” It is unclear what president Donald Trump intends to do with the existing regulations governing the export of arms, although analysts expect him to loosen restrictions in favour of a home build approach. One of the key challenges facing defence suppliers in 2017 is the reduction in spending by governments in the region, hurt by low oil prices. “Our focus remains on delivering the most affordable advanced technology solutions to provide our partners with critical full spectrum capabilities to help solve some of the most difficult security challenges,” noted Harward. Karasik also cited budgetary constraints as one of the key issues in defence this year. “The MENA countries, particularly the GCC, are undergoing transformations of their economies and thus are seeking to procure the best possible deals,” Karasik said, adding that the UAE’s domestic industry has helped “offset suppliers from outside of the region.” Matthew Cochran, Chairman of Defence Services Marketing Council, agrees with this sentiment about home-grown defence suppliers. “Having more “Made in the UAE” type defence and security companies that have capabilities with export potential, like Tawazun Dynamics and NIMR, will provide for a suitable future for regional GCC allied militaries,” said Cochran. For Karasik, in 2017 the opportunities for suppliers lie in “areas of technological issues.” “While there is increasing specialisation by arms sellers, there are requirements for unmanned systems, cyber tools, and communications that continue to be in the MENA region’s highest interest,” he added. “Today, we are working together with the UAE to support everything from aerospace to outer space,” noted Harward. According to Deloitte’s report, several Middle Eastern countries spend a significant percentage of their GDP on defence costs, with Oman and Saudi Arabia being two of the top three. With $85.4 billion in military expenditure in 2015, Saudi Arabia was also the fourth largest defence spender globally.

Idaho Business Health Nation/World Elections Photos News NASA astronauts training in water survival at Fairchild THURSDAY, FEB. 9, 2017, 6 A.M. NASA team members Bob Behnken, Eric Boe, Doug Hurley and Sunni Williams speak to elementary school students on Wednesday, Feb. 8, 2017, at Hallett Elementary School in Medical Lake, Wash. (Tyler Tjomsland / The Spokesman-Review) By Eli Francovich elif@spokesman.com(509) 459-5417 Twitter Facebook  Email  Reddit  SMS Commercial Crew Transport Program Boeing CST-100 Starliner Launch vehicle: ULA Atlas V Height: 171 feet SpaceX Crew Dragon Launch vehicle: Falcon 9 Height: 208 feet Source: NASA Four NASA astronauts who hope to travel to the International Space Station next year aboard “private space taxis” are in water-survival training at Fairchild Air Force Base. One of the four, Col. Bob Behnken, USAF (ret.), a former test pilot, compared what the astronauts are doing now to the early days of the U.S. space program in the 1960s. America ended its 30-year space shuttle program in 2011, and since then American astronauts have used Russian Soyuz spacecraft to get to the space station. But “in recent years, observers have … expressed concerns about relying on a foreign government to send Americans to the space station, especially when political disputes occurred between Russia and the United States,” according to Space.com. The four astronauts are training to fly on the Boeing Starliner capsule and SpaceX’s Dragon capsule. Which capsule the astronauts will be assigned to is not yet known, Behnken said. NASA is contracting with SpaceX and Boeing to ferry astronauts to the space station in what’s called the “commercial crew transport program.” The first crewed test flights are planned for May 2018. “We haven’t had a day like this since the ’60s,” Behnken said Wednesday. “We haven’t built any new ships.” The four astronauts spoke to more than 500 schoolchildren Wednesday in Medical Lake. Besides Behnken, they are: Col. Eric Boe USAF (ret.); Col. Doug Hurley USMC (ret.); and Capt. Sunni Williams USN (ret.). All four are space veterans, and all were experimental test pilots prior to joining NASA. Behnken said the crew is training at Fairchild in case they crash into the ocean on re-entry into Earth’s atmosphere. Training will include deploying and boarding a life raft, among other things. “If something went wrong, you could potentially end up in the water,” he said. “So we’re here at Fairchild to get some refresher training on water survival.” The two spacecraft, designed by Boeing and SpaceX respectively, are still in the testing phases. As test pilots, the astronauts give feedback about what works, and what doesn’t work. Essentially they are designing the training manual for future space missions, Behnken said. “Particularly since we’re in the design phase, if there is something we can change to make it better, now is the chance to do it,” he said. One example of that influence is what is or is not automated in the spacecraft. “That’s one of the things I think we are going to really face going forward with these spacecraft because there is a really strong desire to automate things,” Behnken said. For certain situations, he believes it’s better if the crew is in charge, or at least has the option of taking manual control. The four spoke to the Hallett Elementary students for about an hour, fielding questions about what it’s like to be weightless, astronaut food and whether Pluto is still a planet. It’s not. Hallett Elementary School Principal Cindy McSmith said the visit shows children a potential career path and is part of the school’s effort to push secondary education. “It’s a fabulous opportunity for our kids to see some of the opportunities that lay ahead of them,” she said. And although the four astronauts are certainly the most visible ambassadors for the space program, Boe emphasized they are only one part of the effort. “There are a lot of other people making this happen,” he said.

The carrier said it had signed a letter of intent with the US manufacturer for 20 of its 777-9s and 19 of its 787-10s, with options for six more of each aircraft, bringing the total to 51 if exercised. "Today's major order for widebody aircraft enables us to continue operating a modern and fuel-efficient fleet, providing the SIA Group with additional expansion opportunities to ensure that we retain our industry-leading position," chief executive Goh Choon Phong said in a statement. "This order is also another demonstration of our commitment to further growing the Singapore hub, as we will be able to offer even more travel options for our customers." The 787-10s, powered by Rolls-Royce Trent 1000 engines, are due to be delivered in the 2020/21 financial year, while the 777-9s, fitted with General Electric's GE9X engines, are scheduled to arrive in 2021/22. SIA has a fleet of 182 planes across five brands which include the main airline, regional wing SilkAir, medium- to long-haul budget carrier Scoot and low-cost arm Tiger Airways, as well as its cargo business. Aviation analyst Shukor Yusof said the deal was SIA's attempt to move into its next stage of growth. "The new Boeing 787 aircraft are likely to be given to Scoot and Tiger Airways, which will be used for shorter journeys around the region," said Shukor of Malaysia-based aviation consultancy Endau Analytics. He said the 777-9s will complement the airline's fleet of Airbus A350s, which it uses for non-stop flights to San Francisco. SIA has been facing tough competition from Middle Eastern carriers on long-haul routes and budget airlines within the region. On Tuesday it said it booked a net profit of Sg$177 million ($125 million) in the third quarter to December, down 35.6 percent year on year, and warned 2017 would be "another challenging year". SIA pointed to "tepid global economic conditions and geopolitical concerns, alongside market headwinds such as overcapacity and aggressive pricing by competitors". It also said "loads and yields for both the passenger and cargo businesses are projected to remain under pressure". SIA shares closed at Sg$9.94 Thursday, up 1.43 percent from the previous day. The orders were announced after the market closed.

Quotes in the article Singapore Airlines Ltd SINGY ▼ 13.99 -0.01 -0.07% Boeing Co BA ▲ 166.23 +1.95 +1.19% The airline agreed to buy 20 777-9s, which are set to debut at the decade’s end, and 19 787-10s, the longest Dreamliner model, for $13.8 billion at list prices that don’t reflect customary discounts, Singapore Air said in a statement on Thursday. Boeing was nearing an order for at least 35 wide-body aircraft from Singapore Air, Bloomberg News reported Wednesday. Those aircraft would be valued at $13.8 billion based on list prices, before the discounts that are customary in the industry. The order could be unveiled this week, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the talks are private. Deliveries of the jets will start as early as in the financial year ending March 2021, the carrier said, adding it also has options to buy six more of each of the two models. The new deal would provide a critical boost to two high-profile Boeing products amid a tough market for twin-aisle jets. The Chicago-based company has been working hard to land sales of its upgraded 777X family after twice announcing it would cut output of current models. The new aircraft will replace some of Singapore Air’s aging Boeing planes such as the 777-300ER, while giving the carrier’s low-cost units rights to jets not yet on the market. “Singapore is a deeply respected long-haul carrier, both in terms of brand quality and technical proficiency,” said Richard Aboulafia, an aerospace analyst with Fairfax, Virginia-based Teal Group. “It would be a fantastic endorsement.” Shares of the airline rose 1.4 percent to S$9.94 on Thursday in Singapore trading before the announcement. Business Travelers Singapore Air has ordered 67 of the A350-900 jets, including an ultra-long range version, as it courts business travelers with non-stop service to markets such as New York and Los Angeles. The Asian carrier’s current fleet includes 10 A350s, which Airbus says consume 25 percent less fuel than Boeing’s 777 aircraft, with 57 more on order. The airline already has 30 787-10s on order, according to Boeing’s website. Singapore Air has also reviewed a proposed, longer version of the twin-engine 777 that would carry as many as 450 passengers, a load previously handled only by four-engine jumbo jets, Bloomberg News reported Wednesday. Buffeted by marquee Middle Eastern peers such as Emirates and regional budget operators, the only Asian carrier to have flown the Concorde has said it will maintain vigilance over its costs. Singapore Air, following two consecutive quarters of decline in profits, said Tuesday that 2017 will be another challenging year amid “tepid global economic conditions and geopolitical concerns.” The carrier is the launch customer for the 787-10, the first Boeing jetliner to be manufactured solely at its new North Charleston, South Carolina, campus. Deliveries are slated to begin next year. Singapore Air’s unit Scoot currently flies the carbon-composite 787-800 and 787-900 variants of the Dreamliners. --With assistance from Kyunghee Park To contact the reporters on this story: Julie Johnsson in Chicago at jjohnsson@bloomberg.net, Andrea Rothman in Toulouse at aerothman@bloomberg.net, Benjamin Katz in London at bkatz38@bloomberg.net.

Finance Search Singapore Airlines in $13.8 bn Boeing dealBy Elizabeth LAW | AFP – Thu, Feb 9, 2017 12:23 PM AEDT Singapore Airlines said Thursday it had ordered 39 Boeing passenger planes worth $13.8 billion as it seeks to expand its capacity in the face of growing competition. The carrier said it had signed a letter of intent with the US manufacturer for 20 of its 777-9s and 19 of its 787-10s, with options for six more of each aircraft, bringing the total to 51 if exercised. "Today?s major order for widebody aircraft enables us to continue operating a modern and fuel-efficient fleet, providing the SIA Group with additional expansion opportunities to ensure that we retain our industry-leading position," chief executive Goh Choon Phong said in a statement. "This order is also another demonstration of our commitment to further growing the Singapore hub, as we will be able to offer even more travel options for our customers." The 787-10s, powered by Rolls-Royce Trent 1000 engines, are due to be delivered in the 2020/21 financial year, while the 777-9s, fitted with General Electric's GE9X engines, are scheduled to arrive in 2021/22. SIA has a fleet of 182 planes across five brands which include the main airline, regional wing SilkAir, medium- to long-haul budget carrier Scoot and low-cost arm Tiger Airways, as well as its cargo business. Aviation analyst Shukor Yusof said the deal was SIA's attempt to move into its next stage of growth. "The new Boeing 787 aircraft are likely to be given to Scoot and Tiger Airways, which will be used for shorter journeys around the region," said Shukor of Malaysia-based aviation consultancy Endau Analytics. He said the 777-9s will complement the airline's fleet of Airbus A350s, which it uses for non-stop flights to San Francisco. SIA has been facing tough competition from Middle Eastern carriers on long-haul routes and budget airlines within the region. On Tuesday it said it booked a net profit of Sg$177 million ($125 million) in the third quarter to December, down 35.6 percent year on year, and warned 2017 would be "another challenging year". SIA pointed to "tepid global economic conditions and geopolitical concerns, alongside market headwinds such as overcapacity and aggressive pricing by competitors". It also said "loads and yields for both the passenger and cargo businesses are projected to remain under pressure". SIA shares closed at Sg$9.94 Thursday, up 1.43 percent from the previous day. The orders were announced after the market closed.

REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon/File Photo Enlarge Caption  Email More A A SINGAPORE/PARIS: Singapore Airlines (SIA) announced a provisional order worth US$13.8 billion at list prices to buy 39 Boeing wide-body planes on Thursday (Feb 9) as it battles Gulf carriers, dealing a blow to Airbus in the key market for big twinjets. SIA signed a letter of intent with Boeing for 20 777-9s and 19 787-10s to tap additional passenger growth and to modernise its fleet over the next decade. Additional options for the two aircraft types could take the deal to as many as 51 aircraft. The preliminary order is a boost for Boeing as it seeks to restore momentum for the newest version of its long-haul 777, which after a strong debut has not had a firm order in 20 months. It is also expected to shore up export-related US jobs at a time when domestic manufacturing employment is a sensitive political issue under US President Donald Trump. "The carrier is a demanding customer and its fleet decisions usually define market trends in the intermediate term," said Jefferies analyst Howard Rubel in a note. Airlines typically get discounts on jet orders and Rubel estimated the deal's net value to be closer to US$6.5 billion or about a tenth of the US planemaker's annual volume. "While the deal may have been highly competitive, it is business in part of the market that strengthens Boeing's positioning," he said. The agreement, however, leaves a question mark over Airbus proposals to develop a larger 400-seat version of its A350 passenger jet to compete with the 406-seat Boeing 777-9. Singapore's flagship carrier had been seen as a key potential launch customer for the proposed jet, but the European planemaker last year postponed a decision on whether to launch the new project amid pressure on demand for wide-body jets. The fact that Airbus was not yet ready to make a definitive offer to supply the new plane, relying instead on the 366-seat A350-1000, may have been a handicap in the contest for Singapore's business, an industry source said. "Our priority is to certify and assure entry to service of the A350-1000," an Airbus spokesman said, adding the two main existing models represented a "good platform" for airline needs. LAUNCH CUSTOMER SIA's significant orders and recent moves to extend some of its fuel-hedging contracts to as long as five years show it is positioning itself for the next phase of growth, said Shukor Yusof, an analyst at Malaysian aviation consultancy Endau Analytics. "What's working for them is that they have very deep pockets and they are putting some of that money to replace fleet and also looking at new destinations," Yusof said. SIA has been under pressure as demand weakens for long-haul travel amid tough competition from Middle East network carriers. SIA said this would be the airline's first order for the newest 777 variant that is currently under development. SIA is already the launch customer for the 787-10, which is also currently in development, having placed an initial order in 2013 for 30 aircraft for delivery from the 2018/19 financial year. The airline operates a varied fleet with more than 50 current-generation 777s in service, while subsidiaries SilkAir, Scoot and SIA Cargo also operate other Boeing planes. Thursday's preliminary order was SIA's biggest Boeing deal by value. It also operates other Airbus aircraft including the smaller A350-900 model and the four-engined A380, the world's largest airliner, some of which could be replaced by 777-9s. The growth of the big twinjet is driven by advances in the largest engines, sparking a parallel battle between Boeing ally General Electric and Airbus supplier Rolls-Royce. GE is the sole supplier of engines on the 777 and Rolls-Royce won the US$1.7 billion order from SIA to power the 19 Boeing Dreamliner aircraft.

The deal inked on Thursday also includes options for 12 more planes. The aircraft will be delivered after 2020, SIA said in an announcement on Thursday. The proposed order, which is valued at US$13.8 billion ($19.5 billion) based on published list prices, includes flexibility for the SIA Group to substitute the B787-10 orders for other variants of the 787 family. "Today's major order for widebody aircraft enables us to continue operating a modern and fuel-efficient fleet, providing the SIA Group with additional expansion opportunities to ensure that we retain our industry-leading position," said SIA's chief executive officer Goh Choon Phong. "We are continuing to invest for the future of the SIA Group.

SIA is a longstanding Boeing customer with more than 50 current-generation B777 aircraft in service. Subsidiaries SilkAir, Scoot and SIA Cargo are also operators of Boeing aircraft. In addition to the 30 previously-ordered B787-10s, SIA has outstanding orders with Airbus for five A380-800s and 57 A350-900s. SilkAir has outstanding orders with Boeing for 37 B737 MAX 8s, while Scoot has orders with Boeing for eight B787s. Tigerair has orders with Airbus for 39 A320neos.

Expand west to the largest aviation market. Price the cheapest seats at $10. Offer business class up front for those willing to pay. A leader among ultra low-cost airlines, Ryanair had global ambitions. The trans-Atlantic routes have long been the province of the largest full-service carriers, which fill their premium cabins with the rich and famous and famously rich. As one of Europe’s biggest airlines, any move by Ryanair into that world could have further upended fares by adding more capacity to an already crowded field. Yet O’Leary always found a reason not to pull the trigger. “I don’t believe long-haul, low fares, no-frills works,” he said in 2008. “Because there’s always going to be 10 or 15 percent of the market in long haul who will pay whatever it costs for a business-class service.” Despite periodic teases of new U.S. flights, Ryanair never moved to acquire any aircraft model beyond the Boeing 737s it flies exclusively. In 2015, Ryanair made noises again, this time causing a stir when it said board members had approved plans to move ahead with trans-Atlantic flights—a logical progression given the airline’s steady growth. That led to a reversal three days later (a delay the company blamed partly on St. Patrick’s Day observances) when directors quashed the notion with a terse statement. “In the light of recent press coverage, the board of Ryanair Holdings P.L.C. wishes to clarify that it has not considered or approved any trans-Atlantic project and does not intend to do so.” But now it’s 2017, and probably too late for different reasons. Much has changed over the Atlantic in recent years amid a sharp decline in jet fuel prices. The trans-Atlantic market now sees a surge of low-cost flying from the likes of Norwegian Air, WOW Air, WestJet Airlines Ltd., and Air Canada’s discount Rouge unit. Air Canada itself has bolstered international flying, too. Even JetBlue Airways Corp. is mulling whether to cross the ocean. For now, Ryanair has shelved its trans-Atlantic plans and is scouring growth opportunities closer to home. The Dublin-based carrier, which carries about 116 million passengers annually, has its sights set on 200 million by 2024 with almost 400 new Boeing aircraft on order. “As there is plenty of capacity and growth opportunities for Ryanair in Europe, we are solely focused on European growth currently,” Ryanair spokesman Robin Kiely said in an email. Expensive aircraft For years, O’Leary cited an inability to acquire a fuel-efficient aircraft for Atlantic routes. Ryanair was unlikely to get a price from manufacturers it would like, he explained in a 2014 interview with Bloomberg, due to the market popularity of new, more fuel-efficient aircraft like Boeing Co.’s 787. The CEO also cited the torrid growth of the three large Middle Eastern carriers, Emirates, Qatar Airways Ltd., and Etihad Airways. Emirates flies between the U.S. and Italy and plans to begin a new route from Athens to Newark, N.J. in March, two routes which have drawn fierce condemnation from U.S. carriers complaining that the Gulf carriers are state-supported. Even setting all that aside, flights to America were still a strategic stretch for Ryanair. As with Dallas-based Southwest, Ryanair’s competitive advantages stem from short flights, which allow for more daily flight segments per airplane. Crossing the Atlantic would put a significant crimp in that. The most important business stories of the day. Get Bloomberg's daily newsletter. Sign Up “They wouldn’t be able to replicate their massive short-haul cost advantage on long-haul flights,” said Seth Kaplan, a managing partner at trade journal Airline Weekly. And even with the cost benefits they enjoy over full-service carriers, low-cost airlines like Ryanair and Spirit Airlines Inc. confront a revenue disadvantage for another reason: the longer the trip, the more that frills matter. “Some customers who are willing to put up with spartan service on two-hour flights aren’t willing to put up with it on seven-hour flights,” Kaplan said. Investor demands This is one reason Allegiant Travel Co.—the world’s most profitable airline by operating margin—struggled to make money serving Hawaii from the U.S. mainland, Kaplan said. Allegiant ended the service last year. Moreover, Ryanair is now a mature player in the aviation world, with investors who rely on measured, steady growth. Two years ago, when the market got word Ryanair might have put North America on its radar, the stock price reacted quickly, and not well. Fielding a new aircraft type to fly against global behemoths would prove expensive—the virtual opposite of the business maxim of sticking to one’s knitting. It seems Ryanair has decided once and for all to finish that sweater. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

(AAPL) Stock Due for a Correction? View All Posts Let’s get this out of the way first. I was wrong on Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) stock back in early January. Well … half wrong, that is. The XOM stock rally I expected from an extended “Trump bump,” Rex Tillerson being confirmed as Secretary of State and rising oil prices never materialized. In fact, Trump’s “drill baby drill” attitude toward American crude and a glut of global oil supply all contributed to undermine the longer-term fundamentals for XOM — despite oil prices rising above $53 per barrel. But XOM stock has held above its September lows and long-term support at $80. So, while the Feb $90/$92.50 call is likely a bust (unless XOM rallies sharply in the next two weeks), the Feb $80 put sell remains a solid recommendation. That said, I remain bullish on XOM, as all of the major long-term drivers remain in effect for Exxon stock. When trading options, it’s often a matter of getting the timing right. And now could be the right time, after Exxon Mobil shares appear to have finally put in a bottom following last week’s quarterly earnings report. Sentiment toward XOM stock remains largely the same as it did heading into last week’s report, with Thomson/First Call reporting that 20 of the 26 brokerage firms following Exxon stock doling out “hold” or worse ratings. Additionally, the 12-month consensus price target rests at $88.57, representing a premium of about 6% to Friday’s close. In short, there is room for upgrades and target-price increases that should help firm up XOM’s price action. Click to Enlarge On the options front, XOM traders remain largely bullish on the stock’s prospects. Currently, the March put/call open interest ratio rests at 0.57, down sharply from the prior February put/call OI ratio of 0.70. While February call options traders were targeting $92.50 strike, March traders have readjusted their targets to the $85 strike, which is home to 7,100 contracts at last check. As for March implieds, options are pricing in a potential move of about 2.5% for XOM stock through expiration. This places the lower bound near $81.35 and the upper bound at $85.65. A breakout above $85 could signal a return to XOM’s former rally, while support remains firm near $80.

Posted 09 Feb 2017 16:26 Updated 09 Feb 2017 23:53 FILE PHOTO - Boeing's logo is seen during Japan Aerospace 2016 air show in Tokyo, Japan, October 12, 2016. REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon/File Photo Enlarge Caption  Email More A A SINGAPORE/PARIS: Singapore Airlines (SIA) announced a provisional order worth US$13.8 billion at list prices to buy 39 Boeing wide-body planes on Thursday (Feb 9) as it battles Gulf carriers, dealing a blow to Airbus in the key market for big twinjets. SIA signed a letter of intent with Boeing for 20 777-9s and 19 787-10s to tap additional passenger growth and to modernise its fleet over the next decade. Additional options for the two aircraft types could take the deal to as many as 51 aircraft. The preliminary order is a boost for Boeing as it seeks to restore momentum for the newest version of its long-haul 777, which after a strong debut has not had a firm order in 20 months. It is also expected to shore up export-related US jobs at a time when domestic manufacturing employment is a sensitive political issue under US President Donald Trump. "The carrier is a demanding customer and its fleet decisions usually define market trends in the intermediate term," said Jefferies analyst Howard Rubel in a note. Airlines typically get discounts on jet orders and Rubel estimated the deal's net value to be closer to US$6.5 billion or about a tenth of the US planemaker's annual volume. "While the deal may have been highly competitive, it is business in part of the market that strengthens Boeing's positioning," he said. The agreement, however, leaves a question mark over Airbus proposals to develop a larger 400-seat version of its A350 passenger jet to compete with the 406-seat Boeing 777-9. Singapore's flagship carrier had been seen as a key potential launch customer for the proposed jet, but the European planemaker last year postponed a decision on whether to launch the new project amid pressure on demand for wide-body jets. The fact that Airbus was not yet ready to make a definitive offer to supply the new plane, relying instead on the 366-seat A350-1000, may have been a handicap in the contest for Singapore's business, an industry source said. "Our priority is to certify and assure entry to service of the A350-1000," an Airbus spokesman said, adding the two main existing models represented a "good platform" for airline needs. LAUNCH CUSTOMER SIA's significant orders and recent moves to extend some of its fuel-hedging contracts to as long as five years show it is positioning itself for the next phase of growth, said Shukor Yusof, an analyst at Malaysian aviation consultancy Endau Analytics. "What's working for them is that they have very deep pockets and they are putting some of that money to replace fleet and also looking at new destinations," Yusof said. SIA has been under pressure as demand weakens for long-haul travel amid tough competition from Middle East network carriers. SIA said this would be the airline's first order for the newest 777 variant that is currently under development. SIA is already the launch customer for the 787-10, which is also currently in development, having placed an initial order in 2013 for 30 aircraft for delivery from the 2018/19 financial year. The airline operates a varied fleet with more than 50 current-generation 777s in service, while subsidiaries SilkAir, Scoot and SIA Cargo also operate other Boeing planes. Thursday's preliminary order was SIA's biggest Boeing deal by value. It also operates other Airbus aircraft including the smaller A350-900 model and the four-engined A380, the world's largest airliner, some of which could be replaced by 777-9s. The growth of the big twinjet is driven by advances in the largest engines, sparking a parallel battle between Boeing ally General Electric and Airbus supplier Rolls-Royce. GE is the sole supplier of engines on the 777 and Rolls-Royce won the US$1.7 billion order from SIA to power the 19 Boeing Dreamliner aircraft.

Home Industry Boeing nearing $13.8 billion order from Singapore Airlines Boeing nearing $13.8 billion order from Singapore Airlines Boeing Co. is the front-runner as Singapore Airlines Ltd. closes in on an order for at least 35 wide-body aircraft amid a battle with Chinese and Middle Eastern carriers, people familiar with the matter said. By: Bloomberg | Updated: February 9, 2017 11:55 AM Those aircraft would be valued at .8 billion based on list prices, before the discounts that are customary in the industry. (Reuters) Boeing Co. is the front-runner as Singapore Airlines Ltd. closes in on an order for at least 35 wide-body aircraft amid a battle with Chinese and Middle Eastern carriers, people familiar with the matter said. Southeast Asia’s biggest long-distance carrier is considering buying 20 of Boeing’s long-range 777-9 jets, which are set to debut at decade’s end, after studying a rival bid for Airbus Group SE’s A350 aircraft, one of the people said. The carrier also is poised to take at least 19 of the Boeing 787-10, the longest Dreamliner model, the person said. Those aircraft would be valued at $13.8 billion based on list prices, before the discounts that are customary in the industry. The order could be unveiled this week, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the talks are private. Singapore Air, under pressure to cut costs after two consecutive quarters of declining profit, has been seeking more fuel-efficient aircraft as crude oil prices show signs of a rebound. The aircraft to be purchased would replace aging Boeing models such as the 777-300ER, while giving Singapore Air or its low-cost subsidiaries rights to Boeing aircraft not yet on the market. Representatives of Singapore Air and Boeing declined to comment. “The global trend is to replace inefficient planes with efficient ones,” said K. Ajith, an analyst at UOB Kay Hian Pte in Singapore. “This move is to bring down their cost.” Non-Stop Services The marquee airline is competing against rivals like Emirates that are luring first- and business-class passengers with comforts like in-flight showers. Meanwhile, discount airlines are attracting budget-minded travelers. Singapore Air also has ordered 67 of Airbus’s A350-900 jets, including an ultra-long range version, as it courts business travelers with non-stop service to markets such as New York and Los Angeles. The new deal would provide a critical boost to two high-profile Boeing products amid a tough market for twin-aisle jets. The Chicago-based company has been working hard to land sales of its upgraded 777X family after twice announcing it would cut output of current models. You may also like to watch this Boeing shares rose 0.3 percent to $164.34 at 7:20 p.m. in New York, while shares of Singapore Air gained 0.7 percent to S$9.87 as of 9:23 a.m. in Singapore trading. The Asian carrier currently has nine A350s, which Airbus says consume 25 percent less fuel than Boeing’s 777 aircraft, and 58 more on order as of Jan. 1. Singapore Air also has reviewed a proposed, longer version of the twin-engine 777 that would carry as many as 450 passengers, a load previously handled only by four-engine jumbo jets, two of the people said. Launch Customer The carrier is the launch customer for the 787-10, the first Boeing jetliner to be manufactured solely at its new North Charleston, South Carolina, campus. Deliveries are slated to begin next year. Singapore Air’s unit Scoot flies the carbon-composite Dreamliners. Boeing is counting on the -10 to mirror the drama-free development of the 737 Max and 787-9 three years ago, products of a disciplined development process for new aircraft that was fashioned after the delay-plagued debut of the 787-8 five years ago. The new jet is the most expensive Dreamliner yet, with a list price of $306.1 million, and its market entry should coincide with increased profits for the 787. Singapore Air, which reported a 36 percent drop in net income for the quarter through December, said Tuesday that 2017 will be another challenging year amid “tepid global economic conditions and geopolitical concerns.” Please Wait while comments are loading...

Boeing was nearing an order for at least 35 wide-body aircraft from Singapore Air, Bloomberg News reported Wednesday. Those aircraft would be valued at $13.8 billion based on list prices, before the discounts that are customary in the industry. The order could be unveiled this week, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the talks are private. Deliveries of the jets will start as early as in the financial year ending March 2021, the carrier said, adding it also has options to buy six more of each of the two models. The new deal would provide a critical boost to two high-profile Boeing products amid a tough market for twin-aisle jets. The Chicago-based company has been working hard to land sales of its upgraded 777X family after twice announcing it would cut output of current models.

Singapore Air has also reviewed a proposed, longer version of the twin-engine 777 that would carry as many as 450 passengers, a load previously handled only by four-engine jumbo jets, Bloomberg News reported Wednesday. Buffeted by marquee Middle Eastern peers such as Emirates and regional budget operators, the only Asian carrier to have flown the Concorde has said it will maintain vigilance over its costs. Singapore Air, following two consecutive quarters of decline in profits, said Tuesday that 2017 will be another challenging year amid “tepid global economic conditions and geopolitical concerns.” The carrier is the launch customer for the 787-10, the first Boeing jetliner to be manufactured solely at its new North Charleston, South Carolina, campus.

Business Retail Nordstrom stock climbs despite tweet attack from Trump over Ivanka fashions Originally published February 8, 2017 at 8:17 pm Updated February 9, 2017 at 10:03 am President Trump’s Twitter attack on Seattle-based retailer Nordstrom sparked a momentary drop in its stock, but even as the brouhaha became a topic for a D.C. press conference, investors seemed to ignore Trump’s ire. Share story By Janet I. Tu Seattle Times business reporter President Trump must be sorely disappointed if he was hoping his Wednesday morning tweet blasting Nordstrom for dropping his daughter’s fashion line would drive the company’s share price down. Nordstrom’s stock rose 4 percent on a bizarre day that began with a midmorning tweet from Trump declaring, “My daughter Ivanka has been treated so unfairly by @Nordstrom. She is a great person — always pushing me to do the right thing! Terrible!” The Seattle-based retailer’s shares dipped slightly but quickly bounced back to end the day solidly in positive territory — a switch from the pattern that has sent companies across America scurrying at the mere thought of a presidential brickbat via Twitter. “It seems to me the nation as a whole is adjusting to the new political realities. The possibility of a presidential tweet is probably not as much a shock to Nordstrom now as it was to Boeing a month ago,” said Patrick Schoettmer, an instructor in Seattle University’s political-science department. “It will lose its impact over time. And that fits in with a long line of research [that says] presidents can be really persuasive but only if they use their bully pulpit infrequently.” Related story Trump vs Nordstrom: The latest bout raising ethical concerns Many other retail stocks were also up Wednesday, including Macy’s, Kohl’s and JCPenney. Previous targets of Trump’s ire had seen their share prices dip. Lockheed Martin’s stock dropped 2 percent after his tweet lambasting the high price of the company’s fighter jets, while General Motors and Toyota both saw slight dips in their shares after Trump criticism, according to The Washington Post. But Nordstrom might be different as a consumer company that has most of its stores in urban Democratic strongholds, said Abhishek Borah, who teaches marketing and international business at the University of Washington’s Foster School of Business. Borah pointed to a 2014 Time magazine article that said Nordstrom “is vastly more concentrated in Democratic districts than Republican ones.” Investors might be calculating that Nordstrom’s customer base would likely not abandon the company because of Trump’s tweet, according to Borah. By contrast, Lockheed and Boeing are vulnerable as major government defense contractors, and the big manufacturers are wary of import taxes. Nordstrom’s decision to drop the Ivanka Trump line, and the subsequent president’s tweet, blew up into a national brouhaha Wednesday. Nordstrom said last week it would stop carrying Ivanka Trump merchandise for the moment, explaining that “based on the brand’s performance we’ve decided not to buy it for this season.” Nordstrom declined to say if the decision was permanent and noted it cuts a number of brands each year. Ivanka Trump’s label fired back, saying the brand saw a “significant” sales increase last year and that Nordstrom had purchased clothes from the line for this spring. A representative for the company told Bloomberg News that the collection would be available in 1,000 stores this year, up from about 800.

Nordstrom issued a statement Wednesday reiterating its decision was based on business, not politics. “Over the past year, and particularly in the last half of 2016, sales of the brand have steadily declined to the point where it didn’t make good business sense for us to continue with the line for now,” the company said. Nordstrom added that it’s talked with the Ivanka Trump team over the past year about the sales decline, and that she was “personally informed of our decision in early January.” The matter even found its way into Wednesday’s White House press briefing. When asked about the issue, White House press secretary Sean Spicer insisted Nordstrom’s decision was political and said the president had “every right” to post that tweet.“For people to take out their concern about his actions or his executive orders on members of his family — he has every right to stand up for his family and applaud their business activities, their success,” Spicer said. Nordstrom’s co-presidents last week sent an email to their employees about President Trump’s executive order temporarily barring citizens from seven predominantly Muslim countries from entering the U.S. The message talked about the company’s founding by immigrant John W. Nordstrom and how it values diversity and inclusion. Nordstrom said Wednesday that the email was not linked to the decision to drop the Ivanka Trump line. Neiman Marcus and Belk also reportedly are dropping the Ivanka Trump line from their stores. T.J. Maxx and Marshalls are reportedly distancing themselves from the brand, with employees at the stores getting instructions to throw away the brand’s signs and mix Ivanka Trump merchandise with other brands, according to The New York Times. Trump critics are pressuring Macy’s to drop the line as well. Reaction to President Trump’s tweet Wednesday was swift, with people tweeting such messages as: “.@realDonaldTrump Donald, what have we repeatedly said about using your office to influence the family business!” and “@realDonaldTrump You absolutely cannot use your office to punish companies who don’t want to do business with your family.” Others tweeted in support of the president, saying: “@realDonaldTrump It’s extraordinarily bigoted of @Nordstrom to drop @IvankaTrump clothing line for purely political reasons. Not okay.” Like much of Trump’s unconventional approach to his still-young presidency, his tweet tirades have drawn criticism from some observers of the institution. “Most people would say what Trump is doing is unusual. And most would say it’s problematic,” said Schoettmer. Janet I. Tu: 206-464-2272 or jtu@seattletimes.com. On Twitter @janettu.

(Boeing photo) Posted By: Oriana Pawlyk February 7, 2017 The Air Force’s top general said he wasn’t surprised by the departure of teams led by Northrop Grumman Corp. and Raytheon Co. from the competition to develop a new trainer aircraft. Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. David Goldfein said the decision by the Northrop-BAE Systems Plc and Raytheon-Leonardo SpA teams to leave the T-X program came after regular dialogue with industry partners — talks that he said made the request for proposal “more robust.” The process led to a series of updates to the request and allowed the service to more clearly spell out what it’s looking for in a new trainer to replace the T-38 Talon, he said. “What we tried new this time … we went through a number of draft request for proposals, and every time we went out with a draft, we got back from [industry] as intended an idea of what they have to deliver, and what they feel is a reasonable capability,” Goldfein said Tuesday at a breakfast with defense reporters in Washington, D.C. In total, the service received more than 1,300 recommendations from the defense industry, he said. The companies’ feedback led to an extended but ultimately more inclusive dialogue about what the service needs for its new trainer, he added. “Some of them along the way said, ‘You know what, now that we have a better sense of what the customer’s looking for, and what the other competitors have, we’re going to make a business decision not to jump into this race,’ ” he said. The general said he’s pleased the program remains competitive. “Right now, what we have is two competitors that have a very good sense of what we’re looking for — I’d be concerned if we only had one competitor … but as long as we’ve got a competition, and a really informed competition … I think we’re in a pretty good place,” he said. Goldfein didn’t specify which “two competitors” he was referring to, but the reference is noteworthy and may bolster a Bloomberg Government report that the Air Force competition is favoring defense giants Lockheed and Boeing. After all, as many as four competitors may still try to bid for the program — Boeing Co.-Saab; Lockheed Martin Corp.-Korea Aerospace Industries; Sierra Nevada Corp.-Turkish Aerospace; and Stavatti Aerospace Ltd., according to the BGOV report. The Air Force wants to buy 350 new trainers to replace the aging Talon, first produced by Northrop in 1959. Trainers prep pilots for “front-line fighter and bomber aircraft such as the F-15E Strike Eagle, F-15C Eagle, F-16 Fighting Falcon, B-1B Lancer, A-10 Thunderbolt and F-22 Raptor, according to the service. The Air Force announced Dec. 30 it began accepting bids for the contract, which is expected to be awarded this year. Before dropping out of the program, Northrop was the only aerospace company going up against Boeing Co. for a new, “clean-sheet” design, though other companies are working on modified designs of existing trainers. Before leaving, Raytheon and Leonardo were offering a modified design of the T-100 jet trainer. The Waltham, Massachusetts-based company known more for its missiles and the Italian defense company butted heads over Leonardo’s inability to drop costs by nearly a third, Defense News reported. Now, Boeing, collaborating with Saab, is the only team to offer a brand-new design. Lockheed and KAI are offering modification designs to the T-50. Sierra Nevada Corp. and Turkish Aerospace Industries are also reportedly partnering on their own design for a T-X trainer, one that could be more fuel-efficient, according to Aviation Week. Goldfein also said the T-X competition holds “great promise” for future acquisition programs by including an ability to credit contractors for supplying hardware for lower-than-expected costs. He said, “There are those things that we actually value above threshold that if you were able to deliver for a better price point, we will actually give you credit for bringing that [idea] in above threshold.” Previous post Next post About the Author Oriana Pawlyk Oriana Pawlyk is a reporter at Military.com.

PARIS: Boeing Co is the front-runner for a Singapore Airlines Ltd order of at least 35 wide-body aircraft that could be valued at around US$13.8 billion at list prices, Bloomberg reported. A decision to go with Boeing would be a setback for Airbus Group, which plans to build a bigger version of its A350 although these plans have already been placed on hold amid uncertainty over demand for wide-body jets. Singapore Airlines is looking at choosing 20 of the latest model of Boeing’s 777, the 406-seat 777-9 over a stretched version of the Airbus A350, Bloomberg said, citing people familiar with the matter. It is also poised to take at least 19 of the longest Dreamliner model, the Boeing 787-10, it reported, adding that the order could be unveiled this week. Singapore Airlines said in a statement that it has discussions with aircraft manufacturers on a regular basis about its fleet requirements. “Such discussions are confidential until we have a firm deal to announce”, it said. Boeing declined to comment. Singapore Airlines has also reviewed a proposed version of the twin-engine 777 that would carry about 450 passengers, a load previously handled by four-engine jumbo jets only, Bloomberg said.

Log In Subscribe TwitterFacebook Search The Buzz All of the Reasons America's F-15 Fighter Still Dominates the Skies Kyle Mizokami February 8, 2017 TweetShareShare The USAF bought its last F-15 in 2001, but foreign sales have kept Boeing’s production line humming since. The company has twice in recent years tried to again attract the interest of the Air Force, first with the semi-stealthy Silent Eagle in 2010. In 2016, Boeing again introduced a new F-15, Eagle 2040C. Eagle 2040C is designed to carry up to sixteen AIM-120D AMRAAM radar-guided missiles, more than four times the original number. The Talon HATE datalink would allow the upgraded design to network with the F-22 Raptor. One concept of operation would have the stealthy—but relatively short on firepower—F-22 flying among enemy aircraft, passing on targeting information to a Eagle 2040C acting as a flying missile battery. For nearly three decades, the F-15 Eagle fighter was considered the undisputed king of the skies. Until the debut of its replacement, the F-22 Raptor, the F-15 was the U.S. Air Force’s frontline air superiority fighter. Even today, a modernized Eagle is still considered a formidable opponent, and manufacturer Boeing has proposed updated versions that could keep the airframe flying for the better part of a century. The F-15 traces its roots to the air war in Vietnam, and the inauspicious showing of American Air Force and Navy fighters versus their North Korean counterparts. Large, powerful American fighters, designed to tackle both air-to-air and air-to-ground missions, were performing poorly against their smaller, less powerful—but more maneuverable—North Vietnamese counterparts. The 13:1 kill ratio American fliers enjoyed in the Korean War dropped to an abysmal 1.5 to 1 kill ratio in Vietnam. Contemporary fighters, such as the F-4 Phantom, had been designed under the assumption that the air-to-air missile had rendered dogfights obsolete, and with them the need for superiority maneuverability and a gun for air combat. The U.S. Air Force decided it needed a dedicated air superiority fighter, one that combined two powerful engines, a powerful radar, a large number of missiles and a gun. Above all, it had to be maneuverable enough to win a dogfight. The Air Force issued a request for proposals for the new FX fighter in 1966, and no fewer than six companies submitted competing paper designs. No prototypes were built. The air service selected McDonnell Douglas (now a part of Boeing) in 1969, ordering 107 full-scale development planes. The F-15 was a formidable aircraft. Early versions were powered by two Pratt & Whitney F100-PW-100 afterburning turbofan engines, producing 14,500 pounds of static thrust—23,500 with afterburners. This gave the aircraft a thrust-to-weight ratio of greater than one, making it so powerful that it was the first fighter to exceed the speed of sound in vertical flight. The F-15 had so much thrust it could climb to sixty-five thousand feet in just 122 seconds. In horizontal flight, the F-15 could reach speeds of Mach 2.5, and cruise at speeds of Mach 0.9. The Eagle’s AN/APG-63 nose mounted radar was the most advanced of its day, a solid state radar with “look down/shoot down” capability and a range of up to 200 miles. This allowed the F-15 to pick out low-flying enemies on radar against the clutter generated by the ground. The radar was also the first to incorporate a programmable system processor, which allowed moderate upgrades to be done via software and not intrusive hardware updates. The Eagle was originally armed with four radar-guided AIM-7 Sparrow missiles for long-range engagements and four AIM-9 Sidewinder infrared guided missiles for short-range engagements. In the air war over Vietnam, USAF F-4C Phantoms, lacking a dedicated gun, missed several opportunities to down enemy aircraft. This was remedied in the F-15 by equipping the plane with an internal M61 Vulcan twenty-millimeter gatling gun. The F-15 was also designed with long range in mind. Carrying three six-hundred-pound fuel tanks, the F-15 had a range of three thousand miles, making it possible to fly from the continental United States to Europe without stopping or midair refueling. This would make it possible to quickly reinforce NATO air defenses in case of a crisis in Europe, and later would permit the Air Force to quickly dispatch F-15s to Saudi Arabia during Operation Desert Storm. The first F-15 prototypes flew in 1972, and serial production began in 1973. The plane rapidly began to populate both the U.S. Air Force and friendly air forces, including Israel, Japan and Saudi Arabia. The F-15’s first air-to-air kill was on June 27, when Israeli Air Force ace Moshe Melnik shot down a Syrian Air Force MiG-21 in his F-15A. Melnik would eventually down four aircraft from F-15As and F-15Cs, for a career total of eleven enemy fighters shot down.

Get Bloomberg's daily newsletter. Sign Up The carrier, which is the launch customer for the 787-10, signed a letter of intent for an additional 19 of the Dreamliner variant ahead of the jet’s public unveiling as early as next week. Singapore is also ordering 20 777-9s, which are set to debut at the decade’s end. The deal is valued at $13.8 billion at list prices that don’t reflect customary discounts, Singapore said in a statement Thursday. The order gives a boost to Boeing’s largest, most expensive and slowest-selling 787 Dreamliner. Boeing has garnered 149 total orders for the -10, which retails for $306.1 million each. Southeast Asia’s leading long-distance carrier is known as a shrewd buyer and its fleet decisions influence other airlines, said Jefferies analyst Howard Rubel. “The carrier is a demanding customer, and its fleet decisions usually define market trends in the intermediate term,” he wrote in note to investors. “It probably underscores the airline’s confidence in the company’s ability to deliver the plane’s operating efficiencies.” Important Endorsement Boeing also gains an important endorsement for its upgraded 777, the first twin-engine plane built to haul more than 400 passengers. The Chicago-based company has redoubled 777X sales efforts after twice announcing it would cut output of current models. The new aircraft will replace some of Singapore’s aging wide-bodies, including its A380 superjumbo jets from Airbus Group SE, Rubel said. Deliveries of the jets will start as early as in the financial year ending March 2021, according to Singapore. The airline also holds purchase rights that could bring the order total to 51 aircraft. The carrier has also reviewed a proposed, longer version of the twin-engine 777 that would carry as many as 450 passengers, a behemoth aimed at delivering a knock-out blow to the Airbus A380, Bloomberg News reported Wednesday. Boeing’s shares rose less than 1 percent to $164.59 at 11:40 a.m. in New York. Singapore’s stock advanced 1.4 percent to close at S$9.94 in Singapore, before the order was announced. Read More: Singapore Air extends jet fuel hedging Business Travelers Singapore has ordered 67 of Airbus’s A350-900 jets, including an ultra-long range version, as it courts business travelers with nonstop service to markets such as New York and Los Angeles. The Asian carrier’s fleet includes 10 A350s, with 57 more on order. The airline already has 30 787-10s on order. Buffeted by marquee Middle Eastern peers such as  Emirates and regional budget operators, the only Asian carrier to have flown the supersonic Concorde has said it will maintain vigilance over costs. Singapore Air, following two consecutive quarters of decline in profits, said Tuesday that 2017 will be another challenging year amid “tepid global economic conditions and geopolitical concerns.” The 787-10 is the first Boeing jetliner to be manufactured solely at a new North Charleston, South Carolina, campus. Deliveries are expected to start next year. Singapore’s unit Scoot flies the carbon-composite 787-800 and 787-900 variants of the Dreamliners. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Yet the B-52 bomber could soon get a radical overhaul, making it one of America's first military planes to have a laser weapon system. Air Force bosses are experimenting with fitting external laser pods to the giant plane, allowing it to blast incoming missiles out of the sky or jam their navigation systems.  Scroll down for video  The Boeing-manufactured bomber (pictured) has been in use since 1952 and is expected to remain operating until 2040, when it'll be replaced by the Northrop Grumman's B-21. Air Force bosses are experimenting with fitting external laser pods to the giant plane, allowing it to blast incoming missiles out of the sky or jam their navigation systems. LASER WEAPONS 'COMING SOON'  Air Force bosses have boasted combat lasers will be fitted to fighters planes 'very soon' and have revealed a full scale prototype is being built. 'I believe we'll have a directed energy pod we can put on a fighter plane very soon,' Air Force General Hawk Carlisle claimed at the Air Force Association Air & Space conference last year in a presentation on what he called Fifth-Generation Warfare, according to Ars Technica. 'That day is a lot closer than I think a lot of people think it is.'    The project is part of the Air Force Research Lab's five-year plan to create power, optics and lasers to help defend large bombers such as the B-52. Air Force Chief Scientist Greg Zacharias told Scout Warrior: 'You can take out the target if you put the laser on the attacking weapon for a long enough period of time.'  The researchers say the older, larger plane cold be perfect for laser weapons, and attaching an external pod would not affect its capabilities.  Zacharias said the laser system would not be expected to work on stealthy aircraft such as F-15's or F-35's.  Lasers use extreme heat and light to burn targets without creating a large explosion. They work at very high speeds so they have an almost instant ability to destroy rapid targets and defend against enemies.  Zacharias also said that if for some reason a pilot doesn't want to destroy an incoming missile but throw it off course, lasers could jam them.  RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next US Army reveals smart sight that could give EVERY soldier...

The Air Force Research Laboratory has said that they aim to have a plan in place for a laser weapon program by 2023 Ground level testing for a weapon called the High Energy Laser has been taking place for the last few years at White Sand Missile Range in New Mexico, with the first airborne tests set to take place by 2021.  Air Force leaders told Scout Warrior that they plan to also integrate the lasers in large platforms such as C-17s and C-130s, and eventually on smaller jets such as the F-15.  But these laser weapons may not stick solely to aircraft platforms.  The US Navy has plans to incorporate these lasers on US naval ships to help defend ships from drones and missiles.  The lasers could also play a crucial role in defending against ballistic missiles. According to Air Force experts, one of the clearest advantages of this laser technology is that instead of carrying a limited number of missiles on an aircraft, an energy based weapon such as a laser could fire thousand of shots using one gallon of jet fuel.  BOEING B-52 FACTS AND FIGURES  First flight: 1952 Length: 159 feet, 4 inches Wingspan: 185 feet Speed: 650 mph Range: 8,800 miles without refueling Armaments: 31,500 kilograms of ordnance, which can include bombs, mines and missiles Crew: Five Inventory: 58 active, 18 reserve Cost: US$84 million Source: US Air Force  Read more: Air Force Laser Weapons to Defend B-52 Bomber - Warrior - Scout Share or comment on this article e-mail 32 shares Most watched News videos Danielle Bregoli throws punches while boarding Spirit Airways Cameraman 'zooms in' on woman's breasts in 'see-through' swimsuit Caught on camera: Bystanders watch topless men fighting in street Moment Lindsay Hoyle and Alex Salmond scream at each other Danielle Bregoli discusses fighting a 'crack head' with her mom 'I don't take no s***': Bus driver kicks drunk man off bus Watch Barack Obama wipe out in kite surfing battle McConnell blocks Warren from reading letter from MLK's wife Footage shows hostile environment that Alexander Blackman endured Melissa McCarthy nails screeching Sean Spicer on SNL Danielle went viral after appearing on Dr Phil in 2016 Moment woman pops open her shirt by flexing her boobs Socialite Tara Palmer-Tomkinson, 45, dies at her London...

Business Nation & World Politics Technology AT&T tries to connect in capital where Trump has changed the game Originally published February 10, 2017 at 1:30 pm Updated February 10, 2017 at 3:36 pm AT&T has morphed from a telephone company to a media powerhouse with $164 billion in revenue and a plan to grow bigger by buying Time Warner. But Donald Trump has sharply criticized the deal, not to mention Time Warner cable channel CNN, leaving the merger’s future in doubt. Share story By Todd Shields Bloomberg News AT&T would normally expect good things when a Republican administration arrives in Washington, D.C., where the company needs permission to buy Time Warner — except the new president has already lambasted the deal. So the search goes on for friends in high places. At an evening reception near the U.S. Capitol, AT&T bathed lobbyists, lawyers, executives and lawmakers in cool blue light. To pulsing music in new studio space, partygoers sipped drinks, nibbled avocado tartare with melon carpaccio, and posed with a blonde in a slinky white gown who was promoting “Ice,” a drama available on AT&T’s DirecTV. The event, which AT&T called a “Stars & Stripes Reception,” showcased the company’s transformation from a telephone company to a media powerhouse with $164 billion in revenue. The descendant of the stodgy Ma Bell monopoly wants to accelerate its metamorphosis with one of its biggest deals ever, an $85.4 billion acquisition of Time Warner, owner of HBO, CNN and the “Harry Potter” movies.

Just one problem: As a candidate, President Trump cited the deal as “an example of the power structure I’m fighting.” Since taking office, he’s said to have privately told people he still opposes it. Publicly he excoriates CNN for its coverage of him, and brags that he never watches. Trump will appoint officials who will vet the deal at the Justice Department. Still, AT&T presses ahead. It has mobilized its army of roughly 100 lobbyists, one of the biggest and savviest corps in D.C. where it has spent more than $213 million making its case since 1998, according to data compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics, a D.C.-based group that tracks money in politics. The company spent $16.4 million lobbying in 2016, second only to Boeing among U.S. companies, according to the center. Time Warner spent $2.9 million on lobbying over the same period. Then there is the avocado tartare. “All of this outreach, all of this cultivation, is ensuring you have allies,” said Meredith McGehee, strategic adviser to the Campaign Legal Center, explaining how lobbying powerhouses like AT&T get their way in D.C. “You get to know people. You invite them. You do the receptions.” Six days before the party, Chief Executive Officer Randall Stephenson and AT&T’s top D.C. executive, Bob Quinn, participated in one of the most coveted receptions of all. They dropped in on Trump at his New York tower. But the deal didn’t come up, the company insists. Instead they steered the conversation to something they knew their host wanted to hear about: the jobs the company provides. The theme was the same on Inauguration Day. “We employ more than 250,000 people,” the company said in a full-page ad in The Washington Post on Jan. 20. “As we testified recently before Congress, the merger will create more competition for cable TV providers, giving consumers more options and accelerating next generation wireless broadband,” said Michael Balmoris, a spokesman for the Dallas-based AT&T. Mobile HBO The soft-shoe approach comes with high stakes. Acquiring Time Warner’s content would allow AT&T to move away from dependence on slow wireless subscriber growth. It would allow it to ride a surge in demand Stephenson is sure is coming for mobile video. So far Wall Street isn’t sure he’ll succeed: Traders still are paying less for Time Warner shares than AT&T promises, even though the price has risen since the deal was announced Oct. 22. Stephenson, the CEO, said he’s confident the deal will go through because it joins companies in different businesses and leaves market shares the same in telecommunications. AT&T isn’t just ingratiating itself with the president whose appointees will decide if the deal lives or dies. It is building goodwill among lawmakers on Capitol Hill, constructing an insurance policy that may help prove Wall Street’s bears wrong. “You start to cultivate champions on the Hill, so if an antitrust action comes about you can turn to those champions and say, ‘Hey I need you to push back. I need you to write letters,’” said McGehee, of the Campaign Legal Center. Republican tilt The company’s organized giving has tilted toward Republicans, the traditional party of business interests. In the recent U.S. elections, Republican candidates got 62 percent of $2.7 million in donations to federal candidates from AT&T’s political-action committee that pools contributions from employees, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. In the company’s lobbyist corps, Republicans outnumber Democrats roughly two-to-one among those whose partisan background could be determined, according to a Bloomberg analysis of Senate records. Firepower hasn’t always brought success for AT&T under Democratic regulation from 2009 to this January. Officials forced AT&T to abandon a $39 billion bid for smaller T-Mobile US in 2011. The FCC in 2015 proposed a $100 million fine over data speeds for wireless customers, another agency levied a $105 million penalty for faulty billing, and AT&T couldn’t stave off limits on how it uses subscribers’ data. AT&T won permission to buy satellite TV company DirecTV in 2015 after promising broadband to more homes and businesses. ‘Drain the swamp’ Even with a change to Republicans, it’s not clear all the lobbying and contributions will help with the unconventional administration of Trump, who won the White House with a populist message and a promise his personal wealth would mean he wouldn’t be beholden to lobbyists and special interests. Trump as a candidate said his administration would block the Time Warner deal because it made for “too much concentration of power in the hands of too few.” The deal review is to be performed by antitrust regulators at the Justice Department, who concentrate on competition. Telecommunications deals traditionally face a parallel review by the Federal Communications Commission, which can be tougher. But AT&T and Time Warner have said they can avoid that by not transferring any of the airwaves licenses that the FCC oversees. Time Warner Chief Executive Officer Jeffrey Bewkes on Wednesday told investors the company is “confident the deal will be approved later this year.” Share programming? It’s possible Justice Department antitrust officials will find the combined company has significant market power to favor its own products, said Gene Kimmelman, a former antitrust official in a Democratic Justice Department. One way to resolve that is to require behavioral remedies — such as a requirement to share programming with rivals. “But the real question is, does the Justice Department even want to apply those conditions?” Kimmelman said. If not, regulators would have a choice to approve a deal they see as harmful, or simply ask a judge to block it. AT&T’s Stephenson has said the company would fight the Justice Department in court if necessary. “You may find an environment in which it’s an up-or-down, all-or-nothing, antitrust review,” Kimmelman said. That’s where a relationship with Trump can pay off. U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions has said he’ll keep politics out of merger reviews. The administration hasn’t announced its choice for assistant attorney general for antitrust, a post that also needs Senate confirmation. The Trump team is said to be considering Joshua Wright, a law professor who promotes a laissez-faire approach to antitrust enforcement. “It comes down to the antitrust analysis,” said Matthew Cantor, a partner at Constantine Cannon LLP in New York. “If one was to judge this deal on the merits, I think it gets through.” Todd Shields Email Newsletter Sign-up Custom-curated news highlights, delivered weekday mornings.

BENGALURU: A host of foreign companies will be wooing Indian government agencies and firms at Aero India 2017, keen to get a large piece of the marketshare in the blooming defence and aerospace sectors. From electronic warfare systems for Light Combat Aircraft (LCA) Tejas to sub-systems for the weaponised Advanced Light Helicopter, from air ambulance to precision weapon systems, companies from across the globe have booked slots in the 11th edition of Aero India. The participation of a large international contingent indicates that the hopes of the organisers to see a marked increase in business this edition compared to the previous ones, are not unfounded. Dassault, Boeing, Airbus, Saab, Lockheed Martin and Thales are among some of the international companies that will be seen at what is being touted as Asia's premier air show. United Kingdom's BAE Systems, which was recently awarded a contract by the US Department of Defence to provide 145 ultra-lightweight howitzers to the Indian Army through a foreign military sale between the Indian and US governments, said that it foresaw many other opportunities in India. BAE will bring its Eurofighter Typhoon and its Advanced Precision Kill Weapon System (APKWS) among other systems to Aero India 2017. India director of BAE Systems Alistair Castle said, "The Make-in-India initiative is the cornerstone of our strategy, and Aero India is an excellent platform for us to engage all our customers, and explore new partnerships, in addition to strengthening our ties with firms such as HAL and Mahindra." Dassault's Falcon 8X, which was recently certified, will debut at Aero India, while Swedish firm Saab, which has expressed interest in multiple projects including two aircraft procurement programmes, is bringing in as many as 11 products. Thales, another French firm, will offer its expertise to help expand the India's industrial defence base. "Our association with India dates back to 1953. Besides giving a boost to the Make-in-India initiative, we will also look to export from India. Events like Aero India help us further our objectives by giving us a platform to engage with all the key stakeholders, and allowing us to bring cutting-edge solutions to the Indian market," said Pascale Sourisse, Thales' senior executive vice-president for international development. Rocket systems, sonars, surveillance and fire control radars are among the technologies that Thales will showcase in Bengaluru. Airbus, which has several tie-ups with Indian firms, besides having a large presence in the country's commercial aviation sector, will have its dedicated helicopter ambulance on static display at the event. Airbus India president and managing director Pierre de Bausset said that the firm's business in India results in procurement worth $500 million (approximately Rs 3,400 crore) annually from India. The firm also provides employment to 6,000 people in the country. Stay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device.

(AP Photo/Pablo Martinez Monsivais) Share Written by Tim Fernholz Obsession "America First" February 10, 2017 As Donald Trump lunches with Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe, reportedly to talk about the future of global trade, it’s worth assessing whether or not the new US president will really attempt to renegotiate an important trade pact closer to home: the North America Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) between the US, Canada, and Mexico. NAFTA, since it already governs a significant share of economic activity, matters much more than Trump’s decision to officially pull out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a not-yet-sealed deal that looked unlikely to come into force regardless of who won the US election. But shaking up NAFTA would have real effects on existing business—which is why Trump will likely prefer cosmetic changes to it over doing anything meaningful. Trump has talked tough, against Mexico specifically, about renegotiating NAFTA. But there’s plenty of reason to believe that Trump will bow to special-interest concerns supporting the pact as is. After all, when his populist priorities meet a corporation’s bottom line, the company has a tendency to win out. Exhibit A: The change of heart on subsidizing exporters Most recently, there is the example of the Export-Import Bank, a US agency that subsidizes American companies that sell abroad, largely Boeing and General Electric. Libertarians hate the bank, saying it is just corporate welfare, and were convinced that the populist president would oppose its activities. “[Trump] essentially said that he was against it,” Andy Koenig, who lobbies against the bank on behalf of a Koch Industries-funded nonprofit, told the Washington Times in December. Koenig was hopeful that Trump, once in office, would shut down the bank. But Trump has apparently found a new position. A group of lawmakers who met with the president on Feb. 9 say he’s embracing the plan to use government money to back American exporters. “Ex-Im Bank was big news, he wants to get that done,” senator Joe Manchin, a West Virginia Democrat, told Politico after the meeting. “He said, ‘I’ve changed my mind completely on that. I’ve seen how it functions and what it can do and we can’t compete if we don’t have a functioning Ex-Im Bank.’ Before, he thought it was different. So he’s changed and he’s 100 percent. He said, ‘You can tell everyone I said that.'” Hmm. Exhibit B: The about-face on Medicare Then consider Trump’s bluster on drug prices. Advocates for health care access have often called on Medicare, the US public health insurer, to use its market clout more aggressively to secure price cuts on medicine. On the campaign trail, Trump promised his deal-making presidency would adopt this policy to save $300 billion. “We don’t do it. Why? Because of the drug companies,” he said. But after meeting with pharmaceutical industry lobbyists at the White House during the second week of his presidency, Trump emerged to tell reporters that “I’ll oppose anything that makes it harder for smaller, younger companies to take the risk of bringing their product to a vibrantly competitive market. That includes price-fixing by the biggest dog in the market, Medicare, which is what’s happening.” At that point, the writing already had been on the wall: Trump had tapped Congressman Tom Price, a foe of using Medicare’s market power to lower prices, to run the US Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees the Medicare program. Exhibit C: Jamie Dimon’s expert advice In one of Trump’s most infamous campaign speeches, he attacked his Democratic opponent’s connection to the financial sector. “Hillary Clinton meets in secret with international banks to plot the destruction of US sovereignty in order to enrich these global financial powers, her special interest friends, and her donors,” Trump claimed. After he won the election, Trump met with a group of bankers, including Jamie Dimon, the CEO of international megabank JPMorgan Chase, and discussed the future of Dodd-Frank, the package of laws enacted in 2010 to prevent a future financial crisis. “We have some of the bankers here,” Trump told reporters afterward. “There’s nobody better to tell me about Dodd-Frank than Jamie, so you’re going to tell me about it. We expect to be cutting a lot out of Dodd Frank, because frankly I have so many people, friends of mine, that have nice businesses and they can’t borrow money…they just can’t get any money because the banks just won’t let them borrow because of the rules and regulations in Dodd-Frank.” When Trump is on the campaign trail, there’s a conspiracy of international banks undermining the US. In the White House, he’s found these same bankers offer the best advice on how to tailor the laws so his friends’ businesses can get loans. The same day, Trump signed an executive order directing his Treasury secretary overhaul Dodd-Frank, with his economic advisor Gary Cohn, formerly president of Goldman Sachs, saying banks had too much capital and followed too many rules. So, when it comes to NAFTA, will Trump force America’s multinational companies to undergo costly rebuilds of their supply chains? Or will he meet with their lobbyists and CEOs and soon be singing a different tune? One clue: The White House still hasn’t notified Congress that Trump is planning to renegotiate, which would start a 90-day countdown for a new deal to receive express consideration by lawmakers. That means his promise to overhaul NAFTA in the first 100 days is as good as broken.

Boeing, Lockheed Martin, and Raytheon (teamed with Kongsberg) are all expected to bid on the OTH-WS requirement, which will provide USN Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) variants and Future Frigate (FF) vessels with a responsive stand-off surface-to-surface capability to counter potential surface threats. Intended to increase the lethality and enhance the survivability of LCS/FF ships, the OTH-WS acquisition - being managed by the Program Executive Office Integrated Warfare Systems 3.0 (PEO IWS 3.0) in NAVSEA - is firmly aligned to the surface navy's new operating concept of 'distributed lethality'.

Required fields are marked * Name * Email * Website  −  1  =  zero Comment Some HTML is OK Sign me up for the Money Morning newsletter When President Donald Trump tweets negatively about a company, the company's stock price can quickly drop. Boeing Co. (NYSE: BA) shareholders know this all too well, as the BA stock price dropped by 1.5% after President Trump tweeted on Dec. 6, 2016, that the company's costs were out of control. And these volatile price swings are why it's so important for investors to own Trump-proof stocks in 2017. Money Morning Director of Tech and Venture Capital Research Michael A. Robinson expects this to be a continuing trend throughout the Trump presidency. "The truth is, it's likely we can look forward to this kind of 'volatility' from here on out," Robinson said on Dec. 15. But Robinson has one stock that provides high-growth, low-stress protection from President Trump's tweets. And there's a lot to like about this stock: Over the last 12 months, this stock has climbed 43%. In comparison, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up just 23.73%. This company pays its shareholders a dividend of $0.62 per share, which is a yield of 1.56%. The stock price has a one-year price target of $181.86, which is a potential profit of over 13% from where it's trading today. This stock has an average rating of "Buy," according to FactSet. "I can't imagine any mere 140 characters are going to ding it," Robinson said. But he also said it's only a matter of time before Wall Street and everyone else starts to notice this stock. Fortunately for Money Morning readers, you'll be getting ahead of the crowd on owning this top Trump-proof stock. Here's everything you need to know about the stock Robinson said will provide "stress-free upside potential." Own One of the Top Trump-Proof Stocks Now Join the conversation.

Offbeat2 Courts & Crime Education Life & Style News Pictures Sport 1 Business Sport Opinion Leisure Life&Style Culture Guides Multimedia Your Say In Focus Supersonic passenger jets set for a comeback A handful of firms working to develop economically viable jets Published: 19:22 February 10, 2017 By Samantha Masunaga   SMALL MEDIUM LARGE Los Angeles: Supersonic passenger jets might make a comeback, more than a decade after the last Concorde flight. The beak-nosed, supersonic Concorde was once described by a British ambassador as the “flower of the aerospace industry.” But while the sleek plane could cut travel times in half, it was ultimately doomed by a combination of high maintenance expenses, a slower market for air travel after the September 11 attacks and high ticket prices. A round-trip flight from London to New York could cost as much as $18,260 in today’s dollars. Now, almost 14 years after the Concorde’s last flight, a handful of companies and entrepreneurs are betting that technological advances in materials and computing, as well as the boom in global business travel, could power a resurgence in economically viable supersonic passenger jets. “We’re benefiting from 50 years of progress in fundamental aerospace technology,” said Blake Scholl, chief executive of Boom Technology Inc., a Centennial, Colorado. start-up that’s aiming to build a supersonic airliner called the Boom. “Since the Concorde was developed, the amount of international business and international travel has skyrocketed. You can find a huge market.” New supersonic planes, if they get off the ground, will still be comparatively pricey. Analysts predict the technology would be best suited, at least initially, to business jets. That’s the market companies like Aerion Corp. are aiming for. The Reno, Nevada, firm, along with European aviation giant Airbus Group, has been developing the AS2, a supersonic business jet that could shoot through the air at a maximum speed of Mach 1.5, or one and a half times the speed of sound. A flight from Los Angeles to Tokyo would take about five hours, compared with almost 12 hours today. “I think its main customers would be very wealthy individuals who would look at it as the ultimate prestige aircraft,” said Ray Jaworowski, senior aerospace analyst at market research firm Forecast International, discussing supersonic jets in general. “It very much would have its own specific niche.” But breaking into the business market would require clearing other hurdles. For one, business jet operators are less concerned with speed than they are with range, cabin size and operating costs, Jaworowski said. The Boom is aiming at the larger airline market. Scholl says his company aims to build a 45-seat aircraft and says the cost to fly supersonic could eventually be the same as a business class seat on a conventional airliner. The company, which has just more than 20 employees, has received help with manufacturing and flight testing from Virgin Galactic’s Spaceship Co. Scholl has staked his claim on several advances, including a primary aircraft structure built with carbon fibre composites — like those in the Boeing 787 Dreamliner’s frame — which should be stronger and lighter than the aluminium exterior of the Concorde. The engines for the supersonic planes, though, won’t be all that different from those of conventional airliners. The Boom will have “medium-sized” turbo fan jet engines that have been adapted from a current commercial aircraft and will be modified by “major” engine companies that Scholl would not yet disclose. This decision, contrasting with the Concorde’s famous afterburners, will make the Boom quieter and more fuel efficient, he said. “The reason why (Concorde) prices were so high is fuel economy was poor, and there was no economy of scale,” Scholl said. “We have the technology for that today.” Scholl said he chose a modified commercial engine rather than a military-grade supersonic propulsion system because of the high emissions standards and efficiency offered by the conventional engines. And from a logistics standpoint, it would be more difficult for military-grade technology to clear export control, he said. Advances in computing power and speed are also key to developing more efficient supersonic jets. Engineers can now test prototypes through computer models and make tweaks immediately based on those results. Previously, they had to build a plane, test it in a wind tunnel and then tweak the design. “We’re now able to bottle physical features in a computer that a short decade ago were unheard of,” said Jim Ladesic, associate dean of industry relations and outreach at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University’s college of engineering in Florida. The idea of building faster, economic passenger planes has intrigued aerospace companies for years. In 2001, Boeing unveiled a concept called the Sonic Cruiser, which was to fly almost as fast as the speed of sound, 750 miles per hour. The company said at the time it was working with airlines to determine economic, performance and environmental needs for the concept. But oil prices were rising, and those plans were shelved just a year later as airlines ended up prioritising fuel efficiency over speed. Research on the plane’s interior was later incorporated into Boeing’s more efficient 787. Both Boeing and Airbus have since expressed interest in developing high-speed aircraft. Boeing Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg has noted several times that the Chicago-based company wants to advance research of hypersonic — Mach 5 or faster — technology. Boom is currently building a one-third scale model test aircraft that it says will fly for the first time by the end of this year. The actual production aircraft, which will be 60 feet long and weigh 150,000 pounds, could fly its first passengers as early as 2020, Scholl said. The company has 25 aircraft orders to date. The first 10 will go to British billionaire Richard Branson’s Virgin Group, and the other 15 are on hold for a European carrier that Scholl declined to name. One obstacle that may be out of plane makers’ control is the Federal Aviation Administration’s long-standing ban on supersonic flight by commercial aircraft over land, due to noise concerns about sonic booms. Boom is planning to fly only transoceanic routes to avoid the issue. But a group of industry leaders as well as Nasa and universities have helped devise new technologies over the years that could mitigate sonic booms. One of these efforts is Nasa’s Quiet Supersonic Technology X-plane project. Last year, Lockheed Martin Aeronautics Co. in Palmdale, California, won a contract to complete the aircraft’s preliminary design. — Los Angeles Times   Last Concorde finds its final resting place The last Concorde to take to the skies made its first journey in more than 10 years last week — when it was towed into a new hangar at a leisurely pace on a British runway. Concorde 216 has been parked on a runway in Filton, Bristol, since its farewell flight over the city in 2003. But after 13 years languishing at the side of an airfield in Bristol, the iconic supersonic plane was towed across the airfield to an indoor hangar in preparation for it becoming the centrepiece of a new aerospace museum. The Bristol Aviation Centre, which will celebrate the city’s aviation history, is due to open this summer. A small crowd gathered to watch the jet make its latest journey — although the sound barrier remained unbroken during its 800 metre trip. It took about 20 minutes to complete the move to its new home, according to the BBC. The plane made her maiden flight on April 20, 1979 and touched down on her last flight to Filton on November 26, 2003. The new museum — built around a listed First World War hangar — will also document the city’s central role in the development of the modern aviation industry.

Privacy RSS Steam Twitter Facebook Login RPS Feature Infinite Horace II, the first five missions Home Featured Articles The Flare Path: Sings The Unsung By Tim Stone on February 10th, 2017 at 1:00 pm. Share this: Facebook Twitter Reddit Once I’ve typed up this sortie summary, Infinite Horace II, my latest B-17: Queen of the Skies hope chalice, will be setting off on his sixth combat mission. Unlike the original Infinite Horace, a B-17 Flying Fortress based in England and crewed by RPS writers, Infinite Horace II is a B-24 Liberator based in Southern Italy and crewed – with one exception – by foolhardy fearless Flare Path readers. The steed change was partially motivated by curiosity (I was keen to try Preston McMurray’s rigorously researched B-24 rules variant) and partially by a desire to sing the unsung. Despite being more numerous than their Boeing-designed brothers-in-arms and in many ways (range, ceiling, speed, bomb load…) more capable, Flying Boxcars have always played second fiddle to Flying Fortresses in the popular imagination. Key differences between the two types are reflected in a clutch of carefully thought-out B17QotS rule changes. The Liberator’s retracting rolltop desk-style bomb bay doors bestow benefits during bombing runs but make ditching and wheels-up landings more perilous. Weaker wings and higher stick forces mean wing root hits are more dangerous and autopilot damage is potentially more serious. The USAAF’s tendency to overburden the bomber translates into dicier take-offs. Thanks to our higher cruise speed, Shiloh, our tail-end Charlie, has an increased chance of hitting tailgaters, and because of our exceptional range, fuel leaks are slightly less worrying. The ten souls cocooned within B-24J Infinite Horace II as he droned towards the oil refineries of Fiume (Rijeka) on his maiden op were… JFS – nose turret gunner Eightball – bombardier phuzz – navigator Yours Truly – pilot JB – co-pilot bsplines – engineer unacom – radio operator/waist gunner* Lord Byte – ball gunner Rorschach617 – waist gunner Shiloh – tail gunner (Gothnak, Leafy Twigs, and Rituro are on stand-by) *Though the B-24J had two waist gun positions, only one of these was manned full-time. In the event of an attack the radio operator was expected to hurry aft and occupy the vacant position. It was a four-zone mission and trouble arrived early in the form of a determined Fw 190 attack in zone 2. Three bandits managed to slip through both our fighter picket and the fiery ticker tape parade organised by Horace’s Browning brandishers. Fortunately, apart from a nibbled port rudder and a fuel tank hit that instantly self-sealed, the Focke-Wulfs only managed to cause superficial damage. The escorts performed better when another schwarm of Fw 190s tried their luck in zone 3, but they couldn’t stop a climbing Me 109 from drilling Horace’s belly as we neared the target. Though the Axis ascender only scored one significant hit, that hit was to our bomb bay door mechanism. When Eightball attempted to open the doors at the start of the bomb run, he found they wouldn’t budge. I think it would be fair to describe the journey back to Foggia as ‘tense’. Harassed by Me 109s over the Adriatic (Shiloh came very close to opening his account. Ball gunner Lord Byte escaped death by inches when his turret was trashed) the collective sigh of relief that was let out when Infinite Horace II, still heavy with HE, touched down safely at Cerignola could have been heard in Rome. Compared to the Rijeka run, Mission 2 was a cakewalk. We watched several blazing Liberators dash themselves against the Apennines during the five-zone trip to Verona, but nestled in the middle of the formation, had a quiet time ourselves. Part of the high group, even the flak batteries ringing the cratered marshalling yard that was our target posed little danger. In the circumstances, the fact that only 20% of our payload fell where it was meant to fall, was more than a little disappointing. The bright spot of the mission occurred as we turned for home. A Zerstörer approaching from 10.30 low, danced through the twining tracer streams of JFS, Lord Byte, and Rorschach617, missed us with its own emissions, then fell to Shiloh’s Ma Deuces moments after streaking past Horace’s tail. We’d only been back a few minutes when Technical Sergeant Someoldguy set up his stepladder and began painting a small black Me 110 outline on the side of the cockpit. The Infinite Horace II story almost ended a couple of minutes into Mission 3. A post-modifier ‘1’ on table G8 sent heavily-laden Horace careering off the end of the runway at Cerignola, the lucky – bearing in mind all that fuel and HE aboard – survivor of a potentially catastrophic take-off accident. Unexpected loss of engine power? Elevator malfunction? Forgotten four-leaf clover? Flight deck wasp? The tables refused to say. Repairs were completed in time for us to join the air armada heading Rome-ward on May 3. In theory a relatively easy two-zone outing, the sky above The Eternal City was alive with Augsburg eagles by the time we turned up. Four Me 109s decided to have a shy at Horace and one attacking from 6 high had the satisfaction of seeing his shells strike aluminium. Controls cables in the tail were chafed and radio operator unacom arrived in the waist to find it pierced by unfamiliar shafts of sunlight. The excitement passed as quickly as it had come and an uneventful return leg gave Eightball and me plenty of time to reflect on another mediocre bombing display (Only 40% of our bombs were on target). Mission 5. Belgrade. Infinite Horace II is eastbound midway between Mostar and the Yugoslavian capital. His fuselage is bullet-gouged in numerous places but his crew are quietly jubilant. The reason for the high morale and the majority of the holes is the pair of crooked smoke pillars behind us. The pillars mark the terminal trajectories of two Fw 190s that underestimated the prowess of nose gunner JFS and ball gunner Lord Byte. I let the mood percolate for a few minutes before announcing over the intercom that we will be descending to 10,000 feet in order to prevent Rorschach617 from losing his extremities to frostbite (the waist heater was shot out during the attack). Everyone knows what the altitude change means. We’ll be in the flak zone come Belgrade. Cantering Mustangs do their best to keep the bandits away on the approach to the target. I’m dimly aware of discouraged Me 109s and thickening flak as we line up for the run. For a horrible moment the insanity of what we’re doing tunnels my vision and stops my breath then something, training perhaps or a sense of responsibility, kicks in and I recover. Press on. Follow Eightball’s instructions. It can’t be long now. The next few minutes are a blur. Did the flak burst hit us a split-second before Eightball released our earth shakers or a split-second after? When the unburdened Horace began rising like an elevator was Engine 3 already riddled with shrapnel and screaming? I can see JB shutting down the runaway and feathering the prop while engineer bsplines calmly assists. I can hear myself asking every member of the crew in turn for injury and damage reports. I can remember listening to the string of ‘OKs’ with mingled relief and disbelief (Shiloh doesn’t admit to his lacerated shoulder until we are halfway home). Apart from that trashed engine all of Horace’s injuries are relatively minor. Flying slivers of steel have bodkinned the nacelles of Engines 2 and 4 here and there, but bsplines can see no signs of deeper issues. Shiloh traces a new tail turret draft to a small jagged hole in the tailplane root, and Rorschach doesn’t like the look of one of the control cable conduits in the waist, but, fingers-crossed, none of these flesh wounds will prevent us getting home. Concerned P-51s watch over us as we flee Serbia. They drive off a series of bandits drawn like vultures to the straggling, slowed Horace. In zone 4 one of the predators, an Me 110, sees an opportunity and commences a curving, climbing head-on attack. Our nose guns begin to chatter as I initiate a turn (Thank goodness Horace is a B-24J rather than one of the earlier front turret-less Liberator variants). Lord Byte’s ball turret Brownings join the chorus. Tadpoles of red fire rush past the windscreen. That evening in the mess, using an empty beer bottle to represent our ship and a smouldering Diamond Joe cigar to represent the doomed Zerstörer, Lord Byte and JFS demonstrate to a small but rapt audience how Infinite Horace II achieved her fourth kill. Behind them Eightball, Rorschach617, bsplines and phuzz noisily punish pool balls while Shiloh and unacom brainstorm some new aspect of their fiendishly complicated dice-based baseball simulation (they’ve been rerunning the 1940 World Series since we arrived in Italy). JB? Amazingly, considering the hubbub, he’s dozing in the armchair next to mine, a battered copy of Moby Dick open in his lap. The room is as relaxed and cheerful as I’ve ever seen it.

Co-pilot Will Goodrich ordered an immediate bail out, but only starboard waist gunner Rich Cliveden made it out, landing in occupied France and being picked up by a German patrol shortly thereafter. Not so Lucky Lou, as it turned out. They’ll be scraping what was left of the rest of us aircrew off the rooftops in Meaulte for some time to come, I reckon.

Share this: Facebook Twitter Reddit Once I’ve typed up this sortie summary, Infinite Horace II, my latest B-17: Queen of the Skies hope chalice, will be setting off on his sixth combat mission. Unlike the original Infinite Horace, a B-17 Flying Fortress based in England and crewed by RPS writers, Infinite Horace II is a B-24 Liberator based in Southern Italy and crewed – with one exception – by foolhardy fearless Flare Path readers. The steed change was partially motivated by curiosity (I was keen to try Preston McMurray’s rigorously researched B-24 rules variant) and partially by a desire to sing the unsung. Despite being more numerous than their Boeing-designed brothers-in-arms and in many ways (range, ceiling, speed, bomb load…) more capable, Flying Boxcars have always played second fiddle to Flying Fortresses in the popular imagination. Key differences between the two types are reflected in a clutch of carefully thought-out B17QotS rule changes. The Liberator’s retracting rolltop desk-style bomb bay doors bestow benefits during bombing runs but make ditching and wheels-up landings more perilous. Weaker wings and higher stick forces mean wing root hits are more dangerous and autopilot damage is potentially more serious. The USAAF’s tendency to overburden the bomber translates into dicier take-offs. Thanks to our higher cruise speed, Shiloh, our tail-end Charlie, has an increased chance of hitting tailgaters, and because of our exceptional range, fuel leaks are slightly less worrying. The ten souls cocooned within B-24J Infinite Horace II as he droned towards the oil refineries of Fiume (Rijeka) on his maiden op were… JFS – nose turret gunner Eightball – bombardier phuzz – navigator Yours Truly – pilot JB – co-pilot bsplines – engineer unacom – radio operator/waist gunner* Lord Byte – ball gunner Rorschach617 – waist gunner Shiloh – tail gunner (Gothnak, Leafy Twigs, and Rituro are on stand-by) *Though the B-24J had two waist gun positions, only one of these was manned full-time. In the event of an attack the radio operator was expected to hurry aft and occupy the vacant position. It was a four-zone mission and trouble arrived early in the form of a determined Fw 190 attack in zone 2. Three bandits managed to slip through both our fighter picket and the fiery ticker tape parade organised by Horace’s Browning brandishers. Fortunately, apart from a nibbled port rudder and a fuel tank hit that instantly self-sealed, the Focke-Wulfs only managed to cause superficial damage. The escorts performed better when another schwarm of Fw 190s tried their luck in zone 3, but they couldn’t stop a climbing Me 109 from drilling Horace’s belly as we neared the target. Though the Axis ascender only scored one significant hit, that hit was to our bomb bay door mechanism. When Eightball attempted to open the doors at the start of the bomb run, he found they wouldn’t budge. I think it would be fair to describe the journey back to Foggia as ‘tense’. Harassed by Me 109s over the Adriatic (Shiloh came very close to opening his account. Ball gunner Lord Byte escaped death by inches when his turret was trashed) the collective sigh of relief that was let out when Infinite Horace II, still heavy with HE, touched down safely at Cerignola could have been heard in Rome. Compared to the Rijeka run, Mission 2 was a cakewalk. We watched several blazing Liberators dash themselves against the Apennines during the five-zone trip to Verona, but nestled in the middle of the formation, had a quiet time ourselves. Part of the high group, even the flak batteries ringing the cratered marshalling yard that was our target posed little danger. In the circumstances, the fact that only 20% of our payload fell where it was meant to fall, was more than a little disappointing. The bright spot of the mission occurred as we turned for home. A Zerstörer approaching from 10.30 low, danced through the twining tracer streams of JFS, Lord Byte, and Rorschach617, missed us with its own emissions, then fell to Shiloh’s Ma Deuces moments after streaking past Horace’s tail. We’d only been back a few minutes when Technical Sergeant Someoldguy set up his stepladder and began painting a small black Me 110 outline on the side of the cockpit. The Infinite Horace II story almost ended a couple of minutes into Mission 3. A post-modifier ‘1’ on table G8 sent heavily-laden Horace careering off the end of the runway at Cerignola, the lucky – bearing in mind all that fuel and HE aboard – survivor of a potentially catastrophic take-off accident. Unexpected loss of engine power? Elevator malfunction? Forgotten four-leaf clover? Flight deck wasp? The tables refused to say. Repairs were completed in time for us to join the air armada heading Rome-ward on May 3. In theory a relatively easy two-zone outing, the sky above The Eternal City was alive with Augsburg eagles by the time we turned up. Four Me 109s decided to have a shy at Horace and one attacking from 6 high had the satisfaction of seeing his shells strike aluminium. Controls cables in the tail were chafed and radio operator unacom arrived in the waist to find it pierced by unfamiliar shafts of sunlight. The excitement passed as quickly as it had come and an uneventful return leg gave Eightball and me plenty of time to reflect on another mediocre bombing display (Only 40% of our bombs were on target). Mission 5. Belgrade. Infinite Horace II is eastbound midway between Mostar and the Yugoslavian capital. His fuselage is bullet-gouged in numerous places but his crew are quietly jubilant. The reason for the high morale and the majority of the holes is the pair of crooked smoke pillars behind us. The pillars mark the terminal trajectories of two Fw 190s that underestimated the prowess of nose gunner JFS and ball gunner Lord Byte. I let the mood percolate for a few minutes before announcing over the intercom that we will be descending to 10,000 feet in order to prevent Rorschach617 from losing his extremities to frostbite (the waist heater was shot out during the attack). Everyone knows what the altitude change means. We’ll be in the flak zone come Belgrade. Cantering Mustangs do their best to keep the bandits away on the approach to the target. I’m dimly aware of discouraged Me 109s and thickening flak as we line up for the run. For a horrible moment the insanity of what we’re doing tunnels my vision and stops my breath then something, training perhaps or a sense of responsibility, kicks in and I recover. Press on. Follow Eightball’s instructions. It can’t be long now. The next few minutes are a blur. Did the flak burst hit us a split-second before Eightball released our earth shakers or a split-second after? When the unburdened Horace began rising like an elevator was Engine 3 already riddled with shrapnel and screaming? I can see JB shutting down the runaway and feathering the prop while engineer bsplines calmly assists. I can hear myself asking every member of the crew in turn for injury and damage reports. I can remember listening to the string of ‘OKs’ with mingled relief and disbelief (Shiloh doesn’t admit to his lacerated shoulder until we are halfway home). Apart from that trashed engine all of Horace’s injuries are relatively minor. Flying slivers of steel have bodkinned the nacelles of Engines 2 and 4 here and there, but bsplines can see no signs of deeper issues. Shiloh traces a new tail turret draft to a small jagged hole in the tailplane root, and Rorschach doesn’t like the look of one of the control cable conduits in the waist, but, fingers-crossed, none of these flesh wounds will prevent us getting home. Concerned P-51s watch over us as we flee Serbia. They drive off a series of bandits drawn like vultures to the straggling, slowed Horace. In zone 4 one of the predators, an Me 110, sees an opportunity and commences a curving, climbing head-on attack. Our nose guns begin to chatter as I initiate a turn (Thank goodness Horace is a B-24J rather than one of the earlier front turret-less Liberator variants). Lord Byte’s ball turret Brownings join the chorus. Tadpoles of red fire rush past the windscreen. That evening in the mess, using an empty beer bottle to represent our ship and a smouldering Diamond Joe cigar to represent the doomed Zerstörer, Lord Byte and JFS demonstrate to a small but rapt audience how Infinite Horace II achieved her fourth kill. Behind them Eightball, Rorschach617, bsplines and phuzz noisily punish pool balls while Shiloh and unacom brainstorm some new aspect of their fiendishly complicated dice-based baseball simulation (they’ve been rerunning the 1940 World Series since we arrived in Italy). JB? Amazingly, considering the hubbub, he’s dozing in the armchair next to mine, a battered copy of Moby Dick open in his lap. The room is as relaxed and cheerful as I’ve ever seen it. I guess I’m the only one that knows we’re going to Ploesti tomorrow. *       *       *   This way to the foxer Share this: Facebook Twitter Reddit From this site Overwatch Character Guide DOOM’s Best SnapMaps Civilization VI Is Exciting & Aggressive Warcraft: The Beginning review The Witcher 3: Blood And Wine review Overwatch review Article Continues Below Article Continues Below Article Continues Below Article Continues Below Article Continues Below 14 Comments 10/02/2017 at 13:16 Eightball says: Oh boy, I’m really letting the side down here. :x Log in to Reply 10/02/2017 at 13:20 Treners says: While a lot of flare path articles go over my head a bit, I must say I’m loving these AARs.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on: Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink: Purchase: Order Reprint Book a domestic flight on any of the Big Three U.S. airlines, and you won't be sure whether the seat in front of you has a screen. Some do, while most don't. Eventually, perhaps none will. The proliferation of iPhones, iPads and Android devices, in tandem with increasingly reliable in-flight Wi-Fi, has led to a profound shift by many airlines, which now view entertainment on shorter flights as best delivered wirelessly, without the expense or hassles posed by screens. As with most things on an airplane, the determining factor is weight. Planting a screen in each seat adds pounds, which burns additional fuel. On top of that, the screens have a tendency to break as people poke and punch them — often to the annoyance of the passenger in front of them. Today, the new kid on the block for in-flight entertainment, or IFE, is personal-device entertainment — the ability to stream TV and movies to passenger gadgets from a server on the plane. This video is typically free, although United still charges as much as $7.99 to watch live television channels on planes equipped with DirecTV. "For domestic flights, I really do see the industry trending toward streaming IFE," said Jason Rabinowitz, director of airline research at Routehappy. "It's cheap for airlines to install, there's no wiring, no weight penalty. These systems can be installed virtually overnight, and the costs to maintain these things are virtually nothing." Avoiding obsolescence The airlines ask: Why install seatback monitors that will be obsolete in a few years? Only two national U.S. airlines, JetBlue Airways and Virgin America (neither of which serves Minneapolis-St. Paul), still have seatback screens on all of their aircraft. The rest have a mix of both options. Southwest Airlines deployed streaming content in 2009 and has never purchased a seat with a video screen. "What we really wanted to do was stay away from the seat screen, even back then," said Tara Bamburg, Southwest's manager of mobility, in-flight entertainment and Wi-Fi. "We foresaw as much as anyone could that customers are going to continue to travel with their devices." The largest carrier, American Airlines, surprised many in the industry when it recently decided to forgo video screens on 100 new Boeing 737 Max airplanes. American said more than 90 percent of its customers carry a device when they fly, so it just made sense. American also hinted that its future single-aisle aircraft will omit video screens, even though it has 40 Airbus A321s and 737s already in the pipeline that will still have them. "Those phones and tablets are continually upgraded, they're easy to use, and most importantly they are the technology that our customers have chosen," the airline said in an internal note. "So it makes sense for American to focus on giving customers the best entertainment and fast connection options rather than installing seatback monitors that will be obsolete within a few years." And before you even ask, yes: Airlines are also rushing to add power outlets at each seat. American said half of its domestic planes will be so equipped by the end of next year, rising to more than 85 percent by 2021. The juice will be critical as people spend more time surfing, watching movies or both — either on the same device or multiple devices. That sort of terrestrial behavior is rapidly migrating onto airplanes, said Jamie Perry, JetBlue's vice president of marketing. "I watched a basketball game on the screen while doing some work on my laptop while listening to music on my phone," Perry said, describing his routine on a recent JetBlue flight. The airline has said it regularly sees more devices connected to its satellite-based ViaSat Wi-Fi service than the number of passengers on some flights. In June, American selected ViaSat for broadband Wi-Fi on the screenless 737 Max airplanes. Perry said there are 10 to 12 major annual events, such as the Super Bowl or Academy Awards, that make live television "vital" for people who are flying. "There is destination TV, and it doesn't matter how many Hollywood movies you have," he said. Delta hangs on Among the legacy carriers, Delta Air Lines has been the largest champion of domestic video screens, including those it is putting on its new Airbus A321s and Boeing 737-900ERs. But the airline has declined to add screens on shorter-haul MD-80s, MD-90s and Boeing 717s. It hasn't decided if its new Bombardier CS100s will be equipped with video screens when those begin arriving next year, spokeswoman Catherine Sirna said in an e-mail. "Delta is choosing to invest in seatback entertainment in addition to the ability to access content via mobile devices onboard while competitors remove options," she wrote. United Continental Holdings has seatback video on 221 older Boeing 737s and two dozen 757s, about one-third of its mainline fleet. All of its new planes being flown domestically, including the 737-900ER, skip screens in favor of streaming. "We're just seeing the way customers are traveling, and they prefer to use their phone, they prefer to use their iPads, they prefer to use their laptops," United spokesman Jonathan Guerin said. For the long-haul warriors worried about their next 15-hour flight to Hong Kong, calm down: Contrary to domestic flying, international fleets retain seat screens as a staple, due to longer flights. Meal service requires the tray space on which your device often sits and many airlines consider their customized video offerings an integral part of their passenger experience. So leave the spare charger at home.

By VictorReklaitis Markets writer The stock market is showing no signs of quitting this morning, after yesterday’s trifecta of record closes. What to do now? “If you are not already in the market, wait for a better trade,” suggests CrackedMarket’s Jani Ziedins. This is a place to take profits rather than initiate new longs, with so much optimism priced in since Election Day, he says. Yet it’s also “far too dangerous to short for no other reason than ‘we are due for a pullback.’” Another option is placing a few unconventional bets, and RBC analysts are aiming to provide exactly that. The bank’s global equity team has highlighted 26 stocks “where we believe our analysts’ investment conclusions are distinguished from the conventional view.” Their 26 mavericky picks serve as our call of the day, and they’re listed in the RBC table below. Netflix NFLX, +0.47%  , Yelp YELP, -13.64%  , Whole Foods WFM, -0.03%  , Dow Chemical DOW, +1.54% and Air Lease AL, +1.27%  are among the stocks that the analysts view as underappreciated. American Express AXP, +0.38%  , Boeing BA, +1.19%  and Dish Network DISH, +0.13%  are among the names where the consensus isn’t bearish enough, according to RBC’s team. The general take on Netflix and Yelp is that both companies have limited growth prospects, the analysts say. But RBC sees more big gains for the on-demand video giant, thanks to the ongoing shift away from appointment-based TV watching. “The cut-to-the-chase conclusion is that we see Netflix amassing a more than 160MM global subscriber base in 2020,” the analysts write in a note (up from 94 million). For Yelp, they see the online reviews provider “morphing from a local marketing platform to a local marketing AND transactions platform.” Among the possible stocks to short, AmEx has only two ways to go — “neither supporting upside to shares,” the analysts say. The credit-card company can either keep up its marketing spending and miss its profit targets, or it can cut spending and lose market share. RBC Key market gauges Futures for the Dow YMH7, +0.43%  , S&P 500 ESH7, +0.39%  and Nasdaq-100 NQH7, +0.29%  are edging higher. That’s after the Dow DJIA, +0.48%  , S&P SPX, +0.36% and Nasdaq Composite COMP, +0.33% simultaneously scored record closes yesterday, something they last did about two weeks ago. Gold GCH7, -0.14%  is losing ground but still higher for the week. Oil CLH7, +1.60%  is gaining as OPEC output cuts achieve record 90% compliance. See the Market Snapshot column for the latest action. The chart Evan Medeiros Twitter TWTR, -5.06%  tanked after earnings yesterday, but newsletter writer Evan Medeiros has shared the chart above showing where it really could get ugly for the stock. “The line in the sand for Twitter’s stock is clear,” he writes, flagging the $16 level. Speaking of newsletter writers, they are turning disturbingly chipper, as suggested by the bonus chart below that Schwab strategist Liz Ann Sonders has highlighted.

Sears SHLD, +25.63%  bulls (there must be some left) are having their moment, as the ailing retailer’s stock soars 38% premarket after restructuring news. High flyer Nvidia NVDA, -2.37%  is also up after its quarterly report, while Pandora P, +1.82%  looks on track for a down day following disappointing guidance. Mead Johnson Nutrition MJN, +5.62%  is another big premarket winner as the U.K.’s Reckitt Benckiser RB., -2.96%  confirmed it plans to gobble up the baby-food maker in an $18 billion deal. Some of today’s President Trump-related news: He might play nice with Japan’s Shinzo Abe, and the White House is trying to plug leaks after details of a call with Vladimir Putin were released. There is also fresh buzz about national security adviser Michael Flynn possibly discussing Obama’s hacking sanctions with a Russian official. Plus, the president called China’s Xi Jinping and affirmed the “One China” policy. Other China headlines today cover an “unsafe” Sino-American encounter between military aircraft over the South China Sea, as well as Chinese exports topping forecasts.

Catalyst Multimedia Today's Paper Topics ePaper WealthCheck SEARCH Follow Home News BUDGET 2017 Markets Companies Money & Banking Economy Info-tech Opinion Specials Portfolio BLink Agri Business Logistics Macro Economy Policy Saab offers to manufacture, export Gripen E under Make in India Our Bureau comments   ·   print   ·   T+  ·   T- Tweet New Delhi, Feb 10:   Apart from its plan to produce the mighty Gripen E fighter jet in India, Swedish defence giant Saab Group also has designs to transform it into a global manufacturing export hub as per the Defence Ministry’s requirements. Saab is already producing camouflage equipment in Gurugram and has set up a research and development (R&D) centre in Hyderabad. It also has a joint venture with Tech Mahindra in Belgaum for providing parts to Airbus and Boeing. “Saab is actually planning to go beyond Make in India. We want to make India a net exporter and provide indigenous capability to the Indian Air Force,” Kent-Ake Molin, Commercial Manager at Saab, said here on Friday. Saab is betting big on India keeping in mind the need of the Indian Air Force to modernise its aging fleet. As a result, the company is eyeing to grab a deal from the IAF for 200 single-engine jet fighters. The Ministry of Defence had floated RFIs in October last year for single-jet fighter planes to be manufactured in India. As a result, the Defence Ministry had sent out letters to three leading companies, out of which Saab was one. Saab could clear the first round. However, the government is also keen that apart from setting up their assembly lines here, the selected company should also seek to sell those aircraft from India. “We are working on the next level of requirement,” he said. Saab is facing a stiff competition with US’ Lockheed Martin that has offered to make its latest version of F-16s in India by shifting the entire assembly line out from US and putting it up here in India. “We have mobilised a robust global supply chain for India. We are not doing a copy and paste of our Sweden’s facility here. The facility we set up here will be new,” Molin highlighted. But he said the manufacturing unit will come up in India only if they are able to win the government’s programme. The company is also prepared to offer all the variants of Gripen to India – Gripen E (single seat), Gripen F (two seat) and Gripen M (maritime).

President Trump added to a string of presidential firsts on Wednesday, and drew fire from ethics lawyers, with a Twitter attack on Nordstrom. The Seattle-based retailer stoked Trump's rage by dropping his daughter Ivanka's clothing and accessory line. The implication, intended or not: Hurt my daughter's business, and the Oval Office will come after you. "My daughter Ivanka has been treated so unfairly by @Nordstrom," the president tweeted. "She is a great person — always pushing me to do the right thing! Terrible!" The government-led cheerleading for Ivanka Trump's private enterprise didn't end there. White House counselor Kellyanne Conway, in an interview Thursday with Fox News from the White House briefing room, encouraged people to "go buy Ivanka's stuff." She boasted that she was giving the brand "a free commercial here." While Trump himself is not subject to the standards of ethical conduct for federal employees, Conway is. Among the rules: An employee shall not use his or her office "for the endorsement of any product, service or enterprise." Ivanka Trump does not have a specific role in the White House but moved to Washington with her husband, who is one of Trump's closest advisers. She followed her father's approach on business ties by handing over operating control of her fashion company but retaining ownership of it. Though Trump has tweeted about companies such as Boeing, Carrier and General Motors, ethics experts say this time was different. It involved his daughter's business, which raises conflict-of-interest concerns. White House spokesperson Sean Spicer said Trump was responding to an "attack on his daughter" when he posted the tweet and that "he has every right to stand up for his family and applaud their business activities, their success." The Ivanka Trump flare-up follows revelations that first lady Melania Trump expected to develop "multi-million dollar business relationships" tied to her presence in the White House, according to a lawsuit she filed on Monday. Ethics experts have criticized Trump's plan to separate himself from his sprawling real estate business by handing managerial control to his two adult sons. The experts want him to sell his company. Most modern presidents have sold their financial holdings and put the cash raised in a blind trust whose investments remained unknown to them. Kathleen Clark, a government ethics expert, said the Nordstrom tweet is problematic because other retailers may think twice now about dropping the Ivanka Trump brand for fear of getting criticized publicly by the president. She said it was especially disturbing that Trump retweeted his message on the official White House account. "The implicit threat was that he will use whatever authority he has to retaliate against Nordstrom, or anyone who crosses his interest," said Clark, a law professor at Washington University in St. Louis. Clark defended the president's right to use his personal Twitter account to express his views, however. She noted that government workers recently set up alt-EPA accounts to criticize the president's policies. "A government employee, even a president, is allowed to tweet in his personal capacity." One of the president's fiercest ethics critics, Norman Eisen, described the tweet differently — a "bullying" tactic beneath the dignity of the president's office. "This is a shot across the bow to everybody who is doing business with Trump or his family," said Eisen, who was President Barack Obama's chief ethics counselor. "It's warning them: Don't withdraw their business." Eisen joined with other legal scholars and lawyers to sue the president last month for allegedly violating a clause in the Constitution that prohibits government officials from accepting gifts or payments from foreign governments. Though other legal scholars disagree, Eisen said such payments include foreign diplomats staying at Trump's new Washington D.C. hotel and holding events there and at the other Trump venues. Trump and his top aides have repeatedly said that Americans do not care about what Eisen and other ethics critics say. "Prior to the election it was well known that I have interests in properties all over the world," Trump wrote on Twitter Nov. 21. Two surveys released in January show that's not entirely the case. A Quinnipiac University poll found that about 60 percent of registered voters were at least somewhat concerned that the president would "veto a law that would be good for the country because it would hurt his business interests." And a Pew Research Center poll found that 57 percent of American adults were at least somewhat concerned that Trump's businesses could "conflict with his ability to serve the country's best interests." Yet Trump seems to have calculated that his base of supporters forgives — and maybe even encourages — his protective bluster about his family businesses. Nordstrom reiterated Wednesday that its decision was based on the brand's performance, not politics. The company said sales of Ivanka Trump items had steadily declined over the past year, particularly in the last half of 2016, "to the point where it didn't make good business sense for us to continue with the line for now." Retailers drop brands all the time because of poor performance, said brand consultant Allen Adamson. But given a highly charged political environment, perception is reality for loyal Trump fans. "It is clearly hard for Nordstrom to tell the story that it is dropping (the brand) for business reasons," said Adamson, founder of the firm Brand Simple.

(Dan Bates / The Herald) Super Kid Super Kid Monroe homeschooler sharpens his skills in metals classes Melissa Slager Mon Feb 6th, 2017 1:30am News You must sign in or register to continue reading content. EVERETT — Johan West, a homeschool student from Monroe, came to Sno-Isle TECH Skills Center for his senior year to take metals classes and has quickly made his mark as one of the program’s top welders. The 17-year-old gave us a tour of the shop and answered some questions. Question: So what brought you here? Answer: I really liked metalwork my whole life, and welding seemed like a good fit. Q: What kind of metalwork have you done? A: I like making knives. Q: How do you do that? A: You buy a lot of machinery that’s really expensive and watch a lot of YouTube videos. And talk to a lot of other knife makers. … A lot of (the knives I make) are hunting and skinning knives. I like the older style ones, with the nice bone or rosewood handles. They have a nice shine and quality to them. Q: So you hunt? A: Yes. I hunt deer, ducks — a lot of things, but those are mainly it. I started hunting when I was 11. That’s when I shot my first deer. Q: And making knives? A: I started playing around with that when I was 8. … It basically started with my grandpa. He was a Boeing machinist. He taught me how to weld, and it started from there. Q: What is it that you like about working with metal in this way? A: It’s creating something — out of a pile of basically scraps — to make something new and useful. Q: So what skills are you adding here at Sno-Isle TECH? A: A lot of welding skills, different types of welding. I’m learning how to fit pipe a little better. … I feel comfortable on all the machines. I know how to work all the machines, so it’s really nice. Q: What projects have you got going on? A: At Sno-Isle, I’m playing around with welding aluminum, which is tricky. At home, I’m building my own shop, so I’m not doing too much at home right now. Q: What’s next for you? A: I hope to go into the welding field and then own my own business as a welder and custom design shop. I might go to Everett Community College, but … I hope to go straight from here into business. Q: You’ve been homeschooled since kindergarten. What’s it like? A: It gives me a lot of freedom. Basically I can get my work done at my own schedule and have time for other things. Q: What else do you do in your free time? A: I like to go fishing with my brother. That’s always fun. We do a lot of things as a family. Q: Do you have any advice for a teen just starting high school, whether it’s a regular or nontraditional approach? A: Definitely go to a trade school. You can still go to college, but if you don’t like college then you at least have a trade to fall back on. It gives you satisfaction to be able to do something with your hands.

X Ryanair looks to tie down deals to expand short-haul dominance O’Leary says when Boeing and Airbus have low-cost, long-haul aircraft ‘we’ll jump on it’ about 17 hours ago Ryanair deals would see passengers book flights to their end destination via the long-haul carriers’ websites but fly European sectors on Ryanair’s jets. Photograph: iStock         Ryanair is closing in on agreements that could see it take control of an even bigger swathe of European short-haul travel. The Dublin-based company is seeking deals with carriers including Norwegian Air Shuttle, Aer Lingus, Alitalia and Deutsche Lufthansa under which its flights would help feed passengers onto their long-haul services. Ryanair would be open to adding frequencies in order to provide sufficient connectivity, and could ultimately replace many short-haul services operated by network carriers, encouraging them to focus exclusively on intercontinental routes, chief executive Michael O’Leary said in an interview. Mr O’Leary cites Aer Lingus’s short-haul business in Dublin to illustrate how the feeder plan would work.The carriers compete directly on 28 services, he said, and while Ryanair would not seek to take over “trunk routes” a deal would allow the IAG unit to forgo unprofitable peripheral operations while connecting to the 85 destinations offered by its discount rival, including Birmingham and Edinburgh. The CEO said he has offered a similar arrangement to Alitalia on routes from Rome and Milan. “The upside for us is in persuading the legacy carriers to stop trying to compete with us on short-haul because it feeds their long-haul,” he said. “Work with us on short-haul, you lose less money, I’ll have less competition.” Brexit not clouding Ryanair’s long-term thinking Ryanair forecasts full-year profits of about €1.325bn Ryanair set to buy further 100 Boeing 737 Max aircraft Summer timetable Ryanair is seeking to seal accords in time for its summer timetable, with the arrangements likely to see passengers book flights to their end destination via the long-haul carriers’ websites but fly European sectors on Ryanair’s jets. Baggage would be transferred automatically, though the agreements are likely to stop short of code-share terms in which airlines sell tickets on each other’s flights as if they were their own. “There’s nothing but upside for the legacy carriers in this except you’ve got to persuade them it’s not some scam,” Mr O’Leary said in Brussels after a meeting of the A4E airline lobby group. ADVERTISEMENT European airlines are grappling with shrinking margins after the low oil price prompted a capacity splurge that has sent ticket prices tumbling. Ryanair said this week that its fares have slumped 16 per cent this winter, and are set to continue falling, making it even tougher for full-service carriers to turn a profit on marginal routes. Of his feed plan, Mr O’Leary said: “It’s a demonstration of how we can feed a legacy carrier. If we can do it in Dublin, why can’t we do it in Italy, why can’t we ultimately do it in Germany with Lufthansa? This is absolutely the way forward for the industry.” Feeder deals With Ryanair aiming to carry 200 million passengers by 2025, up from 117 million last year, Mr O’Leary said that at least 10 per cent of the total, or 20 million clients, were likely to derive from feeder deals. He said his airline has not completely given up on offering long-haul flights of its own, while reiterating that the plan was not high on his list of priorities given the record order backlogs at plane-makers Boeing and Airbus Group. “When Boeing and Airbus have 80 or 100 spare slots for long-haul aircraft that they desperately want to shift at a low cost, we’ll jump on it. But we’re not going to kill ourselves at the moment when their order books are full out to 2020-2021.” Ryanair has also been concerned about American opposition to low-cost flights into the US operated by Norwegian Air Shuttle, Mr O’Leary said, while adding that the Scandinavian carrier now appeared to have established key principles that other airlines could benefit from. Ryanair is separately offering partners the ability to sell tickets via its own web portal as the chief executive looks to boost the company’s online presence and make it what he calls “the Amazon of travel”. – Bloomberg       Topics: Michael O Leary Aer Lingus A4e Airbus Alitalia Bloomberg Boeing Deutsche Lufthansa Iag Lufthansa Norwegian Air Norwegian Air Shuttle Ryanair Birmingham(US.AL) Brussels Dublin(IE) Edinburgh Germany Italy Milano Roma United States Subscribe.   More from The Irish Times Economy No crisis on Greece bailout deal, says euro zone finance chief Work Doing business in China: Meet face to face and mind your Ps and Qs International 1:51 Ireland ready for relaunch as Italy brace for backlash Ireland Wellness weekend at Ashford Castle: more ‘treat’ than ‘retreat’ Sponsored Why a flagging libido doesn’t have to be part of your menopause experience Why buying into the Jaguar lifestyle has never been more affordable WebPort Global speeds up exports for Irish SMEs Suites for my sweet: 10 Irish getaways for Valentine’s ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT Commenting on The Irish Times has changed.

Image Credit: NASA/MSFC This European space and technology group, MT Aerospace AG, has received additional contracts by the US space technology group, Boeing. The latest contract involves additional development work on the Space Launch System (SLS). Commissioned by the US space agency NASA, SLS is the most powerful super heavy lift launch vehicle to date and will be used on manned and unmanned missions to the moon, Mars and the depths of outer space. MT Aerospace has been developing and fabricating large aluminum segments for the propellant tanks fitted to the SLS main stage since mid- 2013. With a diameter of 8.4 meters and a length of some 65 meters, these tanks hold almost 900 tons of liquid hydrogen and oxygen and are 30 percent larger than the external tank formerly attached to the Space Shuttle.  MT Aerospace AG, a member of the European space and technology group OHB SE (ISIN: DE0005936124, Prime Standard).  http://www.mt-aerospace.de  http://nasa.gov   Topical Tags :  Agencies    Regulatory/Government    Launch    Business Moves    Service Provider      Regional Tags :  Europe    North America                 FREE SUBSCRIPTIONS Today's Top News Israel Aerospace Industries Unveils Export Version of Heron TP SSL Selected by DARPA to Develop a Sort of Space Service Station for Satellites...

Mary Ruth Jacobson 1932 - 2017 Obituary Condolences Flowers Mary Ruth Jacobson July 20, 1932 - February 8, 2017 Visalia Mary Ruth Jacobson was born in Watertown, Wisconsin on July 20, 1932. The oldest of nine children, Mary took to caring for others from a young age. She pursued this passion and graduated from Milwaukee County Hospital School of Nursing in 1953. While in nursing school Mary met Richard "Dick" Jacobson and the two married in Fort Atkinson, WI in 1954. They followed Dick's career with McDonald Douglas (Boeing) to St Louis, MO where Dick worked as an aeronautic engineer and Mary worked as a floor nurse at Deaconess Hospital. While in St Louis, their family grew with a son Brian and daughter Debra. Dick's job took them to the arid dessert of Lancaster, CA where Mary continued her career working at Antelope Valley Hospital and their family grew with the addition of two more daughters, Laura and Sharon. In 1969 the family relocated back to St. Louis and Mary went to work as a school nurse for the Hazelwood School District. Dick and Mary longed to get back to sunny California so they relocated one more time to Visalia in 1980. Mary worked for about 20 years for Tulare County Health Department in the TB clinic, finally retiring in 1999 to pursue her many hobbies and varied interests. From zip-lining in Costa Rica to touring the pyramids in Egypt, Mary had a passion for traveling and her adventures took her all around the world. She was often joined on these trips by her siblings and close friends. Mary had a passion for the arts and she was extraordinarily talented at everything she did from decorating cakes to quilting. She often frequented the symphony and plays, and was an avid painter. Her favorite subjects to paint were scenic images from her travels and her grandchildren. After a short illness, Mary passed away on February 8, 2017. She was preceded in death by her husband Richard, her son Brian (Dana) Jacobson, brother Phillip (Katie) Reuteler, and sister Joanne Reuteler. She is survived by daughters Debra (John) Meyer, Laura (Jeff) Botich, and Sharon (David) Calender, her nine grandchildren Danny (Sarah) Meyer, Erin Meyer, Andy Jacobson, Samantha (Brian) Weimann, Kaily Botich, Tarah Botich, Joel Calender, Jacob Calender, and Jenay Calender, and two great-grandsons Lucas Meyer and Jacob Wiemann. She is also survived by her siblings Jim (Barbara) Reuteler, Sue (John) Behling, Nancy Reuteler, Carol (Bill) McCool, Pat (Bert) Duncan, and Jeanne (Al) Werth. Visitation will be held at the Salser & Dillard Funeral Chapel, Visalia, on February 10, 2017 from 4:00 to 7:00 pm. A celebration of Mary's life will be held on February 11, 2017 at 11:00 am at Christ Lutheran Church, Visalia, where Mary was an active member in the church community for over 35 years.

Sanjeev MiglaniMike Stone Lockheed would switch F-16 production to India, as long as the Indian government agrees to order hundreds of the planes that its air force desperately needs. Photo: Bloomberg New Delhi/Washington: US defence firm Lockheed Martin wants to push ahead with plans to move production of its F-16 combat jets to India, but understands President Donald Trump’s administration may want to take a “fresh look” at the proposal. With no more orders for the F-16 from the Pentagon, Lockheed plans to use its Fort Worth, Texas plant instead to produce the fifth generation F-35 Joint Strike Fighter that the United States Air Force is transitioning to. Lockheed would switch F-16 production to India, as long as the Indian government agrees to order hundreds of the planes that its air force desperately needs. Trump has criticised US companies that have moved manufacturing overseas and which then sell their products back to the US. In his first few weeks in office, he has pushed companies, from automakers to pharmaceutical firms, to produce more in the United States. In Lockheed’s case, however, the plan is to build the F-16 to equip the Indian Air Force, and not sell them back into the United States. Lockheed said it has been talking to Trump’s transition and governance teams as well as the US Congress for several months on its plans, including the proposed sale of F-16 planes to India, a spokesman told Reuters in Washington. “We’ve briefed the Administration on the current proposal, which was supported by the Obama Administration as part of a broader cooperative dialogue with the Government of India,” the spokesman said. “We understand that the Trump Administration will want to take a fresh look at some of these programs, and we stand prepared to support that effort to ensure that any deal of this importance is properly aligned with US policy priorities.” India is expected to spend $250 billion on defence modernisation over the next decade, analysts say, and there is concern that a veto on making the F-16 in India would not only hit Lockheed, but also threaten other military contracts to come up in India for Boeing, Northrop and Raytheon. The White House did not respond to requests for comment on the plan to build the plane in India. A person close to Lockheed said company officials did not know what the Trump administration planned to do about the proposal to shift F-16 production to India. “They’re following it closely and talking with the White House. But if they don’t move production to India, there’s no way they’ll get the India contract,” the person said. One argument to be made was that moving to India would preserve some component production in the United States. “Twenty-five percent of something is better than zero percent of nothing,” the person said. No threat to US jobs Lockheed has said that moving F-16 assembly to India would create 200 engineering jobs in the United States to help support the production line in India. It has also said that about 800 workers in the United States making the non-Lockheed parts for the F-16 would keep their jobs if construction shifts to India. “We are offering to make the F-16 Block-70 aircraft with a local partner in India. This is an offer exclusive to India,” Randall L. Howard, head of F-16 business development, told Reuters ahead of India’s biggest air show beginning in Bengaluru next week. In India, the F-16 is up against SAAB’s Gripen combat aircraft, which the Swedish firm has also offered to make locally, as Prime Minister Narendra Modi drives a Make-in-India campaign to build a domestic aerospace industry and reduce costly imports. The Indian government is expected to decide this year on which company will build a single-engine fighter plane, in collaboration with a local partner. A defence official said the process was at a very early stage. The Indian Air Force alone needs 200-250 fighters over the next 10 years, its former chief Arup Raha said before he left office in December. Negotiating arms contracts with India can take years, and industry officials said there was no guarantee Lockheed would win the contract even if it moves production to India. Defence ties between India and the United States have grown rapidly, with US arms sales of more than $4 billion in 2012-15, mostly under government-to-government foreign military sales, upstaging long-term supplier Russia and even Israel. Lockheed’s executive director for international business development, Abhay Paranjape, said his team has met with representatives from 40 defence and aviation firms in India to help build the ancillary network for the aircraft assembly programme. “We want to be prepared, that’s why we started the ground work,” he said, adding Lockheed has also scouted possible factory sites in India. Lockheed has a joint venture with India’s Tata Advanced Systems Ltd to make airframe components for the C-130J Super Hercules transport plane and the S-92 helicopter. “The capability for building components exists here, it’s been proven with the C-130s. The challenge now is to pick the right partners,” Paranjape said.

Rodger Mallison Star-Telegram In this Sept. 2, 2015, file photo, an F-35 jet arrives at its new operational base at Hill Air Force Base, in northern Utah. Rick Bowmer AP 1 of 2 i By Alex Daugherty adaugherty@mcclatchydc.com WASHINGTON Lockheed Martin’s deal to sell a new round of F-35s at a reduced cost to the Pentagon had little to do with President Donald Trump despite the commander in chief’s boasts to the contrary. The company, one of Fort Worth’s largest employers, had planned for months to sell the fighter jets for under $100 million apiece, and both supporters and detractors of the most expensive weapons program in the nation’s history say Trump has done little to mitigate costs beyond public statements and social media posts. Trump, who loves to riff about cajoling Fortune 500 CEO’s into doing his bidding, has now positioned himself as the savior of the F-35 fighter jet program run by Lockheed, a past Twitter target. “I have already saved more than $700 million when I got involved in the negotiation on the F-35. You know about that,” Trump said on Monday at MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa, Florida. “And I want to thank Lockheed Martin. And I want to thank Boeing. And I want to thank all of the companies that have really opened up. Opened up and cut their prices.” But in reality the F-35 is years removed from a half decade of the well-publicized cost overruns in the mid 2000s. Some people call it alternative facts, I call it just flat-out exaggeration. Rep. Marc Veasey, D-Texas, who supports the F-35 program “Some people call it alternative facts, I call it just flat-out exaggeration,” said Rep. Marc Veasey, a Fort Worth Democrat who supports the F-35 program. “These cuts were already set to be put in place before Donald Trump even became president, and people have been talking about the costs of the F-35 for quite some time,” Veasey said. “The only thing Donald Trump did was spread fear and uncertainty through Fort Worth and cost the company billions of dollars when he made the stock prices go down.” facebook twitter email Share More Videos 1:09 Oroville Dam spillway: 'It's not supposed to do that' Pause 1:43 Water continues to rush down Oroville spillway on Friday 0:35 See dramatic aerial views of damaged Oroville Dam spillway 1:02 Union Pacific train derails into water south of Elk Grove 0:44 Dramatic video captures break at Oroville Dam spillway as concrete chunks sent flying 1:08 Damaged Oroville Dam spillway undergoes more water releases 1:14 UC Davis law student helps free people detained in San Francisco's airport after Trump refugee executive order 2:29 49ers GM John Lynch speaks at presser 0:31 Watch incredible water releases from Oroville Dam - 15,000 cubic feet per second 1:48 Oroville Dam spillway endangers baby salmon Share Video Video link: Select Embed code: Select facebook twitter email Lockheed's F-35 and the Legacy of Air Supremacy Since its inception, the U.S. Air Force has been developing the fastest, most powerful aircraft in the world. Today’s F-35 that combines supersonic speed, advanced stealth capabilities and integrated avionics. (video by U.S. Air Force) Just days before the November 2016 election, the Pentagon issued a $6.1 billion “unilateral” contract for 57 of the F-35 aircraft, an agreement that locked in Lockheed’s profit margin for a portion of the massive program. Lockheed disagreed with that decision because the government was able to set Lockheed’s margins without the company’s consent. That November contract decreased the cost per plane by 3.7 percent to just over $107 million per plane. “The atrocity is not that he’s (Trump) taking credit for numbers already on paper, it’s that he’s taking credit for people who did really hard work that he would like to fire,” said Richard Aboulafia, a military aircraft analyst with Teal Group, a Northern Virginia based aeronautics analysis firm. The recent $600 million cuts to the latest F-35 contract are a product of increased orders for the planes. The cuts have been anticipated for years as Lockheed ramps up production. A White House spokeswoman did not respond to a request for comment. The recent $600 million cuts to the latest F-35 contract inked by Lockheed are a product of increased orders for the planes, meaning that more demand drives down the unit cost per aircraft, and the cuts have been anticipated for years as Lockheed ramps up production. The planes aren’t just being delivered to the United States. Israel received its first shipment of F-35s in December 2016, and 11 countries are involved in building and testing the aircraft. Lt. Gen. Chris Bogdan, who heads the F-35 Joint Program Office at the Pentagon, said in December to Breaking Defense before the cuts were announced and Trump took office that he expected the newest order for planes “to come down in price significantly ... probably somewhere on the order of six to seven percent.” The announced $600 million cuts fall in the six- to seven-percent ballpark Bogdan predicted in December. Lockheed is playing ball with Trump’s recent declarations, saying in a statement last week that “President Trump’s personal involvement in the F-35 program accelerated the negotiations and sharpened our focus on driving down the price. The agreement was reached in a matter of weeks and represents significant savings over previous contracts. This is a good deal for the American taxpayer, our country, our company and our suppliers.” President Trump’s personal involvement in the F-35 program accelerated the negotiations and sharpened our focus on driving down the price. Statement from Lockheed Martin EDITORS: STORY CAN END HERE And Lockheed CEO Marillyn Hewson announced after meeting with Trump in January that 1,800 jobs will come to Fort Worth in the coming years. “We had the opportunity to talk to him about the F-35 program and I certainly share his views that we need to get the best capability to our men and women in uniform and we have to get it at the lowest possible price,” Hewson told reporters after her meeting in Manhattan. Texas Republican Rep. Kay Granger, a strong advocate of the F-35 program whose Fort Worth district holds the factory that assembles the fighter jet, was unavailable for an interview but in a statement also praised Trump’s role in the negotiations. “A lower-cost F-35 is a win for American taxpayers and for all of our allies and partners around the world who count on this fifth-generation fighter for their national defense,” Granger said in a statement. “I am pleased that the administration and Lockheed Martin came together on an agreement, and I remain proud of the talented workers who live in the 12th District and make the equipment that keeps us safe.” Members of Trump’s party and the companies who rely on federal contracts are playing it safe, said Dan Grazier, a fellow at The Project for Government Oversight, a government watchdog group that opposes the F-35. “Trump is looking for a bunch of quick victories,” Grazier said. “It’s extremely doubtful that Trump had anything to do with cost decreases. Lockheed had been talking about price reductions to the F-35 for months before election.” EDITORS: STORY CAN END HERE Grazier remains skeptical of the F-35s long-term viability, arguing that completed F-35s will exceed current costs because they will need to be sent back to the factory to be finished when research and development is completed. However, he acknowledged that the cost per plane has decreased as more are built. “This has been going on for a solid year, almost a solid year before Donald Trump really jumped into the fray on this program,” Grazier said. But there is one way Trump could impact the F-35 and take credit: lift federally mandated spending caps, known as sequestration, that limit military spending. “Back in 2013, we had about 1,000 employees laid off at Bell Helicopter because of the sequester,” Veasey said. “If you really want to start advocating for bringing down the price, I think the one thing that the president can do and take credit for is to get rid of the sequester.” “They (Republicans) control the presidency, control the House, control the Senate, they have the ability to get rid of the sequester and bring even more jobs to Lockheed,” Veasey said. “It doesn’t seem like there’s any movement on that. I’m on the armed services committee and we talk how we can save money on a variety programs, but no one’s talked about the sequester.” Star-Telegram staff writer Max Baker contributed to this report. Alex Daugherty: 202-383-6049, @alextdaugherty How the Pentagon buys F-35s The Pentagon buys F-35s in batches and negotiates with Lockheed on a total price for each batch. As Lockheed ramps up production, the cost per plane goes down. In November, Lockheed was forced to agree to a $6.1 billion contract for ninth batch of 57 F-35 fighter jets in a unilateral contract agreement, putting the price per plane at just over $107 million. In January, Lockheed agreed to a deal for the 10th batch of F-35s for a cost of less than $100 million per plane. There are three variants of the F-35 for each branch of the armed forces. The conventional version of the F-35 the Army uses is cheaper than the F-35s ordered by the Marines and Navy, which have additional capabilities for vertical landings and landing on aircraft carriers. – Alex Daugherty Related content Business & Real Estate Suggested for you Comments   Videos facebook twitter email Share More Videos 1:09 Oroville Dam spillway: 'It's not supposed to do that' Pause 1:43 Water continues to rush down Oroville spillway on Friday 0:35 See dramatic aerial views of damaged Oroville Dam spillway 1:02 Union Pacific train derails into water south of Elk Grove 0:44 Dramatic video captures break at Oroville Dam spillway as concrete chunks sent flying 1:08 Damaged Oroville Dam spillway undergoes more water releases 1:14 UC Davis law student helps free people detained in San Francisco's airport after Trump refugee executive order 2:29 49ers GM John Lynch speaks at presser 0:31 Watch incredible water releases from Oroville Dam - 15,000 cubic feet per second 1:48 Oroville Dam spillway endangers baby salmon Share Video Video link: Select Embed code: Select facebook twitter email 13 hours ago Walk through Sacramento's most expensive home on market at $5.5 million 5:01 13 hours ago Walk through Sacramento's most expensive home on market at $5.5 million 1:59 6 days ago Hot Property:Take a walk through houses of Eva Longoria, Jane Fonda, Mandy Moore 1:20 9 days ago Mayor Steinberg intervenes in fight over Sacramento Republic brand View more video Business & Real Estate Tribe spends $36 million for planned Elk Grove casino site $4,500 to rent a San Francisco apartment.

With no more orders for the F-16 from the Pentagon, Lockheed plans to use its Fort Worth, Texas plant instead to produce the fifth generation F-35 Joint Strike Fighter that the United States Air Force is transitioning to. Lockheed would switch F-16 production to India, as long as the Indian government agrees to order hundreds of the planes that its air force desperately needs. Trump has criticised U.S. companies that have moved manufacturing overseas and which then sell their products back to the U.S. In his first few weeks in office, he has pushed companies, from automakers to pharmaceutical firms, to produce more in the United States. In Lockheed's case, however, the plan is to build the F-16 to equip the Indian Air Force, and not sell them back into the United States. Lockheed said it has been talking to Trump's transition and governance teams as well as the U.S. Congress for several months on its plans, including the proposed sale of F-16 planes to India, a spokesman told Reuters in Washington. "We've briefed the Administration on the current proposal, which was supported by the Obama Administration as part of a broader cooperative dialogue with the Government of India," the spokesman said. "We understand that the Trump Administration will want to take a fresh look at some of these programs, and we stand prepared to support that effort to ensure that any deal of this importance is properly aligned with U.S. policy priorities." India is expected to spend $250 billion on defence modernisation over the next decade, analysts say, and there is concern that a veto on making the F-16 in India would not only hit Lockheed, but also threaten other military contracts to come up in India for Boeing, Northrop and Raytheon. The White House did not respond to requests for comment on the plan to build the plane in India. A person close to Lockheed said company officials did not know what the Trump administration planned to do about the proposal to shift F-16 production to India. "They're following it closely and talking with the White House. But if they don't move production to India, there's no way they'll get the India contract," the person said. One argument to be made was that moving to India would preserve some component production in the United States. "Twenty-five percent of something is better than zero percent of nothing," the person said. No Threat To U.S Jobs Lockheed has said that moving F-16 assembly to India would create 200 engineering jobs in the United States to help support the production line in India. It has also said that about 800 workers in the United States making the non-Lockheed parts for the F-16 would keep their jobs if construction shifts to India."We are offering to make the F-16 Block-70 aircraft with a local partner in India. This is an offer exclusive to India,"Randall L. Howard, head of F-16 business development, told Reuters ahead of India's biggest air show beginning in Bengaluru next week. In India, the F-16 is up against SAAB's Gripen combat aircraft, which the Swedish firm has also offered to make locally, as Prime Minister Narendra Modi drives a Make-in-India campaign to build a domestic aerospace industry and reduce costly imports. The Indian government is expected to decide this year on which company will build a single-engine fighter plane, in collaboration with a local partner. A defence official said the process was at a very early stage. The Indian air force alone needs 200-250 fighters over the next 10 years, its former chief Arup Raha said before he left office in December. Negotiating arms contracts with India can take years, and industry officials said there was no guarantee Lockheed would win the contract even if it moves production to India. Defence ties between India and the United States have grown rapidly, with U.S. arms sales of more than $4 billion in 2012-15, mostly under government-to-government foreign military sales, upstaging long-term supplier Russia and even Israel. Lockheed's executive director for international business development, Abhay Paranjape, said his team has met with representatives from 40 defence and aviation firms in India to help build the ancillary network for the aircraft assembly programme. "We want to be prepared, that's why we started the ground work," he said, adding Lockheed has also scouted possible factory sites in India. Lockheed has a joint venture with India's Tata Advanced Systems Ltd to make airframe components for the C-130J Super Hercules transport plane and the S-92 helicopter. "The capability for building components exists here, it's been proven with the C-130s. The challenge now is to pick the right partners," Paranjape said.   Tweet Go to Top Videos 'PM Modi likes peeping into others' bathroom': Rahul Gandhi Massive fire breaks out in Tata Cancer hospital People no more believe in hollowness of BJP, SP-Congress, says Mayawati UP polls: Sangeet Som's brother detained for carrying pistol inside polling booth Trump hosts dinner for Japan's PM Abe at Florida resort Meet Shawna Pandya: 3rd Indian-origin woman to fly in space 'No roads no votes' posters surface in Bhartaul after villagers decide to boycott polls Caught on camera: Govt. employee shot dead by unidentified goons SC s judgment proves rich can walk away even after killing children Uphaar tragedys convenor Videos 'PM Modi likes peeping into others' bathroom':...

(AP Photo/Evan Vucci) comments WASHINGTON — Lockheed Martin’s deal to sell a new round of F-35s at a reduced cost to the Pentagon had little to do with President Donald Trump despite the commander in chief’s boasts to the contrary. The company, one of the largest employers in Fort Worth, Texas, had planned for months to sell the fighter jets for under $100 million apiece, and both supporters and detractors of the most expensive weapons program in the nation’s history say Trump has done little to mitigate costs beyond public statements and social media posts. Trump, who loves to riff about cajoling Fortune 500 CEO’s into doing his bidding, has now positioned himself as the savior of the F-35 fighter jet program run by Lockheed, a past Twitter target. “I have already saved more than $700 million when I got involved in the negotiation on the F-35. You know about that,” Trump said Monday at MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa, Fla. “And I want to thank Lockheed Martin. And I want to thank Boeing. And I want to thank all of the companies that have really opened up. Opened up and cut their prices.” But in reality the F-35 is years removed from a half decade of the well-publicized cost overruns in the mid 2000s. “Some people call it alternative facts, I call it just flat-out exaggeration,” said Rep. Marc Veasey, a Texas Democrat who supports the F-35 program. “These cuts were already set to be put in place before Donald Trump even became president, and people have been talking about the costs of the F-35 for quite some time,” Veasey said. “The only thing Donald Trump did was spread fear and uncertainty through Fort Worth and cost the company billions of dollars when he made the stock prices go down.” Just days before the November 2016 election, the Pentagon issued a $6.1 billion “unilateral” contract for 57 of the F-35 aircraft, an agreement that locked in Lockheed’s profit margin for a portion of the massive program. Lockheed disagreed with that decision because the government was able to set Lockheed’s margins without the company’s consent. That November contract decreased the cost per plane by 3.7 percent to just over $107 million per plane. “The atrocity is not that he’s (Trump) taking credit for numbers already on paper, it’s that he’s taking credit for people who did really hard work that he would like to fire,” said Richard Aboulafia, a military aircraft analyst with Teal Group, a Northern Virginia based aeronautics analysis firm. A White House spokeswoman did not respond to a request for comment. The recent $600 million cuts to the latest F-35 contract inked by Lockheed are a product of increased orders for the planes, meaning that more demand drives down the unit cost per aircraft, and the cuts have been anticipated for years as Lockheed ramps up production. The planes aren’t just being delivered to the United States. Israel received its first shipment of F-35s in December 2016, and 11 countries are involved in building and testing the aircraft. Lt. Gen. Chris Bogdan, who heads the F-35 Joint Program Office at the Pentagon, said in December to Breaking Defense before the cuts were announced and Trump took office that he expected the newest order for planes “to come down in price significantly … probably somewhere on the order of 6 to 7 percent.” The announced $600 million cuts fall in the 6- to 7-percent ballpark Bogdan predicted in December. Lockheed is playing ball with Trump’s recent declarations, saying in a statement last week that “President Trump’s personal involvement in the F-35 program accelerated the negotiations and sharpened our focus on driving down the price. The agreement was reached in a matter of weeks and represents significant savings over previous contracts. This is a good deal for the American taxpayer, our country, our company and our suppliers.” And Lockheed CEO Marillyn Hewson announced after meeting with Trump in January that 1,800 jobs will come to Fort Worth in the coming years. “We had the opportunity to talk to him about the F-35 program and I certainly share his views that we need to get the best capability to our men and women in uniform and we have to get it at the lowest possible price,” Hewson told reporters after her meeting in Manhattan. Texas Republican Rep. Kay Granger, a strong advocate of the F-35 program whose Fort Worth district holds the factory that assembles the fighter jet, was unavailable for an interview but in a statement also praised Trump’s role in the negotiations. “A lower-cost F-35 is a win for American taxpayers and for all of our allies and partners around the world who count on this fifth-generation fighter for their national defense,” Granger said in a statement. “I am pleased that the administration and Lockheed Martin came together on an agreement, and I remain proud of the talented workers who live in the 12th District and make the equipment that keeps us safe.” Members of Trump’s party and the companies who rely on federal contracts are playing it safe, said Dan Grazier, a fellow at The Project for Government Oversight, a government watchdog group that opposes the F-35. “Trump is looking for a bunch of quick victories,” Grazier said. “It’s extremely doubtful that Trump had anything to do with cost decreases. Lockheed had been talking about price reductions to the F-35 for months before election.” Grazier remains skeptical of the F-35s long-term viability, arguing that completed F-35s will exceed current costs because they will need to be sent back to the factory to be finished when research and development is completed. However, he acknowledged that the cost per plane has decreased as more are built. “This has been going on for a solid year, almost a solid year before Donald Trump really jumped into the fray on this program,” Grazier said. But there is one way Trump could impact the F-35 and take credit: lift federally mandated spending caps, known as sequestration, that limit military spending. “Back in 2013, we had about 1,000 employees laid off at Bell Helicopter because of the sequester,” Veasey said. “If you really want to start advocating for bringing down the price, I think the one thing that the president can do and take credit for is to get rid of the sequester.” “They (Republicans) control the presidency, control the House, control the Senate, they have the ability to get rid of the sequester and bring even more jobs to Lockheed,” Veasey said. “It doesn’t seem like there’s any movement on that. I’m on the armed services committee and we talk how we can save money on a variety programs, but no one’s talked about the sequester.” ——— HOW THE PENTAGON BUYS F-35S The Pentagon buys F-35s in batches and negotiates with Lockheed on a total price for each batch. As Lockheed ramps up production, the cost per plane goes down. In November, Lockheed was forced to agree to a $6.1 billion contract for ninth batch of 57 F-35 fighter jets in a unilateral contract agreement, putting the price per plane at just over $107 million. In January, Lockheed agreed to a deal for the 10th batch of F-35s for a cost of less than $100 million per plane. There are three variants of the F-35 for each branch of the armed forces. The conventional version of the F-35 the Army uses is cheaper than the F-35s ordered by the Marines and Navy, which have additional capabilities for vertical landings and landing on aircraft carriers. ——— (Star-Telegram staff writer Max Baker contributed to this report.) ——— ©2017 McClatchy Washington Bureau Visit the McClatchy Washington Bureau at www.mcclatchydc.com Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.

An vastly important relationship beyond bilateral ties "The U.S.-China relations are of vital importance and influence not only to themselves, but also to the world as a whole," Ezra Feivel Vogel, professor of the Social Sciences Emeritus at Harvard University, told Xinhua in fluent Mandarin in a recent interview. Trump, one of the U.S. presidents with least public office experience, needs time to get familiar with foreign policy affairs, especially with the complexities of U.S.-China ties, Vogel said. "Personally I think Trump has to choose to cooperate with China on major issues of domestic and global relevance, such as trade, investment and counterterrorism, to name just a few." Former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger could agree no more. "I am optimistic that the cooperative way will prevail. Keep in mind that if China and America are in conflict, then the whole world will be divided," he said at an event hosted by the Committee of 100 and the Cheung Kong Graduate School of Business. "The peace and progress of the world depend on the abilities of the United States and China to respect each other's core interests, and to modify the core interests in order to make cooperation possible," Kissinger said when marking the 50th founding anniversary of the National Committee on U.S.-China Relations (NCUSCR). Exploring the potential for the U.S. and China to work together, where possible, on the One Belt One Road Initiative could "open windows for regional economic, political and commercial benefits to both counties," said Marc Grossman, former Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs and Vice Chairman of the Cohen Group. Adherence to One-China policy is crucial Many prominent specialists on Chinese affairs have also joined chorus of opposition to Trump's questioning Washington's "one China policy" before taking office. "Every president of both parties since 1971 has accepted this framework, and once that framework is studied, I do not expect it to be overturned ... To make Taiwan the key issue at the beginning of this dialogue is, in my view, unwise and not the most efficient way of proceeding," Kissinger said. Michael Swaine, senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, called Trump's phone call with Taiwan leader "reckless action." "It would serve absolutely no U.S. interest, and raise many risks, for Trump to entertain such a fantasy," Swaine said. "A needless blunder that foolishly complicates U.S.-China relations fails to advance U.S. interests, and calls into questioning the readiness of the Trump team to manage foreign policy," Avery Goldstein, political science professor at the University of Pennsylvania, said of Trump's Taiwan call. The Trump administration should not abandon long-standing U.S. policy on the status of Taiwan, warned a bipartisan report issued on Tuesday, calling such a move "exceedingly dangerous." The U.S.-China relations are at a "precarious crossroads" and the two world powers could be on a "collision course," said the report by an expert task force convened by the Asia Society and the University of California San Diego. All-out Trade war with China hurts U.S. itself Even though Trump and his trade team have been talking tough on trade ties with China, Eswar Prasad, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution,said that an all-out trade war with China would hurt U.S. itself eventually. "That is a situation many of my colleagues and I would not like to see," Prasad said. The U.S. became the largest recipient of booming Chinese outbound FDI in 2016, with 45.6 billion dollars worth of completed acquisitions and greenfield investments, according to a new report by the research firm Rhodium Group released on Dec. 30, 2016. However, the report noted that "the political realities on both sides pose a major downside risk to both pending transactions and new deal flow in coming months." Cumulative Chinese direct investment in the U.S. economy since 2000 exceeds 100 billion dollars, it said. Contrary to what critics say China is stealing U.S. jobs, the rising Asian power is helping create tremendous jobs for Americans. "Just give you a sense of broader impact (of Chinese aviation market) on the U.S. economy. Deliveries to China by Boeing support approximately 150,000 U.S. jobs every year, that's an incredible number," said Raymond L. Conner, vice chairman of Boeing Co., the largest U.S. exporter. Boeing has forecast that in the next 20 years, China will demand 6,810 new aircrafts with a total value of about 1 trillion U.S. dollars. This demand will make China the biggest customer of Boeing commercial airplanes. Chinese customers are expected to take delivery of 30 percent of all Boeing's top-selling 737 models and about 25 percent of all aircraft produced in Washington State and South Carolina, Conner said. Closer people-to-people exchanges enhance bilateral ties. "People-to-people exchanges between the two countries continue to strengthen even at a time we are having difficulties politically," Stephen A. Orlins, President of the National Committee on U.S.-China Relations, told Xinhua at a reception in New York to raise funds to build a panda pavilion in the city's iconic Central Park on Wednesday. "I believe we'll get to the promising land of a constructive U.S.- China relations in a long term," Orlins said. The host of the Black & White Panda Ball is The Pandas Are Coming to NYC, a nonprofit group spearheaded by U.S. Congresswoman Carolyn Maloney together with Wall Street businessman Maurice R. Greenberg, Chinese fashion icon Yue-Sai Kan and billionaire Gristedes supermarket-chain owner John Catsimatidis in 2016. The project has received support from New York Governor Andrew Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio and Chinese Consulate General in New York. "Pandas represent joy, love and friendship. It's a symbol of good luck, which our city can use more of," Maloney, who wore a black dress with white polka dots, said to guests at 45 tables in the Skylight Roof at the Waldorf Astoria New York hotel. Three million mainland Chinese visited the United States in 2016, and about 950,000 made a trip to New York. Over 300,000 Chinese students are studying in the U.S. and about 20,000 American students in China, Orlins noted, adding these young people who better understand each other's country will be "our successors" to promote U.S.-China friendship. "That will help create a lasting bond for the two countries no matter what the government does," he said.

Business ViaSat's results mixed for quarter; sets April 25 launch for latest satellite ViaSat: Betting big on satellite broadband ViaSat CEO Mark Dankberg ViaSat CEO Mark Dankberg Mike FreemanContact Reporter Satellite internet provider ViaSat posted mixed financial results for its fiscal third quarter as the Carlsbad company readies to launch its second high bandwidth satellite on April 25. Revenue came in at $381 million, up from $348 million for the same quarter last year. Net income dipped, however, to $4.2 million from $9.7 million a year earlier – in part because of a $34 million increase in research and development costs for work on upcoming satellite projects. On a per share basis, ViaSat earned 8 cents, down from 20 cents a share a year earlier under General Accepted Accounting Principles. Excluding certain charges, ViaSat earned 29 cents per share – surpassing Wall Street analysts’ forecasts of 27 cents. Revenue came up short of analysts’ prediction of $392 million for the quarter. For the first time, the company pinned down a launch date for its 300-gigabit per second ViaSat-2 satellite. It will be shipped next month from Boeing’s Satellite Systems International facility in El Segundo to the Arianespace launch site in French Guiana. Once it launches, it will take a few months to position ViaSat-2 in orbit. The satellite is expected to begin delivering Internet service to customers in the fourth quarter of 2017. Mark Dankberg, ViaSat’s chief executive, said ViaSat-2 will allow the company to offer Internet plans with 50 to 100 megabits per second speeds and much higher data caps – enough to support frequent video streaming. ViaSat’s current plans start at 12 megabits per second and have data caps ranging from 10 to 30 gigabits per month. ViaSat ended the quarter with 675,000 residential Internet subscribers, down slightly year-over-year. But its revenue per subscriber increased to a record $63.11 thanks to more subscribers choosing top-tier, more expensive plans such as its 25 megabit per second Boost offering. In addition to residential Internet, ViaSat also powers satellite in-flight Wi-Fi for some domestic flights from Jet Blue, American Airlines, United Airlines and Virgin America.  It ended the quarter with 555 planes in service. It has more 750 commercial aircraft in backlog for antennas and other gear to enable high-speed in flight Wi-Fi to each passenger onboard. ViaSat also provides communications gear and encryption services to government customers, including the military and Air Force One. Sales in the division are up 10 percent over the same quarter last year, with a backlog of $654 million.  The company’s third business division, commercial networks, posted flat revenue. It makes satellite ground equipment and antennas, among other things. With ViaSat-2 set to launch, the company has already begun work on ViaSat-3, a group of three satellites that will provide global coverage. Each satellite will have 1 terabit per second capacity -- more than three times the bandwidth of ViaSat-2.  The first of these satellites is expected to launch over North America in 2019, followed six months later by the second satellite over Europe. For the first nine months of its fiscal year, ViaSat’s revenue is up 9 percent to $1.14 billion. Earnings excluding certain chargers grew 3 percent to $257 million. ViaSat released results Thursday after markets closed. Its shares ended trading at $66.72 on the Nasdaq exchange.

The deal, which is subject to regulatory clearances, secures 1,700 jobs, mostly in South Yorkshire in the north of England, Britain's largest steelmaker said in a statement on Thursday. The speciality division is one of the world's biggest suppliers for the aerospace industry, with customers including Rolls-Royce, Boeing and Airbus. "This is an important step forward in securing a future for the (speciality) business. Today's news also marks another important step forward in realising a more sustainable future for our Port Talbot-based supply chain in the UK," said Bimlendra Jha, chief executive of Tata Steel UK. The deal will make privately-owned Liberty House one of Britain's largest steel employers with 4,000 workers. The speciality business has the capacity to make 1.1 million tonnes of liquid steel a year from recycled scrap. Reuters On completion of the deal, Tata Steel will employ some 9,000 people in Britain, around half of them based in Port Talbot, Wales, home to Britain's largest steelworks. For every steel job saved, around four jobs are retained in related sectors. UK Business Secretary Greg Clark said, "I look forward to hearing more about (Liberty House's) expansion plan. We want to work with the steel industry to transform and upgrade their sector as part of the (government's) Industrial Strategy." Tata Steel Ltd, India's biggest steelmaker by overall capacity, is in talks to merge its European operations, including its remaining British businesses, with Germany's Thyssenkrupp. The success of the talks hinges on Tata getting regulatory approval to spin off its 15 billion pound pension scheme into a standalone entity, because Thyssenkrupp will not take on the British unit's pension liabilities in the event of a merger. Tata Steel said it was seeking to develop a "structural solution for its UK pension scheme in the coming months", and it was also consulting employees on how to secure a sustainable future for its remaining British business. The steelmaker's British employees have been balloted on closing the pension scheme to future accrual, with vote results due this month. But that is only the first step towards separation of a scheme that has 130,000 members. Liberty House, part of the Gupta Family Group, expressed an interest in buying all of Tata Steel UK last year, before Tata Steel Ltd decided against a sale of the whole business in order to pursue a tie-up with Thyssenkrupp. #Liberty house#Port talbot plant#Tata steel uk#Thyssenkrupp Top Stories Uttar Pradesh Election 2017 LIVE: Western UP records 39.43% voter turnout till 1 pm; Mayawati claims BSP will win 1st phase K Pandiarajan: Minister Who Jumped Ship to Rattle Chinnamma's Camp MSG Lion Heart 2 'review': Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh launches another surgical strike on cinema Women scientists in India: What we learnt from a year of lab-hopping across the country Meeting a financial planner for first time?

With no more orders for the F-16s from the Pentagon, Lockheed plans to use its Fort Worth, Texas plant instead to produce the fifth generation F-35 Joint Strike Fighter that the United States Air Force is transitioning to. Lockheed would switch F-16s production to India, as long as the Indian government agrees to order hundreds of the planes that its air force desperately needs. Trump has criticised US companies that have moved manufacturing overseas and which then sell their products back to the US. In his first few weeks in office, he has pushed companies, from automakers to pharmaceutical firms, to produce more in the United States. In Lockheed's case, however, the plan is to build the F-16s to equip the Indian Air Force, and not sell them back into the United States. Lockheed said it has been talking to Trump's transition and governance teams as well as the US Congress for several months on its plans, including the proposed sale of F-16 planes to India, a spokesman told Reuters in Washington. "We've briefed the Administration on the current proposal, which was supported by the Obama Administration as part of a broader cooperative dialogue with the Government of India," the spokesman said. "We understand that the Trump Administration will want to take a fresh look at some of these programmes, and we stand prepared to support that effort to ensure that any deal of this importance is properly aligned with US policy priorities." India is expected to spend $250 billion on defence modernisation over the next decade, analysts say, and there is concern that a veto on making the F-16s in India would not only hit Lockheed, but also threaten other military contracts to come up in India for Boeing, Northrop and Raytheon. The White House did not respond to requests for comment on the plan to build the plane in India. A person close to Lockheed said company officials did not know what the Trump administration planned to do about the proposal to shift F-16s production to India. "They're following it closely and talking with the White House. But if they don't move production to India, there's no way they'll get the India contract," the person said. One argument to be made was that moving to India would preserve some component production in the United States. "Twenty-five percent of something is better than zero percent of nothing," the person said. Lockheed has said that moving F-16s assembly to India would create 200 engineering jobs in the United States to help support the production line in India. It has also said that about 800 workers in the United States making the non-Lockheed parts for the F-16s would keep their jobs if construction shifts to India. "We are offering to make the F-16 Block-70 aircraft with a local partner in India. This is an offer exclusive to India," Randall L Howard, head of F-16 business development, told Reuters ahead of India's biggest air show beginning in Bengaluru next week. In India, the F-16 is up against SAAB's Gripen combat aircraft, which the Swedish firm has also offered to make locally, as Prime Minister Narendra Modi drives a Make-in-India campaign to build a domestic aerospace industry and reduce costly imports. The Indian government is expected to decide this year on which company will build a single-engine fighter plane, in collaboration with a local partner. A defence official said the process was at a very early stage. The Indian air force alone needs 200-250 fighters over the next 10 years, its former chief Arup Raha said before he left office in December. Negotiating arms contracts with India can take years, and industry officials said there was no guarantee Lockheed would win the contract even if it moves production to India. Defence ties between India and the United States have grown rapidly, with US arms sales of more than $4 billion in 2012-15, mostly under government-to-government foreign military sales, upstaging long-term supplier Russia and even Israel. Lockheed's executive director for international business development, Abhay Paranjape, said his team has met with representatives from 40 defence and aviation firms in India to help build the ancillary network for the aircraft assembly programme. "We want to be prepared, that's why we started the ground work," he said, adding Lockheed has also scouted possible factory sites in India. Lockheed has a joint venture with India's Tata Advanced Systems Ltd to make airframe components for the C-130J Super Hercules transport plane and the S-92 helicopter. "The capability for building components exists here, it's been proven with the C-130s. The challenge now is to pick the right partners," Paranjape said.This news was published in The Nation newspaper. Read complete newspaper of 10-Feb-2017 here.

The President of the United States had launched a Wednesday Twitter attack at Nordstrom after the retailer stopped selling the Ivanka Trump brand. The Seattle-based store had announced February 2 that it would stop selling the first daughter’s shoes and handbags, citing “poor performance.” The 45th President of the United States had blasted “terrible” Nordstrom and accused the company of treating his 35-year-old daughter “unfairly.” My daughter Ivanka has been treated so unfairly by @Nordstrom. She is a great person — always pushing me to do the right thing! Terrible! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 8, 2017 A source speaking to Fortune confirmed that Nordstrom stock hardly flinched at the President’s criticism. According to the source, stock prices dipped less than one percent before surging and finishing the day at 4.1 percent. The big retailer’s stock had dropped to $42.47 after the tweet. However, the trade volume of 6,700 shares then surged to over half-a-million shares in a less than five minutes, closing at $44.53 on a day the rest of the market did not do well. Nordstrom’s stock price reaction is an opposing breakaway from previous Trump Twitter targets. The 45th president had taken swipes at Boeing and Lockheed Martin questioning the high costs of purchases from the companies by the Defense Department. Stock prices of these companies had tanked after the 70-year-old politician tweeted his disapproval. Nordstrom's stock closed 4.1 per cent higher after Donald Trump's tweet attacking the company https://t.co/hDozKp0w37 — Financial Times (@FT) February 8, 2017 In January, President Trump had also threatened Toyota in a tweet, warning that he would hit the company with border tax if it went ahead with a car plant in Mexico. Stock prices made available to LA Times, confirmed that the automaker’s stock plummeted to 0.6 percent that day. Stocks that had been targeted by the President before had always recovered. However, traders revealed that none of them had peaked after criticized by the President on social media. Nordstrom stocks declined temporarily, but bounced back in minutes proving that investors were not bothered by Mr. Trump deriding the big-time retailer. Some investors even revealed that they purchased more stock in a strong show of support after Nordstrom announced that it was cutting ties with Ivanka. I just bought Nordstrom's stock. I don't know what they do. I don't care. Drive it up, baby. @realDonaldTrump — Nathan Hale (@NH92276) February 8, 2017 Haven't shopped at #Nordstrom since I was 15 but bought a skirt today. Their stock is UP since dropped Ivanka trash! #DumpTrump #itsworking — Kathy Grayson (@kathygrayson) February 9, 2017 BTW. I bought three shares of @Nordstrom #JWN #stock today. As well as more shares in @Twitter – Twitter is actually a bargain right now. — brian h-k (@hkfamily) February 9, 2017 I'm going to spend some $$$ @Nordstrom at Union Square to show my support. Also I bought a boat load of their stock today. — Greg Martin (@GMPhotoNYC) February 9, 2017 The President in a subsequent tweet had questioned the rationale behind dropping his daughter’s brand and insinuated that it was a political decision. A Nordstrom spokesperson responded to the criticism meted by the President of the United States, insisting that it was purely a business decision and that the businesswoman had been informed of the decision earlier in January. “Sales of the brand have steadily declined to the point where it didn’t make good business sense for us to continue with the line for now.” Some observers have slammed the President’s tweets, pointing out that traders might rely on his tweets to carry out sharp practices in the stock market. Others opined that Mr. Trump needed to be more presidential and realize that his words are “parsed to the nth degree, every thought magnified to global significance, no matter how casual or careless.” Former press secretary for George W. Bush, Ari Fleischer said the tweets of the President were “something a father would say…not the type of thing a President of the United States should say.” The official @POTUS account just retweeted Trump’s attack on @Nordstrom. That’s a taxpayer funded account being used to benefit Trump’s kid. pic.twitter.com/vIUPxGze8X — Christina Wilkie (@christinawilkie) February 8, 2017 CNN confirmed that President Trump had sent the tweets slamming Nordstrom from both his personal account and the official @POTUS account. Trump spokesman, Sean Spicer further underlined this conflict of interest when he said the President had the right lead the country and “stand up for his family and applaud their business activities.” Kevin Drum of Mother Jones believes the Nordstrom tweet is another indication of President Trump settling a personal score from his cyber-bullying pulpit. According to him, Nordstrom is not the only retailer that dumped Ivanka’s offerings. Nordstrom sent strongly worded memo criticizing Trump's Muslim travel ban to staff 2 days b/4 dropping Ivanka's line https://t.co/AlBe4rnXge — slone (@slone) February 8, 2017 Other retailers include Neiman Marcus, Shoes, Belk, ShopStyle, Jet, and Gilt, but the President only called out Nordstrom. In a story by the Daily Mail, the company’s three presidents — Peter, Erik, and Blake Nordstrom had circulated a strong-worded memo to employees criticizing Trump’s travel ban on immigrants from seven Muslim countries. Drum feels the “thin-skinned” President, singled the Seattle-based retailer because of that.

While the part was sourced from Delta’s local engineering office and installed on the plane, a senior manager at the U.S. carrier’s Atlanta base later ordered that it be removed, it claims. “It is sad, in our view, that any airline would deny such standard technical assistance to another carrier based on orders from headquarters that had nothing to do with maintenance or cost, but seem clearly to have been intended to inflict harm on the airline and its customers,” Emirates said in an e-mail. Delta shares parts with other airlines whenever possible through an industry agreement and doesn’t withhold them from any particular carrier, Delta spokesman Michael Thomas said. The item in question was the last spare of its kind in Delta’s Seattle inventory, and company policy requires that it keep the last one on hand in case Delta needs it, Thomas said. “Having the right spare parts in the right places and in ample quantity is critical to ensuring a reliable airline operation for our customers,” Thomas said. Gulf Dispute Delta, together with American Airlines Group Inc. and United Continental Holdings Inc., is embroiled in a long-running dispute with the three main Gulf carriers after urging the federal government to block their growth on the grounds that they received illegal aid payments -- a suggestion that Emirates, Qatar Airways and Abu Dhabi-based Etihad Airways all reject. The issue may be reignited after U.S. airline representatives met with Donald Trump Thursday, with the president telling them they faced “big league” competition, much of it “subsidized by governments.” Qatar Air Chief Executive Officer Akbar Al Baker branded Delta “wicked” last year after the Doha-based carrier’s first flight to Atlanta with the Airbus Group SE A380 superjumbo was directed to a remote gate at the world’s busiest airport, leaving elderly and infirm passengers to disembark via temporary stairs rather than through the usual air-bridge. At the time, Delta said Qatar Airways was late in trying to secure gates for the A380 flight, which require special gates because of the jet’s size. Delta attempted to accommodate Qatar’s flight, despite the carrier’s tardiness, while making sure it could accommodate its own schedule, a company spokeswoman said in June. Card Payment In the incident this month, Emirates said Delta had refused a credit-card payment for the spare and ordered a local engineering provider to remove it from the 777. Code-share partner Alaska Airlines Inc. eventually came to the rescue by providing the part, leaving the flight to depart 6 hours and 24 minutes late. “Despite this incident, Emirates will continue to render such technical support to other carriers, including Delta, irrespective of whether we agree or disagree with their policy views,” the Gulf company said. Thomas, the Delta spokesman, said it wasn’t immediately clear Thursday why the company originally allowed Emirates to use the part before calling it back.

Picture: AP Staff writers and wiresNews Corp Australia Network Share Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Google+ Share on Reddit Email a friend US President Donald Trump has told Chinese President Xi Jinping his administration will respect the “one China” policy, during a telephone call between the leaders, the Financial Times reports, citing two people familiar with the call. Trump, who was inaugurated last month, said in December the United States did not necessarily have to stick to the “one China” policy, by which Washington acknowledges China’s position that it has sovereignty over self-ruled Taiwan. TRUMP LOSES TRAVEL BAN BID Judges involved in legal challenges against Trump’s immigration ban have come under threat prompting tighter security protection for them. CNN reported that while the specific threats are not known, law enforcement is treating them seriously. The US Marshals Service and local police have increased patrols and protective officers to provide security for some of the judges, officials said. Since Trump has taken office he has made verbal criticisms of judges — something that has sparked concern from former law enforcement officials and others. Just cannot believe a judge would put our country in such peril. If something happens blame him and court system. People pouring in. Bad!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 5, 2017 This comes as a federal appeals court in San Francisco has refused to reinstate Trump’s ban on travellers from seven predominantly Muslim nations. The 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals wouldn’t block a lower-court ruling that suspended the ban and allowed previously barred travellers to enter the US. An appeal to the US Supreme Court is possible. US District Judge James Robart in Seattle issued a temporary restraining order halting the ban last week after Washington state and Minnesota sued. The Justice Department appealed to the 9th Circuit. Government lawyers argued that the ban was a “lawful exercise” of the president’s authority and that the seven countries have raised terrorism concerns. The states said Trump’s executive order unconstitutionally blocked entry based on religion. It didn’t take long for Trump to make his thoughts on the ruling clear. SEE YOU IN COURT, THE SECURITY OF OUR NATION IS AT STAKE!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 9, 2017 Hillary Clinton also seemed to weigh in on the situation, posting this cryptic tweet. 3-0— Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) February 10, 2017 The US Appeals Court has ruled against President Donald Trump and his travel ban. Picture: AFP/MANDEL NGANSource:AFP KELLYANNE SPRUIKS IVANKA’S LABEL TOP White House adviser Kellyanne Conway has been slammed for defending Ivanka Trump’s fashion company after a number of US retailers dumped the brand, citing falling sales. Ms Conway told Fox & Friends on Thursday that Ms Trump is a “successful businesswoman” and people should give the company their business. “Go buy Ivanka’s stuff, is what I would tell you ... I’m going to give it a free commercial here: Go buy it today,” she said. A former top official under President Barack Obama has hit back, saying Ms Conway broke the law by telling people in the TV interview to buy Ms Trump’s clothes. Chris Lu highlighted a law which says: “An employee shall not use his public office for his own private gain, for the endorsement of any product, service or enterprise, or for the private gain of friends, relatives.” This is the federal ethics law that @KellyannePolls just violated cc: @OfficeGovEthics @jasoninthehouse pic.twitter.com/EivJeFd7wY— Chris Lu (@ChrisLu44) February 9, 2017 “This is the federal ethics law that @KellyannePolls just violated,” Mr Lu tweeted, tagging the US Office of Government Ethics and Republican Representative Jason Chaffetz, the chairman of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee. It comes after President Donald Trump launched a Twitter attack against Nordstrom when the retailer dropped his daughter’s clothing and accessory line. His tweet, in which he said his daughter was treated “so unfairly”, drew swift criticism from ethics experts. My daughter Ivanka has been treated so unfairly by @Nordstrom. She is a great person -- always pushing me to do the right thing! Terrible!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 8, 2017 After the dust-up with Nordstrom, employees at US retailers TJ Maxx and Marshalls were told to throw away any signs advertising merchandise from Ms Trump’s retail brand, according to The New York Times. “Effective immediately, please remove all Ivanka Trump merchandise from features and mix into the runs,” read a note to workers obtained by the newspaper. “All Ivanka Trump signs should be discarded.” Mr Trump has tweeted about companies such as Boeing, Carrier and General Motors. But ethics experts say this time is different because it involves a business run by his daughter — and that raises conflict-of-interest concerns. President Donald Trump lashed out at US retailer Nordstrom after it dumped his daughter Ivanka Trump’s clothing line. Picture: AP Photo/Evan VucciSource:AP POPE SEEMINGLY CALLS OUT TRUMP AGAIN POPE Francis has delivered a thinly-veiled rebuke of Mr Trump’s plan to build a wall on the border with Mexico, saying society should not create “walls but bridges”. The pontiff did not refer to the US president by name or directly mention the proposed wall, which Mr Trump has insisted Mexico will pay for. Instead the Argentinian pontiff used his weekly general audience on Wednesday to speak of a Christian calling “to not raise walls but bridges, to not respond to evil with evil, to overcome evil with good”. Pope Francis has rebuked Donald Trump’s proposed border wall with Mexico. Picture: AP Photo/Andrew MedichiniSource:AP He added: “A Christian can never say ‘I’ll make you pay for that’. Never! That is not a Christian gesture. An offence is overcome with forgiveness, by living in peace with everyone.” Last year, in response to an answer about then-candidate Mr Trump’s views on immigration and his intention to build a wall, Francis said a man with those views is “not Christian”. He said in an interview last month that he would not form an opinion of Mr Trump until he first had a chance to see specific policies the new US president would implement. As Mr Trump was taking office on January 20, Francis sent a message urging him to be guided by ethical values, saying he must take care of the poor and the outcast during his time in office. JEFF SESSIONS SWORN IN AS ATTORNEY GENERAL Alabama Senator Jeff Sessions has been sworn in as US Attorney General, despite protests from the likes of Democrat Senator Elizabeth Warren, who was formally silenced for impugning her senator colleague. During an Oval Office ceremony, Mr Trump called Senator Sessions a man of integrity and principal, and someone who has devoted his life to the cause of justice. Senator Sessions was sworn in the morning after the Senate confirmed his nomination following a contentious confirmation process. The Alabama lawmaker resigned his Senate seat shortly after his colleagues approved him on a 52-47 vote that broke largely along partisan lines. Sen. Sessions was the first sitting US senator to endorse Mr Trump. He faced criticism from Democrats, including Senator Warren, over his record on civil rights and immigration. US President Donald Trump (2nd R) watches as Jeff Sessions (L), alongside his wife Mary (2nd L), is sworn in as Attorney General by US Vice President Mike Pence. Picture: AFPSource:AFP Republicans lauded his four decades of public service and his commitment to fairness and the rule of law. Meanwhile, just before the attorney general was sworn in, Mr Trump signed three executive actions related to criminal justice, including an order to have the Justice Department and the Department of Homeland Security to tackle “criminal cartels” that have spread across the nation. Trump announced the executive actions during a swearing-in ceremony for Attorney General Jeff Mr Trump says the plan will attempt to break the backs of criminal cartels. He’s also asking for a task force to reduce violent crime in America and a plan to stop violent crimes against law enforcement officers. He calls it a “shame” what has happened to “truly great” law enforcement officers. TRUMP GOES AFTER MCCAIN OVER YEMEN RAID Mr Trump is going after Republican Senator John McCain for suggesting that last week’s US raid in Yemen wasn’t a success. Mr Trump tweeted on Thursday that Senator McCain “should not be talking about the success or failure of a mission to the media. Only emboldens the enemy!” He added that Senator McCain has “been losing so long he doesn’t know how to win anymore, just look at the mess our country is in — bogged down in conflict all over the place.” Sen. McCain should not be talking about the success or failure of a mission to the media. Only emboldens the enemy! He's been losing so....— Donald J.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 9, 2017 ..Ryan died on a winning mission ( according to General Mattis), not a "failure." Time for the U.S. to get smart and start winning again!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 9, 2017 Senator McCain said on Wednesday that any operation where a $US75 million ($98.2 million) plane is lost, a Navy SEAL is killed, and there are multiple casualties, including women and children, “cannot be labelled a success.” He is a Vietnam veteran and former prisoner of war who lost the 2008 presidential election to President Barack Obama. The Arizona Republican won re-election in November. Donald Trump has again lashed out at Republican Senator John McCain. Picture: Mark Wilson/Getty Images/AFPSource:AFP TRUDEAU TO VISIT TRUMP IN WASHINGTON DC Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is to meet with US President Donald Trump in Washington on Monday. A statement from the Prime Minister’s office said the leaders “look forward to discussing the unique relationship between Canada and the United States of America and how they will continue to work hard for middle-class Canadians and Americans, together.” Justin Trudeau and Barack Obama were more in sync than the Canadian Prime Minister is with Donald Trump. Picture: AFPSource:Supplied More than 75 per cent of Canada’s exports go to the US. Of the 50 US states, 35 count Canada as their leading export market. Mr Trump has vowed to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico. Canada’s foreign minister warned the Trump administration on Wednesday that his country will retaliate if the US applies new tariffs. SUPREME COURT NOMINEE: ‘BAN IS DEMORALISING’ Mr Trump has lashed out at a Democratic senator who revealed that the president’s own Supreme Court nominee had called Mr Trump’s attacks on the judiciary “disheartening” and “demoralising.” The US president last week called a federal judge who temporarily blocked his travel ban a “so-called judge”, before saying the appellate court panel currently considering his executive order was “so political”. Judge Neil Gorsuch, nominated last week to fill a key vacancy on the Supreme Court, criticised Mr Trump’s stance during a meeting with Senator Richard Blumenthal. Mr Trump’s own confirmation team for Judge Gorsuch confirmed those comments. US Supreme Court nominee Judge Neil Gorsuch (right) meets with Senator Richard Blumenthal in Blumenthal's office in Washington, DC. Picture: Alex Wong/Getty Images/AFPSource:AFP However Mr Trump lashed out at Senator Blumenthal, questioning his integrity. “Richard Blumenthal, who never fought in Vietnam when he said for years he had (major lie), now misrepresents what Judge Gorsuch told him?” the US president tweeted on Thursday.

She issued a statement saying Judge Gorsuch made clear he was not referring to any specific case. But she said the nominee said he finds any criticism of a judge’s integrity and independence to be “disheartening and demoralising.” On Thursday, Ms Conway said Mr Trump was “fully confident” in his Supreme Court nominee.

Mr Spicer first referred to an Atlanta attack in an interview on January 29 on ABC’s This Week. He also named the city in reference to a terror attack during an appearance on MSNBC’s Morning Joe on January 30 and in a press briefing later that day. Mr Spicer told ABC News in an email that he “clearly meant Orlando.” Mr Spicer isn’t the only Trump administration official to refer to a terror attack that never happened. Ms Conway referred to a “Bowling Green Massacre” during an interview with MSNBC last week. She now says she misspoke.

Picture: AP Staff writers and wiresNews Corp Australia Network Share Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Google+ Share on Reddit Email a friend US President Donald Trump has told Chinese President Xi Jinping his administration will respect the “one China” policy, during a telephone call between the leaders, the Financial Times reports, citing two people familiar with the call. Trump, who was inaugurated last month, said in December the United States did not necessarily have to stick to the “one China” policy, by which Washington acknowledges China’s position that it has sovereignty over self-ruled Taiwan. TRUMP LOSES TRAVEL BAN BID Judges involved in legal challenges against Trump’s immigration ban have come under threat prompting tighter security protection for them. CNN reported that while the specific threats are not known, law enforcement is treating them seriously. The US Marshals Service and local police have increased patrols and protective officers to provide security for some of the judges, officials said. Since Trump has taken office he has made verbal criticisms of judges — something that has sparked concern from former law enforcement officials and others. Just cannot believe a judge would put our country in such peril. If something happens blame him and court system. People pouring in. Bad!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 5, 2017 This comes as a federal appeals court in San Francisco has refused to reinstate Trump’s ban on travellers from seven predominantly Muslim nations. The 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals wouldn’t block a lower-court ruling that suspended the ban and allowed previously barred travellers to enter the US. An appeal to the US Supreme Court is possible. US District Judge James Robart in Seattle issued a temporary restraining order halting the ban last week after Washington state and Minnesota sued. The Justice Department appealed to the 9th Circuit. Government lawyers argued that the ban was a “lawful exercise” of the president’s authority and that the seven countries have raised terrorism concerns. The states said Trump’s executive order unconstitutionally blocked entry based on religion. It didn’t take long for Trump to make his thoughts on the ruling clear. SEE YOU IN COURT, THE SECURITY OF OUR NATION IS AT STAKE!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 9, 2017 Hillary Clinton also seemed to weigh in on the situation, posting this cryptic tweet. 3-0— Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) February 10, 2017 The US Appeals Court has ruled against President Donald Trump and his travel ban. Picture: AFP/MANDEL NGANSource:AFP KELLYANNE SPRUIKS IVANKA’S LABEL TOP White House adviser Kellyanne Conway has been slammed for defending Ivanka Trump’s fashion company after a number of US retailers dumped the brand, citing falling sales. Ms Conway told Fox & Friends on Thursday that Ms Trump is a “successful businesswoman” and people should give the company their business. “Go buy Ivanka’s stuff, is what I would tell you ... I’m going to give it a free commercial here: Go buy it today,” she said. A former top official under President Barack Obama has hit back, saying Ms Conway broke the law by telling people in the TV interview to buy Ms Trump’s clothes. Chris Lu highlighted a law which says: “An employee shall not use his public office for his own private gain, for the endorsement of any product, service or enterprise, or for the private gain of friends, relatives.” This is the federal ethics law that @KellyannePolls just violated cc: @OfficeGovEthics @jasoninthehouse pic.twitter.com/EivJeFd7wY— Chris Lu (@ChrisLu44) February 9, 2017 “This is the federal ethics law that @KellyannePolls just violated,” Mr Lu tweeted, tagging the US Office of Government Ethics and Republican Representative Jason Chaffetz, the chairman of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee. It comes after President Donald Trump launched a Twitter attack against Nordstrom when the retailer dropped his daughter’s clothing and accessory line. His tweet, in which he said his daughter was treated “so unfairly”, drew swift criticism from ethics experts. My daughter Ivanka has been treated so unfairly by @Nordstrom. She is a great person -- always pushing me to do the right thing! Terrible!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 8, 2017 After the dust-up with Nordstrom, employees at US retailers TJ Maxx and Marshalls were told to throw away any signs advertising merchandise from Ms Trump’s retail brand, according to The New York Times. “Effective immediately, please remove all Ivanka Trump merchandise from features and mix into the runs,” read a note to workers obtained by the newspaper. “All Ivanka Trump signs should be discarded.” Mr Trump has tweeted about companies such as Boeing, Carrier and General Motors. But ethics experts say this time is different because it involves a business run by his daughter — and that raises conflict-of-interest concerns. President Donald Trump lashed out at US retailer Nordstrom after it dumped his daughter Ivanka Trump’s clothing line. Picture: AP Photo/Evan VucciSource:AP POPE SEEMINGLY CALLS OUT TRUMP AGAIN POPE Francis has delivered a thinly-veiled rebuke of Mr Trump’s plan to build a wall on the border with Mexico, saying society should not create “walls but bridges”. The pontiff did not refer to the US president by name or directly mention the proposed wall, which Mr Trump has insisted Mexico will pay for. Instead the Argentinian pontiff used his weekly general audience on Wednesday to speak of a Christian calling “to not raise walls but bridges, to not respond to evil with evil, to overcome evil with good”. Pope Francis has rebuked Donald Trump’s proposed border wall with Mexico. Picture: AP Photo/Andrew MedichiniSource:AP He added: “A Christian can never say ‘I’ll make you pay for that’. Never! That is not a Christian gesture. An offence is overcome with forgiveness, by living in peace with everyone.” Last year, in response to an answer about then-candidate Mr Trump’s views on immigration and his intention to build a wall, Francis said a man with those views is “not Christian”. He said in an interview last month that he would not form an opinion of Mr Trump until he first had a chance to see specific policies the new US president would implement. As Mr Trump was taking office on January 20, Francis sent a message urging him to be guided by ethical values, saying he must take care of the poor and the outcast during his time in office. JEFF SESSIONS SWORN IN AS ATTORNEY GENERAL Alabama Senator Jeff Sessions has been sworn in as US Attorney General, despite protests from the likes of Democrat Senator Elizabeth Warren, who was formally silenced for impugning her senator colleague. During an Oval Office ceremony, Mr Trump called Senator Sessions a man of integrity and principal, and someone who has devoted his life to the cause of justice. Senator Sessions was sworn in the morning after the Senate confirmed his nomination following a contentious confirmation process. The Alabama lawmaker resigned his Senate seat shortly after his colleagues approved him on a 52-47 vote that broke largely along partisan lines. Sen. Sessions was the first sitting US senator to endorse Mr Trump. He faced criticism from Democrats, including Senator Warren, over his record on civil rights and immigration. US President Donald Trump (2nd R) watches as Jeff Sessions (L), alongside his wife Mary (2nd L), is sworn in as Attorney General by US Vice President Mike Pence. Picture: AFPSource:AFP Republicans lauded his four decades of public service and his commitment to fairness and the rule of law. Meanwhile, just before the attorney general was sworn in, Mr Trump signed three executive actions related to criminal justice, including an order to have the Justice Department and the Department of Homeland Security to tackle “criminal cartels” that have spread across the nation. Trump announced the executive actions during a swearing-in ceremony for Attorney General Jeff Mr Trump says the plan will attempt to break the backs of criminal cartels. He’s also asking for a task force to reduce violent crime in America and a plan to stop violent crimes against law enforcement officers. He calls it a “shame” what has happened to “truly great” law enforcement officers. TRUMP GOES AFTER MCCAIN OVER YEMEN RAID Mr Trump is going after Republican Senator John McCain for suggesting that last week’s US raid in Yemen wasn’t a success. Mr Trump tweeted on Thursday that Senator McCain “should not be talking about the success or failure of a mission to the media. Only emboldens the enemy!” He added that Senator McCain has “been losing so long he doesn’t know how to win anymore, just look at the mess our country is in — bogged down in conflict all over the place.” Sen.

The Arizona Republican won re-election in November. Donald Trump has again lashed out at Republican Senator John McCain.

A statement from the Prime Minister’s office said the leaders “look forward to discussing the unique relationship between Canada and the United States of America and how they will continue to work hard for middle-class Canadians and Americans, together.” Justin Trudeau and Barack Obama were more in sync than the Canadian Prime Minister is with Donald Trump.

Mr Trump has vowed to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico. Canada’s foreign minister warned the Trump administration on Wednesday that his country will retaliate if the US applies new tariffs. SUPREME COURT NOMINEE: ‘BAN IS DEMORALISING’ Mr Trump has lashed out at a Democratic senator who revealed that the president’s own Supreme Court nominee had called Mr Trump’s attacks on the judiciary “disheartening” and “demoralising.” The US president last week called a federal judge who temporarily blocked his travel ban a “so-called judge”, before saying the appellate court panel currently considering his executive order was “so political”. Judge Neil Gorsuch, nominated last week to fill a key vacancy on the Supreme Court, criticised Mr Trump’s stance during a meeting with Senator Richard Blumenthal. Mr Trump’s own confirmation team for Judge Gorsuch confirmed those comments.
