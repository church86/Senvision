"When the planes land from the west, they swoop low over the beach and this is a thrill for beachcombers and aviation spotters. The plane depicted here is a B777-300ER of Etihad Airways." Plane spotting: How a beginner can ID commercial jets By Karla Cripps, CNN Updated 10:34 PM ET, Thu March 16, 2017 Chat with us in Facebook Messenger. Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds. (CNN)"That's not an A330, it's an A320." Don't you just hate getting stuck seated next to that guy on the plane? The person who can take one look at a jet and knows right away which company manufactured it and which family it belongs to, but can also throw in some random facts about its performance. With so many online resources allowing aviation fanatics to track planes and share their favorite photos and experiences, plane-spotting has become a more alluring hobby than ever. Ready to grab your binoculars? Read More Here are some tips and tricks to get you started. The difference is in the details "Identifying an airplane from a distance is a skill that comes with familiarity and the only way to gain that is to be around airports and ogling at airplanes as regularly as one could," says Kok Chwee Sim, a Singapore based aviation photographer who began plane-spotting in the early 1970s as a child. Could Russian plane challenge Airbus, Boeing "There is of course the overall shape of the airplane to note but there comes a point where one plane looks like another. So there are other details that one could look to for clues." Where to begin? Matt Falcus, founder of Airportspotting.com and author of World Airports Spotting Guides, says it can get tricky because many airliners do indeed look similar, especially those built by Airbus and Boeing, the two main manufacturers. "However, you can start to distinguish airliners by the number of engines they have, or by whether they are a large long-haul aircraft which travel long distances, or a short/medium-haul aircraft which travel on domestic or regional flights." There are also clues in the shape of the nose, tail position, wing shape, number of doors, the landing gear, the position of the horizontal stabilizer near the tail and even the shape of the cockpit windows. Sky pioneers: The light aircraft revolution For instance, if you look at most Boeing cockpit windows, they're usually slanting upward in a V shape. Airbus windows, on the other hand, have more of a square shape. Keep in mind this isn't always the case, with Airbus' new A350 XWB featuring black sunglasses-shaped windows. Photos: What's the big difference? Airbus A320 vs Boeing 737 series – These two narrow-body, twin-engine, single-aisle planes are among the most common commercial jets in the world. To an amateur, it can be difficult to spot which is which given they're very similar in size. The secret is to look at the nose and tail shape. Hide Caption 1 of 5 Photos: What's the big difference? Airbus A330 vs. Boeing 787 series – Again, these two wide-body twin-engine jets are similar in size but their nose shapes offer an easy hint. Another giveaway? The Boeing 787 has a jagged engine cowling, or cover, and a raked wing tip. Hide Caption 2 of 5 Photos: What's the big difference? Airbus A340 vs. Boeing 777 series – Though both planes are commonly used for long-haul flights, these wide-body jets differ dramatically in appearance. The Airbus A340 has four engines, while the Boeing 777 has two. Hide Caption 3 of 5 Photos: What's the big difference? Airbus A350 vs. Boeing 777 series – This pairing is to become more relevant in the coming years given Airbus stopped producing the A340 in 2011. Its successor, the Airbus A350, is a twin-engine wide-body jet airliner with a raked wing tip and a conical exhaust vent. Hide Caption 4 of 5 Photos: What's the big difference? Airbus A380 vs. Boeing 747 series – Now this one's easy. Both might have four engines but the A380 -- the world's largest passenger jet -- is a double decker while the 747 has one and a half decks. Hide Caption 5 of 5 "At night and in darkness, one could even distinguish a Boeing aircraft from an Airbus aircraft by the way the strobe -- the white light at the tip of the wing -- blinks," says Sim. Airbus wingtip strobes flash twice in quick succession, Boeing lights flash only once. So how about when it's flying above you? "As a tip, one way you can always identify Airbus aircraft when flying overhead is by looking at the center wing box area (under the aircraft in the middle)," says Airbus' Asia communications director Sean Lee. Related Article: Airliner with most seats ever unveiled "The wing box area on Airbus aircraft is square and more pronounced than on Boeing aircraft." Looking at the size of the plane will allow you to narrow it down further. Airbus and Boeing planes can be broken down into two groups -- narrow-body and wide-body. Narrow-body planes only have one aisle, wide-body planes have two. Airbus' narrow-body planes fall into the A320 family: A318, A319, A320 and A321. Boeing has the 737 and 757, each of which comes in different size models. For the wide-bodies, Airbus has the A300, A330, A340, A380 and A350 families (A300s and A340s are no longer in production). Why the sun is setting on the 747 Boeing's current roster of twin-aisle jets includes the 747, 767, 777 and 787. (Again, there are several versions of planes in each family. Confused yet?) Handy tip: The only planes with four engines in the above group are Boeing 747s, Airbus A340s and A380s. JUST WATCHED See Boeing Dreamliner built in hyperspeed Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH See Boeing Dreamliner built in hyperspeed 01:15 As the photo at the top of this article shows, you can easily ID a Boeing 777 because it has three sets of main landing gear wheels. All other Boeing and Airbus planes have two-wheeled gear. How to know you're looking at a Boeing 777-300? It's longer than most single-deck planes and has five doors on each side of the aircraft. Also, you can always tell you're looking at an Airbus A350 because it's the only airliner with curly wingtips, while the Boeing 787 Dreamliner has a unique "jagged" engine covering. For more tips on differentiating between some of the most popular Airbus and Boeing planes, check out the below gallery. Photos: Popular planes and how to recognize them Boeing 787 Dreamliner – Boeing's 787 Dreamliner has been in commercial service since 2011. There are currently two variants -- the 787-8 and the 787-9 (pictured). Its unique jagged nacelle (engine cover) makes it easy to spot. Hide Caption 1 of 11 Photos: Popular planes and how to recognize them Airbus A350XWB – The new generation Airbus A350XWB entered commercial service in January 2015. There are three sizes -- the A350-800, A350-900 and A350-1000 -- but the only one in service now is the A350-900. Plane-spotting tip: It's the only airliner with curly wingtips. Hide Caption 2 of 11 Photos: Popular planes and how to recognize them Boeing 737 – Chances are you've flown on a 737, which has been around since 1967 and is the best-selling airplane of all time. It comes in several variants. To distinguish it from the Airbus A320, look at the nose. It's pointier. Hide Caption 3 of 11 Photos: Popular planes and how to recognize them Airbus A320 – The A320 is one of the world's best selling aircraft thus a popular sight on runways around the world. Its forward tail is straight and flush with the fuselage, unlike its short-haul rival, the Boeing 737, which has a V connection (see previous photo). Hide Caption 4 of 11 Photos: Popular planes and how to recognize them Airbus A330 – The wide-body twin-engine Airbus A330 is primarily used on medium to long-range flights. It has a large wing tip and a pointed nose. It comes in two sizes -- the A330-200 and the longer A330-300 -- and has been in service since 1994. Hide Caption 5 of 11 Photos: Popular planes and how to recognize them Boeing 757 – On November 28, 2005, Boeing wrapped up the 23-year run of the single-aisle 757 passenger airplane with the delivery of the 1,050th and final plane to Shanghai Airlines. There are still hundreds of them in service though. They come in two versions -- the 757-200 and the 757-300. Hide Caption 6 of 11 Photos: Popular planes and how to recognize them Boeing 767 – The 757 is often confused with Boeing's larger 767. Coming in three size variants, the 767 was the company's first wide-body twin-jet and took its first flight in 1981. Differences between the two Boeing families include size, nose shape and position of the front wheel. Hide Caption 7 of 11 Photos: Popular planes and how to recognize them Airbus A340 – Only the Airbus A380, the A340 (pictured) and Boeing 747s have four engines. Unlike the Boeing 777, the A340 has a conical exhaust vent. Expect to see fewer A340s in the skies as the years pass given Airbus stopped producing them in 2011. Hide Caption 8 of 11 Photos: Popular planes and how to recognize them Boeing 777 – The Boeing 777 family comes in two sizes -- the 777-200 and the 777-300. How to know you're looking at a Boeing 777-300? It's longer than other single-deck planes and has five doors on each side of the aircraft. Hide Caption 9 of 11 Photos: Popular planes and how to recognize them Airbus A380 – No prizes for picking this one out of the skies. In 2007, the four-engine Airbus A380 "superjumbo" took the place of the Boeing 747 as the world's largest passenger jet, first entering commercial service with Singapore Airlines. It's the only aircraft with two decks. Hide Caption 10 of 11 Photos: Popular planes and how to recognize them Boeing 747 – Sadly these beautiful birds will likely become harder to spot, with Boeing recently announcing their manufacturing rate is to be halved to six a year. The world's first wide-body airline, the Boeing 747 went on to change not only aviation but the entire tourism industry. Like the A380, it's an easy one to spot -- it's the only plane with an extra half deck. Hide Caption 11 of 11 Listen to the engine "Once you start to get really good, you'll even notice the difference in sounds made by the plane's engines, says Sim. "When a plane approaches with a sound that we could not recognize, it is time to get really excited." He points to one such plane-spotting experience he enjoyed last year in Singapore. "Turned out it was an Ilyushin IL-76 of the Indian Air Force that arrived ahead of India's prime minister." Rare birds With a solid base of aviation knowledge spotters will likely start noticing planes made by other manufacturers. Bombardier and Embraer are also significant players in the commercial aviation game, with their narrow-body CRJ and ERJ series popularly used for regional flights. Related Article: Why the sun is setting on the Boeing 747 Then there are the planes that are no longer in production thus becoming increasingly rare -- making them a hot target for plane spotters. "More regularly, I am excited by a group of planes known to us as 'trijets' as well as all versions of the Boeing 747," says Sim. "These are airplanes with three engines. I'm mostly excited by the wide-bodied ones such as the McDonnell Douglas DC-10, the Lockheed L-1011 TriStar and the Boeing MD-11." Photos: Rare birds Ilyushin Il-62 – Entering commercial service in 1967, the Ilyushin Il-62 was the Soviet Union's first long-range jetliner. Its successor, the more fuel efficient Il-62M (pictured), came along in 1974. Want to see one take off? North Korean airline Air Koryo has a couple in its fleet. Simon Cockerell of Koryo Tours tells CNN they're available for domestic charter trips and no longer fly internationally. Hide Caption 1 of 7 Photos: Rare birds McDonnell Douglas DC-10 – Flying in one of these old work horses commercially might not be an option given that Bangladesh Biman retired the last one in operation in 2013. But cargo companies like FedEx and UPS still use them, which means you've got a good chance of seeing one at an airport near you. Hide Caption 2 of 7 Photos: Rare birds McDonnell Douglas MD-11 – This KLM McDonnell Douglas MD-11 took its final flight in 2014. It was the last carrier to operate the trijet plane on passenger flights. Like the DC-10, UPS and FedEx still have quite a few MD-11s in service though. Hide Caption 3 of 7 Photos: Rare birds Lockheed L1011 TriStar – Among the rarest of the "trijet" birds is the Lockheed L1011 TriStar. A representative of Lockheed's tech ops department told CNN the only known flying L-1011 is operated by U.S. firm Orbital Science, which uses it for airborne launches of satellite booster rockets. There are also three U.S. registered TriStars in Amman, Jordan. Hide Caption 4 of 7 Photos: Rare birds Tupolev-154 – This three-engine medium-range narrow-body airliner was designed in the mid-1960s. Belavia, the national airline of Belarus, was the last European carrier to operate the Tupolev TU-154 and made its final flight in 2015. For those interested in flying in one, a UK travel company is offering a North Korea charter tour in May 2016 that includes flights aboard a number of rare Russian aircraft. Hide Caption 5 of 7 Photos: Rare birds Airbus A300-600ST – OK, so this one isn't a commercial passenger jet. But considering it carries the pieces used to make them we had to include it. Your best chance of seeing one of Airbus' "Beluga" transporter planes in flight is by heading to company headquarters in Toulouse, France. More than 60 flights are performed each week between 11 sites, carrying parts for all of the Airbus programs. Hide Caption 6 of 7 Photos: Rare birds Boeing 747 Dreamlifter – The Boeing Dreamlifter is a modified 747-400 passenger airplane that can haul more cargo by volume than any other jet in the world. Boeing has a fleet of four Dreamlifters, which it primarily uses to transport the large composite structures of the 787 Dreamliner from partners around the world to Everett, Washington for final assembly. Hide Caption 7 of 7 Sim says that, sadly, these are increasingly difficult to see. In recent years, for instance, the passenger DC-10, MD-11 and TriStar have gone into retirement. "The only MD-11s flying are those hauling freight. There are other narrow-bodied trijets such as the Boeing 727 and the Tupolev TU-154, which also get me excited." Sim also points to Russian-built airliners from two manufacturers -- Ilyushin and Tupolev -- as being in demand among plane-spotters. Airbus Beluga: The world's strangest-looking plane "These sadly again are decreasing in numbers," he says. "From this, it sounds like my hobby is in decline. Not at all. New types such as the B787 Dreamliner and the Airbus A350XWB are now flying. "Both have sleek shapes and in years to come, they too will appear in the liveries of many different airlines and I am certain I will be diligently chasing these at airports around the world." Related Article: Russian woman's remarkable mission to restore Soviet jet airliner Falcus agrees. "When I see something from my youth, such as a Boeing 727 or Douglas DC-10, or even something much older like a DC-3 Dakota, I get really excited," he says. "However, it's also great to see something ultra-modern, like the brand new Airbus A350 or Boeing 787 Dreamliner, which have amazing technology on board and can travel very long distances." Tips and gear Plane-spotting is not a hobby for those who value their creature comforts, warns Sim. "There will be many occasions when one is the only person at a spotting location, and there is every likelihood that this location is accessible by way of a long trek with no public facilities nearby," he says. "It is also very exposed to the elements." Related Article: Giant of the skies set to get even larger Not deterred? Falcus says before you head to your local airport runway it's good to have some basic equipment for plane-spotting, such as a pair of binoculars, a camera, a notebook and pen. "Using your smartphone you could download apps such as Flightradar 24, and visit websites such as Airliners.net and AirportSpotting.com," he adds. (More online resources below.) Next step: get familiar with the schedules of all the airlines flying into your local airport. "One should also keep a lookout for news of visits by government leaders or music bands," says Sim. "Such visits could mean seeing airplanes that normally are not seen at your airport." This photo of an Air France Airbus A340 flying into Princess Juliana International Airport was taken at St. Maarten's Maho Beach. Top airports for plane-spotting "There are some really good airports around the world for plane-spotting," says Falcus. Here are a few of his favorites. London Heathrow, UK: "This is one of the busiest airports in the world and you will see airlines from all corners of the globe, with one landing or taking off every minute! There are some good locations to watch aircraft at the ends of the runways." Princess Juliana International Airport, St. Maarten, Caribbean: "The beach here is at the end of the runway, so sunbathers can get blown away by big jets landing only a few meters above their heads!" St. Maarten's Maho Beach recently hooked up a live camera at Sunset Bar & Grill, a popular spot for people to sit and watch the planes take off and land. Take a look here: Mahobeachcam.com. Related Article: Boeing planes that changed the way we travel Hong Kong International: "The airport at Hong Kong is very busy, with jets coming from all over Asia, Europe and North America. It has a good viewing terrace on top of the terminal to watch aircraft from." Los Angeles International: "Spending time here is always interesting as you can see lots of aircraft come and go, and it's always busy. Not to mention the sun is usually shining, so you can take some great pictures." More specifically, the In and Out Burger is a popular hangout for spotters as you can watch the planes fly overhead. Imperial Hill at LAX is another place where many of the best spotters gather to get great photos. Toulouse, France: "This is a small airport, but it is the home of Airbus and the place where many of their aircraft are built. You can take a tour and see the aircraft being put together, and then watch them take off on their first test flights." Security concerns Plane-spotters should check with local airport police before spotting to avoid getting arrested or ticketed. Related Article: #Avgeeks: The new warriors on terror "Spotting in locations such as Singapore where the hobby is less understood, the biggest challenge is posed by the security," says Sim. "Even as one is clearly and visibly harmless near an airport, security personnel tend to insist that one moves on and not spot or photograph airplanes. "Thankfully, there are many airports in Japan, Canada, Australia, Malta and some U.S. cities such as Los Angeles where aviation spotting and photography are well accepted." Members of a spotter group at Chicago O'Hare even work with the police, FBI and TSA to help guard the facility. Top plane-spotting websites and apps If you're close enough to see the registration number, located on the side of the plane near the tail, a quick online search will give you plenty of details on the aircraft, including when it was made and by which manufacturer, which airlines have flown it and the type of engines it's fitted with. For U.S.-registered planes, head to Regosearch.com or the FAA's online plane registration database -- Registry.faa.gov/aircraftinquiry. By entering the plane's N-Number -- N796UA -- on the FAA's plane registration site, we learn this is a Boeing 777 manufactured in 1998 and registered to United Airlines. Flightradar24 is a website and app that offers real-time info about thousands of aircraft around the world, searchable by registration number, flight number or airline. Planespotters.net is another excellent resource that features info on airline fleets, production stats, the latest plane deliveries and photos taken by members of the airplane-spotting community from around the world. Similarly, Flightaware.com is a free website that offers live flight data and info on everything from airport delays and fuel prices to flight routes, plus aviation news and plane photos. NYCAviation.com offers plane-spotting guides for all of New York and other major U.S. airports, as well as interesting and in-depth aviation-related articles and galleries.

The White House announced nominees for six senior Pentagon jobs on Thursday, including Shanahan for deputy secretary of defense. (AP Photo/Ted Warren)   By Robert Burns The Associated Press March 17, 2017   Today’s Business stories Coffee entrepreneurs grow two separate businesses Solar experiment allows neighbors to trade energy How the Internet is saving culture, not killing it Business Beat Business Datebook More Business »   WASHINGTON — The White House announced nominees for six senior Pentagon jobs on Thursday, including a longtime Boeing Co. executive for deputy secretary of defense, moving to fill out Defense Secretary Jim Mattis’ new team. President Trump has struggled to fill top Defense Department positions. Mattis is the only administration nominee to be confirmed at the Pentagon. Until Thursday, the administration had only announced four other nominees; two of those later withdrew. Trump’s pick for deputy secretary is Patrick Shanahan. The latest manifestation of Mattis’ struggle came earlier this week when he abandoned an effort to get White House approval for his choice of policy chief, Anne Patterson, a career diplomat who was opposed by some Senate Republicans. The White House’s nominees list Thursday didn’t include a new policy chief, but it did name a deputy policy chief. All the jobs require Senate confirmation. As deputy secretary of defense, Shanahan would succeed Robert Work, a former Marine and Obama administration holdover. Work is the only senior Pentagon official from the prior administration still in place, although others have been performing the duties of senior officials in the absence of Trump nominees. Shanahan moved up through the management ranks at Boeing over a career that began in 1986. The Puget Sound Business Journal called him a Boeing “fix-it” man in a March 2016 report on Shanahan’s promotion to his current position. He oversees the company’s global supply chain strategies and use of advanced manufacturing technologies. Shanahan was a central to getting the 787 Dreamliner on track after production problems in the program’s early years, the report said. Boeing’s website says Shanahan is a member of the company’s executive council, reporting directly to the chairman and president, Dennis Mullenburg. Shanahan previously was senior vice president of airplane programs from 2008 to 2016 and vice president and general manager of Boeing Missile Defense Systems. A Washington state native, Shanahan is currently chairman of the University of Washington’s Board of Regents. He holds a bachelor of science degree in mechanical engineering from the University of Washington and two advanced degrees from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

As he faces confirmation, the executive's history at Boeing will undoubtedly raise some questions about possible conflicts of interest involving his former employer. Existing close ties between the Trump administration and Boeing, one of the largest US defense contractors, could also muddy the waters. Shanahan, who is currently Boeing's senior vice president of supply chain and operations, was tapped for deputy defense secretary Thursday along with nominees for five other vacant Pentagon roles under Defense Secretary James Mattis. One is David Joel Trachtenberg, who was was selected as principal deputy undersecretary of defense. Currently CEO of national security consulting company Shortwaver, he previously served as the vice president and head of the strategic analysis division at CACI-National Security Research, a large defense contracting company that specializes in cyber analytics, counter intelligence and other services to disrupt terrorist activities. "These are all highly qualified individuals who were personally recommended by Secretary Mattis to the President for nomination," Pentagon spokesman Capt. Jeff Davis told CNN. Most of Shanahan's recent job experience at Boeing lies on the company's commercial side, where he managed the 737, 747, 767, 777 and 787 airliner programs. But he has also spent time running two of the manufacturing giant's defense divisions as the vice president and general manager of both Boeing Missile Defense Systems and Rotorcraft Systems. If confirmed by the Senate, Shanahan would have to pledge to recuse himself from issues involving his former employer for two years, according to an executive order pertaining to ethical commitments of executive branch appointees that Trump signed in January. Shanahan will also be expected to divest himself of Boeing-related financial interests before taking the job. Once a target of Trump's Twitter ire, Boeing has risen to significant influence inside the Trump White House. Earlier this year, Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg told reporters that he has an open dialogue with the President. Trump has met with Muilenburg on several occasions since the election and the two worked together to reduce the cost of a replacement for Air Force One, according to a CNN Money report. The President also used the Boeing-produced F/A-18 Super Hornet fighter jet as leverage against competitor Lockheed Martin in price negotiations for 90 F-35 Joint Strike Fighters earlier this year. Mandy Smithberger, a director at the Washington-based watchdog group Project on Government Oversight, said the F-35 program is a major source of concern for possible conflicts of interest as the Pentagon continues to review ways to cut costs to the country's most expensive weapons program. If the Pentagon decides to make major cuts to the F-35 program in favor of a different aircraft, she said, that would be a situation "where Boeing can benefit substantially." And while there are federal regulations and ethical codes in place to help prevent blatant conflicts of interest, Smitherberger stressed the importance of public involvement to hold officials accountable. Trump submitted a supplemental budget request to Congress on Thursday, proposing an additional $30 billion in defense funding for the rest of 2017. Several big-ticket military priorities are highlighted in the proposal as "urgent warfighting readiness needs," including a $13.5 billion request that is partially designated to fund both the Lockheed-made F-35 and Boeing's F/A-18 Super Hornet. Nominating an executive of a major defense company to take a leading role at the Pentagon is not unprecedented President Barack Obama's first pick for deputy secretary of defense, Bill Lynn, was a lobbyist for defense contractor Raytheon before assuming the role in 2009.

Aside from the deputy secretary of defense, the new appointees would take posts left unoccupied since Trump took office. Bob Work, the current deputy secretary of defense, agreed to stay in his role following the inauguration until his replacement was nominated. “These are all highly qualified individuals who were personally recommended by Secretary (James) Mattis” to the president for nomination, said Pentagon spokesman Navy Capt. Jeff Davis in a statement. “Secretary Mattis is grateful to Deputy Secretary Bob Work for agreeing to continue serving until his successor is confirmed. His steady leadership is critical during this time of transition, and Secretary Mattis continues to have full confidence in him as he carries out crucial work in managing in the Department.” Work’s successor, if confirmed by the Senate, will be Patrick Shanahan, the senior vice president of supply chain operations for Boeing. While Shanahan’s recent posting at the aeronautics giant was on the commercial side, overseeing programs like the 737 and 747 airliners, he also did stints as vice president and general manger of both Boeing Missile Defense Systems and their military rotorcraft division in Philadelphia. Trump has met multiple times with Boeing executives since he was elected, leaning on the company to reduce the cost of the replacement for Air Force One and also as leverage to the same for Lockheed Martin’s massive F-35 program. In February, Trump held a rally at the Boeing plant in South Carolina where he ended his speech with “God Bless Boeing.” While Shanahan’s time in the company might highlight Trump’s propensity to lean on the revolving door of the defense industry and the U.S. military, former president Barack Obama’s first pick for deputy secretary of defense, William Lynn, was a lobbyist for the defense giant Raytheon before taking the role in 2009. For principal deputy undersecretary of defense for policy, Trump has nominated David Joel Trachtenberg, according to the news release. He is the president and chief executive of Shortwaver Consulting and a former House Armed Services Committee staffer. Trachtenberg’s boss, the deputy undersecretary of defense for policy, has yet to be nominated. In recent days, Mattis withdrew his recommendation — senior diplomat Anne Patterson — after friction from some within the Trump administration. David Norquist has been picked to serve as the Pentagon’s comptroller. He is a partner with the accounting firm Kearney and Co. and served as the first chief financial officer for the Department of Homeland Security. Elaine McCusker would serve under Norquist. She is the current director of resources and analysis at the U.S. Central Command based out of Tampa. She has served on the Senate Armed Services Committee as a professional staffer, in the Department of the Navy and in the Pentagon’s comptroller office. Kenneth Rapuano, if confirmed, will be the assistant secretary of defense for homeland defense and global security. He is the senior vice president and director of the studies and analysis group at the ANSER Corp. Rapuano is also a former White House deputy homeland security adviser and Marine. He has deployed and spent time in both the active and reserve components of the military and as a civilian at the Pentagon, according to the news release. Robert Daigle will helm the Pentagon’s Office of Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation, a branch of the department that oversees and studies various Pentagon initiatives. Daigle worked at the office under George W. Bush’s administration.     Washington Post As you comment, please be respectful of other commenters and other viewpoints.

The White House gave no explanation as to why Trump has tapped Patrick Shanahan, Boeing's senior vice president in charge of supply chain and operations, for the top Pentagon position at a time when the US is grappling with global security challenges. Patrick Shanahan, a senior Boeing Company official (Yonhap) Other positions Shanahan served in at Boeing include senior vice president of airplane programs at Boeing Commercial Airplanes where he oversaw the management of profit and loss for the 737, 747, 767, 777 and 787 programs. He also served as vice president and general manager of Boeing Missile Defense Systems and vice president and general manager for Rotorcraft Systems in Philadelphia, where he was responsible for all US Army Aviation, including the Bell-Boeing V-22 Osprey tiltrotor, the CH-47 Chinook and the AH-64D Apache attack helicopter, the White House said.

The markets were anticipating an increase in a key interest rate by the Federal Reserve, which the Fed announced Wednesday. Mortgage buyer Freddie Mac said Thursday that the rate on 30-year, fixed-rate loans climbed to 4.30 percent from 4.21 percent last week. The benchmark rate stood at 3.73 percent a year ago and averaged 3.65 percent through 2016, the lowest level in records dating to 1971. The rate on 15-year mortgages increased to 3.50 percent from 3.42 percent last week. The average fee for 30- and 15-year mortgages was unchanged this week at half a point. — Associated Press Also in Business ● McDonald’s said Thursday that it has been notified by Twitter that its account was “compromised” after it appeared to send a message calling President Trump “a disgusting excuse of a President.” The tweet to Trump from the official account for McDonald’s Corp. said it would love to have Barack Obama back in the White House. “Also you have tiny hands,” the tweet said. ● Hyundai is recalling nearly 978,000 cars in the United States because the front seat belts could detach in a crash.

This is the first multi-year agreement for the Apache “E” variant. The Army will receive 244 remanufactured Apaches while 24 new ones will go to the international customer. “This agreement is great news for our Army, our soldiers, the American taxpayers, our industry partners and numerous international partners,” said U.S. Army Col. Joseph Hoecherl, the Apache project manager. “It is a direct result of the professional dedication and diligent efforts by government and industry teammates to provide the much needed capabilities of the world’s best attack helicopter – the AH-64E Apache – at a fair and affordable price that results in year over year savings to the taxpayer. In the hands of our trained U.S. soldiers, the Apache’s technologies and resulting capabilities are essential to Army operations around the globe.” Boeing builds the Apache in Mesa, Ariz. Deliveries of the “E” model began in October 2011. Seven customers outside the U.S. have ordered this variant. Including this latest version, the U.S. and 15 other countries have relied on the Apache during the past three decades. “The Apache has made a tremendous impact in the defense of the nations that have flown it for the last 37 years,” said Kim Smith, Boeing Attack Helicopters vice president and program manager. “Our team understands the responsibility we have to deliver the best aircraft on time at an affordable price every day, and we are committed to maintaining that well established tradition of excellence.” For more on Defense, Space & Security, visit www.boeing.com.

As he faces confirmation, the executive’s history at Boeing will undoubtedly raise some questions about possible conflicts of interest involving his former employer. Existing close ties between the Trump administration and Boeing, one of the largest US defense contractors, could also muddy the waters. Shanahan, who is currently Boeing’s senior vice president of supply chain and operations, was tapped for deputy defense secretary Thursday along with nominees for five other vacant Pentagon roles under Defense Secretary James Mattis. One is David Joel Trachtenberg, who was was selected as principal deputy undersecretary of defense. Currently CEO of national security consulting company Shortwaver, he previously served as the vice president and head of the strategic analysis division at CACI-National Security Research, a large defense contracting company that specializes in cyber analytics, counter intelligence and other services to disrupt terrorist activities. “These are all highly qualified individuals who were personally recommended by Secretary Mattis to the President for nomination,” Pentagon spokesman Capt. Jeff Davis told CNN. Most of Shanahan’s recent job experience at Boeing lies on the company’s commercial side, where he managed the 737, 747, 767, 777 and 787 airliner programs. But he has also spent time running two of the manufacturing giant’s defense divisions as the vice president and general manager of both Boeing Missile Defense Systems and Rotorcraft Systems. If confirmed by the Senate, Shanahan would have to pledge to recuse himself from issues involving his former employer for two years, according to an executive order pertaining to ethical commitments of executive branch appointees that Trump signed in January. Shanahan will also be expected to divest himself of Boeing-related financial interests before taking the job. Once a target of Trump’s Twitter ire, Boeing has risen to significant influence inside the Trump White House. Earlier this year, Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg told reporters that he has an open dialogue with the President. Trump has met with Muilenburg on several occasions since the election and the two worked together to reduce the cost of a replacement for Air Force One, according to a CNN Money report. The President also used the Boeing-produced F/A-18 Super Hornet fighter jet as leverage against competitor Lockheed Martin in price negotiations for 90 F-35 Joint Strike Fighters earlier this year. Mandy Smithberger, a director at the Washington-based watchdog group Project on Government Oversight, said the F-35 program is a major source of concern for possible conflicts of interest as the Pentagon continues to review ways to cut costs to the country’s most expensive weapons program.

As he faces confirmation, the executive’s history at Boeing will undoubtedly raise some questions about possible conflicts of interest involving his former employer. Existing close ties between the Trump administration and Boeing, one of the largest US defense contractors, could also muddy the waters. Shanahan, who is currently Boeing’s senior vice president of supply chain and operations, was tapped for deputy defense secretary Thursday along with nominees for five other vacant Pentagon roles under Defense Secretary James Mattis. One is David Joel Trachtenberg, who was was selected as principal deputy undersecretary of defense. Currently CEO of national security consulting company Shortwaver, he previously served as the vice president and head of the strategic analysis division at CACI-National Security Research, a large defense contracting company that specializes in cyber analytics, counter intelligence and other services to disrupt terrorist activities. “These are all highly qualified individuals who were personally recommended by Secretary Mattis to the President for nomination,” Pentagon spokesman Capt. Jeff Davis told CNN. Most of Shanahan’s recent job experience at Boeing lies on the company’s commercial side, where he managed the 737, 747, 767, 777 and 787 airliner programs. But he has also spent time running two of the manufacturing giant’s defense divisions as the vice president and general manager of both Boeing Missile Defense Systems and Rotorcraft Systems. If confirmed by the Senate, Shanahan would have to pledge to recuse himself from issues involving his former employer for two years, according to an executive order pertaining to ethical commitments of executive branch appointees that Trump signed in January. Shanahan will also be expected to divest himself of Boeing-related financial interests before taking the job. Once a target of Trump’s Twitter ire, Boeing has risen to significant influence inside the Trump White House. Earlier this year, Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg told reporters that he has an open dialogue with the President. Trump has met with Muilenburg on several occasions since the election and the two worked together to reduce the cost of a replacement for Air Force One, according to a CNN Money report. The President also used the Boeing-produced F/A-18 Super Hornet fighter jet as leverage against competitor Lockheed Martin in price negotiations for 90 F-35 Joint Strike Fighters earlier this year. Mandy Smithberger, a director at the Washington-based watchdog group Project on Government Oversight, said the F-35 program is a major source of concern for possible conflicts of interest as the Pentagon continues to review ways to cut costs to the country’s most expensive weapons program. If the Pentagon decides to make major cuts to the F-35 program in favor of a different aircraft, she said, that would be a situation “where Boeing can benefit substantially.” And while there are federal regulations and ethical codes in place to help prevent blatant conflicts of interest, Smitherberger stressed the importance of public involvement to hold officials accountable.

Home World news White House announces Pentagon deputy pick White House announces Pentagon deputy pick The White House today said President Donald Trump intends to nominate top Boeing executive Patrick Shanahan to become deputy defense secretary. By: AFP | Wasjington | Published: March 17, 2017 4:06 AM Defense Secretary Jim Mattis was Trump’s first cabinet pick to win Senate confirmation but other “political” positions in the Pentagon have gone unfilled. The White House today said President Donald Trump intends to nominate top Boeing executive Patrick Shanahan to become deputy defense secretary. Shanahan is a senior vice president at Boeing, where he is responsible for oversight of the company’s manufacturing operations and supplier management functions, the White House said in statement. Boeing is a major defense contractor and supplies the military with many big-ticket items, including the F/A-18 Super Hornet, Apache helicopter gunships, Chinooks and Air Force One, which currently is in the early phases replacement and which Trump has said is too expensive. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis was Trump’s first cabinet pick to win Senate confirmation but other “political” positions in the Pentagon have gone unfilled. According to US media, the White House and the Pentagon have butted heads on several potential nominees. You may also like to watch: The White House announced five other intended nominees at the same time as Shanahan, and the Pentagon said all are “highly qualified individuals who were personally recommended by Secretary Mattis to the president for nomination.” Shanahan was previously vice president and general manager of Boeing Missile Defense Systems and vice president and general manager for Rotorcraft Systems in Philadelphia. If confirmed by the Senate, Shanahan would replace Robert Work, who has remained in his role in a temporary capacity since Barack Obama left office. Trump’s defense secretary is Jim Mattis, a retired four-star Marine general. Please Wait while comments are loading...

Getty Images Advertisement WASHINGTON—President Donald Trump has tapped top Boeing executive Patrick Shanahan to become deputy defense secretary, the White House said Thursday. Shanahan is a senior vice president at Boeing, where he is responsible for oversight of the company's manufacturing operations and supplier management functions, the White House said in a statement. Boeing is a major defense contractor and supplies the military with many big-ticket items, including the F/A-18 Super Hornet, Apache helicopter gunships, Chinooks and Air Force One, which currently is in the early phases replacement and which Trump has said is too expensive. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, a retired four-star Marine general, was Trump's first cabinet pick to win Senate confirmation but other "political" positions in the Pentagon have gone unfilled.   The White House and the Pentagon have butted heads on several potential nominees.  Popular Now Corporate Social Responsibility in the Supply Chain One of Hotter Hubs for IIoT Development? Israel Achieving Competitive Advantage Through Supply Chain Management The White House announced five other intended nominees at the same time as Shanahan, and the Pentagon said all are "highly qualified individuals who were personally recommended by Secretary Mattis to the president for nomination." Shanahan was previously vice president and general manager of Boeing Missile Defense Systems and vice president and general manager for Rotorcraft Systems in Philadelphia. If confirmed by the Senate, Shanahan would replace Robert Work, who has remained in his role in a temporary capacity since Barack Obama left office. Copyright Agence France-Presse, 2017.

SpaceX defeats Boeing-Lockheed partnership for GPS launch contract Elon Musk's Space Exploration Technologies has won a GPS satellite launch contract over rival United Launch Alliance, a partnership of the top two U.S. aerospace companies Lockheed Martin Corp. and Boeing Co., the U.S. Air Force said on Tuesday. The contract, worth $96.5 million, is the second GPS satellite launch contract awarded by the Air Force to Musk's rocket company, known as SpaceX. United Launch Alliance, however, did not bid for the first GPS launch contract, which was awarded in April 2016. At the time, the Air Force said SpaceX's $83 million bid was about 40 percent less than what the military had been paying United Launch Alliance for previously awarded contracts. Miniature lab begins science experiments in outer space Orbiting the earth at more than 500 kilometers (300 miles), a tiny satellite with a laboratory shrunk to the size of a tissue box is helping scientists carry out experiments that take gravity out of the equation. The technology was launched into space last month by SpacePharma, a Swiss-Israeli company, which on Thursday announced that its first experiments have been completed successfully. When it comes to peacock mating, plumage size matters: study The size and width of a peacock's proud plumage attracts the gaze of males likely sizing up rivals and of females potentially looking for mates, a survey released on Wednesday showed. For the study published in the Journal of Experimental Biology, researchers at Texas A&amp;M University fitted peacocks and peahens with headgear that tracked their eye movements and monitored what the birds were gazing at when they looked at members of their group. Breathe easy: nose shape was influenced by local climate The human nose, in all its glorious forms, is one of our most distinctive characteristics, whether big, little, broad, narrow or somewhere in between. Scientists are now sniffing out some of the factors that drove the evolution of the human proboscis. Researchers said on Thursday a study using three-dimensional images of hundreds of people of East Asian, South Asian, West African and Northern European ancestry indicated local climate, specifically temperature and humidity, played a key role in determining the nose's shape.

(You can see a video of the Starliner parachute test here.) The other is a human-rated version of SpaceX's Dragon spacecraft, which currently ferries cargo to the orbiting laboratory. The parachutes were deployed at 40,000 feet (12 kilometers) —a typical altitude for a commercial airline flight — after being carried aloft by a Near Space Corp. helium balloon. The Starliner dropped from the balloon and took off at speeds of up to 300 mph (480 km/h), according to NASA's statement. [Boeing's CST-100 Space Capsule in Pictures]  A high-altitude balloon carried a test version of Boeing's CST-100 Starliner for a parachute drop test in February 2017. Credit: Boeing To stabilize the spacecraft, two drogue parachutes were deployed at 28,000 feet (8.5 km), according to the statement. The craft's pilot parachutes and main parachutes were subsequently deployed, before the heat shield (meant to protect the craft as it falls from space through Earth's atmosphere) was jettisoned at 4,500 feet (1,370 meters). Then, Starliner touched down "gently" in the desert sand. "This parachute test, as well as the subsequent tests in Boeing's qualification test campaign, provides valuable data, because the test article has the same mass, outer mold line and center of gravity as the flight vehicle," said Mark Biesack, spacecraft systems lead for NASA's Commercial Crew Program, in the statement. "The high-fidelity data they receive from these tests will anchor predicted models of realistic parachute deployment."  A view from the top hatch of Boeing's CST-100 Starliner boilerplate capsule after its parachutes deployed during a February 2017 test. Credit: Boeing For space station missions, Starliner will launch on an Atlas V rocket from Space Launch Complex 41 at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida. At the end of each mission, Starliner will deploy large air bags to soften the blow upon landing. Boeing expects to use each spacecraft up to 10 times, ideally landing on solid ground to preserve reusability. In case of emergency, though, the spacecraft can parachute into the ocean.

George Washington, the Navy's only ... permanently forward-deployed aircraft carrier, is currently underway supporting security and stability in the Western Pacific Ocean. (U.S. Navy photo by Aviation Electrician Technician Airman Josiah Connelly) Expand President Donald Trump has tapped a leading executive from Boeing (BA) to serve in the No. 2 role at the Pentagon, underscoring Trump’s plans to enhance defense spending. Continue Reading Below The White House said Thursday it will nominate Patrick Shanahan, Boeing’s senior vice president of supply chain and operations, for deputy secretary of defense, the top position under Secretary James Mattis. The announcement came the same day as Trump’s budget proposal for fiscal year 2018, which calls for a 10% increase to the Pentagon’s budget. The administration is asking Congress to approve a defense budget of $639 billion, or $54 billion more than the current budget. Shanahan was named to his role with Boeing in April 2016. As head of the aircraft maker’s supply chain and operations, Shanahan is responsible for implementing advanced manufacturing technologies and global supply chain strategies, according to Boeing’s website. Shanahan led the 787 Dreamliner program from 2007 to 2008. Prior to that, he held various executive positions in defense programs. He was vice president and general manager of Boeing Missile Defense Systems, starting in December 2004. Shanahan also oversaw U.S. Army aviation programs for Rotorcraft Systems, a Boeing subsidiary. Continue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT Trump publicly clashed with Boeing and aerospace rival Lockheed Martin (LMT) over the costs of the new Air Force One jets and Lockheed’s F-35. He later met with the CEOs of both Pentagon contractors. Military stocks have soared since Trump became president; Boeing is up 25% since Election Day, while Lockheed Martin is up 12%. It’s not just the Pentagon getting an injection of business acumen. Trump selected former Exxon Mobil (XOM) CEO Rex Tillerson to serve as Secretary of State and billionaire investor Wilbur Ross for Commerce Secretary. Former Goldman Sachs (GS) executives Steve Mnuchin and Gary Cohn are serving as Treasury Secretary and chief economic advisor, respectively.

President Donald Trump has struggled to fill top Defense Department positions. Mattis is the only administration nominee to be confirmed at the Pentagon. Until Thursday, the administration had only announced four other nominees; two of those later withdrew. Trump’s pick for deputy secretary is Patrick M Shanahan. The latest manifestation of Mattis’ struggle came earlier this week when he abandoned an effort to get White House approval for his choice of policy chief, Anne W Patterson, a career diplomat who was opposed by some Senate Republicans. The White House’s nominees list on Thursday didn’t include a new policy chief, but it did name a deputy policy chief. A Pentagon spokesman, Navy Capt Jeff Davis, said Mattis recommended all six of the nominees to the White House. Each requires Senate confirmation.

Work is the only senior Pentagon official from the prior administration still in place, although others have been performing the duties of senior officials in the absence of Trump nominees. Shanahan moved up through the management ranks at Boeing over a career that began in 1986. The Puget Sound Business Journal called him a Boeing “fix-it” man in a March 2016 report on Shanahan’s promotion to his current position. He oversees the company’s global supply chain strategies and use of advanced manufacturing technologies. Shanahan was a central to getting the 787 Dreamliner on track after production problems in the program’s early years, the report said. Boeing’s website says Shanahan is a member of the company’s executive council, reporting directly to the chairman and president, Dennis Mullenburg. Shanahan previously was senior vice president of airplane programs from 2008 to 2016 and vice president and general manager of Boeing Missile Defense Systems.

He holds a bachelor of science degree in mechanical engineering from the University of Washington and two advanced degrees from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. David Joel Trachtenberg, nominated for the No. 2 policy job, is president of Shortwave Consulting, a national security consulting firm. He has held several Pentagon positions, including principal deputy assistant secretary for international security policy responsible for NATO, Europe, Russia and Eurasia issues. He penned a December 2015 commentary saying the Obama administration failed to adapt to a changing reality with Russia following its annexation of Crimea, incursions into eastern Ukraine, and more aggressive military exercises. “Despite Moscow’s clear shift toward a more threatening nuclear posture, US policy remains stuck in the mud of unrealistic and outdated assumptions,” Trachtenberg wrote. Elissa Slotkin, who was acting assistant secretary of defense for international security affairs for the final two years of the Obama administration, said Trachtenberg was a member of Trump’s Pentagon transition team and was viewed as holding mainstream Republic views on national security issues. “We were happy to have him on the transition team because he reflected an experienced foreign policy perspective, in contrast to President Trump,” she said in a telephone interview. The White House said it also intends to nominate: David L. Norquist, a partner with accounting firm Kearney and Co, as budget chief. Elaine McCusker, currently director of resources and analysis at US Central Command headquarters at McDill Air Force Base in Florida, as deputy budget chief. Mattis knows her from his years as commander of Central Command. Robert Daigle as director of Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation, which provides the secretary of defense with independent analysis of major acquisition programs. He served in that office during President George W. Bush’s administration. Kenneth P Rapuano as assistant secretary of defense for homeland defense. He is senior vice president at ANSER Corp., which describes itself as a not-for-profit research institute with emphasis on national security and homeland defense. tags Patrick M Shanahan Pentagon Defense Department Jim Mattis Boeing more from world US Homeland Security seeks proposal to build 30-foot-high wall at Mexican border Mar 18, 2017 22:58 IST UN support for China project passing through PoK puts India’s claim in jeopardy Mar 18, 2017 23:53 IST Wake up before the next question Partnered feature Recommended for you India World Business Education Autos Real estate Opinion Analysis Columns Editorials Blogs Authors Cities Delhi Gurgaon Noida Mumbai Bhopal Chandigarh Dehradun Indore Jaipur Kolkata Lucknow Patna Ranchi Sports Cricket Football Tennis Others Entertainment Movie reviews Bollywood Hollywood Regional movies World cinema TV Music Tabloid Lifestyle Sex & relationship Health & fitness Fashion & trends Art & culture Travel Books Brunch Tech Tech Reviews Gadgets Photos Videos Epaper HT Indepth Punjab Livemint Livehindustan Shine HTcampus Desimartini HTsyndication Follow us on: Newsletter Register with Hindustan Times to get best news and articles Copyright © HT Media Limited All rights reserved.

Among them is a Boeing executive who previously oversaw army aviation and missile defense programs. If confirmed by the Senate, Patrick Shanahan will replace Robert Work as Deputy Secretary of Defense. He most recently managed supply chain and operations at Boeing and was credited with saving the troubled 787 Dreamliner program. He previously managed Boeing’s Missile Defense Systems and Rotorcraft Systems, the division responsible for military transport and combat helicopters such as the V-22 Osprey, the CH-47 Chinook, and the AH-64D Apache. Trump nominates Boeing executive for Pentagon's second-in-command https://t.co/Q0jsFrJlAa— Blogs of War (@BlogsofWar) March 16, 2017 David Joel Trachtenberg was named principal deputy undersecretary for policy, and Kenneth P. Rapuano as assistant secretary for homeland defense and global security, the White House announced on Thursday. Trachtenberg is a former House Armed Services Committee staffer who most recently worked at the Pentagon as principal deputy assistant secretary for international security policy, while Rapuano is a retired Marine who served as White House Deputy Homeland Security Advisor during George W. Bush’s second term. Read more Trump’s budget requests $54 bn defense increase, while slashing other departments Robert Daigle will be the director of Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation (CAPE) at the Department of Defense. He previously worked as a senior director at CAPE during the George W. Bush administration. Experienced accountant David Norquist was appointed to the undersecretary post of comptroller. He was the first Senate-confirmed chief financial officer at the Department of Homeland Security and is credited with cleaning up the department’s finances. Elaine McCusker will serve as Norquist’s principal deputy undersecretary. The former Senate Armed Services Committee staffer currently works at US Central Command in Florida, and previously worked at the US Navy headquarters and at the comptroller’s office at the Pentagon. “These are all highly qualified individuals who were personally recommended by Secretary Mattis to the President,” said Pentagon spokesman Captain Jeff Davis. The appointments appear directly related to Trump’s agenda of rebuilding the military, which allocated $639 billion to the Pentagon in the 2018 federal budget. However, Trump has also been vocal on his plans to get much more value for the dollar, pressuring Lockheed Martin to cut over $700 million from the latest batch of F-35 fighters and even threatening Boeing over the $4 billion price tag for the new Air Force One. Though Trump’s tweets in December sent Boeing’s stock into a tailspin, the president quickly made up with the company, using the Charleston, South Carolina factory in February to deliver a speech in which he promised to “unleash the power of the American spirit and put our great people back to work.” Defense Secretary Mattis withdraws former US Egypt Ambassador Anne Patterson as choice for undersecretary for policy https://t.co/p2dpDza70g— Shibley Telhami (@ShibleyTelhami) March 15, 2017 Mattis reportedly wanted former diplomat Anne Patterson to be his undersecretary for policy, but the White House and several senators vetoed the proposal, the Washington Post reported earlier this week. Senators Tom Cotton (R-Arkansas) and Ted Cruz (R-Texas) were opposed to Patterson because she served as ambassador to Egypt between 2011 and 2013 when the Obama administration backed the Muslim Brotherhood government. Trump has not named the new secretaries for the Army and the Navy after his original picks withdrew from consideration. The Senate has yet to confirm the appointment of former Republican congresswoman Heather Wilson as Air Force secretary.

Patrick Shanahan, 54, a Boeing senior vice president, was nominated to become deputy defense secretary, according to a White House statement Thursday. If confirmed by the Senate, Shanahan would have to recuse himself from Boeing-related issues for two years, under administration policies. Shanahan, an engineer by training, is a rising star at Boeing, reporting directly to Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg. He has 30 years of experience at the company across its key military, space and commercial aviation businesses but made his mark in 2007, when he was assigned to help fix cascading development issues that left the 787 Dreamliner years behind schedule. Chicago-based Boeing — the second-biggest U.S. government contractor, after Lockheed Martin Corp. — has enjoyed a cozy relationship with the Trump administration after an initial rocky start. After Trump unleashed a Twitter salvo in December complaining about potential costs for Boeing’s project to develop a new Air Force One, Muilenburg seized the opportunity to start a dialogue with the newly elected president. The subsequent discussions at New York’s Trump Tower and the president’s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida appear to have paid off. The White House budget proposal unveiled Thursday includes more funding for Boeing’s F/A-18 Super Hornet fighter and Apache helicopters, while preserving funding for the Export-Import bank, which helps finance the planemaker’s international sales. “What this means for Secretary Mattis is that he will have a competent, detail-oriented operator managing the Pentagon on a daily basis,” said Loren Thompson, a defense analyst at the Lexington Institute, a nonprofit that has received funding from companies including Boeing. Shanahan “understands how to make complex operations mesh,” he said. Read about Trump’s $639 billion Defense Department budget proposal Muilenburg in April promoted Shanahan to his current post as senior vice president for supply chain and operations, adding him to the company’s executive council. The two had been friendly rivals as they rose through the ranks of Boeing’s defense business, which Muilenburg ran before becoming CEO in 2015. By gaining Trump’s ear, Muilenburg has won a powerful advocate for Boeing’s long-in-the-tooth F/A-18. The fighter jet will help fill a shortfall for the Air Force while it awaits Lockheed’s delayed F-35s to be certified. “Based on the tremendous cost and cost overruns of the Lockheed Martin F-35, I have asked Boeing to price-out a comparable F-18 Super Hornet!” Trump said in a December tweet. He put Muilenburg in a potentially awkward situation in January by phoning the general who manages the Lockheed program while the Boeing executive was present. Defense Secretary Mattis has asked Deputy Defense Secretary Robert Work — an Obama administration holdover who is staying until his successor is confirmed — to supervise a review that compares the F-35C and the F/A-18 and assess whether improvements could be made to the latter to “provide a competitive, cost effective, fighter aircraft alternative.” Under Trump’s proposed budget outline, the Pentagon would receive a $52.3 billion, or 10 percent, increase for the year that begins Oct. 1. The budget includes $13.5 billion to procure additional aircraft, including $4 billion for Boeing’s F/A-18. “Boeing would thus look to be the major winner in terms of additional orders, followed by Lockheed Martin,” Robert Stallard, a defense analyst with Vertical Research Partners, said in a note to clients. After facing difficulty and delays in filling Pentagon positions, the White House unveiled several defense-related appointments Thursday, including David Norquist, a partner with Kearney and Co., as under secretary of defense, comptroller; and David Joel Trachtenberg, president and CEO officer of Shortwaver Consulting, as principal deputy under secretary of defense for policy. Other defense executives who have made the jump to public service have tended to bend over backward to avoid any appearance of favoritism, said Thompson. “Shanahan will be demanding and detail-oriented,” the Lexington Institute analyst said. “But the moment he takes the job, he will cease being Boeing.” (c) 2017, Bloomberg · Julie Johnsson, Nafeesa Syeed Facebook Comment SHARE Facebook Twitter tweet Previous articleWATCH: Newly declassified films show US nuclear tests Next articleCAUGHT ON CAMERA: Fiery explosion after Uber driver crashes into gas pump ---- Follow Us 176,906FansLike 180,873FollowersFollow 815SubscribersSubscribe Breaking Lawyer For Jose Gonzalez, FDNY EMT Yadira Arroyo’s Killer, Gets Interrupted...

[Associated Press] WASHINGTON — The White House announced nominees for six senior Pentagon jobs on Thursday, including longtime Boeing Co. executive Patrick M. Shanahan for deputy secretary of defense, in its most significant step toward surrounding Defense Secretary Jim Mattis with Trump administration picks. Related News/Archive For Trump, a solitary start to life in the White House 1 Month Ago White House aides defend Trump's wiretapping claim 2 Weeks Ago Trump greets Irish prime minister at White House 2 Days Ago Also, Elaine McCusker, director of resources and analysis at U.S. Central Command headquarters at MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa, is expected to be nominated as deputy budget chief. Mattis knows her from his years as commander of CentCom. President Donald Trump has struggled to fill top Defense Department positions. Mattis is the only administration nominee to be confirmed at the Pentagon. Until Thursday, the administration had only announced four other nominees; two of those later withdrew. Trump's pick for deputy secretary is Patrick M. Shanahan. The latest manifestation of Mattis' struggle came earlier this week when he abandoned an effort to get White House approval for his choice of policy chief, Anne W. Patterson, a career diplomat who was opposed by some Senate Republicans. The White House's nominees list Thursday didn't include a new policy chief, but it did name a deputy policy chief. A Pentagon spokesman, Navy Capt. Jeff Davis, said Mattis recommended all six of the nominees to the White House. Each requires Senate confirmation. As deputy secretary of defense, Shanahan would succeed Robert Work, a former Marine and Obama administration holdover. Work is the only senior Pentagon official from the prior administration still in place, although others have been performing the duties of senior officials in the absence of Trump nominees. Shanahan moved up through the management ranks at Boeing over a career that began in 1986. The Puget Sound Business Journal called him a Boeing "fix-it" man in a March 2016 report on Shanahan's promotion to his current position. He oversees the company's global supply chain strategies and use of advanced manufacturing technologies. Shanahan was a central to getting the 787 Dreamliner on track after production problems in the program's early years, the report said. Boeing's website says Shanahan is a member of the company's executive council, reporting directly to the chairman and president, Dennis Mullenburg. Shanahan previously was senior vice president of airplane programs from 2008 to 2016 and vice president and general manager of Boeing Missile Defense Systems. A Washington state native, Shanahan is currently chairman of the University of Washington's Board of Regents. He holds a bachelor of science degree in mechanical engineering from the University of Washington and two advanced degrees from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. David Joel Trachtenberg, nominated for the No. 2 policy job, is president of Shortwave Consulting, a national security consulting firm. He has held several Pentagon positions, including principal deputy assistant secretary for international security policy responsible for NATO, Europe, Russia and Eurasia issues. He penned a December 2015 commentary saying the Obama administration failed to adapt to a changing reality with Russia following its annexation of Crimea, incursions into eastern Ukraine, and more aggressive military exercises. "Despite Moscow's clear shift toward a more threatening nuclear posture, U.S. policy remains stuck in the mud of unrealistic and outdated assumptions," Trachtenberg wrote. Elissa Slotkin, who was acting assistant secretary of defense for international security affairs for the final two years of the Obama administration, said Trachtenberg was a member of Trump's Pentagon transition team and was viewed as holding mainstream Republic views on national security issues. "We were happy to have him on the transition team because he reflected an experienced foreign policy perspective, in contrast to President Trump," she said in a telephone interview. The White House said it also intends to nominate: • David L. Norquist, a partner with accounting firm Kearney and Co., as budget chief. • Robert Daigle as director of Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation, which provides the secretary of defense with independent analysis of major acquisition programs. He served in that office during President George W. Bush's administration. • Kenneth P. Rapuano as assistant secretary of defense for homeland defense. He is senior vice president at ANSER Corp., which describes itself as a not-for-profit research institute with emphasis on national security and homeland defense.

(REUTERS/Robert Sorbo) Enlarge Caption  Email More A A WASHINGTON: President Donald Trump has tapped top Boeing executive Patrick Shanahan to become deputy defence secretary, the White House said on Thursday (Mar 16). Shanahan is a senior vice president at Boeing, where he is responsible for oversight of the company's manufacturing operations and supplier management functions, the White House said in a statement. Boeing is a major defence contractor and supplies the military with many big-ticket items, including the F/A-18 Super Hornet, Apache helicopter gunships, Chinooks and Air Force One, which currently is in the early phases replacement and which Trump has said is too expensive. Defence Secretary Jim Mattis, a retired four-star Marine general, was Trump's first cabinet pick to win Senate confirmation but other "political" positions in the Pentagon have gone unfilled. According to US media, the White House and the Pentagon have butted heads on several potential nominees. The White House announced five other intended nominees at the same time as Shanahan, and the Pentagon said all are "highly qualified individuals who were personally recommended by Secretary Mattis to the president for nomination." Shanahan was previously vice president and general manager of Boeing Missile Defence Systems and vice president and general manager for Rotorcraft Systems in Philadelphia. If confirmed by the Senate, Shanahan would replace Robert Work, who has remained in his role in a temporary capacity since Barack Obama left office. - AFP/de Email More YOU MAY ALSO LIKE From Our Website From the Web Happening Now new window view more My Facebook Friends Back To Top JUMP TO Select Section Asia Pacific Singapore World Business Sport Entertainment Technology Health Lifestyle Videos Weather Photos Special Reports Archives Services PSI Navigate to: News TV Connect Watch Live GET OUR APPS iPhone/iPad Android Get Our News Facebook Twitter Linkedin YouTube Mobile SMS eNews RSS News Asia Pacific World Sport Technology Lifestyle Photos Archives Singapore Business Entertainment Health Videos Special Reports TV Live News Schedule Shows Services Weather ADVERTISE WITH US Online Mobile TV Contact Sales Channel NewsAsia Channel News Asia About Us Coverage Hotel Partners Events & Seminars Presenters & Correspondents Contact Us Mediacorp Mediacorp News Group © 2017 About Mediacorp Pte Ltd Terms and Conditions Privacy Policy Back To Top

(Pierre Verdy/Agence France-Presse via Getty Images) President Trump has nominated six individuals to fill some of the highest posts at the Pentagon, including a Boeing executive who will serve as the department’s second-in-command, according to a news release put out Thursday by the White House. Aside from the deputy secretary of defense, the new appointees would take posts that have been unoccupied since Trump took office. Robert Work, the current deputy secretary of defense, agreed to stay in his role following the inauguration until his replacement was nominated. “These are all highly qualified individuals who were personally recommended by Secretary Mattis to the President for nomination, said Pentagon spokesman Navy Capt. Jeff Davis in a statement. “Secretary Mattis is grateful to Deputy Secretary Bob Work for agreeing to continue serving until his successor is confirmed. His steady leadership is critical during this time of transition, and Secretary Mattis continues to have full confidence in him as he carries out crucial work in managing in the Department.” Work’s successor, if confirmed by the Senate, will be Patrick Shanahan, the senior vice president of supply chain operations for Boeing. While Shanahan’s recent posting at the aeronautics giant was on the commercial side, overseeing programs such as the 737 and 747 airliners, he also did stints as vice president and general manger of Boeing Missile Defense Systems and the company’s military rotorcraft division in Philadelphia. Trump has met multiple times with Boeing executives since he was elected, leaning on the company to reduce the cost of the replacement for Air Force One and also as leverage to the same for Lockheed Martin’s massive F-35 program. In February, Trump held a rally at the Boeing plant in South Carolina where he ended his speech with “God Bless Boeing.” While Shanahan’s time in the company might highlight Trump’s propensity to lean on the revolving door of the defense industry and the U.S. military, former president Barack Obama’s first pick for deputy secretary of defense, William Lynn, was a lobbyist for the defense giant Raytheon before taking the role in 2009. For principal deputy undersecretary of defense for policy, Trump has nominated David Joel Trachtenberg, according to the news release. He is president and chief executive of Shortwaver Consulting and a former House Armed Services Committee staffer. Trachtenberg’s boss, the deputy undersecretary of defense for policy, has yet to be nominated. In recent days, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis withdrew his recommendation — senior diplomat Anne W. Patterson — after friction from some within the Trump administration. David Norquist has been picked to serve as the Pentagon’s comptroller. He is a partner with the accounting firm Kearney and Co. and served as the first chief financial officer for the Department of Homeland Security. Elaine McCusker would serve under Norquist. She is the current director of resources and analysis at the U.S. Central Command based out of Tampa. She has served on the Senate Armed Services Committee as a professional staffer, in the Department of the Navy and in the Pentagon’s comptroller office. Kenneth Rapuano, a former Marine and Pentagon civilian, will be the assistant secretary of defense for homeland defense and global security. He is the senior vice president and director of the studies and analysis group at ANSER Corp. Rapuano is also a former White House deputy homeland security adviser. Robert Daigle will helm the Pentagon’s Office of Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation, a branch of the department that oversees and studies various Pentagon initiatives. Daigle worked at the office under George W. Bush’s administration. world national-security checkpoint Get 2016 Olympics updates by email Our best news and analysis from Rio, delivered to your inbox. post_newsletter333 magnet-olympics2016 false after3th false Please provide a valid email address.

The White House announced nominees for six senior Pentagon jobs on Thursday, March 16, 2017, including Shanahan for deputy secretary of defense, in its most significant step toward surrounding Defense Secretary Jim Mattis with Trump administration picks. (AP Photo/Ted S. Warren, File) WASHINGTON (AP) — The White House announced nominees for six senior Pentagon jobs on Thursday, including a longtime Boeing Co. executive for deputy secretary of defense, moving to fill out Defense Secretary Jim Mattis' new team. President Donald Trump has struggled to fill top Defense Department positions. Mattis is the only administration nominee to be confirmed at the Pentagon. Until Thursday, the administration had only announced four other nominees; two of those later withdrew. Trump's pick for deputy secretary is Patrick M. Shanahan. The latest manifestation of Mattis' struggle came earlier this week when he abandoned an effort to get White House approval for his choice of policy chief, Anne W. Patterson, a career diplomat who was opposed by some Senate Republicans. The White House's nominees list Thursday didn't include a new policy chief, but it did name a deputy policy chief. A Pentagon spokesman, Navy Capt. Jeff Davis, said Mattis recommended all six of the nominees to the White House. Each requires Senate confirmation. As deputy secretary of defense, Shanahan would succeed Robert Work, a former Marine and Obama administration holdover. Work is the only senior Pentagon official from the prior administration still in place, although others have been performing the duties of senior officials in the absence of Trump nominees. Shanahan moved up through the management ranks at Boeing over a career that began in 1986. The Puget Sound Business Journal called him a Boeing "fix-it" man in a March 2016 report on Shanahan's promotion to his current position. He oversees the company's global supply chain strategies and use of advanced manufacturing technologies. Shanahan was a central to getting the 787 Dreamliner on track after production problems in the program's early years, the report said. Boeing's website says Shanahan is a member of the company's executive council, reporting directly to the chairman and president, Dennis Mullenburg. Shanahan previously was senior vice president of airplane programs from 2008 to 2016 and vice president and general manager of Boeing Missile Defense Systems. A Washington state native, Shanahan is currently chairman of the University of Washington's Board of Regents. He holds a bachelor of science degree in mechanical engineering from the University of Washington and two advanced degrees from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. David Joel Trachtenberg, nominated for the No. 2 policy job, is president of Shortwave Consulting, a national security consulting firm. He has held several Pentagon positions, including principal deputy assistant secretary for international security policy responsible for NATO, Europe, Russia and Eurasia issues. He penned a December 2015 commentary saying the Obama administration failed to adapt to a changing reality with Russia following its annexation of Crimea, incursions into eastern Ukraine, and more aggressive military exercises. "Despite Moscow's clear shift toward a more threatening nuclear posture, U.S. policy remains stuck in the mud of unrealistic and outdated assumptions," Trachtenberg wrote. Elissa Slotkin, who was acting assistant secretary of defense for international security affairs for the final two years of the Obama administration, said Trachtenberg was a member of Trump's Pentagon transition team and was viewed as holding mainstream Republic views on national security issues.

"We were happy to have him on the transition team because he reflected an experienced foreign policy perspective, in contrast to President Trump," she said in a telephone interview. The White House said it also intends to nominate: —David L. Norquist, a partner with accounting firm Kearney and Co., as budget chief. —Elaine McCusker, currently director of resources and analysis at U.S. Central Command headquarters at McDill Air Force Base in Florida, as deputy budget chief. Mattis knows her from his years as commander of Central Command. —Robert Daigle as director of Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation, which provides the secretary of defense with independent analysis of major acquisition programs. He served in that office during President George W. Bush's administration. —Kenneth P. Rapuano as assistant secretary of defense for homeland defense. He is senior vice president at ANSER Corp., which describes itself as a not-for-profit research institute with emphasis on national security and homeland defense. Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.

News Air Force Will Seek Proposals For Low-Cost Attack Plane Experiment Textron could offer up its AirLand Scorpion in the Air Force's upcoming experiment, after dropping the plane out of the running for the Air Force's T-X trainer plane contract. (Textron AirLand) GILLIAN RICH 3/16/2017 Reprints ARLINGTON, Va. — The Air Force will formally seek proposals Friday for aircraft that would fly in a low-cost attack plane experiment, with Texton (TXT,) Northrop Grumman (NOC), Boeing (BA) and Embraer (ERJ) seen as potential participants. Responses from industry are expected within a month, with the selected aircraft flying in tests this summer at Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico, said Lt. Gen. Arnold Bunch, military deputy in Air Force acquisition, at an Air Force Association breakfast Thursday. The Pentagon has debated the idea for a light-attack aircraft for some time and even deployed Vietnam-era propeller-driven planes to Iraq in 2015 to see how they performed against the Islamic State, which lack sophisticated air defenses. The idea is to reduce wear and tear on more advanced fighters and cut operating expenses. Aircraft like Lockheed's F-35 and Boeing's F/A-18 Super Hornet would still form the backbone of the U.S. fighter fleet for missions in so-called contested environments and against sophisticated planes from China and Russia. "We want to look at a concept to see if we can have a lower operating cost, a lower unit cost and for something that would be able to operate in a permissive or more permissive environment than what I would require a fourth- or fifth-gen aircraft to operate in," Bunch said. Textron could submit its AirLand Scorpion, after dropping the plane out of the running for the Air Force's T-X trainer plane contest, or its Beechcraft AT-6 aircraft. After also dropping out of the T-X program, Northrop could propose the plane once envisioned for that contract, according to Mark Bobbi, an aerospace, defense and security analyst at consultancy IHS. Meanwhile, Boeing and Saab could submit their joint T-X proposal, and Brazil's Embraer could submit its A-29 Super Tucano. "No one who has developed a trainer in the last 40 years has done it solely for the trainer market," Bobbi said, noting the Pilatus of Switzerland as one exception. Northrop shares fell 1.5% to 240.28 on the stock market today. Boeing dipped 0.3% to 178.19. Embraer's U.S.-listed shares climbed 1.4% to 243.96. Textron fell 0.4% to 47.65. In announcing plans for the experiment, acting Air Force Secretary Lisa Disbrow said earlier this month the Air Force needs to "explore off-the-shelf technologies" to curb costs as the service faces budget and workforce constraints. The price tag for buying the Super Tucano, for example, would be more than $10 million, or about a tenth the current cost of Lockheed's F-35. Operating the Super Tucano would only cost a few thousand dollars per hour vs. $19,000 per hour for Lockheed's F-16 and $44,000 for the F-35A variant, according to Air Force data cited by the Washington Post. Bunch stressed Thursday that what is now designated as the OA-X experiment is not an official acquisition program and could be scrapped if submissions aren't as mature as the Air Force wants. And even if the Pentagon did decide to buy new, low-cost attack planes, they wouldn't come at the expense of modernization efforts for fifth-generation fighters. "Moving in this direction would be additive for what the Air force has for dollars and manpower for today," Bunch said. Potentially tripping up the Air Force's efforts is the Army's program to replace its helicopters, including Boeing Apaches, which could be sped up to fly in the mid to late-2020s from the current plan for 2030, said IHS analyst Bobbi. "If the Army accelerates (the Future Vertical Lift program), the whole argument for the fixed-wing light strike goes away," he told IBD. "That's the wild card in the game."

 The nastiest feud in the airline business seems tailor-made for Trump — but he won't touch it Benjamin Zhang Mar. 16, 2017, 1:10 PM 21,548 facebook linkedin twitter email print President Donald Trump with the Boeing 787-9. REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque The largest US airlines want the White House to intervene in the expansion of three huge Middle Eastern rivals, which they say is hurting business and jobs. Trump hasn't taken up the cause. The Middle Eastern carriers — Emirates, Etihad, and Qatar — are big customers of Boeing's. Trump's family business also has strong ties and ambitions in the United Arab Emirates and Qatar. America's airline workers and CEOs are mad as hell. They face increasing competition from a group of foreign rivals that they say are government-supported, profiting off cheap labor, and abusing international agreements. On the surface, it seems like a perfect opportunity for President Donald Trump to champion American workers and threaten to tear up another trade agreement, but so far he's not biting. There are two reasons for this. His focus on job creation is in manufacturing, not the services industry, and the airlines that are triggering the complaints hail from a part of the world where Trump has growing business ties. What's the issue? Here's the shorthand version of the feud: Since 2015, American, Delta, and United Airlines (the US3) have been complaining about competition from three huge and fast-growing Middle East-based rivals — Emirates, Etihad, and Qatar Airways (the ME3). According to the US3, the ME3's growth has been fueled by as much as $50 billion in subsidies over the past decade, allowing them to flood the international market and threaten the job security of US aviation workers. They also say the ME3 are in violation of the Open Skies agreements that govern air travel between the US and 120 nations including the UAE and Qatar. They're trying hard to get Trump's attention. Last Sunday, a group of United Airlines employees, unions, and members of Congress held a protest at Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey in reaction to the launch of a new daily service by Emirates from Newark to Athens, Greece — a route that United flies during the summer. At the same time, a bipartisan group of 25 members of Congress from New York and New Jersey asked the White to block Emirates' Newark-Athens route. "It's crystal clear that the US airlines and their employees are looking to President Trump to enforce our international agreements with the trade cheaters of the UAE and Qatar," said Jill Zuckman, a spokeswoman for the lobbying group representing the US3 on this matter. The ME3, as you might expect, rebut all this. They say US airlines have been bailed out and supported by government spending in the past, and that their own flights into the US create jobs and growth. Manufacturing First Trump at the Boeing plant in North Charleston, South Carolina. REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque From his early days on the campaign trail, Trump keyed in on a need for America to rebuild its once booming manufacturing sector. Time and time again, candidate Trump and then President Trump vowed to support American-made products. The president has personally praised companies such as Ford, General Motors, United Technologies, and Intel for deciding to keep manufacturing operations in the US. That extends to Boeing. In February, when asked about US airlines' request to block the entrance of Norwegian Air's Irish subsidiary into the domestic market, White House press secretary Sean Spicer said: "They're flying Boeing planes. There is a huge economic interest that America has in that deal right now. I don't want to get ahead of the president on that. But just to be clear, I mean, when you're talking about US jobs — both in terms of the people who are serving those planes and the person who's building those planes — that's a very big difference." The difference here is that Boeing and its assembly plants in Washington state and South Carolina that produced the 120 737 and 787 jets in Norwegian's Boeing-only fleet are the same plants that will build the 100 next-generation 737 MAX airliners Norwegian has on order with a list value of more than $11 billion. After all, there are few visuals quite as representative of American industrial might as a shiny new Boeing jet. The ME3 are big spenders But Norwegian is small potatoes when compared with the economic might and sheer spending power of the ME3. Emirates' Boeing 777-300ER. Boeing Take Emirates, for instance: The airline is one of Boeing's most important and reliable customers. Emirates' fleet of 160 Boeing 777s is the largest of its kind in the world and worth $45 billion. To put things into perspective, if a 737 is the aeronautical equivalent of a $25,000 family sedan, then a 777 is a $100,000 Cadillac Escalade. And Emirates has been buying these "Cadillacs" in bulk, with orders for another $86 billion worth of Boeing 777 and next generation 777X airliners. It's not just Emirates. Collectively, the ME3 account for nearly 80% of the 306 777X aircraft Boeing has sold. Then there are the engines, which Boeing does not make. For Emirates, a larger number of its 777s are powered by General Electric GE90 engines. In 2015, Emirates signed a $16 billion deal with GE to provide maintenance for these engines. Even many of the non-American aircraft Emirates, Etihad, and Qatar fly are powered by American-made engines, built by a Connecticut-based joint venture between GE and Pratt & Whitney, called Engine Alliance. Put it all together, and the three airlines hold more than $150 billion worth of economic power that will keep Boeing's assembly lines rolling for the next decade and beyond. Despite the vastness and importance of the airline industry, the Trump administration's focus on manufacturing, that shining image of US industrial supremacy, takes precedence. After all, why antagonize some of the most lucrative customers for America's most recognizable industrial export? Trump Dubai It's also worth raising the issue of the Trump Organization's business interests in the United Arab Emirates. These business dealings have been the subject of criticism from the president's detractors. In February, the president's two adult sons, Eric and Donald Jr., presided over the opening of the latest Trump-branded golf course, the Trump International Golf Club Dubai. The course, located a stone's throw away from downtown Dubai, was developed by Hussain Sajwani, a billionaire and Trump family friend, and his Dubai-based DAMAC Properties. According to Reuters, DAMAC pays the Trump Organization a licensing fee to use the Trump brand on the facility, which features a 30,000-square-foot clubhouse, four restaurants, state-of-the-art recreation facilities, and a 7,300-yard, par-71 golf course designed by Gil Hanse. DAMAC is also developing a second Trump-branded golf course in the emirate, called the Trump World Golf Club Dubai, which will feature an 18-hole championship course designed by Tiger Woods. In 2015 and 2016, DAMAC paid the Trump Organization as much as $10 million, Bloomberg reported. Eric Trump at the opening of the Trump International Golf Club Dubai. REUTERS/William Maclean The tiny emirate of Dubai has blossomed over the past couple of decades under the guidance of its ruler, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al Maktoum, and revolves around its government, ruled by the house of al Maktoum. Infrastructure, land, and real-estate development are all part of the ruling family's efforts to brand Dubai as a global hub for trade and commerce, and the heart of this international marketing effort is Dubai's most recognizable and effective branding tool: Emirates, and its shining fleet of jumbo jets. It's not just Dubai either. Neighboring Abu Dhabi, where Etihad is based, and Qatar to the north are doing much of the same — including building hotels and golf courses that might carry the Trump name. According to Hotelier Middle East, in 2015, Ivanka Trump said the organization was looking at "multiple opportunities" in Abu Dhabi, Qatar, and Saudi Arabia. On a practical level, Emirates is also the how the world's golfers will find their way to Trump's Dubai properties. And according to a passenger on the flight, it's how Eric and Donald Jr. made their way back to New York from Dubai. It's still early, and it's entirely possible the White House could take up the concerns raised by American, Delta, and United. If it doesn't, we have a good idea why.

Patrick Shanahan, Boeing's senior vice president for supply chain and operations, was nominated to become deputy defense secretary, according to a White House statement Thursday. Shanahan would serve as the deputy to Defense Secretary James Mattis, a retired Marine general, if confirmed by the Senate. He'd also have to pledge to recuse himself from issues involving Boeing for two years, according to Trump administration policies.

He made his mark improving the 787 Dreamliner program as supplier and design issues ballooned in 2007, and then helping apply some of those lessons learned as a senior vice president in charge of Boeing's commercial airplane programs.

The budget includes $13.5 billion to procure additional aircraft, including $4 billion for Boeing's F/A-18. "Boeing would thus look to be the major winner in terms of additional orders, followed by Lockheed Martin," Robert Stallard, a defense analyst with Vertical Research Partners, said in a note to clients. ​ ...

Shanahan is the vice president of Boeing, and joins five other nominees for Pentagon posts announced by the White House today. In his time with Boeing, Shanahan has served as the senior VP of airplane programs, overseeing the 737, 747, 767, 777 and 787 programs. Trending Homeland Security Chief John Kelly Has Cozy Meeting With Democrat Congressmen streiff He has been the senior VP for supply chain and operations since April 2016, handling manufacturing and supplier management. He’s also been the vice president and general manager of Boeing Missile Defense Systems, and before that, the vice president and general manager for Boeing Rotorcraft Systems in Philadelphia. In that role, he was responsible for U.S. Army Aviation programs and site activities in Philadelphia and Mesa, Ariz., where there are facilities for the Bell-Boeing V-22 Osprey tiltrotor, the CH-47 Chinook and the AH-64D Apache attack helicopter. President Trump, who has previously owned stock in Boeing, claimed the costs of the companies Air Force One program (two new 747s) was out of control. After a meeting with the CEO, however, Trump claims to have cut the costs to the program. Defense Secretary James Mattis ordered a review of Air Force One program back in January, in an attempt to pinpoint savings, where possible. At that time, an Obama appointee, Bob Work, was in the deputy Defense secretary role, so it’s unknown whether Shanahan will have to recuse himself, in the event that review is still ongoing.

Boeing also gave $1 million to the president’s inauguration.

The deal facilitates full-rate production for new and existing AH-64E aircraft. Tasks include building new helicopters and crew trainers, ground support equipment, initial spares, integrated logistics support and engineering services. According to the U.S. Department of Defense, the work will be performed at Boeing's facility in Mesa, Ariz., and is expected to be complete by the end of June 2022. The company received all procurement funding at the time of the modification award. The operation will be overseen by the U.S. Army Contracting Command. The AH-64 Apache is a multirole combat helicopter used by the U.S. Army and various other armed forces around the world. The Army first received the platform in January 1984. In addition to Saudi Arabia and the United States, other operators include armed forces in Egypt, Greece, Israel, Japan, South Korea and Britain.

The White House gave no explanation as to why Trump has tapped Patrick Shanahan, Boeing's senior vice president in charge of supply chain and operations, for the top Pentagon position at a time when the U.S. is grappling with global security challenges. Other positions Shanahan served in at Boeing include senior vice president of airplane programs at Boeing Commercial Airplanes where he oversaw the management of profit and loss for the 737, 747, 767, 777 and 787 programs. He also served as vice president and general manager of Boeing Missile Defense Systems and vice president and general manager for Rotorcraft Systems in Philadelphia, where he was responsible for all U.S. Army Aviation, including the Bell-Boeing V-22 Osprey tiltrotor, the CH-47 Chinook and the AH-64D Apache attack helicopter, the White House said. Shanahan graduated from the University of Washington and earned a master's degree from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and an MBA from MIT's Sloan School of Management, it said. jschang@yna.co.kr (END) Most Viewed Seoul to ban smoking at cultural asset sites (4th LD) Park apologizes over alleged sexual misconduct by ex-spokesman Ssangyong says resumption of overnight shift turning point of normalization (2nd LD) N.

Flybondi Related Media Photo Gallery: This Week in Aviation News-March 13-17, 2017 Advertisement Argentine ultra-low-cost carrier (ULCC) startup Flybondi has selected the Boeing 737-800 as its launch aircraft and is ready to begin negotiations for up to 50 737 MAX 200s. Giving a March 15 update, Flybondi said it had chosen the 737-800 over the Airbus A320 and honed its launch schedule to September. The startup had previously announced a start date in the second half of 2017. “We are convinced the Boeing 737-800 is the right aircraft to develop the ULCC model in Argentina and are very pleased with the level of support that Boeing has provided us with,” Flybondi CEO Julian Cook said.  The 737-800s, configured with 189 seats, were selected for their low operating cost. Flybondi also finalized the details of an entry into service support agreement with Boeing. No numbers were specified for the 737-800 acquisition, but Flybondi previously announced plans to operate four aircraft this year, adding six every year after that, to hit 30 aircraft by year five. Cook also said Flybondi will start negotiations for an order of up to 50 Boeing 737 MAX 200s very soon. Buenos Aires-based Flybondi initially revealed plans Sept. 30, 2016, and was granted rights on 41 domestic and 36 regional/international routes in February. The airline will launch with an initial focus on domestic routes and aims to carry 8 million passengers by its fifth year. Flybondi attracted seed funding from a series of well-known industry veterans, including Ryanair board member and ex-COO Michael Cawley, ex-Air Canada CEO Montie Brewer and British Airways CityFlyer Express founder/ex-chairman Robert Wright, alongside a group of Argentinian investors. Argentine entrepreneur Gaston Parisier is behind the project alongside Cook, the founder and former CEO of Swiss regional airline Flybaboo. Former WizzAir CFO Mike Powell will be Flybondi’s interim CFO. Victoria Moores victoria.moores@penton.com Print reprints Favorite EMAIL Tweet Please Log In or Register to post comments.

Trump announced Patrick Shanahan’s nomination to be deputy Defense secretary, along with nominations for five other Pentagon roles, beginning to fill offices that have sat empty since his inauguration. Shanahan has been Boeing’s senior vice president for supply chain and operations since April. In that role, he’s responsible for the company’s manufacturing operations and supplier management functions. Prior to that, he was the senior vice president of airplane programs at Boeing Commercial Airplanes, where he oversaw the 737, 747, 767, 777 and 787 programs. ADVERTISEMENT He’s also been the vice president and general manager of Boeing Missile Defense Systems, and before that, the vice president and general manager for Boeing Rotorcraft Systems in Philadelphia. In that role, he was responsible for U.S. Army Aviation programs and site activities in Philadelphia and Mesa, Ariz., where there are facilities for the Bell-Boeing V-22 Osprey tiltrotor, the CH-47 Chinook and the AH-64D Apache attack helicopter. Shanahan will take over the deputy post from Bob Work, who served in the Obama administration and has stayed on in an interim role until his replacement could be put in place. Trump was critical of Boeing during the transition, saying costs for the replacement Air Force One program — two new 747s — were “out of control.” But Trump’s tune appeared to change after meetings with the CEO of Boeing, and Trump has claimed he’s cut costs on the Air Force One program. Defense Secretary James Mattis ordered Work to conduct a review of the Air Force One program in January to identify potential savings. It’s unclear at what stage the review is in and whether Shanahan would need to recuse himself should the review be ongoing when he takes office. Trump previously owned stock in Boeing. A spokesman said in December that he’d sold it but offered no proof.  Trump on Thursday also nominated David Joel Trachtenberg to be principal deputy under secretary of Defense for policy. Trachtenberg is the president and CEO of Shortwaver Consulting, a national security consultancy. He was formerly principal deputy assistant secretary of Defense for international security policy and a staff member with the House Armed Services Committee. The job of Trachtenberg’s potential boss, undersecretary of defense for policy, remains unfilled. The slot, the No. 3 position at the Pentagon, has reportedly been a point of conflict between the White House and Mattis, with the defense chief withdrawing his choice amid opposition from the administration and Republican senators. Other nominations announced Thursday include: – Robert Daigle as director of Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation (CAPE). Daigle previously served in CAPE during the George W. Bush administration as Director of Program Resources and Information Systems Management Division. He’s currently a staff member on the House Armed Services Committee. – Elaine McCusker as principal deputy under secretary of Defense, comptroller. McCusker is the director of resources and analysis at U.S. Central Command. Prior to that, she was a staff member on the Senate Armed Services Committee, the Department of Navy Headquarters and the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller). – David Norquist as under secretary of Defense, comptroller. He previously held the job from 2006 to 2008. Right now, Norquist is a partner at accounting firm Kearney and Company. He’s also been a staffer on the House Appropriations defense subcommittee and chief financial officer for the Department of Homeland Security. – Kenneth P. Rapuano as assistant secretary of Defense, Homeland Defense and Global Security. Rapuano is currently serves as senior vice president and director of the Studies and Analysis Group at the ANSER Corporation. He was White House Deputy Homeland Security Advisor from 2004 to 2006 and has served in roles with the departments of Energy and Defense. - Updated at 12:16 p.m.   View the discussion thread.

By Alistair Charlton Updated March 16, 2017 16:55 GMT A satellite launching in April 2017 will bring high-speed internet to transatlantic flightsReuters Over half of airline passengers would rather have Wi-Fi access on their next flight than a meal, a survey by Gfk and satellite company Inmarsat found in 2016, while getting online in the sky is something 92% of passengers now want from every flight they take. So far, however, airlines have been slow to act on growing passenger demand for the ability to work, write, stream and tweet from the air. And while some US airlines offer Wi-Fi on internal flights, we Europeans have mostly been left out in the cold. As home and mobile broadband speeds pass new megabit milestones on a regular basis, the Eurostar has a solid 4G connection under the Channel and even London's century-old Tube network has Wi-Fi at most stations, airplanes and cruise ships are stuck in the slow lane or disconnected entirely. Soon this could all change, however, with the launch of the ViaSat-2 satellite in April 2017. Built by Being Satellite Systems in Los Angeles, the 6.7-tonne payload will go into service before the end of the year, beaming high-speed internet from 22,000 miles above the equator to North America, the Caribbean and parts of South America. Importantly for us, it will also team up with France-based Eutelsat to create a bridge across the Atlantic and into Europe. The '4G moment' for mile-high Wi-Fi Giving mid-air Wi-Fi its '4G moment', ViaSat-2 will more than double the bandwidth already beamed across the US by ViaSat-1, from 12 megabits per second (Mbps) per passenger device to 25 Mbps, faster than many copper line broadband connections and closing in on some of the UK's fibre services. Similar speeds will also be accessible from cruise ships and to ViaSat's residential customers in the US. "This is a big deal for us and a big deal for anyone who uses satellite internet," ViaSat chief executive Mark Dankberg tells IBTimes UK. "We've been on a campaign for quite a while now to bring really good broadband via satellite." Rendering provided by ViaSat shows approximately what its second-generation satellite will look likeViaSat IBTimes UK has come to Boeing Satellite Systems next to Los Angeles International airport to see ViaSat-2 just a few weeks before it launches into space. Although photographs of the satellite (and the entire facility) are completely forbidden, we are invited to speak with Dankberk and Paul Rusnock, vice president of Boeing's satellite systems division. ViaSat has been on a mission to bring fast and affordable satellite internet to consumers since construction of ViaSat-1 began in 2008, at a time when satellite communications were considered slow and nothing more than a last resort for stranded adventurers and their chunky sat-phones. That first satellite began beaming the internet back down to Earth in 2012 and immediately upped bandwidth 15-fold. Residential customers who were once stumping up $50 (£41) a month for a measly 1Mbps connection now receive 15Mbps for the same price, and airline passengers can hook up to a steady 12Mbps for the duration of their flight. Apart from capping video quality to that of DVD, there are no streaming restrictions with connections to ViaSat-1, which means as IBTimes UK takes off on a JetBlue flight from Long Beach to San Francisco we can log into Netflix on a laptop while checking our emails on a smartphone as if we were at home. Even as we fly through a storm which later cut the power to thousands of LA homes our mile-high browsing is unaffected. Called Fli-Fi, the internet on JetBlue flights is free in every cabin class and passengers can connect multiple devices without restriction - ViaSat says some flights with 140 seats have had over 200 devices connected at once, such is its stability and popularity. Based next time Los Angeles International, Boeing Satellite Systems built ViaSat-2IBTimes UK A golden ticket for both passengers and airlines For us Europeans who have rarely, if ever, had the opportunity to use the internet on a plane, the 25Mbps transatlantic service to be offered by ViaSat-2 sounds like the golden ticket. The airlines win too, thanks to Wi-Fi letting them remove the seat-back screens in favour of passengers using their tablet or smartphone – a move which can save millions of dollars per plane and lower the fuel bill of every flight. Indeed, American Airlines announced in early 2017 it had ordered a fleet of new aircraft with no seat-back screens because 90% of passengers bring their own. Dankberg said: "Just to put things into perspective, its several million dollars a plane to put on a seat-back system, even on a relatively small one. The cost of installing Wi-Fi is like maybe a tenth of that. Then the ongoing operational costs are generally lower to provide Wi-Fi than to provide movies and live TV." There are opportunities here for content providers, too. Amazon Prime Video sponsors JetBlue's Wi-Fi, cutting the cost of the service to passengers to zero in return for grabbing an email address when they connect to the aircraft and displaying an ad on the now largely redundant seat-back screens. Dankberg says: "We've had good support from Netflix and Amazon. They are really interested in going out of their way to make their service available to people on airplanes, and the same for ships." A JetBlue aircraft comes into land at Long Beach airport, CaliforniaReuters On JetBlue flights Amazon gives passengers a free Prime Video trial to complete whatever they didn't get time to finish on the flight, after they've landed. Applied to ViaSat-2 and international flights, such an offer poses all sorts of licensing issues as content on UK and US services varies, but Dankberg believes a multi-day, transatlantic 'travel pass' could help bridge the gap. Netflix is certainly open to streaming from the sky, telling IBTimes UK: "The internet is improving everywhere – even at 35,000 feet...we know consumers want the freedom to watch Netflix whenever, wherever they are and advancements in the technology are making that both possible and affordable." But the journey to transatlantic and European-wide high speed internet has some turbulence ahead. Airlines on this side of the Atlantic share a hesitance to invest until "the right technology at the right price" becomes available - and with ViaSat being one of several options no one wants to invest millions of pounds only to have their fingers burnt, Betamax-style. Are the airlines on-board? Budget airline Ryanair, which is one of the fence-sitters and does not currently offer in-flight entertainment, told IBTimes UK: "We have been exploring the possibility of on-board Wi-Fi and are waiting on the right technology to facilitate a low cost entry point so that it is affordable for our customers. We are also actively exploring the possibility of being able to offer customers in-flight entertainment, such as movies or games they could access via their smartphones, tablets or laptops." Virgin Atlantic and British Airways will begin offering in-flight Wi-Fi later in 2017 via a service provided by Gogo, which uses both cellular towers and satellites to keep planes online. BA will offer the service for an as-yet unknown fee on most of its long-haul fleet. But where Gogo claims to offer speeds of up to 70Mbps, this is shared among all devices on-board, and even by several aircraft around busy airports. ViaSat vice president Don Buchman warned how the speed experienced by each passenger will vary. Passengers on JetBlue flights use their laptops on a plane equipped with Wi-FiReuters "The [ViaSat] service provides 12Mbps to every connected passenger device, as compared to competing services that give aggregate bandwidth to a plane, making passenger devices fight for internet service. Often it is not just one plane that is sharing the internet service, but multiple planes flying in that satellite beam. If there are 10 planes leaving Heathrow, all 10 with a total of 1,400 passengers could all be sharing the service, which would significantly degrade the internet quality. Offering a shared service to the plane will just not cut it; it doesn't scale across hundreds of planes with hundreds of users." As a result, and echoing claims made by Dankberg, Buchman believes airlines using services like Gogo will have to charge "a lot of money for a sub-par service" in order to "create friction" and put passengers off from connecting at all. Put simply, the more passengers put off by a high price, the fewer users and the better connection for those willing to pay. But Gogo chief executive Michael Small disagrees, telling IBTimes UK how ViaSat's reliance on two satellites means "limited coverage" and a service which will also suffer from congestion . "The bandwidth from these satellites is not only shared on the plane by all passengers and all other planes flying under them, that same bandwidth is also shared with hundreds of thousands of subscribers who use their service on the ground." Small adds that Gogo uses over 20 satellites, some of which are shared around hub airports to help boost the connection to each plane in crowded airspace. What this means, he says, is "passengers get the best performance today more often and in far more places with Gogo than with any competing service including ViaSat's." British Airways will bring Wi-Fi to long-haul flights later in 2017, but there are doubts over how fast the it will beReuters 'Comparing apples with oranges' Countering this from ViaSat's corner, Buchman says: "What our three satellites offer in terms of service quality, scale and affordability, is an apples-to-oranges comparison to any in-flight Wi-Fi provider...While our customers may 'share' access to our three satellites, they do not 'share' capacity because ViaSat has orders of magnitude more capacity than any other in-flight Wi-Fi provider...other in-flight Wi-Fi providers must purchase expensive wholesale bandwidth, and many cannot afford to buy enough to truly satisfy passenger demand – which results in passengers 'fighting' for, or 'sharing' the amount of purchased bandwidth. At ViaSat, we own our satellites". Despite the concerns raised by ViaSat, British Airways, which will use Gogo and Inmarsat for its in-flight Wi-Fi later this year, told IBTimes UK: "We're confident that the systems we've chosen will suit all our customer's requirements...[they] will be able to email, check social media and stream video [and] use multiple devices at the same time...connection speeds will be similar to what they have at home." To the future, Moore's Law - and ViaSat-4? Looking ahead and to the end of the decade, the ViaSat-3 project will include three satellites with even greater bandwidth. The first, launching in 2019, will cover North and South America; this will be joined in 2020 by a satellite beaming internet across Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Finally, a third satellite will launch at an as-yet unspecified time to cover the Asia-Pacific region. ViaSat claims the first two of these satellites will deliver more than twice the total combined network capacity of all 400 commercial communications satellites currently in space. This network will offer over 100Mbps connections to residential customers, letting them stream 4K, Ultra HD video. Airplane Wi-Fi will also get a speed boost, as will the internet connections of cruise ships, oil rigs and more. Paul Rusnock, Boeing general manage of satellite systems, points out how satellite bandwidth is following Moore's Law. Dankberg agrees, and when asked if ViaSat-4 could one day exist, adds: "We think there's another order of magnitude to go, so that's what we'll be working on."

While much of the public face of acquisition reform has focused of late on reducing the costs of major acquisition programs, the real savings will come from how the Pentagon manages its sustainment activities. More than 70 percent of the life cycle costs of a weapons system are experienced during sustainment. A proven way of reducing sustainment costs is by applying commercial best practices to defense acquisition and sustainment. One of these best practices when it comes to managing the maintenance, repair and overhaul of major weapons systems and platforms is Performance-Based Logistics (PBL). Unlike traditional fee-for-service or time-and-materials contracts, PBL works by specifying outcomes, not activities. The contractor commits to meeting a specified level of performance, say the percentage of a fleet of vehicles or aircraft available for operations, for a price (usually below what the government was paying before). The contractor also has incentives to improve its processes and, sometimes, even hardware, because these can increase its profits. Some PBL sustainment contracts also share savings between the contractor and the Pentagon.  PBL is a win-win because it is based on a core human value: do better in order to reap greater rewards. Since the early 1990s, across three administrations, DoD and industry have worked to apply the tenets of PBL to its sustainment contracts. Companies such as Boeing and Lockheed Martin have excelled at running PBL-based activities for the Pentagon. Boeing has more than a dozen PBL contracts with DoD and foreign ministries of defense.  Boeing manages very successful PBL contracts for the Marine Corps MV-22 Osprey and U.S. Army CH-47 Chinook and AH-64 Apache.  The British defense ministry has gone all-in on PBL arrangements, for example signing a 25-year contract with a Boeing-led team for the sustainment of that country’s CH-47 helicopters. The Boeing Integrated Sustainment Program for the U.S. Air Force’s C-17 Globemaster III (GISP) is a model PBL arrangement. The GISP provides integrated sustainment not only for the U.S. Air Force’s 222 C-17s but for more than 40 additional aircraft operated by the U.K. Royal Air Force, Royal Australian Air Force, Royal Canadian Air Force, Qatar Emiri Air Force and United Arab Emirates Air Force. In place for more than 20 years, through several successive multi-year contracts, the GISP proves the value of long-term PBL contracts.  According to Boeing, GISP has successfully reduced sustainment costs by about 40 percent over the past two decades. This resulted in savings of some $3 billion for DoD through FY 2014.  Sikorsky -- a Lockheed Martin Company -- has demonstrated equal success with respect to PBL-based sustainment. In late February, the Naval Supply Systems Command awarded the Maritime Helicopter Support Company (MHSCo), an erstwhile partnership between Lockheed Martin and what was until recently United Technologies’ Sikorsky division, a third five-year agreement for maintenance of more than 530 advanced Navy MH-60R and S models. The $2 billion fixed-price-per-flight hour PBL contract will run through 2020. The “Seahawk 2015” contract demonstrates the value of long-term PBL arrangements where both the government and contractor learn from the process and refine the character of their relationship. The new contract has MHSCo responsible for more than 1700 separate parts and components on some 530 MH-60R/S aircraft. The new contract includes maintenance for the advanced mission avionics associated with the MH-60R/S helicopters, particularly the common cockpit with its flat panel display technology. The new PBL contract also provides support for the Royal Australian Navy’s 24 MH-60Rs. The long-term nature of the Seahawk PBL enabled MHSCo to refine its maintenance activities and improve performance while lowering costs. Helicopter readiness has increased to a remarkable 92 percent and reliability has improved by 26 percent. In order to achieve these improvements, MHSCo invested $140 million to improve the reliability of parts and components and to streamline the logistics system. According to the company, this has resulted in a reduction in logistic response time of some 45 days as well as savings resulting from increased reliability of components and reduced maintenance times. MHSCo reports that the contract covers management of nearly $1 billion in inventory at 99.91 percent accuracy. The government and the company share savings that result from reduced demand to repair or replace a part. The Boeing and MHSCo contracts are among the best of the PBL story. But they are by no means the only ones. A 2010 study commissioned by the Pentagon examined some 21 PBL-based contracts, half of which had first been traditional fee-for-parts-and-labor arrangements before converting to the new model. It concluded that, properly structured and managed, PBL-based arrangements were able to increase value to the customer while reducing costs. Hopefully, once key personnel are in place, DoD can undertake to expand the use of PBL-based sustainment contracts. It is clear that this is an example of commercial best practices with wide application to DoD. Dr. Dan Goure is a Vice President of the Lexington Institute.

The money would pay for the fight against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS), more equipment across the services and other items considered urgently needed. "The appropriations request seeks to address critical budget shortfalls in personnel, training, maintenance, equipment, munitions, modernization, and infrastructure investment," budget Director Mick Mulvaney wrote in an outline sent to Congress. "The request is a first step in investing in a larger, more ready, and more capable force." A large portion of the supplemental request -- $24.9 billion -- would be added to the base defense budget, requiring a change to the budget cap law and making the request's prospects in Congress unclear. The remaining $5.1 billion would go toward a war fund known as the Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) account. Read the rest here. Trump released his budget blueprint for fiscal 2018 on Thursday. That proposal calls for a $54 billion boost in defense spending, offset by sharp cuts to domestic spending. For more on the budget proposal, click here. Click here for five takeaways from Trump's first budget.   MCCAIN: TRUMP BUDGET CAN'T PASS SENATE: The Trump administration also dropped it's first budget blueprint for fiscal 2018 on Thursday. But Sen. John McCainJohn McCainWhat two GOP senators get right and dangerously wrong about Afghanistan Shutdown politics return to the Senate Overnight Defense: Trump seeks B more for 2017 defense spending | Boeing VP tapped for Pentagon post MORE (R-Ariz.) quickly poured cold water on the proposal and said it won't pass the Senate.  "It is clear that this budget proposed today cannot pass the Senate," the Armed Services Committee chairman said in a statement. McCain added that as lawmakers work on funding the government, they must come up with a deal "that provides sufficient funds to rebuild the military." Trump's budget included $603 billion for total defense spending, which includes money outside of the Pentagon, plus an extra $65 billion in overseas contingency funding that is not subject to budget caps. But McCain argued that the baseline budget for repealing the 2018 fiscal year needs to be at least $640 billon and that lawmakers should start working on defense funding for the rest of the current fiscal year, which expires at the end of September.  The Hill's Jordain Carney has more here.   TRUMP NOMINATES BOEING VP, FIVE OTHERS FOR TOP PENTAGON ROLES: President Trump on Thursday nominated a top Boeing executive to be the second-highest-ranking civilian at the Pentagon. Trump announced Patrick Shanahan's nomination to be deputy Defense secretary, along with nominations for five other Pentagon roles, beginning to fill offices that have sat empty since his inauguration. Shanahan –who has been Boeing's senior vice president for supply chain and operations since April - will take over the deputy post from Bob Work, who served in the Obama administration and has stayed on in an interim role until his replacement could be put in place. Other nominations announced include the director of Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation (CAPE) and principal deputy under secretary of Defense, comptroller.

Jackie Speier (D-Calif.) unveiled a bill Thursday to close a loophole in military law that could allow some perpetrators of the Marines' nude-photo-sharing scandal to go unpunished. "I am furious, I am saddened, and I am frustrated by how we have got to this point," Speier said. Speier's bill is in response to "Marines United," a 30,000-member Facebook page on which service members allegedly shared nude photos and personal information of female Marines and veterans. The Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) currently makes taking nude photos without consent a punishable crime, but the nonconsensual sharing of private photos, often called "revenge porn," is not considered a crime in the military. Speier's bill would make such activity a punishable crime under the UCMJ.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 16 March 2017 by Military News Sustainability Communications Professionals Invited to 3BL Media ‘Best Practices’ Webcast Featuring Team Behind Boeing’s 2016 Environmental Report, March 30 at 11 a.m. ET NORTHAMPTON, Mass., Mar. 09 /CSRwire/ – The team who wrote and published Boeing’s 2016 environmental report will join 3BL Media for the next “Best Practices” webinar to share their formula for using multimedia and storytelling to convey the aerospace giant’s sustainability progress with audiences around the world.   “Beyond the Data: Sustainability Reporting Through Storytelling and Multimedia” is scheduled for 11 a.m. ET on March 30. There is no cost to attend, and the content is appropriate for CSR and sustainability professionals, and the communications executives who support them. REGISTER HERE Boeing, hailed by the the Carbon Disclosure Project as one of the world’s leading companies in reporting climate-change risks, recently published “Build Something Cleaner,” a 60-page environmental report that is a sharp departure from traditionally text-heavy corporate missives.   “Relying on 50 photographs, six videos and impactful infographics, Boeing’s environmental communications team has cracked the code on storytelling that connects with employees and customers just as effectively as investors and policymakers,” said Dave Armon, chief marketing officer at 3BL Media, who will act as moderator for the webcast. “We look forward to hearing how Boeing crafted its sustainability communications strategy and the resources used to publish and distribute the content for maximum engagement.” Two Boeing executives responsible for Environment, Health & Safety communications, Stephanie Miller and Mary Hanson, will join Armon for a discussion around the $96 billion company’s process for producing dynamic content that tells a holistic story including design and development, manufacturing and operations, and responsible retirement and recycling of equipment no longer in service. Innovations, like the cultivation of salt water plants to make renewable jet fuel, will also be included in the presentation. “In 2011, fewer than 20 percent of S&P 500 companies produced sustainability reports. That total jumped to 89 percent last year,” said Armon, citing Governance & Accountability Institute research. “Interest in sustainability is only going to grow, so communications professionals owe it to themselves to learn from experts the best practices for making this content easy to consume and share.” About Boeing Since July 15, 1916, Boeing has been making the impossible, possible. From producing a single canvas-and-wood airplane to transforming how we fly over oceans and into the stars, The Boeing Company has become the world’s largest aerospace company. About 3BL Media Based in Northampton, Massachusetts, 3BL Media is a corporate communications platform exclusively for the distribution of corporate social responsibility and sustainability news and content. Founded in 2009, the company works with corporations and non-profits to distribute multi-format media assets through social, traditional and new media channels. 3BL Media has grown organically and through acquisition, operating a network of focused, authoritative sites including 3blmedia.com, justmeans.com, csrwire.com, socialearth.org, ethicalperformance.com and reportalert.com. Content issued by 3BL Media clients also appears on hundreds of thousands of Bloomberg and Thomson Reuters terminals.

If it was extremely expensive Airbus would be killing them with the A350 and the A330NEO and they are not. You can't argue with 1200 sales it be extremely costly. Log In or Register to post comments GorbazTheDragon on Mar 17, 2017 I don't buy your comparison. The A350 is also extremely expensive (and has hauled in similar orders to the 787s) while the 330NEO is barely entering the assembly phase... Log In or Register to post comments RHHastings on Mar 17, 2017 @GorbazTheDragon yes, it may be difficult to use a resurrected the B787-3 as this NMA. And, in some ways John Leahy's comment, "a narrowbody will always be more aerodynamically economical than a small twin-aisle," holds true (albeit kinda hypercritical considering they named their A350 an "XWB," eXtra Wide Body, to trump Boeing's 787 in cabin width). On the other hand, among others holistically, Boeing has to determine how much turn-around time for a single verses a twin aisle is worth to operators. Log In or Register to post comments Advertisement Kwagga on Mar 17, 2017 You're missing the point. The article isn't comparing the B787 and the A350. Both are expensive. But the 787 is expensive relative to what airlines would be willing to pay for a narrowbody or transatlantic mission aircraft. Log In or Register to post comments Louis Klar on Mar 17, 2017 My son was on the ground floor of the 787. Ever since he has been in communication with 787 air crew across the planet. In every case they are thrilled with every aspect of the handling and capacity of that craft. he is now looking forward to the 797.. Log In or Register to post comments rkwi27@charter.net on Mar 18, 2017 Boeing is sitting on $28 BILLION of unamortized costs. if they sell 2,000 more they will need to charge each aircraft with $14 million of deferred costs, plus interest to carry that $28 billion. That's what makes this aircraft expensive. Log In or Register to post comments Captjack14 on Mar 17, 2017 I would say that " expensive" is relative. You pay what you get. The B787 ( and the A350) are very capable aircraft that do cost a lot of money. If you do not need or use those capabilities, then they are expensive. Airbus has maybe an advantage here since the A321 NEO or the A330 NEO are available . Tough decisions ahead ... Log In or Register to post comments ian16th on Mar 17, 2017 A thought from out of the box; how about a single aisle double deck option? Log In or Register to post comments FunkyBlood on Mar 17, 2017 From a technical point of view I don't know the advantages and disadvantages (probably aerodynamics would be a disadvantage) but i guess the airports won't like it because they need to re-equip their gates like they had to do it for a380 and that's quite expensive Log In or Register to post comments Bruce Billedeaux on Mar 17, 2017 I love that suggestion. It takes a page form double deck commuter trains. The upper deck doesn't need to be full size just as the cargo bay is not. Maybe a 4 seat wide upper deck, 6 on the main deck. All loading would be on the lower deck of course just like a 747. Log In or Register to post comments taw1159g on Mar 17, 2017 Good point. I was initially thinking like the A380 where gates would need to be redesigned (which would never happen for a MOM) but you could just as easily put the stairs inside the airplane and use a single entryway. I guess it would all come down to fuselage aerodynamics. Way back when Boeing was exploring a larger aircraft to the 707, they explored the single isle double decker, but ultimately came up with the wide body. I think the height of the design would be a challenge (minimum 220" if you're going to put standard containers below), which is already taller than the 767. Might as well just go double isle provided Boeing keeps with a standard aircraft design as opposed to a radical change like the blended wing. Log In or Register to post comments skitnik on Mar 18, 2017 +taw1159 don't think about boarding and disembarkation only. What about emergency evacuation requirements? Have you ever heard about that? Log In or Register to post comments larryat753@eart... on Mar 17, 2017 I would think that a double deck served by a stair case would make for very awkward loading and unloading what with passengers hauling all kinds of bags and the variety of young/old/children/physically challenged folks that fly. Turn-around times would go up Log In or Register to post comments 2ndGenLJer on Mar 17, 2017 Vertical CG is important in any maneuverable vehicle. Buses and trains have pretty docile mission profiles. A/C landing gear and handling characteristics would be hurt. Log In or Register to post comments czarnajama on Mar 17, 2017 Better yet, Mark Drela's MIT twin-aisle double-bubble semi-lifting body concept, with high aspect-ratio wings and rear-mounted engines? It changes the equation. Log In or Register to post comments yarbros@comcast.net on Mar 17, 2017 It is obvious why this would not work. If you take a tube that will accommodate one level of seating and then enlarge that tube so that another deck can be fitted above the first, then the diameter of the tube becomes much wider and therefore would become a widebody. This would be premised on the theory that a pure round tube is much stronger than an oblong tube and cheaper to build. One old innovation that was used when I flew commercially years ago was to have more than one jetway attach to the plane when boarding or deplaning. Using a twin-aisle plane and two jetways would halve the time required now and make turn around times more efficient. Log In or Register to post comments james.mahon@gma... on Mar 17, 2017 I would make a long narrowbody, but say 6 inches wider than an A321. The extra width could be used to make it easier to exit the plane with a wider aisle in some parts of the cabin and to have wider seats in others (for extra revenue). You could make it about 45-47 rows long, but with (say) a 32" seat pitch to give decent space and the ability to recline the seats enough for an 8-10 hour flight. Also, the doors could be pulled nearer the wing so you can exit from either side of the door. Log In or Register to post comments CheapEnglishman on Mar 17, 2017 What you describe is the 757. Why not update the 757 and bring it back. Everyone seemed to love it, the customers and the pilots. Log In or Register to post comments markg612 on Mar 17, 2017 This seems to be the elephant in the room that no one sees but continually references as the ideally capable design. It does exactly what everyone seems to need in a NMA design. All it ever needed was a fuselage diameter equal to or 6" greater than the A32x line Job done, get to it Boeing. Log In or Register to post comments Alphafloor@aol.com on Mar 17, 2017 Yes, please! Re-engine the thing, update other stuff and reopen the line. The 737-stretch is getting ridiculous. Log In or Register to post comments wdcore on Mar 17, 2017 The line is gone all the tooling equipment is long gone. There is nothing left to reopen. Log In or Register to post comments HB on Mar 17, 2017 Without a doubt CheapEnglishman, Boeing definitely dropped the ball on this one discontinuing the 757 without a replacement. Log In or Register to post comments skitnik on Mar 18, 2017 Perhaps "everyone" but aviation marketing people. And they are who dictate the airplanes manufacture. A321 sent B757 to the corner of the market, carrying the same amount of passengers with less fuel burn, 49,000 lb less MTOW with the similar passengers and payload. A321 cabin is more than 1 foot wider, giving more comfort to the passengers. The facts are: 2749 A321 vs. 913 B757 ordered. I mean A321 "classic", that is still flying with passengers only and is hard to find to lease. B757 is now mainly converted to a freighter - DHL and FedEx love them. Log In or Register to post comments Aircraftman789 on Mar 17, 2017 Not an easy choice here Aviation Enthusiasts, Boeing designed and had on offer the 787 ( 8 ) and it did not sell ? Likewise Airbus had the A-350 800 and that did not get sufficient orders to put it into production? so at the moment existing models from Airbus with N.E.O convertions are the order of the day, with Boeing hanging in with the 737 , but airlines who are Boeing Fans are starting to cry out for a New Aeroplane and after some Fifty Years and the loss of the 757 you can begin to understand why ! The problem is for Boeing to get it right and have an Aircraft that has the size, low purchase price and the Range they require. Hanging on to an old design and continually updating it has its temptations , but there does come a time when you have to go for new . Log In or Register to post comments L Vasudev on Mar 17, 2017 With congestion at airports in the air and on the ground, unavailability of slots, and unprecedented growth of traffic as many are beginning to take to the air for the first time and over shorter distances, there is definitely a case for a twin aisled medium capacity aircraft of medium to longish range, especially for Asian carriers where most of the traffic growth is taking place. Boeing could leverage technology already developed for a presenting a new aircraft in this category rather quickly so as to reduce development costs and keep price low. There will definitely be a need for aircraft in this class in the not too distant future. Log In or Register to post comments Pilot93434@att.net on Mar 17, 2017 The 787 is a great 767 replacement. What Boeing really needs is a 757 replacement. The A321neo is still not as capable as the 757 and never will be. Log In or Register to post comments a330boy on Mar 17, 2017 I agree. The A321 is a great plane for the US NE to Florida and Caribbean. It is a very marginal transcon machine, say nothing of trans Atlantic. Too much weight for that A320 wing. Years ago Boeing should have offered a B757neo. There would be no market for the A321neo today. Log In or Register to post comments skitnik on Mar 18, 2017 I agree the performance of A321 compared with A320 is softly speaking sihty... But A321 is a working horse, that does not need more than A320 and much less than B757. That is for maintenance and all the other costs. Who takes that airplane, takes it for its advantages, I mean as you say for US NE to Florida and the Caribbean, not for transcon or trans Atlantic. You will be probably surprised to hear, British Airways flies from London City airport to JFK by A318: LCY-SNN-JFK. Business class only, pax passing US border control, customs, HLS in Shannon, Ireland during the refueling and after landing in JFK, just leave the terminal. Log In or Register to post comments Sp4rr0w on Mar 17, 2017 I agree. Log In or Register to post comments NoWake on Mar 17, 2017 And yet, Boeing scraped the 757!! The 757 was hands down the BEST airplane I have ever flown, more than capable aircraft. But rather, Boeing keeps stretching and pulling on 1960 technology. From a pilot's point of view, this makes zero sense. Log In or Register to post comments Wingboy62 on Mar 17, 2017 Boeing simply didn't sell enough 757's. Orders dried up. Airlines/lessors can be fickle. I believe they only built 1000 of them. That's simply not enough to invest multi-billions of dollars in a "neo" plane in 2002-2004. And yet, most pilots, and NOW airlines, love(d) their 757's. Can Boeing capitalize? We shall see. Log In or Register to post comments Alphafloor@aol.com on Mar 17, 2017 Totally agree. Instead of doing a "clean sheet" design, Boeing stretched the 737 to a level of compromised performance (takeoff and landing especially). If they can do a revamp of the 757 and fast-track proven tech with new stuff they would have a winner. Log In or Register to post comments JeffRL on Mar 17, 2017 Is the stretched 737NG really 1960s technology? It may look more or less like the original 737, but how many components are interchangeable? The wings are new, the structure is new, the materials are modern, so are the manufacturing techniques. Log In or Register to post comments MjrDad on Mar 17, 2017 The 737 cockpit is the worst in the industry. You can change the displays all you want but the overhead panel and it's lack of automation is ridiculous. In addition, the cockpit is incredibly cramped. It was designed at a time when engineers said we'll design it, you just fly it. They new nothing about ergonomics nor human factors. That changed when we had had enough of people who knew nothing about flying airplanes telling us what we need. Airbus builds a better cockpit.

Now that mostly 737s and 757s fly from the mainland to Hawaii, sheer misery. I never liked the 757 because it was just a twin engine 707 from a passenger perspective.

Log In or Register to post comments shelly on Mar 18, 2017 I have not noticed that the Airbus 320 seats are any wider or more comfortable. Apparently, each airline configures the seats as it finds suitable - to its business, not its passengers... Log In or Register to post comments VADM on Mar 17, 2017 Other than proving Boeing could also build a composite airplane (with modern engines), I have never understood the 787 replacing the 767. This replacement is/was illogical to me. Today, the same scenario exists with the 757. What is the purpose for an almost 757, by building a redesign? Just re-engine the 757. Log In or Register to post comments wuzafan@yahoo.com on Mar 17, 2017 mcboeing chaepest way out would be a new wing and engines on a 767. modify the nose and tail cone as well. but that is not what mcboeing wants to do Log In or Register to post comments ckqualls on Mar 17, 2017 I'm not an engineer, so there are probably elements I am not aware of, but I always thought the 757 air frame could be brought back into production, with new engines and a new flight deck. Unless, of course, additional range or capacity for additional pax is required. Log In or Register to post comments jchang on Mar 17, 2017 when airlines say they don't want wide body economics, do they really mean that they don't want the huge cargo bays? that they are interested in a plane targeted at mostly passengers instead of passengers + cargo. I notice a lot of cargo on the transpacific flights - Asia to us. There was a Boeing drawing of a oval fuselage cross-section. How difficult is it to build? For transatlantic, even the 757 is not that good, in winter flying west against a strong jet stream, possibly stopping at Gander (though I would love to visit in the summer). Log In or Register to post comments JeffRL on Mar 17, 2017 Most airlines make a lot of money from the cargo they carry in passenger jets.

Shanahan (Photo: Boeing) Military.com | 16 Mar 2017 | by Richard Sisk President Donald Trump named a Boeing Co. executive Thursday to replace Deputy Secretary Bob Work, a holdover from the Obama administration, as the No. 2 civilian at the Pentagon after Defense Secretary Jim Mattis. The White House, on Mattis' recommendation, announced that fixed-wing and rotorcraft specialist Patrick Shanahan, now the senior vice president for supply chain and operations at Boeing, would be nominated as the successor to Work, a retired Marine artillery colonel who has taken on some of the toughest management assignments at the Defense Department on budgets, modernization and health care. Work, who served under former Defense Secretary Ashton Carter, agreed to stay on at Mattis' request as the new Trump administration struggled to fill political appointments requiring Senate confirmation throughout government. Mattis put Work in charge of budget workups that will likely keep him at the Pentagon through May. The overlap for Work put three Marines for the first time in the top three positions at the department -- Mattis, Work and Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Joseph Dunford, the former Marine commandant. Navy Capt. Jeff Davis, a Pentagon spokesman, said Mattis was grateful that Work had agreed to stay on until his successor is confirmed by the Senate. "His steady leadership is critical during this time of transition, and Secretary Mattis continues to have full confidence in him as he carries out crucial work in managing the Department," Davis said. At Boeing, Shanahan previously was senior vice president of airplane programs and oversaw the management for the 737, 747, 767, 777 and 787 programs, the White House said. Before that, Shanahan was vice president and general manager of Boeing's Missile Defense Systems unit and vice president and general manager for Rotorcraft Systems in Philadelphia, where he was responsible for all U.S. Army Aviation, including the Bell-Boeing V-22 Osprey tiltrotor, the CH-47 Chinook and the AH-64D Apache attack helicopter. Shanahan's was one of six nominations -- five of them from Virginia -- to fill posts at the Pentagon sent over to the Senate, all with Mattis' recommendations, according to the Pentagon. David Joel Trachtenberg of Virginia will was named to serve as principal deputy undersecretary of defense for policy, following the withdrawal of the nomination to that post of former Ambassador to Egypt Anne Patterson. Several Republican senators had signaled their opposition to Patterson's nomination. Trachtenberg is the president and CEO of Shortwaver Consulting LLC, a national security consultancy, and formerly was a staffer on the House Armed Services Committee. He previously served as principal deputy assistant secretary of defense for international security policy where he was responsible for issues relating to NATO, Europe, Russia and Eurasia, technology security, counter-proliferation, missile defense, nuclear forces, and arms control, the White House said. Kenneth P. Rapuano of Virginia was nominated to serve as assistant secretary of defense, homeland defense and global security. Rapuano has a long career in national security and homeland security affairs in the private, public and academic sectors, the White House said. He currently serves as senior vice president and director of the studies and analysis group at the ANSER Corp. David L. Norquist of Virginia, a partner with the accounting firm of Kearney and Co., was named to serve as undersecretary of defense, comptroller. Norquist has 27 years of experience in federal financial management beginning as a federal employee in 1989 with the Department of the Army, the White House said. Elaine McCusker of Virginia was named to serve as principal deputy undersecretary of defense, comptroller. McCusker currently is the director of resources and analysis at the headquarters of U.S Central Command at MacDill Air Force Base in Florida. Robert Daigle of Virginia, an Army veteran, was named to as director of cost assessment and program evaluation, known as CAPE. Daigle previously served in CAPE during the Bush administration as director of program resources and information systems management division. The flurry of nominations for the Pentagon posts came amid reports of growing friction between Mattis and the White House over the slow pace of appointments to his staff. -- Richard Sisk can be reached at Richard.Sisk@Military.com.

Trump is proposing a 9.4 percent increase in defense spending which amounts to an additional $54 billion. Insiders point this bump to be correlated to cuts in the Pentagon back in 2011. We have all read the countless statistics of America’s military spending and how it outshines the rest of the world by magnitudes. The focus on military strength could remind historians of Ashikaga Japan, which led to domestic issues. To make up for the increased spending, Trump has proposed to cut down on other “non-essential” government spending with a focus on entitlements. The question in budgets is always about allocation and within the largest subsection of the budget that is military spending how it is allocated will be important. Spending into the military reaches the economy wide and deep increasing sales of basic materials that include steel, employment of industrial and other engineers, researchers, logisticians, and more. Now is a time with such a great influx of money to watch out for rent-seekers or as Franklin D. Roosevelt would warn us from his State of the Union address in 1941, “beware of that small group of selfish men who would clip the wings of the American eagle in order to feather their own nests.” Costs should be managed and not be run out of control and competition amongst industries should be supported and lobbying to consolidate market share should be ignored from regulators. The results from a change in spending however will be hard to observe as some cost-savers cannot particularly be measured easily. The European Reassurance Initiative has voiced their concerns repeatedly over Russian aggression and are strategizing for a deterrence policy. A bigger military with a focus on protected communication, long range missile capabilities, and submarines can in theory deter an enemy from aggression. Hot spots for the U.S. globally are in the South China Sea, Eastern Europe, and the Middle East especially around the Mediterranean Sea. China has the world’s second largest military and after posting military budget increases in the double digits they plan to increase their budget for the upcoming year by 7 percent. This number can be translated in a number of ways, and the hard part is knowing the true motives. One reason may be that as their spending increased the percentage growth is going to flat line and another may be that they are allocating more into private industries especially for other military capabilities such as cyber warfare which would explain their recent interest in supporting semiconductor companies and reasserting their control over Taiwan that produces high-tech equipment. The U.S. currently has the most advanced technology, capability, aircraft carrier, fighter jets, heavy bombers, unmanned aircrafts, and more. Using them in a battlefield is another question as well as justifying the spending along with the other needs of the nation. ‘Mad Dog’ Mattis is confident looking forward.

The Pentagon is expected to put $2.8billion more toward its Presidential Aircraft Recapitalization program by 2021. If that money goes through, the US will have spent $11billion on the aircraft fleet over two decades - not including the funds needed to maintain the current fleet - having already spent $8.8billion since 2002. President Barack Obama was as critical of the funding as Trump has been, but his effort to cut costs came at a significant delay and with very little success. And a report from Bloomberg News shows that there have been several attempts at not only cutting costs, but also revamping the nearly 50-year-old fleet. Not much has been successful. Scroll down for video  The Pentagon is expected to put $2.8billion more toward its Presidential Aircraft Recapitalization program by 2021, reaching a total of $11billion over two decades. Pictured above, Trump waves from the steps of Air Force One earlier this month Trump first wrote about the cost of the presidential aircraft fleet in December, saying the US Air Force should cancel its order with Boeing for a pair of planes that are slated to serve as the new Air Force One and a backup aircraft A plane revitalization project - named the Presidential Aircraft Recapitalization program - has been in the works for several years, but is has faced plenty of stoppage. The two 747-200s that serve Air Force One will hit the end of their 30-year life expectancy this year, after first taking flight in 1987. Many of the Marine One helicopters have been part of the fleet since as early as 1974. The helicopter squadron contains 23 aircraft, 11 of which have been operating since 1974. Eight more date back to 1989. Outside the helicopter fleet, is the presidential airplane fleet, which includes Air Force One, smaller Gulfstream jets and older 757s that fly the Vice President. Four ultra-reinforced 'Doomsday' 747s sit ready at Offutt Air Force Base in Nebraska. In 2002, the Navy, which oversees Marine aviation programs, started a formal project to develop a new Marine One. It came after then-President George W Bush became frustrated at the lack of communication systems aboard Air Force One on September 11. The White House considered several options, including using other aircraft in the fleet as replacements, but ultimately decided to unveil a new helicopter by 2007. A plane revitalization project - dubbed as the Presidential Aircraft Recapitalization program - has been in the works for several years, but is has faced plenty of stoppage Dubbed the VH-71 by the Navy, the helicopters were projected to cost $180million each, which turned out to be an extremely low estimate. The plan for the helicopter was for it to be an 'Oval Office in the sky', complete with video conferencing and heavy armor. The fleet number fluctuated from 23 to 36, before going down again. The initial budget for the program was set at $6.5billion, then increased to $11.5billion by January 2007. By the time Obama was sworn in in 2009, the program had an estimated $13billion cost.

Share this article Share 28 shares In May 2008, after spending $3.3billion on the project, the Pentagon shut down the Marine One Program. But, after just three years, Obama decided to re-open the project. The Navy took a new approach the second time around, trying to cut costs, lower passenger capacity and getting rid of the planned kitchen and toilet. In 2013, the US Government Accountability Office praised the Navy's 'rational balance between requirements, costs and schedule'. The Pentagon is expected to put $2.8billion more toward its Presidential Aircraft Recapitalization program by 2021. Pictured above, Trump poses in his office aboard Air Force One Sikorsky Aircraft Corp, in Stratford, Connecticut, which manufactured every helicoptor in the squadron's first fleet, when Dwight Eisenhower was in office, won a $1.2billion contract to start the project. Two helicoptors have been built and are currently undergoing groud testing. If all goes well, their debut could come as early as 2020, and the full fleet would arrive by 2023. The total cost of the project is estimated to be $5billion, but Colonel Robert Pridgen, head of the Marine One program, said the cost is 'coming down as we speak'. But, senior Pentagon adviser John Young said, the president 'is going to get significantly less helicopter for that money'. Trump will have a bit of influence over the next Air Force One, which is still in its planning phase. But in the month after he was elected president, Trump voiced criticism over the cost of the new aircraft. Trump first wrote about the cost of the presidential aircraft fleet in December, saying the US Air Force should cancel its order with Boeing for a pair of planes that are slated to serve as the new Air Force One and a backup aircraft. 'Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!' Trump tweeted. If the $2.8billion is spent on new aircraft, the US will have spent $11billion on the aircraft fleet over two decades, having already spent $8.8billion since 2002. Pictured above, Trump and First Lady Melania Trump wave from the steps of Air Force One He hinted to reporters in the lobby of Trump Tower less than an hour later, however, that the Boeing contract could be continued once he moves in at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue because he wants Boeing to be profitable – to a point. 'The plane is totally out of control. It's going to be over $4billion – it's for [the] Air Force One program. And I think it's ridiculous,' Trump said. 'I think Boeing is doing a little bit of a number. We want Boeing to make a lot of money, but not that much money.' Since taking office, Trump has had nothing but praise for the current Air Force One plane, taking it on regular trips to Mar-a-Lago and using it on a visit to Boeing's South Carolina facility. It still remains unclear where Trump's $4billion number came from. Congress set aside $1.65billion last year to cover the entire Air Force One replacement program through 2019. Last year that number grew to $2.8billion through 2021. But as of December, Boeing's contract only called for $170million in payments for research, development and other preparations – not the plane-building itself. Senior Pentagon official John Young told Bloomberg: 'Both of these systems cost an absurd amount of money, but that's what we choose to do for the President of the United States to have increased safety and security. 'There aren't magic lessons that's going to make it cost half as much.'

The Defense Department said Wednesday the company will also provide remanufactured and new build AH-64Es and Longbow crew trainers; peculiar ground support equipment; initial spares; integrated logistics support; and engineering technical services. Boeing will perform work under the modification in Mesa, Arizona, through June 30, 2022. The Army Contracting Command will use the military branch’s “other” procurement funds in fiscal years 2010, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2021 to cover the full obligated amount. Boeing also received an $18.3 million contract modification from the U.S. Air Force in February to supply AN/APG-63(V) 3 radars for Saudi Arabia’s F-15 fleet and a separate $46.4 million modification in early March to perform interim contractor support on the country’s F-15s.

Dan Coats has been sworn in as the nation’s top spy chief. Vice President Mike Pence administered the oath of office after the Senate voted Wednesday to confirm Coats’ nomination by a vote of 85-12. Coats will be President Trump’s top intelligence official overseeing 16 other intelligence agencies. Coats will be the fifth person to serve as director of national intelligence, a job the U.S. created after the 9/11 attacks. He succeeds James Clapper, who retired just before Trump took office. 2No criminal charges: Federal and state prosecutors who have been conducting separate investigations into Mayor Bill de Blasio’s campaign fundraising practices said on Thursday that they would not be bringing criminal charges against him or his aides. However, the mayor did not escape unscathed. The state prosecutor, the Manhattan district attorney, criticized de Blasio, saying his effort to help state Democrats appeared to violate the intent and spirit of the law. The federal inquiry involved a broad examination of whether de Blasio or his administration or campaign aides exchanged favorable city action for donations to his 2013 campaign or his now-defunct political nonprofit. 3 Pentagon No. 2: The White House announced Thursday that President Trump has nominated senior Boeing executive Pat Shanahan as deputy secretary of defense. After a rocky start between the new administration and the aerospace and defense giant, the nomination of Shanahan, now senior vice president for supply chain and operations at Boeing, is the latest sign of an increasingly cozy relationship. Shanahan, 54, has no military or political experience. He is, however, familiar with defense procurement from the business side. If Shanahan’s nomination is confirmed by the U.S. Senate, he’ll be chief deputy to Defense Secretary James Mattis. 4Lawmaker surrenders: Oklahoma prosecutors on Thursday filed child prostitution charges against a Republican state senator after police found him in a hotel room with a 17-year-old boy. Ralph Shortey, 35, surrendered to authorities on charges of engaging in child prostitution, transporting a minor for prostitution and engaging in prostitution within 1,000 feet of church. His bond was set at $100,000. The age of consent in Oklahoma is 16, but Oklahoma’s prostitution statute applies to any person under 18 years old. 5Pastor charged: The Rev. Rowland Foster, a pastor in a fundamentalist Christian sect in Mechanicsburg, Pa., that rejects doctors and drugs, has been charged in the death of a child — his own granddaughter — from medical neglect. The novel prosecution is raising hopes among some advocates that it might spur change in a church that has resisted it. Faith Tabernacle Congregation has long told adherents to place their trust in God alone for healing. As a result, dozens of children, mostly in Pennsylvania, have died of preventable and treatable illnesses.

A supplemental budget proposal for the remainder of this year asks for $13.5 billion to modernize military aircraft. Lee Jin-man AP i By Vera Bergengruen vbergengruen@mcclatchydc.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story WASHINGTON The White House on Thursday asked Congress for a $30 billion boost for the Pentagon to start fulfilling President Donald Trump’s campaign promise of rebuilding the U.S. military and accelerating the campaign against the Islamic State over the next six months. In his supplemental budget request to Congress for fiscal year 2017, President Donald Trump asked for $5.1 billion to fund combat operations overseas, mainly to “end the threat ISIS poses to the United States.” Of that, $2 billion would be in a “flexible” fund to be used as needed to combat ISIS. It comes as Trump’s Pentagon considers deploying up to 1,000 more U.S. troops to help retake the terrorist group’s de facto capital of Raqqa in Syria. $5.1 billion Estimate of the amount of funding that is needed to accelerate the U.S. campaign to defeat ISIS in FY 2017, according to the Pentagon The supplemental budget allocates an extra $1.1 billion for the war in Afghanistan for what remains of the 2017 fiscal year. The top U.S. commander in Afghanistan, Army Gen. John Nicholson, told the Senate last month that “several thousand” more U.S. troops are needed to break the stalemate against the Taliban. The 2017 request also asks for more funding for infrastructure projects, including at the Guantanamo Bay prison in Cuba, which is currently holding 41 detainees. “It doesn’t seem like we are going to close it anytime soon,” the acting Pentagon comptroller, John Roth, told reporters at the Pentagon on Thursday. [READ MORE: Top U.S. commander: Afghanistan ‘stalemate’ requires thousands more troops] The rest of the supplemental funding, $24.9 billion, would go towards “urgent warfighting readiness needs,” to address shortfalls for troops’ training, equipment, munitions and modernization, according to Trump’s letter to House Speaker Paul Ryan. That amount includes $13.5 billion to build and modernize additional Army Apache and Blackhawk helicopters, F-35 and F/A 18 fighter jets, tactical missiles and unmanned aircraft. Defense contractors Lockheed Martin and Boeing, who make the aircraft, would be big beneficiaries of this proposal. “The request is a first step in investing in a larger, more ready, and more capable force,” Mick Mulvaney, director of the Office of Management and Budget, wrote in a letter to Congress. According to the proposal, this spending would be partially offset by $18 billion in cuts to non-defense programs, although the White House did not specify where they would be made. The plan asks Congress to raise the defense spending cap for the 2017 fiscal year by $25 billion, to $576 billion. [READ MORE: Why military leaders say Trump’s planned budget cuts are a national security risk] The supplemental budget would cover the coming months until Sept. 30, when fiscal year 2017 ends. Trump’s proposed budget for the 2018 fiscal year, which was also released on Thursday, boosts military spending by $52 billion and designates $4 billion for the construction of a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. It would go into effect on Oct. 1. The proposal drastically cuts funding for the State Department and foreign aid, and domestic budgets for education, health, agriculture and environmental programs. EDITORS: STORY CAN END HERE Trump’s proposed budget outlines the military buildup he touted during his presidential campaign, including rebuilding the Navy. However, it does not placate defense hawks in Congress, who say the $52 billion boost for 2018 is not nearly enough to fix what they describe as a critical, and rapidly growing, readiness crisis. “It is clear to virtually everyone that we have cut our military too much and that it has suffered enormous damage,” House Armed Services chairman Rep. Marc Thornberry, R-Texas, said. “Unfortunately, the administration’s budget request is not enough to repair that damage and to rebuild the military as the president has discussed.” facebook twitter email Share More Videos 1:06 FHP trooper critically hurt in Dolphin Expressway accident Pause 2:13 Marlins pitcher Dan Straily talks about preparing for first season with Marlins 3:36 Treasury Secretary Mnuchin announces Venezuela sanctions 0:36 Video shows Darren Rainey being taken out of cell by prison staff 0:28 Airport strike halts flights from Haiti 6:39 Miami Dolphins GM Chris Grier talks free agency at combine 1:31 Prison guards respond to a collapsed Darren Rainey 2:38 Jaromir Jagr: I'll beat Gordie after 50 as well 0:26 Key deer infected with screwworm on road to recovery 0:46 Florida House Speaker Corcoran addresses Tiger Bay Club in Pensacola Share Video Video link: Select Embed code: Select facebook twitter email Trump touts 'America first' message at CPAC President Donald Trump criticized the news media and 'fake news,' talked about cracking down on illegal immigration, blasted Obama care, and touted his plan to put "America first" at the Conservative Political Action Conference on Friday. C-SPAN But he said he was pleased with the supplemental request for 2017, telling reporters that it was “more than I expected.” “It is needed and will give us a head start on improving readiness and replacing old equipment. But, it is only one step,” he said. Former Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta, who served under President Barack Obama, said on Thursday that a sudden, massive boost makes it more difficult for the Pentagon to plan defense spending and might be unsustainable. “I don’t like defense spending that goes on a roller coaster ride, where one year it goes up dramatically by $54 billion and then next year, as a result of sequester or some crazy across the board cut, it’s dramatically cut,” he told Bloomberg. He also said he disagreed with cutting State Department and foreign aid programs, which many military leaders have argued prevent unnecessary military spending in the long run. “I believe like Jim Mattis does, that if you’re not going to provide foreign aid or help our diplomatic effort in dealing with other countries, then the bottom line is you have to buy more bullets,” he said. “It doesn’t make a lot of sense.” Vera Bergengruen: 202-383-6036, @verambergen Related content LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story Politics Suggested for you Comments Videos facebook twitter email Share More Videos 1:06 FHP trooper critically hurt in Dolphin Expressway accident Pause 3:36 Treasury Secretary Mnuchin announces Venezuela sanctions 1:13 White House: Mexico border wall could be funded by tax on imports 3:11 White House responds to father of slain Navy Seal 1:43 Spicer says anyone refuting success of Yemen raid owes fallen Navy SEAL apology 1:43 2016 Election Day by the numbers 0:49 Trump names Alexander Acosta as pick for Labor Secretary 1:26 Mulvaney: Trump's budget 'blueprint' will represent 'top-line numbers only' 3:40 Widow of slain Navy SEAL receives standing ovation at Trump speech 1:31 Obama waves goodbye, takes off in helicopter Share Video Video link: Select Embed code: Select facebook twitter email 3 days ago 5 things to know about the CBO's report on Paul Ryan's ACA replacement 1:39 3 days ago 5 things to know about the CBO's report on Paul Ryan's ACA replacement 1:35 3 days ago White House: Trump paid $38M in taxes in 2005 0:38 4 days ago 'I want my whole damn dollar' View more video Politics Lottery rakes in cash but fewer students, particularly poor ones, make cut for scholarships Florida House: We hate tax credits for businesses ... except for golf!

Although Congress must approve the $13.5 bln request and is likely to make changes, Boeing Co would be one of the biggest beneficiaries of the administration’s proposal, which included $2.3 billion for 24 F/A-18 E/F Super Hornet jet fighters. This is 10 more than the U.S. House of Representatives approved on March 8 in its 2017 base spending bill. The Navy will use the additional money to bolster its aging fleet of fighters, Lieutenant General Anthony Ierardi, the director of Force Structure, Resources and Assessment for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told Reuters. zIn a Dec. 22 tweet, before he was inaugurated, Trump had suggested buying more Boeing F/A-18s, which he called “comparable” to the Lockheed Martin F-35, despite the fact that the F-35 is a stealth aircraft difficult for enemy radar to detect. The 1990s-vintage F/A-18 is does not use stealth technology. You may also like to watch: The Navy also proposed $920 million to buy six Boeing P-8 submarine-hunting aircraft. The Army requested $708 million for 20 Boeing Apache attack helicopters. Lockheed Martin is also one of the big winners in the administration’s proposal. Pentagon officials said the request for additional 2017 funds would help accelerate planned acquisitions of F-35 Joint Strike Fighters. The Pentagon budgeted $596 million to buy five of the stealthy jets, which cost between $95 million and $123 million each, depending on the model. In the past, President Trump had complained about the “tremendous cost and cost overruns” of the F-35 program, which is the Pentagon’s most expensive weapons program. The Pentagon budgeted $151 million for Lockheed’s THAAD missile defense and $376 million for 17 Blackhawk helicopters made by Sikorsky Aircraft, a Lockheed subsidiary. The proposal also requested $433 million to complete the third version of the DDG-51 Navy destroyer being built by General Dynamics Corp at Bath Iron Works in Maine. A General Accounting Office report published on Aug. 4 said the Navy “has not demonstrated sufficient acquisition and design knowledge” to provide an accurate estimate of the vessel’s cost. The administration’s supplemental request takes the base Pentagon budget for fiscal 2017 to $541 billion, analyst Robert Stallard of Vertical Research said in a report on Thursday. Congress will likely consider the request before April 28, when the current Defense Department funding expires. Please Wait while comments are loading...

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it By Aaron Gregg By Aaron Gregg March 16 Follow @Post_AG A rendering showing what Lockheed Martin’s 60-killowatt laser might look like when deployed on one of the Army’s Family of Military Tactical Vehicles (FMTV) trucks. A Lockheed Martin spokesman said the laser beam would not actually be red and would not be visible when deployed. The red coloring was added for effect. (Lockheed Martin) Lockheed Martin said Thursday it has finished a 60-kilowatt laser system for the U.S. Army Space and Missile Defense Command and is preparing to hand it over to the Army for further testing. In initial tests, the company achieved 58 kilowatts of power but expects its laser to reach its full potential by the time of its delivery in the next few months. The laser is what the company calls a “combined fiber” laser beam, bringing together individual lasers to form a single, stronger beam. Lockheed has been testing it at an installation in Bothell, Wash., and plans to ship it to an Army installation in Huntsville, Ala., in the next few months. “We’re really at the dawn of an era of the utility of laser weapons,” said Robert Afzal, senior fellow for laser and sensor systems at Lockheed Martin. The Army’s specialized military vehicles “can now carry something which is small enough and powerful enough for what we believe will be militarily useful.” Multiple military agencies and defense companies have been working on laser weapon capabilities. In 2014, Boeing published a video of its 10-kilowatt laser destroying a mortar in flight. Proponents say lasers could be cheaper than traditional munitions systems because they don’t require expensive projectiles and they don’t need to be reloaded. That could make the system useful in taking down airborne adversaries, such as off-the-shelf drones. The idea of an off-the-shelf drone fleet commanded by a non-state entity presents new challenges for a global military establishment that has focused for centuries on war with other governments. For example, Gen. David Perkins said this week that a U.S. ally had taken down an adversary’s off-the-shelf quad-copter — which can be purchased online for a few hundred dollars — with a multimillion-dollar Patriot missile. Mark Gunzinger, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, said: “That’s $3 million to shoot down a three-or-four-hundred-dollar drone. . . . What if you could do that with a beam of light that costs a buck?” More powerful projectiles such as Hellfire missiles are also more likely to cause collateral damage, making them less practical in certain situations. Proponents say laser weaponry could be more precise and ultimately more effective against small airborne targets. Lasers “hit targets at the speed of light, they cost almost nothing per shot, and they have an almost unlimited number of times they can be used,” said Loren Thompson, chief operating officer of the nonprofit Lexington Institute, which receives funding from defense firms including Lockheed Martin and Boeing. “A medium-sized laser should be able to take out any number of drones in a very short period of time because they are so fragile.” The Navy has already deployed a ship-based laser that it says is ready for combat use, but the Army faces a unique set of challenges. To protect American soldiers from low-budget drone fleets, the Army would need a highly mobile laser that can sit on the back of a truck. The agency would have to find a way to carry enough battery power to fire continually without the truck overheating. Such a large power source isn’t a problem if it’s stationary on a ship or military installation, but moving it around the battlefield might be difficult. With the 60-kilowatt laser announced this morning, Lockheed says that it has reached that goal and that the weaponry is ready to be deployed. “In terms of the maturity of this technology to be field-able on an Army vehicle, this technology is ready for that,” Afzal said. The company said its initial testing showed the laser to be near physical limits for accuracy and reasonably energy-efficient, directing 43 percent of electricity used to power it directly into the laser itself, helping it deal with the mobility problem. The system is designed to be a low-weight solution that sits on a ground-based vehicle called a Heavy Expanded Mobility Tactical Truck (HEMTT), essentially a truck designed for carrying large artillery.  The Army already has laser weapons it is testing, but Lockheed’s laser may have advantages in power and portability. The 60-killowatt laser has its origins in the Defense Department’s Robust electric laser initiative, which started in 2010 and ended when a 15-kilowatt laser was developed. The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, or DARPA, has its own initiative to create a turret-based laser that can fire downward from an aircraft. world national-security checkpoint Get 2016 Olympics updates by email Our best news and analysis from Rio, delivered to your inbox. post_newsletter333 magnet-olympics2016 false after3th false Please provide a valid email address.

Sun March 19, 2017  |  Updated 01:38 PM IST  |Home| Sitemap Search for: State| National| Business| Opinion| Sports| International| Horoscope | Daily Horoscope Weekly Horoscope Photo Gallery| Suggestion| Sunday Magazine| Letters| RSS Feed Menu State National Business Opinion Sports International Horoscope Daily Horoscope Weekly Horoscope Photo Gallery Suggestion Sunday Magazine Letters RSS Feed Breaking News: Art 370 guarantees emotional position to J&K people: Mehbooba E-Paper Indian aviation is flying high Posted on 17/03/2017 by Dailyexcelsior Dr Ashwani Mahajan Two decades ago air travel was limited to a select club of politicians, officers and bureaucrats. There was a complete monopoly of public sector civil aviation corporations (Air India and Indian Airlines etc.). Air travel was very costly. At a point of time, when per capita income in the country was hardly rupees 5000 per annum, one sided air fare from Delhi to Mumbai was between rupees 6000 and rupees 10,000. Time changed, and a big number of low cost private aviation companies entered into the market, leading to big reduction in fares and number of passengers multiplied. Today, when per capita income in the country is nearly rupees one lakh annually, one can travel between Delhi and Mumbai for a mere rupees 2100 (if booking is made well in advance). Growth in civil aviation is evident from the fact that number of air passengers increased from 1.40 crores in 2000-01 to 13.5 crores (both domestic and international). That is, 16.3 percent growth annually. During 2015-16, this growth has been 21.6 percent and 9 percent in domestic and international passengers respectively. Aviation Flying High Thanks to fast growth in Indian civil aviation, private sector companies have started achieving big targets. Company on the forth position in terms of business, ‘Spice Jet’, has placed orders for 205 Max 707 aircrafts from Boeing company. This huge order from a company on fourth position, has raised expectations in the industry. It is notable that before this largest company ‘Indigo’ and another company ‘Go Air’ had also placed orders with ‘Airbus’ for few hundred aircrafts. Global manufacturers of aircrafts are looking forward to Indian aviation market for their future growth. From Losses to Profits A few years back, Indian aviation companies have been incurring huge losses due to cut throat competition on the one hand and high petroleum prices on the other. In last few years, their losses have been wiped off and now they have started recording profits, as prices of petroleum products have come down heavily, leading to low fuel cost. However, competition in the aviation sector continues, causing huge reduction in fares. It is notable that if one books an air travel few months in advance, he/she pays only rupees 2100 and rupees 2800 for Delhi-Mumbai and Delhi-Bangluru sectors respectively. However, 2 tier AC travel (Rajdhani) costs rupees 4105 and rupees 5470 respectively. This means, competition among aviation companies have brought air fares to nearly half (or even less) than railway fares. Despite this competition they are earning profits. But their profits may vanish if petroleum prices increase. If we go by Economic Survey 2016-17, petroleum prices may increase by 15 percent or even more. Therefore if this happens, profits of aviation companies may evaporate. India’s Growth Story In 2014, 324 crore people travelled by air globally, which increased to 348 crore and 370 crore in 2015 and 2016 respectively. This means travelers’ growth had been 7.1 percent in 2015 and 6.3 percent in 2016. However, if we look at travelers’ growth in India we find that in 2014-15, 11.6 crore people travelled by air, which increased to 13.5 crores in 2015-16. This implies 16.4 percent growth. On an average, Indian civil aviation industry experienced a growth of 8.3 percent annually in terms of passengers in last 15 years. Global giant ‘Airbus’ expects 11 percent growth in Indian aviation. Today there are 22 civil aviation companies operating in India. India stood at 9th position globally in civil aviation. It is expected that by 2020, our civil aviation industry will reach at 3rd position globally. This is so because we are expecting at least 11 percent growth in comparison to hardly 5 to 6 percent growth globally. Imperative for Healthy Growth of Aviation In the last 15 years, air passengers (domestic and international) in India grew 9.65 times; and Indian civil aviation industry reached at 9th position globally. Thanks to fast pace of Indian civil aviation, global air craft manufacturers are looking towards India as their potential market, where they can sell 1850 aircrafts by 2036. However, Indian companies have been facing huge problems due to cut-throat competition. It is notable that this cut-throat competition forced India’s first private sector aviation company ‘Air Deccan’ to ‘Kingfisher’ another aviation company, which itself went into bankruptcy later. Thanks to lower petroleum prices, these companies have again started earning profits. However, we must understand that this situation is not going to last forever. Today, the need of the hour is that all companies progress on the basis of healthy competition. There should be a complete assessment of passenger traffic on all routes and accordingly fare structure be arrived at. In the present system one can travel at a very low fare, if tickets ae booked well in advance, but heavy tariff is charged if tickets are booked for current travel. According to data published by Directorate General Civil Aviation (DGCA), seats ranging from 8 to 33.5 percent remained vacant in 2015-16 in different aviation companies. It is ironical that whereas lakhs of railway passengers are unable to travel on waitlisted tickets, so many seats go vacant for want of passengers. We can easily encourage passengers, from waitlisted AC railway tickets to travel by air, by giving slightly higher fare. Air India has introduced this service partially. Other aviation companies should follow suit.

Although both the Senate and House of Representatives are controlled by Trump's fellow Republicans, Congress holds the federal purse strings and seldom approves presidents' budget plans.Trump's plan took a big swipe at some federal institutions, envisaging a more than 31 percent cut, or $2.6 billion, for the Environmental Protection Agency and a 28 percent reduction, or $10.9 billion, for the State Department and other international programs.In a message with his budget submitted to Congress, Trump said he aimed to advance "the safety and security of the American people," adding he would do so with $54 billion in added military spending next year and putting more money into deporting illegal immigrants.Predictably, Democrats denounced the proposed steep cuts to spending on domestic programs. But some prominent Republicans were also quick to criticize the budget.Protecting national interests requires a comprehensive approach, "including not just military engagement but also the full and responsible use of all diplomatic tools at our disposal," said Republican Representative Hal Rogers, who chairs a panel that oversees State Department and foreign aid spending.Under Trump's plan, funding would disappear altogether for 19 independent bodies that count on federal money for public broadcasting, the arts and regional programs from Alaska to Appalachia.Moderate Republicans expressed unease with potential cuts to popular domestic programs such as home-heating subsidies, clean-water projects and job training.Trump's budget outline covered just "discretionary" spending, or programs that must be renewed annually by Congress, for the 2018 fiscal year starting on Oct. 1.It did not address mandatory "entitlement" programs, such as Social Security retirement benefits and federally-backed healthcare for the elderly, poor and disabled, that make up most of the federal budget. For years, conservatives have been clamoring for reforms to these programs to save money.Trump also asked for $25 billion more for core Defense Department programs for the current fiscal year, as well as $5 billion more for combat operations. A detailed copy of this request seen by Reuters showed some of the added funds would be for procurement of technology such as F-35 fighter aircraft and drone systems. About $13.5 billion of the supplemental request was earmarked for aircraft, missiles and ships. It included THAAD missiles, Blackhawk helicopters and F-35s made by Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N), as well as F/A-18 warplanes and Apache helicopters manufactured by Boeing Co (BA.N).Also for this fiscal year, Trump requested $3 billion more for the Department of Homeland Security, with some of that money intended for planning and construction of the border wall that he made a major part of his 2016 election campaign.Congress will likely consider the supplemental request by April 28, when regular funding expires for most federal agencies.OPEN FOR DISCUSSION On the 2018 budget, Trump is willing to discuss priorities with Congress, said White House budget director Mick Mulvaney, a former South Carolina congressman who made a name for himself as a spending hawk before he was picked to join Trump's Cabinet.House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi blasted the plan, saying, "Throwing billions at defense while ransacking America’s investments in jobs, education, clean energy and lifesaving medical research will leave our nation weakened." Moderate Republicans expressed unease with potential cuts to popular domestic programs such as home-heating subsidies, clean-water projects and job training. For years, conservatives have sought many of these proposals, only to see them defeated amid opposition from Democrats and some moderate Republicans. It was unclear whether Trump will have more success. The budget outline does not incorporate Trump's plan for sparking $1 trillion in investments to build roads, bridges, airports and other infrastructure projects. The White House has said the infrastructure plan is still to come.The planned defense increases are matched by cuts to other programs so as to not increase the $488 billion federal deficit.Mulvaney acknowledged the proposal would likely result in significant cuts to the federal workforce, saying, "You can’t drain the swamp and leave all the people in it." Reflecting Trump's repeated election campaign pledge to reduce illegal immigration, the Department of Homeland Security would get a 6.8 percent increase, with more money for extra staff needed to catch, detain and deport illegal immigrants. WALL MONEY Trump wants Congress to approve $1.5 billion for the border wall in the current fiscal year - enough for pilot projects to determine the best way to build it - and a further $2.6 billion in fiscal 2018, Mulvaney said.The estimate for the total cost of the wall will be included in the full budget. That more detailed document is expected in mid-May and will project spending and revenues over 10 years.Trump has repeatedly said that Mexico will pay for the wall, and Mexico has adamantly said it will not. Since Trump took office in January, the White House has said funding would be kick-started in the United States.The full budget plan will include economic forecasts and the president's views on "mandatory entitlements" like Social Security and Medicare, which Trump vowed to protect while he was on the campaign trail.Despite the proposed big cuts to the EPA and the State Department, Mulvaney said their "core functions" would be preserved. Hit hard would be foreign aid, grants to multilateral development agencies like the World Bank and climate change programs at the United Nations.Trump wants to get rid of more than 50 EPA programs, end funding for former Democratic President Barack Obama's signature Clean Power Plan aimed at reducing carbon dioxide emissions, and cut research programs on renewable energy at the Energy Department.Other reductions and cuts included community development grants at the Housing Department, which have been around since 1974, more than 20 Education Department programs, anti-poverty grants and a program that helps poor people pay their energy bills.Trump's rural base did not escape cuts. The White House proposed a 21 percent reduction to the Agriculture Department, including reducing staff in county offices and ending a popular program that helps farmers donate crops for overseas food aid.(Click here for a graphic on 'Winners and losers in Trump's budget' here) (Additional reporting by Julia Edwards Ainsely, Richard Cowan and Patricia Zengerle; Editing by Peter Cooney, Bill Trott and Frances Kerry) This story has not been edited by Firstpost staff and is generated by auto-feed. #Reuters Published Date: Mar 16, 2017 10:47 pm | Updated Date: Mar 16, 2017 10:47 pm Top Stories Sexual harassment at the workplace: Amid the grey noise, remember safety should trump speculation Jat Agitation: Metro to Curtail Service in NCR From Sunday Night LIVE India vs Australia, 3rd Test, Day 4, cricket scores and updates: Pujara, Saha put hosts in command at lunch Uttar Pradesh CM Yogi Adityanath: BJP has made its boldest ideological statement Reviewing portfolio regularly: A comparison of SIP performance Donald Trump and Angela Merkel: Stark differences in full view during icy first meeting An officer and a gentleman: Why people in Burhan Wani's Tral backyard love Major Rishi Aishwarya Rai Bachchan's father Krishnaraj Rai passes away Cricket Scores Current & Recent Upcoming Afghanistan and Ireland in India, 5 ODI Series, 2017 Afghanistan and Ireland in India, 5 ODI Series, 2017 Afghanistan beat Ireland by 34 runs Australia in India, 4 Test Series, 2017 South Africa in New Zealand, 3 Test Series, 2017 South Africa beat New Zealand by 8 wickets Bangladesh in Sri Lanka, 2 Test Series, 2017 Afghanistan and Ireland in India, 5 ODI Series, 2017 Afghanistan beat Ireland by 30 runs Afghanistan and Ireland in India, 3 T20I Series, 2017 Afghanistan beat Ireland by 28 runs Afghanistan and Ireland in India, 3 T20I Series, 2017 Afghanistan beat Ireland by 17 runs (D/L method) England in West Indies, 3 ODI Series, 2017 England beat West Indies by 186 runs Afghanistan and Ireland in India, 3 T20I Series, 2017 Afghanistan beat Ireland by 6 wickets Afghanistan and Ireland in India, 5 ODI Series, 2017 AFG vs IRE - Mar 22nd, 2017, 09:30 AM IST Afghanistan and Ireland in India, 5 ODI Series, 2017 AFG vs IRE - Mar 24th, 2017, 09:30 AM IST South Africa in New Zealand, 3 Test Series, 2017 NZ vs SA - Mar 25th, 2017, 03:30 AM IST Australia in India, 4 Test Series, 2017 IND vs AUS - Mar 25th, 2017, 09:30 AM IST Bangladesh in Sri Lanka, 3 ODI Series, 2017 SL vs BAN - Mar 25th, 2017, 02:30 PM IST Pakistan in West Indies, 4 T20 International Series, 2017 WI vs PAK - Mar 26th, 2017, 10:00 PM IST Bangladesh in Sri Lanka, 3 ODI Series, 2017 SL vs BAN - Mar 28th, 2017, 02:30 PM IST Pakistan in West Indies, 4 T20 International Series, 2017 WI vs PAK - Mar 30th, 2017, 10:00 PM IST Bangladesh in Sri Lanka, 3 ODI Series, 2017 SL vs BAN - Apr 1st, 2017, 09:30 AM IST Pakistan in West Indies, 4 T20 International Series, 2017 WI vs PAK - Apr 1st, 2017, 10:00 PM IST Site Index हिंदी फर�?स�?टपोस�?ट About Firstpost Newsletter RSS Twitter Facebook Sections Front Page Politics Sports India World Business Life Entertainment Photos Videos Plus New Delhi Mumbai Photos Videos FP Exclusives Cartoons Video Room eBooks Weather Others Sample Papers Online Business Technology News MTV India Online Shopping in India Budget 2017 Assembly Election Results 2017 Weather E-Learning Franchise Opportunity Tools RSS Feeds Apps iOS Android Copyright © 2017.

According to a statement released March 16, there is a growing demand for the service provided by the company’s CFM56-5B/7B maintenance shop, which was launched at Moscow Domodedovo International Airport in 2016. The shop was organized in a partnership with SR Technics. The facility at Domodedovo was initially expected to service two dozen engines in its first year of operation, the company said in a statement, but S7 Engineering personnel managed to repair 50 engines in the first 10 months—between May 2016 and early March 2017. A third of the performed operations involved heavy maintenance jobs on CFM56-5B/7B engines. During this period, the company provided CFM56-5B/7B repair services to Aeroflot Airline, Nordavia, Rossiya Airlines, UTair Aviation and S7 Airlines. “Unfortunately, we had to decline a number of potential orders because the demand for our engine maintenance services, immediately after we launched the facility, proved considerably higher than its capacity,” Engineering Holding’s deputy general director Roman Fedorov said. “This is why we decided to double our powerplant maintenance by opening a similar facility at Mineralnye Vody.” According to the company statement, S7 Engineering will continue to localize aircraft component maintenance in Russia in 2017. TAT Engineering, a joint venture with TAT Technologies, will open at Novosibirsk Tolmachevo Airport this spring to provide heat exchanger overhaul services. Engineering holding facilities are certified by the European Aviation Safety Agency, Bermuda DCA, Russian aviation authorities and a number of other national authorities to carry out maintenance for different types of Airbus, Boeing and Sukhoi aircraft.

Trump's plan, showcasing his administration's priorities, is just the first volley in what will likely be an intense battle over spending in coming months. Although both the Senate and House of Representatives are controlled by Trump's fellow Republicans, Congress holds the federal purse strings and seldom approves presidents' budget plans. Trump's plan took a big swipe at some federal institutions, envisaging a more than 31 percent cut, or $2.6 billion, for the Environmental Protection Agency and a 28 percent reduction, or $10.9 billion, for the State Department and other international programs. In a message with his budget submitted to Congress, Trump said he aimed to advance "the safety and security of the American people," adding he would do so with $54 billion in added military spending next year and putting more money into deporting illegal immigrants. Predictably, Democrats denounced the proposed steep cuts to spending on domestic programs. But some prominent Republicans were also quick to criticize the budget. Protecting national interests requires a comprehensive approach, "including not just military engagement but also the full and responsible use of all diplomatic tools at our disposal," said Republican Representative Hal Rogers, who chairs a panel that oversees State Department and foreign aid spending. Under Trump's plan, funding would disappear altogether for 19 independent bodies that count on federal money for public broadcasting, the arts and regional programs from Alaska to Appalachia. Moderate Republicans expressed unease with potential cuts to popular domestic programs such as home-heating subsidies, clean-water projects and job training. Trump's budget outline covered just "discretionary" spending, or programs that must be renewed annually by Congress, for the 2018 fiscal year starting on Oct. 1. It did not address mandatory "entitlement" programs, such as Social Security retirement benefits and federally-backed healthcare for the elderly, poor and disabled, that make up most of the federal budget. For years, conservatives have been clamoring for reforms to these programs to save money. Trump also asked for $25 billion more for core Defense Department programs for the current fiscal year, as well as $5 billion more for combat operations. A detailed copy of this request seen by Reuters showed some of the added funds would be for procurement of technology such as F-35 fighter aircraft and drone systems. About $13.5 billion of the supplemental request was earmarked for aircraft, missiles and ships. It included THAAD missiles, Blackhawk helicopters and F-35s made by Lockheed Martin Corp, as well as F/A-18 warplanes and Apache helicopters manufactured by Boeing Co. Also for this fiscal year, Trump requested $3 billion more for the Department of Homeland Security, with some of that money intended for planning and construction of the border wall that he made a major part of his 2016 election campaign. Congress will likely consider the supplemental request by April 28, when regular funding expires for most federal agencies. OPEN FOR DISCUSSION On the 2018 budget, Trump is willing to discuss priorities with Congress, said White House budget director Mick Mulvaney, a former South Carolina congressman who made a name for himself as a spending hawk before he was picked to join Trump's Cabinet. House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi blasted the plan, saying, "Throwing billions at defense while ransacking America's investments in jobs, education, clean energy and lifesaving medical research will leave our nation weakened." Moderate Republicans expressed unease with potential cuts to popular domestic programs such as home-heating subsidies, clean-water projects and job training. For years, conservatives have sought many of these proposals, only to see them defeated amid opposition from Democrats and some moderate Republicans. It was unclear whether Trump will have more success. The budget outline does not incorporate Trump's plan for sparking $1 trillion in investments to build roads, bridges, airports and other infrastructure projects. The White House has said the infrastructure plan is still to come. The planned defense increases are matched by cuts to other programs so as to not increase the $488 billion federal deficit. Mulvaney acknowledged the proposal would likely result in significant cuts to the federal workforce, saying, "You can't drain the swamp and leave all the people in it." Reflecting Trump's repeated election campaign pledge to reduce illegal immigration, the Department of Homeland Security would get a 6.8 percent increase, with more money for extra staff needed to catch, detain and deport illegal immigrants. WALL MONEY Trump wants Congress to approve $1.5 billion for the border wall in the current fiscal year - enough for pilot projects to determine the best way to build it - and a further $2.6 billion in fiscal 2018, Mulvaney said. The estimate for the total cost of the wall will be included in the full budget. That more detailed document is expected in mid-May and will project spending and revenues over 10 years. Trump has repeatedly said that Mexico will pay for the wall, and Mexico has adamantly said it will not. Since Trump took office in January, the White House has said funding would be kick-started in the United States. The full budget plan will include economic forecasts and the president's views on "mandatory entitlements" like Social Security and Medicare, which Trump vowed to protect while he was on the campaign trail. Despite the proposed big cuts to the EPA and the State Department, Mulvaney said their "core functions" would be preserved. Hit hard would be foreign aid, grants to multilateral development agencies like the World Bank and climate change programs at the United Nations. Trump wants to get rid of more than 50 EPA programs, end funding for former Democratic President Barack Obama's signature Clean Power Plan aimed at reducing carbon dioxide emissions, and cut research programs on renewable energy at the Energy Department. Other reductions and cuts included community development grants at the Housing Department, which have been around since 1974, more than 20 Education Department programs, anti-poverty grants and a program that helps poor people pay their energy bills. Trump's rural base did not escape cuts. The White House proposed a 21 percent reduction to the Agriculture Department, including reducing staff in county offices and ending a popular program that helps farmers donate crops for overseas food aid.

By Roberta Rampton and Richard Cowan, Reuters Posted March 16, 2017, at 1:24 p.m. Last modified March 16, 2017, at 8:06 p.m. Related stories What Trump cut in his budget WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump asked Congress on Thursday to approve a 2018 budget that would bolster military programs and begin building a wall on the southern border with Mexico while drastically cutting many federal agencies. Trump’s plan, showcasing his administration’s priorities, is just the first volley in what will likely be an intense battle over spending in coming months. Although the Senate and House are controlled by Trump’s fellow Republicans, Congress holds the federal purse strings and seldom approves presidents’ budget plans. Trump’s plan took a big swipe at some federal institutions, envisaging a more than 31 percent cut, or $2.6 billion, for the Environmental Protection Agency and a 28 percent reduction, or $10.9 billion, for the State Department and other international programs.

Predictably, Democrats denounced the proposed steep cuts to spending on domestic programs. But some prominent Republicans were also quick to criticize the budget. “These increases in defense come at the expense of national security,” said Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham, who has not hesitated to take on Trump. Republican Sen. Marco Rubio, who like Graham ran unsuccessfully for president in 2016, leveled similar sentiments, as did some prominent Republicans in the House. House Speaker Paul Ryan sidestepped reporters’ questions about whether he supported State Department cuts, saying the White House blueprint was just the start of the budget process. Protecting national interests requires a comprehensive approach, “including not just military engagement, but also the full and responsible use of all diplomatic tools at our disposal,” said Republican Rep. Hal Rogers, who chairs a panel that oversees State Department and foreign aid spending. Under Trump’s plan, funding would disappear altogether for 19 independent bodies that count on federal money for public broadcasting, the arts and regional programs from Alaska to Appalachia.

Congress will likely consider the supplemental request by April 28, when regular funding expires for most federal agencies. Open for discussion On the 2018 budget, Trump is willing to discuss priorities with Congress, said White House budget director Mick Mulvaney, a former South Carolina congressman who made a name for himself as a spending hawk before he was picked to join Trump’s Cabinet. House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi blasted the plan, saying, “Throwing billions at defense while ransacking America’s investments in jobs, education, clean energy and life-saving medical research will leave our nation weakened.” U.S. Sen. Angus King, an independent from Maine who caucuses with Democrats, said that he “recognize[s] and agree[s] with the need to reduce federal spending as part of a balanced effort to tackle the debt and deficit, but I have a hard time seeing how eliminating heating assistance, cutting medical research, and ending economic development funding do little more than harm people, families and businesses across Maine.” “To me, this doesn’t seem like a serious attempt to offer a reasonable, cost-cutting budget — and, sadly, it’s hard-working, middle-class folks throughout the state who would bear the brunt of it all,” King said. Moderate Republicans expressed unease with potential cuts to popular domestic programs, such as home-heating subsidies, clean-water projects and job training. “I am troubled by the proposed reductions for certain education programs, low-income heating assistance and weatherization, clean energy technology and other programs,” said U.S. Sen. Susan Collins, a Republican from Maine known for her moderate stance. “I am particularly concerned about the proposed cuts in life-saving biomedical research at the NIH, which threaten to impede the important progress that has been made in our fight to develop treatments, means of prevention, and cures for diseases such as diabetes, ALS, Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s, our nation’s most costly disease,” Collins said. U.S. Rep. Chellie Pingree, a Democrat from Maine who sits on the House Appropriations Committee, called Trump’s budget “foolish and shortsighted,” saying that it would leave Americans less healthy, safe and economically secure. “Cutting Meals on Wheels, heating assistance for low-income families, and essential economic stimulus programs that rural states like Maine rely on in order to build a 1.5 billion dollar wall with Mexico shows how out of touch President Trump is with the needs of real Americans,” Pingree said. Even Maine Republican U.S. Rep. Bruce Poliquin was critical of some aspects of the budget. “I’m specifically concerned about making too significant reductions for programs like [Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program], Community Development Block Grants and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting,” he said. However, Poliquin, a member of the House Committee on Veterans’ Affairs, praised the impact the proposed budget could have on veterans. “I’m extremely encouraged the president has signaled he shares this interest in his proposal, which promises vital increases to veterans’ services in Maine and across the nation,” he said. For years, conservatives have sought many of these proposals, only to see them defeated amid opposition from Democrats and some moderate Republicans. It was unclear whether Trump will have more success. The budget outline does not incorporate Trump’s plan for sparking $1 trillion in investments to build roads, bridges, airports and other infrastructure projects.

The White House proposed a 21 percent reduction to the Agriculture Department, including reducing staff in county offices and ending a popular program that helps farmers donate crops for overseas food aid. Pingree, a champion of agricultural issues and a member of House Appropriations Subcommittee on Agriculture, said the proposed cuts to the USDA would “cripple” the agency and harm farmers and rural communities in Maine. “Slashing all discretionary funds from Rural Business and Cooperative Services will only stifle economic development in rural America and harm the very communities that the President claims to support,” she said.

Trump's plan, showcasing his administration's priorities, is just the first volley in what will likely be an intense battle over spending in coming months. Although both the Senate and House of Representatives are controlled by Trump's fellow Republicans, Congress holds the federal purse strings and seldom approves presidents' budget plans. Trump's plan took a big swipe at some federal institutions, envisaging a more than 31 percent cut, or $2.6 billion, for the Environmental Protection Agency and a 28 percent reduction, or $10.9 billion, for the State Department and other international programs. In a message with his budget submitted to Congress, Trump said he aimed to advance "the safety and security of the American people," adding he would do so with $54 billion in added military spending next year and putting more money into deporting illegal immigrants. Predictably, Democrats denounced the proposed steep cuts to spending on domestic programs. But some prominent Republicans were also quick to criticize the budget. Protecting national interests requires a comprehensive approach, "including not just military engagement but also the full and responsible use of all diplomatic tools at our disposal," said Republican Representative Hal Rogers, who chairs a panel that oversees State Department and foreign aid spending. Under Trump's plan, funding would disappear altogether for 19 independent bodies that count on federal money for public broadcasting, the arts and regional programs from Alaska to Appalachia. Moderate Republicans expressed unease with potential cuts to popular domestic programs such as home-heating subsidies, clean-water projects and job training. Trump's budget outline covered just "discretionary" spending, or programs that must be renewed annually by Congress, for the 2018 fiscal year starting on Oct. 1. It did not address mandatory "entitlement" programs, such as Social Security retirement benefits and federally-backed healthcare for the elderly, poor and disabled, that make up most of the federal budget. For years, conservatives have been clamoring for reforms to these programs to save money. Trump also asked for $25 billion more for core Defense Department programs for the current fiscal year, as well as $5 billion more for combat operations. A detailed copy of this request seen by Reuters showed some of the added funds would be for procurement of technology such as F-35 fighter aircraft and drone systems. About $13.5 billion of the supplemental request was earmarked for aircraft, missiles and ships. It included THAAD missiles, Blackhawk helicopters and F-35s made by Lockheed Martin Corp, as well as F/A-18 warplanes and Apache helicopters manufactured by Boeing Co. Also for this fiscal year, Trump requested $3 billion more for the Department of Homeland Security, with some of that money intended for planning and construction of the border wall that he made a major part of his 2016 election campaign. Congress will likely consider the supplemental request by April 28, when regular funding expires for most federal agencies. OPEN FOR DISCUSSION On the 2018 budget, Trump is willing to discuss priorities with Congress, said White House budget director Mick Mulvaney, a former South Carolina congressman who made a name for himself as a spending hawk before he was picked to join Trump's Cabinet. House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi blasted the plan, saying, "Throwing billions at defense while ransacking America's investments in jobs, education, clean energy and lifesaving medical research will leave our nation weakened." Moderate Republicans expressed unease with potential cuts to popular domestic programs such as home-heating subsidies, clean-water projects and job training. For years, conservatives have sought many of these proposals, only to see them defeated amid opposition from Democrats and some moderate Republicans. It was unclear whether Trump will have more success. The budget outline does not incorporate Trump's plan for sparking $1 trillion in investments to build roads, bridges, airports and other infrastructure projects. The White House has said the infrastructure plan is still to come. The planned defense increases are matched by cuts to other programs so as to not increase the $488 billion federal deficit. Mulvaney acknowledged the proposal would likely result in significant cuts to the federal workforce, saying, "You can't drain the swamp and leave all the people in it." Reflecting Trump's repeated election campaign pledge to reduce illegal immigration, the Department of Homeland Security would get a 6.8 percent increase, with more money for extra staff needed to catch, detain and deport illegal immigrants. WALL MONEY Trump wants Congress to approve $1.5 billion for the border wall in the current fiscal year - enough for pilot projects to determine the best way to build it - and a further $2.6 billion in fiscal 2018, Mulvaney said. The estimate for the total cost of the wall will be included in the full budget. That more detailed document is expected in mid-May and will project spending and revenues over 10 years. Trump has repeatedly said that Mexico will pay for the wall, and Mexico has adamantly said it will not. Since Trump took office in January, the White House has said funding would be kick-started in the United States. The full budget plan will include economic forecasts and the president's views on "mandatory entitlements" like Social Security and Medicare, which Trump vowed to protect while he was on the campaign trail. Despite the proposed big cuts to the EPA and the State Department, Mulvaney said their "core functions" would be preserved. Hit hard would be foreign aid, grants to multilateral development agencies like the World Bank and climate change programs at the United Nations. Trump wants to get rid of more than 50 EPA programs, end funding for former Democratic President Barack Obama's signature Clean Power Plan aimed at reducing carbon dioxide emissions, and cut research programs on renewable energy at the Energy Department. Other reductions and cuts included community development grants at the Housing Department, which have been around since 1974, more than 20 Education Department programs, anti-poverty grants and a program that helps poor people pay their energy bills. Trump's rural base did not escape cuts. The White House proposed a 21 percent reduction to the Agriculture Department, including reducing staff in county offices and ending a popular program that helps farmers donate crops for overseas food aid.

(Photo: PIERRE VERDY / AFP/Getty Images) 1 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORE Washington — The White House announced nominees for six senior Pentagon jobs on Thursday, including a longtime Boeing Co. executive for deputy secretary of defense, in its most significant step toward surrounding Defense Secretary Jim Mattis with Trump administration picks. President Donald Trump has struggled to fill top Defense Department positions. Mattis is the only administration nominee to be confirmed at the Pentagon. Until Thursday, the administration had only announced four other nominees; two of those later withdrew. Trump’s pick for deputy secretary is Patrick M. Shanahan. The latest manifestation of Mattis’ struggle came earlier this week when he abandoned an effort to get White House approval for his choice of policy chief, Anne W. Patterson, a career diplomat who was opposed by some Senate Republicans. The White House’s nominees list Thursday didn’t include a new policy chief, but it did name a deputy policy chief. A Pentagon spokesman, Navy Capt. Jeff Davis, said Mattis recommended all six of the nominees to the White House. Each requires Senate confirmation. As deputy secretary of defense, Shanahan would succeed Robert Work, a former Marine and Obama administration holdover. Work is the only senior Pentagon official from the prior administration still in place, although others have been performing the duties of senior officials in the absence of Trump nominees. Shanahan moved up through the management ranks at Boeing over a career that began in 1986. The Puget Sound Business Journal called him a Boeing “fix-it” man in a March 2016 report on Shanahan’s promotion to his current position. He oversees the company’s global supply chain strategies and use of advanced manufacturing technologies. Shanahan was a central to getting the 787 Dreamliner on track after production problems in the program’s early years, the report said. Boeing’s website says Shanahan is a member of the company’s executive council, reporting directly to the chairman and president, Dennis Mullenburg. Shanahan previously was senior vice president of airplane programs from 2008 to 2016 and vice president and general manager of Boeing Missile Defense Systems. A Washington state native, Shanahan is currently chairman of the University of Washington’s Board of Regents. He holds a bachelor of science degree in mechanical engineering from the University of Washington and two advanced degrees from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. David Joel Trachtenberg, nominated for the No. 2 policy job, is president of Shortwave Consulting, a national security consulting firm. He has held several Pentagon positions, including principal deputy assistant secretary for international security policy responsible for NATO, Europe, Russia and Eurasia issues. He penned a December 2015 commentary saying the Obama administration failed to adapt to a changing reality with Russia following its annexation of Crimea, incursions into eastern Ukraine, and more aggressive military exercises. “Despite Moscow’s clear shift toward a more threatening nuclear posture, U.S. policy remains stuck in the mud of unrealistic and outdated assumptions,” Trachtenberg wrote. Elissa Slotkin, who was acting assistant secretary of defense for international security affairs for the final two years of the Obama administration, said Trachtenberg was a member of Trump’s Pentagon transition team and was viewed as holding mainstream Republic views on national security issues. “We were happy to have him on the transition team because he reflected an experienced foreign policy perspective, in contrast to President Trump,” she said in a telephone interview. The White House said it also intends to nominate: —David L. Norquist, a partner with accounting firm Kearney and Co., as budget chief. --Elaine McCusker, currently director of resources and analysis at U.S. Central Command headquarters at McDill Air Force Base in Florida, as deputy budget chief. Mattis knows her from his years as commander of Central Command. --Robert Daigle as director of Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation, which provides the secretary of defense with independent analysis of major acquisition programs. He served in that office during President George W. Bush’s administration. --Kenneth P. Rapuano as assistant secretary of defense for homeland defense. He is senior vice president at ANSER Corp., which describes itself as a not-for-profit research institute with emphasis on national security and homeland defense. 1 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORE Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.

By Paul Ausick March 13, 2017 10:30 am EDT Print Email Tweet By the end of March, Boeing Co. (NYSE: BA) will have started construction on a final assembly plant in China for the company’s 737 passenger jets. The U.S. company signed an agreement last October with Chinese plane maker Commercial Aviation Corp. (aka, Comac) to develop the plant, which is expected deliver its first finished airplane sometime next year. When fully operational the final assembly plant, located in Zhoushan, is expected to deliver 100 finished aircraft per year. Workers at the plant will install in-flight entertainment systems and seats in planes destined for China-based airlines. Boeing also will build and operate a 737 delivery center. At an industry conference in San Diego last week, Boeing revealed specifications for a new member of the 737 MAX family — the 737-10, a stretched version of the 737-9 that seats the same number of passengers (according to Boeing) as the Airbus A321neo. Boeing also claimed the new airplane would cost 5% less to operate than the A321neo. Airbus, of course, disputed both claims. Boeing did not reveal the list price of a 737-10, but it is likely to be slightly less than the $124.4 million list price for the A321neo. Here is the current Boeing price list for the 737 family: 737-700: $80.6 million 737-800: $96.0 million 737-900ER: $101.9 million 737-7 (MAX 7): $90.2 million 737-8 (MAX 8): $110.0 million 737-200 (MAX 200): $112.9 million 737-9 (MAX 9): $116.6 million According to a report at Leeham News, China Development Bank (CDB) Leasing is a believer in the 737-10. CDB Leasing has about 250 airplanes in its portfolio, with lease customers in China and elsewhere. Boeing thinks that combined sales of the 737-9 and 737-10 will account for about 25% of all sales in the new MAX versions of the 737. Boeing hopes for an official launch of the 737-10 this year but has not yet officially specified an entry-into-service target. Leeham News cites Market Intelligence with a planned date of 2020, but another big leasing customer, Air Lease Corp. (NYSE: AL) CEO John Plueger thinks that is too late and that the 737-10 needs to enter service no later than 2019. Boeing’s stock traded down about 0.4% early Monday morning, at $178.02 in a 52-week range of $122.35 to $185.71. The consensus price target on the stock is $173.75, according to MarketWatch.

President Donald Trump has struggled to fill top Defense Department positions. Mattis is the only administration nominee to be confirmed at the Pentagon. Until Thursday, the administration had only announced four other nominees; two of those later withdrew. Trump’s pick for deputy secretary is Patrick M. Shanahan. The latest manifestation of Mattis’ struggle came earlier this week when he abandoned an effort to get White House approval for his choice of policy chief, Anne W. Patterson, a career diplomat who was opposed by some Senate Republicans. The White House’s nominees list Thursday didn’t include a new policy chief, but it did name a deputy policy chief. Online Chat: Beth Killoran, deputy assistant secretary for Information Technology and chief information officer at HHS, on March 28. A Pentagon spokesman, Navy Capt. Jeff Davis, said Mattis recommended all six of the nominees to the White House. Each requires Senate confirmation. Advertisement As deputy secretary of defense, Shanahan would succeed Robert Work, a former Marine and Obama administration holdover. Work is the only senior Pentagon official from the prior administration still in place, although others have been performing the duties of senior officials in the absence of Trump nominees. Shanahan moved up through the management ranks at Boeing over a career that began in 1986. The Puget Sound Business Journal called him a Boeing “fix-it” man in a March 2016 report on Shanahan’s promotion to his current position. He oversees the company’s global supply chain strategies and use of advanced manufacturing technologies. Shanahan was a central to getting the 787 Dreamliner on track after production problems in the program’s early years, the report said. Boeing’s website says Shanahan is a member of the company’s executive council, reporting directly to the chairman and president, Dennis Mullenburg. Shanahan previously was senior vice president of airplane programs from 2008 to 2016 and vice president and general manager of Boeing Missile Defense Systems. A Washington state native, Shanahan is currently chairman of the University of Washington’s Board of Regents. He holds a bachelor of science degree in mechanical engineering from the University of Washington and two advanced degrees from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. David Joel Trachtenberg, nominated for the No. 2 policy job, is president of Shortwave Consulting, a national security consulting firm. He has held several Pentagon positions, including principal deputy assistant secretary for international security policy responsible for NATO, Europe, Russia and Eurasia issues. He penned a December 2015 commentary saying the Obama administration failed to adapt to a changing reality with Russia following its annexation of Crimea, incursions into eastern Ukraine, and more aggressive military exercises. “Despite Moscow’s clear shift toward a more threatening nuclear posture, U.S. policy remains stuck in the mud of unrealistic and outdated assumptions,” Trachtenberg wrote. Elissa Slotkin, who was acting assistant secretary of defense for international security affairs for the final two years of the Obama administration, said Trachtenberg was a member of Trump’s Pentagon transition team and was viewed as holding mainstream Republic views on national security issues. “We were happy to have him on the transition team because he reflected an experienced foreign policy perspective, in contrast to President Trump,” she said in a telephone interview. The White House said it also intends to nominate: —David L. Norquist, a partner with accounting firm Kearney and Co., as budget chief. —Elaine McCusker, currently director of resources and analysis at U.S. Central Command headquarters at McDill Air Force Base in Florida, as deputy budget chief. Mattis knows her from his years as commander of Central Command. —Robert Daigle as director of Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation, which provides the secretary of defense with independent analysis of major acquisition programs. He served in that office during President George W. Bush’s administration. —Kenneth P. Rapuano as assistant secretary of defense for homeland defense. He is senior vice president at ANSER Corp., which describes itself as a not-for-profit research institute with emphasis on national security and homeland defense.

Politics How do you think Trump did this week? Let us know ENTERTAINMENT ARTS & CULTURE For architects, Trump's wall reveals as much as it promises to close off A portion of the U.S.-Mexico border is seen south of Yuma, Ariz. Guillermo Arias / AFP/ Getty Images A portion of the U.S.-Mexico border is seen south of Yuma, Ariz. A portion of the U.S.-Mexico border is seen south of Yuma, Ariz. (Guillermo Arias / AFP/ Getty Images) Christopher HawthorneContact ReporterArchitecture Critic As I was reminded during a visit to Germany this month, Berlin is not one of those cities, like Rome, where you understand history in layers, as a process of accretion. Berlin is a city where space has been cleared out — often by force — for a new version of history to stand apart from everything that’s come before. The longest preserved stretch of the Berlin Wall — officially overseen by the Topography of Terror, a museum exploring the history of the Third Reich — is an unmistakable case in point. You don’t turn a corner and stumble onto it. As you approach on foot you begin to sense a full quarter-mile away that more than 500 feet of it is standing in the middle of a clearing, a pockmarked monument of concrete and exposed rebar that you can view essentially in the round. There is a historical reason for that, of course. This section of the wall, along Niederkirchnerstrasse, formerly Prinz-Albrecht-Strasse, was built next to the ruins of the buildings that housed the Gestapo and the SS during the Nazi regime. There was no need for the East German government, as it sealed off its own citizens in the summer of 1961, to shoehorn this part of the wall into a crowded neighborhood. What had been the rubble of Nazi architecture, after those buildings were bombed and later razed, was easily transformed into a tabula rasa for Cold War construction. Walls that divide one country, or one ideology, from another are like that. We think of them as being pinned along an edge by necessity. In fact their path of least resistance is often to move into and occupy vacuums in the physical landscape. And in the political or philosophical one as well. Consider the way President Donald Trump’s proposed border wall has been greeted by American architects. After the Department of Homeland Security announced last month that it would be soliciting fast-track bids for “several prototype wall structures in the vicinity of the United States border with Mexico,” and then start awarding commissions to build actual stretches of wall by the middle of April, a debate broke out about whether it made ethical sense for architects and engineers to take part. According to reporting by Kriston Capps for the website CityLab and my colleague Carolina Miranda in The Times, many large firms, including Bechtel, Boeing and AECOM, decided not to participate in the bidding process. (Many midsize firms were happy to.) There were also plenty of smaller architecture offices that shocked nobody by refusing to join in — and probably wouldn’t have been considered given their lack of experience managing large infrastructure projects. Instead attention focused on a tiny firm called JuneJuly that appeared on the “pre-solicitation list” of potential wall designers. The office was founded by Jake Matatyaou, who teaches at the Southern California Institute of Architecture in Los Angeles, and Kyle Hovenkotter, who lives in New York and teaches at Columbia University and Pratt Institute. They were approaching the wall project, they told Miranda, from a “post-national” point of view. “I think the nation-state is a kind of outdated construct,” Hovenkotter said. “But I also understand that if there is a system in which to play, you might want to play in it and make the best of it.” Those statements, predictably, brought on heaps of ridicule. In response, the architects decided they needed to do a little damage control. “Dear Christopher,” they wrote in an unsolicited email that apparently went to other critics and journalists as well, “We would like to clarify our position on the border wall pre-solicitation.” What followed was not clarification but something closer to six paragraphs of rhetorical quicksand: Every time I struggled to understand what the two architects were trying to say I sank further into the muck. Here’s a representative sample: “Whether hard or soft, thick or thin, loud or mute, borders produce and negate various political imaginaries and subjectivities, both individual and collective.” SIGN UP for the free Essential Arts & Culture newsletter » Left entirely unacknowledged was the fact that these two architects could have made every point they wanted to make without signing up to build a wall that is far more about fear-mongering than national security. (In fact more Mexican immigrants have left the United States to return to Mexico since 2008 than have migrated to this country; what’s more, immigrants on the whole are less likely to commit crimes than people born here.) They could have written an essay about the border and its meanings or launched a studio for their students exploring similar issues. They could have sketched or built a “post-national” stretch of wall for a client other than the federal government or at a site removed from the border. Instead they logged onto a federal website and added their names to a long list of firms trying to get work. They needed an actual commission to attach their theoretical notions to — a wall on which to scratch out a meandering graffito about political imaginaries. This is all too typical of architects, this inability to notice (or in extreme cases to care) that the platform they’re leaping onto to promote their high-toned ideas is not a neutral stage but somebody else’s neck. Put in slightly more generous terms: There is something in the architectural temperament that suggests, often against all evidence, that ill-advised projects can be redeemed. This moral vacuum is carefully protected beginning in architecture school, where (with very few exceptions) nobody teaches students how to say no to an unethical or misguided client — or even, for the most part, that it’s possible to give such an answer. Maybe somebody should. As the Spanish architect Iñaki Ábalos has suggested, the profession needs more Bartlebys, more architects willing simply to say, in the words of that Melville character, “I would prefer not to.” I’m also left wishing that the late architect Lebbeus Woods, who had a firmer grasp on the political implications of architecture (built or unbuilt) than anyone of his generation, were around to weigh in on Trump and the border. This is the surprising effect of the president’s potential wall. Like the Berlin Wall before it, it is conceived in primitive terms, as a blunt instrument for division. Yet what’s most striking about it, at least as viewed from the perspective of contemporary American architecture, is the space for debate it has already managed to open up — and more to the point the blind spots and half-baked philosophy it has laid bare.

Sweden's Saab is particularly enthusiastic about the agreement, which may help the troubled airplane manufacturer sell some of its vaunted Gripen fighter jets. © AFP 2017/ FABRICE COFFRINI Saab Woos India With Offer to Build Fighter Jet Factory in Exchange for ContractAccording to Swedish Industry Minister Mikael Damberg, the Colombian Armed Forces are an integral part of the peaceful transition of a country scarred by a decade-long civil war, and may be making major investments in the future, the Swedish economic daily Dagens Industri reported. Sweden's Saab, which previously experienced problems trying to market its Gripen fighter jets amid heavy competition from US, EU and Russian aircraft, is pinning its hopes on Colombia's future arms procurement. Saab has previously tried to woo the Colombian military by sending Swedish military pilots and holding seminars for the Colombian Air Force. During the fifth Gripen seminar in Stockholm, Saab marketing chief Richard Smith acknowledged interest in the E/F generation of the Gripen fighter jet, following Saab's recent contract in Brazil for 36 Gripens. "We have begun to open talks with Colombia," Richard Smith said, as quoted by Swedish trade magazine Ny Teknik. In 2016, Smith identified Colombia as one of the potential buyers of the Gripen. © AP Photo/ Jeff Roberson Saab Staking on Boeing's Trainer to Boost Gripen SalesThe sale of 36 new Gripen aircraft to Brazil meant a giant step forward for the Gripen project and was described as a "game changer" by Saab. During the seminar, a hopeful Smith ventured that the Gripen will "dominate the market" for single-seat multi-role aircraft. The Gripen is currently in use in Sweden, the Czech Republic, Hungary, South Africa and Thailand. Saab is also hopeful for major deals with India and Finland, which are preparing for major air force updates with 150 and 40 jets respectively, and is also in discussion with Botswana. Previously, Saab's bids failed in Denmark, Norway, the Netherlands and Poland. In Colombia, however, Saab's marketing efforts may prove to be a bad PR move for the Swedish giant. In late 2016, Colombia signed a peace agreement after years of difficult negotiations, which earned Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos the Nobel Peace Prize. The left-wing guerilla movement FARC agreed to demobilize, but has not yet handed over their arms, whereas the second-largest guerilla force ELN has just begun peace talks. In connection with this, human rights activists believe it is the wrong time for Sweden, which previously emerged as one of the driving forces for the peace agreement, to campaign for new arms deals.

The military should be restrained, and the world should help us with that instead of trying to sell us arms," Colombian senator and human rights activist Iván Cepeda told Swedish Radio. © East News/ AP/FOTOLINK Daddy Needs a New Pair of Shoes! Saab Hopes to Flog Gripen Jets to CanadaMikael Damberg emphasized that Sweden has trained the Colombian Armed Forces exclusively in human rights and gender issues. Sweden's previous Conservative government, however, landed in hot water for helping Saab to export radar systems to Colombia. Damberg, who represents the Social Democrats, insisted that today's situation in Colombia is entirely different. "The reality has evolved since then. The way I understand it, the authorities have given the preliminary green light to the export of this type of product," Mikael Damberg told Swedish Radio. The Saab JAS 39 Gripen is a light single-engine multi-role fighter aircraft in the same class as the Eurofighter Typhoon by Airbus, the Rafale by Dassault and the Joint Strike Fighter by Lockheed Martin.   Never miss a story again — sign up to our Telegram channel and we'll keep you up to speed! ...

As our elementary and high school textbooks proudly recounted, an Agapito Flores, born in Bulacan, invented the fluorescent lamp and its very name is indelible proof of its inventor. The same textbooks claimed that a Filipino engineer, Eduardo San Juan, invented the historic vehicle that the Apollo astronauts used when they explored the moon. Years later, I would be disappointed to find out the Agapito Flores story is actually a myth. In a 2001 Inquirer piece, science writer Queena Lee-Chua wrote: ”No scientific report, no valid statement, no rigorous documents can be used to credit Flores for the discovery of the fluorescent lamp. We have tried to correct this misconception, but the media (for one) and our textbooks (for another) keep using the Flores example.” The word fluorescent, of course, comes from the Latin fluorspar (a mineral) and opalescence – not from Flores. A prototype for the fluorescent lamp was already patented by Peter Cooper in 1901 - when Agapito Flores was just four years old. The Eduardo San Juan story is a bit complicated. Lee-Chua also wrote of correspondences with NASA that yielded no mention of any Filipinos among the Boeing engineers who designed the lunar rover. Paulo Ordoveza, the longtime internet fact-checker, however, found that Eduardo San Juan was a aerospace engineer who did contribute in the design of a lunar rover - just not the one NASA used. Thus while he can be credited for being part of the pioneering age of space engineering, he cannot be called the “inventor” of the lunar rover. These factual errors notwithstanding, these “inventions” continue to circulate, in textbooks, the internet, and even in newspaper columns. What lessons can we learn from these “tales”? At the superficial level, they speak of the poor quality of our textbooks – something that crusader Antonio Go had tirelessly sought to make known to the public. As Niels Mulder wrote: “For a long period of time, and with considerable publicity, Go exposed the nonsensical material and factual inaccuracies that are densely woven into current Philippine schoolbooks…However, after fourteen years of campaigning he finally decided to throw in the towel in 2010. The quality of public education provided is apparently a trivial issue to the citizenry at large, while those who reviled him are still after his skin.” Mulder argues that these factual errors are both a cause and effect of the lack of critical thinking we need in our civic society. And this brings us to a bigger point - one that has taken on a renewed relevance in our time. Indeed, what is at stake in these inaccuracies is not just the trivial knowledge that a Filipino invented a lamp, but our capacity to collectively and individually evaluate what is factual and what is fictitious. How could it be that no one bothered to interrogate those tales that fly in the face of logic – tales that could have easily been verified? This dearth of critical thinking continues today: In the 2000s, someone concocted an etymology of the term "churva", claiming that it came from the Greek cheorvamus, defined as the “lack of the right word to say or in place of something you want to express but cannot verbalize”. But here’s the rub: there is no such term in Greek - not even a ‘V’ letter or sound in the language! The earliest references for the word comes from Filipino e-groups, and a crowdsourced Urban Dictionary entry that also came from our kabayans. Surprisingly, however, even some newspaper writers accepted the definition as true, echoing it without questioning its factualness! Is it a surprise, then, that fake news circulates today, and that misleading advertisements and false therapeutic claims do not get called out? Instead of looking at Mocha Uson as a problem in and of herself, perhaps we can (also) view her as a symptom of a deeper malady: our lack of critical thinking. – Rappler.com Gideon Lasco is a physician, medical anthropologist, and commentator on culture and current events.

The former ExxonMobil CEO has kept a very low profile since taking up his position on February 2, speaking in public only three times. He has not held a single news conference and never answers questions that reporters shout out when he is posing for photo ops with foreign counterparts. Now Tillerson has angered US and foreign correspondents accredited to cover the State Department by traveling to Asia on Tuesday with just one journalist -- from a conservative publication called the Independent Journal Review. That reporter is not a member of the group of major US and international media accredited to cover the department in charge of US diplomacy around the world. Those 15-odd reporters normally travel on the same Air Force Boeing jetliner made available for the secretary of state, with each news outlet paying its reporter's way for a seat on the aircraft. Asked why Tillerson is breaking with tradition as he traveled to Japan, South Korea and China from March 15-19, State Department spokesman Mark Toner said: "This is a chance, or an opportunity at the beginning of a new administration, to look at outside-the-box -- if I could say that -- approaches to how we cover or how we handle coverage of the secretary." "It was decided to take a journalist who was not, or from an outlet that doesn't normally travel with the secretary, as part of an effort to include a broader representation of the US media," added Toner, who also served under former president Barack Obama. Toner insisted the accredited press is not being ostracized and that the 20 or so reporters who traveled to Asia on their own to follow Tillerson would have access to him. But Toner would not say if the novel arrangement would be repeated or whether the accredited press would again be allowed to travel with the top US diplomat the next time he travels abroad. The traditional practice has been in place since the late 1960s in the interests of transparency and providing the public with important news. The State Department Correspondents' Association said it was disappointed at how the latest trip was arranged and expressed hope the department would address its concerns soon.

In a letter to Republican and Democratic leadership, the CEOs of the companies including Boeing Company, Caterpillar Inc. and General Electric Company said a border adjustment tax proposed by the Republicans would make US-manufactured products more competitive outside of the borders. They also noted that the proposal will also make imported goods face the same level of taxation at home. "If we miss this chance to fundamentally reshape the tax code, it might take another 30 years before we have another chance to try," the letter said.   Earlier, Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan proposed to decrease the corporate income tax to 20 percent from the current 35 percent. This will impose a 20 percent tax on imports and exclude export revenue from taxable income. Media reports say, the proposed code has pitted large US corporations which require imports against the corporations that export much of their products. Last week, a group of retail CEOs met with President Donald Trump and congressional leaders to discuss the negative impacts of the border adjustment tax on their products. Trump is set to publish his tax proposal in the next couple of weeks. He has said the border adjustment tax is too "complicated". His administration has said taxing goods from Mexico could fund construction of a wall along the nation's southern border. Trump has already set in motion his plan to build an "impenetrable” border wall between the US and Mexico. The border is about 3,100 km long and traverses all sorts of terrain. Trump says the wall will cover 1,000 miles and natural obstacles will take care of the rest.             Loading ...   News Iran Middle East US UK Asia-Pacific Africa Europe Americas Society Arts Business Sports Video News Bulletin Reports Interviews TV Watch Live Schedule Shows Documentaries PressTV About PressTV Frequencies Privacy Policy Contact Info SMS Subscribe PressTV © Copyright 2016 PressTV.

Tags china military advanced technology World Espionage risk to US heightened as China's military presses its domestic tech firms CNBC | Jeff Daniels | Thursday, Mar 16, 2017 China's President Xi Jinping made an address to the country's national legislature where he urged the People's Liberation Army "to speed up" the application of advanced technologies. Photo: Reuters Jeff Daniels CNBC Thursday, Mar 16, 2017 China is taking a page from the Pentagon's playbook under the Obama administration: it's partnering with tech companies to develop more cutting-edge weapons. But China's innovation-focused strategy could elevate the espionage risk to the US Ironically, this new threat emerges as the Trump administration is expected to slow its outreach to the tech firms. Over the weekend, Chinese President Xi Jinping made an address to the country's national legislature where he urged the People's Liberation Army "to speed up" the application of advanced technologies, according to the Chinese military's official web portal. Jinping sees "integrated military and civilian development" as one of the drivers of science-tech innovation and key to upgrading China's military capabilities. "If you were to look at reports like Chinese military power over time, it's obvious that China is closing the gap more quickly than, for example, we probably would have estimated five or three years ago," said Anthony Cordesman, a national security expert and Arleigh A. Burke Chair in Strategy at the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank in Washington, D.C. The communist nation's military has made major technology strides in the past decade in missile, laser weapon, advanced sensor and stealth aircraft development with the help of Chinese firms in the civilian sector. Its rapidly developing missile technology is seen by some as a potential threat to the West. Other major strides have been made in stealth aircraft design and follow what's believed to be state-sponsored cyber and industrial espionage. "China's overall effort toward civil-military integration will provide great benefits to China's already very aggressive espionage programs," said Richard Fisher, a senior fellow on Asian military affairs at the International Assessment and Strategy Center in Alexandria, Virginia. According to Fisher, the close ties between military development and the civilian side of China's economy "is one of the highest policies" of the central government in Beijing. As an example, China's president was named earlier this year to chair a new central commission to promote this effort. There are "vast new incentives as well as requirements for the actors in the civilian economy to come up with ways to examine anything innovative that they come up with that can be applied to the military," Fisher said. A year ago, a Chinese national identified as "a businessman in the aviation and aerospace fields" pleaded guilty in the US to participating in a conspiracy to hack into computer networks of major American defence contractors to steal military and export-controlled data. Court documents show the conspiracy group's targets included the Boeing C-17 military cargo aircraft as well as Lockheed Martin's F-22 and F-35 fighters. "It's fairly obvious from patterns of industrial espionage that it isn't always the government which has been, for example, seeking data on defence activities in the United States and Europe," said Cordesman. He added that in some cases it appears "to be people with some kind of private sector or industrial ties." Experts say the espionage organs in China set the priorities and come up with lists of targets. If a civilian company offers possible linkages to military companies, then the espionage leadership is likely to pursue those leads. China's major investment in its military comes at a time when President Donald Trump also is calling for "one of the largest increases in national defence spending in American history." Trump had previously been critical of the Obama administration for "deep cuts in our military, which only invite more aggression from our adversaries." Given Trump's animosity to former President Barack Obama's policies, it's probably no surprise that the billionaire president has shied away from endorsing the past administration's so-called Third Offset concept, an innovation push and outreach to Silicon Valley firms. The initiative was designed under Ashton Carter, the former Defence secretary, to promote cutting-edge tech innovation and give the Pentagon more expertise outside the traditional defence industrial sector. However, one Pentagon official who was hired in the Obama administration said this week during a South by Southwest panel in Austin, Texas, that the military needs to work and learn from the non-defence side. "Once we have those bridges built, we're going to have to keep them strong and treat them as a strategic resource," Will Roper, the director of the Pentagon's Strategic Capabilities Office, said during a Wired panel at SXSW on Monday. Roper, who has held the post since 2012, indicated that the US military's learning could include something as basic as a better understanding of total logistics from a package delivery company or capabilities in development by major tech firms. Even so, Trump's Defence Secretary James Mattis - a retired Marine general - appears more focused these days in the nuts and bolts of military readiness rather than an outreach to tech. To be clear, China's outreach to the civilian side is broader than the Obama administration's Third Offset, which included setting up so-called Defence Innovation Unit Experimental (or DIUx) tech hubs in Silicon Valley, Austin and Boston. China's military-civilian industry efforts include working in at least eight regions of the country with companies engaged in everything from advanced chip production and information technology to aerospace manufacturing. One area where DIUx could make a major difference is helping the US military develop technology to better protect against cyber attacks and breaches from adversaries such as China and Russia. The rapid development of stealth fighter aircraft by China's military coincided with reports back in 2009 of a cyber breach of sensitive national security information from Lockheed's F-35 Joint Strike Fighter programme. The F-35 stealth fighter is the Pentagon's costliest weapons programme and includes the acquisition of aircraft for all three of the US military services. Foreign allies such as Japan, the UK, Italy, Israel and others also are participating in buying the aircraft. "China has already copied major sub-systems for the F-35, especially its advanced optical detection systems, which until recently helped give it a major combat advantage," said Fisher. "These optical systems appear to now be in production in China." As a result, Fisher expects the overall advantage the F-35 will give American and allied forces will be "much less" over time than might have been originally anticipated. Several reports last week indicated that China's new J-20 stealth fighter entered into service, a major milestone for China's military. The J-20 resembles the F-22 Raptor air-to-air combat aircraft introduced into the US Air Force in 2005. Also, China's smaller stealth fighter called the FC-31 Gyrfalcon in development is seen as a knockoff of the F-35. Then again, some observers suggest even the Russians have had their Su-35 Flanker fighter copied by Chinese state-owned firms. Sign up for our e-newsletter now!

(NASA / SSAI Photo / Edward Winstead) A NASA-led study demonstrates that airplanes powered by biofuels can emit up to 70 percent less particulate pollution – providing a potential boost for technologies that are being pioneered at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport. The study, published today by the journal Nature, was conducted in the skies over NASA’s Armstrong Flight Research Center in California. But the findings could be applied at Sea-Tac, where the Port of Seattle, Alaska Airlines and Boeing are partnering to work toward having biofuel available for every flight. NASA’s flight tests in 2013 and 2014 were part of a series of experiments known as the Alternative Fuel Effects on Contrails and Cruise Emissions Study, or ACCESS. Researchers wanted to find out whether biofuels had an effect on the formation of contrails, the cloudy trails that are produced when the hot exhaust of a jet engine mixes with cold air at high altitudes. Persistent contrails can evolve into long-lived clouds that wouldn’t form otherwise, affecting atmospheric conditions. During the flight tests, NASA flew its DC-8 research jet to altitudes as high as 40,000 feet. The biofuel was a 50-50 blend of traditional Jet A aviation fuel and an alternative fuel produced from camelina plant oil. Three other aircraft took turns flying behind the four-engine DC-8, at distances ranging from 300 feet to more than 20 miles away, to measure the emissions and study contrail formation. “This was the first time we have quantified the amount of soot particles emitted by jet engines while burning a 50-50 blend of biofuel in flight,” Rich Moore, lead author of the Nature report, said in a NASA news release. Previous tests have been done with engines on the ground. The study determined that particle emissions were reduced by 50 to 70 percent at cruise conditions, compared with the emissions from straight Jet A fuel. The reduction was less pronounced at high-thrust settings than at low to medium thrust. Bruce Anderson, ACCESS project scientist at NASA’s Langley Research Center, said soot emissions are a major determining factor for the formation of contrails and their properties. “As a result, the observed particle reductions we’ve measured during ACCESS should directly translate into reduced ice crystal concentrations in contrails, which in turn should help minimize their impact on Earth’s environment,” Anderson said. In their Nature paper, the researchers noted that it’s complicated to gauge the total effect on contrails: Although the ice crystal concentrations should be reduced, the frequency and ice mass of contrails may actually increase due to the higher hydrogen content in the biofuel blend.

The only other government contractor with the required certification to launch the satellite — United Launch Alliance (ULA), a joint venture between Boeing and Lockheed Martin — did not bid on the contract. It’s the second launch contract SpaceX has received from the Pentagon and is a big shakeup for the defense industry. ULA had been providing these services for more than a decade without competition. • The National Institutes of Health awarded Westat Inc. a contract worth up to $16.8 million to “collect, process and analyze data” in an agency effort to examine links between various types of infections and cancer. The end goal is to be able to better screen for and prevent these kinds of cancers. “Since cancers that are caused by infections typically occur with greater frequency in the developing world,” contract documents say, the work requires contractors to assist researchers internationally. ADVERTISEMENT • Three different U.S. embassies around the world are getting new furniture, thanks to a new set of State Department contract awards. Each of the stores chosen by the State Department were done so without a competitive bid process for reasons including wanting to match the furniture and decor already at each compound. For example, luxury brand Summer Classics won a $117,000 contract to provide outdoor furniture for the chief of mission residence in Praia, Cape Verde. Another contract will pay Supplies Express $56,000 for outdoor teak furniture and trash cans for a compound in Karachi, Pakistan. The deputy chief of mission residence in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, got $28,500 worth of updated furniture from Heritage Home.  • The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service awarded a seven-month contract, worth up to $936,900, for the “daily air cargo transport of biological material from Guatemala to the United States and the Dominican Republic.” Air Freight & Services in Guatemala won the contract. Contract documents are not more specific about what is being transported. Contract information compiled from General Services Administration data and government press releases.

Marathon legacy runner Ann Tack McClure holds some of her medals from previous L.A. Marathons near her home in San Clemente. McClure has run has run all 31 L.A. Marathons and 68 marathons overall. (Photo by Jeff Antenore, Contributing Photographer) By JEFF MILLER / STAFF COLUMNIST Facebook Twitter Email Comments PRINT SEND PDF SAN CLEMENTE – She began more than 40 years ago, motivated to lose 15 pounds and perhaps fight off the same osteoporosis that had affected her mother. Ann Tack McClure was only running in circles back then, quite literally, on the track Rockwell-Boeing had installed for its employees. “A girlfriend of mine had just done her first marathon,” Tack McClure recalled this week. “I thought, ‘Jeez, maybe I could do one.’ So I did and enjoyed it. I did pretty good, too. So, I just kept going.” Boy, did she ever, this now 72-year-old the personification of the marathon, an event that is best devoured one stride and then one mile at a time or, in the case of a real distance runner, one year and then one decade at a time. On Sunday, Tack McClure hopes to finish what would be her 32nd consecutive L.A. Marathon. That’s every L.A. Marathon to date, a former analyst on the space shuttle program maybe the ideal candidate to shoot for the outer limits of man- and womankind alike. Tack McClure is an L.A. legacy runner, one of only 19 females still in this race, “legacy runner” being the term used to identify those individuals disciplined enough, stubborn enough, wacko enough to never miss. The achievement is not unlike what comparably persistent athletes have done in other sports. Just picture Cal Ripken Jr., only with his knee cartilage worn away about a thousand miles ago. “Before I knew it, they were adding up,” Tack McClure said. “It was five. It was 10. It was 15. I thought, ‘OK, I have to keep going.’ ” And isn’t that what the most determined of marathoners do? Keep going? Despite a lifetime supply of shin splints? Bouts of plantar fasciitis? A meniscus tear that Tack McClure’s doctor recently informed her was “chronic?” Of course, it is, the marathon a test of not only the soles but also the soul, Tack McClure completing L.A. one year even though she was still recovering from a back injury and another year after being diagnosed with breast cancer. She underwent surgery and 32 rounds of radiation in 2005 and then, at age 61, returned to finish L.A. in four hours, 10 minutes, 31 minutes faster than the previous year. She finished second in her age group. That’s another thing the most determined of marathoners do - keep going even when their bodies might be in favor of any other alternative, up to and including never leaving bed. This year, Tack McClure’s knee has forced her to train more on an exercise bike and has prevented her, as a precaution, from running any other marathons. She also just had a cortisone shot. Then again, if being a “legacy runner” was easy, they wouldn't make a point to empathize the word “leg” right there in the name. “I’ll go out there and do one mile at a time and see how it goes,” she said. “If it comes to the point where I’m in so much pain that I have to stop, I’ll say, ‘Well, this is the end of my legacy.’ Hopefully, that won’t happen.” This will be Tack McClure’s 69th marathon overall. She has done Boston twice and four times has completed the annual event on Catalina Island, a race quite popular among runners, particularly those who enjoy hairy hills and quad-scorching torture. She clearly has run enough for more than one person, which is fitting since she isn’t running for just herself. Tack McClure has raised nearly $100,000 for various charities over the years, her favorite being St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital. (To donate to her latest effort, visit http://heroes.stjude.org/legacy.) She typically has been drawn to causes for kids, starting with the Amie Karen Cancer Fund for Children, an admirable endeavor for a woman with no children of her own. “When I see their pictures and I see them suffering, it’s sad,” she explained. “Some of these kids have their lives snuffed out so early but others are saved. It’s just a special thing for me.” On Sunday, Tack McClure’s support group will include her husband Steve and her brothers, Dan and Andy, along with their significant others, JoAnn Tack and Judy Chocek. Her friends Bob and Carla Raney are also planning to attend. The group will be waiting at the finish line near the Santa Monica Pier, Tack McClure pretty sure she’ll do what she does when seeing them there every year. She figures she’ll start crying again. “The feeling of making that turn onto Ocean (Avenue), knowing that my family is there, is just ... you know, it’s just emotional,” she said. “It’s just a good feeling. It’s kind of hard to explain.” But it certainly isn’t hard to understand, even non-runners able to appreciate the commitment and passion of a marathoner who has gone the distance.

[Shutterstock - Andrey_Popov - 360067064]    33 Million Records From Gov’t Departments, Corporations Leaked Eric Lieberman Tech and Law Reporter 7:48 PM 03/15/2017      Pinterest  Reddit  LinkedIn  WhatsApp     Share         TOP 5535206 More than 33 million records from various corporations and government agencies were leaked recently, after researchers discovered the information was quietly made available to the public. Organizations with the most files exposed are the Department of Defense, with 101,013 employee records, and the U.S. Postal Service with 88,153, according to ZDNet. The U.S. Army, Air Force, and the Department of Veterans Affairs reportedly had a combined 76,379 records exposed. Businesses affected by the breach include AT&T, Dell, Xerox, IBM, FedEx, and Boeing. Unique email addresses and other personal contact information were leaked, but it is not exactly yet known how the data was revealed or who is the culprit, reports ZDNet. The large database was owned by Dun & Bradsheet, a business services conglomerate. It sells the information to advertisers who want to directly target specific industries and people. Marketers will pay substantial amounts of money for an organization’s data, specifically the names of employees, phone numbers, job titles, duties, and work email addresses. (RELATED: There Are At Least 170 Million Internet-Connected Devices Susceptible To Hacking In The U.S.) “We’ve carefully evaluated the information that was shared with us and it is of a type and in a format that we deliver to customers every day,” Dun & Bradstreet said in an official statement, reports ZDNet. “Based on our analysis, it was not accessed or exposed through a Dun & Bradstreet system.” While the company is reportedly taking the issue seriously, it is also arguing that the severity of the incident is not as exceptional as it may first appear because the data contains “generally publicly available business contact data, used for sales and marketing purposes.” But Troy Hunt, who runs a breach notification site, says that gaining such information can be very valuable for phishing scams. Phishing is the attempt to acquire sensitive data (like credit card numbers, usernames, passwords, social security numbers) for nefarious reasons by tricking unsuspecting users to click on infected links. (RELATED: Hackers Are Gunning For Your Personal Data By Tricking You) “The value for very targeted spear phishing is enormous because you can carefully craft messages that refer to specific individuals of influence and their roles within the organisation,” Hunt wrote on a blog post. “For example, sending a message on behalf of the ‘Vice President, Senior Private Banker’ (her name is easily discoverable) to an accountant in the firm requesting an urgent transfer.” Hunt states that while much of the information can be found with a moderate amount of browsing, “having so much of it in one place enables the automation of attacks across a broad range of organisations (emphasis his).” As for workers who want to make sure their data is no longer exposed on the internet, Hunt says there is “next to zero” of a chance.

(Aaron Rosenblatt/Daily Republic) Fairfield Flying Fortress brings special history to Nut Tree By Todd R. Hansen From page A1 | March 17, 2017 VACAVILLE — The original B-17 Aluminum Overcast did not see the end of World War II, and its namesake never got into the war. But the version brought this week to Vacaville by the Experimental Aircraft Association, which came off the assembly line May 18, 1945, and declared surplus in 1946, carries with it the history of a plane that came to be known as the Flying Fortress. Fairfield’s own Ret. Col. Robert “Sully” Sullivan, 100, piloted a B-17 during such historic battles as Guadalcanal and Midway as a member of the 431st Bombardment Squadron of the 11th Bomb Group of the U.S. Army Air Corp. Sullivan flew 126 missions, including two at Midway, 95 in the South Pacific and 29 in China – almost all in the durable bomber. The China missions were in a B-29. His first B-17 was called the Yankee Doodle Jr. “(The B-17) was a real stable airplane and took a lot of punishment and still got us there,” Sullivan said in an interview last fall. He remembers returning from a number of missions with the plane riddled by flak. An EAA crew took media representatives up in the plane Thursday as a promotion for its stay at the Nut Tree Airport over the weekend, where for a fee, anyone interested can take a flight. Ground tours also will be available through Sunday, also for a fee. “This is the laboratory where we learned about high-altitude aviation,” said John Bode, who piloted the Aluminum Overcast on a 20-minute flight over Vacaville and the surrounding rural areas. Its maximum altitude during the war was just higher than 34,000 feet. The plane never exceeded 1,500 feet during the press flight, but that was high enough for An’Jurhee Simons, with Salem Media, who was singularly the most nervous passenger on the plane. “I’m getting better,” she said as the plane finally lifted off. Up until then, and especially during takeoff, she had a death grip on the seatbelt straps, her breathing was labored and, in the end, she simply sank lower into the makeshift seat and closed her eyes. Simons eventually gained enough courage to unbuckle her belt and stand, walking to the front of the aircraft where she got the pilot’s view of the area. It was worth the nerves. “To see what they see, that made it all worthwhile,” Simons said when back safely on the ground. The plane is a Boeing B-17 Model G, one of 8,860 produced. In all, there were 12,732 B-17s produced during World War II. There are 13 that are still flying, according to the EAA. And while it has the Boeing name, it was actually made by Vega Aircraft, Bode said in a preflight chat. Bode tried to paint a picture of what it must have been like to be a young man who was part of a B-17 crew during the war. Aviation was still in its infancy, and while they received the best training possible, no one had experience with the kind of long-range missions the plane was being asked to perform. It was also worth noting, Bode said, that in the early part of the war, one out of every three bombers who took off never came home – each carrying a crew of 10. The 8th Air Force, Bode said, lost more airmen than the Marines did in the Pacific Theater. Bode also made it quite clear that the people building those planes – as well as the Jeeps and trucks and tanks and all sorts of military equipment – were the women who took over the factory jobs. This particular bomber had a life as a cargo hauler, aerial mapping platform and pest control duster before it was bought and restored in 1978. It was donated to the Experimental Aircraft Association in 1983 and made over to look like the original Aluminum Overcast, which was shot down over France on Aug. 13, 1944. It has been used for these kinds of tour flights since 1994. Reach Todd R. Hansen at 427-6932 or [email protected] . More information The Aluminum Overcast will be available for flights from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. Friday through Sunday. Ground tours will be available from 2 to 5 p.m. each day. For ticket prices, go to B17.org or call 1-800-359-6217.

Business Home LBoard No Federal Court road trip for peninsula appeals, says Arifin V Anbalagan Read More FMT BAHASA FMT BORNEO+ FMT VIDEO CONTRIBUTE NEWS HOME NATION OPINION WORLD LEISURE SPORTS BUSINESS ADVERTISE WITH US Trump’s budget cuts to domestic, aid programs draw Republican scorn Reuters | March 17, 2017 Conservatives have plenty to like in the White House plan, with its 10% increase in military spending next year and beefed-up funding to help deport more illegal immigrants and build a wall on the border with Mexico. WASHINGTON: President Donald Trump’s first budget outline, calling for a security-heavy realignment of federal spending, drew resistance on Thursday from his fellow Republicans in the U.S. Congress as many balked at proposed deep cuts to diplomatic and foreign aid programs. Conservatives have plenty to like in the White House plan, with its 10 percent increase in military spending next year and beefed-up funding to help deport more illegal immigrants and build a wall on the border with Mexico. It also takes steps to downsize government, a central goal of conservatives. But the gaze into Trump’s priorities for the next four years proved too savage for many Republicans’ taste, foreshadowing an intense battle between Congress and the White House over spending in coming months. Although Republicans control both the Senate and House of Representatives, Congress holds the federal purse strings and seldom approves presidents’ budget plans. The administration asked Congress for a 28%, or $10.9 billion, cut in State Department funding and other international programs to help pay for a 10%, $54 billion hike in military spending next year. “These increases in defense come at the expense of national security,” said Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, who has not hesitated to take on Trump. Republican Senator Marco Rubio, who like Graham ran unsuccessfully for president in 2016, leveled similar sentiments, as did some prominent Republicans in the House of Representatives. House Speaker Paul Ryan sidestepped reporters’ questions about whether he supported State Department cuts, saying the White House blueprint was just the start of the budget process. The budget also drew criticism internationally. The French ambassador to the United Nations, Francois Delattre, warned that cutting funding of global programs could fuel instability. Election Promises The White House shrugged off concerns about the impact, saying Trump was making good on election promises. “The president said, specifically, hundreds of times – you covered him – ‘I’m going to spend less money on people overseas and more money on people back home’ and that’s exactly what we’re doing with this budget,” Trump’s budget director, Mick Mulvaney, told reporters. Democrats, whose votes would be needed later this year to sign off on the spending bills that implement any budget blueprint given the slim Republican hold on the Senate, attacked the proposed reductions to the Environmental Protection Agency and programs that benefit the poor. The White House proposal would inflict a 31%, or $2.6 billion, cut on the EPA. Some veteran Republicans, including Senator Rob Portman of Ohio, a White House budget chief during the administration of President George W. Bush, vowed to preserve the EPA’s Great Lakes restoration program that Trump wants to eliminate. Moderate Republicans expressed unease with potential cuts to popular domestic programs. Lisa Murkowski, who chairs the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, attacked plans to cut or eliminate programs that help the poor pay heating bills, provide aid for localities to deal with wastewater and subsidize air travel in rural areas like her home state of Alaska. “We need to remember that these programs are not the primary drivers of our debt,” Murkowski said. In fact, those “discretionary” programs that must be renewed annually by Congress, account for about $1.2 trillion out of a $3.9 trillion federal budget. The biggest portion of the budget – about $2.4 trillion – is for “mandatory entitlement” programs that provide Social Security retirement benefits and Medicare and Medicaid healthcare for the elderly, poor and disabled. Conservatives have been clamoring for years for reforms to those programs to save money. Trump vowed, however, to protect them as he campaigned for president last year. Trump was silent on those programs in the plan released on Thursday, but they will be included in a fuller fiscal blueprint due out in mid-May that will project spending and revenues over 10 years. It is unclear if any reforms for those programs will be part of that budget. Other discretionary cuts proposed by Trump included community development grants at the Housing Department and more than 20 Education Department programs. Funding would disappear for 19 independent bodies that count on federal money for public broadcasting, the arts and regional programs. “Throwing billions at defense while ransacking America’s investments in jobs, education, clean energy and lifesaving medical research will leave our nation weakened,” said House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi. Defense money for current year Trump also asked for $25 billion more for core Defense Department programs for the current fiscal year, as well as $5 billion more for combat operations. A detailed copy of that request seen by Reuters showed some of the funds would be for procurement of technology such as F-35 fighter aircraft and drone systems. About $13.5 billion of the supplemental request was earmarked for aircraft, missiles and ships. It included THAAD missiles, Blackhawk helicopters and F-35s made by Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N), as well as F/A-18 warplanes and Apache helicopters manufactured by Boeing Co (BA.N). Also for this fiscal year, Trump requested $3 billion more for the Department of Homeland Security, with some of that money intended for planning and construction of the border wall that he made a major part of his 2016 election campaign. Congress will likely consider the supplemental request by April 28, when regular funding expires for most federal agencies. The budget outline also does not incorporate Trump’s plan for sparking $1 trillion in investments to build roads, bridges, airports and other infrastructure projects. The White House has said the infrastructure plan is still to come. The planned defense increases are mainly matched by cuts to other programs so as to not increase the $488 billion federal deficit. Despite the proposed big cuts to the EPA and the State Department, Mulvaney said their “core functions” would be preserved. Reflecting Trump’s repeated election campaign pledge to reduce illegal immigration, the Department of Homeland Security would get a 6.8% increase, with more money for extra staff needed to catch, detain and deport illegal immigrants. Trump wants Congress to approve $1.5 billion for the border wall in the current fiscal year – enough for pilot projects to determine the best way to build it – and a further $2.6 billion in fiscal 2018, Mulvaney said. The estimate for the total cost of the wall will be included in the upcoming full budget. Trump has repeatedly said that Mexico will pay for the wall. Mexico has adamantly said it will not. Since Trump took office in January, the White House has said funding would be kick-started in the United States.

Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds. Photos: 7 terrifying airplane seat patents Is this the future of flying? – With airlines under pressure to slash fares and cram in ever more people without extending cabin space, passengers might soon be stacked on top of each other -- literally. This is our hellish version. Click on to see what real aviation engineers are coming up with. Hide Caption 1 of 9 Photos: 7 terrifying airplane seat patents New Airbus patent – Airbus has offered a chilling glimpse into what the future of air travel might hold with a patent that envisages two rows of seats layered on top of each other. The patent states that the design "still provides a high level of comfort for the passengers" with seats that could be reclined 180 degrees. Hide Caption 2 of 9 Photos: 7 terrifying airplane seat patents Airbus saddle seat – At least with the stacked-rows design passengers will actually be sitting down. Not so much with the so-called saddle seat, another Airbus patent, which would require them to assume a semi-squat position during a flight. Hide Caption 3 of 9 Photos: 7 terrifying airplane seat patents Saddle up – The seat (our imagined version shown here), which wouldn't look out of place on a bicycle, has no headrest, with back support also in limited supply. The patent admits that the increase in the number of seats is achieved to the detriment of the comfort of the passengers. Hide Caption 4 of 9 Photos: 7 terrifying airplane seat patents Abandoned Ryanair proposal – Fully-standing spaces were proposed by Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary a few years ago, although they haven't been rolled out. "We have no plans to trial or introduce standing flights," an airline spokesperson told CNN. If our rendition is even close to accurate, that's a good thing.

Or so we imagine here.

Its purpose is to help passengers rest during a flight by letting them lean face-forward into a cushion that has a hole to accommodate eyes, nose and mouth.

Hide Caption 9 of 9 (CNN)You know that blissful feeling when you finally sit back in your airplane seat, giddy with the anticipation of being served delectable dishes on your way to an exotic destination? Us neither. And with airlines under pressure to slash fares and cram in ever more people without extending cabin space, passengers might soon be stacked on top of each other -- literally. Airbus has offered a chilling glimpse into what the future of air travel might hold with a patent that envisages two rows of seats layered on top of each other. The patent states that the design "still provides a high level of comfort for the passengers" and seats could be reclined 180 degrees. Read More "There are myriad concerns when looking at this design, chiefly whether or not passengers would be able to evacuate in 90 seconds," says Mary Kirby, editor of Runway Girl Network aviation news website. The time frame is a regulatory requirement set out by the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration. Kirby adds that the concept also doesn't take passengers with disability into consideration, or pregnant women who might struggle to climb to the top level. Midflight squat But at least with this design passengers will actually be sitting down. Not so much with the so-called saddle seat, another Airbus patent, which would require them to assume a semi-squat position during a flight. The seat, which wouldn't look out of place on a bicycle, has no headrest, with back support also limited. The designers are under no illusion that this would make for a pleasant traveling experience. The patent states that the increase in the number of seats is achieved to the detriment of the comfort of the passengers, but does offer these words of solace: "This remains tolerable for the passengers inasmuch as the flight lasts only one or a few hours." However, it's still a notch up from the fully standing spaces proposed by Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary a few years ago. The budget airline's CEO took the no-frills concept to another level by suggesting passengers could be transported to their destination strapped in to a standing position for between $6 and $13. Ryanair seems to have abandoned the idea for now. "We have no plans to trial or introduce standing flights," a spokesperson tells CNN. The nightmare of standing flights is likely a long way off. Even so, we can't stop our imaginations. Eye to eye Those for whom flying means getting lost in a book or film while politely ignoring their neighbors probably won't enjoy the designs from Zodiac Seats France. Its Economy Class Cabin Hexagon consists of a tightly packed jigsaw of alternating backward and forward seats, making it difficult to maintain the number one rule of traveling on any form of public transport -- avoiding eye contact. Not to be outdone, Boeing has filed its share of eccentric patents, such as their "upright sleep support system." Its purpose is to help passengers rest during a flight by letting them lean face-forward into a cushion that has a hole to accommodate eyes, nose and mouth. Another cushion supports the chest and both are deployed from a backpack attached to the seat. Passengers may, however, run the risk of looking like they've overindulged in inflight alcohol. All in your head? If the grim reality of air travel is too much to handle, why not escape your surroundings with the help of a sensory helmet? The Airbus-patented headwear could isolate passengers from sound, sight, smell -- or all three at once -- for a more pleasant and relaxing journey. Presumably this would come in handy if the person in front has lowered the back of their seat and the baby next to you has just had an accident. The science fiction-like helmet would fit in with the company's vision for the airplane of the future, which might look like a donut if Airbus has its way. The patent for its futuristic-shaped aircraft looks like the plane is hoisting the popular pastry on its back, complete with a hole in the middle. According to Airbus, this configuration can fit more passengers and distribute cabin pressure more evenly. JUST WATCHED Would you ride in a 'flying doughnut'? Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Would you ride in a 'flying doughnut'? 03:00 (Un)real prospects Fliers can breathe a sigh of relief when it comes to some of the more outlandish patents -- they'll likely never see the light of day. Airbus says that its latest stacked seats design is just one of several hundred they publish each year. "We do this to protect our ideas, but many of these never actually develop beyond concept stages," says Robert Gage, head of media relations for Airbus in the United Kingdom. "This is all part of intellectual property strategy at play -- the seat and aircraft makers are trying to cover themselves for the future, which is unknown, and the regulations of the future which are also unknown," says Mary Kirby. However, Kirby says that airlines' trend toward stripping their service to the bone is pushing the boundaries of what travelers will accept. "Passengers are really starting to get more vocal," she says. "You do wonder when we will reach the tipping point and it gets so uncomfortable that there's going to be serious backlash."

Culture Secretary Karen Bradley has past the buck of 21st Century Fox's proposed takeover of Sky over to the regulators. Whether they like it or not, their decisions on it will be seen as political  James Moore Chief Business Commentator @JimMooreJourno Thursday 16 March 2017 16:52 GMT Click to follow The Independent Online In the hotseat: Sharon White will have to decide if Fox is a fit and proper owner of Sky In reality, Culture Secretary Karen Bradley didn’t have much choice but to refer 21st Century Fox’s bid to take full control of Sky to Ofcom and the Competition & Markets Authority.  Imagine the row if she hadn't. Even her predecessor John Whittingdale, who was open about his support for Fox chairman Rupert Murdoch, wouldn't have risked waving it through.  Kicking it over to the regulator provides the minister with cover. The fact that it’s the right decision is just gravy.  Read more Murdoch’s Sky takeover bid to be examined by regulators Sky presenter Dermot Murnaghan injured in alleged 'hit and run' Rupert Murdoch moves one step closer to full takeover of Sky So let’s consider what the two regulators, which will have been expecting to get this biggest of bucks passed to them, have to deal with. In a sense, the job of the Competition & Markets Authority is the easier one. Does the bid reduce competition in a highly concentrated media market to an unacceptable degree? The Murdochs will point to the rise of interest broadcasters such as Netflix  and Amazon, which didn’t exist the last time we went through this.  Then there is the growing power of Facebook, which is rapidly becoming the younger generation’s favoured news portal and is increasingly used by their parents.  They’ll also argue that their print businesses have been spun off from their broadcasting interests, and that both companies have independent shareholders, and non executive directors.  So, no problem for the Competition regulators? Come off it. The many critics of this deal, who all but forced Ms Bradley’s hand, will start off with the fact that the 22m customer strong Sky remains Britain’s monopoly satellite broadcaster.  They may also point to the fact that, despite the separation of the print and broadcast businesses, and all those independent shareholders and directors, what the Murdochs want, they usually get. So how will the CMA treat the issue of control?  It has to advise on whether to bring Europe in, but whatever it does, the decision will be seen as political. Fox says there’s not an issue. Its critics say there is. The CMA has an established framework to use in making its judgement, but whichever way its advice falls, it’s going still to make people very cross.  However, the hot the potato that has just landed in its lap courtesy of Ms Bradley? It’s an ice lollipop when compared to what Ofcom has to deal with.  Having resolved, for the moment, the ongoing debate over the future of BT’s broadband network with a slightly messy compromise, it now has this. Ofcom's lot is not a happy one.  If there is one top regulator who can be said to earn their inflated salary, it’s Ofcom chief Sharon White. Even Andrew Bailey’s job at the Financial Conduct Authority looks tame by comparison.  Ms Bradley has to decide whether Fox is a fit owner for Sky in the wake of phone hacking, and the governance issues that have cropped up at the business.  Business picture of the day 38 show all Business picture of the day 1/38 'UK Disneyland' set to open in five years in Kent - Friday March 10 It’s the news British film-lovers and thrill-seekers have been waiting to hear forever - no longer do we have to schlep across the seas to get our fix of stardust and adrenaline, for the UK is finally getting its own ‘Disneyland’.

The partnership, which is owned by its employees, reduced the bonus to 6 per cent of salaries making it the lowest since 1954. It is the fourth year in a row that the payment has been cut. Pre-tax profits rose 21.2 per cent to £370.4m as overall sales rose 3.2 per cent but the group said it cut staff bonuses because of an “increasingly uncertain” market.

The Government came under fire last year after it announced that targets for plastic recycling would be reduced from 57 per cent to a mere 49 per cent for 2016 and then increased by 2 per cent each year to 2020, to a maximum of 57 per cent by 2020. AFP/Getty 7/38 Inflation hits 1.8% as post-Brexit pound weakness feeds through to high street - Tuesday February 14 UK consumer price inflation jumped to 1.8 per cent in the year to January, from a rise of 1.6 per cent in the year to December, as the slump in the pound since the Brexit referendum continued to trickle through to the high street. According to data from the Office for National Statistics published on Tuesday, January’s rise was the biggest since June 2014. But the jump narrowly missed analyst expectations for a 1.9 per cent increase, just below the Bank of England’s official 2 per cent target.

In its latest Inflation Report, the Bank upgraded its 2017 GDP growth forecast to 2 per cent, up from 1.4 per cent in November. The revision is certain to be seized upon by Brexiteers as evidence that the economy will not suffer from leaving the European Union and that previous economic warnings from the Bank have now been exposed as scaremongering. Yet the Bank’s forecasts continue to project a growth slowdown in 2018 and 2019, with GDP expected to expand by 1.6 per cent and 1.7 per cent in those years.

Republican Senator Marco Rubio, who like Graham ran unsuccessfully for president in 2016, leveled similar sentiments, as did some prominent Republicans in the House of Representatives.House Speaker Paul Ryan sidestepped reporters' questions about whether he supported State Department cuts, saying the White House blueprint was just the start of the budget process.The budget also drew criticism internationally. The French ambassador to the United Nations, Francois Delattre, warned that cutting funding of global programs could fuel instability.ELECTION PROMISES The White House shrugged off concerns about the impact, saying Trump was making good on election promises."The president said, specifically, hundreds of times - you covered him - 'I'm going to spend less money on people overseas and more money on people back home' and that's exactly what we're doing with this budget," Trump's budget director, Mick Mulvaney, told reporters. Democrats, whose votes would be needed later this year to sign off on the spending bills that implement any budget blueprint given the slim Republican hold on the Senate, attacked the proposed reductions to the Environmental Protection Agency and programs that benefit the poor.The White House proposal would inflict a 31 percent, or $2.6 billion, cut on the EPA.Some veteran Republicans, including Senator Rob Portman of Ohio, a White House budget chief during the administration of President George W. Bush, vowed to preserve the EPA's Great Lakes restoration program that Trump wants to eliminate.Moderate Republicans expressed unease with potential cuts to popular domestic programs.Lisa Murkowski, who chairs the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, attacked plans to cut or eliminate programs that help the poor pay heating bills, provide aid for localities to deal with wastewater and subsidize air travel in rural areas like her home state of Alaska."We need to remember that these programs are not the primary drivers of our debt," Murkowski said.In fact, those "discretionary" programs that must be renewed annually by Congress, account for about $1.2 trillion out of a $3.9 trillion federal budget. The biggest portion of the budget - about $2.4 trillion - is for "mandatory entitlement" programs that provide Social Security retirement benefits and Medicare and Medicaid healthcare for the elderly, poor and disabled.Conservatives have been clamoring for years for reforms to those programs to save money. Trump vowed, however, to protect them as he campaigned for president last year.Trump was silent on those programs in the plan released on Thursday, but they will be included in a fuller fiscal blueprint due out in mid-May that will project spending and revenues over 10 years. It is unclear if any reforms for those programs will be part of that budget.Other discretionary cuts proposed by Trump included community development grants at the Housing Department and more than 20 Education Department programs. Funding would disappear for 19 independent bodies that count on federal money for public broadcasting, the arts and regional programs."Throwing billions at defense while ransacking America’s investments in jobs, education, clean energy and lifesaving medical research will leave our nation weakened," said House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi.DEFENSE MONEY FOR CURRENT YEAR Trump also asked for $25 billion more for core Defense Department programs for the current fiscal year, as well as $5 billion more for combat operations. A detailed copy of that request seen by Reuters showed some of the funds would be for procurement of technology such as F-35 fighter aircraft and drone systems.About $13.5 billion of the supplemental request was earmarked for aircraft, missiles and ships. It included THAAD missiles, Blackhawk helicopters and F-35s made by Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N), as well as F/A-18 warplanes and Apache helicopters manufactured by Boeing Co (BA.N).Also for this fiscal year, Trump requested $3 billion more for the Department of Homeland Security, with some of that money intended for planning and construction of the border wall that he made a major part of his 2016 election campaign.Congress will likely consider the supplemental request by April 28, when regular funding expires for most federal agencies. The budget outline also does not incorporate Trump's plan for sparking $1 trillion in investments to build roads, bridges, airports and other infrastructure projects. The White House has said the infrastructure plan is still to come.The planned defense increases are mainly matched by cuts to other programs so as to not increase the $488 billion federal deficit.Despite the proposed big cuts to the EPA and the State Department, Mulvaney said their "core functions" would be preserved. Reflecting Trump's repeated election campaign pledge to reduce illegal immigration, the Department of Homeland Security would get a 6.8 percent increase, with more money for extra staff needed to catch, detain and deport illegal immigrants.Trump wants Congress to approve $1.5 billion for the border wall in the current fiscal year - enough for pilot projects to determine the best way to build it - and a further $2.6 billion in fiscal 2018, Mulvaney said.The estimate for the total cost of the wall will be included in the upcoming full budget.Trump has repeatedly said that Mexico will pay for the wall. Mexico has adamantly said it will not. Since Trump took office in January, the White House has said funding would be kick-started in the United States.

Nathan Rousseau Smith (@fantasticmrnate) explains. 0 shares Share on FacebookShare on TwitterPost on  RedditShare by Email   Transcript: Report: Corey Lewandowski is Bragging He Has Access to Trump's Twitter President Donald Trump’s former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski may be on the outs, but according to him, he’s still got an in. Buzzfeed News is reporting the political operative has been telling prospective clients for his consulting business that he has access to Trump’s Twitter account. Reportedly, the two prospective clients during his pitch meetings were Facebook and Blackstone. It’s unclear whether Lewandowski meant he physically holds the password to Trump’s Twitter account of that he has the ear of the president. In either case, he’s denied having met with those companies and having access to Trump’s Twitter account. Facebook and the Blackstone Group have also denied the meetings took place. If the claim were true, it feeds a narrative which has made publicly held companies nervous, as Trump’s twitter habits have had measurable effects on Boeing, Lockheed Martin, and General Motors. Lewandowski was ousted from Trump’s campaign after he was accused by a Breitbart reporter of physically grabbing her. Trump’s son Donald Jr, has said the split was amicable.

We're on our own' — Glenn Thrush (@GlennThrush) March 16, 2017 * This statement pretty much sums up the Trump administration’s position on climate change: Mulvaney: "We are not spending money on climate change anymore. We view it as a waste of your money." — Dan Primack (@danprimack) March 16, 2017 * Here’s something in Trump’s budget that hasn’t gotten the attention it deserves: President Donald Trump is calling for privatizing the nation’s air traffic control operations in his budget proposal, a top priority of the airline industry. The proposal says spinning off air traffic operations from the Federal Aviation Administration and placing them under an “independent, non-governmental organization” would make the system “more efficient and innovative while maintaining safety.” * Trump tries to pretend that his executive orders on lobbying are how he’s keeping his promise to drain the swamp. But who needs lobbyists when the entire administration is made up of swamp dwellers. Trump’s latest Goldman [Sachs] hire is Jim Donovan, a two-decade veteran of the Wall Street bank, who was nominated to the No. 2 position at the Treasury Department on Tuesday… This week, Trump also reassigned former Goldman Sachs partner Dina Powell to the more prominent role of deputy national security adviser for strategy… Donovan will join a handful of other Goldman alumnus in the Trump administration. Gary Cohn…Jay Clayton…Steve Bannon… * In other swamp news: President Trump on Thursday nominated a top Boeing executive to be the second-highest-ranking civilian at the Pentagon. Trump announced Patrick Shanahan’s nomination to be deputy Defense secretary… * At this point I’m not sure that it matters what Mike Huckabee thinks. But this tweet is the perfect example of the kind of advice you get from the confederate insurgency. Hoping @POTUS tells Hawaii judge what Andrew Jackson told overreaching court-"I'll ignore it and let the court enforce their order." — Gov. Mike Huckabee (@GovMikeHuckabee) March 15, 2017 * After diving into all that ugliness, I need to go to a different place. I don’t know where these ladies are headed, but I’m going to let them take me there. Nancy LeTourneau Nancy LeTourneau is a contributing writer for the Washington Monthly.

In its 45 years of flying, Southwest Airlines Co. has been known for its lean operations and vaunted "20-minute turns" -- the time between a jet getting to a terminal and pulling away for the next flight. The airline's low-cost, no-frills, single-model fleet and mostly direct service meant Southwest didn't need the tablet-toting mechanics, bag scanners for ramp workers and other technological advances that swept the industry. That's about to change as the airline says goodbye to its antiquated systems. Southwest is spending as much as $300 million to bring new technology to the airport ramp and other operations. That adds to the $500 million the airline has devoted to a new reservation system -- the airline's biggest tech update ever. Southwest expects to recoup its investments by 2020. Report card: Which airlines are top flight in punctuality, reliability? "We're looking for minutes," Chief Operating Officer Mike Van de Ven said in an interview. "How do I save a minute here, a minute there? In 2017, we are more deliberate in our continuous improvement efforts." Those efforts have become more critical over the past five years as Southwest has acquired another airline, begun flying larger planes, started overseas flights, built international terminals and expanded service at its home airfield in Dallas. The changes have added complexity, doubling the carrier's turns to a costly 40 minutes. And this year, Southwest will add $700 million in expenses from two new labor contracts and a third under negotiation, according to a JPMorgan Chase & Co. estimate. "Southwest's approach was so successful for so long that it has taken them time to recognize where there's room for improvement," said Samuel Engel, aviation vice president at consulting firm ICF International. "Sometimes you look back and realize, 'There have been innovations and we need to catch up.'" Southwest has been the second-best stock in the Dow Jones Transportation Average, and the best airline, with a 44 percent gain for the six months through Tuesday. Reservation system The new domestic reservation system will replace 30-year-old technology this year, giving Southwest the same ability as rivals to accept foreign currency, recover faster from storms, and more easily change prices and schedules. Southwest also will be able to tighten the timing of flights for connecting passengers, which have increased 11 percent since 2012. Cost of Southwest's tech outage climbs to at least $54 million On the tarmac, mechanics and other workers will get tablets that receive real-time information so they can start addressing problems in the first five minutes of an aircraft's turn. Other tools will let Southwest better match airport staffing to flight-schedule changes. No longer will ramp personnel have to use pneumatic tubes -- a technology that preceded the Wright Brothers' first flight by about 50 years -- to send notes in canisters about luggage and other cargo to workers who calculate critical jet weight and balance and carry the data back to the plane. Instead, the information will be sent electronically. Digital transmissions also will replace printouts for personnel who transport bags to and from planes. The upgrades will start rolling out this year, with more improvements through 2020, when they are expected to boost earnings about $100 million a year. 'Added complexities' "We're pretty manual on the ramp," Van de Ven said. "We have great capabilities, but added complexities. We have to be able to manage through them better." Southwest Airlines bringing faster in-flight Wi-Fi to planes in 2017 New technology had received a lower priority than initiatives like acquiring low-cost rival AirTran Airways in 2010, which put Southwest in Atlanta. The airline then turned to revamping its international and domestic reservation system before upgrading operations. "It does add up over time," said Savanthi Syth, a Raymond James Financial Inc. analyst. "It gives them scalability for future service. Southwest is definitely, more and more every day, looking more like a network carrier." The upgrades will give Southwest additional information to identify bottlenecks in getting passengers on and off planes. The airline already has added an exit stairway from the rear door to the tarmac on some jets. The procedure, in place at 13 airports, isn't used at particularly congested cities or when the weather is bad. Paper tickets And in May, the new reservation system will allow Southwest to get rid of its last paper tickets by issuing electronic versions to people traveling on employee guest passes. While the travel currently is booked online, the passengers need paper tickets, an irritating expense for transactions that don't generate revenue. The carrier issued about 300,000 of the passes last year. In some ways, Southwest has been a victim of its own success. Its longer aircraft turnarounds in part came as the carrier added the Boeing Co. 737-800, the airline's largest plane, to its 737-only fleet. The carrier also has begun traveling farther, flying fewer empty seats and, unlike many rivals, not charging for as many as two checked bags. Such factors mean more luggage on planes, increasing loading and unloading times. "To be real blunt, up until about 2010 it all worked pretty well," Van de Ven said, describing Southwest's old-school ramp operations. "We had a fantastic run in terms of low costs, given the technical infrastructure we had, and we're at that point that we need to make some investments." -By Mary Schlangenstein, Bloomberg View Comments Tags Southwest Airlines Airlines Business Share Facebook Twitter Email Print This Story Get the Most Important D-FW News in Your Inbox Sign up for our daily email newsletters Get Headlines, Business, SportsDay, and GuideLive.

Although Trump's fellow Republicans control both the Senate and House of Representatives, Congress holds the federal purse strings and seldom approves presidents' budget plans.Republicans applauded Trump's call for a 10 percent increase in military spending next year in a budget that would also finance construction of a wall on the border with Mexico and provide more resources for deporting illegal immigrants.But even some conservative Republicans who traditionally fight for smaller government labeled as misguided the Trump administration's request for a 28 percent, or $10.9 billion, cut in State Department funding and other international programs.Protecting national interests requires a comprehensive approach, "including not just military engagement but also the full and responsible use of all diplomatic tools at our disposal," said Republican Representative Hal Rogers, who chairs a panel that oversees State Department and foreign aid spending.Representative Ted Yoho, a member of the right-wing House Freedom Caucus, said international programs were cost-effective, adding they "help advance U.S. national security interests at home and abroad and spur economic job growth.” Trump's plan would eliminate the Overseas Private Investment Corporation that helps spur private investment in foreign development projects. Yoho called it “an amazing corporation” that he said helps generate billions of dollars in U.S. exports.The budget also drew criticism internationally. The French ambassador to the United Nations, Francois Delattre, warned that cutting funding of global programs could fuel instability.Democrats, whose votes would be needed later this year to sign off on the spending bills that implement any budget blueprint given the slim Republican hold on the Senate, attacked the proposed reductions to the Environmental Protection Agency and to programs that benefit the poor.The White House proposal would inflict a 31 percent, or $2.6 billion, cut on the EPA.Some veteran Republicans, including Senator Rob Portman, a former White House budget chief during the administration of President George W. Bush, vowed to preserve the EPA's Great Lakes restoration program that Trump wants to eliminate.House Speaker Paul Ryan sidestepped reporters' questions about whether he supports State Department cuts, saying the White House blueprint was just the start of the budget process. In a message with his budget, Trump said he aimed to advance "the safety and security of the American people," adding he would do so with $54 billion in added military spending next year and putting more money into deporting illegal immigrants.Moderate Republicans expressed unease with potential cuts to popular domestic programs.Lisa Murkowski, who chairs the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, attacked plans to cut or eliminate programs that help the poor pay heating bills, provide aid for localities to deal with wastewater and subsidize air travel in rural areas like her home state of Alaska."We need to remember that these programs are not the primary drivers of our debt," Murkowski said.Other proposed reductions and cuts included community development grants at the Housing Department and more than 20 Education Department programs. Funding would disappear for 19 independent bodies that count on federal money for public broadcasting, the arts and regional programs."Throwing billions at defense while ransacking America’s investments in jobs, education, clean energy and lifesaving medical research will leave our nation weakened," said House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi. The budget outline covered just "discretionary" spending, or programs that must be renewed annually by Congress, for the 2018 fiscal year starting on Oct. 1.It did not address mandatory "entitlement" programs, such as Social Security retirement benefits and federally-backed healthcare for the elderly, poor and disabled, that make up most of the federal budget. Conservatives have been clamoring for year for reforms to these programs to save money. DEFENSE MONEY FOR CURRENT YEAR Trump also asked for $25 billion more for core Defense Department programs for the current fiscal year, as well as $5 billion more for combat operations. A detailed copy of this request seen by Reuters showed some of the funds would be for procurement of technology such as F-35 fighter aircraft and drone systems.About $13.5 billion of the supplemental request was earmarked for aircraft, missiles and ships. It included THAAD missiles, Blackhawk helicopters and F-35s made by Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N), as well as F/A-18 warplanes and Apache helicopters manufactured by Boeing Co (BA.N).Also for this fiscal year, Trump requested $3 billion more for the Department of Homeland Security, with some of that money intended for planning and construction of the border wall that he made a major part of his 2016 election campaign. Congress will likely consider the supplemental request by April 28, when regular funding expires for most federal agencies.On the 2018 budget, Trump is willing to discuss priorities with Congress, said White House budget director Mick Mulvaney, a former South Carolina congressman who made a name for himself as a spending hawk before he was picked to join Trump's Cabinet. The budget outline does not incorporate Trump's plan for sparking $1 trillion in investments to build roads, bridges, airports and other infrastructure projects. The White House has said the infrastructure plan is still to come.The planned defense increases are matched by cuts to other programs so as to not increase the $488 billion federal deficit.Despite the proposed big cuts to the EPA and the State Department, Mulvaney said their "core functions" would be preserved. Reflecting Trump's repeated election campaign pledge to reduce illegal immigration, the Department of Homeland Security would get a 6.8 percent increase, with more money for extra staff needed to catch, detain and deport illegal immigrants.Trump wants Congress to approve $1.5 billion for the border wall in the current fiscal year - enough for pilot projects to determine the best way to build it - and a further $2.6 billion in fiscal 2018, Mulvaney said.The estimate for the total cost of the wall will be included in the full budget. That more detailed document is expected in mid-May and will project spending and revenues over 10 years.Trump has repeatedly said that Mexico will pay for the wall, and Mexico has adamantly said it will not. Since Trump took office in January, the White House has said funding would be kick-started in the United States.The full budget plan will also include economic forecasts and the president's views on "mandatory entitlements" like Social Security and Medicare, which Trump vowed to protect while he was on the campaign trail.

The cumulative market for global expenditure on Military Satellite systems is valued at US$93.3 billion over the forecast period. Global expenditure on Military Satellite systems is expected to show robust growth over the forecast period, primarily due to the increased importance of Military Satellite systems in modern or fourth-generation warfare. The market for ISR Satellites is anticipated to be bigger than other categories because of the increase in demand for data transfer bandwidth, due to the widespread use of UAVs and the need for expeditionary forces to stay connected to the command center. A significant portion of military expenditure is also expected to be directed towards commercial satellite service providers that enable communications and ISR capabilities. However, the high costs associated with military satellite programs are still impeding the smaller nations to spend on acquiring space based capabilities. The global Military Satellite Systems market is expected to be led by North America with a share of 39.2% over the forecast period, followed by Europe with 29.3% and Asia-Pacific with a share of 21.1%. The Middle Eastern market is expected to account for 5.5%, followed by Latin America with 3.3%, and the African markets with a share of 1.6%. Over the forecast period, governments are expected to invest in cheaper alternatives such as microsatellites. This class of satellites is much cheaper and faster to design, build, and launch, although the reliability and longevity of these systems has not been proved yet. One of the reasons for their rapid development timelines is the use of commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) technology, which makes the assembly of these satellites simple and fast.

News Business Business News Toyota invests £240m in Derbyshire car plant but issues Brexit tariff warning 'Continued tariff-and-barrier free market access between the UK and Europe vital for future success' says car manufacturer's president Ben Chapman Thursday 16 March 2017 16:25 GMT Click to follow The Independent Online Toyota has pledged to upgrade the site in Burnaston, which employs around 2,500 people Reuters Toyota will invest a further £240m in its Derbyshire car plant, the company announced on Thursday.  Starting this year, Toyota has pledged to upgrade the site in Burnaston - which employs around 2,500 people - with new equipment, technologies and systems. The news will come as a welcome boost for an industry facing a difficult future if the UK leaves the EU without a favourable trade deal.  Read more Government refuses to publish Nissan letter after deliberations “Continued tariff-and-barrier free market access between the UK and Europe that is predictable and uncomplicated will be vital for future success,“ Dr Johan van Zyl, president and chief executive of Toyota said in a statement. Investment in the industry fell to £1.66bn last year from £2.5bn in 2015 amid uncertainty over Brexit, figures from Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders show. More than half of the cars produced in the UK last year were exported to the EU, while many of the component parts are imported from the trading bloc, meaning any barriers could be costly. Read more Toyota Lifts Earnings Outlook on Weaker Yen, Higher Sales Forecasts Toyota is examining 'how to survive' in a post-Brexit Britain Nissan may 'adjust' its business in the UK despite earlier assurances Brexit: Government didn't offer Nissan money to stay in UK World Trade Organisation tariffs on vehicles are 9.8 per cent while on average the EU imposes a 6 per cent tariff on car imports through its various trade deals. British exports may also have to overcome a host of non-tariff barriers such as “rules of origin” requirements, which state that a minimum percentage of parts must be sourced from within the country of production. Dr Van Zyl said: “We are very focused on securing the global competitiveness of our European plants. We welcome the UK Government funding contribution for this activity. “Our investment demonstrates that, as a company, we are doing all we can to raise the competitiveness of our Burnaston plant in Derbyshire." Business picture of the day 38 show all Business picture of the day 1/38 'UK Disneyland' set to open in five years in Kent - Friday March 10 It’s the news British film-lovers and thrill-seekers have been waiting to hear forever - no longer do we have to schlep across the seas to get our fix of stardust and adrenaline, for the UK is finally getting its own ‘Disneyland’. The theme park will be the first of its kind in the UK, and is being created by film company Paramount at a cost of £3.5 billion. Paramount 2/38 John Lewis cuts staff bonuses to lowest in 63 years despite soaring profits - Thursday March 9 John Lewis has cut its employee bonus to the lowest level in more than 60 years despite announcing surging profits. The partnership, which is owned by its employees, reduced the bonus to 6 per cent of salaries making it the lowest since 1954. It is the fourth year in a row that the payment has been cut. Pre-tax profits rose 21.2 per cent to £370.4m as overall sales rose 3.2 per cent but the group said it cut staff bonuses because of an “increasingly uncertain” market. Reuters 3/38 Philip Hammond downgrades UK economic growth for Brexit years - Wednesday March 8 The Chancellor was forced to slash his official economic growth forecasts while the Brexit talks take place, as he delivered his first Budget. Philip Hammond told MPs that Britain’s economy would grow faster than previously expected in the next financial year – by 2 per cent, up from 1.4 per cent. PA 4/38 UK businesses are already facing recruitment crisis as Polish workers head home - Friday February 15 After a Brexit vote in which a primary concern was too much immigration, some might be applauding the trend, but for important UK industries it is already creating a serious problem, and one that provides a preview of what may be to come for the wider economy. Reuters 5/38 Global sales of UK food and drink hit the £20bn mark for the first time - Tuesday February 21 Global sales of UK food and drink have hit the £20bn mark for the first time in history, as the Government prepares to ramp up its focus on international trade following the UK’s decision to leave the EU. Getty 6/38 Plastics industry 'pressured UK Government to cut recycling targets' - Friday February 17 Recycling targets in the UK were cut last year after successful lobbying from the plastics industry, a freedom of information request by Greenpeace has revealed. The Government came under fire last year after it announced that targets for plastic recycling would be reduced from 57 per cent to a mere 49 per cent for 2016 and then increased by 2 per cent each year to 2020, to a maximum of 57 per cent by 2020. AFP/Getty 7/38 Inflation hits 1.8% as post-Brexit pound weakness feeds through to high street - Tuesday February 14 UK consumer price inflation jumped to 1.8 per cent in the year to January, from a rise of 1.6 per cent in the year to December, as the slump in the pound since the Brexit referendum continued to trickle through to the high street. According to data from the Office for National Statistics published on Tuesday, January’s rise was the biggest since June 2014. But the jump narrowly missed analyst expectations for a 1.9 per cent increase, just below the Bank of England’s official 2 per cent target. Getty Images 8/38 Lettuce crisis hits those who love it most: hungry British sea turtles - Friday February 10 The UK’s vegetable crisis has not only gripped the country’s supermarkets and healthy eaters, but also a bale of 12 hungry green sea turtles in aquariums across the country. Eight aquariums run by the company Sea Life are calling on visitors to spare lettuce or broccoli for their shelled inhabitants who, as a result of a shortage of some vegetables in the UK, are missing out on their favourite meals. GREG WOOD/AFP/Getty Images 9/38 Tim Cook met Theresa May and said the UK would be 'just fine' post Brexit - Thursday February 9 The chief executive of Apple has told Prime Minister Theresa May that he is “very optimistic” about the UK’s future outside of the European Union. Tim Cook met Ms May at Downing Street on Thursday morning and reiterated the tech giant's plans to build a new UK headquarters at the Battersea Power Station as proof of the company's support of the UK. Getty 10/38 Brexit: Bank of England upgrades growth forecasts but still expects UK economy to be hit - Thursday Ferbruary 2 The Bank of England has dramatically upgraded its growth forecast for this year but stressed that households will still experience a major squeeze on incomes due to rising inflation. In its latest Inflation Report, the Bank upgraded its 2017 GDP growth forecast to 2 per cent, up from 1.4 per cent in November.

(COL) As defense spending rises, look to COL as an opportunity play By , Street Authority  |  Mar 16, 2017, 10:30 am EDT Get AAPL alerts: Submit     View All   Popular Posts: Why Starbucks Corporation Stock (SBUX) Could Soon Hit Record Levels Why Microsoft Corporations’s Dividend Payments Could Double Within 5 Years (MSFT) The Best ‘Trump Trade’ Right Now is Rockwell Collins, Inc. (COL) Recent Posts: Why Microsoft Corporations’s Dividend Payments Could Double Within 5 Years (MSFT) The Best ‘Trump Trade’ Right Now is Rockwell Collins, Inc. (COL) Two Harbors Investment Corp REIT (TWO) Pays Out This Sustainable Yield View All Posts Rockwell Collins, Inc. (COL) might not be as popular as Boeing Co (BA) or Lockheed Martin Corporation (LMT), but the company’s roots can be traced back to WWII and the venerable P-51 Mustang. In the ’60s, it produced the Apollo spacecraft that put Neil Armstrong on the moon. By the late ’70s, it was commissioned to spearhead NASA’s Space Shuttle program, starting with “Challenger,” and eventually building four other orbiters that made hundreds of trips into outer space. The GPS systems used by so many of our electronic, automotive and aviation products might not even exist without Rockwell-Collins. Its “Navstar” GPS satellites were among the first commissioned by the Pentagon. By many measures, it has produced some of the most impressive and influential aerospace and communications technology of the 20th century. And even after several mergers and acquisitions, and an eventual spinoff in 2001, Rockwell-Collins is still an aviation, defense and technological force to be reckoned with. But this is more than just a company with an impressive lineage. It is the “best-in-breed” for its sector, heavily integrated into aerospace, defense, infrastructure and even rail. Growth in these sectors equals earnings growth for COL. Given President Trump’s effect on consumer and defense stocks, and his expected $54 billion increase in defense spending alone, I’d expect Rockwell-Collins to be highly valued like many of its peers and trading at new all-time highs, but shares still have a little way to go before hitting either benchmark. And even though Rockwell’s shares have rallied since Trump’s election, there’s still a disconnect between its valuation and that of its peers. 7 Stocks That Will Hit All-Time Highs in 2017 This disconnect is likely because Rockwell sells direct to companies like Boeing and Lockheed, instead of directly to the government. So when investors are researching top defense contractors, Rockwell’s name isn’t the most readily apparent. As more the popular trades get crowded, the information will trickle down To get an idea of value, Rockwell’s forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 17.24 is 43% lower than its industry average (Bloomberg). Its ratio is also lower than both Boeing’s and Lockheed Martin’s, even though its income streams are quite diverse. Oddly, the opposite tends to be the case when you look at other similar supplier-versus-end seller examples such as Apple Inc. (AAPL)  and its supply chain companies.

News Business Business News Billionaire is betting on both sides of French presidential election Ms Le Pen is roughly tied in polls with independent Emmanuel Macron for the first round lead Katia Porzecanski Thursday 16 March 2017 14:09 GMT Click to follow The Independent Online “People are so nervous about this French election affecting markets,” Mr Tepper, who oversees about $1bn, said in a 8 March interview with CNBC AP David Tepper is betting he can make money on the upcoming French election, no matter the outcome. The billionaire hedge fund manager said last week that he’s snapping up European equities because they’re cheap as the market overplays the risk that nationalist Marine Le Pen will win. When it comes to French bonds, he’s taking the opposite position, believing investors are underestimating the chance of a Le Pen victory, according to people familiar with the matter. Mr Tepper, founder of Appaloosa Management, as well as Knighthead Capital Management and Caspian Capital Management, is wagering France’s borrowing costs will rise relative to those of Germany during the run-up to the French election, which begins in April, according to other people with knowledge of the matter. Read more 40,000 sign petition for Obama to be next President of France The trade, which Mr Tepper and his peers put on last year, has started to pay off as polls show growing support for Ms Le Pen, who advocates that France leave the euro. The extra yield investors demand to own France’s 10-year debt over German bunds has doubled since the end of October to 63 basis points, or 0.63 percentage point. Mr Tepper thinks French bonds should yield as much as 1.2 per cent compared with 1.04 per cent on Wednesday, the people said. Representatives for the firms declined to comment. “People are so nervous about this French election affecting markets,” Mr Tepper, who oversees about $1bn , said in a 8 March interview with CNBC. Read more Marine Le Pen set to win first round of French election In bellwether city of Chartres, French election too close to call Fillon could be eliminated in French election as Le Pen extends lead “If I knew the French election was going to go the right way, 100 per cent, I’d be much longer Europe, but there’s a downside there,” he said of his bet on European equities. Ms Le Pen is roughly tied in polls with independent Emmanuel Macron for the first round lead. Ifop’s latest daily rolling poll gives Ms Le Pen 26.5 per cent support and Macron 25.5 per cent. Mr Macron leads Ms Le Pen by 23 points in the runoff in May. ECB Tightening The trio of firms as well as other marquee money managers are also poised to benefit from a change in the European Central Bank’s dovish stance as euro-area economic data improves. Last week, Bloomberg reported that ECB policy makers, in an exchange of views on communicating policy normalisation, also considered whether interest rates could rise before finishing their €2.28 trillion ($2.4 trillion) bond-buying programme. “We think the ECB may be forced to reconsider its stance,” billionaire hedge fund manager Paul Tudor Jones wrote in a 2 February letter to clients obtained by Bloomberg. In it he said he’s bearish global fixed income. Jones sees the possibility of higher yields in longer-duration German instruments, robust Euro Stoxx earnings and a stronger euro versus yen. Mr Tudor wrote that his biggest concern is Italy, “where we worry about the return of political instability, the weak banking sector and the challenge to fiscal sustainability at higher yields.” Hugh Hendry, the hedge fund manager known for his bearish bank bets during the financial crisis, also sees the unwinding of the ECB’s bond-buying programme playing out with a jolt to Italian yields. His firm, Eclectica Asset Management, has built a “substantial position” on Italy’s 10-year bond yields widening over Germany’s.  Business picture of the day 38 show all Business picture of the day 1/38 'UK Disneyland' set to open in five years in Kent - Friday March 10 It’s the news British film-lovers and thrill-seekers have been waiting to hear forever - no longer do we have to schlep across the seas to get our fix of stardust and adrenaline, for the UK is finally getting its own ‘Disneyland’.

Pre-tax profits rose 21.2 per cent to £370.4m as overall sales rose 3.2 per cent but the group said it cut staff bonuses because of an “increasingly uncertain” market.

According to data from the Office for National Statistics published on Tuesday, January’s rise was the biggest since June 2014. But the jump narrowly missed analyst expectations for a 1.9 per cent increase, just below the Bank of England’s official 2 per cent target.

The revision is certain to be seized upon by Brexiteers as evidence that the economy will not suffer from leaving the European Union and that previous economic warnings from the Bank have now been exposed as scaremongering. Yet the Bank’s forecasts continue to project a growth slowdown in 2018 and 2019, with GDP expected to expand by 1.6 per cent and 1.7 per cent in those years.

Sam Machkovech - Mar 16, 2017 1:30 pm UTC reader comments 227 Share this story Ars at SXSW 2017 The design philosophies behind some of our favorite movie aliens The Kim Dotcom film: How to avoid a trial for 5 years and counting The CIA uses board games to train officers—and I got to play them Stranger Things wanted its music to be “something people talked about” Former VP laments that even now, sharing medical data is awful View more stories AUSTIN, Texas—"Did you like the movie?" Twelve seconds after I've introduced myself to Bill Nye, under the auspices of interviewing him, I find myself receiving the questions. He's TV's "The Science Guy," after all, and he has reason to ask that opening question: his entire life was just put under a documentarian's microscope. He had not seen Bill Nye: Science Guy until the night before (nor had pretty much anyone else, since it was the film's world premiere). Already, it's time for peer review. I offer my own succinct statement—"I really liked it"—and Nye fills the following brief pause with all of the thoughts he's come up with in the past 12 hours. He appreciates how the film talked about the congenital condition on his father's side of the family; wishes the film offered more context for a story about his early career; is happy about new footage of one of his science-debate opponents mulling a change of heart. "That's surprising and cool!" My chat with Nye felt far too brief, and the same went for his documentary. Both had something riveting in common: a tremendously human and vulnerable mission to advocate for science. Reflecting on his father's impact Just two of TV's biggest super-nerds, and one of 'em has a wine glass with a moon and stars on it. No big. Erika Kapin "There's billions and bill—wait, has someone used that line already?" To be clear: the film isn't the same as Bill Nye Saves the World, the Netflix TV series debuting on April 21. Science Guy purports to tell Nye's life story, and its first mission is to make clear just why the guy is even worth his own documentary. A throng of screaming young people shows up to tick this box within the first few minutes, all praising the TV show host and science educator. Some of them come on camera to blame his public-television series for their adult pursuit of scientific studies. Others, like a gang of four 18-year-olds in military fatigues, laugh when they admit they were just happy when the words "Bill! Bill! Bill! Bill!" played on a VCR during a school day. The documentary lingers on these positive moments—his opening greeting to a roaring college assembly, his wine-glass clinks with Neil DeGrasse Tyson, his meetings with modern YouTube science-show hosts—but only for so long. Filmmakers David Alvarado and Jason Sussberg pick and focus on a few narrative threads here, and they do an admirably good job weaving them together. Further ReadingBill Nye returns to TV in 2017 with Netflix talk showNye proves generous in terms of personal access. Archival footage of his TV show's production process and old family movies of him and his parents anchor some very telling interviews about Nye's upbringing, and these tap a few surprisingly emotional veins. His original series' crew complains pretty tersely about a momentary betrayal when Nye chased another TV deal in 1991 (it ultimately fell through). His mother was a code-cracking genius during World War II, which inspired him in good ways, while he openly admits that he adopted the worst aspects of his father's darker side. He admits some of his weaknesses while talking to a researcher who is more interested in the ataxia (a syndrome involving lack of muscle control) that runs on his father's side of the family. Shortly afterward, while in the backseat of a car, Nye looks out the window and openly regrets dodging the condition, which his two siblings suffer from. He doesn't deserve to have dodged that genetic bullet, he says, and he admits that his worries of passing ataxia on to children is why he doesn't have any of his own. Later in the film, he says that his work as an advocate for science is in no small part a compensatory exercise. Battling two forces of ignorance All the while, Nye faces off against two particular forces of ignorance. Science Guy's cameras follow Nye as he visits the Creationist Museum and verbally spars with its creator, scientifically illiterate Ken Ham. We also see Nye follow this up with a visit to Ham's follow-up project, a theme park dedicated to Noah's Ark. The footage within both facilities is chilling, including one installation that attempts to refute the legitimacy of the Lucy fossils and a seemingly endless series of dioramas in which man and dinosaur frolic together in forests. If that's not bad enough, the duo's conversation at the crowded Noah's Ark park is nothing short of frigid. Upon hearing one comment by Ham about the man's staff of "scientists," Nye swallows and pauses. "Your scientists, I want to be as respectful as possible, are incompetent." Later, Ham tries to scare a little girl by saying that Nye wants to liken humans to "just animals." Nye loudly objects to the word "just," declaring that humans are remarkable animals. "I like what he said better," the girl says as she points at Ham. We only have so long to get through to kids, Nye says, gesturing to the Ham buildings' bonkers installations. Nye also grapples with accusations that joining Ham for public debates on scientific issues may have helped Ham raise money. Further ReadingClimate Hustle wants you to believe you just can’t trust climate scienceTalking heads appear throughout the film to represent a far more grave threat to science in Nye's eyes: those who would deny humanity's contributions to climate change. Fox News Channel figures largely in these parts, but while famous Fox faces like Sarah Palin pop up briefly to insult Nye's lack of a PhD, Science Guy puts a larger spotlight on Joe Bastardi, a bodybuilding meteorologist (yes, really) who frequently appears on Fox News to downplay humans' impact on climate change. (Conveniently, he also speaks at seminars hosted by oil and coal companies. When confronted about this, Bastardi tells the filmmakers that he couldn't be trying to profit from climate change scaremongering because of how average his cars are.) Bastardi also tries to challenge Nye to a public debate, but Nye revises his strategy after criticism over how his Ham debate turned out. The duo meets at Bastardi's house for dinner and wine, and the meteorologist's college-aged son shows up, absolutely giddy to meet his admitted childhood hero. The men argue over drinks, with Bastardi nastily shutting his son up at one point during an exchange about climate studies. The next day, at the scheduled debate at a college lecture (no live-streaming or network TV cameras this time, just the documentary crew), Bastardi doesn't show up—but his son does. Liquid nitrogen coming out of marshmallows What happens next in the film, with both Bastardi and his son, is a little too weird to spoil here, and Nye tells me he's still surprised by both halves of how that ended. (The filmmakers kept one part of the story secret until the movie premiered. "That was wacky," he said to Ars.) Climate change? The heck you talking about, Bill Nye? Looks cold to me! "These trapped gases aren't just going to measure themselves, folks." Science Guy rounds out all of this content with a whopping dollop of hard science, particularly when he travels to Greenland to document the work being done to accurately measure carbon levels in the atmosphere. This footage of Nye helping researchers take ice-core measurements is pretty striking, though not as much as Nye's tour of an ice sheet falling apart as a giant river flows past it. That river's not supposed to be so big, we're told. The film's biggest success may be how it finds the right balance of personal and scientific information, because you can't tell one side of Nye's life without the other. Still, Nye and I talk about a few things the film glossed over, particularly his young life in Seattle as both a Boeing engineer and an assistant at the city's esteemed Pacific Science Center. (We didn't have time to talk about his limited appearances on the Seattle sketch comedy show Almost Live!, however, but I did make a Speed Walker joke.) Nye smiled upon remembering liquid-nitrogen demonstrations he did at the Pacific Science Center: "We’d chew marshmallows together, and steam would come out of my nose, oh!" Nye said. "That was really good. So much fun. I was a young guy. I wanted to do some good or something. I was a United Way big brother, and I volunteered at the Science Center on weekends. I really enjoyed that." Then Nye looked up at me, still considering some comments made in the film about whether his Ham debate had ulterior motives. "You know, performers like to perform. They got Steve Wilson [early director on Bill Nye the Science Guy] saying, 'Bill Nye always wanted to be famous.' What it is, is, you want to be influential. Call it famous, but you want to be influential." Never forget the tent caterpillar catastrophe The film never truly picks a side as to Nye's motives, beyond letting Nye give so much credit to Carl Sagan (whose footsteps he followed in becoming the Planetary Society's CEO). Nye's vulnerability, as shown in this film, really does make his work in scientific advocacy all the more compelling. And I feel even stronger about this after talking to the man—or, honestly, being talked to by the man. Once he gets started on a subject, it's hard to stop him, whether he talks about his work at the Planetary Society on solar sail projects ("it's romantic, sailing on sunlight!"), about upcoming events ("come out for the March for Science on April 22—that's Earth Day!"), or about Fox News' Nye criticisms ("'Bill Nye is ONLY a mechanical engineer.' Can’t read a graph, can’t understand physics. Knows nothing of fluid mechanics or heat transfer. Like, really?"). At one point, he notices the limited time we have to talk and laughs. "I’m so long-winded! It’s a curse. A curse." Further ReadingFox News successfully creates climate confusion, but only among conservativesMore than any message, Nye emphasizes the importance of conversations about science between everyday people. Just talk about climate change with anybody, he insists. I saw Nye advise tons of people to do this: throughout the film; at the post-film Q&A with fans; and even during our own conversation. In my conversation, he actually clarified why he's advising that so much: to battle cognitive dissonance. "When you have a worldview, and you’re confronted with evidence that contradicts it, you gotta do something. You have dissonance, conflict in your mind. You either change your whole worldview, which is quite difficult the older you get, or you dismiss the evidence. Along with that, you dismiss the authority. "We have to chip away at [climate change denial]," he continued. "It takes about two years for somebody who believes in astrology, believes in subluxations in chiropractic, believes in homeopathy, it takes about two years to overcome that. You have to hear it over and over again. You have to sit and mull it over." Further ReadingTrump flips science the bird with new budgetThe rest of his advice to the world at large: accept a truly globalized world ("I have a line of bow ties… that’s made in China… because that’s where they have silkworms!") and go all-in on energy policy that kicks fossil fuels to the curb. "We could power the entire US, and over 130 countries around the world, right now, renewably, if we decided to do it," Nye said. "The guy driving down a ski run, in a Land Rover... I just don’t drive that way very much. I seldom have the opportunity to drive down a mountain in a vehicle. It’s not how I drive. I can easily see a time when nobody knows how to drive."

News Business Business News Peta to buy Canada Goose shares in effort to stop firm using coyote fur Animals used for fur can endure 'long, excruciating deaths in steel traps', director of the charity says Ben Chapman Thursday 16 March 2017 11:45 GMT Click to follow The Independent Online Up-market coat retailer Canada Goose is set to go public on Thursday in a $240m (£195.5m) float, but animal rights activists are determined to spoil the party. People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (Peta) wants to be first in line to snap up enough shares so that it can be admitted to Canada Goose’s shareholder meetings. The group will then pressure Canada Goose to stop using coyote fur on their jackets, which it says is unethical. Read more Peta takes ownership stake in LVMH to fight use of crocodile skins “The fur on Canada Goose jackets comes from coyotes, who can endure a long, excruciating death in steel traps,” Peta associate director Elisa Allen said in a statement this week on the group’s website. “Anyone who buys or sells one of the company’s fur-trimmed jackets is responsible for these animals’ suffering.” Peta staged a protest in Knightsbridge on Tuesday where department stores Harvey Nichols and Harrods sell Canada Goose outerwear. Wearing a replica Canada Goose jacket, a Peta model stood in a “bloody” steel trap to illustrate the plight of the coyotes.  Buying stakes in companies to influence their policies is nothing new for Peta, which has a history of shareholder activism dating back to 1987.  More recently, after buying Seaworld stock when it went public in 2013, Peta brought in actress Jessica Biel to ask the company at its AGM when it would stop holding killer whales in captivity. The company has since changed its policy and is phasing out its killer whale show. Peta has also bought shares in Hermès, Prada and, its most-recent purchase, LVMH, according to statements on its website. It has put the designer brands in the spotlight for their treatment of crocodiles and alligators, which are farmed for their skin to make expensive handbags, belts and shoes. A recent exposé showed the animals are confined to tiny pits and that they are sometimes cut into while still alive.

According to data from the Office for National Statistics published on Tuesday, January’s rise was the biggest since June 2014. But the jump narrowly missed analyst expectations for a 1.9 per cent increase, just below the Bank of England’s official 2 per cent target.

Getty 10/38 Brexit: Bank of England upgrades growth forecasts but still expects UK economy to be hit - Thursday Ferbruary 2 The Bank of England has dramatically upgraded its growth forecast for this year but stressed that households will still experience a major squeeze on incomes due to rising inflation. In its latest Inflation Report, the Bank upgraded its 2017 GDP growth forecast to 2 per cent, up from 1.4 per cent in November. The revision is certain to be seized upon by Brexiteers as evidence that the economy will not suffer from leaving the European Union and that previous economic warnings from the Bank have now been exposed as scaremongering. Yet the Bank’s forecasts continue to project a growth slowdown in 2018 and 2019, with GDP expected to expand by 1.6 per cent and 1.7 per cent in those years.

The grocer is promising only "fair" prices as its blushes were saved by Argos  James Moore Chief Business Commentator @JimMooreJourno Thursday 16 March 2017 10:32 GMT Click to follow The Independent Online Sainsbury's boss Mike Coupe Rosie Hallam/eyevine “Our values make us different,” Sainsbury’s trumpeted at the end of the latest trading statement, above a section devoted to its “Waste less, Save more” initiative and a new bakery college in Bromley-By-Bow.  But do shoppers really care enough about that to pay a bit more? Sainsbury’s seems to think they will. Hence the grocer touting “great products and services at fair prices” with the emphasis on “fair” as opposed to “market leading”.  The evidence, for now, is mixed. Sainsbury’s latest trading statement showed that sales fell by 0.5 per cent during the 11 weeks to March 11.  Read more Sainsbury's warns of Brexit price rises as sales fall Sainsbury's is now selling same-sex Valentine's Day cards Sainsbury's warns chairman for using staff to refurbish own home While that counts as a disappointment, it’s nothing to get bent out of shape over. The company pointed out that Mothers Day and Easter were late this year.  Had they fallen at the same time, it would have been able to report a (very) modest rise.  It didn’t need to make a big fuss about that because of Argos, picked up off the sale rail for £1.4bn last year, which chalked up a handy 3.8 per cent rise. Combined the two turned in a 0.3 per cent sales increase.  No wonder Sainsbury’s plans have 250 Argos outlets in Sainsbury’s stores within three years. They might yet prove to be a rather better draw for the grocer than its “fair prices” if it can get the business singing. That would involve getting to a place where customers are not told that product X found on the web site isn’t available online, but can be accessed after 300 mile drive up to the Bolton branch. Note to CEO Mike Coupe: Amazon doesn’t do that. But these are still early days. The worry about the Argos acquisition was that it would result in Mr Coupe’s team taking their eyes off the ball in the midst of a supermarket price war.  Set against an improving Tesco and the remarkable resurgence of Morrisons, these numbers could be worse. There are no serious signs of that happening and Sainsbury’s is just about holding its own, while proving the sceptics (including me at first) wrong about Argos.  Business picture of the day 38 show all Business picture of the day 1/38 'UK Disneyland' set to open in five years in Kent - Friday March 10 It’s the news British film-lovers and thrill-seekers have been waiting to hear forever - no longer do we have to schlep across the seas to get our fix of stardust and adrenaline, for the UK is finally getting its own ‘Disneyland’.

According to data from the Office for National Statistics published on Tuesday, January’s rise was the biggest since June 2014.

In its latest Inflation Report, the Bank upgraded its 2017 GDP growth forecast to 2 per cent, up from 1.4 per cent in November. The revision is certain to be seized upon by Brexiteers as evidence that the economy will not suffer from leaving the European Union and that previous economic warnings from the Bank have now been exposed as scaremongering. Yet the Bank’s forecasts continue to project a growth slowdown in 2018 and 2019, with GDP expected to expand by 1.6 per cent and 1.7 per cent in those years.

News Business Business News US dollar falls and bonds rise after Federal Reserve raises rates but says future moves would be 'gradual' The dollar index, which measures the currency’s strength against a broad spectrum of other currencies, slumped to a three-week low Josie Cox Business Editor Thursday 16 March 2017 08:00 GMT Click to follow The Independent Online The Fed lifted its funds rate by 25 basis points, as expected, to a range of 0.75 per cent to 1.00 per cent, but said further increases would only be 'gradual' AFP The dollar fell sharply while US government bonds enjoyed their biggest rally in around nine months after the Federal Reserve on Wednesday raised interest rates for only the third time in a decade, but signalled that it would proceed cautiously going forward. The Fed lifted its funds rate by 25 basis points, as expected, to a range of 0.75 per cent to 1.00 per cent, but said further increases would only be "gradual." The central bank’s chief, Janet Yellen, also said that the Fed was sticking to its forecast for two more hikes in 2017 and three more in 2018. A large proportion of economists had expected a pick-up to these projections. Read more US Federal Reserve raises interest rates Immediately after the decision, the dollar index, which measures the currency’s strength against a broad spectrum of other currencies, slumped to a three-week low of 100.510. Higher interest rates generally support a country’s currency. “With the scale, mix and timing of any fiscal stimulus still very unclear, the Fed is right to be cautious with the pace of tightening, despite some robust economic data in recent weeks,” said Ian Kernohan, an economist at Royal London Asset Management. “We expect more rate hikes this year, which should be supportive of the dollar,” he added. Read more The dollar is rising again on the prospect of higher interest rates Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen warns against Brexit Fed chair signals slower pace of US interest rate rises Tom Stevenson, investment director for personal investing at Fidelity International, said that “the Fed is clearly erring on the side of caution”. Two-year US bond yields recorded their biggest daily drop since last June overnight, as bond prices rose. Forecasts for more rate increases would likely have spurred bond yields. A sigh of relief also echoed through emerging markets. There had been fears that a quicker rise in interest rates in the US would have led investors to pull more money out of higher-yielding funds in riskier markets.

According to data from the Office for National Statistics published on Tuesday, January’s rise was the biggest since June 2014.

In its latest Inflation Report, the Bank upgraded its 2017 GDP growth forecast to 2 per cent, up from 1.4 per cent in November. The revision is certain to be seized upon by Brexiteers as evidence that the economy will not suffer from leaving the European Union and that previous economic warnings from the Bank have now been exposed as scaremongering. Yet the Bank’s forecasts continue to project a growth slowdown in 2018 and 2019, with GDP expected to expand by 1.6 per cent and 1.7 per cent in those years.

The Abu Dhabi-based airline will deploy an Airbus Group SE A380 now serving Mumbai for one of two daily flights to Paris during the peak July 1-to-Oct. 28 summer timetable, Etihad said in a statement. The carrier will assign an Airbus A340-600 to the Indian route, a spokeswoman said in an e-mail.

Following the stress associated with the over three-hour trip by road to Kaduna where in-and-out bound Abuja flights have been directed in the wake of the closure, this approval of chopper shuttle would ease the many troubles put in the way of air travellers. The Minister of State for Aviation, Hadi Sirika, who broke the news to reporters yesterday in Abuja, said the permission was given by the National Security Adviser (NSA), Major General Babagana Monguno. He recalled that the same office had earlier banned all flight services pending the completion of the repairs. His words: “The NSA has the constitutional responsibility vested in him to advise the president on national security matters. Within his wisdom, he had earlier issued out letters banning helicopter operation in the airport. “But the National Security Adviser early yesterday approved that helicopters will of course continue to fly to Abuja airport from wherever.” The minister, however, noted that the procedure for landing was being worked out. He went on: “This means that helicopters can come into Abuja and out bearing in mind that within the metropolitan city of Abuja there are no fly zones and this is very normal in every country. “They have areas where there are no fly zones but the National Security Adviser this morning (yesterday) approved that helicopters should enter Abuja airport and out but the procedures in which helicopters should enter into Abuja and the spot which they will land will be advised in due course and it shall be before the end of today (yesterday).” Sirika added that airline operations had been smooth at the Kaduna International Airport since flight diversion began.“We thank God the operations in Kaduna are going on smoothly. We are able to do what we said we would do, we are actually working our talk, we thank Nigerians for understanding with us in this period of emergency.” On the refusal of foreign airlines to land in Kaduna, the minister noted: “At least Ethiopian airlines are coming with brand new equipment, Dream Liner. The newest baby in the world of aviation, Boeing 787, has landed in Kaduna.” Operators yesterday hailed the news. They said the policy reversal would restore investor confidence and increase the revenue base of government. Efforts to get the comments of the chairman of Airlines Operators of Nigeria (AON), Captain Nogie Meggisson, were futile as his phone was switched off. His deputies later confirmed that he was still stuck in a meeting over the same issue. The Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of a helicopter service company said: “It was really tough getting the reverse order and AON had to go to any length to salvage the huge losses.” Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Google+ Share on LinkedIn Share via Email In this article: Hadi SirikaNnamdi Azikiwe International Airport You may also like Unpaid salaries: ASUU threatens to shut down NDU, RSU, others 1 hour ago  Nigeria Makarfi: Dickson betrayed Jonathan, governors 2 hours ago  Nigeria US Ambassador to Umahi: You’re putting government to work 2 hours ago  Nigeria More   Football Wenger to reveal future at Arsenal soon after 1-3 loss to West Brom 3 hours ago   We’re sure of victory over plateau united, Odey assures fans 5 hours ago   Bournemouth on the rise as Swansea slump 1 day ago   Casemiro sends Real Madrid five points clear 1 day ago   Get the latest news and analysis of issues from Nigeria, Africa and around the world, direct into your inbox, daily Subscribe Now Top News Nigeria Africa World Metro Opinion Editorial Columnists Cartoons Business Appointments Business News Business RoundUp Industry Aviation Capital Market Communications Energy DrillBytes Maritime SweetCrude Infrastructure Money Technology Gadgets Telecoms Social Media Technology Sport Football Boxing Athletics Tennis Golf Arts Arts Art House Artfolk Revue Film Literature Music Theatre Visual Arts Features Policy & Politics BusinessAgro Education Executive Motoring Executive Briefs Focus Friday Worship Law Media Science Youth Speak Property Environment Mortgage Finance Real Estate Urban Development Guardian Woman Entrepreneurship GW Fiction Personality Issues WIMBIZ Saturday Magazine Youth Magazine Just Human Life & Style Love & Life Transition Travel & Tourism Celebrity Brand Intelligence Gardening Weekend Beats Sunday Magazine Ibru Ecumenical Centre Campus CityFile News Feature Living Healthy Diet Living Wellbeing Newspeople Aspire By Zenith Guardian TV News Opinion Fashion Sport Entertainment Science & Tech GTV Exclusive Guardian Life Home Lifestyle Showbiz Trending LS Diaries On The Cover The Guardian Home About Us Advertise With Us |     Powered by Ventra Copyright © 2017 Guardian Newspapers.

The SAR flag carrier made a net loss for 2016 of HKD$575 million (USD$74 million), from a HKD$6 billion profit the previous year. Annual revenue was down 9.4 percent to HKD$92.75 billion (USD$11.94 billion) as regional competitors ramped up capacity. Cathay blamed “intense and increasing competition” as the biggest drag on performance, with mainland Chinese carriers launching more direct flights to international destinations. Competition from low cost carriers increased, with overcapacity a particular problem, Cathay said. Passenger revenue saw an 8.4 percent drop to HKD$66.93 billion as the airline introduced new routes and increased frequencies, with capacity up overall by 2.4 percent. Load factor dropped 1.2 percentage points to 84.5 percent. Yield was down 9.2 percent, reflecting the overcapacity. Revenue at Cathay’s cargo business was HKD$20.06 billion, 13.2 percent down from 2015 as strong competition and overcapacity again plagued the airline. Cargo carried rose by 3.1 percent on a 0.6 percent capacity increase. Load factor came in 0.2 percentage points higher at 64.4 percent. Cathay added new routes during the year and said it would add more in 2017. Tel Aviv, Barcelona and Christchurch will be added and some destinations will have increased frequencies. During the year Cathay retired the last of its fuel-hungry Airbus A340s and Boeing 747s, and added Airbus A350s to its fleet. Looking forward, Cathay chairman John Slosar said: “We expect the operating environment in 2017 to remain challenging. Strong competition from other airlines and the adverse effect of the strength of the Hong Kong dollar are expected to continue to put pressure on yield. The cargo market got off to a good start, but overcapacity is expected to persist.” (Airwise) Top Stories IAG To Launch Low-cost Long-haul Airline Alitalia To Cut 2,000 Jobs, EUR€1 Billion Costs Eleven Airlines Fined For Cargo Price Fixing Lufthansa Group Boosts 2016 Net Profit Brazil Auctions Four Airports For USD$1.19 Billion Search Airwise Airwise News Top Stories Airline News Airport News Aviation News Feature Stories Cargo/Freight News Travel Industry News Tourism News Most Viewed Stories Brazil Auctions Four Airports For USD$1.19 Billion IAG To Launch Low-cost Long-haul Airline Lufthansa Group Boosts 2016 Net Profit Eleven Airlines Fined For Cargo Price Fixing Alitalia To Cut 2,000 Jobs, EUR€1 Billion Costs AIRWISE Home Site Search Contact Us AIRWISE NEWS Top Stories Airline News Airport News Aviation News Cargo/Freight News Travel Industry News Tourism News Feature Stories Popular Stories Recently Added Stories AIRPORT GUIDE World Airports US Airports UK Airports European Airports Canadian Airports South American Airports Middle East Airports African Airports Asian Airports South Pacific Airports AIRLINE INFO World Airlines US Airlines UK Airlines European Airlines Canadian Airlines South American Airlines Middle East Airlines African Airlines Asian Airlines South Pacific Airlines Copyright © 2017 Ascent Pacific.

He must build a federal budget that accounts for President Donald Trump’s focus on frugality, deregulation and his extraordinary bargaining ability – a challenge to the traditional budget scoring process.  The traditional process anticipates and accounts for red tape and typical procurement policies. So any proposed budget based on the bureaucratic system will inevitably be far more expensive than a budget driven by President Trump's entrepreneurial drive and frugality. The latest economic outlook from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) estimated the federal budget deficit in the 2016 budget year was $544 billion. This represents a public debt of 76 percent of the gross domestic product. By 2026, this figure is expected to exceed 86 percent – assuming nothing changes in Washington. However, something has changed in Washington – the arrival of President Trump. Director Mulvaney has the great challenge of calculating how much the president’s entrepreneurial skills will significantly lower costs and reverse projected trends over the next decade. If Mulvaney and his team successfully create a Trumpian budget, the administration can potentially save a tremendous amount of money. Look at federal construction alone. President Trump's entire career was based on successful construction with great buildings delivered at or below budget and ahead of schedule. Applying Trumpian principles to the hundreds of billions of dollars’ worth of federal construction planned over the next decade could be a huge opportunity for a less expensive federal budget. President Trump’s skills could help save tens of billions of dollars on a long list of federal projects including buildings, roads, bridges, locks, dams and other major infrastructure projects across the country. Take the Wollman Rink example from President Trump’s book The Art of the Deal. The City of New York had spent six years and $15 million trying to repair the Wollman Rink. Trump, who could see the defunct rink from his home in Trump Tower, finally got fed up and offered to take over the repairs. He was able to fully repair the rink in less than four months for less than $2.5 million. He even had time and money left over to renovate the adjacent restaurant and skate house. Or take a more recent project, Trump International, built in the Old Post Office in Washington, D.C. This project opened in October 2016, but its final contracted completion date with the General Services Administration was actually August 2018. The Wollman Rink was fixed for one-sixth of the cost in one-eighteenth of the time New York City had spent failing. President Trump’s team should apply the Wollman Rink model to every major construction project it undertakes – such as the wall on the Mexican border – and the $1 trillion-worth of infrastructure President Trump wants to build. Further, if Director Mulvaney can work with Congress to identify and change laws that currently push projects over schedule, force bureaucrats to make poor decisions, and drive up costs, the long-term price tag for federal construction can be reduced even further. President Trump can save tens of billions of dollars in the direct federal construction budget and hundreds of billions of dollars on federal contracting and funding over the next decade. President Trump should also continue to determine what current contracts and programs need to be renegotiated. For instance, all construction contracts with costs that exceed $100 million should be reviewed as soon as possible, and renegotiations or cancellations should be ordered wherever possible. He has already begun renegotiating major contracts with Boeing and Lockheed Martin with positive results. President Trump was able to shave $600 million off the disastrous F-35 fighter jet program, and has extracted assurances from Boeing that the price tag for two Air Force One replacements will not exceed $4 billion. With contracts as large as these, even a savings of 6 percent can keep billions of tax dollars in the federal coffers. But renegotiation isn’t enough. President Trump should make sure all federal contracts are rigorously enforced – just as he did with the Wollman Rink and other Trump developments. The administration should also introduce the same type of sound data systems that protect private sector companies from fraud into frequently abused federal programs such as Medicaid, Medicare and Social Security. If the administration applied these same anti-fraud systems to federally funded healthcare, food stamp and disability benefits, and other programs, it could save taxpayers $120 billion to $160 billion a year – well over a trillion dollars a decade. This first Trumpian budget shouldn't just be frugal. It should be relentlessly innovative in applying the principles the President has developed throughout his long and impressive career.

The proposals were part of a $30 billion supplemental request to Congress to add more money to the Pentagon's budget during the government's ongoing fiscal year, which began under the Obama administration and ends in September.It includes plans to crank up U.S. funding for the fight against Islamic State militants for items like high-tech bombs and defences against insurgents' drones, bringing overall spending on the campaign to the highest level yet, the Pentagon said."This will likely be our largest request," Roth said.One analyst called the $2 billion flexible spending request a Pentagon "slush fund," and many lawmakers were expected to be reluctant to loosen oversight over how the Pentagon spends money.What Trump's additional funding might mean for America's evolving war strategy against Islamic State in the coming months was not immediately clear. But the request comes as U.S.-backed forces in Iraq and Syria are entering a critical phase in their campaign to retake Islamic State's two biggest cities of Mosul in Iraq and Raqqa in Syria. Trump's administration is weighing deployment of more U.S. troops.The heads of the top U.S. congressional committees that oversee the Pentagon have criticized Trump's 2018 budget request, saying even more money was needed."It is clear to virtually everyone that we have cut our military too much and that it has suffered enormous damage," said Republican Representative Mac Thornberry, chairman of the House of Representatives Armed Services Committee. Todd Harrison at the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank in Washington questioned whether Trump's budget wish list could muster enough support among Democrats, whose votes would be needed to sign off on the spending bills given the slim Republican hold on the Senate. MORE CASH FOR GUANTANAMO Trump said during the election campaign that he not only wanted to keep the Guantanamo Bay detention centre open but "load it up with some bad dudes."Trump's $5.1 billion "overseas contingency operations" request included a provision for $1.1 billion in additional funds for a range of Pentagon projects, including "planning and design of construction projects in support of Detention Operations at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba."The prison, which was opened by Republican President George W. Bush to hold terrorism suspects captured overseas after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks came to symbolize harsh detention practices that opened the United States to accusations of torture. Obama reduced the inmate population to 41, but fell short of fulfilling his promise to close the jail.The 2017 request would also hike spending for the broader Defense Department over the next six months, with $24.9 billion more sought to "readiness needs" after years of complaints over congressionally imposed spending caps.Lockheed Martin (LMT.N) would be one of the biggest beneficiaries of that proposal. Some $13.5 billion would be spent on more military hardware, including five F-35 warplanes as well as Army Blackhawk helicopters made by Sikorsky Aircraft, a Lockheed subsidiary. Trump also wants 12 interceptors for the THAAD missile defence system. The United States is now deploying THAAD in South Korea in response to North Korea's ballistic missile and nuclear tests.Boeing (BA.N) would also gain with $2.4 billion for an additional 24 of its F/A-18 E/F jet fighters. A further $7.2 billion would pay for things like military training, cyber and intelligence capabilities and support for weapons systems.

Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds. Story highlights Aviation "geek" lists five places worth a visit Chuck Yeager of "Right Stuff" fame parties at Edwards AFB Arizona's Boneyard: Where military planes go to die Seattle has first jet-powered Air Force One, last Concorde (CNN)I'm not an aviation geek. Am I? The other day, somebody asked me which five aviation destinations I'd like to check off my bucket list. Like millions of others, I've already hit some of the must-see stunners: the Smithsonian Air and Space Museum and Pensacola's Naval Aviation Museum, Ohio's National Museum of the USAF and Patriot's Point in Charleston, South Carolina. Here's the thing -- aviation museums and other sites let us mere mortals approach the impossible. We get to see, and sometimes touch, historic artifacts that were designed to move at blazing fast speeds. For most of us, it's the closest we can come to catching a lightning bolt. Some of the most complicated and formerly top secret machines ever imagined have become monuments to motion in communities across America. The places where these machines were born and pushed to their limits have become hallowed ground. How can you not want to check them out? Read More How can you NOT want to sit inside the supersonic airliner that made the last flight of the Concorde? Or see the spy plane dubbed the world's fastest "air-breathing" production aircraft? Or fly over the "boneyard" where military aircraft go to die? Or hang out where the "Right Stuff" flyboys risked death to break the sound barrier? Hmmm ... this all doesn't sound too geeky. Does it? For the record, I'm offering three possible signs you may be an aviation geek: 1. The photo snap. When I'm at the airport waiting to board, I often will snap a photo of my airliner through the gate window. I still don't know exactly why I do that. Maybe it's because every aircraft is unique. They come off the assembly line after years -- sometimes decades -- of painstaking research and development. Then, each one gets a tracking number and is closely followed throughout its career. There are apps and websites dedicated to tracking commercial airliners. Here's one that tracks aircraft flown by Delta Air Lines and dozens of other carriers. 2. ID please. When I board a plane, I look at the ID information engraved inside the aircraft door. Often times, etched into that metal plate, is the aircraft model and its date of birth. Great, now I know how old my plane is. Essential information. Oops, I'm holding up the line to board because I'm staring at the edge of the door. Sorry. That's not really that geeky. Is it? 3. Watch 'n' gawk. Finally, don't tell anybody, but I've been known to visit small airports just to watch planes take off and land. This kind of behavior might be considered unusual, especially by those working in law enforcement. And now for the five must-sees: Aerospace capital One place I've been meaning to get to for a while now is Edwards Air Force Base in California. The region around Edwards is kind of a magnet for aviation geeks. Some folks call it America's aerospace capital. In the high desert about an hour's drive north of Los Angeles, the area is packed full of aviation history. It's a world punctuated by the occasional sonic boom, where some of America's most sophisticated and secret aircraft were developed including the stealthy F-117 Nighthawk, the F-104 Starfighter and the spy planes U-2 Dragon Lady and SR-71 Blackbird. But most of all, the skies over Edwards became a deadly crucible that forged test-pilot greats such as Chuck Yeager. For the few who don't know, Yeager's the first human to fly above Mach 1, the speed of sound. "We'd been working our tail off on the airplane," Yeager told me during a phone interview. "When we did get it above Mach 1, obviously it made us very happy because we'd done something the rest of the world had been trying to do for years." Yeager pulls no punches about space travel But Yeager and his team were ordered to keep the news quiet. Don't celebrate, they were told. It's classified. After the word leaked, "we started to celebrate somewhat," enjoying good times at a local test pilot watering hole. The Happy Bottom Riding Club and its owner, a woman stunt pilot named Pancho Barnes, gained fame in the film "The Right Stuff." Six decades later, the celebrating continues at Happy Bottom -- at least at what's left of it. Destroyed by fire long ago, Yeager showed up at the building's ruins recently for an annual party thrown by locals to honor Pancho and the Cold War test pilots. "They fix it all up and get some platforms and have a barbecue and most of the base comes out," Yeager said. "You go out there and you look at the swimming pool and you think back over the years and you think about Pancho and her husband, Mac McKendry, and some of the people who used to come out there. When I was flying the X-1, I was only getting $260 a month. The way we looked at it, duty was our guideline. That's the way we all flew in the military." See Yeager at Happy Bottom Visitors at Edwards are not allowed access to the Happy Bottom ruins, a base spokesman said. But free tours of other areas of the base are available -- by appointment only -- twice a month. Highlights include the Air Force Flight Test Center Museum, the food court and gift shop at the NASA Dryden Flight Research Center and a "windshield tour" near the flight line where F-16s, KC-135s, F-22s, F-35s, B-1s or C-17s might be visible, said the spokesman. The Air Force Flight Test Center Museum features a full size replica of Yeager's plane (the real one hangs in the Smithsonian) and actual aircraft that made the region famous. In nearby Palmdale, locally developed and tested aviation gems can be found at The Joe Davies Heritage Airpark. Then there's the dream factory of aviation geeks: Skunk Works. It's the official nickname of Lockheed Martin's Advanced Development Programs. Entire books have been written about this facility, which gave birth to the Blackbird and other historic aircraft. Nowadays, behind Skunk Works' highly secure perimeter, engineers reportedly are working on the aviation wonders of tomorrow, including a lightweight cargo plane called the X-55A and a bizarre, blimp-like airship called the P-791 Hybrid Air Vehicle, which has special technology that allows it to take off and land just about anywhere. Check it out here No public tours are available, but aerospace blogger Steve Harris posted some juicy details about his private visit to Skunk Works. For those who can't get in, Harris told me he only got to see "about 15 or 20 percent of what they could show us. Everything else is something that we don't even know exists." Outside the property, you can see Skunk Works' "big, giant, white, box-of-a-building" easily. The Skunk Works small gift shop is open to the public about a mile or so down the road. Geeky? Perhaps. Boneyard Next, I'd have to travel from the birthplace of aviation icons to the place where they go to die. That would be a hunk of desert near Tucson, Arizona, known as "The Boneyard." The Air Force calls it 309 AMARG -- The 309th Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Group (formerly known as AMARC). It's basically the Pentagon's 2,600-acre parking lot for about 5,000 retired military aircraft. It's sort of like a classic-car junkyard where all the town gearheads want to hang out and pull parts for their customized vehicles. The place where dead airplanes come back to life Access to this place is restricted, but nearby Pima Air & Space Museum offers tours of the Boneyard and -- for geeks with deep pockets -- several companies at Tucson's airport sell scenic Boneyard flyovers, says Chris Slack, who runs Boneyard website amarcExperience.com. Geek bonus: The Boneyard served as a scene location for the 2009 film "Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen." I'd definitely hit Pima Air & Space, by the way. It's got 300 choice aircraft -- like several Soviet-designed MiG fighter jets, a Blackbird and an F-111 Aardvark, the first Air Force jet with "swing wings." Fast and last Seattle's Museum of Flight has some real beauties, including a unique Blackbird variant called the M-21. This particular Blackbird was able to launch unpiloted drones that were used for independent intelligence gathering. Geek trivia: Although it was developed in the 1960s, the Blackbird still holds the record as the fastest "air-breathing" jet plane in history with a velocity more than 2,100 mph, three times the speed of sound. What else does the Museum of Flight have? Something for aviation geeks AND politics geeks: a Boeing 707-200 that served as the first jet-powered Air Force One. This is kinda cool: parked outside the museum is the last supersonic Concorde jetliner to make a commercial flight. It's really not that geeky -- OK? This thing is the world's fastest jetliner for God's sake. We're talking about cruise speeds above 1,000 mph, compared with regular airliners, like Boeing's new 787, that poke along at under 600 mph. Tail-dragger Here's something a suspected aviation geek could do during a quick layover at Dallas-Fort Worth International: check out a painstakingly restored 72-year-old DC-3 airliner. The Flagship Knoxville, the shiny silver centerpiece of American Airlines' C.R. Smith Museum, is about a 10-minute cab ride south of DFW. As everyone who's boarded one knows, the DC-3 is a tail-dragger. The plane's tail is designed to sit on the ground, so when you step aboard the aircraft you find yourself on a steep incline. It reminds you how far commercial aviation has come. Meal carts? Nah, not for DC-3 "stewardesses." They carried meal trays one-by-one to each of the plane's 21 passengers. That must have been fun during turbulence. Hands-on More old-school aviation geekiness: I need to visit Florida's Fantasy of Flight, about 45 minutes southwest of Orlando. This place features World War I and II-era aircraft, and its website says it's the only attraction in the world that offers daily aerial demonstrations. For a price, pilots will take passengers for short flights on vintage aircraft. Not daring enough? For daredevils, a pilot will take you up in a Boeing Stearman PT-17, which has duel controls. The pilot will let you take the controls and fly the plane. Am I interested? Um, yes please. Geeky? So what. Sign me up.

For the powerful congressional Republicans who will actually determine the size of the defense budget, it’s nowhere near enough. Legal services in unprecedented danger under Trump's budget proposal Read more One of the only departments to escape cuts in Trump’s budget proposal, submitted formally to Congress on Thursday, the defense department has long been telegraphed by Trump as a recipient of a windfall. Trump’s proposals request $639bn for defense, comprising $65bn in war funding atop $574bn in the so-called “base” Pentagon funding, up from $587bn in Barack Obama’s final defense budget request. The base budget funds the major expenses within US military spending, such as troop pay and healthcare; maintaining the military’s hardware; and purchasing the ships and planes about which Trump has waxed enthusiastic. Actual warfare in Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria and beyond is funded separately, an accounting trick that has made US defense spending, by far the highest in the world, appear lower than it is. Trump’s military budget proposal is well above the “sequestration” caps imposed under a much-lamented 2011 agreement between Barack Obama and the Republican Congress, but it came immediately under attack on Capitol Hill from defense hawks, not defense doves. “It is clear that this budget proposed today cannot pass the Senate,” said John McCain, the Arizona Republican chairman of the Senate armed services committee. Trump budget: food vouchers for hundreds of thousands of women and children at risk Read more McCain’s counterpart in the House, Republican Mac Thornberry of Texas, sounded similar notes, though softer in tone than McCain, a frequent critic of Trump. “Unfortunately, the administration’s budget request is not enough to repair that damage and to rebuild the military as the president has discussed,” Thornberry said on Thursday. McCain and Thornberry run committees that, along with the defense appropriations subcommittees, review, revise and shepherd through Congress the annual defense budget and shape its specific details. Their early and vocal opposition to Trump’s proposal signals that it is unlikely to be adopted by Congress in its current form. The Republican chairmen, who are both close to the defense secretary, James Mattis, are pushing for a vastly larger defense budget. Arguing that Trump’s proposal insufficiently redresses claimed shortfalls in readiness – McCain’s math claims Trump is proposing a 3% real increase from Obama, not the 10% the White House claims – they are pushing a $640bn defense budget for the coming year and similarly substantial increases in future years. Antonio Guterres, the secretary-general of the UN, responded to Trump’s budget proposal by saying “more than military spending” was needed to combat terrorism. “There is also a need to address the underlying drivers of terrorism through continuing investments in conflict prevention, conflict resolution, countering violent extremism, peacekeeping, peacebuilding, sustainable and inclusive development, the enhancement and respect of human rights, and timely responses to humanitarian crises,” his spokesman Stephane Dujarric said. Though it receives an outsized portion of non-entitlement spending, the Pentagon has for decades been unable to pass an audit, causing countless budget watchers to warn of military waste. One recent internal study documented $125bn, over a five-year period, in administrative waste alone. Trump budget would gut EPA programs tackling climate change and pollution Read more Trump is also requesting a $2.8bn increase to the Department of Homeland Security’s budget, to $44bn, and $4.4bn more to the Department of Veterans Affairs, to $79bn. In addition to the defense budget proposal, Trump on Thursday announced his selections for senior positions at the Pentagon supporting Mattis, which had been tied up in infighting between the Pentagon and White House. Pending Senate approval, Boeing’s vice-president, Patrick Shanahan, will be Mattis’s deputy, responsible for the Pentagon’s day-to-day operations. Trump made a high-profile visit to a South Carolina Boeing plant last month, threatened the company over the cost of manufacturing Air Force One and has praised Boeing’s F/A-18 Super Hornet fighter jet as an alternative to the expensive F-35 Joint Strike Fighter.

Those are just a few of the aspects of "astropreneurship" being discussed this weekend at MIT. The New Space Age conference is being held Saturday at the Samberg Conference Center. The discussion focuses on the new space race as private companies continue to create and expand a new commercial market for space travel. Participants will discuss making space travel affordable to the public, sharing the cost of space access and the relationship between private space companies and governments. Speakers will include: Jeffrey Hoffman, a former NASA astronaut who is director of MIT's Man Vehicle Lab, Naveed Hussain, vice president of aeromechanics technology for The Boeing Company and Sean Casey, founder and managing director of the Silicon Valley Space Center.
