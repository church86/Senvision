A NASA deal with Boeing gives the space agency access to up to five additional Soyuz seats, including three in 2019. Credit: Victor Zelentsov/NASA WASHINGTON — NASA has quietly signed a contract with Boeing for up to five additional Soyuz seats to provide for both additional U.S. crewmembers on the International Space Station and margin for commercial crew delays. NASA made the deal in a modification to the Vehicle Sustaining Engineering Contract the agency has with Boeing for ISS operations. Other than the formal contract modification notification, posted Feb. 21, NASA did not announce the agreement beyond a statement published without fanfare on the agency's website. The agreement covers two Soyuz seats on flights in the fall of 2017 and spring of 2018, with the option for three seats on Soyuz flights in 2019. The total value of the contract modification, including the optional seats, is $373.5 million, or an average of $74.7 million per seat. NASA's most recent contract with the Russian state space corporation Roscosmos for six Soyuz seats on 2018 missions has an average per-seat price of $81.7 million. NASA disclosed in a Jan. 17 procurement filing that it was evaluating an unsolicited proposal from Boeing for the Soyuz seats. Boeing obtained the seats from Russian company RSC Energia as part of a settlement between the two companies for a legal dispute involving Sea Launch. Boeing won a judgment of more than $320 million against Energia from a federal court in May 2016, but subsequent legal filings indicated that the two companies were negotiating a settlement. The procurement filing was a procedural step before NASA and Boeing could begin negotiations for the sole-source contract. In mid-February, Boeing officials said negotiations with NASA for the Soyuz seats were ongoing. The near-term seats take advantage of open seats on Soyuz flights created after Roscosmos announced plans to temporarily reduce the size of its crew from three to two people, a move that takes effect in April. An additional U.S. crewmember, NASA claims, can result in a 50 percent increase in overall crew time for research on the ISS. NASA has planned to add an additional crewmember once commercial crew vehicles, capable of carrying four or more people at a time, entered service. NASA has not disclosed who will fly to the station on those two near-term Soyuz seats. "Crew assignments are going through the standard process that all [ISS] Expedition assignments follow," NASA spokesman Dan Huot said Feb. 27. "Once that process has been completed, we'll announce the assignments." The compressed timeframe would likely limit the available astronauts for those near-term seats to those who are already training or have recently completed training as backups for missions, or those who have recently flown missions themselves. Crew selections are typically made a year or more in advance of the missions: on Jan. 4, NASA announced that astronauts Drew Feustel and Jeanette Epps would fly to the ISS in March and May of 2018, respectively. The options for three seats in 2019 provide a cushion for NASA to ensure access to the ISS should commercial crew vehicles under development by Boeing and SpaceX suffer delays. "Although both commercial crew vehicles are on track right now to start flying in 2019, it seemed to us it might make sense to NASA to have some insurance just in case," John Elbon, vice president and general manager of space exploration at Boeing, said in a Jan. 17 interview. A U.S. Government Accountability Office report Feb. 16 concluded that Boeing and SpaceX were likely to suffer additional delays in the development of their commercial crew vehicles, delaying their NASA certification from the second half of 2018 until 2019. NASA, in a response to the report, said it was developing a contingency plan for ISS access that would be completed by March 13. Since the report, executives with both Boeing and SpaceX have argued that their vehicles remain on schedule for test flights planned for late this year through the middle of 2018. SpaceX Chief Executive Elon Musk reiterated plans to fly NASA astronauts in 2018 during a Feb. 27 conference call with reporters to discuss his company's plan to send two people on a circumlunar mission in late 2018, a mission he said would fly after SpaceX's first crewed missions to the ISS. A potential gap in access had concerned NASA and its advisors, given that it was too late using traditional procurement methods for NASA to purchase Soyuz seats directly from Roscosmos for 2019 missions. The Boeing deal has relieved at some of those people. "It was good to assure accessibility to ISS and take some schedule pressure off, as it was being perceived, on commercial crew," said James Bagian, a member of the NASA Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel, during a Feb. 23 meeting of the panel at the Kennedy Space Center, alluding to the Boeing deal. "While we want commercial crew to proceed with all due haste, we don't want schedule to have unnecessary pressure that could compromise safety."

'Not that you can't do it, it's just that they haven't done it yet,' says astronaut Chris Hadfield By Nicole Mortillaro, CBC News Posted: Mar 03, 2017 4:28 PM ET Last Updated: Mar 03, 2017 7:19 PM ET SpaceX announced that it will carry two space tourists around the moon by 2018.

SpaceX CEO Elon Musk has announced the company plans to send two private citizens into orbit around the moon by 2018. But how realistic is Musk's goal? In the aerospace industry, there's a saying: space is hard. It may seem like an obvious conclusion, but the challenges of such a project are unlike those in any other type of industry. And while SpaceX has certainly proven that it can overcome hurdles, there's a lot the private company needs to address before sending people to orbit the moon. SpaceX to fly 2 people around the moon by next year SpaceX rocket explodes on launch pad One big one is that SpaceX hasn't launched a crewed vehicle into space. Along with Boeing, SpaceX is contracted for the next generation of crewed vehicles that will send people to the International Space Station. The first unmanned test of their Crew Dragon spacecraft is slated for the end of 2017. But that's unlikely to happen: on Feb. 16, the U.S. Government Accountability Office noted delays by Boeing and SpaceX, stating that, if they continue, both companies could see their certifications to fly people into space delayed until 2019.  This artist's concept shows a SpaceX Crew Dragon docking with the International Space Station, as it would during a mission for NASA's Commercial Crew Program. (SpaceX) Then there's the rocket. SpaceX has had great success with its Falcon 9, but it still hasn't tested the Falcon 9 Heavy. Once completed, the Heavy will be the most powerful rocket in the world. SpaceX boasts it "restores the possibility of flying missions with crew to the moon or Mars." But the Heavy is well behind schedule: it was originally slated for a test flight in mid 2015. The date was moved three times in 2016, and now it has been pushed back from early 2017 to mid-2017.  Based on these two crucial steps to getting people to the moon, it appears that a date that is just over a year away could pose a challenge. Still, it doesn't mean it's impossible. 'What you're doing is taking these guys and putting them in bed for total bed rest for six days.' — Richard Hughson, space researcher SpaceX has been setting ambitious goals from the start, having launched several crew resupply missions and even landing the first stage of its Falcon 9 rocket back on Earth. "Five years ago, even three years ago, that would have been an audacious, crazy fantasy," Canadian astronaut Chris Hadfield told CBC News. "And yet now, people are sort of disappointed when it doesn't work perfectly. So I wouldn't discount it." NASA pays $80 million a seat Going to space is not only hard, it's expensive. At the moment, with no crew launch vehicle of their own, NASA is dishing out roughly $80 million per seat to the Russians in order to get its astronauts to the ISS. The cost for a SpaceX mission to the station is estimated to be around $58 million. In the 1960s, the cost of the entire Apollo program was roughly $20 billion (not adjusted to today's value). While Musk isn't proposing a lunar program yet (give him time), it's still going to cost millions of dollars to get there. In 2009, Cirque du Soleil founder Guy Laliberté paid $35 million to Space Adventures Ltd. to hitch a ride on a Russian Soyuz rocket to the ISS. ​ Canadian spaceflight participant Guy Laliberté (centre) aboard the International Space Station on Oct. 2, 2009 with, left to right, Nicole Stott, Jeffrey Williams, Michael Barratt and European Space Agency astronaut Frank De Winne. (NASA Handout/Reuters) Obviously getting to the moon will be a lot more expensive. But clearly, the two individuals who have paid SpaceX have the money to do it. Still, the question will be whether SpaceX can continue to send astronauts to the ISS and these seemingly frivolous trips to the moon. ​Physical effects Human bodies were not built for space. We can't even go to a altitude of 8,000 metres without almost killing ourselves. Heading in the other direction, even with breathing apparatus, at a depth of about 30 metres our bodies begin to feel the effects of the change in pressure. Going to space for any length of time creates even more challenges. Richard Hughson, senior director of research at the  Schlegel-University of Waterloo Research Institute for Aging, studies the effects of space on astronauts. There are a lot of effects, including decreased bone density, cardiovascular responses, eyesight changes and muscle atrophy. The effects are seen in astronauts in long missions, such as those spending six months on the ISS, but they begin almost as soon as an astronaut becomes weightless. If the trip to the moon is about the same as the Apollo missions, it would last six days. While this is a fraction of the time astronauts spend on the ISS, the SpaceX passengers are likely to experience some of the effects, including muscle atrophy. Chris Hadfield performing a periodic fitness evaluation during his stay on the International Space Station. Astronauts need to exercise in order to prevent muscle atrophy and bone degeneration. (NASA) "Essentially what you're doing is taking these guys and putting them in bed for total bed rest for six days," Hughson told CBC News. Then there's the issue of radiation: astronauts in low-Earth orbit are shielded by our magnetic field against harmful cosmic rays. Anyone heading to the moon doesn't have the luxury.  Last year, a study found Apollo astronauts were five times more likely to die from heart disease compared to shuttle astronauts. What will be the effects on the SpaceX passengers? Space tourism SpaceX has said it is already training the future astronauts and plan to do more flights like this one, with the ultimate destination of Mars. Hadfield said Musk`s timeline is likely to be moved. "It's not that you can't do it, it's just that they haven't done it yet," he said. And while Musk is renowned for setting ambitious goals, it doesn't make the prospect of ordinary (and extremely wealthy) citizens any less exciting. People like the two passengers, Hadfield said, are opening the doors to making space more accessible.  "I think the people who help finance that mission will get that sort of pride out of it," he said. "Not just the bragging-rights pictures, but also that the fruit of their labour is going to help enable the moon to be part of the much more normal human experience here within this next generation. That's pretty exciting."

Top officials of the state government held discussions with representatives of Boeing recently. Availability of land close to Bengaluru, tax incentives and special packages the government can offer to the company were discussed. But nothing has been finalised yet, nor has the company submitted a formal proposal to the government on its investment plans, sources in the government said. “We are holding talks with Boeing. The company has plans to set up a new manufacturing facility near Bengaluru. Talks are still in preliminary stages,” Industries Minister R V Deshpande told DH. The minister, however, refused to divulge details on the company’s investment plans. Boeing recently launched its Engineering and Technology Centre in Bengaluru. A few months ago, the US aircraft manufacturer had revealed that it was keen on investing in a new futuristic Indian factory under the ‘Make in India’ initiative. The company had said that it wants to create an entire aviation ecosystem for building its fighter aircraft, F/A-18 Super Hornet. The F/A-18 Super Hornet is a twin-engine, supersonic, multirole fighter jet capable of landing and taking off from an aircraft carrier. But it is not clear whether the company is holding talks with the state government on establishing the factory near Bengaluru. AP too is wooing Sources in the Commerce and Industries department said that neighbouring Andhra Pradesh is also wooing Boeing to invest there. Andhra Pradesh has been aggressive in attracting investments. But, the Karnataka government is not lagging behind in this regard. Karnataka has an edge over other states as Bengaluru is an aviation hub, the sources added. The sources said one of the reasons for the state government to hurriedly approve a proposal to relax land allotment rules for industrial purposes, is to compete with Andhra Pradesh in attracting Boeing. Projects coming in single unit complex bracket will get land on lease-cum-sale basis and absolute sale deed for the land will be issued to the investor after 15 years, as per the government’s decision. Hitherto, land for industrial purposes was given only on 99 years lease. The Andhra Pradesh government has already simplified its land allotment rules.   Tweet Go to Top Videos Kansas killing: Bengaluru residents stage candlelight vigil Tokens from History: An exhibition of rare coins comes to Bengaluru Cabbies on Strike: Ola and Uber drivers begin fast Meet the Skycats: They perform death-defying stunts at 15,000 ft Daredevil Birds: Breathtaking aerobatic displays at Aero India Beauty in the Sky: Aero India begins with dazzling display Aero India 2017( Feb 14-18) India Upbeat Menthya Gojju Pudi (Methi Gravy powder) Bow wow! : A park designed for doggies Videos Congress, SP, BSP have different culture of...

Boeing has earned multiple pats on the back from Trump in the past few weeks including a "God Bless Boeing" acclaim at the end of that South Carolina speech, while its CEO Dennis Muilenburg has become downright chummy with the president. In light of Trump's America First agenda, it deserves some of that praise: Boeing is the largest U.S. exporter and pays good wages for high-level manufacturing work. And yet, Boeing's employment numbers aren't exactly moving in the direction that a president who bills himself as a job saver might want.In December—a full two months before Trump's effusive praise on the factory floor—the $113 billion plane maker told employees that tough competition and fewer sales opportunities in commercial aerospace after years of booming demand would force it to ramp up layoffs. A plan to trim 8 percent of that division's workforce in 2016 implied 6,600 job cuts. On Thursday, we learned some details as to how many more positions could be eliminated this year: Boeing approved 1,500 voluntary layoffs for mechanics, while 305 engineers and technical workers are also leaving voluntarily, per Bloomberg News.Boeing has said it may also have to consider involuntary cuts. Who knows how many jobs might eventually be rendered unnecessary by the robotics and automation Boeing's CEO said this week are crucial to new product innovation and maintaining U.S. leadership in aerospace and defense...

Follow @blsuth Facebook Twitter Email Print Share March 3, 2017 12:41 PM EST BOEING CO/THE -1.25 At Closing, March 6th 180.93 USD CATERPILLAR INC +0.54 At Closing, March 6th 95.66 USD As President Donald Trump visited a Boeing Co. factory two weeks ago and pledged to "fight for every last American job," the aerospace giant was working on cutting more than 1,000 positions.   Boeing has earned multiple pats on the back from Trump in the past few weeks including a "God Bless Boeing" acclaim at the end of that South Carolina speech, while its CEO Dennis Muilenburg has become downright chummy with the president. In light of Trump's America First agenda, it deserves some of that praise: Boeing is the largest U.S. exporter and pays good wages for high-level manufacturing work. And yet, Boeing's employment numbers aren't exactly moving in the direction that a president who bills himself as a job saver might want. Trending Down Total employment at Boeing has been declining over the past few years Source: Bloomberg, company filings In December -- a full two months before Trump's effusive praise on the factory floor -- the $113 billion plane maker told employees that tough competition and fewer sales opportunities in commercial aerospace after years of booming demand would force it to ramp up layoffs. A plan to trim 8 percent of that division's workforce in 2016 implied 6,600 job cuts. On Thursday, we learned some details as to how many more positions could be eliminated this year: Boeing approved 1,500 voluntary layoffs for mechanics, while 305 engineers and technical workers are also leaving voluntarily, per Bloomberg News. Air Brakes Analysts are forecasting a slowdown in Boeing sales after several years of big growth on the back of the booming commercial aerospace demand Source: Bloomberg Boeing has said it may also have to consider involuntary cuts. Who knows how many jobs might eventually be rendered unnecessary by the robotics and automation Boeing's CEO said this week are crucial to new product innovation and maintaining U.S. leadership in aerospace and defense. Boeing isn't doing anything wrong. To keep paying workers that it doesn't need flies directly in the face of free-market capitalism and would surely irk shareholders who are already worried about cash flow and margins. And it does need to invest in technology and automation to make its business more efficient and stay competitive. It's just another reminder that corporate realities will likely force even Trump-approved companies to make decisions he doesn't like. Caterpillar Inc., of "I love Caterpillar" fame, is another example. Here's what the company's head of investor relations Amy Campbell had to say earlier this week: “Our strategy has been to build where we sell product, and so we build Chinese product in China. I think if there was a desire to build that product in the U.S., I don’t know that the Chinese would be all that excited to accept it back in China.” Beyond that, the manufacturing jobs that Caterpillar provided 40 years ago just don't exist anymore because of automation, she said. Taxing Times Caterpillar shares slumped on news of the raid at its offices. But this made-of-Teflon stock was actually up slightly on Friday. Source: Bloomberg Intraday times are displayed in ET. Trump may have other reasons to be disappointed in Caterpillar these days, after multiple government agencies raided the construction-machinery maker's offices this week. The raid appears at least partly connected with a probe into Caterpillar tax policies that a Senate investigative committee in 2014 found allowed it to avoid paying $2.4 billion in taxes. Caterpillar told the committee it had complied with U.S. tax laws and now says it's cooperating with authorities. While Trump has acknowledged he used legal loopholes to avoid paying personal federal income taxes, he's also said that companies that pursue other tax-saving moves like inversions "have no loyalty to this country." There's a pattern of contradictions here. Broad promises to save every U.S. manufacturing job could actually work against Trump's objective to make America "start winning again." Perhaps Trump himself has realized this and that's why we haven't heard any Twitter rants about these Boeing job reductions. He also seems to have backed off -- or forgotten? -- earlier criticism about Boeing's "massive" plant in China. (It's not massive). While Trump lamented the loss of factories since China joined the World Trade Organization to a joint session of Congress this week, he's had no specific public words for Boeing or Caterpillar on this matter lately. Except the broad platitudes keep coming and in the end, that's hampering a real discussion about the effect of globalization and technology on manufacturing and the investments that are needed in education and training. Tax reform and fewer regulations alone aren't going to cut it.    This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners. The closest thing Boeing has had to a big-league jobs announcement since Trump's election victory was a December proclamation that Iran's national airline's order for 80 aircraft would "support" nearly 100,000 U.S. jobs within "the U.S. aerospace value stream." Translation: thanks to this new influx of money, there's now less of a risk that 100,000 people employed at Boeing or its suppliers will have to be laid off. If Trump succeeds in ramping up defense spending, that could create jobs in other parts of Boeing's business. But the potential for a defense-related stimulus hasn't stopped him from attacking other companies' job plans (see: United Technologies Corp.'s Carrier division).   Boeing builds airplane interiors specifically designated for that market and the billions of dollars in sales Boeing has gotten from China over the years help support U.S. manufacturing jobs.

The DOT proposal detailed how the agency would reallocate flight “slots” that Delta and Aeromexico were required to give up at Mexico City and JFK in order to win approval for a joint-venture business relationship. In exchange for the approval, the department required the airlines to surrender government permits for 24 pairs of takeoffs and landings at Mexico City’s airport and additional slot pairs at JFK. The goal was to prevent the airlines from dominating those congested and popular airports because they would have controlled half the slots at Mexico City. Alaska Airlines, JetBlue and Southwest tentatively received multiple slots to add service at Mexico City’s main international airport. JetBlue received six “slot pairs” while Alaska and Southwest each got four.

In aviation vernacular, a “slot” refers to a takeoff or landing spot at airports where schedule are capacity controlled. A “slot pair” would give an airline the ability to perform one round-trip flight. Per the proposal, the airlines receiving the 24 Mexico City slots would use them to fly more than a dozen routes from the Mexican capital. (Scroll down for the full list) The DOT also proposed reallocating the six slots Delta and Aeromexico are giving up at New York JFK. Those would go to Mexican low-cost carriers that currently have a small presence there. VivaAerobus would get two slot pairs at JFK while Interjet and Volaris would get one. All of those slots would be used for Mexico City service, per the DOT's Show Cause order. The slot reallocation would occur in two phases, with 14 Mexico City and two JFK slots changing hands this year and the rest in 2018.

By Ed Adamczyk   |   March 3, 2017 at 10:47 AM Follow @upi Comments | License Photo March 3 (UPI) -- More than 1,800 unionized employees of Boeing will leave the company through voluntary buyouts, two unions announced. Personnel cuts in Boeing's commercial aircraft division, where the formerly Seattle-based company has about half of its 75,000 employees, were announced in December. The International Association of Machinists, which represents workers in Washington State, said about 1,500 of its members will accept the offered buyouts, which include a week of severance pay for every year of service and six months of medical coverage. The Society of Professional Engineering Employees in Aerospace, representing engineers and aircraft inspectors, said 305 members will also accept buyouts, involving the same severance pay but only three months of medical coverage. Nonunion employees were also offered buyouts, but Boeing did not offer information on how many accepted the offer. Boeing cut 7,400 jobs at its Washington State plants in 2016, and Ray Conner, vice chairman of the company, warned in December that additional cuts would follow, citing "fewer sales opportunities and tougher competition." In 2016, Boeing slashed 2,100 jobs held by machinists' union members, all through attrition or voluntary buyouts. Bill Dugovich of the engineers' union said Boeing told union officials to expect 2017 personnel reductions to be "in line with last year." About 1,200 members of the engineers' union lost their jobs at Boeing in 2016, 350 coming through involuntary layoffs. Boeing spokesman Paul Bergman said additional cuts are expected, commenting, "Every few months, there's going to be another group going through this." In February, President Donald Trump visited a non-union Boeing plant in South Carolina as it unveiled the company's newest plane. "Already, American industry is roaring back.

Computing Mobile Internet Gaming Electronics Extreme Deep Dives Deals About ExtremeTech ET Forums Contact ExtremeTech Terms of Use Privacy Policy Ziff Davis Home Extreme NASA secures up to five more seats on Russian Soyuz missions NASA secures up to five more seats on Russian Soyuz missions By Ryan Whitwam on March 3, 2017 at 7:30 am Comment NASA is hoping to begin sending astronauts up to the International Space Station in the coming years with the aid of private space firms like SpaceX and Boeing. However, the agency is planning for the worst and securing an alternate means of transport. No, the Shuttle isn’t being brought out of mothball. NASA has inked a deal with Russian space agency Roscosmos (via Boeing) for as many as five more seats on Soyuz capsules. Boeing acted as an intermediary for NASA on this deal, which covers two confirmed seats for launches in March and September of 2018. That’s before the expected start of the Commercial Crew Program that will see the SpaceX Dragon 2 and Boeing CST-100 take humans into space on ISS runs. There have been a few delays in these programs, so NASA is hedging its bets. The two confirmed round-trip seats will cost NASA $74.7 million. But hey, that includes checked luggage! This figure is slightly less than the $81.7 million Russia got the last time the agency booked travel in 2015. The savings are largely thanks to Boeing’s involvement. Russia recently decided to lower its ISS crew complement from three to two cosmonauts, which freed up some spots. Boeing got access to the seats as part of a long-running legal battle with Russian space contractor RSC Energia. The American firm was apparently willing to let them go for less than Russia would have. What about the other three seats? NASA has the option to buy them, if there’s a need. These will be for launches in 2019 and beyond. At that time, the Commercial Crew Program should be up and running. The first manned test flights of Dragon 2 and CST-100 for NASA are currently targeting the middle of 2018 for manned flights, but that schedule might not hold. SpaceX Dragon V2 In the event these spacecraft are not ready by 2019, NASA will have those three extra seats available for purchase. One or two of them might go to astronauts from the ESA, JAXA, or another spaceflight partner for which NASA handles transport to the ISS. NASA and Roscosmos have agreed on a “ride-sharing” arrangement when the Commercial Crew Program is up and running. At least one American will be on each Soyuz launch and one Russian will be on each SpaceX or Boeing launch. This ensures at least one crew member from each nation is on the ISS at all times. The cost for NASA to reach the ISS should go down dramatically when it can buy seats from SpaceX and Boeing.

Boeing has approved the first wave of voluntary layoffs for union workers. (GeekWire Photo) Boeing has approved buyouts for  more than 1,800 union workers, marking the start of a new round of job reductions that’s expected to continue through the year. The voluntary layoffs include 1,500 machinists and 305 engineers, representatives of the workers’ unions told GeekWire today. Boeing Commercial Airplanes is reducing non-union positions as well, but the company isn’t providing numbers for those classifications. The company said in December that it would have to continue last year’s downward trend in employment to stay competitive with Airbus, its European aerospace rival. Last year’s job reductions amounted to about 8 percent of the workforce in Boeing’s commercial airplane division, going from roughly 82,500 to a little more than 76,000 employees by the end of 2016. The reductions were achieved through voluntary and involuntary layoffs as well as attrition. About 1,200 engineers were laid off during all of last year, said Bill Dugovich, a spokesman for the Society of Professional Engineering Employees in Aerospace, or SPEEA. He said 350 of those layoffs were involuntary. Dugovich expects this year’s totals to be about the same. “We know there’s going to be more,” he said. A spokeswoman for Machinists Union District 751, Connie Kelliher, said her union doesn’t know how many more will be laid off this year. She said about 1,000 machinists took voluntary buyouts last year, but there were no forced layoffs. The 1,800-plus buyouts that were approved as of the end of February will take effect over the course of the rest of the year, typically starting in April. Laid-off machinists are to receive one week’s pay for every year of service, up to 26 weeks of pay, plus six months of standard medical benefits, Kelliher said. Engineers will get similar levels of severance pay, but typically only three months of standard medical benefits. Those who are laid off due to a shift in work location could get more, Dugovich said.

Mariella Moon, @mariella_moon 03.03.17 in Space Comments 376 Shares Share Tweet Share Save Virgin Orbit Richard Branson's Virgin Group now has three private space companies. The newest addition is called Virgin Orbit, and it will focus on low-cost small satellite launches based on the company's LauncherOne system. If you'll recall, LauncherOne uses a two-stage rocket dropped from a carrier aircraft. Its earlier iterations could only carry up to 500 pounds of payload. Orbit will use a modified Boeing 747 called "Cosmic Girl" that'll allow the system to ferry a bigger rocket with heavier cargo to Low Earth Orbit. The new company already has a 180,000-square-foot manufacturing facility in Long Beach, California that employs 200 employees, since LauncherOne has been operating under Virgin Galactic for quite some time now. Virgin Orbit, however, will be headed by Dan Hart, who was with Boeing for 34 years before Branson's group recruited him. He served as Boeing's Vice President of Government Satellite Systems, leading the development of various aerospace products. Branson said his company has been striving to make space more accessible "by manufacturing vehicles of the future, enabling the small satellite revolution and preparing commercial space flight for many more humans to reach space and see our home planet." Going forward, Virgin Galactic will focus on human spaceflight as Orbit takes over smallsat launches. The Spaceship Company, Virgin Group's other space venture, will continue designing and testing aerospace vehicles. Virgin Group promises to reveal more info about its new spinoff in the coming months, complete with new websites to establish Orbit's brand identity.

Boeing Co has accepted 1,880 voluntary layoffs from its union machinists and engineers in the Seattle area, the unions said on Thursday, part of the jet maker's drive to cut costs through job reductions and other measures. Boeing's machinists union, the touch labor that builds airplanes near Seattle, said about 1,575 workers had taken voluntary layoffs by the deadline in February. Boeing's white-collar union said Boeing accepted 305 members for voluntary layoffs in January. Last year, Boeing cut about 1,200 white-collar union jobs - 850 through voluntary layoffs and 350 through involuntary reductions, said Bill Dugovich, spokesman for the Society of Professional Engineering Employees in Aerospace. "Boeing has told us to expect about the same number of total layoffs in 2017 as 2016," he said. The job reductions had been announced last year and workers had until Feb. 1 to apply. "These are all voluntary, where people planned to retire or had other plans," said Connie Kelliher, a spokeswoman for the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers District 751. Cost-cutting drive Boeing said it did not have a specific target number for its job reductions at the commercial airplane unit but was sticking with the broad plan of reducing jobs it outlined in December. "We are reducing costs and aligning employment levels to business and market requirements," spokesman Paul Bergman said. "Employment reductions will come through a combination of attrition, leaving open positions unfilled, voluntary layoff program and in some cases, involuntary layoffs." Boeing offered the buyouts to workers last year as part of an 8 percent workforce reduction at its commercial airplane business. The unit had about 74,600 workers at the end of February. Boeing said in December it would cut an as-yet-undetermined number of jobs in 2017. No machinists have had involuntary layoffs for several years, Kelliher said. Boeing's shares closed down 0.5 percent at $182.99 on the New York Stock Exchange. Follow CNBC International on Twitter and Facebook. Related Securities Symbol Price   Change %Change BA ---

The Nairobi office will be headed by Chamsou Andjorin as Director for Government Affairs and Market Development. J. Miguel Santos, the Managing Director for sub-Saharan Africa, and Director of International Sales, Africa for Boeing Commercial Airplanes, will head the two new offices and is based in Johannesburg.

Since the introduction of the jet airplane, Boeing aircraft have formed the backbone of the continent's commercial fleet and Boeing continues to be one of the largest US-based companies doing business on the continent," he added. "The aerospace industry needs to start paying closer attention to Africa, because this continent is clearly on the move economically and all the trends are pointing in the right direction for the expansion of the sector.

Employees were notified this week that the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers union said it didn't know if this met Boeing's target or could still be followed by compulsory layoffs, the WSJ reported. (on.wsj.com/2litMDQ) "Employment reductions will come through a combination of attrition, leaving open positions unfilled, voluntary layoff program and in some cases, involuntary layoffs," a Boeing spokesman said, adding that the commercial airplane unit is cutting costs and aligning employment levels to business and market requirements. Boeing's commercial plane unit said in December that it would cut jobs in 2017. The unit slashed its workforce by 8 percent in 2016 as it struggled to sell planes in the face of a strong dollar.

  News Magazines Media Industry Directory Events Products   Home >> News: March 2nd, 2017 >> Story Satnews Daily March 2nd, 2017 Virgin Orbit enters the commercial space environs A new commercial space company has been given birth by Sir Richard Branson and Virgin Galactic — the name of the new firm is Virgin Orbit and the endeavor will be headed by Dan Hart as the first President of the company. Virgin Orbit will offer flexible, routine and low cost launch services for small satellites (smallsats) via the LauncherOne system. Virgin Orbit’s activities were previously conducted as a division of Virgin Galactic. Dan Hart joins Virgin Orbit after a distinguished 34 years at Boeing, where he was responsible for all of the company’s satellite programs for the US government and several allied countries. As Boeing’s Vice President of Government Satellite Systems, he led efforts in all phases of the aerospace product life cycle, from R&D through development, production and flight operations, and has supported numerous space launch missions across human spaceflight, satellite development, launch vehicle development, and missile defense. Virgin Orbit is headquartered in a state-of-the-art 180,000 square foot manufacturing facility in Long Beach, California, and employs a world class team of more than 200 experienced aerospace professionals. The company's vehicles include the LauncherOne rocket and its 747-400 flying launch pad, dubbed Cosmic Girl. The LauncherOne service already has a substantial order book, including both commercial and government customers. Virgin Orbit is the third company in Virgin Group’s commercial space portfolio, Galactic Ventures, led by CEO George T. Whitesides and owned by the Virgin Group and Aabar Investments PJS. The three companies are developing world-leading aerospace products and services in the following categories, each contributing to their shared vision of opening space to change the world for good. The announcements come as the LauncherOne small satellite launch system is in advanced phase of hardware testing for every subsystem and major component of the vehicle-having already conducted long duration, full thrust firings of both of LauncherOne’s engines, cryogenic tank tests, and hardware-in-the-loop testing of the vehicle’s avionics. Virgin Group Founder Sir Richard Branson said, "It has been my long held dream to open access to space to change the world for good. We have been striving to do that by manufacturing vehicles of the future, enabling the small satellite revolution, and preparing commercial space flight for many more humans to reach space and see our home planet. I’m thrilled that our small satellite launch service has now progressed to the point it merits the formation of its own company, Virgin Orbit, and a new president in Dan with decades of deep experience and success in a broad variety of space programs.” Galactic Ventures CEO George T. Whitesides added that Virgin Orbit will lead the world in responsive, affordable, dedicated launch for small satellites. This new organizational structure positions each Virgin space company to achieve its full potential while remaining true to our shared purpose of opening space to all. It is a testament to the Virgin Orbit team that we start this chapter with our newest space company led by an exceptional individual like Dan. Virgin Orbit President Dan Hart said, "The Virgin Galactic team has been boldly blazing the trail in a rapidly evolving space industry and I am thrilled to join the team. In 34 years at Boeing, I’ve had the honor to work on some of the most iconic and successful space programs in history including the Space Shuttle, the Delta launch program and satellite systems that have connected the world and protected our nation. Along the way, I’ve been privileged to work alongside incredibly talented engineers and industry leaders who have contributed to my own approach to innovation in space systems. The perfect next challenge is to lead Virgin Orbit’s entrepreneurial team through a transformative time for not only Virgin Orbit but also the industry. To me, the Virgin brand is about making life on Earth better, and we are going to fulfill that purpose by accessing Low Earth Orbit (LEO) to connect billions of people and enabling valuable applications of data from space through Virgin Orbit’s flexible, affordable, and reliable launch service.” virgingalactic.com/ thespaceshipcompany.com/ Topical Tags :  New Products    Manufacturing    Launch    Business Moves    SmallSat      Regional Tags :  North America                     FREE SUBSCRIPTIONS Today's Top News Sentinel-2B soars and monitors from the soil to the sky... Copernicus' Earth Observation mission  ULA to launch NASA's JPSS-2 mission AtlanTechRF reveals their Satellite Simulator Systems' new SNG series at D.C. trade event Draper's GN&C expertise to play a crucial role with SSL's government-owned satellite servicing mission Next-generation satellite terminal makes market entry from Hughes Network Systems More News A plethora of products from Teledyne Microwave Solutions (TMS) presented at D.C. show...

So we’re encouraged by that. And it was also a chance to show the value of aerospace on some of [his] economic initiatives.” “With the new administration coming onboard some of the opportunities to make the right political decisions—things like tax reform, trade policy, things that will enable aerospace growth—those are really important things to do,” Muilenburg said. “[With] engagement by all of us to get a few really important things done that allow us to invest in aerospace, to grow jobs, we have a window to do that.” Muilenburg also discussed the president’s opinion on Air Force One: “We have had a few conversations about Air Force One, including the current jet as well as the next generation Air Force One. Those have been very productive conversations. What I like is his direct engagement on the new Air Force One—talking about how we streamline requirements and certification, to get a better airplane, get it sooner, and to get it at lower cost.” “[These are] all good objectives,” Muilenburg said. “In fact it aligns with what we are trying to do more broadly and regulatory reform and how do we leverage things like commercial certification for military jets. I think that’s a great example of how we can drive efficiency and drive more economic growth.” Additionally, Muilenburg offered an assessment on Boeing’s investment in overseas manufacturing, particularly in China. “Just as we invest in jobs here in the US, we invest around the world to create sustainable presence in depth and that’s what I like to think of as a model of sustainable, value-added smart globalization,” Muilenburg said. “It’s the kind of investment that allows us to grow in the world while we grow here.” “In China we’re standing up the 737 finishing center and what that will do is take delivery of airplanes from our US manufacturing lines and then outfit them in final form for seats and paint for our Chinese customers,” Muilenburg said. “Now that’s value-added presence and depth in China. [And] it’s value-added depth here in the US and its part of what fuels our 737 production line and it’s a way for us to add job and grow around the world. That’s the kind of smart, sustainable globalization we like to think of. Globalization is not about moving jobs out of the US, it’s about making the right smart investment so we can grow jobs around the world.” “I think that kind of relationship with China, with a trade policy that supports it, is one that enables mutual growth. It’s good. It’s good for all of us,” Muilenburg said. “[If] we take a look at the future of the commercial airplane market over the next 20 years, we believe the world will need north of 39,000 new commercial airplanes. Around 6,800 of those are in China. It’s a very important market for the future and growing in China and sustaining the aerospace industry in China also allows us to grow jobs and add jobs in the US. It’s one of the reasons we’re ramping up our 737 production line.” Mark Nensel mark.nensel@penton.com Print reprints Favorite EMAIL Tweet Please Log In or Register to post comments.

Home World news Boeing gets 1,880 union workers to take voluntary layoffs Boeing gets 1,880 union workers to take voluntary layoffs Boeing has accepted 1,880 voluntary layoffs from its union machinists and engineers in the Seattle area, the unions said. By: Reuters | New Delhi | Published: March 3, 2017 5:45 AM Boeing’s machinists union, the touch labor that builds airplanes near Seattle, said about 1,575 workers had taken voluntary layoffs by the deadline in February. (Reuters)Boeing Co (BA.N) has accepted 1,880 voluntary layoffs from its union machinists and engineers in the Seattle area, the unions said on Thursday, part of the jet maker’s drive to cut costs through job reductions and other measures. Boeing’s white-collar union said Boeing accepted 305 members for voluntary layoffs in January. Last year, Boeing cut about 1,200 white-collar union jobs – 850 through voluntary layoffs and 350 through involuntary reductions, said Bill Dugovich, spokesman for the Society of Professional Engineering Employees in Aerospace. “Boeing has told us to expect about the same number of total layoffs in 2017 as 2016,” he said. The job reductions had been announced last year and workers had until Feb. 1 to apply. “These are all voluntary, where people planned to retire or had other plans,” said Connie Kelliher, a spokeswoman for the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers District 751. Boeing said it did not have a specific target number for its job reductions at the commercial airplane unit but was sticking with the broad plan of reducing jobs it outlined in December. “We are reducing costs and aligning employment levels to business and market requirements,” spokesman Paul Bergman said. “Employment reductions will come through a combination of attrition, leaving open positions unfilled, voluntary layoff program and in some cases, involuntary layoffs.” You may also like to watch this video Boeing offered the buyouts to workers last year as part of an 8 percent workforce reduction at its commercial airplane business. The unit had about 74,600 workers at the end of February. Boeing said in December it would cut an as-yet-undetermined number of jobs in 2017. Please Wait while comments are loading...

The Gresham facility will start making a component known as a flap actuation system, used to extend and retract wing flaps during flight. Boeing says the parts add lift for take-off or increase drag when an aircraft needs to slow down. Boeing employs more than 1,600 at its 87-acre site along Northeast Sandy Boulevard. The new work won’t bring additional jobs, according to the company, but enables the site to maintain its current size. “As we gain in productivity each year, if you don’t bring new work in then your size shrinks,” said Don Hendrickson, a Boeing finance manager in Gresham. The decision to stop outsourcing the work reflects improved manufacturing technology within Boeing, according to Hendrickson. He said the company is continually adding capabilities to its equipment, and so it’s now more efficient to do some work internally than to hire contractors. Boeing declined to say where the flap actuation system had been made previously. Boeing operates in Gresham under three separate packages of local property tax exemptions, including one that took effect last year valued at more than $10 million.

The planemaker approved voluntary layoffs for 1,500 mechanics, according to a person familiar with the situation who asked not to be named because it hasn’t been made public. Another 305 engineers and technical workers are leaving voluntarily, Bill Dugovich, a spokesman for their union, said Thursday.  Quotes in the article Boeing Co BA ▼ 180.93 -1.25 -0.69% Boeing told employees in December that it would seek buyouts as part of an effort to cut costs and match employment to market requirements, company spokesman Paul Bergman said by email. Boeing also plans to cull commercial-airplane jobs by leaving open positions unfilled and through involuntary layoffs, he said. He declined to say how many buyouts have been approved. The Chicago-based manufacturer has been winnowing employment in the Puget Sound area, its largest industrial base, over the past year as sales slowed for the jetliners, which accounted for 69 percent of total revenue last year. Boeing has trimmed its Washington state workforce by 9.2 percent to 71,036 since the start of last year even as Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg has emerged in meetings with President Donald Trump as an advocate for U.S. manufacturing. Those earlier cuts included about 1,000 members of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers and 850 members of the Society of Professional Engineering Employees in America who applied for voluntary layoffs. Another 350 SPEEA members lost their jobs involuntarily, Dugovich said. Boeing officials last week told the engineering union to “expect a similar reduction in workforce in our units as we experienced last year,” he said.

Boeing’s machinists union, the touch labor that builds airplanes near Seattle, said about 1,575 workers had taken voluntary layoffs by the deadline in February. Boeing’s white-collar union said Boeing accepted 305 members for voluntary layoffs in January. Last year, Boeing cut about 1,200 white-collar union jobs — 850 through voluntary layoffs and 350 through involuntary reductions, said Bill Dugovich, spokesman for the Society of Professional Engineering Employees in Aerospace. “Boeing has told us to expect about the same number of total layoffs in 2017 as 2016,” he said. The job reductions had been announced last year and workers had until Feb. 1 to apply. “These are all voluntary, where people planned to retire or had other plans,” said Connie Kelliher, a spokeswoman for the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers District 751. Cost-cutting drive Boeing said it did not have a specific target number for its job reductions at the commercial airplane unit but was sticking with the broad plan of reducing jobs it outlined in December. “We are reducing costs and aligning employment levels to business and market requirements,” spokesman Paul Bergman said. “Employment reductions will come through a combination of attrition, leaving open positions unfilled, voluntary layoff program and in some cases, involuntary layoffs.” Boeing offered the buyouts to workers last year as part of an 8 per cent workforce reduction at its commercial airplane business. The unit had about 74,600 workers at the end of February. Boeing said in December it would cut an as-yet-undetermined number of jobs in 2017. No machinists have had involuntary layoffs for several years, Kelliher said. Boeing’s shares closed down 0.5 per cent at US$182.99 on the New York Stock Exchange. — Reuters                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Global palm oil output seen rising 11pc in 2017 Bursa Malaysia rebounds to turn positive at mid-morning ECB meets under pressure as inflation tops target 20 years of tie-ups and break-ups among EU carmakers KL shares remain positive at mid-day Deutsche Bank board to meet Sunday to discuss capital hike KL Gateway Mall eyes full occupancy by end of Q2 2017 UK student accommodation remains top investment asset for Malaysians Boeing gets 1,880 union workers to take voluntary layoffs Rich Gen-Y Malaysian kids pool family fortunes for venture fund Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: ‘Babies’ on board for Beyonce and Jay Z Reuters Video: Obama, Richard Branson go kiteboarding Reuters Video: ‘The White Helmets’ filmmakers discuss ‘Muslim ban’ Reuters Video: ‘Babies’ on board for Beyonce and Jay Z Reuters Video: Obama, Richard Branson go kiteboarding Reuters Video: ‘The White Helmets’ filmmakers discuss ‘Muslim ban’ Related Articles Boeing’s US$14b Singapore Air order does not fill 777, 787 gap, says CEO Singapore Airlines to buy 39 Boeing planes worth US$13.8b Boeing front-runner for Singapore Airlines’ order Malaysia banks on aerospace sector to attract foreign investments Overseas ambitions, bumper plane orders test Vietnam’s ‘bikini airline’ Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2017 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | RecomN - Local Services

Spirit is asking for price cuts of 15 to 35 percent in meetings this week in Wichita, Kansas, where it is based, according to the sources and to a Feb. 13 letter Spirit sent to suppliers. Spirit declined to comment in response to questions from Reuters, beyond repeating a statement issued last month about its supplier negotiations. "All new contracts are on the table including local, domestic U.S. and international supply agreements," the statement said, noting Spirit is reviewing more than 50,000 parts it may move to new suppliers. The statement made no mention of specific price reductions Spirit is seeking or plans to move work overseas. Executives at supplier companies said Spirit is telling them in the meetings that they are bidding against U.S. and overseas rivals and against Spirit's own fabrication facilities. "They say, 'If you don't do this, we have other suppliers that will.' That's the leverage," said the chief executive of a U.S. metal parts supplier who met with Spirit recently. "There's a massive threat of offshoring and an additional threat of insourcing." Many suppliers learned about the re-bidding from Spirit's letter last month, according to the sources, who spoke in recent days and on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about contract details. At least one supplier already has lost all its work with Spirit, worth millions of dollars annually, to Asian suppliers who bid with lower prices, one of the sources said. Spirit's statement from last month said it is not tearing up existing contracts. "Spirit honors its contractual obligations. Our focus is on negotiating new contracts - well in advance of expiration," said the statement. But many Spirit contracts contain "termination for convenience" clauses that mean they can be ended at will, according to the sources and industry consultants. Spirit said its target prices for more than 50,000 parts are based on what materials, labor and overhead should cost if companies are sourcing efficiently and using the most modern production equipment. "We work collaboratively with our suppliers to help them achieve those targets," it said in the statement. If suppliers cannot hit the target, Spirit will outsource to others or take work in-house, the company said, noting plans to hire workers in Wichita for insourcing and to meet rising production at Boeing and Airbus. POLITICAL AND PRODUCTION RISKS Shifting work offshore risks drawing a critical tweet from President Donald Trump, whose "America First" policy is intended in part to bring factory jobs back to the United States. It is also unusual, and risky, in an industry that relies on long-term agreements to ensure millions of complex, highly engineered parts reach aircraft factories on time. Many aerospace manufacturers have moved work to low-cost countries such as China, Mexico and Morocco. But Spirit's shifts to new suppliers could disrupt production at Boeing, Airbus and others if parts are late or defective, analysts and consultants said. The changes come as Boeing and Airbus are ramping up production and slashing costs to battle on price for orders, as airlines slow their purchases of new aircraft. Spirit Chief Executive Officer Tom Gentile discussed some details of supplier actions at a Feb. 9 investor conference. But the Feb. 13 letter goes further, saying Spirit "has launched a company-wide Strategic Sourcing Initiative" and asking suppliers to send "decision-makers" to Wichita the week of Feb. 27 "or have them available remotely" so Spirit can "have each proposal ready for a contract by the end of the day." "Suppliers shall be awarded contracts based on results from an intense bid and contract award process," Spirit wrote in the letter, signed by Wendy Crossman, Spirit's director of supply chain management contractors. MASSIVE FACTORY Since Spirit spun off from Boeing in 2005, it has gone from being a Boeing factory to making parts for Airbus, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd <7011.T>, General Dynamics Corp's Gulfstream, Bombardier Inc , Textron Inc's Bell Helicopter, and Lockheed Martin Corp's Sikorsky. It has facilities in three U.S. states, plus the UK, France and Malaysia. Its massive Wichita facility produces 42 fuselages a month for Boeing's 737 program, the complete front section of the 787 Dreamliner and many other Boeing components. Spirit said about 90 percent of its supply chain spending is made in the United States, including about $1.2 billion annually to more than 500 suppliers in Kansas and surrounding states. Gentile, who took over last July, has pushed for lower costs on the two-thirds of its overall spending that is made in the supply chain. In December, Spirit warned about 85 supplier contract administrators in Wichita that their jobs were at risk of being outsourced. Spirit later kept the work in-house. In February, Gentile noted many suppliers have "very strong margins" in structural airplane pieces. "That's an opportunity for us to take advantage of that and capture some of that margin," Gentile said. The company reported an operating margin of 10.7 percent in 2016, slightly below the industry average, according to Thomson Reuters data. Its 2016 revenue totaled $6.8 billion. Spirit's drive for greater profit margins is in line with Boeing, which is trying to double its margins to mid-teen percentages by 2020. Spirit's lower prices have already prompted some current U.S. suppliers to give up work. Spirit's targets are lower "than what I gave them the last time," said the U.S. metals supplier chief executive, referring to past negotiations. "It's bankruptcy-level pricing," he said. Spirit's ability to change contracts also bars companies from investing in new machinery, because they risk losing the work before earning back their costs, said the U.S. metals supplier chief executive. The chief executive of another U.S. company that makes metal aircraft parts said Spirit's actions were unprecedented in his decades in the industry. Said the executive, "I've never seen anything like this in my career."

The Machinists union said 1,500 of its members applied for a buyout and were approved to leave the company. The engineering union at Boeing said 305 of its members were approved and are expected to leave the company in April. Machinists who accepted the buyout got one week of severance pay for each year of service up to a maximum of 26 weeks pay, plus six months of medical coverage at the same rate as when employed.

Engineering staff got the same severance pay package, but with only three months of medical coverage. Boeing declined to release any figures, so the number of nonunion job cuts is unknown. These cuts are just the beginning, with more to follow through the year. Boeing slashed almost 7,400 jobs in the state last year. Then in December, Boeing Vice Chairman Ray Conner and the new chief executive of Boeing Commercial Airplanes, Kevin McAllister, issued a joint message to employees warning that “fewer sales opportunities and tough competition” would drive further cuts in 2017. International Association of Machinists spokeswoman Connie Kelliher said Boeing has not indicated to the union what its end target is for job cuts this year. “We don’t know if this round of buyouts fulfilled what they were looking for,” said Kelliher. Last year, Boeing cut 2,100 Machinist jobs, all through attrition or voluntary buyouts, with no forced layoffs. Bill Dugovich, a spokesman for the engineering union, the Society of Professional Engineering Employees in Aerospace (SPEEA), said Boeing management last week told the union that if there are any further rounds of buyouts this year, they will be more limited, targeting very specific groups of employees. In a January memo to Boeing’s engineering staff, John Hamilton, vice president of engineering at Commercial Airplanes, said there will be two additional rounds of buyouts and layoffs in engineering later this year. Dugovich said Boeing has told union officials to expect the total number of job cuts in 2017 to be “in line with last year.” Last year, SPEEA lost about 1,200 members, with 350 of those cuts being involuntary layoffs. Boeing spokesman Paul Bergman said the February buyouts were a continuation of the process announced in December, with the company aiming to achieve the job cuts “through a combination of attrition, leaving open positions unfilled, voluntary layoff program and in some cases, involuntary layoffs.” “Every few months, there’s going to be another group going through this,” he said.

The Air Force plans to procure 84 new helicopters as part of the branch's UH-1N Replacement Program. The Huey currently protects intercontinental ballistic missiles, or ICBMs, and is also used to support military transport missions. Boeing's submission is based on Leonardo's AW139 helicopter. The Italy-based defense contractor says the MH-139 can provide over $1 billion in acquisitions and life-cycle savings over a 30-year period. "The outstanding superior technology and operational capabilities of our products, including the AW139, once again allow us to compete for significant market opportunities," Leonardo CEO Mauro Moretti said in a press release. Boeing officials went on to suggest the AW139 is already a popular purchase. "The fact that the AW139 is being built today on an active production line will speed it to meet the time-critical demand following the competition," said Judy Fedder, Boeing's director of global sales and marketing. Roughly 900 AW139s are in service for 250 governments, armed forces and private enterprises, according to Boeing.

REUTERS/Jim Young Enlarge Caption  Email More A A COPENHAGEN: Boeing is taking Denmark to court over a lack of access to documents used in the government's decision last year to buy Lockheed Martin's new F-35 Lightning II combat jets in preference to Boeing's F/A 18 Super Hornets. "Boeing has filed a lawsuit against the Ministry of Defence because the ministry has not responded to the request for access to the documents which are the foundation for the evaluation in the competition for the fighter jets," Boeing said in statement. Last year Boeing complained about the government's decision to buy 27 F-35s, saying it questioned the accuracy of data used in the decision making process which suggested its Super Hornets would be a more expensive option. Boeing subsequently said in September that it had submitted a request to the defense ministry that would require it to provide all materials related to the procurement evaluation and decision. The ministry said in a statement on Thursday that it had not given Boeing access to the documents because the U.S. firm had not told the government exactly what documents it wanted to see. The ministry said it could not comment further now that the legal action was underway.

The company employs people in four states - but the incident is believed to have involved the aircraft manufacturing plant in Everett, near Seattle, Washington. KOMO News reported that in November an employee accidentally sent a spreadsheet containing private information to his spouse, something that did not come to light until January.  A line of Boeing 787 Dreamliner jets are parked at Paine Field in Everett, Washington. Last month more than 7,000 Boeing workers in the state learned that their personal information had been accidentally divulged RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Boeing opens its first European factory in the UK with plans...

Share this article Share Boeing said the spreadsheet contained names, ID numbers and accounting codes as well as birth dates and social security numbers. Boeing employs 36,000 people across four states, including at this plant in Renton, Washington In February the company wrote a letter to 7,288 employees in Washington state, notifying them of the incident and offering free credit monitoring. Boeing also informed the state of Washington's Attorney General Bob Ferguson.  The company has since destroyed copies of the spreadsheet and said they did not believe the information had been misused. It is not clear if the employee was sacked or faced any disciplinary action.   It appears he had asked his wife for help formatting the spreadsheet and did not realize it contained sensitive information.   As well as Washington, Boeing employs significant numbers of people in South Carolina, Louisiana and at its corporate headquarters in Chicago.    Read more: komonews.com/new...

REUTERS/Jim Young COPENHAGEN Boeing is taking Denmark to court over a lack of access to documents used in the government's decision last year to buy Lockheed Martin's (LMT.N) new F-35 Lightning II combat jets in preference to Boeing's F/A 18 Super Hornets. "Boeing has filed a lawsuit against the Ministry of Defence because the ministry has not responded to the request for access to the documents which are the foundation for the evaluation in the competition for the fighter jets," Boeing said in statement. Last year Boeing complained about the government's decision to buy 27 F-35s, saying it questioned the accuracy of data used in the decision making process which suggested its Super Hornets would be a more expensive option. Boeing subsequently said in September that it had submitted a request to the defense ministry that would require it to provide all materials related to the procurement evaluation and decision. The ministry said in a statement on Thursday that it had not given Boeing access to the documents because the U.S. firm had not told the government exactly what documents it wanted to see. The ministry said it could not comment further now that the legal action was underway.

Canadian bacteria-like fossils called oldest evidence of life Microfossils up to almost 4.3 billion years old found in Canada of microbes are similar to the bacteria that thrive today around sea floor hydrothermal vents and may represent the oldest-known evidence of life on Earth, scientists said on Wednesday. The fossils from the Hudson Bay shoreline in northern Quebec near the Nastapoka Islands lend credence to the hypothesis that hydrothermal vents spewing hot water may have been the cradle of life on Earth relatively soon after the planet formed, the researchers said. Snooze news: elephants may sleep less than any other mammal There's an old saying that elephants never forget. You also can say they almost never sleep. Scientists on Wednesday said a first-of-its-kind study tracking the sleep behavior of wild elephants found the world's largest land mammal sleeps two hours per day on average, and some days not at all, and does so mostly standing up. NASA inks deal with Boeing for extra rides for astronauts NASA will pay Boeing Co up to $373.5 million for rides to fly up to five astronauts to the International Space Station aboard Russian Soyuz capsules, the U.S. space agency said on Tuesday. The extra rides will allow the National Aeronautics and Space Administration to add a fourth U.S. astronaut to the six-member station crew more than a year ahead of schedule. Russia in April is reducing its crew from three to two. Hundreds of North American bee species face extinction: study More than 700 of the 4,000 native bee species in North America and Hawaii are believed to be inching toward extinction due to increased pesticide use leading to habitat loss, a scientific study showed on Wednesday. The Center for Biological Diversity's report concluded that of the 1,437 native bee species for which there was sufficient data to evaluate, about 749 of them were declining. Some 347 of the species, which play a vital role in plant pollination, are imperiled and at risk of extinction, the study found. Laser technique sheds light on pivotal Chinese feathered dinosaur A technique using high-powered lasers to reveal hidden soft tissue alongside bones in fossils is giving scientists insight into one of the major evolutionary transitions in the history of life: small feathered dinosaurs taking flight as birds. Scientists said on Tuesday they used the method on fossils of the chicken-sized, feathered, bird-like dinosaur Anchiornis that lived in China about 160 million years ago, finding it possessed drumstick-shaped legs, arms similar to the wings of some modern gliding and soaring birds, and a long, slender tail. New minerals back idea of man-made epoch for Earth: study Scientists have identified more than 200 minerals created as side-effects of human industries in a sign that mankind's imprint on the Earth is so deep that it marks a new geological epoch, a study said on Wednesday. Rare chemical combinations such as those found in mines, ore dumps or smelters have triggered the formation of new minerals, it said. One previously unknown mineral crystal, for instance, was found on a wooden pit prop deep in a nickel mine in Russia.

The news comes in the wake of delays to NASA’s Commercial Crew Program, an initiative where two American companies — SpaceX and Boeing — are being paid to create spacecraft that can ferry astronauts to the ISS. Those flights were originally supposed to happen this year, but are now estimated to take place no earlier than 2019. The additional seats are being worked into an existing contract with Boeing, which helps operate the ISS. The agreement extension covers two seats on Soyuz flights this year and next year, and includes options for seats on three Soyuz flights in 2019. Boeing acquired theses seats from Russian aerospace company RSC Energia, and has been trying to sell them to NASA since January. The total cost of all five seats is $373.5 million, or $74.7 million per seat — a touch short of the $81.7 million NASA has been paying Roscosmos. Flights with SpaceX and Boeing should be cheaper than Russia — when they happen The US hasn’t had the capability to send its own astronauts to space (or bring them back) since the Space Shuttle program was discontinued in 2011. Private US spaceflight companies were growing at a rapid pace then, so NASA decided to fund these companies so they could become a sort of space taxi service for American astronauts. The Commercial Crew Program was intended to give NASA a cheaper alternative to Russia, but the program has been hampered by delays and cost issues. The space agency is also planning to fly astronauts on its own Orion spacecraft and the Space Launch System (SLS) maybe as early as 2019, but that program has also been delayed. In 2015, NASA spent $490 million on six more Soyuz seats as a hedge against the possibility that the SpaceX and Boeing spacecraft wouldn’t be ready in time. Seats on the Soyuz are typically sorted out three years in advance when dealing directly with Roscosmos. (NASA was able to book the two new seats with less time since they had already been accounted for when they were bought by RSC Energia.) It was a prescient move because Boeing delayed — twice — the first crewed flight of its spacecraft, Starliner, in 2016. And SpaceX followed suit at the end of the year, saying in December that the human-rated version of its Dragon spacecraft wouldn’t fly with a crew until at least 2018. This is not the first time NASA has extended the contract with Russia Two weeks ago, the Government Accountability Office — a federal agency that performs audits for Congress — released a report that estimated SpaceX and Boeing won’t be ready to fly humans to space until 2019. The GAO cited concerns about a particular defect in SpaceX’s engine turbines, as well as Boeing’s reliance on Russian rocket engines as some of the reasons. NASA addressed the GAO report implicitly in the press release about the contract extension with Russia. “NASA’s Commercial crew transportation providers Boeing and SpaceX have made significant progress toward returning crew launches to the US, but external review groups have recommended an option to protect for delays or problems in certification,” the agency wrote. The contract extension with Russia was actually announced a week ago, and it was first spotted by SpaceNews, which points out the curious nature of how NASA quietly published the news. The agency is currently in a transitional phase as it waits for President Donald Trump to name a new NASA administrator. NASA is waiting for Trump to name a new administrator Robert Lightfoot, who is serving as acting administrator, recently sent a memo to NASA employees explaining his interest in accelerating NASA’s plans for human spaceflight. He asked for NASA and Lockheed Martin, which makes Orion and SLS, to evaluate whether it would be possible to put a crew on the first flight of that spaceship / rocket combination in 2018 instead of 2021. It’s a bold idea for a space agency that is known for caution, but it aligns with what we know the Trump administration wants out of NASA: an increased emphasis on human spaceflight and space exploration in general. “President Trump said in his inaugural address that we will ‘unlock the mysteries of space,’” Lightfoot wrote. “The SLS and Orion missions, coupled with those promised from record levels of private investment in space, will help put NASA and America in a position to unlock those mysteries and to ensure this nation’s world preeminence in exploring the cosmos.” Next Up In Science Jeff Bezos shows off Blue Origin’s new rocket engine, fully assembled for the first time Pollution kills 1.7 million children every year, WHO reports Watch origami fold with no one touching it This fat-loss breathalyzer is now available for $699 Wasp queens pass down their personalities to worker wasps Can headphones train you to focus better?

REUTERS/Jim Young Enlarge Caption  Email More A A COPENHAGEN: Boeing is taking Denmark to court over a lack of access to documents used in the government's decision last year to buy Lockheed Martin's new F-35 Lightning II combat jets in preference to Boeing's F/A 18 Super Hornets. "Boeing has filed a lawsuit against the Ministry of Defence because the ministry has not responded to the request for access to the documents which are the foundation for the evaluation in the competition for the fighter jets," Boeing said in statement. Last year Boeing complained about the government's decision to buy 27 F-35s, saying it questioned the accuracy of data used in the decision making process which suggested its Super Hornets would be a more expensive option. Boeing subsequently said in September that it had submitted a request to the defense ministry that would require it to provide all materials related to the procurement evaluation and decision. The ministry said in a statement on Thursday that it had not given Boeing access to the documents because the U.S. firm had not told the government exactly what documents it wanted to see. The ministry said it could not comment further now that the legal action was underway.

BUSINESS Virgin Galactic's LauncherOne small satellite service becomes separate company Virgin Orbit Christina House / Christina House Virgin Orbit President Dan Hart, right, and Galactic Ventures Chief Executive George Whitesides, left, are photographed at Virgin Orbit's Long Beach facility. (Christina House / For The Times) Virgin Orbit President Dan Hart, right, and Galactic Ventures Chief Executive George Whitesides, left, are photographed at Virgin Orbit's Long Beach facility. (Christina House / For The Times) (Christina House / Christina House) Samantha MasunagaContact Reporter Virgin Galactic’s small satellite launch division is now its own company. Known as Virgin Orbit, the Long Beach company will be focused on developing LauncherOne, a satellite-launching rocket that will be dropped from the wing of a Boeing 747. Virgin Orbit will be led by former Boeing Co. executive Dan Hart, who previously served as Boeing’s vice president of government satellite systems. “I’ve been through a lot of different space programs … and the most fun I have is when you’re driving with a team of enormous talent towards a milestone that’s going to have an impact on the world,” Hart said. “The team here is on exactly that kind of pursuit.” Virgin Galactic is building a ship that will take paying tourists on a suborbital ride to space. Virgin Orbit’s operations are geared specifically toward the small satellite market. New technology has driven down the price of building and launching a satellite, and a number of companies, including SpaceX in Hawthorne and OneWeb in Arlington, Va., have proposed constellations of small satellites to provide broadband and communication capabilities across the globe. “You see both in plans and in reality these truly spectacular numbers of satellites, far exceeding what’s been launched in the past,” said George Whitesides, chief executive of Virgin Group’s commercial space portfolio Galactic Ventures, which includes Virgin Orbit, Virgin Galactic and the Spaceship Co. “The size of the market and the ability for this team to really focus on that is something that encouraged us to say, ‘Now’s the time to have this dedicated entity.’” Virgin Orbit is aiming for the first test flight of LauncherOne by the end of this year.  Caption 90 seconds: 4 stories you can't miss Can Trump's White House investigate itself?

Spar assembly line operators Jeff Armstrong and Larry Freeman monitor the robotic drilling machines at Boeing’s Renton plant. (GeekWire Photo / Alan Boyle) In an age where companies and governments are protecting themselves against cyberattacks on a global scale, mundane security risks are easy to overlook. Boeing found that out the hard way after the private information of 36,000 Boeing employees was put at risk when an employee emailed the data to his spouse to ask for help formatting a document. According to a letter the company sent to Washington State Attorney General Bob Ferguson, the employee wasn’t aware that the Microsoft Excel file he was having trouble with had social security numbers and dates of birth for 36,000 of his coworkers, including 7,288 Washington state residents. That information was contained in hidden columns, while the portion of the sheet he was able to see contained the employees’ names, place of birth, employee IDs and accounting department codes. He emailed the document to his spouse, who is not a Boeing employee, in November of last year. The company realized what had happened more than six weeks later and conducted “a forensic examination of both the Boeing employee’s computer and the spouse’s computer to confirm that any copies of the spreadsheet have been deleted,” the letter said. While Boeing says it is confident the information wasn’t spread beyond those two devices, it is offering two years of free credit monitoring for all affected employees. The company said it will also require additional training on handling personal data. Read Boeing’s letter to the Attorney General, as well as the notice Boeing sent to it employees, below: Clare McGrane is a GeekWire reporter who covers life sciences, biotechnology and general assignment technology stories, in addition to producing the GeekWire radio show and podcast.

Boeing, which has been weighing options of opening an office either in Kenya or Ethiopia to gain a foothold in the eastern Africa market, will also open another office in Johannesburg, South Africa. Chamsou Andjorin, the Boeing director of government affairs and market development, will head the Nairobi office while the Johannesburg office will be headed by Joao Miguel Santos, Boeing's managing director for sub-Saharan Africa, a South African media report said. "Africa is not new territory for Boeing. Since the introduction of the jet airplane, Boeing aircraft have formed the backbone of the continent's commercial fleet and Boeing continues to be one of the largest US-based companies doing business on the continent," Mr Santos was quoted by South African media confirming the development. "The aerospace industry needs to start paying closer attention to Africa, because this continent is clearly on the move economically and all the trends are pointing in the right direction for the expansion of the sector. Our job is to be ahead in understanding these emerging trends and opportunities." The US giant, which is the supplier of Kenya Airways and Ethiopian Airlines' fleet of Dreamliners and other Boeing planes, had until now had a presence only in North Africa. Kenya and Ethiopia have recently been racing to attract foreign direct investments into their economies with creation of special economic zones and promises of lower costs of doing business including cheap electricity. "Talent and comparative advantage will guide us in our choice of location in the region," said Boeing's senior vice president Marc Allen on the sidelines of an American business forum in Nairobi in 2015. Mr Allen said the firm's areas of interest include research, engineering and analytics. The world's largest aerospace company projects Africa would be in need of 1,150 new airplanes over the next 20 years as the most recent Current Market Outlook report predicted that air traffic to and from the continent is expected to grow by about 6.1 per cent annually.

Indian carriers are rapidly expanding to meet demand in the world’s fastest-growing aviation market, with most of the growth involving flights into and out of the country’s biggest cities. “We have presented it to both the airlines what the airplane looks like, and it’s in a very preliminary stage,” Dinesh Keskar, senior vice president, Asia Pacific and India sales, Boeing Commercial Airplanes, told Reuters. “If you are flying to the metros this (737 MAX-10) will be a perfect airplane, because runways are long, demand is there, frequency is already there.” Airplane makers typically line up orders before deciding whether to formally undertake building a new aircraft. SpiceJet and Jet Airways have the option to substitute some of their existing orders of MAX planes with the MAX-10, Keskar said. In January, budget airline SpiceJet agreed to buy 100 new 737 MAXs aircraft with an option for 50 more, while Jet Airways had 75 orders for the 737 MAX through January 2017. SpiceJet and Jet Airways did not respond to requests for comment. Boeing is creating up to five versions of MAX, which will replace the current 737 “NG” introduced in 1997 and offer greater fuel efficiency. The company has been looking at the feasibility of the 737 MAX-10 – the biggest aircraft in the MAX family – to take on rival Airbus <AIR.PA>, which has had strong sales of its A321neo, its largest single-aisle aircraft. The first MAX model in production, the MAX-8, is on track to reach customers by mid-year. The A321neo competes with Boeing’s MAX-9, which carries a list price of $116.6 million and seats as many as 220 passengers. The A321neo seats as many as 236 and has a list price of $127 million. Keskar said the incremental cost to operate the MAX-10 is going to be very little and airlines may face slightly higher costs on fuel, food and an extra cabin attendant. “But your potential gain in the revenue will be phenomenal,” he said.

Photo: Reuters mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 11:00 PM, March 3, 2017 Updated: 11:10 PM, March 3, 2017 Boeing Co <BA.N> has approached India's SpiceJet Ltd <SPJT.BO> and Jet Airways Ltd <JET.NS> as it gauges airlines' interest in its 737 MAX-10 aircraft, the stretched version of the yet-to-be-delivered 737 MAX narrow-body jetliner, a senior executive said. Indian carriers are rapidly expanding to meet demand in the world's fastest-growing aviation market, with most of the growth involving flights into and out of the country's biggest cities. "We have presented it to both the airlines what the airplane looks like, and it's in a very preliminary stage," Dinesh Keskar, senior vice president, Asia Pacific and India sales, Boeing Commercial Airplanes, told Reuters. "If you are flying to the metros this (737 MAX-10) will be a perfect airplane, because runways are long, demand is there, frequency is already there." Airplane makers typically line up orders before deciding whether to formally undertake building a new aircraft. SpiceJet and Jet Airways have the option to substitute some of their existing orders of MAX planes with the MAX-10, Keskar said. In January, budget airline SpiceJet agreed to buy 100 new 737 MAXs aircraft with an option for 50 more, while Jet Airways had 75 orders for the 737 MAX through January 2017. SpiceJet and Jet Airways did not respond to requests for comment. Boeing is creating up to five versions of MAX, which will replace the current 737 "NG" introduced in 1997 and offer greater fuel efficiency. The company has been looking at the feasibility of the 737 MAX-10 - the biggest aircraft in the MAX family - to take on rival Airbus <AIR.PA>, which has had strong sales of its A321neo, its largest single-aisle aircraft. The first MAX model in production, the MAX-8, is on track to reach customers by mid-year. The A321neo competes with Boeing's MAX-9, which carries a list price of $116.6 million and seats as many as 220 passengers. The A321neo seats as many as 236 and has a list price of $127 million. Keskar said the incremental cost to operate the MAX-10 is going to be very little and airlines may face slightly higher costs on fuel, food and an extra cabin attendant. "But your potential gain in the revenue will be phenomenal," he said.

The Dow 's streak of record-high closes matches a 12-day run in 1987, with Boeing and UnitedHealth among the biggest boosts for the Dow on Monday. The S&P 500 also closed at a record high. Energy gave the biggest boost to the S&P 500, with the energy index up 0.9 percent. Trump, who met with state governors at the White House, also said he is seeking what he called a "historic" increase in military spending of more than 9 percent, while he said his administration would be "moving quickly" on regulatory reforms. The comments came ahead of Trump's first address to a joint session of Congress Tuesday evening. Investors are looking for more specifics on Trump's plans, given the hefty gains in the market since the Nov. 8 election. "Things are moving along in terms of the Trump agenda, but we'll get a clearer picture after tomorrow night so that might precipitate some buying or selling," said Bucky Hellwig, senior vice president at BB&T Wealth Management in Birmingham, Alabama. Hellwig and others said there's potentially more upside than dow nside from the address, given how the market has reacted in recent weeks. Shares of U.S. defense companies - Boeing, Raytheon , General Dynamics and Lockheed Martin - rose after Trump said he would seek to boost Pentagon spending by $54 billion in his first budget proposal. Boeing was up 1.1 percent while UnitedHealth was up 1.4 percent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 15.68 points, or 0.08 percent, to close at 20,837.44, the S&P 500 gained 2.39 points, or 0.10 percent, to 2,369.73 and the Nasdaq Composite added 16.59 points, or 0.28 percent, to 5,861.90. In its 1987 12-day streak of record-high closes, the Dow rose 9.2 percent compared with just a 3.9 percent gain in the recent record run. While the S&P 500 is up 10.8 percent since the Nov. 8 election, the pace of the rally has slowed this year. Trump's promise a few weeks ago of a "phenomenal" tax announcement helped rekindle the post-election rally, driving the main U.S. markets to record highs. Time Warner ended up 0.9 percent after news that the head of the U.S. Federal Communications Commission does not expect to review AT&T Inc's planned $85.4 billion acquisition of Time Warner. AT&T slipped 1.3 percent. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.55-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.87-to-1 ratio favored advancers. The S&P 500 posted 63 new 52-week highs and one new low; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 143 new highs and 45 new lows.

U.S. officials raided the Illinois-based offices of large machinery manufacturer Caterpillar on Thursday, Reuters reported. (“Machinery” photo via Pexels). Caterpillar shares fall after Fed raid Federal officials raided three Illinois-based facilities owned by the heavy machinery manufacturer Caterpillar Inc. on Thursday, Reuters reported. It still isn’t clear why officials conducted the searches, but Caterpillar suggested they may be tied to an Internal Revenue Service investigation on profits earned by a Swiss subsidiary. U.S. officials confirmed they had searched the facilities, but declined to provide a reason for the searches. Caterpillar shares dropped sharply after the news was made public. Boeing’s massive layoffs Bloomberg reported plane manufacturer Boeing Inc. announced it is eliminating at least 1,800 jobs in the Seattle area amid pressure to cut costs in the extremely competitive commercial-aircraft market. More than 1,500 mechanics have agreed to voluntary layoffs, in addition to another 305 engineers and technical workers, the wire service reported. Boeing first announced the buyouts to employees in December. There also are plans to cut commercial-airplane jobs by leaving open positions unfilled and involuntary layoffs, a company spokesperson told Bloomberg. Snapchat soars 44 percent on Day One Shares of Snap, the parent company of the disappearing-photo app Snapchat, closed up 44 percent on Thursday, the day of its market debut. The successful initial public offering could encourage other tech companies to go public, reported The New York Times. Snap shares opened on the New York Stock Exchange at $24, up from the initial public offering price of $17 a share, and closed at $24.48. That’s roughly three times the market value of Twitter. Although the Snapchat app still isn’t making money, investors are attracted to the service’s average 158 users per day. U.S. jobless claims at 44-year low The U.S. labor market continues to strengthen as data showing the number of American filing for unemployment benefits fell to near a 44-year low last week, Reuters reported. That’s prompted speculation that the stronger labor market and rising inflation will prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates this month. Initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 19,000 to a seasonally adjusted 223,000 for the week ended Feb. 25, the lowest level since March 1973, the Labor Department said on Thursday.       Related Posts Must-Read Money Stories for Tuesday, Feb. 28 Must-Read Money Stories for Wednesday, March 1 Must-Read Money Stories for Thursday, March 2 Must-Read Money Stories Search Our Site Search for: Subscribe to Our Podcast     Latest News LGBT-Owned Business: Stats and Facts Share this!LGBT-owned businesses can be a valuable topic for business March 6, 2017 Must-Read Money Stories for Monday, March 6 Share this!Another re-org for Deutsche Bank The supervisory board of Deutsche March 6, 2017 Donald W.

With Honeywell and Raytheon recently hitting record highs and Boeing's leadership sending the Dow Jones industrial average past the 21,000 mark Wednesday, the defense sector has been on a tear, up 17 percent since November's election. The major catalyst for the sector in the past few months had been Trump's proposed commitment to increase defense spending, a point he reiterated in his speech to Congress on Tuesday night. Trump's call to move ahead with "one of the largest increases in national defense spending in American history" is exactly what leads Mark Tepper, founder of Strategic Wealth Partners, to bank on more room to run for defense stocks, even from a fundamental standpoint. "These stocks have finally grown into what was previously extended valuations," Tepper said Thursday on CNBC's "Power Lunch." "While being far from cheap, rapid earnings growth in the future has really brought down those forward multiples to an acceptable level." However, not everyone believes in another rally for defense stocks, including Dennis Davitt, partner at Harvest Volatility Management. "There could be potential growth, there could be great volatility [and] it could sell off," he said Thursday on "Power Lunch." "That's a place where you want to either buy [bearish options] to protect your position, or sell out of your position." This year alone, stocks like Boeing and Honeywell are up as much as 17 percent and 9 percent, respectively. But even among defense stocks that haven't hit record highs, names like Northrop Grumman are up more than 25 percent just over the past year.

Short term: Prices are moving. Intermediate term: Prices are trending. Note: this chart shows extraordinary price action to the upside. By the way, prices are vulnerable to a correction towards 166.86. The projected upper bound is: 188.47. The projected lower bound is: 178.65. The projected closing price is: 183.56. Candlesticks A black body occurred (because prices closed lower than they opened). During the past 10 bars, there have been 8 white candles and 2 black candles for a net of 6 white candles. During the past 50 bars, there have been 27 white candles and 21 black candles for a net of 6 white candles. Momentum Indicators Momentum is a general term used to describe the speed at which prices move over a given time period. Generally, changes in momentum tend to lead to changes in prices. This expert shows the current values of four popular momentum indicators. Stochastic Oscillator One method of interpreting the Stochastic Oscillator is looking for overbought areas (above 80) and oversold areas (below 20). The Stochastic Oscillator is 80.1125. This is an overbought reading. However, a signal is not generated until the Oscillator crosses below 80 The last signal was a buy 17 period(s) ago. Relative Strength Index (RSI) The RSI shows overbought (above 70) and oversold (below 30) areas. The current value of the RSI is 80.13. This is where it usually tops. The RSI usually forms tops and bottoms before the underlying security. A buy or sell signal is generated when the RSI moves out of an overbought/oversold area. The last signal was a sell 22 period(s) ago. Commodity Channel Index (CCI) The CCI shows overbought (above 100) and oversold (below -100) areas. The current value of the CCI is 126.This is an overbought reading. However, a signal isn’t generated until the indicator crosses below 100. The last signal was a sell 22 period(s) ago. MACD The Moving Average Convergence/Divergence indicator (MACD) gives signals when it crosses its 9 period signal line. The last signal was a buy 11 period(s) ago. Rex Takasugi – TD Profile BOEING CO closed down -0.920 at 182.990. Volume was 11% above average (neutral) and Bollinger Bands were 120% wider than normal.

Summary BOEING CO is currently 28.1% above its 200-period moving average and is in an upward trend. Volatility is extremely low when compared to the average volatility over the last 10 periods.

Boeing's machinists union, the touch labor that builds airplanes near Seattle, said about 1,575 workers had taken voluntary layoffs by the deadline in February. Boeing's white-collar union said Boeing accepted 305 members for voluntary layoffs in January. Last year, Boeing cut about 1,200 white-collar union jobs - 850 through voluntary layoffs and 350 through involuntary reductions, said Bill Dugovich, spokesman for the Society of Professional Engineering Employees in Aerospace. "Boeing has told us to expect about the same number of total layoffs in 2017 as 2016," he said. The job reductions had been announced last year and workers had until Feb. 1 to apply. "These are all voluntary, where people planned to retire or had other plans," said Connie Kelliher, a spokeswoman for the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers District 751. Boeing said it did not have a specific target number for its job reductions at the commercial airplane unit but was sticking with the broad plan of reducing jobs it outlined in December. "We are reducing costs and aligning employment levels to business and market requirements," spokesman Paul Bergman said. "Employment reductions will come through a combination of attrition, leaving open positions unfilled, voluntary layoff program and in some cases, involuntary layoffs." Boeing offered the buyouts to workers last year as part of an 8 percent workforce reduction at its commercial airplane business. The unit had about 74,600 workers at the end of February. Boeing said in December it would cut an as-yet-undetermined number of jobs in 2017. No machinists have had involuntary layoffs for several years, Kelliher said. Boeing's shares closed down 0.5 percent at $182.99 on the New York Stock Exchange.

RENTON — The Boeing Co.’s newest jetliner — the 737 MAX 9 — is scheduled to roll out of the company’s Renton plant Tuesday. The airplane’s unveiling puts it on pace for first flight in April. It is expected to enter service with airlines in 2018. The MAX 9 is a nearly 7-foot stretch of the MAX 8, which first flew in January 2016. All 737 MAX versions are powered with new CFM International Leap-1B engines. Boeing is expected to deliver the first MAX 8 to launch customer Norwegian in April or May. Norwegian has ordered 108 737 MAX 8s, which has garnered the vast majority of the 3,600 737 MAX orders so far. Customers have placed about 220 orders for the MAX 9. So far, Airbus’ competing A321neo has proven far more popular in the marketplace. Boeing is reportedly talking with airlines about stretching the MAX 9 even more into a MAX 10.

(Photo: Susan Walsh / AP) 66 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 4 COMMENTEMAILMORE Boeing Co. is shrinking its Seattle-area workforce by at least 1,800 jobs this year as the company streamlines operations in a brutally competitive commercial-aircraft market. The planemaker approved voluntary layoffs for 1,500 mechanics, according to a person familiar with the situation who asked not to be named because it hasn’t been made public. Another 305 engineers and technical workers are leaving voluntarily, Bill Dugovich, a spokesman for their union, said Thursday. Boeing told employees in December that it would seek buyouts as part of an effort to cut costs and match employment to market requirements, company spokesman Paul Bergman said by email. Boeing also plans to cull commercial-airplane jobs by leaving open positions unfilled and through involuntary layoffs, he said. He declined to say how many buyouts have been approved. The Chicago-based manufacturer has been winnowing employment in the Puget Sound area, its largest industrial base, over the past year as sales slowed for the jetliners, which accounted for 69 percent of total revenue last year. Boeing has trimmed its Washington state workforce by 9.2 percent to 71,036 since the start of last year even as Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg has emerged in meetings with President Donald Trump as an advocate for U.S. manufacturing. Those earlier cuts included about 1,000 members of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers and 850 members of the Society of Professional Engineering Employees in America who applied for voluntary layoffs. Another 350 SPEEA members lost their jobs involuntarily, Dugovich said. Boeing officials last week told the engineering union to “expect a similar reduction in workforce in our units as we experienced last year,” he said.

The IAM’s more than 600,000 members are highly-skilled workers who manufacture iconic products like Boeing airplanes and Harley-Davidson motorcycles. “We believe that the time is long overdue for policy makers to stand up to corporations who are all too willing to move jobs to Mexico, China or anywhere else in the world to take advantage of workers who do not enjoy fundamental human rights—like the right to form a union,” Martinez wrote to President Trump. Martinez reiterated the IAM’s stance on opposing trade policies that have cost millions of U.S. and Canadian jobs, especially failed trade agreements like NAFTA and the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership. But a manufacturing resurgence will take more than undoing years of bad trade policy, said Martinez. “Unfortunately, IAM members have frequently been the victims of corporations sending our jobs to other countries,” said Martinez. Offshoring manufacturing—especially in the aerospace and defense industries—sacrifices critical research and development, said Martinez. Boeing plans to open a new 737 finishing center in China — “work that should be performed here at home,” said Martinez. A significant portion of work on the 737 and 787 Dreamliner is already done overseas. “Boeing’s willingness to turn its back on U.S. workers who have made the company so successful represents the business model that the President has so heavily criticized,” Martinez said before the President visited Boeing’s South Carolina manufacturing facility.

REUTERS/Jim Young/Files By Alwyn Scott | SEATTLE SEATTLE Boeing Co (BA.N) has accepted 1,880 voluntary layoffs from its union machinists and engineers in the Seattle area, the unions said on Thursday, part of the jet maker's drive to cut costs through job reductions and other measures. Boeing's machinists union, the touch labor that builds airplanes near Seattle, said about 1,575 workers had taken voluntary layoffs by the deadline in February. Boeing's white-collar union said Boeing accepted 305 members for voluntary layoffs in January. Last year, Boeing cut about 1,200 white-collar union jobs - 850 through voluntary layoffs and 350 through involuntary reductions, said Bill Dugovich, spokesman for the Society of Professional Engineering Employees in Aerospace. "Boeing has told us to expect about the same number of total layoffs in 2017 as 2016," he said. The job reductions had been announced last year and workers had until Feb. 1 to apply. "These are all voluntary, where people planned to retire or had other plans," said Connie Kelliher, a spokeswoman for the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers District 751. COST-CUTTING DRIVE Boeing said it did not have a specific target number for its job reductions at the commercial airplane unit but was sticking with the broad plan of reducing jobs it outlined in December. "We are reducing costs and aligning employment levels to business and market requirements," spokesman Paul Bergman said. "Employment reductions will come through a combination of attrition, leaving open positions unfilled, voluntary layoff program and in some cases, involuntary layoffs." Boeing offered the buyouts to workers last year as part of an 8 percent workforce reduction at its commercial airplane business. The unit had about 74,600 workers at the end of February. Boeing said in December it would cut an as-yet-undetermined number of jobs in 2017. No machinists have had involuntary layoffs for several years, Kelliher said. Boeing's shares closed down 0.5 percent at $182.99 on the New York Stock Exchange.

Boeing could yet ask the members of additional unions and nonunionized workers to depart voluntarily. Workers at Boeing’s Charleston, S.C., facilities last month voted against joining a union.

Virgin Galactic CEO George Whitesides will hold the same role in the spin-off, called Virgin Orbit, with day-to-day operations now in the hands of Dan Hart, a veteran Boeing executive hired away to become Orbit's president. "It's been clear to me that there's been something changing, and I've really admired a lot of the bold moves that have gone on in the industry over the last five to 10 years, where people are doing commercially what was once only done with large, large government-funded programs," Hart said in an interview with Space.com. [Virgin Galactic's LauncherOne in Pictures] An artist's depiction of a Virgin Orbit LauncherOne rocket being air-launched from its Cosmic Girl mothership. Virgin Orbit is a spinoff company from the space tourism company Virgin Galactic. Credit: Virgin Galactic "My favorite times in my career have always been to driving teams to aggressive goals and achieving those," Hart said. "I just see this team as tremendously capable. It's kind of an all-star team, driving toward an objective and doing really well against that with a greater purpose. "I've had a great journey across Boeing through ELVs [expendable launch vehicles] and the Delta program, missile defense systems, satellites big and small — so I've really enjoyed that. I just see this as a logical next step in my journey," Hart said. The LauncherOne program, based in Long Beach, California, intends to serve the burgeoning small-satellite industry by offering low-cost, quick-turnaround launch services to orbit. With a target price of below $10 million per flight, the air-launched LauncherOne will be able to carry 440 lbs. (200 kilograms) into standard sun-synchronous orbits, or more than 880 lbs. (400 kg) to low Earth orbit. The debut flight is targeted to launch before the end of 2017. [Flashback: Virgin Galactic Unveils LauncherOne (Video)] An artist's illustration of a Virgin Orbit LauncherOne rocket carrying a small satellite into orbit. Credit: Virgin Galactic Ultimately, Virgin Orbit should be capable of manufacturing "a couple of dozen or more launch vehicles per year," Whitesides said. "When we got started a few years ago, we were at a lower number," he added. "With the investments we've made and this big manufacturing facility we have here [in Long Beach], we have the capacity to scale." Over the next five years, thousands of small satellites are expected to need rides into orbit, with big global networks in development by OneWeb, Planet, SpaceX and other firms in the United States and abroad looking to provide global high-speed internet and communications, imagery and other services. "If you look at market projections, they are looking at literally thousands of satellites to be launched over the next five years," Whitesides said. "Many of those were announced over the past couple of years. "These are all really encouraging trends — we think mostly due to Richard Branson having a good nose for what's next that LauncherOne will be coming to market at the right time," he added.

(Photo: Courtesy) Aircraft manufacturer Boeing has announced the opening of a new office in Nairobi. The move, the Chicago-based firm said in a statement on Thursday, marks a significant milestone in its global expansion plan. It comes hot on the heels of the recent granting of category-one status to Jomo Kenyatta International Airport (JKIA). The firm’s sub-Saharan Africa Managing Director Miguel Santos said establishing a firm presence on the continent for Boeing was a no-brainer. “The aerospace industry needs to start paying closer attention to Africa because this continent is clearly on the move economically and all the trends are pointing in the right direction for the expansion of the sector. Our job is to be ahead in understanding these emerging trends and opportunities,” said Santos.

(Graphic: Business Wire) Full Size Small Preview Thumbnail Full Size Small Preview Thumbnail March 02, 2017 11:43 AM Eastern Standard Time LONDON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Technavio has announced the top five leading vendors in their recent global hybrid aircraft market report. This market research report also lists four other prominent vendors that are expected to impact the market during the forecast period. Competitive vendor landscape According to the research analysis, the market for global hybrid aircraft market is a niche market with very few multinational stakeholders and negligible regional suppliers. These multinational players offer heterogeneous products and services, including customized products. As the market is highly capital intensive and completely based on technological advancements, cost, quality, and reliability, the number of vendors are limited. Suppliers in the Americas and EMEA have been involved in extensive research for over decades and have dominated the market with their technical expertise. “The existing key vendors in the market should identify and respond to the evolving trends of geopolitical situations to ensure their long-term survival in the market. These players can offer optimum and integrated solutions in response to environmental protection activities and ensure their large-scale utility. Also, providing unmanned hybrid aircraft that can take the workload off pilots and airships can take over missions with high levels of accuracy and persistence,” says Avimanyu Basu, lead aerospace research analyst from Technavio.

Technavio aerospace and defense market research analysts identify the following key vendors: Aeros Aeros manufactures products for both military and commercial applications. Aeros in global hybrid aircraft market, offers Aeroscraft, which was developed mainly for cargo transport. Aeroscraft has also found its large-scale application in delivering supplies for disaster relief to small-scale applications like picking fresh fruits and vegetables in the fields of California’s Central Valley for an overnight delivery to New York City's restaurants. Airbus In the hybrid aircraft market, one of Airbus's latest development is E-mobility, which aims at producing silent and CO₂-free flight. Airbus's E-Fan is a key element in the Airbus Group’s electric aircraft roadmap. With its technological breakthroughs and tie up with Siemens, Airbus is expected to manufacture passenger aircraft by 2030 with below 100 seats that could be propelled by hybrid propulsion systems. Boeing Boeing is focused on making airplanes that are sustainable in the long run and are more environmentally friendly. They mainly involve electric planes or aircraft using biofuels as an energy source. Boeing aims to reduce fuel burn, nitrous oxide emissions, greenhouse gases, noise, and field length. It also aims at making Canada its hub for aviation biofuels. Hybrid Air Vehicles (HAV) HAV focuses on creating a new mode of air transport that will offer major improvements in operating cost, safety, environmental impact, and operational flexibility. HAV combines LTA technology with helicopters and airplanes. HAV's hybrid airships use aerodynamics and LTA technology to generate lift and potentially allow the vehicle to hover for several weeks. Lockheed Martin Lockheed Martin engages in the production, supply, and R&D of advanced technology systems, products, and services to global defense and aerospace industries. Lockheed Martin's hybrid airship aims to provide support to a wide range of activities in areas with little or no infrastructure. The company clearly indicates its plans to employ aviation solutions to access remote locations. It also directs its efforts to address the challenge of environmental sustainability through its hybrid designs.

(Virgin Galactic) The celebrity space tourists that Richard Branson’s Virgin Galactic plans to shoot into space in the coming years may get most of the attention. But over the past couple of years he’s been increasingly focused on another space venture — one that would launch small satellites into orbit. Now Virgin Galactic officials have decided to break off the satellite launcher program and make it its own company. Called Virgin Orbit, the California-based firm is seeking to enter a market that has attracted a lot of interest in recent years as satellites, once huge and expensive, have shrunk in size and cost. The new company is to be led by Dan Hart, who spent 34 years at Boeing, where he most recently ran its satellite programs. In a statement, Branson said the new venture fits into his ethos of opening up the cosmos “by manufacturing vehicles of the future, enabling the small satellite revolution, and preparing commercial space flight for many more humans to reach space and see our home planet.” In an interview in 2015, he said he “never even thought of satellites when we thought of Virgin Galactic originally. I just thought of human space travel and a personal desire to go to space and trying to make dreams come true and so on. And then embarking on that, suddenly you realize there’s another whole aspect to this. Which is equally as exciting, really.” Virgin Orbit would join a growing number of companies developing rockets designed specifically for carrying smaller payloads into space. And it comes as a number of companies have proposed putting up large constellations of small satellites — some the size of a shoe box — that could serve a wide array of purposes, including monitoring crop yields, taking images of Earth, and providing Internet and communications. Backed by a $1 billion investment from Google and Fidelity, Elon Musk's SpaceX has announced plans to launch nearly 4,500 satellites that would beam Internet service to Earth. Boeing has a similar plan, as does a London-based company called OneWeb. SoftBank, the Tokyo-based telecommunications firm, recently announced that it is investing $1.7 billion to merge OneWeb with Intelsat. As interest grows in the new generation of satellites, many companies are sensing an opportunity. Vector, founded by a pair of entrepreneurs who were involved in the early days of SpaceX, is developing a new rocket designed for smaller payloads. As is Rocket Labs, which is based in New Zealand and California. Carissa Christensen, the chief executive of consultancy for Bryce Space and Technology (formerly known as Tauri Group Space and Technology), said there are about three dozen small satellite launch vehicles at various stages of development — likely resulting in winners and losers. “The market cannot support that many vehicles,” she said. “There’s going to be a shakeout.” Failed ventures, however, are not “indicative of a broken system,” she said. Much of the initial start-up money for these small satellite companies is coming from venture capital firms that “are generally risk tolerant. So you get starts and stops. You get companies that try and fail,” she said. Virgin Orbit may begin with an advantage. It already has several commercial and government customers signed up, said George Whitesides, who oversees Virgin’s commercial space portfolio. It operates in a 180,000-square-foot manufacturing site in Long Beach, Calif., with 200 employees. The company plans to “air launch” its two-stage rocket — meaning it would be tethered under the wing of a 747 airplane that Branson dubbed “Cosmic Girl” and that would fly to an altitude of 35,000 feet or so. The rocket would be released and then shoot off to space. Whitesides said that the company would “launch when we’re ready” but that it hopes to complete a test flight by the end of the year. Virgin Galactic also air launches its spaceplane, SpaceShipTwo, which is designed to fly two pilots and six passengers into space. The latest version of the spacecraft had its third successful test flight when it was released from its mother ship last week. It then glided back down to Earth without firing its engines. business technology the-switch true Please provide a valid email address. Sign up You’re all set!

But the solemn face of a key cog in Russia’s military machine very occasionally cracks into a mischievous grin – especially when asked about Donald Trump. "He represents big business," he says. "I hope very much economic reason will prevail." In representing big business, the US president has something in common with the 64-year-old chief executive of Rostec. Mr Chemezov – who once shared an apartment in East Germany in the 1980s with a then-young KBG agent called Vladimir Putin – is in charge of a sprawling military conglomerate of 700 companies with sales of more than 1.3 trillion roubles (Dh81.5 billion). He controls an empire that includes Russian military icons from the Kalashnikov assault rifle to the MiG fighter jet – both of which form part of his plan to increase Russian arms sales to the Arabian Gulf states in competition with the big US military contractors who have dominated the market for ­decades. He wants Rostec to be among the world’s top five biggest military companies within a decade, brushing cockpits and turrets with the likes of Lockheed Martin and Boeing. Tapping into the defence budgets of Saudi Arabia, the UAE and other regional economies will help him achieve that position by 2025. "I think it is doable for us," he says in an interview at the Idex defence show in Abu Dhabi last month, where some of the best of Russian military hardware was on display. Boosting arms exports is a key foreign policy objective of Moscow as a way of rivalling US hegemony while at the same time generating foreign revenue to support its economy that has been battered by three years of Western sanctions. As the Kremlin seeks to increase its sphere of influence in the Gulf, which is complicated by its support for the Assad regime in Syria and through its economic ties with Iran, it is also awaiting signals from the new White House administration – which continues to be harried by questions about whether Russian hackers influenced the US presidential election outcome. He dismisses that suggestion as "insane" and "crazy". "It is just an attempt by the Democrats to justify their own defeat," he says. However, a US congressional committee agreed on Wednesday to investigate allegations of Russian interference in the election. While Mr Trump’s approval ratings may be at a record low for a new president, more than 70 per cent of Russians believe he will be a competent leader according to a recent poll from VTSIOM, a state-run research body. Such popularity came across in private conversations with some Russian visitors to Idex. Born in 1952 in the southern Siberian mining town of Cheremkhovo, Mr Chemezov spent his early career in industry and later worked with Mr Putin in East Germany during the latter years of the Cold War. As one of the Russian president’s inner circle, he and his company were the target of Western sanctions following Russia’s annexation of Crimea and the outbreak of fighting in eastern Ukraine. Three years on from the introduction of sanctions, he says he hopes "business reason and economic expediency will prevail" in the new US administration. He highlights the connections of Rex Tillerson, Mr Trump’s secretary of state, who as chief executive of Exxon Mobil had close ties with Russian oil company Rosneft. He also emphasises the commercial ties with major US corporations such as Boeing, a big buyer of Russian titanium – used extensively in the Dreamliner aircraft. "We produce one third of total production of titanium in the world," he says. "If they say tomorrow, sorry we are not buying anything from you, that would mean the closure of Boeing and Airbus. I am just mentioning the majors here but of course there are many more minor companies." The message is clear: you can impose sanctions on us, but you also need us. At home he is steering a massive privatisation programme and spearheading a sales drive in the Gulf that Russia is now courting. During his visit to Abu Dhabi last month he revealed an initial plan to jointly develop a fifth generation light fighter aircraft with the UAE as well as the potential sale of Sukhoi Su-35 fighter jets. He wants to transform Rostec’s corporations, about 700 of them, many of which were loss-making Soviet-era throwbacks, into a profitable and integrated operation. The strategy is a simple one – sell what can be sold without compromising national security. "As for the assets we keep in Rostec, we are not planning to keep them forever under the auspices of the state," he says. "Whatever is possible to sell without any detriment to the state security, we will. Civil production will definitely be sold." Kalashnikov, the company’s most famous brand, is one Rostec unit that has been earmarked for greater private-­sector ownership. The company is also considering establishing a factory to make the world’s most popular assault rifle in either Saudi Arabia or the UAE. It is almost 10 years since Rostec was formed with Mr Chemezov as its head, scooping up military and industrial assets from across the country. "All of those companies were in a financial fight," he says. "Many of them were almost bankrupt. When we did our first consolidated budget our loss was 61bn roubles." Rostec has not yet reported its 2016 earnings. However, he reveals that revenues are expected to be about 1.3tn roubles with profit in the range of 70bn to 80bn roubles. The final figures are expected next month. The conglomerate is now targeting annual growth of 17 per cent, with the battlefields of the Middle East expected to play a significant part in that growth. While Western sanctions do not represent an impediment to Rostec’s sales in the region, they do in the West. The latest investigation into claims of Russian hacking during the presidential elections by the US House intelligence committee means the president will soon need to make a choice as the new relationship with the Kremlin is defined. Mr Chemezov hopes that business and not politics will mould it. "We don’t know how friendly he is as he hasn’t come to Russia yet," he says. "But he belongs to big business and he represents big business so he should be interested in the development of the relationship with Russia." scronin@thenational.ae Follow The National’s Business section on Twitter Pages: Add your comment View all comments More Economy Saudi Arabia answers questions on its transformation: the full statement The six key items on the Saudi economy’s to-do list for 2017, from expat fees to prepping Aramco UAE superyacht builder set to go even larger UAE growth could reach 4 per cent this year, says Minister of Economy MOST VIEWED Business | All Youngest Emirati female pilot flies A380 as Emirates turns attention to women – video Smaller Dubai malls feel the pinch of saturation as mega shopping centres dominate Tenders set to be issued for Abu Dhabi’s Midfield Terminal project The six key items on the Saudi economy’s to-do list for 2017, from expat fees to prepping Aramco IEA warns of looming oil supply crunch as industry leaders gather in Houston UAE superyacht builder set to go even larger Sheikh Hazza visits Midfield Terminal at Abu Dhabi Airport - in pictures Emaar chairman hopes for better year after tough 2016 for Dubai developer Saudi Arabia answers questions on its transformation: the full statement Al Futtaim targets rising retail demand with new mall in Jebel Ali area More Most Viewed Youngest Emirati female pilot flies A380 as Emirates turns attention to women – video It’s all too easy for teens to buy dokha in Dubai and Sharjah Two dead and 11 injured in Dubai crash The Debt Panel: Dubai aviation employee too stressed to eat or sleep over Dh170,000 debts Smaller Dubai malls feel the pinch of saturation as mega shopping centres dominate Exclusive: US Rapper Silento can fly out of Dubai after travel ban lifted Qasr Al Hosn to open in 2018 after renovation work Serial rapist who fled to UAE gets 20-year jail sentence in UK Tenders set to be issued for Abu Dhabi’s Midfield Terminal project More than 40 arrested in Dh1.3bn fake investment fund scam in Abu Dhabi More Most Viewed Back to the top EDITOR'S PICKS Fuel for Thought: Cheapest solar power in the world?

The Sikorsky-Boeing SB-1 Defiant, a participant on the Joint Multirole-Technology Demonstrator (JMR-TD), a precursor to FVL, is to be powered by Honeywell's T55 engine. (Sikorsky-Boeing) The FVL, a notional group of five rotorcraft classes (each referred to as a capability set), is a new start programme in fiscal year 2017 (FY 2017) and, although there is still no appropriated budget for 2017, there was funding to begin the AoA. In late 2018 or early 2019 that study will provide its initial findings to inform leadership decisions regarding a 'Milestone A' movement into technology development, after which the government would select a currently unknown number of vendors for development contracts.

Scientists are busy trying to conceive models. Courtesy Bryan Versteeg / Mars One Getting humans to Mars and back will be a marathon, not a sprint John Elbon March 2, 2017 Updated: March 3, 2017 01:07 PM Related Buzz Aldrin meets students at UAE Space Agency Inspire others, Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed tells Genes in Space winner Ambitious plans to boost UAE space programme announced Youth must shape exploration future, says UAE Space Agency chief Related Buzz Aldrin meets students at UAE Space Agency Inspire others, Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed tells Genes in Space winner Ambitious plans to boost UAE space programme announced Youth must shape exploration future, says UAE Space Agency chief Mars is at the centre of a global conversation about space exploration. Enthusiasm and excitement generated by ideas for advancing human space exploration are key to igniting our youth’s passion for space. I can see this passion is alive and well through programmes like Genes in Space. The competition challenges students to create DNA experiments to solve issues we might encounter as we explore deeper into space. The winner’s experiment will launch to the International Space Station from a site in the United States and that experiment will be conducted by astronauts on board. Recently, five teams and eight young scientists were chosen as finalists in the inaugural Genes in Space competition here in the UAE. Alia Al Mansoori won the competition, which took place at the Global Space Congress. These students from Abu Dhabi, Al Ain and Dubai were working to solve real issues we encounter in space. Alia’s winning experiment aims to study how exposure to space affects the health of live organisms at the cellular level. Students like her will one day be making groundbreaking discoveries that will enable humans to explore farther than ever before. It’s an exciting time in the space industry as we build the world’s largest most powerful rocket to take us to deep space (called the Space Launch System), test new spaceships (such as the Orion multi-purpose crew vehicle) and develop technologies for keeping humans healthy in deep space. The Space Launch System features a unique combination of mature systems and advanced technologies and is capable of carrying more than twice the payload of any other launch vehicle into deep space. Getting humans to Mars and back safely will be a marathon, not a sprint, which is why we advocate for a measurable, phased approach to going to Mars. Boeing, the company I work for, calls this "a path to Mars". "A path to Mars" is a scenario that reflects a four-step evolution of critical capabilities from the International Space Station to missions in the lunar vicinity in preparation for the journey of humans to Mars. Phase zero is already underway. The International Space Station has sustained humans in low Earth orbit for 16 years, producing critical science and technology that will enable humans to live in deep space as well as providing benefits to humanity on Earth. The space station lays the groundwork for global partnerships that will help us transition to working together on future platforms. Phase one includes extending our reach beyond low-Earth orbit to cislunar space, the area around the Moon, as we begin cislunar operations and what we call proving ground missions. In cislunar space we’ll prove the technologies we’ve been using and developing in low-Earth orbit. The journey to Mars will be a three-year round trip, so it’s critical that we prove our systems in deep space before taking the ultimate leap. Boeing is already working on a full-scale prototype cislunar habitat demonstrator as part of Nasa’s Next Space Technologies for Exploration Partnerships 2 programme. The crew would spend this time in cislunar space evaluating habitability, logistics, operational procedures and vehicle systems in an environment similar to what will be experienced on the journey to Mars. Building a habitat in cislunar space will offer opportunities for international partnerships and for lunar exploration and collaborative research. The habitat could also serve as a staging ground for governments and private companies that are interested in activities around or on the Moon that range from science to exploration to business and other exploration objectives. The European Space Agency has proposed the concept of a Moon village, the concept being that different people will be living and working together on the Moon. This village could be a hub for science and even tourism. An established base would provide an opportunity for countries to work together and would open up opportunities to work with the private sector. Nasa is working on a concept for how we could deploy a radio telescope on the far side of the Moon. This telescope would allow Nasa to study the universe without the interference of stars that we encounter when observing from Earth. To deploy, Kapton film material would be spread out across the lunar surface and would serve as a robust, lightweight backbone for an array of low-frequency antennas that could be deployed by a small rover launched by the Space Launch System rocket. This same technology could also be applied to a similar Mars mission. Phase two on the path to Mars includes missions to the moons of Mars or to the vicinity of the planet. In phase two we’ll have three key categories of objectives: cislunar flight testing, learning how to work in space and keeping crews healthy. There will be two main phases of operation. The first is the cislunar flight testing of exploration systems where we demonstrate that the Space Launch System and ground systems can insert both Orion (the capsule that will transport humans to Mars) and payloads into cislunar space. The second is the demonstration that Orion and mission operations can conduct crewed missions in cislunar space and to demonstrate Mars-extensible systems and mission operations that reduce risk for future long-duration deep space missions with Extravehicular Activity. In phase three, in the 2030s, we’ll travel to the surface of Mars. The vehicles and systems validated in cislunar space will be used to take the Nasa crew to Mars and back to Earth safely. The objectives in phase three include testing habitation and system functionality, testing orbit operations, validating robotic surface operations and demonstrating mission operations. The men and women who are the first to go to Mars will be a crew who has trained for such a mission in cislunar space. Perhaps those crew members are sitting in a secondary school right now studying science, technology, engineering or maths. Those men and women will have learnt how to survive in a hostile space atmosphere, provide their own medical care, grow their own food, engineer new tools and conduct research needed to improve their living conditions. Sending humans to Mars – and returning them safe and well – is the goal. That means providing them with the best advantages to do more than survive – to thrive in deep space; returning with the experience and knowledge to take humanity even farther into the universe.

Brexit May Scare Them Off Tech startup Boxarr wants to make Brexit work, but has many options if it doesn't. Residential and commercial buildings stand in central Bristol, U.K. Photographer: Chris Ratcliffe/Bloomberg by Matthew Campbell @MattCampbel More stories by Matthew Campbell March 1, 2017, 8:00 PM EST Boxarr Ltd. is exactly the kind of brainy exporter that U.K. politicians of all stripes say they want to encourage. Developing software for complex engineering projects has made it a British success story, serving such customers as Airbus SE, Safran SA and Boeing Co. from its base in Bristol. Founded in 2003 as a research project by a group of academics, the company now has 14 full-time staff and aggressive plans for international growth—an example of the entrepreneurship that Prime Minister Theresa May calls “the basis of our prosperity.” If only the country that praises companies such as Boxarr weren’t threatening to pull the rug out from under them. Alasdair Pettigrew Photographer: Chris Ratcliffe/Bloomberg Under the Brexit deal May is proposing, employees from elsewhere in the European Union who now can work freely in the U.K. may face stringent visa rules. Even if labor isn’t an issue, a post-separation economic slump could dry up investment. A dearth of talent or capital would make it harder for Boxarr to fulfill its global ambitions from the U.K., explained Chief Executive Officer Alasdair Pettigrew. In that case, it won’t hesitate to move elsewhere. “Boxarr is going to be a global titan of technology,” Pettigrew said in a meeting room in the government-backed startup incubator that Boxarr calls home. “I’d love to put U.K. in front of that, but it’s not a prerequisite. The most important thing is that our growth is not inhibited in any way, so the politicians have to make sure the environment is healthy for business." Pettigrew’s concerns are a variant on those faced by many U.K. businesses as the country embarks on an unprecedented political and economic experiment. Boxarr is one of four companies that Bloomberg will follow throughout the two-year process, during which the U.K. will depart the EU and define a new relationship with its most important trading partners. That Boxarr could thrive in Bristol, nestled on the banks of the River Avon about 120 miles from London, is the result in part of Britain’s international orientation. The western U.K. is one of the world’s most vibrant aerospace hubs, part of an integrated European supply chain that stretches across a borderless continent. Building planes and ships is one of the main applications of Boxarr’s software. The technology allows engineers to visualize efficiently the interactions between millions of objects, determining, for example, how a change in the design of a vessel’s hull would affect all the components that have to fit inside it. “I just knew that this thing was exactly what I was looking for,” said Pettigrew, who joined Boxarr in 2012 after more than a decade at International Business Machines Corp. Last year the company recorded sales of about $1 million; this year its goal is $5 million and breaking even, he says. Many of its current and potential customers aren’t far away. Boxarr’s first client was Rolls-Royce Plc, which maintains engines for the Spanish-built A400M transport plane in Bristol. Airbus, which uses Boxarr software to model its supply chain, has more than 4,000 local staff and makes wings for all its airliners in Wales, before shipping them to France for final assembly. And hundreds of smaller companies in the region produce everything from landing gear to oxygen masks for fighter pilots. That economic base, combined with a well-regarded university and handsome neighborhoods, has drawn talented engineers to Bristol, many of them from overseas. Boxarr’s offices are housed in the Engine Shed, a startup accelerator in an annex of the 175-year-old train station. The space buzzes with hipsters tapping away on MacBooks and holding one-on-ones in meeting nooks modeled on beachfront cottages, chatting in a spray of languages. The Engine Shed communal area. | Read more from the On Brexit’s Frontlines series. Photographer: Chris Ratcliffe/Bloomberg Pettigrew’s most immediate concern about Brexit is similar to that of many executives in technical fields -- that there simply aren’t enough skilled Brits to fill specialized jobs. “We’re just not seeing the really technically able people,” Pettigrew said of his efforts to hire locals. Boxarr already has employees from France, Spain and Greece on its small staff, and their future is uncertain. The June 23 vote against continued EU membership was widely interpreted by politicians as a backlash against immigration. May’s government hasn’t said whether the millions of Europeans already resident in the country can stay once Brexit is complete, let alone laid out the terms on which future migrants might obtain visas. That anxiety shows in Boxarr’s office. As he ambles over to chat with a colleague, a French staffer jokes that he might have to swim home across the English Channel if worse comes to worst. Still, Pettigrew says Brexit might, on the whole, present opportunities for Boxarr. Tariffs or customs inspections that could be reintroduced if the U.K. doesn’t secure a deep free-trade deal with the EU would add a new layer of complexity, interrupting supply chains and making it harder to keep track of production. That’s a selling point for a company that produces software aimed at simplifying processes. “Suddenly, overnight, everyone’s supply chains became more complicated,” he said. “We’ve immediately got a reason to go and call again on Renault-Nissan, to go and call Jaguar Land Rover, on Honda and Toyota and really help these guys build a picture of their supply chains.” The harbor in Bristol (left), and the Engine Shed communal working space where Boxarr is based (right). Photographer: Chris Ratcliffe/Bloomberg Dealing with the longer-term effects might require more than renewed sales outreach. If talent isn’t available at home, Boxarr will have to expand its footprint in North America instead, Pettigrew said, citing aerospace hubs in Raleigh, North Carolina; Seattle and Montreal as potential destinations. The company also might need to seek capital from U.S. investors, increasing the chances that management would relocate. For now, Pettigrew stresses that he’s trying to make the best of Brexit and that he doesn’t want to be seen as a “Bremoaner,” the derisive term deployed by anti-EU campaigners for opponents who don’t accept the referendum result.  He’s already identified a concrete opportunity to demonstrate that. The coming negotiations between the U.K. and the EU will be among the most challenging in history, taking in thousands of areas of legislation and balancing the interests of 28 countries, all of them interacting in unpredictable ways. Boxarr is planning to pitch its platform to the U.K. government as a tool to manage the negotiations. Software designed for building aircraft carriers and jet engines thus could be applied to the vagaries of diplomacy. After all, what process could be more complex than steering the ship of state through uncharted waters?   Terms of Service Trademarks Privacy Policy ©2017 Bloomberg L.P.

Musk declined to say who had booked the flight, how much they were paying or even specify their gender. And he made it clear that if NASA wanted to send astronauts on such a trip, the space agency would have priority over any private citizens. But the high-tech entrepreneur said he fully intends to launch the mission, and probably more like it, as part of his company’s long-range goal to send humans to Mars at some point in the future. “We’ve been approached to do a crewed mission beyond the moon from some private individuals,” Musk said. “And they’re very serious about it. We plan to do that, probably in the fourth quarter of next year. That would be on a Dragon 2 spacecraft and a Falcon Heavy rocket, which is due to do its maiden launch this summer.” An artist’s impression of a SpaceX Dragon crew capsule in low-Earth orbit. SpaceX announced plans Monday to launch two private citizens aboard a Dragon spacecraft late next year on a flight around the moon. SpaceX SpaceX is developing the crewed Dragon 2 capsule under contract to NASA to fly agency astronauts to and from the International Space Station. Boeing has a similar contract to develop a similar ferry ship to support space station operations and help end NASA’s reliance on Russia’s Soyuz. The first unpiloted test flight of a Dragon 2 spacecraft is targeted for late this year with the first crewed launch in the first half of 2018. The Government Accountability Office has cast doubts on those target dates, but SpaceX managers insist they can keep the program on track. For the moon mission, SpaceX would launch a Dragon 2 atop a heavy-lift Falcon 9 rocket made up of three core stages strapped together generating 5 million pounds of liftoff thrust. First flight of a Falcon 9 Heavy is planned for later this summer. By the time the moon mission flies, Musk said, SpaceX will have tested the Falcon 9 Heavy as well as the Dragon 2.

SpaceX The passengers on the lunar flight will be launched on a “free return” trajectory, shooting out past the moon and using lunar gravity to pull the spacecraft around for a high-speed return to Earth. “This would be approximately a weeklong mission, and it would skim the surface of the moon, go quite a bit farther out into deep space and then loop back to Earth,” Musk said. “I’m guessing, probably distance wise, maybe 300,000 or 400,000 miles.” As for the cost of the mission, Musk said his passengers expect to pay “maybe a little more than what the cost of a crewed mission to the space station would be.” Play Video CBSN SpaceX is sending two people to the moon and back SpaceX CEO Elon Musk has announced big plans to send two private citizens around the moon by 2018. CBS News space consultant Bill Harwood joins C... Depending on how one does the math under the company’s commercial crew contract with NASA and the number of expected flights by SpaceX and Boeing to and from the space station, that works out to around $58 million a ticket. How much SpaceX might actually charge for the moon mission is not yet known. But Musk views the flight as more than a business opportunity. It’s in keeping with his long-range goal of sending humans to Mars. He already plans to send an unpiloted Dragon to a landing on Mars in the 2020 timeframe. “As I think you guys know, the goal for SpaceX from its founding in 2002 has been to accelerate the advent of space exploration, ultimately with the idea of a self-sustaining civilization on Mars and making humanity multi-planetary,” he told reporters in an afternoon teleconference. “So, a critical step along the way is getting to understand what it’s like to have people in deep space.” A SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket and Dragon spacecraft lift off from Launch Complex 40 at the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station on April 8, 2016. NASA via Getty Images He said the flight would be, perhaps, riskier than a typical space mission but he said the two passengers would be well trained for emergencies. The free-return trajectory will minimmize the need for critical rocket firings to keep the spacecraft on course, utilizing the same sort of gravity assist from the moon that helped the Apollo 13 crew make its way back toward Earth. But that doesn’t mean it will be risk free. Far from it. “There is some risk here, but they’re certainly not naive,” Musk said. “We’ll do everything we can to minimize that risk, but it’s not zero.” In a posting on SpaceX’s website, the company said the passengers “already paid a significant deposit to do a moon mission.” “Like the Apollo astronauts before them, these individuals will travel into space carrying the hopes and dreams of all humankind, driven by the universal human spirit of exploration,” the company said. “We expect to conduct health and fitness tests, as well as begin initial training later this year.” The posting said “other flight teams” also have expressed interest in similar lunar swing bys “and we expect more to follow.” SpaceX thanked NASA for the commercial crew contract that is financing development of the Dragon 2 spacecraft. The Falcon 9 Heavy, the most powerful rocket since NASA’s Saturn 5, is being developed by SpaceX with company funding. “Once operational Crew Dragon missions are underway for NASA, SpaceX will launch the private mission on a journey to circumnavigate the moon and return to Earth,” the company said in its statement. “Lift-off will be from Kennedy Space Center’s historic Pad 39A near Cape Canaveral — the same launch pad used by the Apollo program for its lunar missions. “This presents an opportunity for humans to return to deep space for the first time in 45 years and they will travel faster and further into the solar system than any before them.” © 2017 CBS Interactive Inc.

Gavin Young / Gavin Young Share Adjust Comment Print The Keystone XL pipeline won’t be required to use American-made steel to earn construction approval from the Trump administration, the White House said Friday, despite U.S. President Donald Trump’s repeated claims. The president’s executive order mandating the use of U.S. steel is “specific to new pipelines or those that are being repaired,” White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders told reporters. “Since this one is already current, under construction, the steel is already literally sitting there, it would be hard to go back,” she said. That’s welcome news to TransCanada Corp. as its moves forward with the US$8-billion project that would span 1,900 kilometres from Alberta through three states — Montana, South Dakota, and Nebraska — before connecting to an existing network feeding crude to U.S. Gulf Coast refineries. The line would carry as much as 830,000 barrels of oil a day, including some from North Dakota’s Bakken shale. In 2012, Calgary-based TransCanada said it expected half of the 821,000 tons of steel needed to construct the pipeline to be produced inside of the United States. The remainder of the steel was expected to be imported from Canada, Italy, and India. Exempting Keystone XL from the president’s requirement to use American steel would seem to fly in the face of Trump’s public comments. Trump has repeatedly boasted that he forced pipeline companies to agree to use U.S. steel in their projects. During a Feb. 23 meeting with manufacturing CEOs at the White House, Trump told U.S. Steel Corp chief executive Mario Longhi that “the pipe is coming from the U.S.” for the Keystone project, as well as Energy Transfer Partners LP’s Dakota Access pipeline. During a Feb. 16 press conference, the president said that in exchange for using “the powers of government to make that pipeline happen” the administration “want them to use American steel.” He repeated the claim a day later during a tour of a Boeing Co. plant in South Carolina. “You probably saw the Keystone pipeline I approved recently, and the Dakota,” Trump said. “And I’m getting ready to sign the bill. I said, where is the pipe made? And they told me not here. I said, that’s good — add a little sentence that you have to buy American steel. And you know what? That’s the way it is. It’s the way it’s going to be.” A White House official who would only discuss the pipeline issue on the condition of anonymity said the Commerce Department was working on a plan for the president’s order requiring U.S. steel, so the administration couldn’t implement it until that effort had completed. Moreover, the official said, because the Keystone XL pipeline is currently under construction it does not count as a new, retrofitted, repaired, or expanded pipeline. TransCanada issued a statement Friday saying it continued “to be encouraged as our presidential permit application makes its way through the approval process.” “This project will support U.S. energy security, create thousands of well-paying U.S. jobs and provide substantial economic benefits,” the company said. Canada’s U.S. ambassador, David MacNaughton, said Friday in an interview that negotiations on Keystone’s route are going “extremely well” with federal authorities and “I don’t see any big hurdles” from the Trump administration. He called the outlook for the project “very positive.” The Prime Minister’s Office welcomed an earlier report from U.S. news outlet Politico that said Keystone XL pipeline project is exempt from Trump’s directive. A statement from Justin Trudeau’s spokesman said that “if confirmed,” the exemption would be a welcome recognition that the Canada and U.S. steel industries are deeply integrated and support jobs on both sides of the border. The prospects for Keystone XL, first proposed by TransCanada nearly 10 years ago, have been whipsawed for nearly a decade by Canada-U. S. politics, an increasingly powerful environmental lobby and collapsing oil prices. Former president Barack Obama cited environmental concerns when he cancelled the project in the fall of 2015. Former prime minister Stephen Harper clashed with Trump’s predecessor Barack Obama over the merits of the pipeline. At one point, Harper called approving the project a “complete no-brainer,” given its potential economic impact. At Trump’s invitation, TransCanada reapplied in January to have Keystone approved.

He says his team will continue the search ‘quietly’. — Picture by Malay MailKUALA LUMPUR, March 4 — Efforts are under way to continue the search for debris and other physical evidence which will help investigators locate Malaysian Airlines Flight MH370. Independent investigator Blaine Alan Gibson told Malay Mail although the official search had been suspended, efforts were being made by a team, including himself, to continue the search in a “low key fashion”. “The field work will continue but unless something significant surfaces it will be carried out quietly. I am doing this on my own initiative as a private citizen looking (for debris) for the families,” he said.  “Although the main debris found so far is of the honeycomb pattern composite material used on Boeing aircraft, personal effects are turning up as well and all these must be collected and documented. “It would be wrong to assume the search had reached a dead end because more clues and information are in the hands of investigators than ever before. “It is no longer a matter of groping in the dark. We have not figured out where the crash site is but at least we know the completed search area is not where we should be looking. “We have detailed drift modelling, and a new credible search area has been identified ... information is constantly turning up but there must be the political will to follow through.” MH370 with 239 passengers and crew on board disappeared after a series of course changes en route to Beijing from KL International Airport on March 8, 2014. The multinational search for MH370 was suspended on Jan 17, after investigators spent nearly three years combing the southern Indian Ocean for the airliner. It has been the most expensive aviation investigation to date, costing an estimated RM649 million, without turning up any evidence or clue on where the aircraft could be. “It was discouraging to see the lack of enthusiasm shown by authorities in recovering debris which turned up on beaches in Madagascar, which ultimately took six months to be collected,” Gibson said. “Also, suspending the search after completion of the 120,000 sq km area and ignoring the much smaller 25,000 sq km area was a premature decision.”  He said the search at the official level would need the participation of governments involved and the political will to follow through. “It is especially important that Malaysia, China and Australia get together to evaluate the facts and findings thus far before deciding the next move,” he said. Gibson felt the move to suspend the search would actually increase costs rather than save money as it would take time to assemble another effort and move assets into the area. “Cost was a factor mentioned but to stop the search and resume it at a later date without investigating the new area identified is going to incur more costs,” he said. “It would have been more practical to comb the new location, which is only a fifth of the size of the original search area.”                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Malaysian police seal off North Korean embassy in Kuala Lumpur PM summons emergency meeting of NSC as Malaysians held ‘hostage’ in Pyongyang In tit-for-tat, Malaysia bans North Korean embassy officials from leaving country (VIDEO) IGP tells media to ‘shut up’ over pastor’s abduction for his safety Apex court throws out Jawi’s bid to appeal against Kassim Ahmad’s court victory Activists file civil suit demanding Zakir Naik’s arrest One Malay coach, a Chinese school and a dream of becoming football champions How a student broke the rules to save Malaysia from the Nipah virus Hadi’s Bill no longer just a Muslim issue, Christian group says Don’t give or buy from children, say police Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: ‘Babies’ on board for Beyonce and Jay Z Reuters Video: Obama, Richard Branson go kiteboarding Reuters Video: ‘The White Helmets’ filmmakers discuss ‘Muslim ban’ Reuters Video: ‘Babies’ on board for Beyonce and Jay Z Reuters Video: Obama, Richard Branson go kiteboarding Reuters Video: ‘The White Helmets’ filmmakers discuss ‘Muslim ban’ Related Articles MH370 kin to raise US$15m to continue private search for missing loved ones Liow: MH370 search suspended due to lack of data, not funds MH370 kin to hold remembrance gathering today at Publika Liow: Final report on Flight MH370 expected to be completed this year It’s back to drawing board in search for MH370, says Liow Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2017 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | RecomN - Local Services

(KING) – Scott Brazelton admits he’s crazy. “My wife will tell you, I’m pretty much nuts,” he says. But most will agree, he’s put his crazy to good use by building a backyard roller coaster for his 3-year-old son, Wyatt. The idea came from a likely source, a theme park. “We took him to Disneyland a couple months ago and he just loved the roller coasters,” said Brazelton. The Navy pilot said that’s when his research started. “I researched it, and it actually wasn’t that complicated,” said Brazelton. But for safety sake, Brazelton also enlisted the help of Paul Gregg. Gregg is a Boeing engineer who lives in Seattle and has dedicated his retired life to building backyard roller coaster for his grandkids. He’s even written books and answered any questions Brazelton had about building a backyard coaster. It took Brazelton about two months to finish the project, working on it on the weekends. Brazelton gave Wyatt his first ride Sunday. Like any modern day father, he recorded the whole thing on a GoPro and posted it on Facebook. The video went viral, and the Brazeltons were contacted by several media outlets, and even agencies, who wanted to purchase and license their video. “It was pretty crazy, felt like we were in the twilight zone,” said Brazelton. He says the building process was fairly simple. Brazelton said Wyatt even helped him build the coaster. “The thing was less than a thousand dollars,” said Brazelton. “The metal, the PVC was from Home Depot.” Brazelton said he made the roller coaster cart out of a water barrel he bought at a homebrew supply store. Brazelton said he gave Wyatt the option to make the cart look like a rocket or plane. Since his dad is a pilot, Wyatt chose a plane. “The front of the propeller is a cake pan,” said Brazelton. “It’s just kind of pieced together.” What does the coaster use for power? Just gravity. There’s no motor. Brazelton says the momentum of the coaster’s first hill pushes the cart through the course.

By Alexander Tziamalis • 03/03/17 4:13pm Protectionism has a long history in economics. Derell Licht/Flickr The largest economy on the planet is quickly moving to a protectionist stance in its international trade. US president, Donald Trump, has spoken of withdrawing from the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal signed by his predecessor Barack Obama; renegotiating or abandoning the NAFTA trade deal with Mexico and Canada; imposing a 35% tax on every car imported to the US, and even threatening China with a 45% tax on its exports to the US. This could have important ramifications for the US and other world economies. A protectionist policy is any policy that provides an unfair advantage to a home industry versus the international competition. The practice has a long history in economics. Mercantilism – where countries augmented their power through regulation that favored their own economies – was prevalent until the 18th century. But, with trade as one of the engines of economic growth in the 19th and 20th centuries, free trade for all became the benchmark and the goal. And the US was at the forefront of establishing bodies to promote and regulate international trade such as the GATT and its successor, the World Trade Organization. Yet forms of protectionism are still used by most states today. The European Union subsidies its own farmers and bans imports of cheap agricultural products from outside the EU. China’s currency is artificially low, making its exports cheaper – long the source of friction between it and the US. And Japan helped its industries develop with cheap loans, as well as imposing heavy tariffs on imports, forbidding international investors from buying national companies and even launching local campaigns to persuade its population to buy Japanese products instead of imported goods. To be fair, Japan has now lifted most of these measures, but it only did so when its products had become highly competitive anyway. The theory Economic theory stipulates that free trade makes everything cheaper and improves the quality of products, directly benefiting everyone. This stems from the fact that different countries have different production strengths. These could be a cheap workforce, technological expertise, geography or a rare resource. The argument goes that if each country focused and specialized on what they do best or cheapest, they would produce better quality or cheaper products. These could then be traded between countries, making every consumer happier. It’s a similar principle to everyone specializing in one career and then trading things we need, rather than trying to produce everything ourselves. Free trade has lifted whole countries out of poverty. It can bring a lot of income from abroad and can push businesses towards continuous investment, hard effort and innovation to expand their international market-share. This also applies to businesses that do not export, but now need to keep their prices low and their quality high to beat the incoming competition. In addition, free trade strengthens the links between countries, boosts economic co-operation and, the argument goes, makes wars less likely – after all, it’s not wise to invade your customers and suppliers. This was a fundamental reason for the creation of the European Economic Community, the precursor to the EU, shortly after World War II. When protection is a good idea There are some important benefits to protectionism, though. As early as 1817, the founder of free trade theory in economics, David Ricardo, recognized that the outcome of free trade may well be to strengthen states with the production advantage and lead to job losses for others. In situations where capital is mobile, and without any barriers to the flow of people and investment, all production could well move to one part of the world – sound familiar? Protectionism is also a good idea when dealing with infant industries. It gives precious time to a company to invest in its production facilities, personnel skills and gain the local consumer’s trust before the national market finally opens to international competitors. The success of Japanese, South Korean and Chinese industrialization is partly due to the fact that these countries shielded their industries in their infant stages, allowing them time to grow and strengthen before they had to compete with the industries of the West. This argument can also be extended to important industries that are experiencing temporary problems. The Obama administration’s decision to bail out the US car industry in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis followed this logic. Another strong argument in favor of protectionism follows the logic of Game Theory. If your competitor countries are going to offer protection to their industries anyway, then you should offer protection to your industries, too. For example, if the US government is indirectly subsidizing the American airplane manufacturer Boeing, then EU countries have a strong case to retaliate and consider subsidizing the European company Airbus as well. If they don’t, then Boeing will eventually gain a much higher market share which, in turn, might push Airbus out of business altogether. A gamble for Trump that could pay off So there’s certainly a case for protectionism, but Trump’s proposed policies are also a gamble. The obvious danger is that if Trump’s policies are enacted in full, they will substantially increase prices in the US. For example, the car manufacturer Ford claims that if it moved every stage of its production to the US, then some of its cars would be considerably more expensive. Tariffs on imports would mean that all the goods imported from Asia, Latin America and Europe would be more expensive, too. Ford cars could get more expensive. MauricioCastroV./Flickr Faced with the debilitating effect of rising inflation, the central bank of the US, the Federal Reserve, might have to increase interest rates more aggressively to limit the damage. Higher interest rates will then further reduce the buying power of the American consumer and reduce inward investment. Plus, it is also likely that US trading partners will retaliate in kind, to the detriment of US exports and the companies that manufacture them, further hurting demand for American products. The key to success lies in the confidence and expectations of businesses and consumers. If people believe that Trump’s policies are geared towards economic growth then, as a self-fulfilling prophecy, they will bring this growth with investment and spending. A possible early indication of this sentiment could be the rise of the Dow Jones stock index following Trump’s election and an unprecedented surge in economic optimism. If American companies believe that the new policies will boost consumption of American products, rather than imports, then they have an incentive to invest in their production and hire locally. Plus, if Trump’s threat to impose huge tariffs is believed, many foreign companies that currently produce outside the US will have an incentive to relocate within its borders. Employment levels, salaries, spending and confidence by consumers and businesses will go up further, triggering even more inward investment. The most likely way that Trump’s policies could benefit the US economy, though, is simply by posing a credible threat to US trading partners. Once the outrage against his protectionist threat subsides, a number of countries will be happier to lift their own forms of protectionism against American products and sign trade deals more favorable for US exports. American governments have long tried to persuade China to allow its currency to appreciate; now Trump intends to strong-arm them.

Ross: WTO necessary but needs fine-tuning    Friday, 3 Mar 2017 | 7:24 AM ET | 07:06 While the Export-Import Bank of the United States remains a political football, small companies that do business overseas got a hopeful signal from Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross Friday when it comes to financing international deals. When asked about his stance on the Ex-Im Bank, Ross reiterated the importance of having a form of aid to finance exports in order to remain competitive. "Finance is clearly one of the mechanisms for international competition," Ross said on CNBC's "Squawk Box." "So, maybe there are some things in Ex-Im that can be fixed, maybe a different mechanism is needed. What I hope whatever comes out of it will do, is to help small businesses more." With President Donald Trump's focus on American manufacturing and business growth, the future of the Ex-Im Bank has once again comes into focus. The bank, which makes and guarantees loans and provides insurance to companies doing business overseas, benefits large corporations but can also act as a powerful financial tool for some small companies doing business abroad. show chapters Sec. Ross: Technical debate on trade balance    Friday, 3 Mar 2017 | 7:17 AM ET | 05:06 The White House's position on the bank has been hard to pinpoint. As a candidate, Trump originally opposed the bank, but in February Democratic senators said the president would support the bank and help to fill two seats on its board, which would enable it to approve larger loans of more than $10 million. The bank's support of giants like Boeing and General Electric has made it a target of conservative Republicans who view it as corporate welfare for big business. In a CNBC interview last week, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the administration is looking at the bank and is "not interested" in its subsidizing of large corporations, adding "to the extent we think the Export-Import Bank can be competitive in helping small and medium-sized businesses, that's something that is important." The Trump administration did not immediately respond to request for further comment on the president's stance, and Ross did not give a time frame on resolving the bank's vacant seats. More cash flowing to small businesses Because of the bank's current limited authority to make larger loans, it's financing less, but a greater percentage of its capital is flowing to small businesses. In fiscal 2016, the bank authorized $5 billion in deals to support $8 billion in U.S. exports, and more than 50 percent of the financing went to small businesses. In fiscal 2015, about a quarter of the bank's authorized deals — $12.3 billion to support $17 billion in U.S. exports — went to smaller companies. After a battle over its reauthorization, the Ex-Im Bank is now approved to transact business through fiscal year 2019. "Ex-Im provides financial solutions that help small businesses increase their competitiveness abroad, unlock working capital, and grow foreign sales, all the while helping to mitigate the risks of international business. About 90 percent of Ex-Im's transactions directly benefit American small businesses," said Lawton King, a spokesman for the bank. Smaller companies are a powerful force in exporting, but major barriers exist for some in entering the international arena, including a lack of knowledge of how to get started and concerns over payment, according to a 2016 survey from the National Small Business Association, a nonpartisan advocacy group. In 2015, preliminary figures show 293,000 companies in the U.S. exported goods, of which, 98 percent were small and medium-sized exporters with fewer than 500 workers, according to the International Trade Administration. Overall, using figures from 2014, about 4 percent of all U.S. companies export goods, according to the organization. "Ex-Im Bank is critical to small- and mid-sized exporters. The prospect of getting financing as an average small business is very difficult and exponentially more so when you're dealing with foreign buyers as an exporter," said Molly Day, vice president for public affairs at the National Small Business Association. "Ex-Im Bank fills a financing gap that enables small exporting firms to sell internationally, and ought to be strongly supported in any plan to bolster American competitiveness."

Speaking at the US Chamber of Commerce Aviation Summit in Washington March 2, Parker said the major Middle East airlines had received $15 billion in government subsidies. He also described Emirates Airline’s announcement in January that it would launch Dubai-Athens-New York Newark service in March as “a shot across the bow.” Dubai-based Emirates can operate the transatlantic route under fifth-freedom rights permitted in the US-UAE Open Skies agreement. But launching a second fifth-freedom route—the first was Dubai-Malpensa-New York—and going into a United Airlines hub has reignited a campaign against the Gulf carriers—Emirates, Etihad Airways and Qatar Airways—that was highly vocal in 2015 but mostly quiet last year. American, Delta Air Lines, United and some labor groups failed to get the government-to-government talks they sought on the issue in the Obama administration, although some high level conversations were held. Earlier in Thursday’s Chamber of Commerce conference, United CEO Oscar Munoz made his first detailed public comments on the Gulf carriers, making clear his firm opposition. The order of magnitude of the alleged subsidies, he said, “goes beyond anything I’ve seen before.” American’s Parker said the Gulf carriers had “taken away” the India market and if they were allowed to continue to add capacity, Dallas-Paris would be next “and our hub-and-spoke system starts to fall apart. It’s that serious.” Parker said it was not about taking jobs away from Boeing, which has sold large numbers of aircraft to the Gulf carriers, or about the principle of having a liberalized aviation policy. “We are as big a fan of Open Skies as FedEx, but what we don’t like is when the provisions of Open Skies agreements are not adhered to. We are not asking for [the agreements] to be amended,” he said. Speaking afterward with reporters, Parker said he was “highly confident” the issue would be understood by the Trump administration. “It’s certainly about American jobs,” he said. “At this point there are a number of things that could be done about the fact that they are violating [terms of the Open Skies agreements].” Speaking on a panel at the same conference after Parker’s presentation, the CEOs of Alaska Airlines, JetBlue Airways and Atlas Worldwide Holdings warned that revisiting the terms of Open Skies agreements would be a major mistake. “We very much take a different view” from American, Delta and United on the issue, JetBlue president and CEO Robin Hayes said. Responding to Munoz’s assertion that “facts” would ultimately push the US government to take action, Hayes said, “Let’s talk about some real numbers and real facts. The number of jobs [at US companies opposed to the American-Delta-United campaign, including—among others—JetBlue and FedEx Corp.] is 900,000.” He noted that the figure represents about three times more employees than American, Delta and United have combined. The US Airlines for Open Skies (USAOS), a coalition of Atlas Air Worldwide, FedEx, Hawaiian Airlines and JetBlue Airways, also issued a statement in response to remarks made by Munoz and Parker at the conference. “The legacy carriers claim to support Open Skies and competition, but the reality is their demands don’t match their rhetoric. Instead of going through traditional channels to address alleged subsidies, the legacy carriers have made political demands that would jeopardize the benefits Open Skies agreements bring to American workers, families, and communities. “When it comes to jobs, our coalition—plus the other US airlines not aligned with the legacy carriers—collectively employ more than 942,000 workers, almost three-and-a-half times the number employed by the legacy carriers,” USAOS said.

Top 5 Vendors in the Global Commercial Aircraft Leasing Market from 2017 to 2021: Technavio Technavio has published a new report on the global commercial aircraft leasing market from 2017-2021. (Graphic: Business Wire) Download Full Size Small Preview Thumbnail ???pagination.previous??? ???pagination.next??? Technavio has published a new report on the global commercial aircraft leasing market from 2017-2021. (Graphic: Business Wire) Full Size Small Preview Thumbnail Full Size Small Preview Thumbnail March 03, 2017 12:23 PM Eastern Standard Time LONDON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Technavio has announced the top five leading vendors in their recent global commercial aircraft leasing market report. This research report also lists five other prominent vendors that are expected to impact the market during the forecast period. The global commercial aircraft leasing market is propelled by numerous factors. One of these factors is the increase in the global passenger traffic, which is compelling the global airlines to increase their existing fleet sizes. This factor has also increased the significance of aircraft leasing arrangements. Growing investments by the Chinese and Irish aircraft lessors is also propelling the global commercial aircraft leasing market during the forecast period. Competitive vendor landscape There are many regional and multinational vendors in the global commercial aircraft leasing market, and the market is characterized by intense competition. However, major vendors like GECAS and AerCap dominate the market. During the forecast period, the requirement for an enhanced response time is expected to increase long-term collaboration among airlines and aircraft lessors. “Vendors with financial muscles are expected to acquire key contracts in emerging economies, including India, China, and Brazil. Low-interest rates and value-added services will help them to maintain long-term collaborations with the airlines,” says Avimanyu Basu, a lead aerospace analyst from Technavio. The growth of the major vendors depends on several factors, including the condition of the direct aircraft procurement market, government initiatives, and focus on the worldwide availability of leasing services. The vendors must extend their services to untapped international markets while reviving domestic demand to achieve sustained growth.

Riyadh lowered oil supply by 90,000 barrels a day from a month earlier to 9.78 million last month, according to a Bloomberg News survey of analysts, oil companies and ship-tracking data. It was the second month in a row that the world’s biggest crude exporter pumped below its own target of 10.06 million barrels a day. Overall, the OPEC’s production fell to 32.17 million barrels a day last month, a 65,000 barrel-a-day drop from January, the first month of the accord. AVIATION Boeing cutting Seattle jobs Boeing Co is shrinking its Seattle-area workforce by at least 1,800 jobs this year as it streamlines operations in a brutally competitive commercial-aircraft market. The planemaker approved voluntary layoffs for 1,500 mechanics, according to a person familiar with the situation who asked not to be named because it has not been made public. Another 305 engineers and technical workers are leaving voluntarily, Bill Dugovich, a spokesman for their union, said on Thursday. COSTCO Membership fees rising Costco Wholesale Corp on Thursday said that it is raising its North America membership fees, as the warehouse club operator released quarterly results that fell short of Wall Street’s expectations. Its shares fell more than 4 percent in after-hours trading. Starting June 1, annual membership fees for individual, business and business add-on members in the US and Canada will rise US$5 to US$60. Executive memberships in those two nations will increase from US$110 to US$120. The fee increases will affect about 35 million members. The Issaquah, Washington-based company reported fiscal second-quarter net income of US$515 million, or US$1.17 per share. Costco posted revenue of US$29.77 billion in the period, which also did not meet Street forecasts. INTERNET Typo causes Amazon outage Amazon.com Inc says an incorrectly typed command during a routine debugging of its billing system caused the five-hour outage of some Amazon Web Services servers on Tuesday. In a summary posted online, the Seattle company says a command meant to remove a small number of servers for one of its S3 subsystems was entered incorrectly and a larger set of servers was removed. A full restart was required, which took longer than expected due to how fast Amazon Web Services has grown over the past few years. Amazon says it is making changes to its system to make sure incorrect commands would not trigger an outage of its Web services in the future. ENTERTAINMENT Spotify hits 50 million mark Spotify Ltd on Thursday said it has reached 50 million paid subscribers, growing 25 percent in less than six months and extending the Swedish music streaming service’s lead over its closest rival, Apple Music. Spotify, which has not yet shown a profit as it spends to grow internationally, is considering a potential US stock market listing, according to a February TechCrunch report. The Stockholm-based company said in February that it would move its New York office to the World Trade Center from the Midtown area of Manhattan, adding more than 1,000 new jobs. Launched in 2008, Spotify had 40 million paid subscribers in September last year. This story has been viewed 2867 times. Comments will be moderated.

Virgin’s newest company is Virgin Orbit, a small satellite specialist Posted Mar 3, 2017 by Darrell Etherington (@etherington) 0 SHARES Next Story GM’s new Maven Reserve service offers monthly vehicle rentals Virgin’s business in space just got a little busier – the company founded by Richard Branson just launched a new operation called Virgin Orbit, which becomes its own subsidiary company alongside Virgin Galactic and The Spaceship Company in Virgin’s space roster. Virgin Orbit will focus on dedicated launches of small satellites (smallsats), and will be headed up by Dan Hart, a longtime Boeing vet who acted as VP of Government Satellite Systems at his last gig. Virgin Orbit isn’t the group’s first crack at the can when it comes to launching small satellites, which are a relatively new category of device that offer advantages in terms of cost, production time and launch volume and that can operate in low Earth orbit (LEO) for functions like setting up a communications network, space-based imaging and more. The new company was operating under Virgin Galactic as LauncherOne, the namesake of the small satellite launch system that Virgin has been working on, and which is already in the “advanced phase of hardware testing for every subsystem and major component of the vehicle,” according to the company’s press release announcing the news. Small satellite operations are quickly becoming big business, with many small private participants emerging. Alternatives like World View are also taking different approaches to similar market needs, and legacy players like Boeing are reimagining aspects of their operation to stay more competitive with new entrants in this space. 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Newsletter Subscriptions The Daily Crunch Get the top tech stories of the day delivered to your inbox TC Weekly Roundup Get a weekly recap of the biggest tech stories Crunchbase Daily The latest startup funding announcements Enter Address Subscribe SEE ALL NEWSLETTERS » Latest Crunch Report Jay Z Has Arrived | Crunch Report Watch More Episodes Space Popular Posts Featured Stories Jay Z Has Arrived | Crunch Report VIDEO | 3:21 | Crunch Report Amazon’s AWS buys Thinkbox Software, maker of tools for creative professionals 11 hours ago | Ingrid Lunden Should Snap buy Twitter? 12 hours ago | Alex Wilhelm, Jonathan Shieber Justin Kan launches his own startup incubator program called Zero-F 12 hours ago | Jon Russell Snap tumbles 12% on day three, erases gains 12 hours ago | Katie Roof Latest From TechCrunch Land Rover’s new Discovery search and rescue SUV has a roof-mounted drone 16 minutes ago | Darrell Etherington How the M14 Industries Dragons’ Den deal collapsed 31 minutes ago | Steve O'Hear Samsung Pay is now live in India 49 minutes ago | Jon Russell Safaricom and mSurvey launch Consumer Wallet to map Africa’s cash economy 3 hours ago | Jake Bright Comment moderation powered by Up Next GM’s new Maven Reserve service offers monthly vehicle rentals Posted Mar 3, 2017 CrunchBoard Job Listings Mobile User Experience Designer (UX) - TrainingPeaks at Peaksware (Boulder, CO, United States) Director of Community & Business Development (YC-backed) at Paragon One (New York, NY, United States) Lead Web Developer @ Numerai at Numerai (San Francisco, CA, United States) Senior Software Engineer- Fullstack/Backend @ Sift Science at Sift Science (San Francisco, CA, United States) SysAdmin DevOps at Peaksware (Boulder, CO, United States) More from CrunchBoard Advertisement TechCrunch News Video Events Crunchbase TechCrunch Store About Staff Contact Us Advertise With Us Event & Editorial Calendar Send Us A Tip International China Europe Japan Follow TechCrunch Facebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn Youtube Pinterest Tumblr Instagram StumbleUpon Feed TechCrunch Apps iOS Android Windows 8 Subscribe to The Daily Crunch Latest headlines delivered to you daily Subscribe to <span class="no-mobile">Subscribe to </span>The Daily Crunch Enter Email Address Subscribe © 2013-2017 AOL Inc.

A small peek comes from the latest episode of PBS' "Antiques Roadshow", of all places. The show stops in Palm Springs, Calif., and finds some forgotten parts of the Columbia space module, which brought Buzz Aldrin, Neil Armstrong, and Michael Collins back to Earth. View photos Photo credit: NASAMore The module, no. 107, manufactured by North American Rockwell, was one of the three parts of the Apollo spacecraft, and only one to return to Earth. With its cramped living conditions and utilitarian purpose, Columbia was not given the same romantic fanfare as some other space artifacts. "When the spacecraft would come back to Downey [Calif.], we would strip them all down," explains a retired North American Aviation (now Boeing) engineer, whose name is not given on the show. "And so this arrow... they were scraping all this stuff off and throwing it away in a big pile, so they just gave it to me." "This stuff" turned out to include a had been affixed to Columbia's crew access hatch, with the arrow in question pointing to the panel to gain entrance to the crew cabin. While the cabin was expected to be opened from the inside, the decal was meant to help in the case of an emergency. The label is pretty beat up, reflective of its journey through the Earth's atmosphere and into splashdown. The engineer also presents small pieces which represent the personal pride the engineers took in their work on Apollo, including assembly parts tags. "This label another guy gave to me because I was the final person to stamp it, saying 'Hey, we've got a good product," the owner says on "Antiques Roadshow." "This is the serial number, '107.' So we called it '107' and when it went to [Cape Canaveral], it became Apollo 11." View photos Photo credit: WGBHMore This isn't the first time that Apollo 11 has featured on the PBS show, with smaller parts of the mission popping up and showcasing the sheer amount of effort that went into its smallest details. Ever since Jeff Bezos worked with conservators in 2013 to drag up key components of the module from the ocean floor, interest in Columbia has increased. The module itself is currently the target of a major restoration effort with a goal of protecting its famous heat shield from degradation. After 40 years in the National Air and Space Museum, the plan is that after the restoration, it will go on a roadshow of its own, going to Houston, St. Louis, Pittsburgh and Seattle before returning to DC. Columbia's going to get its moment in the sun, which, with any luck, might bring more lost artifacts out of the woodwork.

Asker | Aviation Week & Space Technology EMAIL Tweet Comments 2 Advertisement John Tracy, whose career crossed space, defense and commercial applications, and who was an early proponent of composites, is a 2017 Philip J. Klass Lifetime Achievement Award honoree.  When Tracy retired in 2016, he was Boeing’s chief technologist and its senior vice president of engineering. It was a far cry from where he began.  A native of Southern California, Tracy earned a degree in physics from California State University-Dominguez Hills. After college, he became a high school teacher. After being laid off three times in three years, he turned to industry for opportunities. But his classroom experience was invaluable later.  In 1979, Tracy got a job at chemical and munitions manufacturer Hercules as a detonation analyst. By 1981, he had moved on to McDonnell Douglas (now part of Boeing), where he worked on Delta launch vehicles.  Aviation Week’s 60th Annual Laureate Awards See the 2017 winners “I became convinced that composites were the future,” Tracy says. He pushed for the use of composites in Delta rocket fairings. While there is no “free lunch” in engineering, Tracy saw composites as presenting a golden opportunity to improve system performance and reduce manufacturing costs simultaneously.  At Boeing, the development of the 787 brought composites to its biggest test. Tracy knew the company’s engineering team had to show that composites could be used to economically manufacture an airplane and that the aircraft would pass certification. The program had significant hiccups, not just related to composites, of course. Still, Tracy recalls some uncomfortable moments before the company’s board of directors where he had to defend the decision to go with a “plastic” airplane.  Tracy believes one of his chief achievements at Boeing was centralizing its test and evaluation capabilities across its defense, space and commercial operations. Without that, his cohorts say, rollouts and deliveries of such products as the 787 and 747-8 would have slipped further. But those who know him cite his overall leadership abilities, and here’s where we go back to high school. Asked about his experience with students and the relevance in aerospace, he said: “You learn how to communicate, to honor them, to respect them, to help them grow, encourage them. We end up doing more than we thought we could.”  Tracy remains bullish on the future of aerospace and its ability to attract a new generation of engineering talent. “People don’t realize everything they touch, in one way or another, is enabled by aerospace or is a spinoff from aerospace,” he says. “We have had more impact on the world than any other industry.” Print Favorite EMAIL Tweet Discuss this Article 2 mikeBFM on Mar 3, 2017 Congratulations Mr. John Tracey Log In or Register to post comments esimonsen@earth... on Mar 4, 2017 John - Congratulations on your Lifetime Achievement Award - well deserved.

On Wednesday, a two-stage United Launch Alliance (ULA) Atlas V rocket, carrying the classified NROL-79 satellite, took off from the Vandenberg Air Force Base in Southern California. ULA, a Lockheed Martin–Boeing joint venture, built the Atlas V rocket to carry the confidential payload for the US National Reconnaissance Office (NRO), a once-secret organization that oversees the US' constellation of spy satellites.  #NROL79 will carry a national security payload designed, built and operated by the NRO.

At the time, the rocket travels 140 miles from the launchpad and is located at an altitude of 77.5 miles (124.7 kilometers).  The booster engine cuts off after the rocket is travelling at 8,700mph (14,001kph), four minutes and three seconds after liftoff. At the time, the rocket travels 140 miles from the launchpad and is located at an altitude of 77.5 miles (124.7 kilometers).  "A launch like this requires thousands of hours of activity and practice to execute successfully," Lieutenant Colonel Eric Zarybnisky, 4th Space Launch Squadron commander, said, according to the Vandenberg Air Force Base. "Engineers and technicians from my squadron work with members of the United Launch Alliance to ensure a successful launch like this one." Wednesday’s mission marks ULA’s second launch this year and the 117th successful launch since the company was formed in 2006. ULA plans for a total of 11 missions in 2017, and claims to have had a 100 percent success rate in the past ten years of launches. The launch was originally scheduled for December 1, but was pushed back after wildfires endangered the mission. ULA dedicated the mission to Ryan Osler, an 18-year veteran of the Ventura County Fire Department, who died in a crash on his way to fight the Canyon Fire at the Vandenberg Air Force Base in September. #AtlasV#NROL79 mission is dedicated in memory of Ventura County FD's Ryan Osler, who was killed en route to fight the Canyon Fire in Sept pic.twitter.com/42VRe9wnbq— ULA (@ulalaunch) March 1, 2017 “Tragically, Ventura County firefighter Ryan Osler lost his life en route to assist in fighting the fire. We are honored to dedicate today’s mission to Ryan and his family,” Laura Maginnis, vice president of custom services at ULA, said in the press release after the launch. “Thank you to all of the men and women who worked to deliver this critical asset for our nation’s security.”  In his honor, ULA technicians painted an inscription on the Atlas V booster, saying, “Friend, Father, and Fallen Hero. Ryan S. Osler, Ventura County Fire Department. 1978-2016,” according to the Vandenberg Air Force Base. While it is unclear what the classified NROL-79 satellite will be doing in space, the NRO says that their satellites provide critical capabilities for American security, communications, navigation, intelligence, and serve as an early warning system of missile launches. They also say the satellites support natural disaster relief, and environmental research for climate change scientists.  ULA's next launch is set for March 8, where they plan to launch the Delta IV WGS-9 satellite for the US Air Force at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Florida.

Richard Branson Announces New Space Company, Tries Pulling A Reverse Musk™ Matt Novak Mar 3, 2017, 12:30pm ⋅ Filed to:  reverse musk virgin galactic virgin orbit Share "I hope in five years a reusable rocket will have been developed which can take up to 10 people at a time to stay at the Virgin Hotel for two weeks," Richard Branson proudly announced back in 1999. We're still waiting on Branson's Virgin Galactic to take tourists into space, despite the promises of the past two decades that he would do just that. But Branson has a new idea for the meantime: Why not launch small satellites into space? Called Virgin Orbit, Branson's newest space venture will be led by former Boeing executive Dan Hart. "By offering low cost and frequent service to space, the team is revolutionising the small satellite market within the promising space economy," Branson bragged on his blog. Branson's space strategy, however, is a little odd, so we've come up with a name for it: The Reverse Musk™. How do you pull off a Reverse Musk™? You start with the really hard stuff and then give up and try the more humble projects you should have been working on two decades ago. Elon Musk founded SpaceX in 2002 with bold dreams of eventually propelling humans into space — to Mars and beyond. But Musk realised that you had to start with the more modest stuff. Over the next decade, SpaceX built rockets and sent capsules to the International Space Station, and launched satellites. And all of those things paid off. Musk now talks about how he wants to send space tourists around the moon by the end of 2018. And even though it's a tremendously ambitious goal, some people believe he can do it. Why? Musk started with the "smaller" stuff like launching satellites. Getting humans to the moon and Mars may have been the ultimate goal, but Musk clearly knew that you had to learn to walk before you could run. Branson has always been about the opposite. Yes, he's been developing his own rockets, and spaceships — one that tragically and infamously exploded in 2014, killing a pilot. But he only recently pursued private contracts to do the more modest stuff, like launching satellites into space, that ultimately teaches lessons that you can use for manned space travel. Branson did, however, get the state of New Mexico to pay $US250 ($330) million for a spaceship graveyard. So it's not like he wasn't busy spending other people's money. Just not in a way that benefited very many people. "It has been my longheld dream to open access to space to change the world for good," Branson said in a statement about his new company. "We have been striving to do that by manufacturing vehicles of the future, enabling the small satellite revolution, and preparing commercial space flight for many more humans to reach space and see our home planet." "I'm thrilled that our small satellite launch service has now progressed to the point it merits the formation of its own company, Virgin Orbit, and a new president in Dan with decades of deep experience and success in a broad variety of space programs." Will Virgin Orbit be successful? Hopefully. But it's really something he should have started with back in the 2000s. "Virgin Galactic officials said 100 people already have paid $US200,000 ($264,310) apiece to fly into space," a story from the Associated Press in 2005 promised. "They include actress Victoria Principal, who told the news conference she looked forward to being on the first civilian flight of Virgin Galactic, perhaps as soon as 2008." Like we said, we're still rooting for Branson's The Reverse Musk™, even if he has almost 20 years of failed promises in his wake. Hopefully this one takes off. Do you get it? I said, I hope this one takes off. Like the spaceships. They take off. Comments brettanthony @brettanthony Mar 3, 2017, 5:37pm Tries Pulling A Reverse Musk I dont know about you, but I really hope a "Reverse Musk" is a shithot sexual position. Reply 1 john_c @john_c Mar 3, 2017, 9:58pm I know competition is good for a lot of industries, but imagine if they pooled their resources. Reply 0 Andy Oliphant Guest Mar 4, 2017, 12:36pm There are some articles that instantly lose all credibility with me, and this is one of them. "...one that tragically and infamously exploded in 2014, killing a pilot." I believe the buzz term would be FAKE NEWS! There was never an explosion. A pilot made a deadly error and activated a brake mechanism at unsafe speeds, causing the ship to break apart. There was absolutely nothing wrong with the spacecraft. That's like saying "a car tragically & infamously blew up when it was thrown into reverse while driving 90mph on the freeway." Reply 0 Join the discussion!

Submissions: tips@geekwire.com An artist’s conception shows Virgin Orbit’s carrier airplane, Cosmic Girl, deploying a LauncherOne rocket for a high-altitude orbital launch. (Virgin Galactic Illustration) Virgin Galactic says it’s spinning off its satellite launch operation, including the LauncherOne rocket development program, as a new commercial space company called Virgin Orbit. The newly created company’s first president, Dan Hart, comes to the job from the Boeing Co., where he most recently served as vice president of government satellite systems. “I’m thrilled that our small-satellite launch service has now progressed to the point it merits the formation of its own company, Virgin Orbit, and a new president in Dan with decades of deep experience and success in a broad variety of space programs,” Virgin Group founder Richard Branson said today in a news release. Virgin Group now has three companies in its commercial space portfolio, which is known as Galactic Ventures: Virgin Galactic, which focuses on human spaceflight services. It’s based in Mojave, Calif., for flight testing, and aims to conduct commercial space tours out of Spaceport America in New Mexico. The Spaceship Company, which is headquartered in Mojave and focuses on the design, manufacture and testing of aerospace vehicles such as SpaceShipTwo and its twin-fuselage White Knight Two carrier airplane. Virgin Orbit, which focuses on the small-satellite launch services that will be provided by LauncherOne and its Cosmic Girl carrier airplane, a modified Boeing 747 jet. Virgin Orbit is headquartered in a 180,000-square-foot manufacturing facility in Long Beach, Calif., where more than 200 employees are working on LauncherOne and Cosmic Girl. Test launches could start as early as this year, and the company already has a substantial waiting list for orbital launches. Dan Hart. (Virgin Orbit Photo) Hart said he was thrilled to be joining the Virgin team. “In 34 years at Boeing, I’ve had the honor to work on some of the most iconic and successful space programs in history, including the space shuttle, the Delta launch program and satellite systems that have connected the world and protected our nation,” he said in a statement. Heading Virgin Orbit will be the “perfect next challenge,” Hart said. Hart joins a team that also includes Virgin Galactic President Mike Moses, a former NASA shuttle launch manager; The Spaceship Company’s chairman, Doug Shane, who’s a veteran of the SpaceShipOne development program at Scaled Composites; and Enrico Palermo, who has just been named The Spaceship Company’s executive vice president and general manager. Galactic Ventures’ CEO, George T. Whitesides, said the updated organizational structure “positions each Virgin space company to achieve its full potential while remaining true to our shared purpose of opening space to all.” Galactic Ventures is majority-owned by Virgin Group – but Aabar Investments PJS, a venture firm based in Abu Dhabi, holds a minority stake.

Getty Images Advertisement Boeing Co. is shrinking its Seattle-area workforce by at least 1,800 jobs this year as the company streamlines operations in a brutally competitive commercial-aircraft market. The planemaker approved voluntary layoffs for 1,500 mechanics, according to a person familiar with the situation who asked not to be named because it hasn’t been made public. Another 305 engineers and technical workers are leaving voluntarily, Bill Dugovich, a spokesman for their union, said Thursday.  Boeing told employees in December that it would seek buyouts as part of an effort to cut costs and match employment to market requirements, company spokesman Paul Bergman said by email. Boeing also plans to cull commercial-airplane jobs by leaving open positions unfilled and through involuntary layoffs, he said. He declined to say how many buyouts have been approved. Popular Now Lean Supply Chains Make Winners of Us All 12 Key Strategies to Achieving a Work-Life Balance Five Rules for Selecting the Best KPIs to Drive Operational Improvement The Chicago-based manufacturer has been winnowing employment in the Puget Sound area, its largest industrial base, over the past year as sales slowed for the jetliners, which accounted for 69% of total revenue last year. Boeing has trimmed its Washington state workforce by 9.2% to 71,036 since the start of last year, even as Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg has emerged in meetings with President Donald Trump as an advocate for U.S. manufacturing. Those earlier cuts included about 1,000 members of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers and 850 members of the Society of Professional Engineering Employees in America who applied for voluntary layoffs. Another 350 SPEEA members lost their jobs involuntarily, Dugovich said. Boeing officials last week told the engineering union to “expect a similar reduction in workforce in our units as we experienced last year,” he said.

The reductions had been announced last year and workers had until Feb. 1 to apply. “These are all voluntary, where people planned to retire or had other plans,” said Connie Kelliher of District 751 of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers. Another 305 engineers and technical workers are leaving voluntarily, said Bill Dugovich, a spokesman for their union, the Society of Professional Engineering Employees in Aerospace. Boeing offered the buyouts to workers last year as part of an 8 percent workforce reduction at its commercial airplane business. The unit had about 74,600 workers at the end of February. Boeing said in December that it would cut an as-yet-undetermined number of jobs in 2017. What's going up: Read the Building Blocks blog Who's hired?

Boeing has said its reductions will come through voluntary layoffs, retirements and in some cases involuntary layoffs. But no machinists have had involuntary layoffs for several years, Kelliher said. Boeing’s shares fell 0.5 percent to close Thursday at $182.99. Reuters and Bloomberg contributed to this report. Business Briefing from St. Louis Post-Dispatch Make it your business.

(AP Photo/Pablo Martinez Monsivais) Moody's: 'Trump bump' will revive defense industry By Paul Bedard (@SecretsBedard) • 3/2/17 2:52 PM Paul Bedard Washington Secrets The Washington Examiner http://s3.amazonaws.com/content.washingtonexaminer.biz/images/static/authors/headshot-PBedardHR.jpg Share Tweet Mail Print SMS More President Trump's decision to pour more money into the Pentagon will spark a revival of the defense industry especially with giants like Lockheed Martin, General Dynamics, Huntington Ingalls, and Boeing, according to a report from Moody's Investors Service. Two days after Trump unveiled his plan to boost spending 10 percent, Moody's concluded, "We believe the base defense funding request provides a clear statement of intent to prioritize defense spending, lending further support to our positive industry outlook and confirmation of an improving market environment for defense contractors after the prolonged 2012-15 downturn." Defense spending, especially on big programs, has been stalled under the budget sequestrations during the Obama years. The report said that if sequestration is lifted, "confidence in the longer-term defense budgetary trend would improve further. Under such a scenario, we believe agencies would be able to undertake new programs more aggressively, and contractors could more readily undertake otherwise riskier investments and company-sponsored R&D projects."

The report also suggested that potential cuts in foreign aid will help contractors as U.S. allies arm up to make up for the loss of help from Washington. The report said: The proposed Trump bump in defense spending is thereby a doubly welcome development for industry participants. Elevated geopolitical tensions and rising security concerns are a global phenomenon that should also bolster industry coffers, more broadly. Reduced support for U.S. allies is also likely to lead to higher defense spending by these countries, as they increasingly need to defend their own borders. But heightened tensions related to a potential withdrawal of US support also pose the risk of curtailed purchases of US-made equipment and services.

Barry Schwartz on March 2, 2017 at 11:57 am More Google announced they now let you search using sequences of two or three special characters, something many coders do when looking for programming help in search. So now you can go to Google and search for technical queries such as [== vs ===] and [+=]. Google gave the example, if you’re searching for the meaning of [c++17], you will get results for the well-known programming language instead of c17, which brings up a Boeing airplane. Here is an example of a search result page for such technical queries: Google also made it better for organization and product names that include punctuation.

Written by Editorial | Published:March 3, 2017 12:20 am The world’s most prominent Muslim nation has reached out to the world’s most populous Muslim nation, and something heavy is going down. King Salman is the first Saudi monarch to visit Indonesia in half a century, and his baggage allowance compensates for the delay. His entourage is 1,000 strong, packs 460 tonnes of luggage and needs a fleet of aircraft to lug it around. This is giving the world’s media heartburn. Are royals easily picked on because they are the excess baggage of history? No one complains when the democratically elected president of the United States carries his famous Beast overseas, in the hold of his own aircraft, which itself is so ridiculously expensive that Donald Trump wanted the contract with Boeing cancelled. It is as normal for POTUS to carry a small tank overseas as it is for a milkman to load his bicycle onto the local train — the man can’t possibly walk the last mile. But when a Saudi royal packs a few sets of Michelin wheels for the perfectly innocuous purpose of zipping around in Bali, it is suddenly the subject of breathlessly derisive media commentary. It’s simply unfair. Watch What Else Is Making News And so what if 150 chefs travelled to feed King Salman’s delegation of 1,000? Cleopatra would have had 1,000 official tasters, too — one per potential target, prepared to lay down their lives on the field of diplomatic banquetry. But we have left those benighted times behind, when danger lurked in every morsel. We now only fear lifts, which is why the Saudi delegation has packed two of it own. If you have ever been trapped in a public lift with an expired maintenance contract, you would appreciate the reason why. King Salman’s Indonesia jaunt offered an opportunity for the world’s media to rise above such pettiness. It is failing the test.

TAIT Steve McDonald, a Sheet Metal Assembly Riveter for Boeing helps assemble parts in a F/A-18 EF Super hornet nose barrel, while working on the production line, at their Hazelwood assembly plant in St. Louis, Mo. Monday, Sept. 15, 2003. (AP Photo/ St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Gabriel B. Tait) WASHINGTON • An early draft of the next federal budget calls for 14 new F/A-18 Super Hornets as part of a broader military buildup.  The order for more Super Hornets, manufactured in St. Louis by Boeing, still needs to clear several hurdles, including the House and Senate budgeting committees that could change the aircraft total — or nix it entirely.  But the early inclusion in the spending plan suggests lawmakers are following a direction outlined by President Donald Trump, who last month said "we're looking at a big order" of Super Hornets. The proposal comes at a time when nearly two-thirds of the Navy's existing fleet of Super Hornets are "not flyable" on a given day, a Navy vice-admiral told Congress. Frequent missions to bomb terror targets have worn down the aircraft.  The Navy included 14 of the planes on its "unfunded priorities" list last year, but the Barack Obama administration had requested only two.   Rep. Ann Wagner, R-Ballwin, is scheduled next week to testify to a House budget subcommittee about the importance of the new jets. "In addition to protecting our families from rising terrorist threats, funding for the jets will secure thousands of vital jobs in St. Louis and across Missouri," she said in a statement. "Recognizing the Navy’s operational aircraft shortfall, I have fought for Super Hornet funding each year I’ve been in Congress." Kuwait has also requested 28 Super Hornets, with an option for a total order of 40 aircraft.  Meet the best small businesses to work at in St. Louis Get the Bottom Line from Nicklaus and Gallagher See how much St. Louis CEOs were paid What's going up: Read the Building Blocks blog The $583.7 billion budget blueprint for the military also calls for 61 new Blackhawk helicopters (the Pentagon requested only 36), more than a dozen new Navy ships, three new littoral combat ships and 74 F-35s (11 more than the Obama administration requested).  That spending plan — about $1 billion above what the Pentagon requested in its fiscal year 2017 outline — would amount to a nearly 6 percent boost in military spending.  The Trump administration has proposed paying for that military buildup by slashing other areas of domestic spending, like the Environmental Protection Agency and the State Department. Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have downplayed that idea, with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., saying the State Department spending can be more effective than military allocations.  The country with the next-highest military spending is China, which budgeted $146.6 billion last year.  Business Briefing from St. Louis Post-Dispatch Make it your business.

Find out how the Dow's best dividend stocks are faring. Dan Caplinger (TMFGalagan) Mar 2, 2017 at 11:40AM The Dow Jones Industrials (DJINDICES:^DJI) have been on fire so far in 2017, setting new all-time records on more than a dozen occasions in the first two months of the year and climbing above the 21,000 level for the first time on March 1. Yet rather than investing in the entire Dow, some dividend investors follow a strategy known as the Dogs of the Dow, which involves picking just a handful of the components that make up the venerable average. Two months in and after a huge rally, now's a good time to check in and see how the Dogs of the Dow are faring and what explains their performance in 2017. How the Dogs of the Dow are faring in 2017 To find out which stocks make up the Dogs of the Dow, you just have to do one simple thing. Pick the 10 stocks as of the end of 2016 that had the highest dividend yields, and then buy shares of them in equal dollar amounts. Then, hold onto all 10 stocks throughout the year. So far in 2017, the Dogs of the Dow are lagging slightly behind the Dow overall. On average, the Dogs are up 5%, compared to a nearly 7% return for the unmodified Dow. The biggest reason for the poor performance from the Dogs of the Dow is that three of the 10 stocks the strategy tracks have lost ground in 2017, compared to just five overall for the Dow 30. The biggest loser has been ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM), which has had to deal with renewed concerns about whether the energy markets can keep clawing back more of the ground that they lost during the plunge in crude oil prices in 2015. Chevron (NYSE:CVX) has also produced year-to-date losses for similar reasons. In addition, Verizon (NYSE:VZ) has had to deal with new price-war considerations, including the potential merger of its No. 3 and No. 4 rivals in the U.S. wireless telecom industry, and is also reacting adversely to threats of higher interest rates. Another reason for underperformance is that the Dogs didn't get to include the year's best performer so far. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has jumped more than 20%, carrying forward momentum from 2016 as investors have regained confidence in the company's long-term prospects. Even though some investors worry that a lack of innovative new products in Apple's visible pipeline pose a long-term threat to the growth of the business, the company has still been able to use the iPhone's success and the loyalty toward its ecosystem to drive business. Don't count the Dogs out That said, the Dogs of the Dow have had their share of success stories. Cisco Systems and Merck have risen by double-digit percentages, but the most important winner so far in 2017 has been Boeing (NYSE:BA), which has climbed 18% since the beginning of the year. Calls from the Trump administration to increase defense spending have helped push the aerospace and defense giant higher, and a strong commercial aerospace market continues to make investors optimistic about Boeing. Yet even here, the Dogs of the Dow haven't benefited as much as the Dow 30, because Boeing's high share price has produced outsized gains for the average but not for the equal-weighted Dogs. More importantly, it's still early in the year. The Dogs of the Dow tend to move in a manner similar to a value-based strategy, rewarding stocks that have lagged in the past. That's very much not the way that the stock market has acted lately, instead riding positive momentum from late 2016 and continuing to reward earlier winners rather than creating a rotation of new gainers. In particular, the Dogs include several stocks that could benefit greatly from anticipated growth in certain sectors. Caterpillar in particular is well poised to boost its profits in North America if construction and infrastructure activity rise going forward. Pharmaceutical stocks have gotten hit hard recently, but if healthcare reform avoids major pressure to their profit, then the shares could rebound and help the Dogs to a greater extent than they would the overall Dow 30. The Dogs of the Dow are lagging slightly behind the overall Dow, but that doesn't mean that the strategy is a bad one to use. A lot can happen over the rest of 2017, and you should watch closely to see if the Dogs of the Dow can catch up and surpass the Dow 30 in the months to come.

Share Adjust Comment Print There’s been some discussion about the interim Super Hornet purchase lately as those against the deal try to rally public support for their cause. Thirteen former RCAF generals tried to make a splash in the media before the deal was signed. They recently issued a letter calling on Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to cancel the proposed purchase of the Super Hornet. And on Tuesday, the Ottawa Citizen published an opinion piece written by retired RCAF colonel and former Conservative MP Laurie Hawn. Hawn, a long-time supporter of the F-35 stealth fighter, also attacked the Super Hornet deal. Hawn’s views aren’t that surprising since he has been publicizing them in various venues since the interim Super Hornet proposal emerged in the summer of 2016. The Liberals have dismissed both the criticisms from Hawn and the generals. They believe the publicity campaign is being orchestrated largely by F-35 manufacturer Lockheed Martin and its lobbyists, who of course have a lot to gain if the Super Hornet purchase was scuttled. Other critics point to the current and former industrial ties of some of the 13 generals to either Lockheed Martin or other aircraft competing against the Super Hornet. But Hawn and the generals point out that they are speaking out because they are worried about the future of the RCAF and the security of the country. It doesn’t appear though that anything is going to stop this purchase. Public Services and Procurement Canada has just released an update today (Thursday) indicating that the negotiations are proceeding. It provides more information on how the purchase of the interim Super Hornets will unfold. The department noted that it has been meeting regularly with the United States government and Boeing to discuss the proposed purchase and how it would proceed through the U.S. Foreign Military Sales program. More from Public Services and Procurement Canada: This program offers the primary means by which we can purchase defence articles controlled by the U.S. under the Arms Export Control Act, and can offer cost and schedule benefits by allowing us to join with the U.S in its purchasing activity. Under this program, the U.S. Department of Defense is the supplier to partner countries. Under the U.S. Foreign Military Sales program, defence equipment is procured through a government-to-government agreement, whereby the U.S. Department of Defense is the supplier. We met with representatives of the Australian government, who shared their lessons learned regarding their 2007 purchase of Super Hornet aircraft as an interim replacement for their existing fleet. Ongoing meetings with the United States Navy – We are discussing costing and training concepts. Summer and fall 2017 We expect the following events to occur: The United States government takes its necessary steps After the U.S. Department of Defense receives our letter of request, it will: work with Boeing and other suppliers to develop a proposal conduct the necessary internal U.S. government consultations notify the U.S. Congress These steps usually take six to eight months to complete. The United States government response A letter of offer and acceptance is expected as early as fall 2017, which is a response from the U.S. government outlining how it would meet Canada’s requirements. Reviewing and finalizing Industrial and Technological Benefits Policy side agreements Prior to signing any agreement, we will review and finalize side agreements with potential U.S. government contractors to ensure they maximize economic benefits for Canadian industry. Reviewing the letter of offer and acceptance The government will ensure the offer meets Canada’s requirements at a cost, schedule and level of capability acceptable to Canada. Signing a bilateral agreement with the United States government The Government of Canada may sign an agreement to purchase 18 new Super Hornet aircraft and elements of associated in-service support as soon as the end of 2017 or early 2018.     Boeing Company Laurie Hawn Lockheed Martin Corporation Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II sponsored Super Hornet Polish, U.S. and Canadian soldiers take part in large winter warfare...

And the US media, for its part, entered a phase that might be described as "learning to love the Donald." Almost universally, the major media outlets -- many of which were denounced only last week by Trump as "the enemies of the people" -- presented Trump's speech as a tour de force, a truly "presidential" address that marked a "pivot" for his administration. Trump's language and tone in the address were interpreted as a signal that he is serious about getting Congressional approval for his right-wing, pro-corporate measures, that he will not let factional infighting get in the way of showering Wall Street with riches. The stock markets followed suit, with the Dow-Jones Industrial Average rising more than 300 points Wednesday to end above 21,000 for the first time ever. Financial stocks led the rally, with JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Citigroup up more than 3 percent in one day. ExxonMobil and Boeing gained more than 2 percent, as did American Express and Travelers. The broader S&P 500 index, the Nasdaq Composite Index of mainly tech stocks, and the Russell 2000 index of smaller firms all closed at record levels. As Trump boasted in his speech, since his election victory last November 8, the Dow has soared nearly 3,000 points, as part of a stock market boom that has added an estimated $3 trillion in value to the shares of American banks and corporations. Wall Street had plenty to celebrate even before the speech in which Trump laid out his pro-corporate agenda. The first six weeks of the Trump administration have featured a series of executive orders loosening regulations on corporate polluters, particularly in the fossil fuel industries, and on banks, hedge funds and other swindlers whose operations led to the 2008 financial crash. Trump has reiterated his support for major tax cuts for US corporations and for wealthy individuals. He has also pledged a major increase in military spending that will benefit the giant defense contractors and an infrastructure program to funnel hundreds of billions into the coffers of private construction companies and manufacturers like Caterpillar. - Advertisement - These themes were spelled out in Trump's address to a joint session of Congress Tuesday night, to general enthusiasm from Republicans, near-universal praise from the media and significant backing from congressional Democrats. Trump also pledged to wage war against public education, intensify the brutal assault on immigrant workers, slash social programs and otherwise further redistribute wealth to the financial aristocracy. For the media, the consensus reaction to the speech appeared fully-formed within seconds of the end of the speech. On CNN, one of several outlets deliberately barred from a briefing at the White House by press secretary Sean Spicer last week, every panelist declared the speech at least a relative success. Van Jones, a former Obama White House aide and Bernie Sanders supporter, declared that Trump's crass exploitation of the death of Navy SEAL William Owens, in the closing section of his speech, was "one of the most extraordinary moments you have ever seen in American politics, period" and that it was the moment Trump "became president of the United States." This was only the most grotesque prostration before Trump on the part of the media. The Democratic response to Trump, both in the hall and afterwards, spoke volumes about the reactionary and politically bankrupt character of the so-called opposition party. Senator after senator applauded the speech: Bernie Sanders clapped for Trump's profession of economic nationalism; Tammie Baldwin cheered his reference to Harley-Davison motorcycles, built in her state; Debbie Stabenow applauded his support for the auto industry; Amy Klobuchar praised his pledge to reduce the cost of prescription drugs. Wall Street watched it all, and liked what it saw. The stock exchange has long known it can count on Senate Democratic Leader Charles Schumer -- the biggest single recipient of Wall Street campaign contributions. The newly cooperative "tone" struck by Trump, and responded to in kind by the Democrats, is of greatest importance to finance capital, since some of most important policy changes promised by Trump, especially tax cuts for business and the wealthy, require significant Democratic support. - Advertisement - Divisions remain within the ruling class, centered on foreign policy. In its editorial commenting on the speech, the New York Times, a mouthpiece for the Democratic Party, focused criticism on Trump's failure to spell out a policy "to deal with an increasingly aggressive Russia, which the Pentagon considers America's No. 1 threat, or China, which has become more assertive in the South China Sea." The newspaper brought up again what it called Trump's "murky ties to Russia" to explain what dominant sections of the military-intelligence apparatus consider to be an overly accommodative attitude toward Putin. Yet the dominant tone, including from the Times, was one of celebration of what unites the ruling class. The perspective of the financial aristocracy is that the twentieth century was one big mistake. Corporate America was compelled to make concessions to working people, because of fears provoked first by the Russian Revolution of 1917, then by the upsurge of the labor movement in the 1930s, and the extended struggles for civil rights and social gains in the 1960s. All this is to be taken back, in a rampage of reaction in which the watchword is that American corporations can do whatever they want. Whom the gods would destroy, they first make mad. The American financial aristocracy is gripped by the delusion that they can roll back history without paying any price, counting on the role of the Democratic Party, the trade unions, and other instruments for the disorganization and disorientation of the working class.

In the UAE, for instance, there is Emirates Engineering, Etihad Airways Engineering, and VD Gulf, a subsidiary of Russian MRO provider Volga-Dnepr Technics. VD Gulf has operated a six-bay hangar at Sharjah Airport since 2013, but with so much local competition it has to market globally to ensure a steady revenue stream. Last year the company expanded its EASA Part 145 certification to include base maintenance services for the Boeing 737NG and 747-400, and it has just secured Indian DGCA CAR 145 approval for maintenance and overhaul of 747-400, 737CL/NG and all Airbus A320 family aircraft. Its 22,000m2 hangar can accommodate six narrowbodies or two widebodies simultaneously. “Taking a step towards South Asian market is a new milestone not only for VD Gulf but for many Indian operators. Several Indian based operators have approached us for support and we can now fulfill their requirement,” said VD Gulf’s director, Mikhail Khoroshaev. Selling narrowbody maintenance to India is a smart move: Airbus forecasts demand for 1,230 single-aisle aircraft from the country over the next 20 years, while Boeing predicts 1,560 narrowbody sales over the same period. Both airframers estimate Indian traffic growth of around 8.5% per year through to 2035, by which time India should have become the third-largest aviation market in the world. In the meantime, Volga-Dnepr is also strengthening its home market: Volga-Dnepr Technics Moscow (VDTM) plans to increase headcount by more than a third this year and expand its line stations across Russia.

The rocket carried a classified satellite known as NROL-79 into space. Once in orbit, the spacecraft will be used to support national security missions. The United Launch Alliance partnered with the U.S. Air Force and other industry partners for the event. "I am so impressed by the incredible teamwork between the NRO, U.S. Air Force, our industry partners and the ULA team that resulted in today's successful launch," government satellite launch vice president Laura Maginnis said in a press release. ULA, a joint venture between Boeing and Lockheed Martin, supplied its Atlas V Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle, or EELV, for the launch. Additional advanced hardware was provided by Orbital ATK. "Seeing another successful Atlas V launch bolsters the pride we have in our partnership with ULA and confirms the trust they and the NRO place in us in delivering this critical asset for our nation's security," Orbital ATK Aerospace Structures vice president Steve Earl added. "Our highly engineered composite structures and control products, unwavering commitment and exceptional teamwork ensure dependable access to space and affordable innovation for our customers." The event marked ULA's second launch in 2017, and the company's 117th successful launch since the venture was founded in December 2006. Launch highlights!

Photo: Virgin Galactic Virgin Galactic may be best known for its space tourism ventures, but the organization is also aiming to become a dedicated satellite launch provider, as well. Today, the Virgin Group announced a new spinoff company that will be focused on launching satellites. Called Virgin Orbit, the new company will include the LauncherOne program, an initiative that involves launching small satellites from under the wing of a 747 airplane. Launching small satellites from under the wing of a 747 airplane Virgin is bringing in Dan Hart, the former vice president of government satellite systems at Boeing, to serve as the new president of Virgin Orbit. “The perfect next challenge is to lead Virgin Orbit’s entrepreneurial team through a transformative time for not only Virgin Orbit but also the industry,” Hart said in a statement. “To me, the Virgin brand is about making life on Earth better, and we are going to fulfill that purpose by accessing Low Earth Orbit (LEO) to connect billions of people and enabling valuable applications of data from space through Virgin Orbit’s flexible, affordable, and reliable launch service.” The new company means that the Virgin Group now has three companies dedicated to space travel and technologies. Virgin Galactic is still the group’s space tourism venture, focused on providing sub-orbital spaceflight experiences to paying customers. Currently, that company is testing out its SpaceShipTwo vehicle — a spaceplane that launches from a carrier aircraft — to make sure its ready to safely carry people to the edge of space. The Virgin Group’s other space subsidiary is The Spaceship Company, which designs and manufactures vehicles for Virgin Galactic. All three of these ventures are grouped together under a single portfolio, known as Galactic Ventures. LauncherOne in space during stage separation. Photo: Virgin Galactic Both Virgin Galactic and The Spaceship Company are headquartered in Mojave, California, but Virgin Orbit will operate out of Long Beach. There, Virgin Orbit’s 200 employees will work out of a 180,000-square-foot manufacturing facility to get the LauncherOne program ready for spaceflight. The program involves the development of two vehicles — the LauncherOne rocket that will send small satellites into orbit, and the 747-400 plane, called Cosmic Girl, that will serve as the “launchpad” for LauncherOne. Cosmic Girl is designed to carry LauncherOne, attached under its wing, up to 35,000 feet. At that altitude, the rocket will be released and fire its single main engine to zoom into space. Eventually the rocket will separate and a second upper stage engine will ignite, boosting the vehicle and its payload into orbit. A large list of satellites are already slated to launch on LauncherOne LauncherOne is designed to carry payloads weighing up to 660 pounds into lower Earth orbit. So far, a large list of satellites are already slated to launch on LauncherOne, including payloads for communications company OneWeb and even satellites for NASA. It’s not clear when commercial launches will begin, but Virgin Galactic’s CEO, George Whitesides, has said that test launches for the LauncherOne program could begin this year. He says the move to create Virgin Orbit was meant to signal a commitment to the purpose of LauncherOne. “What we really wanted to do was demonstrate that we had an entity that was focused on the needs of small satellites operators,” Whitesides tells The Verge. In 2015, Virgin acquired the 747 that’s become Cosmic Girl, and the company has been in the process of updating the vehicle for upcoming launches. Whitesides says those modifications should be finished in a couple months. The subsystems for the rocket are all well into advanced phases of testing too, and the engines that will be used in the rocket — called NewtonThree and NewtonFour — have undergone long-duration full-thrust tests. Virgin founder Richard Branson, George Whitesides, Dan Hart, and employees of Virgin Orbit pose on the company’s rocket engine test stands. Photo: Virgin Galactic Meanwhile, Virgin Galactic has recently begun tests of SpaceShipTwo, which debuted roughly a year ago. The spaceplane, called VSS Unity, effectively replaces Virgin Galactic’s first SpaceShipTwo vehicle, which was destroyed during a powered test flight in 2014. So far, VSS Unity has performed a few glide flights — during which the vehicle flies on its own without igniting its engine — but Virgin Galactic plans to ramp up testing over the next year.

Photograph: AFP/Indonesian presidential palace/Agus Suparto         You could call it bling diplomacy. As part of a month long tour in Asia to promote economic ties, King Salman of Saudi Arabia arrived in Indonesia on Wednesday to great fanfare, accompanied, the news media said, by a retinue with a net worth in the billions of dollars, including about 1,500 people, among them 25 high-ranking princes, 10 ministers and more than 100 security personnel. They arrived in six Boeing passenger jets and one Lockheed C-130 Hercules, a military transport aircraft carrying 460 tonnes of cargo, two Mercedes-Benz S600 limousines and two electric elevators for the king’s personal use. An Indonesian freight company told the Antara news agency that it employed 572 workers just to deal with the delegation’s luggage. The 81-year-old king used a golden-hued escalator to descend from a jet painted with the words “God Bless You.” Pageantry is hardly unusual for any royal family, even less so for the Saudis, who are famously extravagant spenders even as their citizens are struggling under a government austerity programme. Details about his entourage made headlines around the world, and appeared to overshadow the purpose of his trip. But the size and pomp of the king’s entourage may indicate efforts to strengthen trade ties with Asia at a time of falling oil prices, experts said: A demonstration of wealth can be a show of power. It involves “stroking egos and putting on a show: The Saudis are in town,” said Peter Salisbury, a research fellow at Chatham House in London. “When that number of people show up, it creates a stir. It’s symbolism.” There’s also an economic benefit to a visit by a delegation that is bigger and more opulent than average, Mr Salisbury said, as the visitors are likely to splurge on dinners, shopping, luxury villas in Bali and other extravagances. (“I wonder if King Salman and his 620-strong entourage will sample the delights of hedonistic Kuta?” a Twitter user asked, referring to a beach on Bali famous for its alcohol-drenched night life.) ADVERTISEMENT French chateaus The royal family’s fortunes are tied to vast reserves of petroleum and other assets estimated to total more than $1.4 trillion (€1.33 trillion). The sale of oil provides billions of dollars in annual allowances, public sector sinecures and perks for royals, the wealthiest of whom own French chateaus and Saudi palaces, stash money in Swiss bank accounts, wear couture dresses under their abayas and frolic on some of the world’s biggest yachts out of sight of commoners. In 2015, the king and his 1,000-person retinue closed off part of a beach on the French Riviera, provoking public outrage. Locals also complained that the Saudis had poured concrete directly onto the sand in an unauthorised attempt to instal an elevator. In 2014, the king infuriated tourists after booking three entire Maldive island resorts. (He also brought along a floating hospital.) Among his other royal perks, King Salman travels with roughly 100 bodyguards; the deck space on his yacht, moored in Marbella, Spain, is bigger than a football field. And despite his appetite for luxury, he maintains a private jail for “errant princes and spendthrift princesses who neglect to pay their bills,” according to Time Magazine. King Salman’s Asian trip, planned before US president Donald Trump’s election in November, began on Sunday in Malaysia. After Indonesia, where his stop was the first by a Saudi monarch in 46 years, he is expected to travel to Brunei, Japan, China and the Maldives. The visit is part of the king’s efforts to diversify the Saudi economy and lure Asian investors into buying a 5 per cent stake in Aramco, the state-owned oil company. The Indonesian government said it hoped to attract $25 billion in new investments from Saudi Arabia. The two governments agreed to a $6 billion joint venture between Aramco and its Indonesian counterpart, Pertamina. On Tuesday, Aramco signed a deal to invest $7 billion in a Malaysian oil company.

McIntyre By Michael K. McIntyre The Plain Dealer Email the author | Follow on Twitter on March 02, 2017 at 6:00 AM, updated March 02, 2017 at 10:26 AM comments I believe we explore and exploration really changes us. AKRON, Ohio -- The Trump administration wants NASA to fire up the thrusters on its space program. It has directed the agency to study the feasibility of adding astronauts to a mission to orbit the moon, planned for late next year. And the man in charge of that study is Akron native William Gerstenmaier, NASA's chief human flight administrator. NASA already had been planning a test flight for next year of its Orion spacecraft, launched with its massive new Space Launch System rocket. The plan for Exploration Mission-1, or EM-1, was to use  mannequins. Another mission, EM-2, which would include astronauts, was planned for 2021 if all went well. Now, the agency is studying the feasibility of putting astronauts on the original test flight and pushing the timetable on the technology that may one day help put a human on Mars. And Trump himself said in a joint address to Congress Tuesday, "American footprints on distant worlds are not too big a dream." Advisers to the president, including former U.S. Rep. Newt Gingrich, are pushing for an aggressive approach to space exploration. And that includes pressure from private-sector players. Big news on that front this week: Elon Musk's SpaceX has announced plans to fly two civilians - both paying customers -- around the moon next year aboard the Falcon Heavy rocket. Former Republican U.S. Rep. Robert Walker of Pennsylvania crafted the Trump administration's ambitious space plan and there has been extensive media coverage of the push within the administration to accelerate the space program, with private firms like Musk's and Jeff Bezos's Blue Origin pushing traditional NASA contractors like Boeing. It's being called "Old Space" vs. "New Space." For Gerstenmaier, who believes humans are meant to explore deep into the solar system, said politics and policy don't come into play for him "We'll be very careful about what we do," he told reporters during a recent media conference call. "We'll do the right thing." Gerstenmaier, 62, a 1973 graduate of East High School, says he aims to let data drive the decisions, despite the impression of some people that the Trump administration is pressuring NASA to be more aggressive. "From my perspective, there's not pressure to go do this. This is something we're going to evaluate and we'll trade it back and forth in the study and we'll see what the results look like coming out the other side," he said, adding that he doesn't have an opinion yet about the wisdom of adding humans to EM-1. "I've learned throughout my career that it's better if I don't have a preconceived decision about what the heck we really want to go do when I go into studies and actions," he said. "I'd rather let the data drive us and let the information push us in the direction that's right." His career has been a distinguished one, beginning in 1977, after he graduated from Purdue University with a degree in aeronautical engineering, when he signed on to work at Lewis Research Center, now known as NASA Glenn, in Cleveland. He did wind tunnel tests here related to the space shuttle. His father, Howard, was a technician at Firestone Tire & Rubber Co. and his mom, Evelyn, was an accountant. In 2010, he was awarded the Rotary Nataional for Space Achievement and was quoted in its publication saying he remembered standing outside his Akron home at the age of 3 watching the soviet satellite Sputnik fly overhead. "All of our neighbors were outside also. This impressed upon me that spaceflight was special," he said. "I believe we explore and exploration really changes us," he said during a talk last April at the Northeast Astonomy Forum in New York. In his college dorm room, he had a photo of earth taken from the Apollo 8 spacecraft that orbited the moon. "This really changed the way, I think, that we think of the earth. I wonder today with all the social media and all the pictures we get today, would this image have had the same effect as it did back in the '60s," he said. "This really showed that we are a fragile planet with a very thin atmosphere." William H. Gerstenmaier | The Need for Human Space Exploration: Preparing for Mars | NEAF Talks Gerstenmaier, who also has a master's degree in mechanical engineering from the University of Toledo, moved on to the Johnson Space Center in Houston in 1980 and has moved up the NASA ranks ever since. He has worked extensively with the International Space Station, the Russian Mir space station and the Space Shuttle program in his career. He became associate administrator for the Human Exploration and Operations Directorate at NASA Headquarters in Washington in 2005, a position he continues to hold. He was on business in Russia this week and unavailable for additional interviews. He noted in the media call that adding humans to the first test flight would increase costs and push back the timeline of EM-1 well into 2019. "Does this really advance significantly our overall ability to take humans routinely to the vicinity of the moon and operate safely? We'll actively trade these risks against the benefits," he said last week. In May, Gerstenmaier will receive the Space Pioneer Award from the National Space Society at its 2017 International Space Development Conference.  "The best of NASA's human spaceflight program is yet to come, and that is largely thanks to what Mr. Gerstenmaier and the spaceflight team have done to push the boundaries in space for humans," the Society noted in announcing the award this year.  Featured Columnists Mark Naymik Phillip Morris Kevin O'Brien About Us About Cleveland.com About Advance Ohio Advertise with us Audience FAQ Contact Us Career Opportunities Community FAQ Subscribe The Plain Dealer Sun News eNewsletters Subscriber Service Media Insider Rewards View My Profile Report a Delivery Issue Place a Vacation Hold Make a Payment Cleveland.com Sections News Sports High School Sports Entertainment Living Politics Opinion Obituaries Jobs Autos Real Estate Rentals Classifieds Shopping Deals and Coupons Local Businesses Deals in Your Area Your Regional News Pages Beachwood Brunswick Lakewood Parma & Parma Heights Strongsville More Communities Mobile Mobile Apps More on Cleveland.com Videos Photos Interact with us Weather Post a job Post a classified ad Sell your car Sell/rent your home Sitemap & search Sponsor Content Follow Us Twitter | Facebook | Google+ | Instagram | Pinterest Registration on or use of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy © 2017 Advance Ohio All rights reserved (About Us).

Newly installed Chief Executive David Lockwood, who joined in December, said changes are already being made to streamline decision making, though the turnaround program would require about two years. "A lot of our get-well emphasis will be on 2017," he said in an interview. Cobham has been pummeled by a series of problems executing key programs and by weakness in major markets. The company last month announced a series of charges it would take against earnings, including a GBP150 million hit on the KC-46A military refueling plane Boeing Co. BA, -0.69% is building for the U.S. Air Force. A slump in commodity prices has weighed on aviation services it operates in Australia. Cobham's management team, which includes a new chairman and chief financial officer after a sweeping shakeup at the company last year, will also review a portfolio that has expanded through acquisitions which have failed to deliver anticipated returns. The company needs to be simpler, Mr. Lockwood said, though signaled some of the issues could be addressed through restructuring. "I don't think diversity is necessarily a weakness, it's just when diversity is out of control it becomes a weakness." Mr. Lockwood said Cobham is targeting a reduction of leverage to 1.5 times net debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization from three-times at the end of 2016. That will be achieved through the rights issue, due to be completed in the second quarter, along with internal measures and could include disposals, he said. The widely expected rights issue is the second in less than a year. Cobham shares traded 3.11% higher at GBP1.26 in London. Cobham is poised to benefit from improving defense spending environment in the U.S. and U.K. U.S. President Donald Trump has promised a hike in military spending. Mr. Lockwood said that won't lessen the urgency to fix internal problems, since the benefits from higher budgets may take some time to flow through to the bottom line. Adjusted operating profit for the year ended Dec. 31, 2016, fell to GBP225 million from GBP332 million a year earlier. In February, Cobham said underlying operating profit would total GBP225 million for 2016, down from previous estimates of between GBP255 million and GBP275 million, due to additional costs and charges. Its full-year reported loss before tax was GBP847.9 million, compared with a pretax loss of GBP39.8 million in 2015, while revenue slipped to GBP1.94 billion from GBP2.07 billion. Cobham suspended its 2016 dividend and said it had no plans to pay one in 2017. Mr. Lockwood said it was too early to say when dividend payments would resume. -Write to Robert Wall at robert.wall@wsj.com More from MarketWatch The 10 most expensive places to raise a family in the U.S. Stop Unwanted Spam Text Messages Drowning in Charging Cables?

The Atlas 5 rocket lifted off at 9:49am on Wednesday, and roared away into a clear sky over Vandenberg Air Force Base. All systems were going well when the launch webcast concluded about five minutes into the flight, as is customary during such missions. Scroll down for video  An Atlas 5 rocket carrying the NROL-79 mission is launched at the Vandenberg Air Force Base, California on Wednesday, March 1, 2017 WHAT IS THE NRO? The National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) is the US Government agency in charge of designing, building and launching America's intelligence satellites.  It was created in 1961 and was then declassified to the public in 1992.  They provide reconnaissance support to the Intelligence Community (IC) and the Department of Defense (DoD).  The satellite, dubbed NROL-79, is described only as a national security payload for the NRO. The once-secret office operates an array of intelligence-gathering satellites. The launch was conducted by United Launch Alliance, a joint venture of Lockheed Martin and Boeing, and the Air Force's 30th Space Wing. Consuming rocket grade kerosene (RP-1) and liquid oxygen, the Atlas 5 rocket produced about 860,000 pounds (3,827 kilonewtons) of thrust.  As the vehicle climbed out of Earth’s atmosphere and into the vacuum of space this increased to 933,000 pounds (4,152 kilonewtons). After 1 minute and 21 seconds the vehicle surpassed the speed of sound, according to Space Flight Insider.  RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Revealed: The EARLIEST life on Earth. 3.8billion-year-old...

Fearless Muckraking Since 1993 Home Articles Recent Articles Magazine Current Issue Back Issues Subscribe Subscriber Access Subscribe Donate Archives Search Authors About JOIN LIST Books T-shirts podcasts FAQs March 2, 2017 Trump in Historical Perspective: From Nixon to Breitbart by Jack Rasmus by Tweet Email Photo by Brianna Privett | CC BY 2.0 Trump is not a new phenomenon.  He is the latest, and most aggressive to date, repacking of corporate-radical right attempts to reassert corporate hegemony and control over the global economy and US society.  His antecedents are the policies and strategies of Nixon, Reagan and Gingrich’s ‘Contract for America’ in the 1990s. Trump has of course added his ‘new elements’ to the mix.  He’s integrated the Teaparty elements left over from their purged by Republican Party elites after the 2012 national elections.  He’s unified some of the more aggressive elements of the finance capital elites from hedge funds, commercial real estate, private equity, securities speculators and their ilk—i.e. the Adelsons, Singers, Mercers, and Schwarzman’s.  He’s captured, for the moment at least, important elements of the white industrial working class in the Midwest and South, co-opted union leaders from the building trades, and even neutralized top union leaders in some manufacturing industries.  He’s firmly united the gun lobby of the NRA and the religious right now with the Breitbart propaganda machine and the so-called ‘Alt-Right’ fringe. Trump is a political and economic reaction to the crisis in the US economy in the 21st century, which the Obama administration could not effectively address after the 2008-09 crash. Trump shares this historical role with Nixon, who was a response to another decline in US corporate-economic political power in the early 1970s; with Reagan who was a response to the economic stagnation of the late 1970s; and with the ‘Contract for America’, a program associated with a takeover of Congress by the radical right in 1994.  All these antecedents find their expression in the Trump movement and the policy and program positions that are now taking form under the Trump regime. American economic and political elites are not reluctant to either change the rules of the game in their favor whenever warranted to ensure their hegemony, targeting not only foreign capitalist competitors when their influence grows too large but also potential domestic opposition by workers and unions, minorities, and even liberals who try to step out of their role as junior partners in rule.  This restructuring of rule has occurred not only in the early 1970s, early 1980s, mid 1990s, and now post Obama—a regime that failed to contain both foreign competition and domestic restlessness.  US elites did it on an even grander scale in 1944-47, and before that again during the decade of the first world war. What’s noteworthy of the current, latest restructuring is its even greater nastiness and aggressiveness compared to earlier similar efforts to restore control. Trump’s policies and strategies reflect new elements in the policy and politics mix.  He’s rearranged the corporate-right wing base—bringing in new forces and challenging others to go along or get out.  But Trump’s fundamental policies and strategy share a clear continuity with past restructurings introduced before him by Nixon and Reagan in the early 1970s and 1980s, respectively. Nixon-Trump Like his predecessors, Trump arose in response to major foreign capitalist and domestic popular challenges to the Neoliberal corporate agenda.   Nixon may have come to office on the wave of splits and disarray in the Democratic party over Vietnam in 1968 but he was clearly financed and promoted by big corporate elements convinced that a more aggressive response to global economic challenges by Europe and domestic protest movements were required.  European capitalists were becoming increasingly competitive with American, both in Europe and in the US.  The dollar was over-valued and US exports were losing ground. And middle east elites were nationalizing their oil fields.  Domestically, American workers and unions launched the second biggest strike wave in US history in 1969-71, winning contract settlements 20%-25% increases in wages and benefits.  Mass social movements led by environmentalists, women, and minorities were expanding.  Social legislation like job safety and health laws were being passed. + Nixon’s response was to counterattack foreign competitors by launching his ‘New Economic Program’ (NEP) in 1971.  Not unlike Trump today, the primary focus of NEP was to improve the competitiveness of US corporations in world markets. + To this effect the US dollar was devalued as the US intentionally imploded the post-1945 Bretton Woods international monetary system. Trump wants to force foreign competitors to raise the value of their currencies, in effect achieving a dollar devaluation simply by another means. The means may be different, but the goal is the same. + Nixon imposed a 10% import tax, not unlike Trump’s proposed 20% border tax today. + Nixon proposed subsidies and tax cuts for US auto companies and other manufacturers; Trump has been promising Ford, Carrier Corp., Boeing and others the same, in exchange for token statements they’ll reduce (not stop or reverse) offshoring of jobs. + Nixon introduced a 7% investment tax credit for businesses without verification that he claimed would stimulate business spending in the US; Trump is going beyond, adding multi-trillion dollar tax cuts for business and investors, while saying more tax cuts for businesses and investors is needed to create jobs, even though historically there’s no empirical evidence whatsoever for the claim. + Nixon froze union wages and then rolled back their 1969-71 20% contract gains to 5.5%; Trump attacks unions by encourage state level ‘right to work’ business legislation that will outlaw workers requiring to join unions or pay dues. + Nixon accelerated defense spending while refusing to spend money on social programs by ‘impounding’ the funds authorized by Congress; Trump has just announced an historic record 9% increase in defense spending, while proposing to gut spending on education, health, and social programs by the same 9% amount. + Nixon’s economic policies screwed up the US economy, leading to the worst inflation and worst recession since the great depression; So too will Trump’s. Similarities between Nixon and Trump abound in the political realm as well. + Nixon fought and railed against the media; so now too is Trump. The only difference was one used a telephone and the other his iphone. + Nixon declared he had a mandate, and the ‘silent majority’ of middle America was behind him; Trump claims his ‘forgotten man’ of middle America put him in office. + Nixon bragged construction worker ‘hard hats’ backed him, as he encouraged construction companies to form their ‘anti-union construction roundtable’ group; Trump welcomes construction union leaders to the White House while he supports reducing ‘prevailing wage’ for construction work. + Nixon continually promoted ‘law and order’ and attempted to repress social movements and protests by means of the Cointelpro program FBI-CIA spying on citizens, while developing plans for rollout in his second term to intensify repression of protestors and social movements; Trump tweets police can do no wrong (whom he loves second only to his generals)and calls for new investigations of protestors, mandatory jail sentences for protestors, and encourages governors to propose repressive legislation to limit exercise of First Amendment rights of free assembly. + Trump’s also calling for an investigation of election voting fraud, which will serve as cover to propose even more State level limits on voters rights. + Nixon undertook a major shift in US foreign policy, establishing relations with Communist China—a move designed to split the Soviet Union (Russia) further from China; Trump is just flipping Nixon’s strategy around, trying to establish better relations with Russia as a preliminary to intensifying attacks on China. + Anticipating defeat in Southeast Asia, Nixon declared victory and walked away from Vietnam; Trump will do the same in Syria, Iraq and the Middle East. + The now infamous ‘Powell Memorandum’ was written on Nixon’s watch—a plan for corporate America to launch an aggressive economic and social offensive to restore its greater hegemony over US society; an equivalent Trump ‘Bannon Memorandum’ strategic plan for the same will no doubt eventually be made public after the fact as well Nixon was a crook; so will be Trump branded, but not until they release his taxes and identify payments (emoluments) received by his global businesses from foreign governments and security services. Reagan-Trump The parallels in economic policy and political strategy are too many and too similar to consider merely coincidental.  Nixon is Trump’s policy and strategy mentor. Similar comparisons can be made between Trump and Reagan, given a different twist here, a change in emphasis there. + Reagan introduced a major increase in defense spending, including a 600 ship navy, more missiles and nuclear warheads, and a military front in space called ‘star wars’; Trump loves generals and promises them his record 9% increase in war spending as well, paid for by equal cuts in social programs. + Reagan introduced a $700 billion plus tax cut for business and investors, and an even more generous investment tax credit and accelerated depreciation allowances (tax cuts); Trump promises to cut business tax rates by half, end all taxes on their offshore profits, end all inheritance taxes, keep investor offshore tax loopholes, etc.—more than $1 trillion worth– while eliminating wage earners’ tax credits. + Reagan cut social spending by tens of billions; Trump has proposed even more tens of billions. + Reagan promised to balance the US budget but gave us accelerating annual budget deficits, fueled by record defense spending and the tax cuts for business of more than $700 billion (on a GDP of $4 trillion), the largest cuts in US history up to that time; Trump’s budget deficit from $1 trillion in business tax cuts and war spending escalation will make Reagan’s pale in comparison. + Reagan’s trade policy to reverse deteriorating US trade with Japan and Europe, was to directly attack Japan and Europe ( 1985 Plaza Accord and Louvre Accord trade agreements), forcing Japan-Europe to over-stimulate their economies and inflate their prices to give US companies an export cost competitive advantage; Trump’s policy simply changes the target countries to Mexico, Germany and China. Each will have its very own ‘Accord’ deal with Trump-US. + The first free trade NAFTA deal with Canada was signed on Reagan’s watch; Trump only wants to ‘rearrange the deck chairs’ on the free trade ‘Titanic’ and replace multilateral free trade with bilateral deals he negotiates and can claim personal credit for. + Reagan encouraged speculators to gut workers’ pension plans and he shifted the burden of social security taxation onto workers to create a ‘social security trust fund’ surplus the government could then steal; Trump promises not to propose cutting social security, but refuses to say if the Republicans in Congress attach cuts to other legislation he’ll veto it. + Reagan deregulated banks, airlines, utilities, trucking and other businesses, which led to financial crises in the late 1980s and the 1990-91 recession; Trump has championed repeal of the even token 2010 Dodd-Frank bank regulation act, and has deregulated by executive order even more than Reagan or Nixon. + Stock market, junk bond market, and housing markets crashed in the wake of Reagan’s financial deregulation initiatives; the so-called ‘Trump Trade’ since the election have escalated stock and junk bond valuations to bubble heights. + Reagan bragged of his working class Republican supporters, and busted unions like the Air Traffic Controllers, while encouraging legal attacks on union and worker rights; Trump has his ‘forgotten man’, and courts union leaders in the White House while encouraging states to push ‘right to work’ laws that prohibited requiring workers to join unions or pay dues. + Reagan replaced his chair of the Federal Reserve Bank, Paul Volcker, when he wouldn’t go along with Reagan-James Baker (Treasury Secretary) plans on reducing interest rates; Trump will replace current chair, Janet Yellen, when her term as chair expires next year Then there are the emerging political parallels between Reagan and Trump as well: + Even before the 1980 national election was even held, Reagan’s future staff members met secretly with foreign government of Iran to request they not release the 300 American hostages there before the 1980 election; Trump staff (i.e. General Flynn), apparently after the election, met with Russian representatives to discuss relations before confirmed by Congress. Reagan’s boys got off; Flynn didn’t. Events are similar, though outcomes different. + Reagan attacked the liberal media. Much less aggressively perhaps than Trump today, but nevertheless the once liberal-progressive Public Broadcasting Company was chastised, under threat by the government of budget cuts or outright privatization. It responded by inviting fewer left of center guest opinions to the show. So too thereafter did mainstream television Sunday talk shows (‘Meet the Press’, etc.); Trump’s attack on the media is more aggressive, aiming not to tame the media but de-legitimize it. + Reagan staff directly violated Congressional laws by arranging drug money seizures from Latin America by the CIA to pay for Iranian arms bought for the US by Israel, that were then distributed to the ‘contras’ in Nicaragua to launch a civil war against their duly elected left government. Nixon had his ‘Watergate’, Reagan his ‘Irangate’. Next ‘gate’ will be Trump’s. + Reagan’s offensive against the environment was notorious, including appointments of cabinet members who declared publicly their intent to dismantle the department and gutting the EPA budget; Trump’s appointments and budget slashing now follow the same path. + If Nixon’s policy was court China-challenge Russia, Reagan’s was court Russia-isolate China; Trump’s policy is to return to a Nixonian court Russia-confront China. The corporate-radical right alliance continued after Reagan, re-emerging once again in the 1994 so-called ‘Contract With America’, as Clinton’s Democrats lost 54 seats in the US House of Representatives to the Republican right after backtracking on notable Democrat campaign promises made in the 1992 elections.   The landslide was a harbinger of things to come in a later Obama administration in 2010. The Contract for America proposed a program that shares similar policies with the Trump administration. It was basically a plagiarism of a Reagan 1985 speech. But it provided program continuity through the 1990s, re-emerging in a more aggressive grass roots form in the Teaparty movement in 2008. Trump as the ‘Breitbartification’ of Nixon-Reagan Trump is more than just Nixon-Reagan on steroids.  Trump is taking the content and the tone of the conservative-radical right to a more aggressive level. The aggressiveness and new elements added to the radical right conservative perspective in the case of Trump are the consequence of adding a Breitbart-Steve Bannon strategic (and even tactical) overlay to the basic Nixon-Reagan programmatic foundation. The influence of Bannon on Trump strategy, programs, policy and even tactics cannot be underestimated.  This is the new key element, missing with Nixon, Reagan, the Contract with America, and the Teaparty.  The Breitbart strategy is to introduce a major dose of ‘economic nationalism’, heretofore missing in the radical right. The appearance of opposition to free trade, protectionism, reshoring of jobs, cuts in foreign aid, direct publicity attacks on Mexico, China, Germany and even Australia are all expressions.  Another element of Bannonism is to identify as ‘the enemy’ the neoliberal institutions—the media and mainstream press, the elites running the two parties, and even the Judiciary whenever it stands up to Trump policies. Added to the ‘enemy’ is the ‘danger within’, which is the foreigner, the immigrant, both inside and outside the country.  The immigrant is the ‘new jew’ potential in the Trump regime. This too comes from Breitbart-Bannon.  Another strategic element brought by Bannon to the Trump table is the expanded hiring and tightening of ties to various police organizations nationwide and the glorification of the police while denigrating anyone who stands up to them. Another element is to attack the character of democracy itself, raising issues of fraud in voting, and undermining popular understanding of what constitutes the right to assembly and free speech. Even the military is not exempt from the Bannon-Breitbart strategy:  high level military and defense establishment figures who haven’t wholeheartedly come over to the Trump regime are replaced with non-conformist and opportunist generals from the military establishment. Bannon-Breitbart is the conduit to the various grass roots right wing radical elements, that will be organized and mobilized if necessary, should the old elites, media and their supporters choose to challenge Trump directly with impeachment or other ‘nuclear’ options. Nixon and Reagan both restructured the political and economic US capitalist system. But they did so within the rules of the game within that system.  Trump differs by attacking the rules of the game, and the established elites and their institutions, while offering those same elites the opportunity for great economic personal gain if they go along.  Some are, and some still aren’t. The ‘showdown’ is yet to come, and not until 2018 at the earliest. Trump should be viewed as a continuation of the corporate-radical right alliance that has been growing in the US since the 1970s. The difference today is that that alliance is firmly entrenched at all levels and in all institutions now, unlike in the past, and inside as well as outside the government.  And the opposition to it today is far weaker than in the 1970s, 80s, or 90s: the Democratic Party has virtually collapsed outside Washington DC as it continues myopically on its neoliberal path with its recent selection of Perez as national chair by the Clinton-Obama-Big Donor wing still firmly in control of that party; the unions are but a shadow of their past selves and split, with some actually supporting Trump; the so-called liberal press has been thoroughly corporatized and shows it has no idea how to confront the challenge, feeding the Trump movement instead of weakening it; grass root minority, ethnic, and progressive movements are fragmented and isolated from each other unlike never before, locked into their mutually isolated identity politics protests; and what was once the ‘far left’ of socialists have virtually disappeared organizationally, condemning the growing millions of youth who express a favorable view of socialism to have to learn the lessons of political organizing from scratch all over again. But they will learn. Trump and friends will teach them. Join the debate on Facebook Jack Rasmus is the author of  ‘Systemic Fragility in the Global Economy’, Clarity Press, 2015.

After its IPO in November 2013, Twitter realized the power of the feeds it generates for financial purposes and moved data distribution in-house to leverage its own data. (Emmanuel Dunan/AFP/Getty Images) Investors and stock traders are paying close attention to President Donald Trump’s Twitter account for good reason: His tweets can move markets. They can even use computer algorithms to capture these tweets and make more money. Defense contractor Lockheed Martin’s stock took a hit in December last year, losing nearly $4 billion in market value, shortly after Trump criticized the company’s F-35 contract on Twitter. Companies including Boeing, General Motors, and Ford were also recent victims of Trump’s tweets. Trump prefers Twitter to other media, as he gets his messages out more efficiently and honestly, he says. Fund managers have been using Twitter data for yea rs to make investment decisions. According to a recent study published by NPR for example, 25 percent of institutional investors said they use social media for research. Fortunately, investors themselves do not have to monitor 500 million tweets posted daily. They can rely on advanced machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques to analyze millions of messages. Data Mining Among social media platforms, Twitter is by far the largest source of data, according to Valerie Bogard, an equities research analyst at Tabb Group, a capital markets consulting firm. With growing demand, the number of companies that mine and analyze social media data, like Dataminr and TickerTags, has exploded in recent years. “Traders have been using Twitter since its launch [in 2006],” but gained more traction in 2013, said Bogard. In that year, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved a rule allowing companies to use social media sites like Twitter and Facebook to disclose corporate news. Then, the Associated Press (AP) Twitter account was hacked, resulting in a false tweet that said two explosions in the White House had injured President Barack Obama. The event, known as “hash crash,” sparked a selloff in U.S. stocks and showed how fast a tweet could move the markets.  Such events changed the way investors viewed social data, said Bogard. Alternative data can be used in sentiment analysis. It can identify the market’s opinion on a particular product, a stock, or the mood of traders. It can also be used to detect events like breaking news that move the markets as well as long-term trends, ideas, or cultural movements important for certain stocks. * “Having alternative data does not guarantee that you are going to make money. But not having alternative data almost guarantees that you are going to lose money, because investing is highly competitive. It is like an arms race,” said Gene Ekster, who advises hedge funds on alternative data strategies. Twitter is only one component of so-called alternative data or non-traditional data. Hedge funds also use other alternative data like satellite imagery and public website data to make investment decisions. People think only quantitative funds use alternative data, but this is not true, according to Ekster. Fundamental long-short investors above a billion dollars in assets under management are using the non-traditional data sets to make their investment decisions, he said. Depending on the dataset, funds can pay anywhere between $50,000 and $3 million per year, Ekster said. Shortcomings of Twitter Data For traders, having an information edge is critical. However, there are some challenges in using Twitter as a data source. The White House “hash crash” incident, for example, was a costly lesson for some investors who traded on that fake news. The S&P 500 index briefly lost $136.5 billion in value before it bounced back, according to Reuters. Another example was the Lululemon Athletica case, said Ekster. Shares of Lululemon Athletica Inc. (ticker symbol: LULU) fell sharply in March 2013, after the athletic apparel retailer said it would recall pants that were too transparent. Following the news, many people on Twitter made jokes about the see-through pants. Related Coverage Young Entrepreneur Battles ‘Fast Fashion’ With the 30-Year Sweatshirt “They were very sarcastic when talking about Lululemon. They were using smiley faces and words that made tweets seem like positive news,” Ekster said. The automated learning tools interpreted this as positive news and created a strong buy signal for the company’s stock. And some investors lost money because of that. “The problem is that a computer is not good at dealing with sarcasm. … Their algorithms were not picking up on the sarcastic remarks,” Ekster said. Such incidents are less frequent but they do happen. Hedge funds are constantly improving their data filters to avoid trading on fake news alarms and to gain an edge over their competition.   Editor’s Picks Neuromarketing in the Age of iPhones How Communism Stifles Innovation Sanctuary Policies Shield Convicted Criminals From Feds Receive Our Epoch 10 Newsletter Important stories from around the world, in your inbox daily.

Cory Gardner (6 letters) By Justin Sink, Andrew Mayeda and Josh Wingrove, Bloomberg The Keystone XL pipeline won’t be required to use American-made steel to earn construction approval from the Trump administration, the White House said Friday, despite President Donald Trump’s repeated claims. The president’s executive order mandating the use of U.S. steel is “specific to new pipelines or those that are being repaired,” White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders told reporters aboard Air Force One on Friday. “Since this one is already current, under construction, the steel is already literally sitting there, it would be hard to go back,” she said. That’s welcome news to TransCanada Corp. as its moves forward with the $8 billion project. The pipeline would span 1,179 miles (1,897 kilometers) from Alberta through three states — Montana, South Dakota, and Nebraska — before connecting to an existing network feeding crude to U.S. Gulf Coast refineries. The line would carry as much as 830,000 barrels of oil a day, including some from North Dakota’s Bakken shale. In 2012, the company said it expected half of the 821,000 tons of steel needed to construct the pipeline to be produced inside of the United States. The remainder of the steel was expected to be imported from Canada, Italy, and India. But exempting Keystone XL from the president’s requirement to use American steel would seem to fly in the face of Trump’s public comments. Trump has repeatedly boasted that he forced pipeline companies to agree to use U.S. steel in their projects. During a Feb. 23 meeting with manufacturing CEOs at the White House, Trump told U.S. Steel Corp chief executive Mario Longhi that “the pipe is coming from the U.S.” for the Keystone project, as well as Energy Transfer Partners’s Dakota Access pipeline. “We put you heavy into the pipeline business because we approved, as you know, the Keystone Pipeline and Dakota,” Trump told Longhi. “But they have to buy — meaning, steel, so I’ll say U.S. Steel — but steel made in this country and pipelines made in this country.” During a Feb. 16 press conference, the president said that in exchange for using “the powers of government to make that pipeline happen” the administration “want them to use American steel.” “And they’re willing to do that, but nobody ever asked before I came along,” he said. “Even this order was drawn and they didn’t say that. And I’m reading the order, I’m saying, why aren’t we using American steel? And they said, that’s a good idea. We put it in.” He repeated the claim a day later during a tour of a Boeing Co. plant in South Carolina. “You probably saw the Keystone pipeline I approved recently, and the Dakota,” Trump said. “And I’m getting ready to sign the bill. I said, where is the pipe made? And they told me not here. I said, that’s good — add a little sentence that you have to buy American steel. And you know what? That’s the way it is. It’s the way it’s going to be.” Related Articles June 28, 2016 TransCanada seeks $15 billion for rejection of Keystone pipeline March 3, 2015 In light of oil train wrecks, wouldn’t Keystone pipeline be safer? February 11, 2015 Congress sends Keystone pipeline bill to Obama, setting up veto January 29, 2015 Senate passage of Keystone pipeline bill sets up showdown with Obama Trump told a similar story later that weekend at a Feb. 18 rally in Melbourne, Florida. Noting that he had had moved to “begin the construction” of the Keystone and Dakota projects, Trump said that as he was about to sign the order, he asked who would be manufacturing the pipe. “Something this audience understands very well, right?” Trump said. “Simple question. The lawyers put this very complex document in front. I said, who makes the pipe? They said, sir, it can be made anywhere. I said, not anymore. So I put a little clause on the bottom: The pipe has to be made in the United States of America if we’re going to have pipelines.” A White House official who would only discuss the pipeline issue on the condition of anonymity said the Commerce Department was working on a plan for the president’s order requiring U.S. steel, so the administration couldn’t implement it until that effort had completed. Moreover, the official said, because the Keystone XL pipeline is currently under construction it does not count as a new, retrofitted, repaired, or expanded pipeline. Asked about the issue, TransCanada issued a statement saying it continued “to be encouraged as our Presidential Permit application makes its way through the approval process.” “This project will support U.S. energy security, create thousands of well-paying U.S. jobs and provide substantial economic benefits,” the company said. Canada’s U.S. ambassador, David MacNaughton, said Friday in an interview that negotiations on Keystone’s route are going “extremely well” with federal authorities and “I don’t see any big hurdles” from the Trump administration. He called the outlook for the project “very positive.” Tags:  Donald Trump Keystone XL pipeline Click for Digital & Home Delivery - 50% blog comments powered by Disqus More in Trump Administration Small Florida airport will remain closed during Trump visits March 06, 2017, 11:18 pm The businesses at a small Florida airport that the Secret Service orders closed each time President Donald Trump visits his Mar-a-Lago resort won’t get any concessions.

(AP Photo/Evan Vucci) comments WASHINGTON — The Keystone XL pipeline won’t be required to use American-made steel to earn construction approval from the Trump administration, the White House said Friday, despite President Donald Trump’s repeated claims. The president’s executive order mandating the use of U.S. steel is “specific to new pipelines or those that are being repaired,” White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders told reporters aboard Air Force One on Friday. “Since this one is already current, under construction, the steel is already literally sitting there, it would be hard to go back,” she said. That’s welcome news to TransCanada Corp. as its moves forward with the $8 billion project. The pipeline would span 1,179 miles (1,897 kilometers) from Alberta through three states — Montana, South Dakota, and Nebraska — before connecting to an existing network feeding crude to U.S. Gulf Coast refineries. The line would carry as much as 830,000 barrels of oil a day, including some from North Dakota’s Bakken shale. In 2012, the company said it expected half of the 821,000 tons of steel needed to construct the pipeline to be produced inside of the United States. The remainder of the steel was expected to be imported from Canada, Italy, and India. But exempting Keystone XL from the president’s requirement to use American steel would seem to fly in the face of Trump’s public comments. Trump has repeatedly boasted that he forced pipeline companies to agree to use U.S. steel in their projects. During a Feb. 23 meeting with manufacturing CEOs at the White House, Trump told U.S. Steel Corp chief executive Mario Longhi that “the pipe is coming from the U.S.” for the Keystone project, as well as Energy Transfer Partners LP’s Dakota Access pipeline. “We put you heavy into the pipeline business because we approved, as you know, the Keystone Pipeline and Dakota,” Trump told Longhi. “But they have to buy — meaning, steel, so I’ll say U.S. Steel — but steel made in this country and pipelines made in this country.” During a Feb. 16 news conference, the president said that in exchange for using “the powers of government to make that pipeline happen,” the administration “want them to use American steel.” “And they’re willing to do that, but nobody ever asked before I came along,” he said. “Even this order was drawn and they didn’t say that. And I’m reading the order, I’m saying, why aren’t we using American steel? And they said, that’s a good idea. We put it in.” He repeated the claim a day later during a tour of a Boeing Co. plant in South Carolina. “You probably saw the Keystone pipeline I approved recently, and the Dakota,” Trump said. “And I’m getting ready to sign the bill. I said, where is the pipe made? And they told me not here. I said, that’s good — add a little sentence that you have to buy American steel. And you know what? That’s the way it is. It’s the way it’s going to be.” Trump told a similar story later that weekend at a Feb. 18 rally in Melbourne, Fla. Noting that he had had moved to “begin the construction” of the Keystone and Dakota projects, Trump said that as he was about to sign the order, he asked who would be manufacturing the pipe. “Something this audience understands very well, right?” Trump said. “Simple question. The lawyers put this very complex document in front. I said, who makes the pipe? They said, sir, it can be made anywhere. I said, not anymore. So I put a little clause on the bottom: The pipe has to be made in the United States of America if we’re going to have pipelines.” A White House official who would only discuss the pipeline issue on the condition of anonymity said the Commerce Department was working on a plan for the president’s order requiring U.S. steel, so the administration couldn’t implement it until that effort had completed. Moreover, the official said, because the Keystone XL pipeline is currently under construction it does not count as a new, retrofitted, repaired, or expanded pipeline. Asked about the issue, TransCanada issued a statement saying it continued “to be encouraged as our Presidential Permit application makes its way through the approval process.” “This project will support U.S. energy security, create thousands of well-paying U.S. jobs and provide substantial economic benefits,” the company said. Canada’s U.S. ambassador, David MacNaughton, said Friday in an interview that negotiations on Keystone’s route are going “extremely well” with federal authorities and “I don’t see any big hurdles” from the Trump administration. He called the outlook for the project “very positive.” ——— (Andrew Mayeda and Josh Wingrove contributed to this report.) ——— ©2017 Bloomberg News Visit Bloomberg News at www.bloomberg.com Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC. _____   More On: Energy Transfer Partners LP United States Steel Corp Donald Trump Mario Barrett Mario Longhi Share this Article Join the Conversation Herald Columnists Joyce Ferriabough Bolling Bolling: Great equalizer helped to build a better boston Peter Gelzinis Gelzinis: Six weeks in and Donald Trump’s looking tapped out Kimberly Atkins Atkins: Cuba fears prez could wipe out island’s gains Jaclyn Cashman Cashman: Belle’s beastly brouhaha Bob McGovern McGovern: A footnote won’t pull in the big fish Adriana Cohen Cohen: Jihadi threat makes order common sense Trending Now Shattuck: For Obama, spying is nothing new | Boston Herald Chance the Rapper writes $1 million check to Chicago Public Schools as a ‘call to action’ Ben Carson refers to slaves as 'immigrants who came here in the bottom of slave ships' Film spotlighting human trafficking to get Belmont debut Tweets by @bostonherald Boston Herald News Local Coverage Local Politics Columnists National US Politics International Offbeat News Obituaries Opinion Op Ed Letters to the Editor Editorials Send a Letter Sports Red Sox Patriots Celtics Bruins Columnist College Soccer Golf High School Other Entertainment Inside Track Celebrity News Arts & Culture Movies Music Television LifeStyle Food & Beverage Style & Fashion Travel Health & Fitness Business Automotive Real Estate Technology Markets More… Classifieds Radio Horoscope Lottery Crossword Contests Weather RSS Feeds Archives Log In Legal Notices Advertise Purchase Back Copies Send a News Tip Contact Us Home Delivery e-Edition Mobile Apps Herald Newsletters Send a Letter to the Editor Boston Herald In Education Mass Literacy ©Copyright by the Boston Herald and Herald Media No portion of BostonHerald.com or its content may be reproduced without the owner's written permission.

The US Air Force’s Updated E-3G Radar Planes Are Vulnerable to Hacks Ironically, the downside to having modern computers in planes lies in their susceptibility to that most contemporary of threats—hacking. The E-3 Sentry airborne early warning and control aircraft, or AWACS, is a linchpin of United States air power. With its powerful radar and communication systems, the E-3 can patrol vast swaths of territory for aerial and maritime adversaries, and direct friendly forces to respond. However, like a lot of older military hardware, the Sentry's 1970s and 80s-era electronics lack many capabilities we take for granted in modern computers. So it makes sense that the Air Force has been working to upgrade its AWACS fleet to the new E-3G Block 40/45 variant with modern open architecture computers that can be updated on the fly. The Air Force has already refitted nine E-3s to the new standard. However, plans to upgrade 18 more have been delayed after the Block 40/45 dramatically flunked a series of performance tests in 2016. Ironically, the downside to having modern computers lies in their vulnerability to that most contemporary of threats — hacking. Read more: The US Air Force's Biggest Spy Planes Are Hunting ISIS Fighters The E-3 Sentry was first deployed in 1977, replacing the older EC-121 Warning Star which served in Vietnam. Basically a 707 airliner with a nine-meter diameter APY- 2 radar rotating on top, the E-3's 13 to 19 crew members can track aircraft and ships from as far as 250 miles away. The Sentry is particularly useful for detecting aircraft flying below the effective altitude of surface-based radars. The E-3's 20 high- and ultra-high frequency radios allow the crew to communicate with and direct friendly forces. Today the US Air Force operates a fleet of 32 E-3s across the world, while European NATO countries share a fleet of 16 Sentries based in Geilenkirchen, Germany. Smaller numbers also serve in the air forces of France, the United Kingdom, and Saudi Arabia. The E-3G Block 40/45 upgrade replaces the Sentry's antiquated computers with a Red Hat Linux-based system for the main flight computer, and Windows-based operator workstations, which are connected to each other via a local area network. These will provide a new user interface and application for 15 crewmembers. The open-architecture operating systems are easy to update, and have "spare computing power for future capabilities" an Air Force spokesperson told War Is Boring. Furthermore, the E-3G's computers are designed to fuse air, sea, and land tracks into a single integrated sensor display, which should save time and reduce the likelihood of target identification errors. New ground-based computer terminals enhance mission-planning and post-mission data analysis. The Block 40/45 also incorporates a satellite communication system and digital upgrades that increase the flow of data to the E-3G, allowing it operate in more congested airspace and lower the number of communication technicians needed onboard the plane. The E-3G's Link 16 and 11 datalinks have also been optimized to decrease latency when transmitting targeting data for priority targets. Finally, there are modifications to improve the troublesome electromagnetic sensors—or Electronic Support Measures—added in the preceding Block 30/35 variant. All these advancements haven't come cheap. A 2014 spending and acquisitions report estimates that R&D and procurement expenditures on the E-3G program, which began well over a decade ago, would total more than $2.6 billion by 2016. The first upgraded E-3G at Tinkers Air Force Base in Oklahoma in 2010. Photo: USAF In 2012, a Testing & Evaluation report confidently asserted that while the E-3G demonstrated some "deficiencies," it was nonetheless consistently superior to the older Block 30/35 aircraft. By July 2014, the Air Combat Command declared Initial Operating Capability for the E-3G, which began service with the 552nd Air Control Wing. Two E-3Gs were first operationally deployed in support of anti-narcotics operations in the Caribbean, and in November 2015 the new Sentries began flying combat missions over the Middle East. By 2016, Boeing had converted nine aircraft to the Block 40/45 standard, most using older 32-bit hardware. However, the Air Force wished to conduct additional testing before converting the remaining aircraft to a more powerful 64-bit configuration with an improved ground support system. But the program's annual report reveals that the new trials didn't go smoothly. First of all, a cold weather test mission in Fairbanks, Alaska, literally failed to get off the ground because of problems with the radar and airframe unrelated to the new computer systems. Then, that summer, a Block 40/45 plane underwent competitive maritime surveillance trials versus an older Block 30/35 E-3 over the Gulf of Mexico. Both aircraft reportedly had "deficiencies" tracking the position of ships at sea, but the new Block 40/45 airplane proved "less effective." Furthermore, the E-3G's ground-based 1.0 operating systems overheated repeatedly. Finally, two Block 40/45 aircraft were deployed for the Red Flag 16–3 exercise conducted from Nellis Air Force Base in Nevada. These planes benefited from newer 3.0 Deployable Ground Support systems which continued to function despite sweltering heat, requiring only one restart during the three week-long exercise. However, the E-3Gs demonstrated "inaccurate track quality data processing and inconsistent IFF [Identify Friend or Foe] response displays to the operator." The Air Force also noted that the upgraded Electronic Support Measures system remained "not reliable." E-3 of 552nd Air Control Wing takes off from Nellis Air Force Base during Red Flag 16-2 exercise in March 2016. Photo: USAF Prior to Red Flag, however, the Block 40/45 had already failed a critical test—a three-week long Cooperative Vulnerability and Penetration Assessment to determine how easy it was to hack the E-3G and its ground support system under realistic operational conditions. "E-3G version 3.0 and supporting Block 40/45 ground systems are highly vulnerable to cyber threats and not survivable," the report tersely states. That result finally led the program executive officer to decline to certify the E-3G as ready for follow-on operational testing, bringing the trials to a temporary halt. They are slated to recommence in two years once the software has been revised to address the demonstrated shortcoming. What lay behind this disappointing performance? Though unable to comment on cyber-vulnerabilities, an Air Force spokesperson clarified the problem with the E-3's sensors in an email: "The primary cause of errors is traceable to legacy analog sensors, which were not upgraded as part of the Block 40/45 modification. Block 40/45 integrates data inputs from multi-sensor on-board and off-board systems, which provides the operator with a "single target-single track" capability. The current version of AWACS, Block 30/35, does not integrate its information to provide a single track, so the mission crew must take the information provided and manually create tracks from different sensor and communications datalinks." The Block 40/45 upgrade has a reasonable objective—to equip the Sentry with the kind of adaptable, networked computing capabilities that we take for granted in modern home computers. However, those networked systems may also leave the aircraft vulnerable to hacking. Indeed, both Russia and China have repeatedly demonstrated their ability to break into sensitive American military systems in the past few years. The two nations have also invested heavily in electronic countermeasures to reduce the effectiveness of the sensors and networked systems so integral to the US military's way of war. The program's annual report notes that the Air Force and Boeing should spend the next two years tweaking the software and hardware to reduce the Block 40/45's cyber vulnerabilities, prepare new training materials, and get the new operating systems to fuse tracking data effectively and accurately.

Donald Trump wants to increase defence spending by US$54 billion. But does that mean it’s a good time to buy into this sector?   0 by Mark Brown March 3rd, 2017 Online only.   0 Share: Facebook Twitter Google+ Share LinkedIn Email President Donald Trump speaks while aboard the nuclear aircraft carrier Gerald R. Ford, Thursday, March 2, 2017, at Newport News Shipbuilding in Newport, Va. (AP Photo/Pablo Martinez Monsivais) Donald Trump is carrying through with his election promise to increase spending in the military. How much? Try US$54 billion. And if there were any doubts, Trump commandeered a new US$13 billion aircraft carrier to let everyone knows he means business. Of course investors have heard grand promises by governments before. The question investors need to ask is whether this is a good time to put money into companies that align with such grand spending pronouncements? Short answer: Let’s just say that may not be the best strategy. Consider this. Republican Presidents are seen as being more favourable to the military; Democratic administrations are seen as being more dovish. If that’s true, you might expect defence stocks would do better when Republicans are in power. Who’s better for defence stocks? Republicans or Democrats To test this theory we compare the collective performance of four core defence stocks over the past five presidents. Specifically, we selected General Dynamics, Boeing, Raytheon and Northrop Grumman for our analysis because they were the largest members of the defence sub-index and they were some of the few companies that had data going back to the 1980s. For this example we used a balanced portfolio of these four stocks, rebalancing only when a new president took office. (We considered one of several defence sub-indicies, but none had a history longer than 20 years). It’s a small sample, but as you can see in the chart below an interesting pattern emerges. Defence stocks actually outperformed when President Bill Clinton and President Barack Obama were in office. None of this is to suggest that some defence stocks won’t benefit if the U.S. Congress approves his spending plan, but it may not be the tide to lift all stocks. It’s worth noting, however, that while these core defence stocks haven’t always been ahead of that market overall, they’ve held their value regardless of who’s living in the White House. While the market cratered at the end of George W. Bush’s time in office, these defence stocks stayed above water.

The anti-union pressures facing workers in Mississippi may be the worst of any place in America, he said. The Vermont senator intends to deliver a letter addressed to Jose Munoz, the chairman of Nissan’s North American unit, on Saturday following a march to the automaker’s plant in Canton. Signers including Sanders and actor Danny Glover refer in the letter to a 2015 National Labor Relations Board complaint regarding alleged anti-union conduct by Nissan management and recent occupational safety citations at the plant. ‘Deserve Better’ “We believe that Nissan employees in Canton deserve better -- and that workers’ rights are civil rights,” the letter reads, according to an advance copy obtained by Bloomberg News. “We look forward to the courtesy of a response.” Your cheat sheet on life, in one weekly email. Get our weekly Game Plan newsletter. Sign Up The mobilization is the latest step in a lengthy campaign by the UAW at the facility located in the mostly non-unionized U.S. South. Representing workers at the Nissan facility would mark a significant victory for the UAW, which has largely failed to organize Japanese, German or Korean automakers’ U.S. plants. As right-to-work laws encroach on longtime strongholds in the North and Midwest, union enrollment has dropped to a record low. Nissan’s response to the union campaign has included holding mandatory anti-union meetings for employees, according to the UAW. The 2015 NLRB complaint alleges Nissan management illegally threatened to fire employees or close the plant if they joined the UAW. The company denies the claims. “The allegations made by the union are totally false,” Nissan spokesman Brian Brockman said in an email. “Nissan respects and values the Canton workforce, and our history reflects that we recognize the employees’ rights to decide for themselves whether or not to have third-party representation.” Nissan will work with the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration to resolve in the near future two recent safety citations and continues to work with the federal agency to prevent future issues, Brockman said. Other signers of the letter Sanders plans to deliver will include the presidents of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and the Sierra Club, the environmental group that’s helped promote the Nissan Leaf electric car. Southern Labor Nissan produces the Altima sedan, Murano crossover, NV vans and Frontier and Titan pickups in Canton, according to a company website. The Canton rally follows a series of high-profile setbacks for organized labor in the South. In 2014, employees at Volkswagen AG’s Chattanooga, Tennessee plant voted against the UAW despite the company’s official neutrality -- though a smaller unit at the same plant approved unionization the following year. Employees at Boeing’s North Charleston, South Carolina, plant voted 3-to-1 last month against joining the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, following an anti-union campaign that workers said included frequent mandatory anti-union meetings as well as a flurry of ads on local TV. Sanders has a long history of lending support to organized labor campaigns. He delivers a much bigger spotlight following his showing against Hillary Clinton in the 2016 Democratic presidential primary. French Support The UAW has also found support in France. The nation’s government is a major shareholder of Renault SA, Nissan’s alliance partner. “We cannot accept that France and the French state shareholder of Renault scoff at the claims of their workers in the United States, while claiming to defend them in France,” Yannick Jadot, the former French green party presidential candidate, said in a French-language video posted on Twitter Friday. Sanders suggested President Donald Trump should follow his example. “It would be wonderful if tomorrow as we rally in Mississippi in support of workers who want a union, if President Trump would sent out a little tweet saying ‘I support the Nissan workers in their struggle for decent wages, decent benefits, and for a safe work environment.’ Now that would be a remarkable tweet.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

The president’s executive order mandating the use of U.S. steel is “specific to new pipelines or those that are being repaired,” White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders told reporters aboard Air Force One on Friday. “Since this one is already current, under construction, the steel is already literally sitting there, it would be hard to go back,” she said. That’s welcome news to TransCanada Corp. as its moves forward with the $8 billion project. The pipeline would span 1,179 miles (1,897 kilometers) from Alberta through three states -- Montana, South Dakota, and Nebraska -- before connecting to an existing network feeding crude to U.S. Gulf Coast refineries. The line would carry as much as 830,000 barrels of oil a day, including some from North Dakota’s Bakken shale. In 2012, the company said it expected half of the 821,000 tons of steel needed to construct the pipeline to be produced inside of the United States. The remainder of the steel was expected to be imported from Canada, Italy, and India. Public Comments But exempting Keystone XL from the president’s requirement to use American steel would seem to fly in the face of Trump’s public comments. Trump has repeatedly boasted that he forced pipeline companies to agree to use U.S. steel in their projects. During a Feb. 23 meeting with manufacturing CEOs at the White House, Trump told U.S. Steel Corp chief executive Mario Longhi that “the pipe is coming from the U.S.” for the Keystone project, as well as Energy Transfer Partners LP’s Dakota Access pipeline. “We put you heavy into the pipeline business because we approved, as you know, the Keystone Pipeline and Dakota,” Trump told Longhi. “But they have to buy -- meaning, steel, so I’ll say U.S. Steel -- but steel made in this country and pipelines made in this country.” During a Feb. 16 press conference, the president said that in exchange for using “the powers of government to make that pipeline happen” the administration “want them to use American steel.” American Steel “And they’re willing to do that, but nobody ever asked before I came along,” he said. “Even this order was drawn and they didn’t say that. And I’m reading the order, I’m saying, why aren’t we using American steel? And they said, that’s a good idea. We put it in.” He repeated the claim a day later during a tour of a Boeing Co. plant in South Carolina. “You probably saw the Keystone pipeline I approved recently, and the Dakota,” Trump said. “And I’m getting ready to sign the bill. I said, where is the pipe made? And they told me not here. I said, that’s good -- add a little sentence that you have to buy American steel. And you know what? That’s the way it is. It’s the way it’s going to be.” Trump told a similar story later that weekend at a Feb. 18 rally in Melbourne, Florida. Noting that he had had moved to “begin the construction” of the Keystone and Dakota projects, Trump said that as he was about to sign the order, he asked who would be manufacturing the pipe. “Something this audience understands very well, right?” Trump said. “Simple question. The lawyers put this very complex document in front. I said, who makes the pipe? They said, sir, it can be made anywhere. I said, not anymore. So I put a little clause on the bottom: The pipe has to be made in the United States of America if we’re going to have pipelines.” Under Construction Keep up with the best of Bloomberg Politics. Get our newsletter daily. Sign Up A White House official who would only discuss the pipeline issue on the condition of anonymity said the Commerce Department was working on a plan for the president’s order requiring U.S. steel, so the administration couldn’t implement it until that effort had completed. Moreover, the official said, because the Keystone XL pipeline is currently under construction it does not count as a new, retrofitted, repaired, or expanded pipeline. Asked about the issue, TransCanada issued a statement saying it continued “to be encouraged as our Presidential Permit application makes its way through the approval process.” “This project will support U.S. energy security, create thousands of well-paying U.S. jobs and provide substantial economic benefits,” the company said. Canada’s U.S. ambassador, David MacNaughton, said Friday in an interview that negotiations on Keystone’s route are going "extremely well" with federal authorities and "I don’t see any big hurdles" from the Trump administration. He called the outlook for the project "very positive." Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Tech Industry by Stephen Shankland March 2, 2017 2:18 PM PST @stshank Virgin Orbit plans to get small satellites into space cheaply and flexibly with small rockets launched from a jet. Virgin Orbit Elon Musk's rocket program at SpaceX is designed for massive payloads like communications satellites. But fellow space buff Richard Branson seems to be more interested in satellites that'll fit in the palm of your hand. On Wednesday Branson fired up Virgin Orbit, a new business focused on launching tiny satellites, often known as cubesats. The diminutive orbiters are increasingly popular since they're cheaper to build and can still do useful work, like imaging the entire Earth's surface daily, as in the case of Planet Labs' foot-long Dove satellites. Virgin Orbit is a spinoff from a team previously called LauncherOne. The project is designed to make launches quicker, easier and more flexible by dropping a launch rocket from a Boeing 747 jet called Cosmic Girl flying at 35,000 feet. Virgin Orbit is the third company in the Branson space effort. The first two are Virgin Galactic, which focuses on commercial human spaceflight, and the Spaceship Company, which builds spacecraft for Virgin Galactic. Virgin Orbit's leader is Dan Hart, who worked for aerospace giant Boeing for 34 years, including the post of vice president of government satellite systems.

Or maybe you think your city made a bad deal on a royalty settlement or parking lot contract, and you want to see the numbers. As a taxpayer, someone whose money is being spent on these deals, you deserve answers.  But you might not get them. Texas' Public Information Act is supposed to protect your right to such data. But two years ago, separate Texas Supreme Court rulings made it harder to get information about government dealings between private companies and nonprofits.  Since then companies and governments have used the ruling to be unresponsive to public requests.  It is a huge loophole that state Sen. Kirk Watson, D-Austin, and state Rep. Giovanni Capriglione, R-Southlake, are trying to close, with SB 407 and SB 408  in the Senate and companion bills HB 792 and HB 793 in the House. The legislation would apply state open records laws to a private entity or nonprofit that receives a government contract. Until 2015, that was already the case. But then the Texas Supreme Court ruled in Boeing vs. Paxton that companies could claim that contracts between businesses and government entities should be kept a secret to prevent business rivals from gaining a competitive advantage. The ruling broadened an exemption in public records law used to protect the government's competitive interests and allowed businesses to claim it, too.   The impact has been to keep civic watchdogs on a shorter and shorter leash. The Texas attorney general's office says it is seeing a sharp increase in firms and governments citing the Boeing decision as a  reason to withhold information that otherwise would have been made public. Editorial: Texas court ruling lets government keep contracts secret, inviting corruption to fester The other court case has been equally problematic for the cause of open government. In a dispute involving the Greater Houston Partnership, the court concluded that the Public Information Act applied only if the entity is "sustained" by public funds. That set too high a bar for public disclosure and weakened a longstanding practice requiring nonprofits that receive public funds or operate as a government to be subject to the Public Information Act. Here are just a few of the abuses after these rulings: The cost of a Kaufman County school district's food service contract with a private business is under wraps. Uber submitted the number of its drivers and some financial data to the city, but that's off-limits, too. Even the amount the city of McAllen paid singer Enrique Iglesias for an outdoor concert is a deep, dark secret — well after the event. Really? The protection of trade secrets and other proprietary information is vital to any business. But existing law already provides ample protections for proprietary information and trade secrets. The public interest isn't served if governments and their commercial or nonprofit partners can keep their business arrangements secret.  Texas needs a robust and progressive open records law. Closing these loopholes will keep it strong. What you can do Contact your legislator to register your support for SB 407, SB 408, HB 792 and HB 793 to strengthen Texas' Public Information Act.

Mr Malloch and his wife Beth falsely stated they had £36.3m in assets in order to take out the loans, according to court documents seen by the Financial Times.  When the couple filed for bankruptcy in 2013, the couple said they had just $152,000 and therefore could not repay the outstanding debt of $5.9m.

Three-year-old Wyatt Brazelton’s dad built him his own roller coaster in the backyard of their Oak Harbor home on Whidbey Island. Scott Brazelton, a Navy pilot, wanted some quality time with his son, because he’s often away from home on lengthy deployments, according to the Whidbey News Times. So instead of a tree house, Scott spent several weeks building a roller coaster out of PVC piping and two-by-fours. A YouTube video the family posted of Wyatt’s first ride has been viewed more than 103,000 times. Two Seattle television stations traveled to Whidbey Island this week to capture their own footage of a completely delighted boy riding the gravity-powered roller coaster down and around the falls and loops of the 140-foot track.

News Business Business Comment Theresa May's Government needs to forge better relationship with unions to make success of industrial strategy Amid the sound and fury of a critical report by MPs, what has been missed is a call for more dialogue and less sound and fury By James Moore Chief Business Commenyator Friday 3 March 2017 17:00 GMT Click to follow The Independent Online TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady calls for dialogue with Government on its industrial strategy BEN STANSALL/AFP/Getty Images Amid the sound and fury that accompanied a critical report on the Government’s much vaunted new industrial strategy by MPs on the Business Energy & Industrial Strategy Committee, it should not come as any surprise that no one paid much attention to its call for a little less of the sound and fury.  As part of their research, MPs on the committee took a visit to Sweden to learn about the successful implementation of an industrial strategy in a European economy that has been booming.  What struck MPs was the consensus they found within business, government and unions about its role.  Read more Industrial Strategy proposals 'do not match the rhetoric' say MPs CBI warns Government against ‘flash-in-the-pan industrial strategies’ Theresa May to set out 'Industrial Strategy' In their report they opine that an “adversarial culture, not just in parliamentary politics but in industrial relations, inhibits the possibility of a successful long-term industrial strategy”.  And there’s more: “It is notable that those sectors which have seen success in recent years (in Britain), particularly aerospace and automotive, have very productive and positive relationships between management and unions.” Much of the evidence the committee members received “emphasised the need for Government to work in partnership with business, local government, academia, trade unions and communities in order to develop and deliver its industrial strategy”.  They are right to raise this. And yet, by contrast to the healthy relationships built up in the above sectors, it’s hard to find much evidence of any similarly healthy working relationship between the Conservative Government and the trade unions in any sector.  To the contrary. Far too often unions are denounced by Conservative MPs, demeaned by their friends in the media (sometimes with their connivance) and made subject to laws that even countries not known for their friendliness towards the union movement baulk at.  The pre-Brexit Conservative Government of David Cameron dialled back on some of most repressive proposals during the passage of the Trade Union Act of 2016. It even suffered a defeat over the issue of collecting union fees through pay packets in the public sector.  But a repressive law still found its way on to the statute book, one that was notably opposed by the Chartered Institute of Personnel & Development, which described ministers' approach as outdated during the passage of the bill through Parliament. It argued instead for “dialogue-led approaches” to be taken by employers and unions, such as the signing of no-strike agreements.  I arrgued at the time that ministers would have done well to heed its progressive approach. The CIPD’s members, after all, find themselves at the sharp end when strikes occur. If they think an anti union law is a bad idea, then it's a bad idea.  Of course,  the forging of a new, and more constructive relationship, will require movement on the union side too.  But TUC general secretary Frances O’Grady’s statement in respone to the MPs' report suggests that is possible. “Unions are keen to work in partnership with government and business to make industrial strategy a success,” she said, while calling upon ministers to pay due heed to the MPs’ recommendations.  A reciprocation of that conciliatory tone from Number 10 Downing Street downward would be welcome, as would a willingness on the part of ministers to face down the more lumpen and ideologically driven MPs in their own party. It’s not as if the latter haven’t been given plenty of red meat to chew on with the Government’s approach to Brexit.  Business picture of the day 35 show all Business picture of the day 1/35 UK businesses are already facing recruitment crisis as Polish workers head home - Friday February 15 After a Brexit vote in which a primary concern was too much immigration, some might be applauding the trend, but for important UK industries it is already creating a serious problem, and one that provides a preview of what may be to come for the wider economy.

Getty 3/35 Plastics industry 'pressured UK Government to cut recycling targets' - Friday February 17 Recycling targets in the UK were cut last year after successful lobbying from the plastics industry, a freedom of information request by Greenpeace has revealed. The Government came under fire last year after it announced that targets for plastic recycling would be reduced from 57 per cent to a mere 49 per cent for 2016 and then increased by 2 per cent each year to 2020, to a maximum of 57 per cent by 2020.

Getty 7/35 Brexit: Bank of England upgrades growth forecasts but still expects UK economy to be hit - Thursday Ferbruary 2 The Bank of England has dramatically upgraded its growth forecast for this year but stressed that households will still experience a major squeeze on incomes due to rising inflation. In its latest Inflation Report, the Bank upgraded its 2017 GDP growth forecast to 2 per cent, up from 1.4 per cent in November. The revision is certain to be seized upon by Brexiteers as evidence that the economy will not suffer from leaving the European Union and that previous economic warnings from the Bank have now been exposed as scaremongering. Yet the Bank’s forecasts continue to project a growth slowdown in 2018 and 2019, with GDP expected to expand by 1.6 per cent and 1.7 per cent in those years.

It would be something more positive than “Brexit means Brexit”.  For that to happen, her Government needs to jettison the language of confrontation and to instead adopt a big tent approach. The pursuit of a more constructive relationship with unions would be a fine way to demonstrate that it is up to the challenge of doing that.  More about: TUC car industry industrial policy Immigration.

But most will agree, he’s put his crazy to good use by building a backyard roller coaster for his 3-year-old son, Wyatt. The idea came from a likely source, a theme park. “We took him to Disneyland a couple months ago and he just loved the roller coasters,” said Brazelton. The Navy pilot said that’s when his research started. “I researched it, and it actually wasn’t that complicated,” said Brazelton. But for safety sake, Brazelton also enlisted the help of Paul Gregg. Gregg is a Boeing engineer who lives in Seattle and has dedicated his retired life to building backyard roller coaster for his grandkids. He’s even written books and answered any questions Brazelton had about building a backyard coaster. It took Brazelton about two months to finish the project, working on it on the weekends.

Hastings Siegfried, second left, and China Airlines chairman Ho Nuan-hsuan, second right, yesterday hold up a memorandum of understanding they signed in Taipei on establishing an aircraft maintenance joint venture. Photo provided by China Airlines China Airlines Ltd (CAL, 中華航空) yesterday said it has inked a memorandum of understanding (MOU) on establishing an aircraft maintenance joint venture with US-based Nordam Group Inc to tap the Asian aviation maintenance market. The memorandum was signed in Taipei by CAL chairman Ho Nuan-hsuan (何煖軒) and Nordam vice chairman and chief operating officer of the Asia-Pacific region T. Hastings Siegfried. CAL, which declined to provide further details on the venture’s funding and shareholding, said that the new company would be the first in Asia to offer maintenance services for thrust reverser and other aircraft composite parts. The new company would be offering its services under the Nordam brand, CAL said, adding that its Tulsa, Oklahoma-based partner has been seeking to boost and expand its repair services in the Asian market since last year. Through the joint venture, CAL is hoping to elevate its capacity to perform thrust reverser maintenance for its own fleet, the airline said. Support from Nordam Group would also help the Taiwanese company’s capacity in servicing composite parts, such as aircraft nosecones, noise-reduction fins on aircraft wings as well as the fuselage, the airline said. The joint venture is a continuation of a decade-long partnership with Nordam Group in servicing airline’s fleet of Airbus Group SE and Boeing Co aircraft, the companies said at the signing ceremony. Aside from adding new long-haul flights to Europe, Ho has listed the airline's expansions into the aircraft maintenance market among his top priorities this year. CAL is aiming to leverage its position as the nation’s biggest airline in leading growth across Taiwan’s aerospace supply chain, and is looking to team up with Aerospace Industrial Development Corp (AIDC, 漢翔航空工業), the nation’s largest civilian and military aircraft manufacturer, Ho said last month. The company in January inked an agreement with Airbus to help the Taiwanese carrier improve its servicing capacity for Airbus aircraft, while setting its sights on aircraft retrofitting and cabin and frame modification businesses. Ho said in January that CAL was in talks with Airbus to establish a parts procurement center in Taoyuan and that it is helping it select an appropriate site for the project. In addition, CAL broke ground for a new facility that is to be operated by Taiwan Aircraft Maintenance and Engineering Co Ltd (台灣飛機維修), a fully owned subsidiary. CAL shares yesterday fell 0.99 percent to NT$10.05, underperforming the TAIEX. This story has been viewed 3310 times. Comments will be moderated.

Sci-Tech by Megan Wollerton March 3, 2017 6:58 AM PST @meganwollerton Amazon CEO and Blue Origin founder Jeff Bezos speaking at the 32nd Space Symposium on April 12, 2016. Bloomberg via Getty Images In a "proprietary and confidential" white paper sent to NASA and the Trump administration, Jeff Bezos' rocket company, Blue Origin, is proposing plans for establishing a colony on the moon. As reported by The Washington Post, the seven-page document emphasizes cargo missions over human transport. Of course, what lunar civilization would be complete without Amazon-style shipments of gear and food? We already know Bezos can't do without bacon. Blue Origin isn't the only private company designing rockets and conducting test flights for newfangled commercial operations in space. Boeing recently announced plans to use more than 600 3D-printed parts on its Starliner space taxis. Elon Musk's SpaceX and Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic are also working on their own visions for the future of space travel. Musk earlier this week revealed plans to send a pair of tourists on a trip around the moon, perhaps as soon as late 2018, a more modest goal than the vision he described last September of building a city on Mars a few decades down the road. SpaceX is already in the business of sending supplies to the International Space Station. Neither NASA nor Amazon immediately responded to our request for comment.

By Ari Cetron on March 3, 2017 Photo by Javen / Shutterstock.com Donald Trump is president, like it or not. And with a new administration comes changes in policy that will affect your portfolio. Some Trump policy changes and key Cabinet appointments came quickly, and their impact on financial markets has already started taking hold. In other areas, we have little more than general comments from the administration to indicate policy direction. Whatever you may think about the changes, it’s a good time to assess the investment risks and opportunities — which sectors are likely to surge, and which might flounder — under the Trump administration. Here are eight worth examining: 1. Infrastructure opportunities brewing Mark Agnor / Shutterstock.com Possibly one of the most obvious bets is in construction companies. Pipelines and giant walls are just two of the sorts of projects Trump has advocated during his first weeks in office. As a candidate, he also promised a $1 trillion infrastructure plan to rebuild many of the nation’s roads and bridges. If he can convince Congress to pay for it all, there could be lots of money flowing to construction companies over the next few years. Industrial equipment maker Caterpillar could see some of this cash come their way to purchase the backhoes and bulldozers required for big projects. Cemex, a Mexican company that makes concrete and cement, could also do well. The possibilities go beyond bridges and roads; there may also be major improvements and expansions to the nation’s communication networks and power infrastructure — a potential boon for companies that make and install things like power lines and fiber optic cables. 2. Energy industry shifts jaroslava V / Shutterstock.com Companies that mine uranium and run nuclear power plants are excited by the prospects under the Trump administration, owing to comments that suggest he’s pro-nuclear. Professionals urge care in investing in the industry, since it is quite volatile. Oil and gas companies have also rallied, since Trump seems to be a friend to companies that pull carbon out of the ground. One strong indication was his appointment of Rex Tillerson, the former CEO of ExxonMobil, to be his secretary of state. Trump often talks about revitalizing coal — in part by removing environmental regulations to rev up the industry — but problems with coal go beyond those regulations and are unlikely to be solved by the president. For one thing, plentiful natural gas has supplanted coal as the fuel of choice for utilities and other big users. Trump’s comments also signal renewable energy may become a loser. If his policies lower gas and oil prices, people won’t be as quick to switch to environmentally friendly energy sources like solar. Additionally, federal subsidies for these industries may dry up. While you can always buy shares in large companies like ExxonMobil or BP, it might be safer to look for a fund you like that trades in the sector. Check out this story for ideas. 3. Financial sector buoyant Rawpixel.com / Shutterstock.com While running for office, Trump said he wanted to do away with the “carried interest deduction” — a tax break for select investors, like hedge fund managers. But the industry and many investors are optimistic about his plans to cut many of the regulations imposed by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, which were put in place in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. Throw in the possible elimination of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and it could mean looser regulations and bigger profits for banks and other financial service companies. Following Trump’s inauguration, shares in the biggest banks surged. This includes heavy-hitters like Morgan Stanley, Wells Fargo, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Bank of America. By all indications, some experts say, the trend will continue. Additionally, if changes to tax policy allow the repatriation of the billions of dollars multinational companies currently are holding offshore, that could spark a wave of mergers, acquisitions and stock buybacks. In addition to the companies holding the offshore cash, like Apple and GE, the companies that help facilitate these transactions could do well. Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and other Wall Street big dogs will again be beneficiaries. 4. Health care turmoil tab62 / Shutterstock.com Anyone who can predict what’s going to happen to health care reform could make a fortune. The Republican Party in control of Congress is haggling over whether to “repeal and replace” the Affordable Care Act or “repair” the ACA, also called Obamacare. Until plans firm up, the sector will experience turmoil. The unpredictable nature of the sector makes it a risky investment. Trump’s comments about the big pharmaceutical companies “getting away with murder” clobbered prices in the sector in mid-January, though most rebounded after he met with pharmaceutical executives behind closed doors several days later. The president’s stance on drug pricing is now unclear, but some experts are bullish on drug companies. They point to multinationals like Pfizer or Novartis as companies likely to churn steady profits during the Trump administration. 5. Insurance expansion? Michal Chmurski / Shutterstock.com Trump wants to let insurance companies sell their products across state lines — health insurance in particular. How that would impact Americans’ access to health coverage remains to be seen, but the impact on insurers’ bottom lines will probably be positive. In addition, insurers are expecting to see higher yields, according to Financial Times (subscription wall). If you are interested in the industry, but not confident about choosing specific companies from among the big names (MetLife, Prudential Financial, et al.) consider investing in insurance sector funds. 6. Bullish on defense Chris Parypa Photography / Shutterstock.com Trump has claimed the U.S. military has been depleted. Though many experts disagree, a Republican Congress is often friendly toward increased defense spending. Some who study defense note there have been some mixed messages. Trump wants increases in defense spending, but he’s also taken to Twitter to complain about the cost of some projects such as the F-35 and Air Force One. On balance, analysts still expect the defense industry to do well in GOP-dominated Washington. If Trump follows through with plans to increase defense spending, that’s obviously good news for companies that make planes, ships, tanks and other equipment — such as Northrup Grumman, Lockheed Martin, Boeing, Raytheon and General Dynamics — as well as thousands of smaller companies that provide parts and services to those giants. 7. Caution: importers and exporters tonton / Shutterstock.com Yes, “importers and exporters” covers practically every major company, due to the emergence of global supply chains. Trump’s plans to rip up trade deals and impose high import tariffs create tremendous uncertainty for both. If he can actually get better deals through trade negotiations, there might be a net positive for the economy. But if the proposed Border Adjustment Tax turns into reality, the first casualties would be U.S. importers because it will make the goods they are bringing in more expensive. (Some economists have argued that such a tax could hurt the overall economy.) Secondarily, the shift in trade practices could spark retaliation by foreign governments against U.S. goods — thus harming American exporters. 8. Tech uncertainty ra2studio.jpg / Shutterstock.com According to Code.org, there are more than 527,000 computing jobs open nationwide but fewer than 43,000 people last year who earned computer science degrees. Trump’s moves to curtail immigration and potentially shrink the H-1B visa program (which allows the temporary hiring of foreign workers in specialty occupations) could hurt tech companies’ ability to hire enough workers. Add to that the fact that tech companies are big exporters, and these could be tough times for the sector. While some might get a short-term boost if companies are allowed to repatriate overseas holdings, most experts agree that positive will be outweighed by the negatives.

News Business Business News Agent Provocateur sale to Sports Direct is a ‘preposterous disgrace to British business', says lingerie brand’s founder Business became unviable after identifying ‘material misstatements’ in its accounts over a number of years that the company’s board, auditors and owners had failed to notice Ben Chapman Friday 3 March 2017 14:15 GMT Click to follow The Independent Online Joe Corré branded the deal ‘a phenomenal stitch-up’ Reuters The sale of Agent Provocateur by private equity firm 3i to a company part-owned by Sports Direct owner Mike Ashley is “preposterous” and “a disgrace”, the lingerie brand’s founder has reportedly said. Joe Corré, son of Vivienne Westwood and former Sex Pistols manager Malcolm McLaren, who founded the chain in 1994 told The Guardian: “The pre-pack arrangement between 3i and Mike Ashley’s Sports Direct is a disgrace to British business up there with Sir Philip Green’s shocking behaviour over BHS. “If this preposterous deal goes ahead with Mike Ashley, 3i and their partners are going to face a phenomenal swath of litigation actions. 3i’s reputation is going to be left in tatters. I don’t think they will ever recover from this. This is a phenomenal stitch-up. Read more Sports Direct's Mike Ashley buys Agent Provocateur “Just how 3i have decided the right business model is to deliberately road crash the business to wipe out anything owed to creditors or the taxman is quite unbelievable, when a higher offer on the table avoids them taking such action. This is bad practice at its worst.” Agent Provocateur was sold by consultants Alix Partners through a controversial “pre-pack” deal to Four Holdings, which Mike Ashley part-owns. The structure of the deal means Four Holdings can agree to the sale of the assets before buying the business and putting it into administration. This means the administrator can sell the assets immediately, without consulting the unsecured creditors, who are likely to lose most of their money. In order to pursue a pre-pack, directors must first show that they have exhausted all other options for a sale and the possibility of keeping the business running as a going concern. Read more Agent Provocateur could be heading for administration Agent Provocateur is being lined up for possible sale Paloma Faith opens up about her jobs at Agent Provocateur Investor 3i holding on to its underwear with Agent Provocateur A spokesperson for 3i, which bought Agent Provocateur in 2007, said last year it identified “material misstatements” in the company’s accounts over a number of years that the company’s Board, auditors and 3i as owners, had failed to notice. “It became clear that the business was not sustainable in its current form and the Board appointed Rothschild to seek new investment for the business to allow it to continue as a going concern. Given the scale of the issues this was not possible,” the spokesperson said, adding that 3i had no role in choosing the buyer and does not expect to recover any money from the sale. The move from Mr Ashley is the latest of his efforts to move from Sports Direct’s pile-it-high, sell-it-cheap model. Earlier this month the company bought an 11 per cent stake in struggling fashion chain French Connection.

Reuters 2/35 Global sales of UK food and drink hit the £20bn mark for the first time - Tuesday February 21 Global sales of UK food and drink have hit the £20bn mark for the first time in history, as the Government prepares to ramp up its focus on international trade following the UK’s decision to leave the EU. Getty 3/35 Plastics industry 'pressured UK Government to cut recycling targets' - Friday February 17 Recycling targets in the UK were cut last year after successful lobbying from the plastics industry, a freedom of information request by Greenpeace has revealed. The Government came under fire last year after it announced that targets for plastic recycling would be reduced from 57 per cent to a mere 49 per cent for 2016 and then increased by 2 per cent each year to 2020, to a maximum of 57 per cent by 2020. AFP/Getty 4/35 Inflation hits 1.8% as post-Brexit pound weakness feeds through to high street - Tuesday February 14 UK consumer price inflation jumped to 1.8 per cent in the year to January, from a rise of 1.6 per cent in the year to December, as the slump in the pound since the Brexit referendum continued to trickle through to the high street. According to data from the Office for National Statistics published on Tuesday, January’s rise was the biggest since June 2014. But the jump narrowly missed analyst expectations for a 1.9 per cent increase, just below the Bank of England’s official 2 per cent target. Getty Images 5/35 Lettuce crisis hits those who love it most: hungry British sea turtles - Friday February 10 The UK’s vegetable crisis has not only gripped the country’s supermarkets and healthy eaters, but also a bale of 12 hungry green sea turtles in aquariums across the country.

Tim Cook met Ms May at Downing Street on Thursday morning and reiterated the tech giant's plans to build a new UK headquarters at the Battersea Power Station as proof of the company's support of the UK. Getty 7/35 Brexit: Bank of England upgrades growth forecasts but still expects UK economy to be hit - Thursday Ferbruary 2 The Bank of England has dramatically upgraded its growth forecast for this year but stressed that households will still experience a major squeeze on incomes due to rising inflation. In its latest Inflation Report, the Bank upgraded its 2017 GDP growth forecast to 2 per cent, up from 1.4 per cent in November. The revision is certain to be seized upon by Brexiteers as evidence that the economy will not suffer from leaving the European Union and that previous economic warnings from the Bank have now been exposed as scaremongering. Yet the Bank’s forecasts continue to project a growth slowdown in 2018 and 2019, with GDP expected to expand by 1.6 per cent and 1.7 per cent in those years.

The investigation comes after online fashion retailer Asos was accused last year of exploitative working practises with staff reportedly unable to take regular water and toilet breaks for fears of missing targets. The company denied those allegations.

In a joint statement, the two companies said that the combined group would bring benefits for consumers, independent retailers, caterers, small businesses, suppliers, and colleagues, and deliver “significant value to shareholders”. Tesco 11/35 Tobacco giant Imperial Brands scraps chief executive pay rise - Thursday January 26 The chief executive of Imperial Brands, the maker of Gauloises and Winston cigarettes, is unlikely to get a pay rise this year in what seems to be another battle over boardroom greed. Alison Cooper received a total pay package of £5.5m in the last financial year, up from £3.6m the year before. ADVERTISING inRead invented by Teads READ MORE Link between high executive pay and performance ‘negligible’ A new pay policy that would have had the effect of taking Ms Cooper’s remuneration to £8.5m in 2017 was expected to be put to a shareholders’ vote on 1 February.

In her speech in London on Tuesday, Ms May confirmed that Britain will leave the EU’s single market to regain control of immigration policy and said that she wants to renegotiate the UK’s customs agreement and seek a transition period to phase in changes all while remaining a “best friend” to the bloc.

Lockheed Martin GPS III satellite in environmental testing at the company’s GPS III Processing Facility near Denver Copyright Lockheed Martin Advertisement The U.S. Air Force has opened a review of the propulsion systems used for Lockheed Martin Corp.’s (IW 500/25) military satellites after an undisclosed problem during a recent attempt to boost one into orbit, according to the service. The review has delayed once again the Air Force’s acceptance of Lockheed’s first new Global Positioning System satellite, which is already 34 months late. The most recent delivery goal had been Feb. 28, and the plan remains to launch it by spring of 2018. While there’s no evidence that the propulsion system on the first, $528 million satellite in the new GPS III series has a flaw, the Air Force has decided to keep it in storage at a Lockheed facility “out of an abundance of caution,” Captain AnnMarie Annicelli, an Air Force spokeswoman, said in an email. It was placed into storage “after having successfully completed all planned test and integration activities,” she said. Popular Now 12 Key Strategies to Achieving a Work-Life Balance Five Elements to Include in a Compelling Business Case OEE – Learn How to Use It Right The review of Lockheed’s A2100 propulsion subsystem involves the GPS III -- an improved version of the navigation systems used by the military and civilians worldwide -- as well as the company’s Advanced Extremely-High Frequency communication satellite and its Space Based Infrared early warning satellite, Annicelli said. Matt Kramer, a spokesman for Lockheed’s space systems unit, said in an email “more than 50 Lockheed Martin A2100 bus satellites are operating successfully on orbit.” The Air Force and Lockheed Martin “are thoroughly evaluating” the GPS III’s A2100 system prior to declaring the satellite available for launch, Kramer said. “This review is a standard process for our rigorous systems engineering approach to assure mission success” as the company “is working closely with the Air Force on resolving any concerns about the mission readiness of” the satellite’s propulsion system, he said. The review is focused on operations that boost into proper orbit military satellites that use the contractor’s A2100 system, Annicelli said, declining to provide additional details. Satellites boost themselves into a designated orbit using on-board propulsion systems in what’s called a “transfer orbit operation.” Subsystem Performance Evaluation “This review will assure” that the first GPS III satellite is ready to launch next year, she said. The Air Force’s Space and Missile Systems Center “is currently evaluating subsystem performance" across the three Lockheed satellite programs, she said. “It is not possible to give a definite prediction on how long it will take" to finish the review, she said. The GPS III satellite is far behind its original delivery schedule because of technical flaws, first with its navigation payloads and later with ceramic capacitors, which take higher-voltage power from the satellite’s power system and reduce it to a voltage required for a particular subsystem. Most recently, a mistake by subcontractor Harris Corp. in testing forced another delay in the delivery on the first of the 32 planned GPS III satellites. Might Satellite Competition Reopen? Lockheed has a contract to build the first 10 of the satellites. But the program’s setbacks, including the new review, may affect a pending Air Force decision on whether to open the final 22 satellites to competition from Lockheed rivals Boeing Co. and Northrop Grumman Corp. The Defense Contract Management Agency estimates that the second through eighth satellites that Lockheed is building will be delivered six months to one year later than the Air Force’s schedule, spokesman Mark Woodbury in an email. The Air Force estimates the second satellite will be delivered in February 2018, while the contract agency projects August 2018. The third is scheduled for August 2018 delivery, but the agency says it will be March 2019. The fourth is scheduled for January 2019 by the Air Force and for August 2019 by the agency. The seventh is scheduled for February 2020, but the agency predicts January 2021. The eighth is scheduled for May 2020, while the agency forecasts June 2021. The agency’s dates “are based on a conservative confidence level” while Lockheed is “managing to a more aggressive schedule” and that anticipated deliveries will improve as more lessons are learned in manufacturing, Woodbury said. The difference between the Air Force and agency “is due to different forecasting approaches,” Annicelli said.

Credit: Matt Mills McKnight With an executive order from the governor, a lawsuit and a trio of bills, Democratic leaders in Olympia have shaped a response to President Donald Trump’s immigration agenda that is notable for its loud resistance on multiple fronts. But the response, other than the lawsuit, also is stopping short of action taken in some other states. Gov. Jay Inslee’s executive order, which he rolled out last week, bars state agencies like the Washington State Patrol from taking part in immigration crackdowns targeting non-criminals. It came out of the same closed-door discussions among Democrats in Olympia that produced three bills in the state House the week before, including one that would set a narrower version of the same prohibition into law. And Washington Attorney General Bob Ferguson made national and even international news when, alongside Inslee, he launched a lawsuit that has blocked the key parts of the Trump executive order freezing immigration and refugee flows from seven majority-Muslim nations. Elected officials here have been clear that they are still assessing how to respond to the Trump adiminstration, which is still in its early days. But many have been quick to praise their leadership. The Nation gave Inslee prominent place in a story headlined, “West Coast politicians are fighting back against Donald Trump.” And Inslee couldn’t resist a little state pride while talking with KCTS 9’s Enrique Cerna last month about the lawsuit, saying, “I’m glad that … we’ve got courage in this state to show the way to the rest of the country. But, as aggressive as the state’s moves are, each also displays a clear limit, and with the exception of Ferguson’s lawsuit, stops short of action taken in at least some other state. Together, they point to a question of how deeply officials are interested in wading into a fight against Trump that may stray from the photogenic and into more ambiguous territory where state powers and options for challenging federal action are unclear. Among those questions: What to do about reports of federal agents checking papers at a bus terminal in Spokane, or the prospect of a return to George W. Bush-era immigration checkpoints on the Olympic Peninsula? So far, it’s unclear whether the Trump administration may want to return some of the most aggressive tactics used by U.S. Customs and Border Patrol such as the checkpoints, which were the subject of controversy in 2008 and 2009. But the Spokane episode, verified by the Northwest Immigrants Rights Project, and an apparent increase in detentions by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, both raise worrying questions about activities that could have deeper day-to-day impacts  than Trump’s ignominiously failed immigration order. “We are definitely seeing an increase in activity from ICE,” said Jorge Barón, head of the Northwest Immigrants’ Rights Project, the only non-government group that is able to regularly meet with detainees facing deportation in the state. So far, much of that has meant targeting those with pre-existing deportation orders, but the agency apparently has also shifted to frequently detaining those who happen to be nearby when ICE agents show up. According to Barón and other advocates, that means people without records are being swept up for being without documentation in the wrong place at the wrong time. And Barón said his organization received multiple reports of Border Patrol agents stationing themselves near a public bus terminal in Spokane earlier this month, and periodically pulling people off of buses. The actions taken by state officials, while bold, so far largely sidestep any direct approach to increased ICE raids, or the kind of activity by the Border Patrol that Barón describes. Instead, they sketch out an approach geared toward pre-empting any coordination between federal and state agencies on immigration, and taking specific, limited steps to shield migrants at the state level. And with one exception, they avoid actively assisting migrants, especially the undocumented.   There are few clear avenues by which the state can directly resist Trump’s orders. Laws that target immigrants are typically federal, meaning that as with the president’s executive order, fighting them directly requires a lawsuit. And states challenging federal laws often are at a disadvantage since, under the Constitution, they generally rank below the U.S. government in powers. At the same time, however, examples exist of other states — and especially one other state — doing more. Inslee’s recent executive order bars state agencies from sharing immigration-related information with federal authorities, assisting federal agents in arresting immigrants who haven’t committed crimes, or helping set up any religious database. The three bills in the state House move in the same direction. Based according to one of the bill’s sponsors on the same internal discussions that shaped Inslee’s order, they propose limiting information-sharing that could facilitate a religious registry, appointing guardians to immigrant minors left in the country when their parents are forced to leave, and establishing a hotline for immigrants to report bias crimes and connect with legal assistance. Yet, while a hotline is the subject of one of the three House bills, the proposal’s fate is an open question, and the idea that creating such a hotline requires an act of the Legislature is an example of caution in the extreme: The attorney general of Massachusetts created one to track hate and bias incidents less than a week after the November election. While the FBI tracks hate crimes around the country, advocates described a variety of less serious incidents that aren’t tracked, ranging from graffiti to the harassment of women wearing hijabs. Anecdotal reports point to an increase. Sharon Ortiz, director of the Washington State Human Rights Commission, the agency that would administer the proposed hotline, said, “There’s more incidents that we’re hearing about now.” Colleen Melody, head of the 12-person civil rights unit within the Washington Attorney General’s Office, said that the unit does have a toll-free number for civil rights complaints. But instead of being live, the number leads callers to a voicemail that is then checked by staff later. Another strategy for directly assisting immigrants that has been embraced around the country is the creation of legal defense funds. Immigrants facing deportation aren’t entitled to an attorney Immigrants facing deportation aren’t entitled to an attorney the way criminal defendants are, but following Trump’s election, city councils in Seattle, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Chicago, and Washington, D.C., have pledged funds ranging between $500,000 and $10 million to pay for defense attorneys for immigrants caught in a crackdown. All of it might be easy to dismiss if another state hadn’t already checked both boxes — plus one more — less than a month after Trump’s election. By Nov. 20, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo had launched a toll-free hotline for bias incidents, set up a legal defense fund for immigrants, and established a dedicated unit within the New York State Patrol to investigate bias and hate crimes. Inslee has demonstrated the power of his office in the past. Last year he famously launched a late-night blockade, threatening to veto every bill sent to him until the Legislature completed budget negotiations and authorized a school funding task force. And in 2013 he even forced legislators to return to the Capitol in November for a special session with one goal: rewriting tax breaks for Boeing. For now, however, that power is one he appears content to wield strategically. And, while Washington Attorney General Bob Ferguson has received praise nationally and abroad for both his courage and legal tactics in the state’s dramatic success in blocking Trump’s immigration order, there’s another step he hasn’t taken: So far, his office hasn’t filed an amicus brief in the case of Daniel Ramirez Medina, the Mexican citizen and Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals beneficiary picked up by ICE last month. While an attorney general is generally only able to get directly involved in cases that affect the state’s interests, an amicus brief is a common way for third parties to offer their opinion to a court, and can influence the outcome.   Perhaps ironically, the question of how to respond to Trump on specifics may be one that looms larger for state leaders if Trump starts thinking smaller. With the stifling of his most dramatic executive order, Trump could turn to avenues — like formal and informal directions to agencies to increase certain types of enforcement, or coordinating with congressional leaders to push an expansion of deportable offenses — that would stand up to legal challenges. That would test exactly how far officials including Inslee and Ferguson are willing to follow Trump into the weeds of, say, pushing back against increased actions by the Border Patrol within the 100 mile radius of the border where they have special legal powers. Even if state police don’t get involved with helping them, federal agents can — and already do — arrest people in, for instance, the middle of downtown Seattle. Inslee and Ferguson were unavailable to comment Thursday afternoon for this story, but spokespersons from both offices defended their efforts. “While there’s plenty of credit to go around, I’m sure I don’t need to remind you that the Washington State Attorney General’s Office filed the first lawsuit on behalf of the state,” wrote a spokesperson from Ferguson’s office in an email, noting that the injunction it won is still in effect. The spokesperson also pointed to past legal cases enhancing general legal protections for migrants. Along with his executive order, wrote a spokesperson from Inslee’s office, “Governor Inslee has also been on record, numerous times, in strong support of protections for immigrants and refugees dating back long before President Trump.” The law is fairly clear in limiting the governor’s direct power over cities and counties — including local police — so long as they follow state law. So, while he has set an example of the approach he favors and has spoken of the public-safety value of having immigrants unafraid of their local police, it’s up to cities how their police operate. With a crowded calendar, the Legislature may not get around to changing state law to protect immigrants. But what is available to both Inslee and Ferguson, as independently elected officials is the ability to start initiatives, assign staff and set up task forces within their own offices. Either one, for example, could start or help start a staffed hotline to answer basic questions and connect immigrants with legal help from nonprofits around the state. Either one could also direct their staff to begin the work of tracking not only hate crimes, but also bias incidents around the state, something lawmakers and advocates alike expressed surprise isn’t already being done. And either one could use their bully pulpits, magnified by airtime on national TV news, to start the conversation now about what advocates consider the very real prospect of increased enforcement action that falls within the scope of existing law. They could talk about whether the state is ready to accept the idea of agents at bus stations pulling people aside for questioning based on some set of assumptions around skin complexion. For now, it’s clear is that the state is responding to Trump, and doing so in ways that anger his supporters in Washington and elsewhere. Inslee’s executive order sets clear limits on cooperation by state personnel — especially the State Patrol — with ICE, and Ferguson’s lawsuit set a national precedent for responding to orders of questionable constitutionality. Whether or not those two moves put Washington in the lead of the liberal movement to resist the president, though, seems an open question.

News Business Business Comment Zero Hours Contracts hit a new record but there might be grounds for optimism The rate of increase slowed dramatically in the second half of 2016 according to an analysis by the Resolution Foundation James Moore Chief Business Commentator @JimMooreJourno Friday 3 March 2017 12:35 GMT Click to follow The Independent Online Sports Direct: The controversy over its use of zero hours contracts may have slowed their growth Reuters You could be forgiven for thinking that the controversy surrounding zero hours contracts (ZHCs) is having zero impact on the employers that exploit their staff through their use.  The figures just released by the Resolution Foundation appear to make for grim reading: The number of workers on them reached an all time high of 910,000 during the final three months of 2016. The Foundation's analysis found that the number of people on a ZHC over that period grew by more than 100,000 when compared with the last three months of 2015 – an increase of 13 per cent. Read more Surge in insecure work costs UK £4bn in lost taxes Zero hours contract staff earn £1,000 a year less TUC right to attack rising tide of zero-hours misery Based on that, you might expect the symbolically important barrier of 1m to soon be breached, perhaps in a matter of weeks.  However, there are some chinks of light to be found within the Resolution report.  While the year on year rise makes it look like this potentially exploitative form of employment is growing like President Donald Trump’s ego, the rate of increase in the second half of this year, when compared to the first half, slowed markedly.  In fact the number of ZHCs grew by just 7,000 over that time period, a rise of just 0.8 per cent. That represents a sharp slowdown when set against the 7.7 per cent growth recorded during the second half of 2015 and would suggest that we might have to wait a while for the 1m barrier to be broken after all. The increase was also slightly slower than the rate of employment growth across the economy during that period. So the proportion of the overall workforce on zero hours fell, albeit very slightly. The Foundation says that this is the first time that ZHCs haven’t grown substantially faster than overall employment since they first became a part of the public debate back in 2013. What's causing this? The Foundation wonders whether part of the reason might be that employers have started to react to concerns that they may find roles without guaranteed hours harder to fill as a result of the Government's hard line stance towards Brexit. However, that may result in a slowdown in hiring generally, so it isn't altogether clear and some have predicted a fresh jump in zero hours contracts as a result of the economic damage it will cause. There are other factors driving the fall in zero hours. Public awareness about them and about their exploitative nature, may be putting workers off from pursuing and accepting zero hours jobs. It is also true that firms deploying them have endured considerable reputational damage. The scandalous events at Sports Direct over the last couple of years have provided a salutary lesson to the business community. Treating your workers badly can rebound on you and damage your business.  Sports Direct had little choice but to respond, by offering its workers better. Others have followed suit and still more, who might have been considering a greater use of ZHCs, have been given pause for thought. So is the problem on the way to being solved? Not necessarily.  We don’t yet know whether the slowdown in the second half of last year will be sustained. There are grounds for cautious optimism, but they will be shattered if it proves to be just a blip.  Zero hours contracts started to become problematic when they were made part of the operating models of companies in sectors where they had not previously existed, or had only limited use, such as retail. However, there are economic drivers for their growth in certain other sectors, such as social care, which is in the midst of a profound funding crisis that badly needs addressing.  Business picture of the day 35 show all Business picture of the day 1/35 UK businesses are already facing recruitment crisis as Polish workers head home - Friday February 15 After a Brexit vote in which a primary concern was too much immigration, some might be applauding the trend, but for important UK industries it is already creating a serious problem, and one that provides a preview of what may be to come for the wider economy.

In its latest Inflation Report, the Bank upgraded its 2017 GDP growth forecast to 2 per cent, up from 1.4 per cent in November. The revision is certain to be seized upon by Brexiteers as evidence that the economy will not suffer from leaving the European Union and that previous economic warnings from the Bank have now been exposed as scaremongering. Yet the Bank’s forecasts continue to project a growth slowdown in 2018 and 2019, with GDP expected to expand by 1.6 per cent and 1.7 per cent in those years.

Now imagine that aircraft is a 1,199mph, $100 million jet, and the carrier is the £3.1 billion, 280-metre-long pride of the Royal Navy. Even seasoned pilots with a constitution of graphene might take issue with that prospect. So they come to a small Lancashire village to practice what is not yet a reality. Here, in Warton, the ocean undulates with hypnotic rhythm all around us. It would be soothing if it were not for that jet engine roaring beneath us, seeming to echo off the waters. It’s the sound of BAE Systems’ £2 million F-35B simulator, a highly secretive (WIRED was not allowed to photograph the control screen) and realistic training model finished in February for British pilots who come here to practice landings. The massive curved 360-degree screens fill the domed room around the ‘jet’, completing the oceanic mirage. Shipborne rolling vertical landings (SRVL) have never been attempted with the F-35B, and cannot be attempted until the HMS Queen Elizabeth carrier - the future home of the Royal Navy and Royal Air Force fleet of F-35Bs - is unveiled in 2018. ADVERTISEMENT “The only place you can do it right now is here, in this facility, where we get to see the ship and the aircraft in intricate detail,” Pete 'Wizzer' Wilson, BAE Systems’ test pilot, tells WIRED. His job is to make sure the simulator is as close to the real thing as possible, and he’s uniquely equipped to do this as a test pilot of the F-35B and F-35C which he's been flying out of Maryland in the US for the past six years. So far, he's having trouble finding fault with it.

The dome, however, does allow test pilots to focus on scenes at a greater distance than most simulators and provides realistic details in their peripheral vision - waves, for instance, and other visual and audio cues - that can make the worst parts of supersonic jet flight seem unforgivingly real.

You believe you’re there, that’s the power of a simulator of this quality. It’s quite awesome, quite effective, quite emotional,” continues Wilson. “Crashing an aeroplane is a hideous thing for a pilot to even contemplate but we occasionally end up with a situation where we are going to crash [in the simulation] and I’ll see the engineers with eyes wide open watching the crash. I can’t do it. I can’t watch the crash. I close my eyes and I shy away because I can’t watch it, because it’s so real it’s like I’m just about to die, even though I’m in the simulator.” ADVERTISEMENT READ NEXT WhatsApp launches video calling for one billion people. Here's how to use it WhatsApp launches video calling for one billion people. Here's how to use it By Matt Burgess The simulator is designed to let pilots practice, over and over, the hardest parts of their takeoff and landing on the HMS Queen Elizabeth, to mitigate those risks. It also helps with the more mundane aspects of navigating around a 280-metre-long carrier and its many moving parts, and the details of how all the communications networks onboard will eventually work together. “We focus on the areas where we think the risk is greatest or there is most to be learnt,” says Wilson. “Most of the time we’re testing the final stages of that SRVL landing with a lot of ship motion, that’s really the majority of the time. Different configurations of weapons, friction on the flight deck where it’s slippery, oil that can still contaminates this new surface.” The F-35 is built to do a short take-off and vertical landing (STOVL), the move previously made infamous in the Royal Navy by the Harrier jet, which Wilson also flew. He has 100 vertical landings under his belt as a former Royal Navy pilot, but the British forces have opted for a far riskier, but ultimately more rewarding, type of landing. Vertical landings, where the jet comes in at a hover and gradually touches down, work by using all the aircraft’s thrust. But the jet is capable of a finite amount of thrust, which means there is a finite amount of weight it can support in the air while doing this. The result is that US F-35s operating the vertical landing are either carrying less weaponry during training exercises, or dropping munitions in the sea before coming back in to land. Carrier simulator BAE Systems READ NEXT Highlights from day two of WIRED2016 Highlights from day two of WIRED2016 “The UK decided it wanted to be able to bring back a higher level of payload than the F-35B can hover with, which is quite a major problem because it was not designed to do that,” says Wilson. “So we had to come up with a new type of manoeuvre.” The SRVL works by keeping ‘forward speed’ on, so the wings are operating to provide some lift. “The Americans have decided they don’t need to employ this new type of landing yet but I think it’s a matter of time before they will start deploying similar capabilities. Over the years, America has adopted many of our inventions, way back in the 1940s, 50s and 60s. They are very much reliant on many of our inventions, and this may be a similar case.” This is a good justification for what has been one of the most anticipated - and oft times most controversial - pieces of equipment in modern military history. Anticipated because the F-35 is slated to replace the majority of the US airforce’s fleet and form the centrepiece of the UK’s Royal Navy and Royal Air Force from 2018. Controversial because of the cost and delays associated with it. Globally, it has been reported the F-35 project will cost $1.5 trillion in its lifetime, with the UK's order of 138 F-35s running into tens of billions of pounds. This makes it the most expensive single military project, ever. Before taking office, president Donald Trump tweeted his disdain for the spiralling costs of the fleet and threatened to commission competitor Boeing instead (Lockheed Martin is the main maunfacturer, with BAE Systems and others contributing). He has since falsely taken credit for the lowered costs of the F-35 programme - the Pentagon had already announced a saving of $600 million. Delays in production, and problems with the jet's 'brains', the Autonomic Logistics Information System (Alis) software, have also led to cost increases. Based on the tremendous cost and cost overruns of the Lockheed Martin F-35, I have asked Boeing to price-out a comparable F-18 Super Hornet!— Donald J.

There are inherent risks with the SRVL landing, which is only possible because of the size of the flight deck on HMS Queen Elizabeth. Risks like, the jet falling off the deck when it comes in to land. “You might have a slippery deck, or you’re too close to the front, or the engine doesn’t go idle at the right time - there are several things that can happen and you’re just going to drop off the front and lose the airplane. So this is why it’s super important to do this level of engineering to make sure we are safe in every respect that we can possibly understand before we go out and execute it.” All of these aspects of the landing, are trialled in the simulator. Everything from the weather conditions, traction on the deck and the weight of the aircraft can be manipulated.

As a direct result of sims like these working together, facets of the HMS Queen Elizabeth have already been modified ahead of its 2018 unveiling. The ski ramp was altered to account for the weight change, for example (F-35s weigh 60,000 pounds to a Harrier’s 30,000 pounds), and lights on the deck have been modified to make landing safer. “If you have a carrier that’s moving up and down on the water, and you’re trying to land on it; if you’re coming down a fixed glide path and not trying to go up and down with it which is awkward, it’s unpredictable where you’re going to touch down,” explains Wilson. “If the carrier is low you might land very long, remember we talked about the possibility of running off the end?” The new lighting system flashes on and off, up and down the deck in such a way that the pilot always has a fixed point to aim for, no matter the movement of the ship or the weather. “It’s the reason why we bothered with this,” Wilson says, indicating to the simulator. “If it’s done properly, you learn so much.” The UK has not had a carrier of the magnitude of HMS Queen Elizabeth since the HMS Illustrious was decommissioned in 2014. Since then, a helicopter carrier has taken over and jet pilots have been on an exchange programme to the US to keep their skills up. When HMS Queen Elizabeth is finally unveiled it will be the largest operational carrier the Royal Navy has ever had, with another controversial price tag to match - the carrier, and its twin HMS Prince of Wales, cost £6.2 billion together. But the design and size of the carrier will also allow for another generation of fighters: unmanned aerial vehicles. Beyond the ski ramp for F-35s, there is an angled deck that will enable UAVs to takeoff in the future. The carriers could fit between 30 and 40 F-35s ondeck and below, but it could potentially host hundreds of UAVs one day. Wilson, who has spent the past 33 years flying jets, is not troubled by the prospect. With the right human oversight and controls, he welcomes it. “I'm not worried about being out of a job anytime soon - I think UAVs have a very important part to play. I hope most UAVs are going to be too small for a pilot to get in because that’s the beauty of these little whizzy things - they can go and do a job and fly around for hours before being thrown away. "There are several things that can happen and you’re just going to drop off the front and lose the airplane" Pete 'Wizzer' Wilson, BAE Systems test pilot “They can put themselves in harm's way when we wouldn't want to put a human pilot there. It’s making warfare more tolerable for the community, for the population, because we don’t lose people. Which is a super important point.” Wilson is the personable face of warfare because he is not, despite the entire content of our dialogue on the details of weaponry and battle, a “warmonger”, in his words. It does not seem lost on him that a UAV can keep war at arm’s reach of the nation states with the funds to afford them, and their populace. But he's ok with that. Ultimately he believes the object of building F-35s, mammoth carriers and hundreds of automated killing machines, is so you never have to use them. Or when you do, they are sophisticated enough that when deployed it is with a precision detail that makes collateral damage a defunct terminology. ADVERTISEMENT Wilson has been a career pilot for more than three decades, for country and corporation - he says: “I love doing my job, it’s a fabulous job and I’m in a position of huge trust and feel very honoured.” He is also a husband and father, and speaks with as much animation - if not more - about his teenage son’s skills with the guitar and in computing, as he does the experience of soaring alongside a Royal Navy carrier piloting one of the most prestigious and expensive bits of military kit on the planet. He is a person in the business, as he sees it, of protecting people. “That is my sole reason for doing this and I hate the thought we would ever have to deploy this to actually go out and kill people. But if someone is coming at us I’d far rather take out a few individuals if we could do that clinically and precisely without having any collateral damage at all. I'm ok to go that far. I'm not ok with the way it used to be in the early days of just ridiculous carpet bombing - that’s got to stop.” The F-35 simulator, and future iterations, are designed to help the Royal Navy and others get to that position of precision. It’s about mitigating the risks to the pilot and everyone on board a carrier. But also hopefully limiting the likelihood of the chaos usually associated with warfare. “Until you’ve done it, you don’t know quite how it’s going to go,” Wilson admits when discussing a specific manoeuvre (returning with an uneven load on the F-35). “So we have very good modelling, we go to the simulator, we train and we practice and we talk about it a lot in our meetings. We plan the test in intricate detail; we reduce the risk as much as we can but ultimately, when you go and do it for the first time, you've just got to suck it and see. There is some inherent risk in that, but we have become very good over the years at reducing that risk down to the minimum.” Video Technology Military Bae Systems F-35B Jets Share this article RECOMMENDED Inside Heathrow's third runway noise simulator Inside Heathrow's third runway noise simulator By James Temperton Noise Pollution 31 Mar 2015 A cyber war is being staged in central London A cyber war is being staged in central London By Emiko Jozuka Politics 13 Mar 2015 Gallery: A cyber war is being staged in central London Gallery: A cyber war is being staged in central London By Emiko Jozuka Politics 13 Mar 2015 Opinion: 'Secret Cinema: Star Wars' is a ripoff pantomime Opinion: 'Secret Cinema: Star Wars' is a ripoff pantomime By James Temperton James Temperton'S Blog 04 Jun 2015 Privacy policy and cookie statement Terms & conditions Careers Contact © Condé Nast UK 2017

The commercial sector's interest comes as many anticipate support from the Trump administration, which is eager for a first-term triumph to rally the nation the way the Apollo flights did in the late 1960s and early 1970s. The latest to offer a proposal is Jeffrey Bezos, whose space company Blue Origin has been circulating a seven-page white paper to NASA leadership and President Donald Trump's transition team about the company's interest in developing a lunar spacecraft with a lander that would touch down near a crater at the south pole where there is water and near continuous sunlight for solar energy. The memo urges the space agency to back an Amazon-like shipment service for the moon that would deliver gear for experiments, cargo and habitats by mid-2020, helping to enable "future human settlement" of the moon. (Bezos, the founder of Amazon.com, owns The Washington Post.) "It is time for America to return to the Moon-this time to stay," Bezos said in response to emailed questions from The Post. "A permanently inhabited lunar settlement is a difficult and worthy objective. I sense a lot of people are excited about this." The Post obtained a copy of the white paper, marked "proprietary and confidential," and the company then confirmed its authenticity and agreed to answer questions about it. Bezos' proposal comes as SpaceX founder Elon Musk made a stunning announcement this week that his company planned to fly two unnamed, private citizens on a tourist trip around the moon by next year-an ambitious timeline that, if met, could beat a similar mission by NASA. Anticipating that the Trump administration is focusing on the moon, the space agency recently announced it is considering adding astronauts to the first flight of its Space Launch System rocket and Orion crew capsule. That flight, originally scheduled to fly without humans in 2018, would also circle the moon. But as the space agency seeks to move faster under the Trump administration, it is now studying the feasibility of adding crew for a mission that would then occur by 2019. Obama killed plans for a lunar mission, saying in 2010 that "we've been there before." But the administration's Mars plan was still far from actually delivering humans there, and critics grew frustrated that NASA has not been able to fly humans out of low Earth orbit since the 1970s. A shot around the moon, however, could be feasible, even within a few years. Blue Origin's proposal -dated Jan. 4-doesn't involve flying humans, but rather is focused on a series of cargo missions. Those could deliver the equipment necessary to help establish a human colony on the moon-unlike the Apollo missions, in which the astronauts left "flags and footprints" and then came home. NASA already has shown a willingness to work closely with the commercial sector, hiring companies to fly supplies and eventually astronauts to the International Space Station. It is providing technical expertise, but no funding, as part of SpaceX's plan to fly an uncrewed spacecraft to Mars by 2020. The prospect of a lunar mission has several companies lining up to provide not just transportation, but also habitats, science experiments and even the ability to mine the moon for resources. The United Launch Alliance, the joint venture of Boeing and Lockheed Martin, has also been working on plans to create a transportation network to the area around the moon, known as cislunar space. "I'm excited by the possibilities," said Tory Bruno, ULA chief executive. "This administration, near as we can tell, feels a sense of urgency to go out and make things happen, and to have high-profile demonstrations that are along the roadmap to accomplish these broad goals. ...There is an opportunity to begin building that infrastructure right now-within the next four years." Robert Bigelow, the founder of Bigelow Aerospace, a maker of inflatable space habitats, said his company could create a depot that could orbit the moon by 2020, housing supplies and medial facilities, as well as humans. A smaller version of the possible habitats, known as the BEAM, is currently docked to the International Space Station, where astronauts have been testing it. In an interview, Bigelow said he was glad the administration seems to be refocuaing on the moon. "Mars is premature at this time. The moon is not," he said. "We have the technology. We have the ability, and the potential for a terrific business case." After remaining quiet and obsessively secretive for years, Blue Origin's attempt to partner with NASA is a huge coming out of sorts for the company, which has been funded almost exclusively by Bezos. The paper urges NASA to develop a program that provides "incentives to the private sector to demonstrate a commercial lunar cargo delivery service." Blue Origin could perform the first lunar mission as early as July, 2020, Bezos wrote, but stressed that it could "only be done in partnership with NASA. Our liquid hydrogen expertise and experience with precision vertical landing offer the fastest path to a lunar lander mission. I'm excited about this and am ready to invest my own money alongside NASA to make it happen." Last year, Blue Origin successfully launched and landed its suborbital rocket, the New Shepard, five times within less than a year, flying just past the 62-mile edge of space and then landing vertically on a landing pad at the company's west Texas facility. That same technology could be used to land the Blue Moon vehicle on the lunar surface, the company said. Its white paper shows what looks like a modified New Shepard rocket, standing on the moon with an American flag, a NASA logo and Blue Origin's feather symbol. The company said it plans to land its Blue Moon lunar lander at Shackleton Crater on the moon's south pole. The site has near continuous sunlight to provide power through the spacecraft's solar arrays. The company also chose to land there because of the "water ice in the perpetual shadow of the crater's deep crevices." Water is vital not just for human survival, but because hydrogen and oxygen in water could also be transformed into rocket fuel. The moon, then, is seen as a massive gas station in space. The Blue Moon spacecraft could carry as much as 10,000 pounds of material and fly atop several different rockets, including NASA's Space Launch System, the United Launch Alliance's Atlas V or its own New Glenn rocket, which is under development and expected to fly by the end of the decade, the company said. "Once on the surface, the lander's useful payload can be used to conduct science or deploy rovers," the company said. "A robotic arm attached to the lander will deploy to examine the lunar surface with an array of instruments." The initial landing "is envisioned as the first in a series of increasingly capable missions," including flying samples of lunar ice back to Earth for study. The company said it could also help deliver the cargo and supplies needed for human settlements. "Blue Moon is all about cost-effective delivery of mass to the surface of the Moon," Bezos wrote. "Any credible first lunar settlement will require that capability." (This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)

SHARE Global manufacturer buys GJ firm Seventy-five employees work at Lewis Engineering, 2790 H Road, which recently was acquired by a $20 billion international manufacturing services company. The name will change to Jabil Lewis Engineering, but the local management staff is to stay intact. Employees are to retain their positions. By Gary Harmon Thursday, March 2, 2017 A small, privately held Grand Junction company is now part of a global manufacturing-services corporation that sought out the smaller company for its expertise. Jabil Circuit Inc., NYSE: JBL, completed the asset purchase of Lewis Engineering on Wednesday in a transaction that Bill Frake, Jabil vice president for the defense and aerospace group, said will recognize the Grand Junction office at 2790 H Road as a global “center for excellence” for complex machining and related services. While there are custom machining sites scattered around the United States and, to a lesser extent, the world, “very few of them are as good as Lewis,” said Mark Fratoni, director of business development for defense and aerospace for St. Petersburg, Florida-based Jabil. The transaction opens new markets to the previously privately held Lewis while giving Jabil the ability to expand its global services, officials said. Lewis’ management, including founders Mark and Lakeo Lewis, and Matt Collins, chief operating officer, all will remain with the company. Terms of the transaction weren’t immediately disclosed. Passers-by might not notice any immediate changes except that of a different sign, but Jabil already has brought in some new equipment, which Frake noted will expand abilities at Lewis while demonstrating Jabil’s commitment to its new acquisition. A common customer brought Jabil’s attention to Lewis and Frake visited Grand Junction last summer. What Frake and Mark and Lakeo Lewis found was that their separate organizations and cultures would mesh because they were already similar. Lewis Engineering’s involvement in Colorado Mesa University and Western Colorado Community College, for instance, matched up with the kinds of involvement that Jabil encourages, Frake said. Much of the activity Jabil tries to bring to acquisitions “was already being done” at Lewis, Frake said. The cultural similarities were also clear to Lakeo Lewis, who said she was pleased to learn that the companies shared similar roots. “I said, ‘Wow, what a coincidence,’” when she learned that Jabil, like Lewis, was started in a garage and grew slowly over years, Lakeo Lewis said Thursday, calling the transaction “a perfect marriage.” Jabil — whose name derives from the names of its founders, James Golden and Bill Morean, who started the company in 1966 — is “the biggest company you never heard of,” Frake said. That’s largely because it provides services to manufacturers and is rarely recognized outside that circle. Aircraft from airliners to fighter jets, however, contain parts that Jabil supplied, or were made with Jabil-supplied machinery, Frake said. It’s possible that Jabil could make use of a foreign-trade zone, as is being contemplated by Grand Junction city officials and others, given that it does business globally, including with aircraft makers Boeing and Airbus, Frake said. While the transaction went forward without government involvement, officials with the Grand Junction Area Chamber of Commerce and Grand Junction Economic Partnership were looped in recently and put together a suite of incentives, including the possibility of participating in the Rural Jump-Start program, to cement the deal. The key attraction for Jabil, however, seems to be a combination of tangible and intangible assets at Lewis, Collins said. Lewis has a long-term lease on the building and a greater investment in the workforce there, many of whom have backgrounds from CMU or the community college, Collins said. “It’s the talent” already at Lewis that attracted Jabil, Collins said.

Jetlines' initial flights from Vancouver could be to Hamilton and Prince George, Jetlines executive chairman Mark Morabito said Thursday. The next set of routes out of Vancouver would then be places such as Reno, Nevada or Anchorage, Alaska. It remains unclear, however, when the ultra-low-cost carrier, which plans to charge fares that are an average of 40 per cent to 50 per cent less than Air Canada and WestJet, will get off the ground. "We'll fly when we're ready," Morabito said. "We're not going to promise we'll be flying by 'X' date. There's a very detailed process that's involved in getting an airline flying and we're going to follow it step by step." He said that Jetlines is in the process of completing its air-operator certificate and that he expects to have that certificate by the end of the summer. The airline also needs some additional capital and it expects to get that money from offshore investors. Transport Minister Marc Garneau last year approved an exemption so Jetlines could seek foreign investment that gave foreigners more than what was previously a maximum of a 25 per cent voting interest. The threshold that Garneau approved means that foreigners can have a 49 per cent voting interest in the airline. The airline, which will trade under the ticker symbol JET.WT.A, had originally planned to start with flights in Western Canada and then gradually expand to cities such as Winnipeg and Hamilton. Calgary, which is where WestJet Airlines Ltd. is based, is not expected to be on Jetlines' route map. Jetlines originally proposed in early 2014 to go public via a reverse takeover with Inovent Capital Inc. but then abruptly cancelled plans to link with Inovent, saying that it was exploring other financing opportunities. At that time it also placed an order, worth US$438 million, for five of Boeing's 737 MAX aircraft, which are to be delivered in 2021. Morabito said that when Jetlines starts flying, it will use two leased planes. The Boeing planes that it ordered years ago are still set to be delivered and Morabito said that he expects Jetlines to expand that order. Jetlines originally planned to launch in mid-2015 using leased planes. © Copyright 2017 Prince George Citizen 'Please support the Prince George Citizen and online news like this by purchasing a digital subscription.'

Photo: Reuters mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 1:00 PM, March 3, 2017 AVALON, Australia - Lockheed Martin Corp said on Friday it was talking to the governments of Spain, Switzerland and Belgium about selling its F-35 fighter jets to the European nations. Bringing new customers could help significantly reduce the cost of the military aircraft after several blowouts and production delays. The United States and 10 allies are clients of the F-35 currently. "We are talking to several other countries - Switzerland, Belgium, Spain," Jeff Babione, Lockheed Martin's F-35 program leader, told reporters at the Avalon Airshow in Australia. "There are quite a few other European nations that are looking at perhaps having the F-35 as an opportunity," Babione said. "We are starting to see other customers think about the F-35 being added to their fleet." Another person familiar with the discussions, who was not authorized to speak on the record, said that Finland was also in talks. Babione said that countries already signed up to the F-35 program along with the United States - Australia, Denmark, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Turkey, the United Kingdom, Japan, South Korea and Israel - need to start ordering in blocks beyond yearly commitments to help meet a reduced target cost of $80 million by 2020. "It is actually a very reasonable target but it is going to take cooperation in changing the way we buy the aircraft," he said. U.S. President Donald Trump has criticized the cost of the project. While the price per jet has steadily declined since the first jets were delivered to the U.S. military in 2011 as production has increased, it remains at $94.6 million. Lockheed is pressing purchasers to agree to a three-year block buy that would help reduce costs by bulk sourcing parts. "The longer we do it the more we are able to aggregate," Babione said. "Maybe in the future you are talking about a multi-year and you could do a five year multi-year and increase the savings." Babione also urged Canada to speed up a decision about whether it would buy the F-35s or Boeing Co's Super Hornets instead. The Pentagon's head of the F-35 program said earlier this week at Avalon that the overall reliability of the jets is being pulled down by initial versions of the aircraft which do not perform as well as more recently delivered jets. "Unfortunately today the aircraft reliability and maintainability of the airplane is what I would call flat," Lieutenant General Chris Bogdan of the U.S. Department of Defense said.
