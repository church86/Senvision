Continue Reading Below The grounding comes days before Boeing was due to deliver its first 737 MAX to an airline and marks a high-profile delay in a program that Boeing had said was ahead of schedule. It poses no safety concerns for travelers because no airlines are yet flying the 737 MAX but it could mean a costly disruption if the problem persists. Timely delivery is important to planemakers as they get most of the payment for a plane when it is handed to the buyer. Boeing and engine maker CFM said they do not know how long the delay will last. Boeing shares fell 1.3 percent to $183.15 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. GE shares were down 0.9 percent at $28.67. The 737 MAX replaces an older version of Boeing's best-selling single-aisle aircraft, a key moneymaker for the aerospace company. The 737 MAX 8, the first version of the plane to be built, seats 162 passengers in a typical two-class configuration. It carries a list price of $110 million but airlines typically receive steep discounts. Continue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT A delay in getting aircraft to customers likely would cause a build up in Boeing's inventory, "as planes essentially sit waiting for engines," said analyst Rob Stallard at Vertical Research Partners. "Investors are acutely focused" on the risks of speeding up production of the new engine, known as the LEAP-1B, he said. Separately, Airbus said it was continuing flights with its A320neo, which is powered by the similar LEAP-1A engine and is flying customers. Malaysian carrier Malindo Air was set to receive the first 737 MAX delivery on Monday and use the jet for its Kuala Lumpur-Singapore route from May 19. But Malindo CEO Chandran Rama Muthy told Reuters that it does not plan to use the plane until May 22, without elaborating on the reason for the delay. Norwegian Air Shuttle, which was due to receive its first 737 MAX near the end of May, said it expected a "a few days' delay." "This will, however, not delay the launch of our upcoming trans-Atlantic routes from the United States to Edinburgh,” spokesman Anders Lindstrom said in an email. Southwest Airlines, the initial customer for the 737 MAX, said Boeing had not warned it of any delays to its delivery schedule. Southwest is expected to begin receiving the jet later in the year after it retires some older 737s. American Airlines Group, which has 100 737 MAX jets on order, declined to comment. The issue arose late last week when Safran found a quality problem in a large metal disc used in the low-pressure turbine at the rear of the engine, said Jamie Jewell, a spokesman for the engine maker, CFM International. CFM notified Boeing, which immediately grounded the fleet of about 21 planes. GE spokesman Rick Kennedy said the disc that prompted the concern had not been installed in an engine. "There have been no issues whatsoever with engines in the field," Jewell said. All of the 30 to 40 engines that have been built so far will be sent either to Lafayette, Indiana, or Villaroche, France, for inspection, Kennedy said. Many will need to be removed from aircraft and shipped, Jewell said. It was not clear how long the inspections would take to complete. Safran received the disc from a supplier but there are other suppliers of that part so production of the engine was continuing, Kennedy said.   (Additional reporting by Alana Wise and A.

The stoppage came days before the US planemaker was due to make its first delivery of the aircraft to a customer. But Boeing said it was sticking with plans to begin MAX deliveries this month, adding that production of the jets would continue. American Airlines, Southwest, and China's Shandong Airlines are among those who have placed orders. Earlier this year Indian airline SpiceJet placed an order for 205 new planes from Boeing, in a deal valued around $22bn (£18bn). Boeing had said the first of the Max 737 planes would be delivered to SpiceJet in 2018. The MAX fleet is designed to be a more fuel-efficient version and replaces Boeing's previous 737 model which has been a best-seller for the aerospace giant. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Boeing 737 MAX 9 on its maiden flight in April Engine troubles? Boeing says it was notified last week of a potential issue involving turbine engine discs manufactured by a supplier to CFM International. CFM is the joint venture between US firm General Electric (GE) and French-based Safran - the companies making the engines for the 737 Max fleet. Boeing says it has not experienced any problems with the discs during more than 2,000 hours of testing. "Out of an abundance of caution, we decided to temporarily suspend MAX flights," it told the BBC. "The step is consistent with our priority focus on safety for all who use and fly our products." The 737 MAX 8, the first version of the plane to be built, carries a list price of $110m but airlines generally receive steep discounts. The next model, the 737 MAX 9, has more seating capacity. That aircraft completed a successful maiden flight last month. Sales and profits slipped at Boeing last year, mainly due to lower deliveries of its military aircraft. The US aerospace giant celebrated its 100th year in business last year.

Disney was the biggest loser in the blue-chip index, shedding 2.2 per cent on worries about its ESPN sports network, while Boeing fell 1.3 per cent on news it suspended flight tests of its new 737 plane because of engine problems. Analysts were surprised markets didn’t react more to the Comey firing, which has raised echoes of Watergate, the 1970s political scandal that ended Richard Nixon’s presidency. The FBI is investigating Russian ties to the White House, and Comey had reportedly asked for more funds to pursue the case. “The big story of the day really is the market is taking the Comey firing pretty well, considering it further decreases the prospects for tax reform, infrastructure spending, any sort of stimulus,” said Karl Haeling of LBBW. “To me, it’s one more confirmation that what’s driving the market is not really expectations for fiscal stimulus. It’s really driven more by earnings.” With declines in some major shares, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.2 per cent to close the session at 20,943.11. But the broad-based S&P 500 gained 0.1 per cent to 2,399.63, as did tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index which ended at 6,129.14, its fourth straight record close.

The jetmaker and its engine supplier, a venture of General Electric and Safran, are rushing to understand the problem ahead of the aircraft's first delivery, which remains scheduled for later this month. Boeing said a possible quality defect in the Leap engine's low-pressure turbine discs was discovered during inspections and hadn't affected flight testing of the upgraded 737. The grounding added to concerns about the strain on suppliers as the US manufacturer and European rival Airbus unveil new aircraft models while ramping up single-aisle production to record levels. Boeing is counting on a smooth start for the 737 Max, the newest version of a plane that is the company's largest source of profit, as it seeks to boost cash flow. Boeing shares fell 1.2 per cent to US$183.18 at the close in New York, the second-biggest decline on the Dow Jones Industrial Average, after adjusting for the beginning of trading without the right to a dividend. GE dropped 0.8 per cent to US$28.70. Get The Straits Times newsletters in your inbox Sign Up The Max has accumulated 3,714 orders before its commercial debut but is still racing to catch up to Airbus's A320neo. The latest 737 model is slated to be handed over this month to Malindo Air and Norwegian Air Shuttle. Other major customers with deliveries this year include Southwest Airlines and American Airlines Group. Malindo, an affiliate of Indonesian carrier PT Lion Mentari Airlines, didn't respond to an email seeking comment. It had expected to take the 737 Max early next week, advertising that commercial service would begin May 19. In 2012, Lion announced the signing of a US$22.4 billion order with Boeing. Other Asian customers for the Max include SpiceJet in India, Singapore-based lessor BOC Aviation, VietJet Aviation Joint Stock Co in Vietnam and the continent's biggest carrier China Southern Airlines. "This doesn't look like a serious concern," Cai von Rumohr, an analyst with Cowen & Co, said in a note to clients. The engine problem is "not a design shortfall but what appears to be an easily fixable sub-tier supplier component issue." Both CFM and rival Pratt & Whitney, which together make the bulk of engines for narrow-body commercial jets, have encountered faults as they've churned out turbines over the past year. Airbus has fallen behind in deliveries of its A320neo family of aircraft as Pratt's cutting-edge geared turbofan engine encounters durability issues and production snarls. Executives of Air Lease Corp, a Los Angeles-based aircraft lessor, warned during an earnings call last week that a CFM-powered model was also encountering delays. CFM faces a steep production increase for the Leap, as Boeing and Airbus plot to increase narrow-body production by 33 per cent through the decade's end. After delivering 77 of the engines last year, 28 fewer than it had predicted, CFM has targeted producing about 500 Leap this year and about 2,000 in 2020. "It's important that this gets straightened out pronto," Nicholas Heymann, an analyst at William Blair & Co, said of the engine issue. Bladed discs, located in the hot section of a turbofan engine, pull energy from the hot gases of the combustor to produce thrust. The components must be able to withstand extreme stresses and high temperatures inside the engine. The impact on airline customers eager to show off the brand-new planes wasn't immediately apparent. Boeing has several unaffected engines available that it could swap to avoid lengthy delays on initial deliveries, Alder said. For Norwegian, also awaiting its first Max this month, the inspections "will result in a few days' delay" but aren't expected to disrupt the carrier's new trans-Atlantic flights starting next month, spokesman Anders Lindstrom said in an email. The carrier had expected to take five more of the single-aisle planes in June. Southwest and American said they hadn't been notified of any changes to their Max delivery schedules. Southwest is the second-biggest customer for the Max after Lion Air, with 200 on order, while American has ordered 100 of the planes. On-time delivery of Southwest's Max planes is critical because the Dallas-based airline is counting on them to fill a gap when it retires its oldest aircraft on Oct 1. Southwest is set to take delivery of its first Max in July, the airline's chief financial officer said in January. American is scheduled to receive four Max aircraft this year, the first in the third quarter.

Disney, Boeing hit Dow; Nasdaq ends at another record Money Wednesday 10 May 2017 - 10:35pm File image of an Hawaiian Airlines Boeing 767 (N597HA) taking off. Photo: via Wikimedia Commons NEW YORK - Weakness in Boeing and Disney hit the Dow on Wednesday, but the Nasdaq edged to another record as investors digested -- and brushed off -- President Donald Trump's shock firing of FBI director James Comey. Disney was the biggest loser in the blue-chip index, shedding 2.2 percent on worries about its ESPN sports network, while Boeing fell 1.3 percent on news it suspended flight tests of its new 737 plane because of engine problems. Analysts were surprised markets didn't react more to the Comey firing, which has raised echoes of Watergate, the 1970s political scandal that ended Richard Nixon's presidency. The FBI is investigating Russian ties to the White House, and Comey had reportedly asked for more funds to pursue the case. "The big story of the day really is the market is taking the Comey firing pretty well, considering it further decreases the prospects for tax reform, infrastructure spending, any sort of stimulus," said Karl Haeling of LBBW. "To me, it's one more confirmation that what's driving the market is not really expectations for fiscal stimulus. It's really driven more by earnings." With declines in some major shares, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.2 percent to close the session at 20,943.11. But the broad-based S&P 500 gained 0.1 percent to 2,399.63, as did tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index which ended at 6,129.14, its fourth straight record close. Abercrombie & Fitch surged 12.2 percent following reports it is in talks with at least two companies on a possible takeover.  Organic grocery chain Whole Foods Market fell 0.9 on reports it plans to replace more than half of its 12 directors following pressure from activist fund Jana Partners.  Energy companies advanced as oil prices rose, with Dow member Chevron winning 1.4 percent, ConocoPhillips 2.9 percent and Halliburton 1.7 percent. Other companies with big share price moves after earnings reports included Electronic Arts, up 13.1 percent, Nvidia, up 17.8 percent, Priceline, down 4.5 percent and Yelp, down 18.4 percent.

ROS LBoard 1 PKR: Is UiTM’s event part of Umno celebration? Predeep Nambiar Read More FMT BAHASA FMT BORNEO+ FMT VIDEO CONTRIBUTE NEWS HOME NATION OPINION WORLD LEISURE SPORTS BUSINESS ADVERTISE WITH US Boeing suspends 737 MAX flights due to engine issue Reuters | May 11, 2017 The 737 MAX grounding will likely mean a delay for Malindo Air, a Malaysian carrier that had been expected to receive the first 737 MAX delivery as early as Monday. SEATTLE: Boeing Co said on Wednesday it had temporarily halted test flights of its new 737 MAX aircraft due to an issue with the engine, which is jointly made by General Electric Co and Safran SA of France. The grounding comes days before Boeing was due to deliver its first 737 MAX to an airline and marks a high-profile delay in a program that Boeing had said was ahead of schedule. It poses no safety concerns for travelers because no airlines are yet flying the 737 MAX but it could mean a costly disruption if the problem persists. Timely delivery is important to planemakers as they get most of the payment for a plane when it is handed to the buyer. Boeing and engine maker CFM said they do not know how long the delay will last. Boeing shares fell 1.3% to US$183.15 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. GE shares were down 0.9% at US$28.67. The 737 MAX replaces an older version of Boeing’s best-selling single-aisle aircraft, a key moneymaker for the aerospace company. The 737 MAX 8, the first version of the plane to be built, seats 162 passengers in a typical two-class configuration. It carries a list price of US$110 million but airlines typically receive steep discounts. A delay in getting aircraft to customers likely would cause a build up in Boeing’s inventory, “as planes essentially sit waiting for engines,” said analyst Rob Stallard at Vertical Research Partners. “Investors are acutely focused” on the risks of speeding up production of the new engine, known as the LEAP-1B, he said. Separately, Airbus said it was continuing flights with its A320neo, which is powered by the similar LEAP-1A engine and is flying customers. The 737 MAX grounding likely will mean a delay for Malindo Air, a Malaysian carrier that had been expected to receive the first 737 MAX delivery as early as Monday. Norwegian Air Shuttle ASA, which was due to receive its first 737 MAX near the end of May, said it expected a “a few days’ delay.” “This will, however, not delay the launch of our upcoming trans-Atlantic routes from the United States to Edinburgh,” spokesman Anders Lindstrom said in an email. Southwest Airlines Co, the initial customer for the 737 MAX, said Boeing had not warned it of any delays to its delivery schedule. Southwest is expected to begin receiving the jet later in the year after it retires some older 737s. American Airlines Group Inc, which has 100 737 MAX jets on order, declined to comment. The issue arose late last week when Safran found a quality problem in a large metal disc used in the low-pressure turbine at the rear of the engine, said Jamie Jewell, a spokesman for the engine maker, CFM International. CFM notified Boeing, which immediately grounded the fleet of about 21 planes. GE spokesman Rick Kennedy said the disc that prompted the concern had not been installed in an engine. “There have been no issues whatsoever with engines in the field,” Jewell said. All of the 30 to 40 engines that have been built so far will be sent either to Lafayette, Indiana, or Villaroche, France, for inspection, Kennedy said. Many will need to be removed from the aircraft and shipped, Jewell said. It was not clear how long the inspections would take to complete. Safran received the disc from a supplier but there are other suppliers of that part so production of the engine was continuing, Kennedy said.

A Monday afternoon report at Aviation Week sent shares of The Boeing Co. (NYSE: BA) down sharply. The company had suspended test flights of the new 737 MAX 8 (737-8) for several days following the discovery of cracks in a section of the CFM Leap-1B engines that power the new plane. The Leap-1B engine is built by CFM, a 50/50 joint venture between the General Electric Co. (NYSE: GE) and French engine maker Safran. The report also weighed on GE stock in Wednesday’s trading session. Boeing has been ahead of its schedule for first delivery of the 737-8. Originally due late in the second quarter or early in the third quarter of this year, Boeing expects to deliver the first plane by the end of this month to India’s Lion Air. According to Aviation Week, Boeing said the issue is a manufacturing quality control problem and is restricted to a specific batch of parts for the engine’s low-pressure turbine section, not a fundamental design flaw. Boeing and CFM say the issue is limited to fewer than 50 engines. CFM makes three variations of the Leap engine: the Leap-1A for the Airbus A320neo family; the Leap-1B for the Boeing 737 MAX family; and the Leap-1C for the Comac C919 passenger jet made in China. CFM expects to deliver more than 500 Leap engines in 2017, rising to 1,900 in 2018 and 2,000 in 2019. Each aircraft, no matter which manufacturer, uses two Leap engines for each aircraft. The test flights have been suspended for several days so far and are expected to resume soon. Boeing stock closed at $183.18 Wednesday, down 1.25% for the day in a 52-week range of $122.35 to $187.21. The consensus 12-month price target on the stock is $188.05. GE stock dropped 0.8% on Wednesday to close at $28.70 in a 52-week range of $28.19 to $33.00. The stock’s consensus price target is $32.57.

The company said Wednesday, May 10, 2017, it was notified of a potential manufacturing-quality issue by CFM, which makes the engines that are going on the Boeing 737 Max. (AP Photo/Elaine Thompson, File) DALLAS (AP) — Boeing is suspending test flights of a new airliner because of a possible problem in the manufacturing of a key engine part. The company said Wednesday that it still plans to deliver the first Boeing 737 Max later this month, and production will continue. The news sent Boeing Co. shares down nearly 4 percent, although they recovered partly to close at $183.18, down $2.31, or 1.3 percent. Chicago-based Boeing was notified last week of a potential issue involving turbine engine discs produced by a supplier to engine maker CFM International. Boeing said it has not experienced any problems with the discs during more than 2,000 hours of testing. The Max is designed to be a more fuel-efficient version of the workhorse 737, Boeing's most popular commercial plane. Malaysia's Malindo Air plans to take delivery of the first Max in a few days and begin using it for passenger flights before July. Dallas-based Southwest Airlines Co. expects to begin using the plane this fall. The discs in question are made by a supplier to CFM International, a joint venture of General Electric and France's Safran. GE spokeswoman Jamie Jewell declined to identify the supplier. She said GE and Safran will work with the supplier to find and correct any shortcomings in the manufacturing process while also turning to a backup supplier to keep production of engines on schedule. In a written statement, Boeing said it will work with CFM "to understand the precise scope and root cause of the quality issue." Get news headlines sent daily to your inbox Sign Up!

New planes and parts go through extensive testing to turn up problems before passengers go on board. Cai von Rumohr, an analyst with Cowen and Co., said "this doesn't look like a serious concern" because Boeing still expects to deliver the first plane this month and it appears to be a fixable manufacturing problem rather than a design flaw. Boeing has built about 9,500 single-aisle 737s since the late 1960s. The company said it has taken more than 3,700 orders for the Max, which carries a list price of $112.4 million to $119.2 million, although airlines routinely get big discounts. ___ David Koenig can be reached at http://twitter.com/airlinewriter Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.

Boeing shares fell 1.3 per cent to $183.15 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. GE shares were down 0.9 per cent at $28.67. Boeing said it still expects to deliver the first 737 MAX aircraft this month, and that production of both the MAX and current generation 737 will continue. Safran found a quality problem in a disc used in the low-pressure turbine at the rear of the engine and notified Boeing over the weekend, Rick Kennedy, a spokesman for GE, said. The 737 MAX replaces an older version of Boeing's best-selling single-aisle aircraft, a key moneymaker for the aerospace company. Kennedy said the disc that prompted the concern had not been installed in an engine, but the discovery prompted Boeing to halt flights until engines could be inspected. Safran received the disc from a supplier, but there are other suppliers of that part so production of the engine, known as the LEAP 1-B, was continuing, Kennedy said. American Airlines Group Inc, which has 100 737 MAX jets on order, declined to comment and referred questions to Boeing. Southwest Airlines Co , the launch customer for the new aircraft, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Disney was the biggest loser in the blue-chip index, shedding 2.2 per cent on worries about its ESPN sports network, while Boeing fell 1.3 per cent on news it suspended flight tests of its new 737 plane because of engine problems. Analysts were surprised markets didn't react more to the Comey firing, which has raised echoes of Watergate, the 1970s political scandal that ended Richard Nixon's presidency. The FBI is investigating Russian ties to the White House, and Comey had reportedly asked for more funds to pursue the case. "The big story of the day really is the market is taking the Comey firing pretty well, considering it further decreases the prospects for tax reform, infrastructure spending, any sort of stimulus," said Karl Haeling of LBBW.

But the broad-based S&P 500 gained 0.1 per cent to 2,399.63, as did tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index which ended at 6,129.14, its fourth straight record close.

The company is working with engine maker CFM to investigate.

The company said Wednesday it was notified of a potential manufacturing-quality issue by CFM, which makes the engines for the Boeing 737 Max. Boeing Co. said it has not experienced any issues with the low-pressure turbine discs during test flights. The company said it still plans to begin deliveries of the plane later this month, and production will continue. Bombardier faces lengthy legal battle with Boeing that could hurt CSeries sales Bombardier rejects Boeing claim CSeries was dumped into the U.S. at below cost The Max is designed to be a more fuel-efficient version of the workhorse 737, Boeing's most popular commercial plane. Malaysia's Malindo Air plans to be the first airline to fly the new plane, starting before July. Dallas-based Southwest Airlines Co. expects to begin using the plane for passenger flights this fall. Seattle-based Boeing said it has put CFM's Leap 1B engines through more than 2,000 hours of testing, including flights lasting more than nine hours, and additional tests that simulated 3,000 takeoffs and landings, and did not see any problems with the low-pressure turbine discs. The discs are made by a supplier to CFM International, a joint venture of General Electric and France's Safran. "CFM and its supplier notified us after discovering the issue as a part of their quality inspection process," a Boeing spokesman said in a written statement. "We will work closely with CFM to understand the precise scope and root cause of the quality issue." WestJet orders 65 new Boeing 737 MAX jets Air Canada orders 61 Boeing 737 MAX jets New planes and parts go through extensive testing to turn up problems before passengers go on board. Cai von Rumohr, an analyst with Cowen and Co., said "this doesn't look like a serious concern" because Boeing still expects to deliver the first plane this month and it appears to be a fixable manufacturing problem rather than a design flaw. © The Associated Press, 2017 Report Typo or Error Send Feedback Latest Business Headlines U.S. likely to expand airline laptop ban to include some European countries May 10, 8:37 PM ET King canola, fewer cows, aging producers: Digging into the agriculture census May 10, 6:57 PM ET Oh, Snap!: Shares in Snapchat owner plunge after disappointing earnings report May 10, 5:27 PM ET read comments audio Air Canada and WestJet score poorly on ranking of airline customer satisfaction May 10, 3:45 PM ET read comments CP Rail shifts focus from acquisitions to fixing labour strife May 10, 2:47 PM ET read comments video Must Watch Video Governance concerns 7:17 Richard LeBlanc, associate professor of governance law and ethics at York University, on Bombardier's dual-class share structure Video The Ticker 9:43 Marvin Ryder of McMaster University on some of the day's top stories.

Boeing stops test flights of its new 737 model because of a possible problem in engine discs. The company is working with engine maker CFM to investigate. The company said Wednesday, May 10, 2017, it was notified of a potential manufacturing-quality issue by CFM, which makes the engines that are going on the Boeing 737 Max. (AP Photo/Elaine Thompson, File) .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... DEVELOPING STORY — This story will be updated as new information becomes available. DALLAS — Boeing is suspending test flights of a new airliner because of a possible problem in the manufacturing of a key engine part. The company said Wednesday that it still plans to deliver the first Boeing 737 Max later this month, and production will continue. The news sent Boeing Co. shares down nearly 4 percent, although they recovered partly to close at $183.18, down $2.31, or 1.3 percent. Advertisement Continue reading Chicago-based Boeing was notified last week of a potential issue involving turbine engine discs produced by a supplier to engine maker CFM International. Boeing said it has not experienced any problems with the discs during more than 2,000 hours of testing. The Max is designed to be a more fuel-efficient version of the workhorse 737, Boeing’s most popular commercial plane. Malaysia’s Malindo Air plans to take delivery of the first Max in a few days and begin using it for passenger flights before July. Dallas-based Southwest Airlines Co. expects to begin using the plane this fall. The discs in question are made by a supplier to CFM International, a joint venture of General Electric and France’s Safran. GE spokeswoman Jamie Jewell declined to identify the supplier. She said GE and Safran will work with the supplier to find and correct any shortcomings in the manufacturing process while also turning to a backup supplier to keep production of engines on schedule. In a written statement, Boeing said it will work with CFM “to understand the precise scope and root cause of the quality issue.” New planes and parts go through extensive testing to turn up problems before passengers go on board. Cai von Rumohr, an analyst with Cowen and Co., said “this doesn’t look like a serious concern” because Boeing still expects to deliver the first plane this month and it appears to be a fixable manufacturing problem rather than a design flaw. Boeing has built about 9,500 single-aisle 737s since the late 1960s. The company said it has taken more than 3,700 orders for the Max, which carries a list price of $112.4 million to $119.2 million, although airlines routinely get big discounts. ___ David Koenig can be reached at http://twitter.com/airlinewriter Share Tweet LinkedIn Email Print Subscribe More News Most Recent Biz News Technology Suggested Stories: Southwest Unveils Larger 737-800 Planes – Mar 22, 2012 Boeing posts rare quarterly loss, mulls phasing out 747 – Jul 27, 2016 Boeing signs $3B deal with Iran airline, a first under Trump – Apr 4, 2017 1st large Chinese-made passenger jet makes its maiden flight – May 5, 2017 Advertisement Load comments Comments Subscribe to the Journal for only $12.

Boeing Related Media Gallery: Boeing 737 MAX 9 takes flight Advertisement Boeing has suspended 737 MAX flights after being informed by CFM International of a potential issue with the aircraft’s LEAP-1B engine, although Boeing says MAX 8 deliveries will begin this month as planned. “CFM has notified us of a potential manufacturing quality escape with low pressure turbine (LPT) discs in LEAP-1B engines delivered to Boeing,” Boeing said in a statement. “We are working with CFM to inspect the discs in question. CFM and its supplier notified us after discovering the issue as a part of their quality inspection process. At no time have we experienced an issue associated with the LPT during our ongoing MAX testing program.” Boeing said the decision to suspend MAX flights was made “out of an abundance of caution.” The suspension comes just as Boeing was preparing to begin delivery the 737 MAX 8, which was certified in March, to airlines. Malaysia’s Malindo Air is expected to receive the first delivery. The aircraft is also expected to enter service this summer with Norwegian. “Our plan remains to begin MAX deliveries in May,” Boeing said, adding that there will be no halt in MAX production or in production and deliveries of 737NG aircraft. The suspension also comes less than a month after the 737 MAX 9 achieved first flight. Boeing emphasized that it has had no problems associated with the LEAP-1B in flight testing. “The MAX 8 flight test program put over 2,000 hours on the engines, including abuse testing and flights lasting over 9 hr., undergoing thorough inspections throughout,” Boeing stated. “Additionally, 180-minute ETOPS testing completed in April 2017 required another 3,000 simulated flight cycles on the test stand before a complete inspection was conducted by CFM. The LEAP-1B and 737 MAX [8] have been certified to the most stringent requirements in commercial aviation.” A CFM spokesperson noted the potential issue was not discovered in flight testing or on any aircraft out in the field, but during a quality inspection in the factory, and the decision to suspend flights was made out of caution. CFM is a GE Aviation/Safran Aircraft Engines joint venture.  The spokesperson added that CFM has two suppliers for the LPTs used on the LEAP-1B, and the potential issue is only with one supplier’s LPT. The CFM LEAP-1A engine powering Airbus A320neo family aircraft is not affected by the potential issue.

The plane maker has concerns about a manufacturing quality issue inside the jet’s new engines. “Out of an abundance of caution, we decided to temporarily suspend MAX flights. The step is consistent with our priority focus on safety for all who use and fly our products,” the plane maker said in a statement. The jet has not yet been delivered to airlines. The first delivery was expected to be this month. Boeing said it plans to stick to that schedule. Boeing said in a statement it is inspecting the core of each advanced Leap-1B engine. The engines are made by CFM International, which is a joint venture between General Electric and France’s Safran. The affected multi-million dollar engines will be sent from Washington state back to manufacturing sites in Indiana and France for inspection, said Jamie Jewell, spokeswoman for CFM. Since the suspected components have two different suppliers, the issue doesn’t affect all of these engines. CFM said it will conduct inspections to determine how many jets are impacted. That means that Boeing should be able to make its first 737 Max delivery, which is slated to go to a Malaysian low-cost carrier later this month, but puts the schedule of future deliveries at risk. Norwegian Air Shuttle is slated to be one of the first airlines to fly passengers on the 737 Max — and the low-cost carrier has bet its future on flying across the Atlantic with it. “We know that [the grounding] will result in a few days delay of the first Max delivery to Norwegian,” said a spokesman, but the airline still plans to debut the jet on June 15. Boeing said the grounding has also halted aerial tests of the 737 Max 9, the second of four currently planned models. That jet made its maiden test flight in April. Shares of Boeing and GE fell sharply on news of the grounding, but recovered and closed only slightly lower. The updated 737 Max jet is expected to become Boeing’s biggest cash cow as it ramps up production to record levels in the coming years. This is the fourth generation of Boeing’s popular single-aisle jet, which has been a workhorse on short and medium haul flights for decades. The jet is 14% more fuel efficient than its predecessor, primarily due to its new engines. Jewell said that CFM’s inspections last week found “some anomalies in the process” of manufacturing disks for the jet’s turbine. Jewell stressed that there have been no problems related to the part in the more than 2,000 hours of test flights for the 737 Max. Boeing has more than 3,700 orders for the 737 Max, which has a sticker price of between $112.4 million and $119.2 million. Buyers typically get significant discounts.

Picture taken May 9, 2017. REUTERS/Jason Redmond 10/10 By Alwyn Scott | SEATTLE SEATTLE Boeing Co (BA.N) said on Wednesday it had temporarily halted test flights of its new 737 MAX aircraft due to an issue with the engine, which is jointly made by General Electric Co (GE.N) and Safran SA (SAF.PA) of France. The grounding comes days before Boeing was due to deliver its first 737 MAX to an airline and marks a high-profile delay in a program that Boeing had said was ahead of schedule. It poses no safety concerns for travelers because no airlines are yet flying the 737 MAX but it could mean a costly disruption if the problem persists. Timely delivery is important to planemakers as they get most of the payment for a plane when it is handed to the buyer. Boeing and engine maker CFM said they do not know how long the delay will last. Boeing shares fell 1.3 percent to $183.15 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. GE shares were down 0.9 percent at $28.67. The 737 MAX replaces an older version of Boeing's best-selling single-aisle aircraft, a key moneymaker for the aerospace company. The 737 MAX 8, the first version of the plane to be built, seats 162 passengers in a typical two-class configuration. It carries a list price of $110 million but airlines typically receive steep discounts. A delay in getting aircraft to customers likely would cause a build up in Boeing's inventory, "as planes essentially sit waiting for engines," said analyst Rob Stallard at Vertical Research Partners. "Investors are acutely focused" on the risks of speeding up production of the new engine, known as the LEAP-1B, he said. Separately, Airbus said it was continuing flights with its A320neo, which is powered by the similar LEAP-1A engine and is flying customers. Malaysian carrier Malindo Air was set to receive the first 737 MAX delivery on Monday and use the jet for its Kuala Lumpur-Singapore route from May 19. But Malindo CEO Chandran Rama Muthy told Reuters that it does not plan to use the plane until May 22, without elaborating on the reason for the delay. Norwegian Air Shuttle ASA (NWC.OL), which was due to receive its first 737 MAX near the end of May, said it expected a "a few days' delay." "This will, however, not delay the launch of our upcoming trans-Atlantic routes from the United States to Edinburgh,” spokesman Anders Lindstrom said in an email. Southwest Airlines Co (LUV.N), the initial customer for the 737 MAX, said Boeing had not warned it of any delays to its delivery schedule. Southwest is expected to begin receiving the jet later in the year after it retires some older 737s. American Airlines Group Inc (AAL.O), which has 100 737 MAX jets on order, declined to comment. The issue arose late last week when Safran found a quality problem in a large metal disc used in the low-pressure turbine at the rear of the engine, said Jamie Jewell, a spokesman for the engine maker, CFM International. CFM notified Boeing, which immediately grounded the fleet of about 21 planes. GE spokesman Rick Kennedy said the disc that prompted the concern had not been installed in an engine. "There have been no issues whatsoever with engines in the field," Jewell said. All of the 30 to 40 engines that have been built so far will be sent either to Lafayette, Indiana, or Villaroche, France, for inspection, Kennedy said. Many will need to be removed from aircraft and shipped, Jewell said. It was not clear how long the inspections would take to complete. Safran received the disc from a supplier but there are other suppliers of that part so production of the engine was continuing, Kennedy said. (Additional reporting by Alana Wise and A.

The plane is powered by Leap engines made by CFM International, a 50-50 joint venture between General Electric and France's Safran. Boeing shares dropped on the news, but regained some ground. Jeff Daniels | @jeffdanielsca 12 Hours AgoCNBC.com SHARES show chapters More turbulence ahead for airlines?    9 Hours Ago | 03:55 Boeing on Wednesday temporarily suspended flights of its 737 Max narrow-body jetliners due to an engine problem. The plane is powered by Leap engines made by CFM International, a 50-50 joint venture between General Electric and France's Safran. The Boeing aircraft has been undergoing test flights for a number of months and is close to its first commercial deliveries. "CFM notified us of a potential manufacturing quality escape with low pressure turbine disks in LEAP-1B engines delivered to Boeing," the aerospace giant said in a statement. Added Boeing, "We are working with CFM to inspect the disks in question." Boeing shares on Wednesday closed down 1.2 percent to $183.18. Earlier, the stock dropped as low as $177.18. GE's stock ended down modestly. "If the engine issue is indeed a quality issue and not a design issue, then it is likely to have a minimal impact to BA," Richard Safran, an industry analyst at Buckingham Research said in a research note. "It is also not likely to affect first delivery of the 737 Max or the production ramp." CFM has been the sole engine supplier to the Boeing 737 aircraft models since the early 1980s. Last month, CFM said more than 7,400 Leap-1B engines had been ordered to power the 3,700 Max aircraft by 86 customers worldwide. "Out of an abundance of caution, we decided to temporarily suspend MAX flights," Boeing said. "The step is consistent with our priority focus on safety for all who use and fly our products." GE Aviation and Safran confirmed in a statement that CFM notified Boeing of the engine issue. "We discovered the issue as part of our quality inspection process and notified Boeing immediately," the statement said. Boeing said the 737 Max 8 flight test program has put in more than 2,000 hours on the aircraft's engines. It also said the company still plans to begin first deliveries of the Max in May. The 737 Max 8 is the first of three planned models of Boeing's 737 Max line. The others include the Max 9, with just two test airplanes built so far, and the Max 7, a version that has yet to start production.

(AP) Comments Share Tweet Share Share Boeing has temporarily grounded all 737 MAX planes for an engine check. RELATED: Big 737 order is good news for Boeing The manufacturer of the engines for 737 MAX says there might be a quality-control issue, KIRO Radio’s Chris Sullivan reports. The company is grounding its fleet temporarily as it tests engines. Boeing says it has never had problems during test flights. “[The manufacturer] has notified us of a potential manufacturing quality escape with low-pressure turbine discs in LEAP 1B engines delivered to Boeing,” a spokesperson for Boeing said. “We are working with [the manufacturer] to inspect the discs in question. “Out of an abundance of caution, we decided to temporarily suspend MAX flights. The step is consistent with our priority focus on safety for all who use and fly our products.” The 737 MAX has not entered service. Boeing says first delivery is on schedule for later this month. The MAX 8 flight test program put more than 2,000 hours on the engines, including abuse testing and flights lasting more than nine hours.

  Home U.K. News Sports U.S. Showbiz Australia Femail Health Science Money Video Travel Columnists Wires Home My Profile Logout Login Feedback NEW ARTICLESHomeTop Share show ad Boeing suspends 737 MAX flights due to engine issue By Reuters Published: 15:12 EDT, 10 May 2017 | Updated: 17:37 EDT, 10 May 2017 e-mail By Alwyn Scott SEATTLE, May 10 (Reuters) - Boeing Co said on Wednesday it had temporarily halted test flights of its new 737 MAX aircraft due to an issue with the engine, which is jointly made by General Electric Co and Safran SA of France. The grounding comes days before Boeing was due to deliver its first 737 MAX to an airline and marks a high-profile delay in a program that Boeing had said was ahead of schedule. It poses no safety concerns for travelers because no airlines are yet flying the 737 MAX but it could mean a costly disruption if the problem persists. Timely delivery is important to planemakers as they get most of the payment for a plane when it is handed to the buyer. Boeing and engine maker CFM said they do not know how long the delay will last. Boeing shares fell 1.3 percent to $183.15 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. GE shares were down 0.9 percent at $28.67. The 737 MAX replaces an older version of Boeing's best-selling single-aisle aircraft, a key moneymaker for the aerospace company. The 737 MAX 8, the first version of the plane to be built, seats 162 passengers in a typical two-class configuration. It carries a list price of $110 million but airlines typically receive steep discounts. A delay in getting aircraft to customers likely would cause a build up in Boeing's inventory, "as planes essentially sit waiting for engines," said analyst Rob Stallard at Vertical Research Partners. "Investors are acutely focused" on the risks of speeding up production of the new engine, known as the LEAP-1B, he said. Separately, Airbus said it was continuing flights with its A320neo, which is powered by the similar LEAP-1A engine and is flying customers. The 737 MAX grounding likely will mean a delay for Malindo Air, a Malaysian carrier that had been expected to receive the first 737 MAX delivery as early as Monday. Norwegian Air Shuttle ASA, which was due to receive its first 737 MAX near the end of May, said it expected a "a few days' delay." "This will, however, not delay the launch of our upcoming trans-Atlantic routes from the United States to Edinburgh," spokesman Anders Lindstrom said in an email. Southwest Airlines Co, the initial customer for the 737 MAX, said Boeing had not warned it of any delays to its delivery schedule. Southwest is expected to begin receiving the jet later in the year after it retires some older 737s. American Airlines Group Inc, which has 100 737 MAX jets on order, declined to comment. The issue arose late last week when Safran found a quality problem in a large metal disc used in the low-pressure turbine at the rear of the engine, said Jamie Jewell, a spokesman for the engine maker, CFM International. CFM notified Boeing, which immediately grounded the fleet of about 21 planes. GE spokesman Rick Kennedy said the disc that prompted the concern had not been installed in an engine. "There have been no issues whatsoever with engines in the field," Jewell said. All of the 30 to 40 engines that have been built so far will be sent either to Lafayette, Indiana, or Villaroche, France, for inspection, Kennedy said. Many will need to be removed from aircraft and shipped, Jewell said. It was not clear how long the inspections would take to complete. Safran received the disc from a supplier but there are other suppliers of that part so production of the engine was continuing, Kennedy said.

During flight testing at Nellis Air Force Base, Nev., Talon HATE pods on two F-15C aircraft enabled test pilots to share information through the military’s Link 16, Common Data Link and Wideband Global SATCOM satellites. The tests also validated intra-flight datalink network capabilities used by F-22 aircraft. Pilots using the system can transmit information quickly between the F-15C and other Air Force aircraft and weapon systems, enabling efficient information sharing in real time. “We’ve completed developmental flight test,” said Lt. Col. Christopher Bradley, Air Force Talon HATE manager. “We look forward to fielding this system, not only to immediately provide aircrews with actionable information faster and at a higher quality, but also to help the Air Force learn important lessons for the employment of tactical gateway systems in the future.” “This aerial network is a giant leap forward in tactical fighter capability with real-time connectivity and expanded information sharing,” said Paul Geery, vice president, Phantom Works Mission Solutions and Boeing’s Talon HATE program manager. “We are now demonstrating secure datalink connections between F-15Cs and F-22s in a way that integrates information for the pilot into a common operating picture.” Boeing will conduct additional tests later this year with advanced sensors, which will offer improved aircraft targeting capabilities.

All of the new routes will be flown on 76-seat Embraer E175 jets operated by Alaska Airlines’ regional affiliates.  The San Diego news comes just a week after Alaska Airlines announced 13 new routes from two San Francisco Bay Area airports in what the company described as the “single largest new market announcement” in its history. Major expansion: Alaska Air adds 13 routes from Bay Area It also continues Alaska Air's moves to further beef up its presence in California, where it had already become a dominant player after its acquisition of San Francisco-based Virgin America.   That deal closed in December, immediately making Alaska Air one of the biggest carriers both in California and all along the West Coast. Alaska Air already operated hubs in Seattle and Portland, Ore., and had a sizable presence at several California airports, including Los Angeles, San Diego and San Jose. With Virgin America, Alaska Airlines gains access to that carrier’s hubs in San Francisco and Los Angeles. Additionally, Alaska Airlines has been building up its own presence across California, furthering growth in existing bases like Los Angeles and San Diego while bulking up its schedules at smaller stations like Burbank and Orange County. For now, Alaska Airlines and Virgin America will continue to operate under their own brands. Alaska Air CEO Brad Tilden has previously said the company is considering whether to continue that set-up or whether to fold the airlines into a single brand. It’s not clear when a decision might be reached.

During the one-hour flight, lead T-X Test Pilot Steve Schmidt and Boeing Test Pilot for Air Force Programs Matt Giese validated key aspects of the aircraft and further demonstrated the low-risk and performance of the design, proving its repeatability in manufacturing. “The jet handled exactly like the first aircraft and the simulator, meeting all expectations,” said Giese. “The front and back cockpits work together seamlessly and the handling is superior. It’s the perfect aircraft for training future generations of combat pilots.” Both pilots trained for the flight using the complete Boeing T-X system, which includes ground-based training and simulation. “Our successful flight test program is a testament to the fact that our offering is the right choice for the U.S. Air Force,” said Schmidt. “This aircraft was built to Air Force requirements and designed to fulfill the Air Education and Training Command mission.” The Boeing T-X aircraft has one engine, twin tails, stadium seating, and an advanced cockpit with embedded training. The all-new, purpose-built design offers flexibility to evolve as technology, missions, and training needs change. Boeing and Saab revealed their design in September 2016 and flew the first aircraft last December. T-X will replace the Air Force’s aging T-38 aircraft. Initial operating capability is planned for 2024. See other recent news regarding: Boeing, Saab, T-X.

By Ben Levisohn May 10, 2017 3:51 p.m. ET Text Size Regular Medium Large Shares of Boeing (BA) are dropping this afternoon after engine problems forced the airline maker to halt test flights of its 737 MAX jets. But Boeing wasn't the only stock getting dinged, as General Electric (GE), which manufactures said engines, also fell. CNBC's Jeff Daniels discusses General Electric's role in the suspension: Boeing on Wednesday temporarily suspended flights of its 737 MAX narrow-body jetliners due to an engine problem. The plane is powered by LEAP engines made by CFM International, a 50/50 joint venture between General Electric and France's Safran. CNBC reached out to GE and Safran for comment. "CFM notified us of a potential manufacturing quality escape with low pressure turbine disks in LEAP-1B engines delivered to Boeing," the aerospace giant said in a statement. Vertical Research's Robert Stallard and team consider the impact of the delay on Boeing: Boeing has reportedly halted 737 MAX test flights for engine inspections after the discovery of cracks in the low pressure turbine section. Following comments from Air Lease (AL) that LEAP powered A320 NEO deliveries are also behind schedule, this is the second report of potential problems on the LEAP engine for Airbus and Boeing's re-engined narrowbody aircraft... Details are still light at this stage, and although Boeing has reportedly stated that first deliveries remain on track, investors are acutely focused on 737 MAX ramp risk - and the impact on cash. The impact of these reported engine issues could turn out to be limited, as the LEAP is flying as planned on the A320 NEO, but given the GTF's problems on the NEO we can understand why this news might be taken badly be investors. Shares of Boeing have fallen 1.3% to $183.12 at 3:48 p.m. today, while General Electric has declined 0.9% to $28.67, and Air Lease is off 1.6% at $34.88.

A CFM spokesperson said the LEAP-1B engines used in the MAX would be inspected at General Electric in Indiana or Safran in France. GE and Safran are joint venture partners in CFM International. The engine turbine part found to have the problem is manufactured by more than one company and delivery delays are not expected to last long. The smallest member of the updated 737 family, the MAX 8, was due to be delivered to Malindo Air this month, but that is now expected to be delayed. Norwegian Air, another customer due for its first delivery in May said it expects a delay of a few days. The MAX 8 received FAA certification in March, clearing it for commercial service. Boeing had taken orders for 3,714 737 MAX aircraft by the end of April.

Picture taken May 9, 2017. REUTERS/Jason Redmond 10/10 By Alwyn Scott | SEATTLE SEATTLE Boeing Co (BA.N) said on Wednesday it had temporarily halted test flights of its new 737 MAX aircraft due to an issue with the engine, which is jointly made by General Electric Co (GE.N) and Safran SA (SAF.PA) of France. The grounding comes days before Boeing was due to deliver its first 737 MAX to an airline and marks a high-profile delay in a program that Boeing had said was ahead of schedule. It poses no safety concerns for travelers because no airlines are yet flying the 737 MAX but it could mean a costly disruption if the problem persists. Timely delivery is important to planemakers as they get most of the payment for a plane when it is handed to the buyer. Boeing and engine maker CFM said they do not know how long the delay will last. Boeing shares fell 1.3 percent to $183.15 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. GE shares were down 0.9 percent at $28.67. The 737 MAX replaces an older version of Boeing's best-selling single-aisle aircraft, a key moneymaker for the aerospace company. The 737 MAX 8, the first version of the plane to be built, seats 162 passengers in a typical two-class configuration. It carries a list price of $110 million but airlines typically receive steep discounts. A delay in getting aircraft to customers likely would cause a build up in Boeing's inventory, "as planes essentially sit waiting for engines," said analyst Rob Stallard at Vertical Research Partners. "Investors are acutely focused" on the risks of speeding up production of the new engine, known as the LEAP-1B, he said. Separately, Airbus said it was continuing flights with its A320neo, which is powered by the similar LEAP-1A engine and is flying customers. Malaysian carrier Malindo Air was set to receive the first 737 MAX delivery on Monday and use the jet for its Kuala Lumpur-Singapore route from May 19. But Malindo CEO Chandran Rama Muthy told Reuters that it does not plan to use the plane until May 22, without elaborating on the reason for the delay. Norwegian Air Shuttle ASA (NWC.OL), which was due to receive its first 737 MAX near the end of May, said it expected a "a few days' delay." "This will, however, not delay the launch of our upcoming trans-Atlantic routes from the United States to Edinburgh,” spokesman Anders Lindstrom said in an email. Southwest Airlines Co (LUV.N), the initial customer for the 737 MAX, said Boeing had not warned it of any delays to its delivery schedule. Southwest is expected to begin receiving the jet later in the year after it retires some older 737s. American Airlines Group Inc (AAL.O), which has 100 737 MAX jets on order, declined to comment. The issue arose late last week when Safran found a quality problem in a large metal disc used in the low-pressure turbine at the rear of the engine, said Jamie Jewell, a spokesman for the engine maker, CFM International. CFM notified Boeing, which immediately grounded the fleet of about 21 planes. GE spokesman Rick Kennedy said the disc that prompted the concern had not been installed in an engine. "There have been no issues whatsoever with engines in the field," Jewell said. All of the 30 to 40 engines that have been built so far will be sent either to Lafayette, Indiana, or Villaroche, France, for inspection, Kennedy said. Many will need to be removed from aircraft and shipped, Jewell said. It was not clear how long the inspections would take to complete. Safran received the disc from a supplier but there are other suppliers of that part so production of the engine was continuing, Kennedy said. (Additional reporting by Alana Wise and A.

The grounding comes days before Boeing was due to deliver its first 737 MAX to an airline and marks a high-profile delay in a program that Boeing had said was ahead of schedule. It poses no safety concerns for travelers because no airlines are yet flying the 737 MAX but it could mean a costly disruption if the problem persists. Timely delivery is important to planemakers as they get most of the payment for a plane when it is handed to the buyer. Boeing and engine maker CFM said they do not know how long the delay will last. Boeing shares fell 1.3 percent to $183.15 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. GE shares were down 0.9 percent at $28.67. The 737 MAX replaces an older version of Boeing's best-selling single-aisle aircraft, a key moneymaker for the aerospace company. The 737 MAX 8, the first version of the plane to be built, seats 162 passengers in a typical two-class configuration. It carries a list price of $110 million but airlines typically receive steep discounts. A delay in getting aircraft to customers likely would cause a build up in Boeing's inventory, "as planes essentially sit waiting for engines," said analyst Rob Stallard at Vertical Research Partners. "Investors are acutely focused" on the risks of speeding up production of the new engine, known as the LEAP-1B, he said. Separately, Airbus said it was continuing flights with its A320neo, which is powered by the similar LEAP-1A engine and is flying customers. The 737 MAX grounding likely will mean a delay for Malindo Air, a Malaysian carrier that had been expected to receive the first 737 MAX delivery as early as Monday. Norwegian Air Shuttle ASA, which was due to receive its first 737 MAX near the end of May, said it expected a "a few days' delay." "This will, however, not delay the launch of our upcoming trans-Atlantic routes from the United States to Edinburgh," spokesman Anders Lindstrom said in an email. Southwest Airlines Co, the initial customer for the 737 MAX, said Boeing had not warned it of any delays to its delivery schedule. Southwest is expected to begin receiving the jet later in the year after it retires some older 737s. American Airlines Group Inc, which has 100 737 MAX jets on order, declined to comment. The issue arose late last week when Safran found a quality problem in a large metal disc used in the low-pressure turbine at the rear of the engine, said Jamie Jewell, a spokesman for the engine maker, CFM International. CFM notified Boeing, which immediately grounded the fleet of about 21 planes. GE spokesman Rick Kennedy said the disc that prompted the concern had not been installed in an engine. "There have been no issues whatsoever with engines in the field," Jewell said. All of the 30 to 40 engines that have been built so far will be sent either to Lafayette, Indiana, or Villaroche, France, for inspection, Kennedy said. Many will need to be removed from aircraft and shipped, Jewell said. It was not clear how long the inspections would take to complete. Safran received the disc from a supplier but there are other suppliers of that part so production of the engine was continuing, Kennedy said.

(File photo) Boeing Co said on Wednesday it had temporarily halted test flights of its new 737 MAX aircraft due to an issue with the engine, which is jointly made by General Electric Co and Safran SA of France. The grounding comes days before Boeing was due to deliver its first 737 MAX to an airline and marks a high-profile delay in a program that Boeing had said was ahead of schedule. It poses no safety concerns for travelers because no airlines are yet flying the 737 MAX but it could mean a costly disruption if the problem persists. Timely delivery is important to planemakers as they get most of the payment for a plane when it is handed to the buyer. Boeing and engine maker CFM said they do not know how long the delay will last. Boeing shares fell 1.3 percent to $183.15 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. GE shares were down 0.9 percent at $28.67. The 737 MAX replaces an older version of Boeing’s best-selling single-aisle aircraft, a key moneymaker for the aerospace company. The 737 MAX 8, the first version of the plane to be built, seats 162 passengers in a typical two-class configuration. It carries a list price of $110 million but airlines typically receive steep discounts. A delay in getting aircraft to customers likely would cause a build up in Boeing’s inventory, “as planes essentially sit waiting for engines,” said analyst Rob Stallard at Vertical Research Partners. “Investors are acutely focused” on the risks of speeding up production of the new engine, known as the LEAP-1B, he said. Separately, Airbus said it was continuing flights with its A320neo, which is powered by the similar LEAP-1A engine and is flying customers. The 737 MAX grounding likely will mean a delay for Malindo Air, a Malaysian carrier that had been expected to receive the first 737 MAX delivery as early as Monday. Norwegian Air Shuttle ASA, which was due to receive its first 737 MAX near the end of May, said it expected a “a few days’ delay.” “This will, however, not delay the launch of our upcoming trans-Atlantic routes from the United States to Edinburgh,” spokesman Anders Lindstrom said in an email. Southwest Airlines Co, the initial customer for the 737 MAX, said Boeing had not warned it of any delays to its delivery schedule. Southwest is expected to begin receiving the jet later in the year after it retires some older 737s. American Airlines Group Inc, which has 100 737 MAX jets on order, declined to comment. The issue arose late last week when Safran found a quality problem in a large metal disc used in the low-pressure turbine at the rear of the engine, said Jamie Jewell, a spokesman for the engine maker, CFM International. CFM notified Boeing, which immediately grounded the fleet of about 21 planes. GE spokesman Rick Kennedy said the disc that prompted the concern had not been installed in an engine. You may also like to watch this video “There have been no issues whatsoever with engines in the field,” Jewell said. All of the 30 to 40 engines that have been built so far will be sent either to Lafayette, Indiana, or Villaroche, France, for inspection, Kennedy said. Many will need to be removed from aircraft and shipped, Jewell said. It was not clear how long the inspections would take to complete. Safran received the disc from a supplier but there are other suppliers of that part so production of the engine was continuing, Kennedy said. No Comments.

Business News Home > Business > Business News < Back to SMG 45 Thursday, 11 May 2017 | MYT 1:47 PM Boeing suspends 737 MAX flights due to engine issue KUALA LUMPUR: Boeing Co has temporarily halted test flights of its new 737 MAX aircraft due to an issue with the engine, which is jointly made by General Electric Co and Safran SA of France, just as Malindo Air was set to receive the first delivery on Monday. Reuters reported the grounding comes days before Boeing was due to deliver its first 737 MAX to an airline and marks a high-profile delay in a programme that Boeing had said was ahead of schedule. It poses no safety concerns for travelers because no airlines are yet flying the 737 MAX but it could mean a costly disruption if the problem persists. Timely delivery is important to planemakers as they get most of the payment for a plane when it is handed to the buyer, the wire report said. Boeing and engine maker CFM said they do not know how long the delay will last. Malindo was set to use the jet for its Kuala Lumpur-Singapore route from May 19. But Malindo CEO Chandran Rama Muthy told Reuters that it does not plan to use the plane until May 22, without elaborating on the reason for the delay. Malindo Air, which has Malaysian and Indonesian shareholders, was scheduled to use the narrowbody aircraft for the Kuala Lumpur-Singapore route later this month. Malindo Air’s parent company Lion Air has ordered eight 737 Max jetliner, of which four are to join Malindo Air’s fleet. The 737 MAX replaces an older version of Boeing's best-selling single-aisle aircraft, a key moneymaker for the aerospace company.  The 737 MAX 8, the first version of the plane to be built, seats 162 passengers in a typical two-class configuration. It carries a list price of US$110 million but airlines typically receive steep discounts. Malaysia Airlines ordered last year 50 737 Max aircraft worth US$5.5bil, but the delivery would only start from 2019. The national airline has also finalised a US$630mil order for CFM’s Leap-1B engines to power 25 of the aircraft. A delay in getting aircraft to customers likely would cause a build up in Boeing's inventory, "as planes essentially sit waiting for engines," said analyst Rob Stallard at Vertical Research Partners. "Investors are acutely focused" on the risks of speeding up production of the new engine, known as the LEAP-1B, he was quoted as saying by Reuters. Separately, Airbus said it was continuing flights with its A320neo, which is powered by the similar LEAP-1A engine and is flying customers.

The alleged non-reporting happened on April 28, 2017, while operating a flight on a Boeing 777 (VT-JEQ) from Delhi to Hong Kong. The commander was also acting as the designated examiner, doing the tenth and final route check of a co-pilot who would have been promoted to the rank of captain, had he operated this flight perfectly. However, due to some reportedly incorrect procedures like "inadequate flare" the aircraft touched down before the touch down point and made a heavy landing — in technical terms it made a 3.2 G landing while according to Boeing, the B-777 should not have over 2G landing. Since such heavy landings can damage aircraft structure, it is mandatory to get the plane checked to ensure it is not stressed or damaged before being released for flights again. But in this case the crew did not report the issue due to which the aircraft has been flying unchecked since the heavy landing last week. On the other hand, the commander failed his co-pilot for the "inadequate flare" which led to the hard landing. A statement by Jet said: "Hard landings are not an uncommon phenomena in the industry and reporting a hard landing depends on crew judgement and other factors. In the absence of empirical assessments, reporting of such events that may require maintenance inspection is dependent primarily, on crew prudence. The said aircraft remained serviceable even after completion of requisite inspections. "The airline has an internal active safety management system, which is continuously updated with learnings from across the aviation industry. At Jet Airways, safety of our guests, crew and assets is of paramount importance." Defining the duties of a designated examiner, DGCA rules say: "The pilot in command retains all command responsibility and is ultimately responsible for the safety of operation... The designated examiner shall remain alert to all flight safety hazards and announce these immediately."

In presenting the Heroes of the Heart Award to William Cusato, Boeing’s director of service engineering and operations, Board President Meg Cutuli praised him and the company for donating time, money and materials to enhance staff development and student programs for the past 10 years. The company has contributed more than $500,000, Cutuli said, and has been instrumental in helping the district build its STEAM (Science Technology Engineering Arts and Mathematics) program. “I remember years ago you would actually bring us backpacks loaded with school supplies for our needy children,” Cutuli said. “You guys have just run the gamut. You have enhanced the education of our children immensely. We are so grateful.” Superintendent Sherry Kropp said Boeing financed Los Alamitos High’s first robotics team and has supported engineering programs at the high school and “maker spaces” that allow elementary and middle schools to invent and innovate. In addition, many Boing employees have spoken at schools and participated in projects with students, including the annual mentor breakfast that connects Los Alamitos students with working professionals, she said. In accepting the award on behalf of Boeing, Cusato, parent of a Los Alamitos High junior, said his company is “proud of our history and our relationship with the Los Alamitos school district. We are honored to partner with the Los Al community for the future. What your teachers do for our students, who become our employees, means we are all in this together.

Photographer: David Ryder/Bloomberg Boeing Co. is temporarily suspending flights of its new 737 Max jetliner because of a potential manufacturing flaw in the engines, marring the commercial debut for the fastest-selling plane in company history. The jetmaker and its engine supplier, a venture of  General Electric Co. and  Safran SA, are rushing to understand the problem ahead of the aircraft’s first delivery, which remains scheduled for later this month. Boeing said a possible quality defect in the Leap engine’s low-pressure turbine discs was discovered during inspections and hadn’t affected flight testing of the upgraded 737. The grounding added to concerns about the strain on suppliers as the U.S. manufacturer and European rival  Airbus SE unveil new aircraft models while ramping up single-aisle production to record levels. Boeing is counting on a smooth start for the 737 Max, the newest version of a plane that is the company’s largest source of profit, as it seeks to boost cash flow. “Investors are acutely focused on 737 Max ramp risk -- and the impact on cash,” Robert Stallard, an analyst at Vertical Research Partners, said in a note to clients. Boeing fell 1.2 percent to $183.18 at the close in New York, the second-biggest decline on the Dow Jones Industrial Average, after adjusting for the beginning of trading without the right to a dividend. GE dropped 0.8 percent to $28.70. First Delivery The Max has accumulated 3,714 orders before its commercial debut but is still racing to catch up to Airbus’s A320neo. The latest 737 model is slated to be handed over this month to Malindo Air and  Norwegian Air Shuttle ASA. Other major customers with deliveries this year include Southwest Airlines Co. and American Airlines Group Inc. The decision to halt flights was made “out of an abundance of caution,” said Boeing spokesman Doug Alder, adding that the plane completed flight testing months ahead of schedule.  “The step is consistent with our priority focus on safety.” The most important business stories of the day. Get Bloomberg's daily newsletter. Sign Up Malindo, an affiliate of Indonesian carrier PT Lion Mentari Airlines, didn’t respond to an email seeking comment. It had expected to take the 737 Max early next week, advertising that commercial service would begin May 19. In 2012, Lion announced the signing of a $22.4 billion order with Boeing. Other Asian customers for the Max include SpiceJet Ltd. in India, Singapore-based lessor BOC Aviation Ltd., VietJet Aviation Joint Stock Co. in Vietnam and the continent’s biggest carrier China Southern Airlines Co. Rick Kennedy, a spokesman for GE Aviation, said about 30 CFM International engines will be inspected at sites in the U.S. and France. In the meantime, production will continue using discs from other CFM suppliers, he said. The issue doesn’t affect other versions of the Leap engine used on planes from Airbus and Commercial Aircraft Corp. of China Ltd., Kennedy said. “This doesn’t look like a serious concern,” Cai von Rumohr, an analyst with Cowen & Co., said in a note to clients. The engine problem is “not a design shortfall but what appears to be an easily fixable sub-tier supplier component issue.” Both CFM and rival Pratt & Whitney, which together make the bulk of engines for narrow-body commercial jets, have encountered faults as they’ve churned out turbines over the past year. Pratt Delays Airbus has fallen behind in deliveries of its A320neo family of aircraft as Pratt’s cutting-edge geared turbofan engine encounters durability issues and production snarls. Executives of Air Lease Corp., a Los Angeles-based aircraft lessor, warned during an earnings call last week that a CFM-powered model was also encountering delays. CFM faces a steep production increase for the Leap, as Boeing and Airbus plot to increase narrow-body production by 33 percent through the decade’s end. After delivering 77 of the engines last year, 28 fewer than it had predicted, CFM has targeted producing about 500 Leap this year and about 2,000 in 2020. “It’s important that this gets straightened out pronto,” Nicholas Heymann, an analyst at William Blair & Co., said of the engine issue. Bladed discs, located in the hot section of a turbofan engine, pull energy from the hot gases of the combustor to produce thrust. The components must be able to withstand extreme stresses and high temperatures inside the engine. The Leap 1-B engines, created for Boeing’s Max, were repeatedly inspected during more than 2,000 hours in the air for the Max 8’s flight test program, which concluded during the first quarter, Alder said. The engine endured another 3,000 simulated flight cycles during testing that ended last month so the plane would be certified for long ocean flights. Airline Impact The impact on airline customers eager to show off the brand-new planes wasn’t immediately apparent. Boeing has several unaffected engines available that it could swap to avoid lengthy delays on initial deliveries, Alder said. For Norwegian, also awaiting its first Max this month, the inspections “will result in a few days’ delay” but aren’t expected to disrupt the carrier’s new trans-Atlantic flights starting next month, spokesman Anders Lindstrom said in an email. The carrier had expected to take five more of the single-aisle planes in June. Southwest and American said they hadn’t been notified of any changes to their Max delivery schedules. Southwest is the second-biggest customer for the Max after Lion Air, with 200 on order, while American has ordered 100 of the planes. On-time delivery of Southwest’s Max planes is critical because the Dallas-based airline is counting on them to fill a gap when it retires its oldest aircraft on Oct. 1. Southwest is set to take delivery of its first Max in July, the airline’s chief financial officer said in January. American is scheduled to receive four Max aircraft this year, the first in the third quarter. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

BA stock was off by about 3% before recovering in afternoon trading. Bloomberg is reporting that the engine, made by General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) and Safran SA joint venture CFM International, had a manufacturing issue relating to its turbine discs. GE shares were off less than 1% in Wednesday’s trade, reacting quickly to the news, but not with much conviction. Boeing spokesman Doug Adler said via email, “Out of an abundance of caution, we decided to temporarily suspend Max flights. The step is consistent with our priority focus on safety for all who use and fly our products.” Boeing was expected to begin deliveries of the new aircraft within days to its first expected customer, Norwegian Air Shuttle, though Southwest Airlines Co (NYSE:LUV) is expected to take delivery in July. BA said it still plans on delivering sometime later this month. According to the Puget Sound Business Journal, Norwegian has ordered 100 737 Max units, just a fraction of Boeing’s 3,400 orders for the aircraft. The decline in BA stock wasn’t entirely driven by the 737 Max report. Shares dropped early in the morning as Boeing went ex-dividend for its $1.42 quarterly payout. This story will be updated. As of this writing, Robert Martin did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

The company later confirmed the temporary halt, citing issues with low-pressure turbine discs in the LEAP-1B engines developed jointly by General Electric Company (NYSE: GE) and Safran SA (EPA: SAF). However, it reportedly assured that the concern is with a quality control problem among a specific batch of parts rather than a serious design flaw. "Out of an abundance of caution, we decided to temporarily suspend MAX flights,” Boeing said in a statement. “The step is consistent with our priority focus on safety for all who use and fly our products.” Nonetheless, Boeing doesn't expect the inspection to disrupt the aircraft’s delivery schedule. Airline clients are still set to receive the model by the end of May. According to the company’s website, the 737 MAX is a significant portion of the business as it comprises 108 of the company’s 210 year-to-date orders. Global customers include American Airlines Group Inc (NASDAQ: AAL), United Continental Holdings Inc (NYSE: UAL) and Southwest Airlines Co (NYSE: LUV). Although a mid-day Cowen note suggested that the "373 MAX engine issue looks like a very short term blip that should be easily correctable,"shares were trading down 1.8 percent at $182.12.

By Jon Ostrower NEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- Boeing on Wednesday announced it was grounding all flights of its new single-aisle 737 Max.

The unmanned spaceplane spent 718 days in orbit before coming down, about a month and a half longer than the craft's previous record of 674 days. The Air Force operates two X-37Bs, which are reusable spaceplanes built by Boeing that launch on Atlas V rockets for extended missions in orbit. Similar to the Space Shuttle in appearance, the X-37B is only about a quarter of the size at 29 feet long. The spaceplane needs no cockpit or life support systems, and can operate in orbit for hundreds of days at a time. Like the Space Shuttle, the X-37B has double doors that cover a payload bay, which is about the size of the bed of a pickup truck. What exactly the Air Force uses the X-37B for is classified. The description of the spacecraft on the USAF website reads: "Managed by the Air Force Rapid Capabilities Office, the X-37B program is the newest and most advanced re-entry spacecraft that performs risk reduction, experimentation and concept of operations development for reusable space vehicle technologies." It has been widely speculated that the craft is used for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) missions, spying on operations in places like Iran and North Korea. Because the craft can land and have its payload swapped out whenever the Air Force deems it necessary, the X-37B could potentially be used for a number of missions and testing platforms. Experts have also guessed that the X-37B could be used for testing autonomous flight technologies, serve as a communications relay in orbit, or serve as a testing platform for systems that could ultimately be used on a manned spacecraft. View photos Photo credit: U.S. Air ForceMore The operations of the X-37B might be classified, but there is no hiding it when it reenters the atmosphere and shakes the countryside with a sonic boom. This is the first time the craft has landed in Florida, having performed all three of its previous landings in California. Another mission using the X-37B is scheduled to launch from Cape Canaveral later this year. How long the X-37B will orbit this time, and what exactly it will be doing, is known only by a handful of people in the Department of Defense.

FANG ZHE / XINHUA The C919 is not just the first homegrown Chinese passenger jet, it is the nation's first large plane with intellectual property rights. Besides international standards, it boasts a global sourcing model akin to that of Boeing Co and Airbus Group SE. Global sourcing is believed to raise production efficiency and save on costs. But manufacturers retain control over key technologies. The C919 also boasts several significant technical breakthroughs. Intense research and development process preceded its making. For example, it uses a large amount of composite materials. "A lot of people said that China only built the shell for the C919. This is a misunderstanding. Ensemble is one of the core technologies of large aircraft manufacturing. It's also a great difficulty for the aviation manufacturing industry," Ye Wei, executive director and president of COMAC America Corporation told Xinhua. "The breakthrough of aircraft integration technology marks a great progress that China has made in the aviation sector." Ye said that in order to achieve international standards, the C919 adopted global cooperation. Its engine, avionics system, as well as flight control system, are manufactured by many joint ventures and wholly-owned entities in Europe and the United States. Its suppliers include international majors such as General Electric Aviation and Honeywell Aerospace. "Internationalized business development requires global cooperation, and international procurement is a necessary path," he said. "From this perspective, the C919 creates values for the global enterprises, and it bears hope from around the world," Ye told Xinhua. In fact, it is a common practice for the commercial aircraft manufacturing industry to rely on suppliers and component makers from around the world. Wang Yanan, editor-in-chief of Aerospace Knowledge magazine, said the design and manufacture of large aircraft require integration of complex systems, and China serves as the host and the top designer. "For the C919, China made specific technical requirements regarding the subsystems, and some international suppliers need to upgrade their systems to adapt to the C919 aircraft," he said. "The design and assembly themselves constitute a key technology, which involves dynamics, aerodynamics and others. There aren't many developing countries that can come up with a plan and achieve it." Wang said China now has the capability to manufacture passenger aircraft fully by itself. But the manufacturing period will get longer, and it will be difficult to control the market. When the C919 project was launched, its maker COMAC aimed to develop a commercial airplane that will adapt to the global market, instead of labeling the aircraft a made-in-China product, which is an old-fashioned concept. Meanwhile, Boeing and Airbus are keen to cooperate with COMAC, to take advantage of the opportunities and talent in China. They hope to tap into the local market. Several hundreds of international partners are also benefiting from the development of the C919 project. Liu Shaoyong, chairman of China Eastern Airlines, said as the first global customer that will use the C919 aircraft, the carrier is looking forward to press the plane into service as soon as possible. The first route of the C919 will connect Shanghai and Beijing. The first flight on this route is expected to be around the 2020-22 period. Liu said the C919 integrates the highest level of scientific applications in both domestic and international aviation industries. It also enjoys certain late-mover advantages, and is designed at a high starting point. "The market for civil aviation is broad, and China is already a huge market. An aircraft that is safe, economical, comfortable and environmentally-friendly will be favored by the market. I am sure that the C919 will become very popular," he said. Engineers test the windshield of the C919 at a facility in Chengdu, Sichuan province.

Maj. Ric Turner, an F-15 fighter pilot with the 40th Flight Test Squadron, flies a test mission with the Talon HATE Pod slung beneath the F-15’s fuselage. (U.S. Air Force Photo / Brandi Hansen) The Boeing Co. and the U.S. Air Force say they’ve shown that a new type of communication pod for F-15 fighter jets, known as Talon HATE, can link together different types of aircraft and ground stations for secure communications. The Boeing-developed system is designed to knit together the communication systems aboard F-15 jets and other traditional weapons systems, plus the F-22 stealth fighters built for the Air Force by Lockheed Martin. The F-22 uses a special type of networking system that’s optimized for stealthiness but poses a challenge for communication with non-stealth airplanes, as explained in this report from Foxtrot Alpha. During a flight demonstration conducted out of Nellis Air Force Base in Nevada, Talon HATE pods on two F-15C aircraft enabled test pilots to share information through a variety of channels, including the Wideband Global Satcom system, Boeing said in today’s news release. “We’ve completed developmental flight test,” Lt. Col. Christopher Bradley, Air Force Talon HATE manager, said in the release. “We look forward to fielding this system, not only to immediately provide aircrews with actionable information faster and at a higher quality, but also to help the Air Force learn important lessons for the employment of tactical gateway systems in the future.” Paul Geery, vice president of Phantom Works Mission Solutions and Boeing’s Talon HATE manager, said the networking platform represents “a giant leap forward in tactical fighter capability with real-time connectivity and expanded information sharing.” Boeing said further tests will be conducted later this year with advanced sensors. Even after today’s update, there’s much about the networking system that’s still a mystery – including an obvious puzzle: What does “HATE” stand for?

(Photo: Scoot)  By Olivia Siong @OliviaSiongCNA 11 May 2017 11:31AM (Updated: 11 May 2017 12:01PM) Share this content Share on Facebook Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on LinkedIn Share via Whatsapp Share via Whatsapp Share via E-Mail Share via E-Mail SEATTLE, United States: Singapore budget carrier Scoot is setting its sights on operating at least three to four long-haul routes within the next two to three years, according to its CEO Lee Lik Hsin. In an interview with Channel NewsAsia on Thursday (May 11), Mr Lee revealed that travellers can expect Scoot to announce one new long-haul route by this year, followed by another in 2018. He declined to name any specific destinations but hinted that the airline will not be limiting itself to Asia. The company later said it is exploring Honolulu, Hawaii, as a possible destination, after reports stating it could fly there by end-2017 emerged.  Mr Lee was in Seattle where Scoot is set to pick up a new 787 Dreamliner on Friday (Singapore time) from American aircraft manufacturer Boeing. This will be the 14th in Scoot’s all-Dreamliner fleet, but the new plane comes with an added feature - crew rest bunks. Advertisement Advertisement “The first few aeroplanes that we took did not have the crew rest bunks and so could not be deployed on the long-haul routes per se," said Mr Lee. "With this, we clearly signalled our intention that we want to be in that space, to fly long-haul routes in our network.” MAXIMISING EFFICIENCY Last August, Scoot announced its first long-haul flight to Europe with the opening of a Singapore-Athens route, which is set to begin next month. In an update, Mr Lee said the current take-up is “quite healthy” - with about 70 per cent of the seats sold so far within the first few months of operation. When asked why the frequency of the route is being reduced from four times a week, to three in mid-September and down to two in October, he said this had been planned from the start to take into account the peak summer months and the lull during winter months. He noted that efficiency will be maximised during the lull months by finding other routes where the frequency can be increased instead. In the case of the Athens route, Mr Lee said this is balanced by increasing the frequency of flights to Sapporo, Japan, where winter is a peak travel season. HANDLING THE COMPETITION The CEO also claimed that the low-cost carrier is not making any adjustments to its long-haul route plans just yet, despite aggressive moves from competitors such as Norwegian. The Scandinavian budget carrier announced in April that it will be launching a non-stop service between Singapore and London. Reports have also suggested that Norwegian intends to introduce routes between Singapore and Paris, Rome as well as Scandinavia. But Scoot, which is the low cost arm of Singapore Airlines, said plans for its growth has always been “fairly aggressive from the start”. Besides the 20 aircraft in its fleet, which it will soon have, Mr Lee said there are plans for Scoot to further boost the number of planes it operates by tapping on new aircraft ordered by Singapore Airlines (SIA). In February, SIA placed a US$13.8 billion (S$19.5 billion) order for 39 aircraft from Boeing. “The recent SIA order ... will help us as well because there’s some flexibility within those orders to convert into Scoot aircraft,” Mr Lee explained. “I think we are going to rely more on the parent company because they have the purchasing power and economies ... if we are to go out and buy five to 10 aeroplanes, we probably wouldn’t get a very good price."   Source: CNA/am Share this content Share on Facebook Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on LinkedIn Share via Whatsapp Share via Whatsapp Share via E-Mail Share via E-Mail More stories for you More information about Channel News Asia jump to top of page Sections Asia Pacific Singapore World CNA Insider Business Sport Lifestyle Technology Health Commentary About Us About Channel NewsAsia Hotel Partners Events & Seminars Presenters & Correspondents Contact Us Advertise with us Contact Sales Online Advertising TV Advertising Get the news that matters in your inbox every morning!

The price of U.S. crude oil jumped 3 percent as fuel stockpiles kept shrinking, and that made investors more optimistic about energy company profits. Strong earnings from Electronic Arts and chipmaker Nvidia helped technology stocks move up. However weak results from Priceline and Disney hurt consumer-focused companies, and health care stocks also stumbled as drug companies fell. The Standard & Poor’s 500 index picked up 2.71 points, or 0.1 percent, to 2,399.63, a fraction of a point above the all-time high it set Monday. The Dow Jones industrial average shed 32.67 points, or 0.2 percent, to 20,943.11 as Disney and Boeing slumped. The Nasdaq composite finished at a record for the fourth day in a row as it rose 8.56 points, or 0.1 percent, to 6,129.14. The Russell 2000 index of small-company stocks was up 7.73 points, or 0.6 percent, to 1,399.59. Benchmark U.S. crude surged $1.45, or 3.2 percent, to $47.33 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, the international standard, gained $1.49, or 3.1 percent, to $50.22 a barrel in London EOG Resources gained $2.90, or 3.2 percent, to $94.54 and Chevron added $1.42, or 1.4 percent, to $106.50. Crude oil prices have fallen in recent weeks as investors wondered if the members of OPEC and other key oil-producing countries will be able to limit production and support prices. U.S. oil has traded between around $45 and $55 a barrel this year as investors worried about oil prices and profits at energy companies. The S&P 500’s energy sector has dropped 10 percent in 2017. Revenue for online booking service Priceline was a bit lower than analysts expected and the company’s profit forecast for the current quarter was also disappointing. That sent the stock down $86.72, or 4.5 percent, to $1,824.41. Priceline has soared 44 percent over the last 12 months. Boeing lost $2.31, or 1.2 percent, to $183.18 after it suspended test flights of its new 737 Max plane because of possible problems with a key engine part. Watchmaker Fossil tumbled after another weaker-than-expected quarterly report. The company said sales of traditional watches and other jewelry continued to fall. The stock fell $3.71, or 20.4 percent, to $14.44. The stock traded above $100 a share as recently as December 2014 but has been trading at eight-year lows. Bond prices rose early but later returned that gain. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note remained at 2.41 percent. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline rose 5 cents to $1.54 a gallon. Heating oil added 3 cents to $1.48 a gallon. Natural gas climbed 7 cents to $3.29 per 1,000 cubic feet. Gold inched up $2.80 to settle at $1,218.90 an ounce. Silver rose 14 cents to $16.21 an ounce. Copper was unchanged at $2.49 a pound. The dollar rose to 114.33 yen from 114.28 yen. The euro dipped to $1.0862 from $1.0869. In Britain, the FTSE 100 jumped 0.6 percent. Germany’s DAX rose 0.1 percent and the CAC 40 in France finished unchanged. The Japanese Nikkei 225 gained 0.3 percent and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index rose 0.5 percent. The Kospi of South Korea fell 1 percent.

Business News Home > Business > Business News < Back to SMG 45 Thursday, 11 May 2017 | MYT 8:53 AM Oil prices rise Thursday on falling US crude stocks, Saudi supply cut to Asia Brent crude futures, the international benchmark for oil prices, were at $50.33 per barrel at 0039 GMT on Thursday, up 11 cents, or 0.2 percent, from their last close. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude oil futures <CLc1> were trading at $47.46 per barrel, up 13 cents, or 0.3 percent from the last settlement. SINGAPORE: Oil prices rose on Thursday, and Brent was firmly back over $50 per barrel, as a fall in U.S. crude inventories and a more severe than expected cut in Saudi supplies to Asia tightened the market. Brent crude futures, the international benchmark for oil prices, were at $50.33 per barrel at 0039 GMT on Thursday, up 11 cents, or 0.2 percent, from their last close. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude oil futures <CLc1> were trading at $47.46 per barrel, up 13 cents, or 0.3 percent from the last settlement. "We saw the biggest draw in inventories for the year last week with stockpiles down more than 5 million barrels. And it looks like OPEC's production cut is finally biting," said Greg McKenna, chief market strategist at CFD and FX provider AxiTrader. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and other producers including Russia have pledged to cut output by almost 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) during the first half of the year. So far, however, there have been few signs that global markets are actually tightening as producers shielded their biggest customers, especially in Asia, from the cuts. But after Brent prices fell back below $50 per barrel last week, analysts said producers felt forced to act. Saudi Arabia, the world's biggest oil exporter, has notified several Asian refiners of its first cuts in crude allocations for regional buyers since OPEC's output reduction took effect in January. Reuters reported on Tuesday that state-owned Saudi Aramco will reduce oil supplies to Asian customers by about 7 million barrels in June. In the United States, U.S. crude stockpiles posted their biggest one-week drawdown since December last week as imports dropped sharply, while inventories of refined products also fell. Crude inventories <USOILC=ECI> fell 5.2 million barrels in the week to May 5, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said. At 522.5 million barrels, crude stocks were the lowest since February. - Reuters Tags / Keywords: Oil & Gas , Commodities , Stocks , Investing , Markets Related Stories You May Be Interested OCBC agrees to buy National Australia Bank Asian wealth units Japan competes with China, makes sales pitch to win Malaysia-Singapore rail project Billionaire Ackman has a winner that is up 30% but will not name names Breakfast briefing: Thursday, May 11 (Update) Boeing suspends 737 MAX flights due to engine issue Seven reasons to get an iPhone now Others Also Read China’s tech money heads for Israel as US welcome wanes Beverage firm serves huge helping of healthy fun Couple, hotel manager charged with human trafficking Property Related advertisement Latest News Macquarie-led group buys Australia's Endeavour Energy for US$5.6b Exxon Mobil buys Singapore petrochemical plant, boosts output in Asia Japan competes with China, makes sales pitch to win Malaysia-Singapore rail project Potentially stronger earnings for Gas Malaysia in 2H17 Lazada offers offline payment services in stores nationwide Most Viewed in Business Astro launches NJOI Now Malindo goes global Boeing suspends 737 MAX flights due to engine issue KLCI up nearly 12 points at midday, IW City stages mild rebound Lazada offers offline payment services in stores nationwide Japan competes with China, makes sales pitch to win Malaysia-Singapore rail project YTL Power impasse ends Owner of Malaysia Airlines names top execs of 'Project Hope' Potential game changer - palm kernal made into chicken feed OCBC agrees to buy National Australia Bank Asian wealth units advertisement advertisement site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Lifestyle Tech Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services Magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs Advertising View Our Rate Card Policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu StarProperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com Search The Star Online Connect with us Content Partner Our Radio Stations site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Tech Lifestyle Travel Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs advertising View Our Rate Card policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu starproperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com social media Facebook Twitter Copyright © 1995- Star Media Group Berhad (ROC 10894D)

"We must retire the ISS as soon as possible… We simply cannot afford $3.5 billion a year of that cost," Aldrin said Tuesday when speaking at the 2017 Humans to Mars conference in Washington, DC. Aldrin believes NASA’s efforts and financial resources should be devoted to getting humans to Mars. He said that Low Earth Orbit (LEO) missions around the Earth would be better suited to private industry, such as SpaceX, Orbital ATK, Blue Origin and Boeing among others. READ MORE: A step closer to Mars: SpaceX test fires ‘world’s most powerful rocket’ (VIDEO) Former astronaut Buzz Aldrin © Kevin Lamarque / Reuters Bigelow Aerospace, Axiom Space and other private companies should install their own space stations in orbit, freeing up NASA scientists and their vast expertise, for the arguably more important goal of transforming humanity into an interplanetary species. In an ideal scenario, there would be high levels of cooperation and coordination between private enterprise from across the globe, especially between the forerunners – US, Russia and China, which aims to establish its own orbital station by the early 2020s. Such cooperation may be easier said than done, however. Aldrin’s plan for colonizing Mars depends on private industry handling the grunt work closer to home and acting as a resupply base for ‘cyclers,’ or cargo spaceships that would run in a continuous loop between the Red Planet and Earth. His plan is firmly grounded in reality though, drawing on his own experiences with spaceflight. "The foundation of human transportation is the cycler," the 87-year-old NASA pioneer said. "Very rugged, so it'll last 30 years or so; no external moving parts." READ MORE: Cosmic concrete ideal for Mars can make Red Planet settlement a reality Stage one would involve establishing a more diverse orbital presence before constructing a series of cyclers that would run between LEO and the moon with a view to creating a lunar base. Such a base would, in turn, allow scientists to develop the tools and techniques necessary to effectively colonize Mars while simultaneously reducing the overall risk, given the extraordinarily high up front cost of transporting materials and people to the Red Planet. In terms of a rough timeline, Aldrin estimates that with sufficient willpower and the correct allocation of resources, mankind could manage a crewed mission to a near-Earth asteroid by 2020 and a Venus flyby by 2024. With regards the Red Planet, he is a little more realistic than optimistic. READ MORE: Happy Martian New Year: NASA’s alien imagery from the Red Planet (PHOTOS) He believes that, with all elements running as smoothly and effectively as humanly possible, the first Martian colonies could be established by the early 2030s. The first humans on Mars, in Aldrin’s vision, would be settlers, not tourists. "Let's be certain that we've developed a sustainable plan to stay on Mars," he said. "No flags and footprints this time." At present, ISS has enough funding to last until 2024, but officials from both the Russian Federal Space Agency and NASA have considered the possibility pumping additional funding into the billion-dollar enterprise to increase its lifespan until 2028.

The lack of volatility remained as headlines were filled with the fallout from President Donald Trump’s decision on Tuesday to fire FBI Director James Comey. The political chaos that has resulted (with many calling it a constitutional crisis, despite the move being well within Trump’s executive powers) has many worried that the White House’s legislative agenda will be slowed. So while there were some flurries of excitement after a big mid-day drop in Boeing Co (NYSE:BA) on reports of 737 MAX engine issues, there wasn’t much to move the broader indices. Read more from Anthony Mirhaydari and other top money experts In the end, the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.2%, the S&P 500 gained 0.1%, the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.1% and the Russell 2000 gained 0.6%. Treasury bonds were unchanged, the dollar was lower overall, gold gained 0.2%, and crude oil rallied 3.2% after a surprise inventory draw (the largest since 2016 despite U.S. production back to 2015 levels).© Provided by InvestorPlace Dow Jones Industrial Average Volume was 101% of the New York Stock Exchange’s 30-day average, while breadth was positive, with 1.9 advancers for every decliner. Energy led the way with a 1.1% gain while industrials were the laggards, down 0.4%. 9 Dividend Stocks to Buy for 6%-Plus Yields A few of the day’s single-stock highlights: Load Error Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) surged 16.8% after a top- and bottom-line beat as datacenter sales more than compensated for some softness in gaming GPU sales. Electronic Arts Inc. (NASDAQ:EA) gained 13.5% on better-than-expected earnings thanks to solid performances from the company’s FIFA and Battlefield titles. And in a rare bout of good news for the beleaguered retail sector, turnaround play Abercrombie & Fitch Co (NYSE:ANF) gained 12.6% after Reuters reported the company is receiving takeover interest. On the downside, watchmaker Fossil Group Inc (NASDAQ:FOSL) dropped 21.4% on mixed Q1 results and lowered guidance amid persistent headwinds for the traditional watch category and a lack of traction in its wearables initiatives. Yelp Inc (NYSE:YELP) lost 18.8% on in-line results and weak forward guidance thanks to higher customer churn. Walt Disney Co (NYSE:DIS) fell 2.4% amid ongoing pressure on its cable business as higher costs weighed on ESPN. That boosted the May $114 DIS puts recommended to Edge Pro subscribers to a 124% gain. © Provided by InvestorPlace Disney stock chart And after the bell, Snap Inc (NYSE:SNAP) took a 25%-plus bath on weak revenues and user growth. Looking ahead, Thursday will feature an update on inflation with the release of the producer price index data ahead of Friday’s retail sales report. Both will likely provide further support for very strong expectations of another Federal Reserve interest rate hike next month.

The price of U.S. crude oil jumped 3 percent, and that made investors more optimistic about energy company profits. Oil prices made big gains as reports showed U.S. crude stockpiles dropped by 5.2 million barrels last week. Benchmark U.S. crude surged $1.45, or 3.2 percent, to $47.33 a barrel in New York. The Standard & Poor’s 500 index picked up 2.71 points, or 0.1 percent, to 2,399.63, a fraction of a point above the all-time high it set Monday. The Dow Jones industrial average shed 32.67 points, or 0.2 percent, to 20,943.11 as Disney and Boeing slumped. The Nasdaq composite finished at a record for the fourth day in a row as it rose 8.56 points, or 0.1 percent, to 6,129.14. The Russell 2000 index of small-company stocks was up 7.73 points, or 0.6 percent, to 1,399.59. ENERGY Small leak from pipeline in S.D. The Dakota Access pipeline leaked 84 gallons of oil in South Dakota early last month, which an American Indian tribe says bolsters its argument that the pipeline jeopardizes its water supply and deserves further environmental review. The April 4 spill was relatively small and it didn’t threaten any waterways. The state’s Department of Environment and Natural Resources posted a report in its website’s searchable database, but it didn’t take any other steps to announce it to the public, despite an ongoing lawsuit by four Sioux tribes seeking to shut down the pipeline. ATHLETICS TaylorMade Golf Co. is sold TaylorMade Golf Co. has been sold to a private equity firm after being shopped for a year by parent company Adidas. The agreement announced Wednesday means KPS Capital Partners will acquire TaylorMade for $425 million, about half of that paid in cash. Carlsbad, Calif.-based TaylorMade was founded in 1979. Adidas bought the company in 1998. Food and DRINK Whole Foods changes leadership Whole Foods Market on Wednesday announced a drastic shake-up of its board of directors, replacing five members in a bid to reassure investors it is taking action to bounce back from a sustained slump. The company has posted seven consecutive quarters of declining sales at its stores open more than a year amid an assault from fast-growing competitors. The retailer also pledged to take on $300 million in new cost-cutting initiatives.

Photo / Getty Images Wall Street was mixed as investors tried to assess the long-term impact of US President Donald Trump's stunning firing of FBI Director James Comey. "We were not expecting to see a quick succession of moving toward the administration's agenda, and this certainly is not reducing that contentious environment," Eric Wiegand, a New York-based senior portfolio manager at the Private Client Reserve at US Bank, told Reuters. Others agreed. "All in all, this does not support the view that the US Trumpflation trade faces an easy road ahead of it," Michael Every, head of financial markets research at Rabobank Group in Hong Kong, wrote in a note, Bloomberg reported. "It underlines that real surprises can pop up out of the box at any time right now." In 3.08pm trading in New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 0.2 per cent. However, the Nasdaq Composite Index rose 0.2 per cent. In 2.53pm trading, the Standard & Poor's 500 Index added 0.1 per cent. The Dow moved lower as slides in shares of Walt Disney and those of Boeing, down 2.4 per cent and 1.9 per cent respectively, outweighed gains in shares of Chevron and those of Caterpillar, recently up 1.3 per cent and 1 per cent respectively. Walt Disney shares fell after the company posted disappointing quarterly earnings. "Although we think that Disney can probably grow faster than most of its peers in the long run because of its global studio and parks businesses, it is also more weighted down by tepid growth and longer-term margin compression at media networks," Brian Wieser, an analyst at Pivotal Research Group, wrote in a note, Bloomberg reported.

The European planemaker uses a different version of the engine from those supplied to Boeing, which said earlier it had halted test flights on its 737 MAX due to an engine issue. Asked whether Airbus continued to carry out development test flights and pre-delivery test flights on A320neo-family aircraft powered by the LEAP-1A engine, made by GE-Safran venture CFM International, a spokesman for the planemaker said "yes we are". GE said earlier Safran had found a quality problem in a disc used in the low-pressure turbine at the rear of the LEAP-1B engine used by Boeing and notified the jetmaker over the weekend. Safran was not immediately available for comment.

Mr. Erastus Mwencha, Deputy Chairpserson of the African Union Commission (left) meets with Mr. Delkaso. advertorial Tristar Praises Trump, EXIM Bank for Creating Jobs May 10, 2017 Updated 10 hrs ago 0 The Hon. Mr. Erastus Mwencha, Deputy Chairpserson of the African Union Commission (left) meets with Mr. Delkaso. (NewsUSA) - A small Virginia business that will help create manufacturing jobs in U.S and energy development in Ethiopia praised President Trump for his support of the Export-Import (EXIM) Bank of the US as a job-creating and export tool. "Thanks to President Trump for his support of the Export-Import Bank of the U.S. We are on track to create a 1,200 megawatt wind energy project in Ethiopia that is expected to create up to 5,000 U.S. manufacturing jobs producing turbines for export," says Paul Delkaso, President and CEO of Tristar and Tritente Global Energy Group. "EXIM is not just about help-ing large companies like Boeing" Delkaso adds. "It is all about help-ing small- and mid-sized U.S. firms, making America Great Again and bringing security, eco-nomic development and jobs to the African continent." "Exporting American electricity technology will create jobs in the U.S. while demonstrating American leadership in a growing market. Electricity will generate jobs, and improve security and healthcare while stimulating benign economic development." Tristar and its sister company, Tritente Global Energy Group, is working with Détente Group of Virginia, EXIM Bank and leaders in Africa to bring energy security to Africa, where 620 million people lack electricity. "Every industrialized country has an EXIM-type of program to stimulate exports," says Brien Morgan, Managing Partner of Détente Group, which has been working with Tristar and the US EXIM Bank to finalize funding. "Under President Trump's Administration and Rep. Scott Garrett's leadership, Détente looks forward to working with an invigorated US EXIM Bank to deploy its Ethiopian wind farm project along with other US high-tech job-creating projects." The Hon. Mr. Erastus Mwencha, Deputy Chairperson of the African Union Commission, met with the Tritente Global Energy Group team and says that, "Africa is undergoing a sustained period of economic growth and transformation. In order to be sustained, this growth will need to be fueled by a massive investment in energy." "The vision of Tristar and Tritente Global Energy Group in sub-Saharan Africa must be supported and admirable," adds Mwencha. Tristar is also working with several African nations on a new round of infrastructure projects, including rail, port and clean coal, Delkaso says. However, the EXIM support of Detente's $3.6 billion is the best way to create U.S. manufacturing jobs and to boost exports. × Post a comment as Emoticons [smile] [beam] [wink] [sad] [cool] [innocent] [rolleyes] [whistling] [lol] [huh] [tongue] [love] [sleeping] [yawn] [unsure] [angry] [blink] [crying] [ohmy] [scared] [sleep] [sneaky] [tongue_smile] [thumbdown] [thumbup] [censored] [happybirthday] [ban] [spam] [offtopic] [batman] [ninja] [pirate] [alien] Comment Text Cancel Post comment × Report Cancel Report Abuse × Watch this discussion.

While you were sleeping: UPDATED Wall St mixed as Comey impact absorbed Margreet Dietz Thursday May 11, 2017 Share US President Donald Trump fired Comey on a Justice Department recommendation Play NBR radio on   Wall Street was mixed as investors tried to assess the long-term impact of US President Donald Trump's stunning firing of FBI director James Comey. "We were not expecting to see a quick succession of moving toward the administration's agenda, and this certainly is not reducing that contentious environment," Eric Wiegand, a New York-based senior portfolio manager at the Private Client Reserve at US Bank, told Reuters. Others agreed. "All in all, this does not support the view that the US Trumpflation trade faces an easy road ahead of it," Michael Every, head of financial markets research at Rabobank Group in Hong Kong, wrote in a note, Bloomberg reported. "It underlines that real surprises can pop up out of the box at any time right now." At the close of trading in New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 32.67 points, or 0.16%, to 20,943.11. However, the Nasdaq Composite Index rose 0.14% to 6129.14 and the Standard & Poor's 500 Index added 0.11% to 2399.63. The Dow moved lower as slides in shares of Walt Disney and those of Boeing, down 2.2% and 1.2% respectively, outweighed gains in shares of Chevron and those of Caterpillar, recently up 1.4% and 1.0% respectively. Disney disappoints Walt Disney shares fell after the company posted disappointing quarterly earnings. "Although we think that Disney can probably grow faster than most of its peers in the long run because of its global studio and parks businesses, it is also more weighted down by tepid growth and longer-term margin compression at media networks," Brian Wieser, an analyst at Pivotal Research Group, wrote in a note, Bloomberg reported. Energy stocks rose with the price of oil, gaining 3.2% to $US47.33 – its biggest one-day gain since December – as a US Energy Information Administration report showed that domestic crude inventories dropped more than expected in the week to May 5. To be sure, increases in US crude production remain a concern. "Growing oil output in the US, which reached its highest level since August 2015, will remain a thorny issue for price bulls," Abhishek Kumar, senior energy analyst at Interfax Energy's Global Gas Analytics in London, told Reuters. There were also mixed clues about the outlook for US interest rate increases. While Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland President Loretta Mester on Monday warned against complacency towards raising rates, Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan was more cautious. "I still believe the base case for removal of accommodation is three times this year, but I'm very cognizant of the fact that inflation pressures have been more muted," Kaplan told reporters after an event at the Bush Institute in Dallas, Reuters reported. "There's no question that the path toward 2-percent inflation has been slow and uneven." In Europe the Stoxx 600 Index finished the day with a 0.2% advance from the previous close. France's CAC40 Index gained 0.1%, as did Germany's DAX Index, while the UK's FTSE 100 Index rose 0.6%. (BusinessDesk) Got a question about this story? Leave it in Comments & Questions below.

More News Video Buy AP Photo Reprints NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stocks are higher Wednesday afternoon as energy companies are rallying with the price of oil and technology companies move higher. Consumer-focused companies are down following weak first-quarter reports from Priceline and Disney and health care companies are slipping. KEEPING SCORE: The Standard & Poor's 500 index picked up 2 points, or 0.1 percent, to 2,399 as of 3:10 p.m. Eastern time. The Dow Jones industrial average shed 41 points, or 0.2 percent, to 20,934 as Disney and Boeing slumped. The Nasdaq composite rose 9 points, or 0.2 percent, to 6,130 and was on pace for another record close. The Russell 2000 index of small-company stocks was up 8 points, or 0.6 percent, to 1,400. OIL: Oil prices made big gains as reported showed U.S. crude stockpiles shrank again last week. That encouraged investors. Crude oil prices have fallen in recent weeks as investors wondered if the members of OPEC and other key oil-producing countries will be able to limit production and support prices. Benchmark U.S. crude surged $1.45, or 3.2 percent, to $47.33 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, the international standard, gained $1.49, or 3.1 percent, to $50.22 a barrel in London. That sent energy companies higher, as EOG Resources picked up $3.08, or 3.4 percent, to $94.72 and Chevron added $1.43, or 1.4 percent, to $106.51. Crude has wobbled between around $45 and $55 a barrel this year as investors worried about oil prices and profits at energy companies. The S&P 500's energy sector has dropped 10 percent in 2017. THE QUOTE: Investors didn't react much to President Donald Trump's surprise decision to fire FBI Director James Comey Tuesday evening. U.S. stocks also had little reaction to the French presidential election last weekend, although European indexes surged on the win for a centrist candidate. "It's almost as if the market has become numb," said Julian Emanuel, an equity strategist for UBS. "Investors are interpreting this as more noise." Emanuel said investors are waiting for signs about economic growth and success of the Trump administration's business-friendly agenda. Until then, they may just wait and see, in which case stocks will stay in the range they've traded in for the last few months. TECH EARNINGS: Video game maker Electronic Arts and chipmaker Nvidia both reported stronger results than analysts had expected. Electronic Arts, which makes games including "The Sims" and "Mass Effect," rose $12.98, or 13.5 percent, to $108.99 and Nvidia advanced $17.50, or 17 percent, to $120.44. Nvidia tripled in value in 2016 and had wobbled early this year. Emanuel, of UBS, said investors are rewarding companies that are reporting strong earnings growth but don't depend too much on faster economic growth. That includes technology companies and banks. MOUSE MISS: Entertainment giant Walt Disney posted lower sales than investors expected and it said profit at its cable networks declined because of programming costs at ESPN remain high. Its stock fell $2.64, or 2.4 percent, to $109.43. Recently Disney stock suffered a five-day losing streak partly brought on by concerns about cable advertising revenue. OUT OF LINE: Revenue for online booking service Priceline was a bit lower than analysts expected and the company's profit forecast for the current quarter was also disappointing. That sent the stock down $94.57, or 4.9 percent, to $1,816.56. Priceline has soared 44 percent over the last 12 months. YIPES, YELP: Online review website Yelp plunged after it slashed its revenue forecast for the year. That followed a disappointing first-quarter report, and analysts said the company struggled to retain customers. The stock sank $6.49, or 18.7 percent, to $28.21 to reach its lowest price in almost a year. WATCH OUT: Watchmaker Fossil tumbled after another weaker-than-expected quarterly report. The company said sales of traditional watches and other jewelry continued to fall. Fossil stock traded above $100 a share as recently as December 2014 is now trading at eight-year lows as it lost $4.10, or 22.6 percent, to $14.05. HEALTH CARE: Botox maker Allergan is on track for its biggest loss in 2017 as its stock fell for the fourth day in a row. It's down $8.26, or 3.5 percent, to $230.25. Elsewhere biotechnology company Amgen lost $2.93, or 1.8 percent, to $160.29 and Biogen shed $2.73, or 1 percent, to $258.55. BONDS: Bond prices rose early but later returned that gain. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note remained at 2.41 percent. OTHER ENERGY TRADING: Wholesale gasoline rose 5 cents to $1.54 a gallon. Heating oil added 3 cents to $1.48 a gallon. Natural gas climbed 7 cents to $3.29 per 1,000 cubic feet. METALS: Gold inched up $2.80 to settle at $1,218.90 an ounce. Silver rose 14 cents to $16.21 an ounce. Copper was unchanged at $2.49 a pound. CURRENCIES: The dollar rose to 114.33 yen from 114.28 yen. The euro dipped to $1.0862 from $1.0869. OVERSEAS: In Britain, the FTSE 100 jumped 0.6 percent. Germany's DAX rose 0.1 percent and the CAC 40 in France finished unchanged. The Japanese Nikkei 225 gained 0.3 percent and Hong Kong's Hang Seng index rose 0.5 percent. The Kospi of South Korea fell 1 percent. ___ AP Markets Writer Marley Jay can be reached at http://twitter.com/MarleyJayAP His work can be found at https://apnews.com/search/marley%20jayAssociated Press Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Richard Drew) By: Marley Jay The Associated Press Published on NEW YORK — U.S. stocks are higher Wednesday afternoon as energy companies are rallying with the price of oil and technology companies move higher. Consumer-focused companies are down following weak first-quarter reports from Priceline and Disney and health care companies are slipping. KEEPING SCORE: The Standard & Poor's 500 index picked up 2 points, or 0.1 per cent , to 2,399 as of 3:10 p.m. Eastern time. The Dow Jones industrial average shed 41 points, or 0.2 per cent , to 20,934 as Disney and Boeing slumped. The Nasdaq composite rose 9 points, or 0.2 per cent , to 6,130 and was on pace for another record close. The Russell 2000 index of small-company stocks was up 8 points, or 0.6 per cent , to 1,400. OIL: Oil prices made big gains as reported showed U.S. crude stockpiles shrank again last week. That encouraged investors. Crude oil prices have fallen in recent weeks as investors wondered if the members of OPEC and other key oil-producing countries will be able to limit production and support prices.

The trio of Dow DJIA, -0.16% components combined were cutting about 45 points from the blue-chip gauge, which was off 50 points, or 0.2% at 20,924. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 index SPX, +0.11% traded near break-even levels, while the Nasdaq Composite was flirting with another record close, up 0.1% at 6,126. The downdraft for the Dow, which has been under pressure all day, accelerated on reports that Boeing halted flights for its fleet of 737 planes due to problems with its turbine engines. MarketWatch has not interdependently confirmed those reports. Meanwhile, Disney's shares were down after the company disappointed analysts' expectations late-Tuesday on revenues. Shares of 3M Co. MMM, -0.67% were off 0.6%--the third worst performer on a point basis in the Dow.

FANG ZHE / XINHUA The C919 is not just the first homegrown Chinese passenger jet, it is the nation's first large plane with intellectual property rights. Besides international standards, it boasts a global sourcing model akin to that of Boeing Co and Airbus Group SE. Global sourcing is believed to raise production efficiency and save on costs. But manufacturers retain control over key technologies. The C919 also boasts several significant technical breakthroughs. Intense research and development process preceded its making. For example, it uses a large amount of composite materials. "A lot of people said that China only built the shell for the C919. This is a misunderstanding. Ensemble is one of the core technologies of large aircraft manufacturing. It's also a great difficulty for the aviation manufacturing industry," Ye Wei, executive director and president of COMAC America Corporation told Xinhua. "The breakthrough of aircraft integration technology marks a great progress that China has made in the aviation sector." Ye said that in order to achieve international standards, the C919 adopted global cooperation. Its engine, avionics system, as well as flight control system, are manufactured by many joint ventures and wholly-owned entities in Europe and the United States. Its suppliers include international majors such as General Electric Aviation and Honeywell Aerospace. "Internationalized business development requires global cooperation, and international procurement is a necessary path," he said. "From this perspective, the C919 creates values for the global enterprises, and it bears hope from around the world," Ye told Xinhua. In fact, it is a common practice for the commercial aircraft manufacturing industry to rely on suppliers and component makers from around the world.Engineers test the windshield of the C919 at a facility in Chengdu, Sichuan province. LIU KUN / XINHUA Wang Yanan, editor-in-chief of Aerospace Knowledge magazine, said the design and manufacture of large aircraft require integration of complex systems, and China serves as the host and the top designer. "For the C919, China made specific technical requirements regarding the subsystems, and some international suppliers need to upgrade their systems to adapt to the C919 aircraft," he said. "The design and assembly themselves constitute a key technology, which involves dynamics, aerodynamics and others. There aren't many developing countries that can come up with a plan and achieve it." Wang said China now has the capability to manufacture passenger aircraft fully by itself. But the manufacturing period will get longer, and it will be difficult to control the market. When the C919 project was launched, its maker COMAC aimed to develop a commercial airplane that will adapt to the global market, instead of labeling the aircraft a made-in-China product, which is an old-fashioned concept. Meanwhile, Boeing and Airbus are keen to cooperate with COMAC, to take advantage of the opportunities and talent in China. They hope to tap into the local market. Several hundreds of international partners are also benefiting from the development of the C919 project. Liu Shaoyong, chairman of China Eastern Airlines, said as the first global customer that will use the C919 aircraft, the carrier is looking forward to press the plane into service as soon as possible. The first route of the C919 will connect Shanghai and Beijing. The first flight on this route is expected to be around the 2020-22 period. Liu said the C919 integrates the highest level of scientific applications in both domestic and international aviation industries. It also enjoys certain late-mover advantages, and is designed at a high starting point. "The market for civil aviation is broad, and China is already a huge market. An aircraft that is safe, economical, comfortable and environmentally-friendly will be favored by the market. I am sure that the C919 will become very popular," he said.

search-icon GOD LIFE CULTURE CURRENT PODCAST MAGAZINE STORE ABOUT SUPPORT STORE ADVERTISE CONTACT GOD LIFE CULTURE CURRENT SUBSCRIBE MAGAZINE PODCAST The Signs That You're Going Through a Quarter-Life Crisis What to do about it. BY PAUL SOHN LIFE May 10, 2017 90 TWEET You finally reached your quarter-life, and the struggle is real. There’s an incredible pressure from what stage of life the world thinks you should be in compared to the age you feel inside, making you feel like you jumped into the deep end of a pool, treading water and going nowhere. We call this a quarter-life crisis. Here’s the thing. Your quarter-life crisis doesn’t need to be just a stage to pass over. It’s a transition to embrace, an opportunity to step into your purpose. It’s the perfect time to confront your fears, explore uncharted territory and discover how you are handcrafted and custom-made by a perfect Creator. Here’s some of the tell-tale signs you’re having a quarter-life crisis. You’re starting to question your existence. Why did you put me on this earth, God? What is my freakin’ purpose in life? (of course, in a less morbid way than it sounds). You start avidly going to the self-help section in the bookstore and read books like Purpose-Driven Life. You can’t go on to Facebook, Instagram or Snapchat without seeing another one of your friends getting engaged, married or pregnant. At the same time, you’re still single and there are no potential prospects on the horizon. FOMO is real. You feel your life is full of U-turns and false starts. You can’t handle the overwhelming anxiety, unemployment or underemployment and all that student loans. Your temporary part-time stint at a local coffee shop has lasted over three years … You think you need therapy or counseling, maybe? You can’t pinpoint any problem. You are content with your job. Maybe you’re in good relationship, but something deep inside is nagging you. You have mixed feelings about your faith. You feel both repelled from and compelled to Church. You say you still have your faith. You just don’t have a ton of time to give to it right now, but that day will come again soon. You’re doing “fine.” You suddenly feel like your job is a prison cell. You don’t want to make a career out of your boring 9 to 5 job and the idea of quitting troubles you. You don’t just have a clear backup plan yet and you don’t want to take a leap of faith in ditching it because of the fear of comfort. You Instagram stalk your exes and their exes and their exes’ exes … and the list goes on. You Googled how to be happy, but no article can get you past the depression stage you are in. You feel lost. Wait, you actually have to do your taxes?! You start worrying about things you used to take for granted, like paying your utility bills or having health insurance. Ugh! You’re offended when you are asked for your ID, but even more offended when you are not. You’re reading this article because you Googled: “Quarter-Life Crisis” Every time you visit Forever 21, you feel out of place and too old for this. You wonder what teenagers will think of you. Every single day, you have an internal struggle between being 21-ish and turning into your parents. When you visit your grandma, the first thing out of her mouth is, “When are you going to make me a great-grandma?” So, yeah: You’re having a quarter-life crisis. This happened to me, too. What You Can Do About It I grew up believing in the dangerous myth called the American Dream. That is, if I put in the hard work, I could be anything I wanted to be. The world shouts, “Pursue your passions! Dream big! You can be the very best in what you do.” I deceived myself into thinking I could become the next Steve Jobs, Mark Zuckerberg or Taylor Swift of the world. Success was all about competing—and I wanted to win. It was about who had the most power, prestige, popularity and possessions. I had virtually everything I thought I wanted in my mid-20s. A good salary that afforded an apartment with a jaw-dropping, panoramic view of downtown Portland. A Fortune 50 brand on my resume with incredible potential to climb the corporate ladder. A company that invested in my leadership development and further continuing education. A beautiful girlfriend who always had my back. But I still found myself thoroughly wanting. While my unquenchable desires grew to a crescendo each day, I found myself developing unnerving restlessness, despair and frustration. I was basing my beliefs and values on the wrong things: money, titles, power, temporal and fleeting things that would evaporate when I die. Instead of succumbing to what the world wanted of me, I was prompted to listen to what my Creator wanted in my life. I needed to go through a complete makeover. I needed to redefine how I viewed success based on what Scripture teaches. Like a miner searches for gold, I spent several months diving into the Scriptures every day, looking for how God truly defined success. When I encountered the Parable of the Talents, I knew this was it. The story radically reoriented my view of success. The Parable of the Talents    In the Gospel of Matthew, the Parable of the Talents illustrates a powerful story about how Jesus defines success. The Parable of the Talents teaches that the Kingdom of Heaven will be like a man going on a long voyage. Before He leaves, He gives five talents (a large unit of money) to the first servant, two talents to the second and one talent to the third. Here talents represent a very large sum of money, perhaps millions in today’s currency. Two of the servants earn 100 percent returns by trading with the funds, but the third servant hides the money in the ground and earns nothing. The rich man rewards the two who made money but severely punishes the servant who invested nothing. As we consider this parable, we can interpret talents as resources that God has endowed us with, whether it be time, abilities or treasure. God has a simple standard for measuring success. In His kingdom, success in life is about stewardship and maximizing what we’ve been given. God calls us to be faithful stewards. As a Lean Practitioner at Boeing, I was able to employ stewardship. In fact, I considered my main job function to be one of a steward. My key concern was to evaluate how people were using their time, talent and resources, and to make necessary changes to maximize the efficiency of airplane production. For instance, I examined the number of days it took us to produce a jet, and I would work with teams to see if that number could be cut in half. The question I was always asking was, “How can we make the same airplane in less time for less money?” By working with shop floor team members, we generated productive ideas and solutions to best steward our time, skills and resources to create a better product. However, not all meetings with shop floor members were constructive, as some didn’t possess a vital stewardship mentality but simply viewed their work as a means to a paycheck and never wanted to improve. I like the way the Bible describes stewardship as a profound understanding that we’re not the principal owners of our lives, but managers. Psalm 24:1 declares that “the earth is the Lord’s, and everything in it.” Therefore, the responsibility of a 20-something Christian is the God-given privilege to manage a part of God’s property. In this way, we are stretching ourselves to leverage our abilities, rather than letting them stagnate. Without this perspective, everything we engage in is for the glory of the self, not God. With a true perspective of stewardship, everything is for the glory of God. When you hear the word stewardship, you might quickly grab your wallet either to open it or to hold it more firmly closed. We often equate stewardship as tithing or caring for the environment. But the essence of stewardship is greater than that. Whole-life stewardship involves every choice we make in our lives. In the words of Ron Blue, the essence of stewardship is the “use of God-given resources for the accomplishment of God-given goals.” Stewardship means that we are not owners, but simply managers or administrators. I believe that only through stewardship can someone achieve true success and live a life worth living. As the apostle Paul says, “Moreover, it is required of stewards that they be found faithful” (1 Corinthians 4:2). Paul knew that he would account for the time, talent, and treasure he’d be given by God. The issue is faithfulness. While the word success is rarely used in the Scriptures, the word faithful is used throughout the Bible. Here are several examples from the Bible: ■  “Well done, good and faithful servant!” (Matthew 25:21) ■ “A faithful person will be richly blessed.” (Proverbs 28:20) ■ “The Lamb will triumph over them because He is Lord of lords and King of kings—and with him will be His called, chosen and faithful followers.” (Revelations 17:14) What God requires of you is not success but faithfulness in your calling. Ask yourself, “What has God called me to do?” In what areas in my life can I faithfully steward my time, talent and treasure so I can become the best version of myself ? You aren’t called to change the world, but you are called to follow Jesus in every situation. This requires intentionality, clarity and focus. Will you choose to steward or squander your life? When we define our success according to the quality of our stewardship, this frees us to be ourselves. For a steward, success in life is knowing what God has called you to and being completely faithful to it. When you say yes to Christ, you are comfortable saying no to others. We don’t need to strive to be something we’re not. I have learned that life doesn’t need to be a competition. It’s about becoming the best versions of ourselves. Stewarding our calling inevitably requires us to muster up the courage to say no to the expectations of the world but yes to our Caller. This knowledge has helped me achieve peace and a much greater understanding of my purpose. Bill Peel, executive director of the Center for Work and Faith, wrote, “Although God gives us ‘all things richly to enjoy,’ nothing is ours. Nothing really belongs to us. God owns everything; we’re responsible for how we treat it and what we do with it. While we complain about our rights here on earth, the Bible constantly asks, ‘What about your responsibilities?’ Owners have rights; stewards have responsibilities.” When I was a college freshman, I borrowed my friend’s luxury car for a few days. When I drove him back to his house, I wanted to impress him with my Fast and Furious–like driving skills. I hit the accelerator hard when a stoplight turned green and left a pretty good amount of rubber on the pavement. My friend, who was utterly shocked by my actions, said, “I made a big mistake lending you my car. Get out of the seat, because I’m driving from now on.” It dawned on me that I should have been a good steward of my friend’s property. Instead of abusing my friend’s car, I should have taken great care of what he had entrusted me with. That was the last time my friend ever lent me his car. Likewise, Colossians 3:23 points out that we have a responsibility to exercise stewardship over the God-given resources in our lives. Just like the car I borrowed from my friend, the resources do not belong to us. We were given the privilege and authority to be God’s stewards of his calling in our lives. The truth is that no other period in our lives will be more impacted by the choices we make than our 20s. In our 20s we may choose what grad school to attend, what job to take, where to live, what person to marry and what activities to volunteer for. And stewardship ultimately drives our entire decision-making process. Excerpted from Quarter-Life Calling by Paul Sohn. Used with permission from Faithwords, a division of Hachette Book Group, Inc.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 10 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Arconic’s Director Nominees Share Their Personal Perspectives with Shareholders NEW YORK–(BUSINESS WIRE)–The Board of Directors of Arconic (NYSE: ARNC) today issued a letter to shareholders that includes a Q&A with the Arconic director nominees, in which they share their personal views and their objectives for the Company. Additional information, including the letter to shareholders and supplemental proxy materials, are available at www.arconic.com/annualmeeting. The Company urges shareholders to vote “FOR” the Company’s new slate of five director nominees and governance proposals on the NEW WHITE proxy card. The full text of the letter follows: May 10, 2017 Dear Fellow Shareholder: At Arconic’s upcoming Annual Meeting of Shareholders on May 25, 2017, you will have the opportunity to elect five director candidates nominated by Arconic who we believe bring new perspectives, critical skills and a wealth of relevant expertise to Arconic’s Board of Directors. Three of our candidates are current Board members – none having served for more than 16 months – and two are entirely new and have not yet served on Arconic’s Board. We invite you to hear from the Arconic Director nominees to learn a little more about their personal views and their objectives regarding Arconic. Unanimously, The Board of Directors of Arconic Inc. David P. Hess, Interim CEO Director since: March 2017 Unique Qualifications: Proven aerospace industry leader, with 38 years of industry experience Known for extensive and credible customer relationships across the industry Former EVP and Chief Customer Officer for Aerospace at United Technologies Corp.; Former President of Pratt & Whitney You are Arconic’s newest director and were recently appointed Interim CEO. What has impressed you most about the Company? What do you see as its greatest challenge? I’ve been impressed by how thoroughly engaged and open-minded this Board is, as well as the range and balance of perspectives that the directors collectively bring to bear in our deliberations. Although I’ve only been on the Board for a little over two months, we’ve had numerous board sessions and frequent interactions. This has given me a good opportunity to see the group make some critical decisions and tackle tough issues – including addressing an inappropriate letter sent by our former CEO, recruiting new nominees to fill two open Board seats, contemplating the appropriate timing for the annual meeting in light of fast-changing circumstances, and engaging in settlement discussions with Elliott. I believe if you were in the boardroom along with us, you would observe a group of people who always act with the highest ethics and integrity and always with the best interests of the shareholder in mind. In terms of challenges going forward, perhaps the most critical task for Arconic right now is recruiting a new CEO. We’ve formed a search committee and are starting a deliberate and thorough process to select the perfect candidate with the right experience and capabilities to lead Arconic into the future. At the same time, we must remain relentlessly focused on meeting or exceeding the expectations of our customers and shareholders and on flawlessly executing our three-year plan. I am truly honored to serve as your interim CEO and to be able to lead Arconic through this challenging period. In the short time that I’ve been here at Arconic, I have been very impressed by the dedication of our employees and the support of our customers. With a strong first quarter, we’re off to a great start, and I look forward to what lies ahead. James “Jim” F. Albaugh New Nominee, to join at 2017 Annual Meeting Unique Qualifications: Internationally recognized commercial aerospace executive Former President and CEO, Boeing Commercial Airplanes; Former Member of Boeing’s Executive Council Currently, independent director of American Airlines and Harris Corporation Currently, Chairman of the National Aeronautic Association; Past President of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics; Past Chairman of the Aerospace Industries Association Why did you decide to join the new Arconic slate when it is in the middle of a proxy fight? You must have numerous other opportunities to serve on public company boards. I agreed to join the slate because I believe Arconic is an outstanding company with a strong values-based culture. As the President and CEO of Boeing’s Commercial Airplanes business, I experienced first-hand what it means to be one of Arconic’s customers. The Company stood out to me as a true partner that invests in growing areas and innovative technologies, and I believe the reputation and culture that Arconic has built up over time gives it a strong foundation for future growth. In addition, as a newly launched, standalone company, Arconic now has a more streamlined set of businesses with a strong focus on the aerospace and transportation industries. Given my background, this felt like an ideal opportunity for me to contribute my knowledge and expertise to a company where it is directly relevant and hopefully will have a real impact. I spent almost my entire career in the aerospace sector, and my perspective has been shaped not only by my years at Boeing but also as Chairman of the National Aeronautic Association and in my prior roles as President of the American Institute of Aeronautic and Astronautics and Chairman of the Aerospace Industries Association. I’ve had the opportunity to discuss the future of the commercial aerospace industry with a number of leaders, and I’m excited to help Arconic realize its full potential. Amy E. Alving Director since: November 2016 Committees: Audit Committee; Cybersecurity Advisory Subcommittee (Chair) Unique Qualifications: In depth technology, defense, and engineering expertise PhD in Mechanical & Aerospace Engineering Successful public company board track record You are new to the Board, having joined last November upon the launch of Arconic as a standalone company, following its separation from Alcoa Corp. What is it like to be part of a company going through so much change? We do have a lot of change underway – governance changes at the Board and CEO level, and operational changes as we are able to focus on our core business, post-separation. From my experience on other boards I know that, when making tough decisions, access to a diverse set of views is key to finding the best path. This Board was carefully constructed to include a wide range of experiences and perspectives. Arconic’s Board is a bit unique in that seven of us have joined in the past 16 months, and we are fortunate to benefit from the knowledge of the four directors with longer tenure. Personally, I am especially attracted to Arconic’s emphasis on technology and innovation, which have been the focus of my career. I served as the Director of the Special Projects Office at the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), where we developed breakthrough innovations in support of national security. Later I was the Chief Technology Officer at one of the nation’s largest defense contractors. I know that successful innovation at a large company requires alignment from the boardroom through management to the front-line technologists, and it requires close, iterative collaboration with customers to ensure appropriate return on investment. From my experience in the defense and financial services sector, I also understand the evolving cyber security threat that Arconic is facing. As Arconic increases its criticality in the national-security supply chain, its Board will need to ensure the Company stays ahead of this threat. Ulrich R. Schmidt Director since: February 2016 Committees: Audit Committee (Chair); Executive Committee; Governance and Nominating Committee; Finance Committee Unique Qualifications: Extensive executive and business experience at the board and CFO level Deep knowledge of the aerospace industry, including as Former EVP and CFO of Spirit Aerosystems Holdings, Inc. and separately, Goodrich Corporation Served as chairman of Precision Castparts Audit Committee You were suggested for the Arconic Board by Elliott last year – how has your integration into the Board gone? Elliott obviously has confidence in your judgment and perspective as a director (it is not contesting your election this year) – with that in mind, do you feel that Elliott’s criticisms of the Board are warranted? Following my appointment to the Board, together with the other two directors who were also nominated by Elliott last year, it was immediately apparent that everyone on the Board has a voice and their views are respected. Our meetings are characterized by open debate, a free flow of ideas and the shared goal of doing what is right for the Company and the shareholders. So to answer your first question, the integration was seamless and there was no “us versus them” mentality or other tension between the Elliott nominees and the rest of the Board. Regarding your second question – I don’t believe Elliott’s criticisms of the Board and its culture are supported by the facts. I have found that the Board is thoroughly engaged, values strong governance and the highest standards of ethical behavior, and actively evaluates and embraces changes that it believes make sense for the Company and are in the best interests of all constituents. Many of the governance changes that have recently been adopted were being contemplated prior to or in connection with the separation, well before Elliott launched its proxy fight. Janet C. Wolfenbarger New Nominee, to join at 2017 Annual Meeting Unique Qualifications: In depth defense knowledge; 35-year veteran and first female four-star general of U.S. Air Force Former lead procurement officer for U.S. Air Force, a major Arconic customer Independent director of AECOM since August 2015 As the Air Force’s first female four-star general, what makes you want to take on the challenge of serving on the Arconic Board? I’ve been fortunate to serve with exceptional teams throughout my career, both in the Air Force and post retirement, in my corporate board and federal advisory committee work, and I’ve been impressed with the caliber of the people who serve at Arconic. During my 35-year tenure in the U.S. Air Force, I oversaw an approximately $60 billion annual budget, including purchasing, which covered a large portion of the approximately $1 billion of business that Arconic does in the defense industry. Arconic operates in an important and very competitive industry, and it stands out to me as a leader in the space. Not only because the Company offers leading innovative technologies, but also because Arconic puts in the effort to maintain a dialogue with its customers in order to better understand and adapt to their wants and needs. I also have experienced firsthand the complexities that surround organizational transformations, which I feel gives me some insight into Arconic – itself the product of a transformation that is still underway. I understand that an ongoing commitment to excellence, efficiency, and cost effectiveness is integral to any organization’s success, particularly in the early years, and feel Arconic’s strategy of focusing its efforts on high-potential areas reflects that.   Your Vote Is Important, No Matter How Many or How Few Shares You Own   Please vote today by telephone, via the Internet or by signing, dating and returning the enclosed NEW WHITE proxy card.

I know that successful innovation at a large company requires alignment from the boardroom through management to the front-line technologists, and it requires close, iterative collaboration with customers to ensure appropriate return on investment. From my experience in the defense and financial services sector, I also understand the evolving cyber security threat that Arconic is facing. As Arconic increases its criticality in the national-security supply chain, its Board will need to ensure the Company stays ahead of this threat. Ulrich R. Schmidt Director since: February 2016 Committees: Audit Committee (Chair); Executive Committee; Governance and Nominating Committee; Finance Committee Unique Qualifications: Extensive executive and business experience at the board and CFO level Deep knowledge of the aerospace industry, including as Former EVP and CFO of Spirit Aerosystems Holdings, Inc. and separately, Goodrich Corporation Served as chairman of Precision Castparts Audit Committee You were suggested for the Arconic Board by Elliott last year  how has your integration into the Board gone? Elliott obviously has confidence in your judgment and perspective as a director (it is not contesting your election this year)  with that in mind, do you feel that Elliotts criticisms of the Board are warranted? Following my appointment to the Board, together with the other two directors who were also nominated by Elliott last year, it was immediately apparent that everyone on the Board has a voice and their views are respected. Our meetings are characterized by open debate, a free flow of ideas and the shared goal of doing what is right for the Company and the shareholders. So to answer your first question, the integration was seamless and there was no "us versus them mentality or other tension between the Elliott nominees and the rest of the Board. Regarding your second question  I don't believe Elliotts criticisms of the Board and its culture are supported by the facts. I have found that the Board is thoroughly engaged, values strong governance and the highest standards of ethical behavior, and actively evaluates and embraces changes that it believes make sense for the Company and are in the best interests of all constituents. Many of the governance changes that have recently been adopted were being contemplated prior to or in connection with the separation, well before Elliott launched its proxy fight. Janet C. Wolfenbarger New Nominee, to join at 2017 Annual Meeting Unique Qualifications: In depth defense knowledge; 35-year veteran and first female four-star general of U.S. Air Force Former lead procurement officer for U.S. Air Force, a major Arconic customer Independent director of AECOM since August 2015 As the Air Forces first female four-star general, what makes you want to take on the challenge of serving on the Arconic Board? Ive been fortunate to serve with exceptional teams throughout my career, both in the Air Force and post retirement, in my corporate board and federal advisory committee work, and Ive been impressed with the caliber of the people who serve at Arconic. During my 35-year tenure in the U.S. Air Force, I oversaw an approximately $60 billion annual budget, including purchasing, which covered a large portion of the approximately $1 billion of business that Arconic does in the defense industry. Arconic operates in an important and very competitive industry, and it stands out to me as a leader in the space. Not only because the Company offers leading innovative technologies, but also because Arconic puts in the effort to maintain a dialogue with its customers in order to better understand and adapt to their wants and needs. I also have experienced firsthand the complexities that surround organizational transformations, which I feel gives me some insight into Arconic  itself the product of a transformation that is still underway. I understand that an ongoing commitment to excellence, efficiency, and cost effectiveness is integral to any organizations success, particularly in the early years, and feel Arconics strategy of focusing its efforts on high-potential areas reflects that.   Your Vote Is Important, No Matter How Many or How Few Shares You Own   Please vote today by telephone, via the Internet or by signing, dating and returning the enclosed NEW WHITE proxy card.

Credit: NASA If NASA and its partner agencies are serious about putting boots on Mars in the near future, they should pull the plug on the International Space Station (ISS) at the earliest opportunity, Buzz Aldrin said. "We must retire the ISS as soon as possible," the former Apollo 11 moonwalker said Tuesday (May 9) during a presentation at the 2017 Humans to Mars conference in Washington, D.C. "We simply cannot afford $3.5 billion a year of that cost." Instead, Aldrin said, NASA should continue to hand over activities in low Earth orbit (LEO) to private industry partners. Indeed, the space agency has been encouraging that move by awarding contracts to companies such as SpaceX, Orbital ATK and Boeing to ferry cargo and crew to and from the ISS. [Buzz Aldrin's Visions for Mars (Video)] Bigelow Aerospace, Axiom Space or other companies should build and operate LEO space stations that are independent of the ISS, he added. Ideally, the first of these commercial outposts would share key orbital parameters with the station that China plans to have up and running by the early 2020s, to encourage cooperation with the Chinese, Aldrin said. Establishing private outposts in LEO is just the first step in Aldrin's plan for Mars colonization, which depends heavily on "cyclers" — spacecraft that move continuously between two cosmic destinations, efficiently delivering people and cargo back and forth. "The foundation of human transportation is the cycler," the 87-year-old former astronaut said. "Very rugged, so it'll last 30 years or so; no external moving parts." Step two involves the international spaceflight community coming together to build cyclers that ply cislunar space, taking people on trips to the moon and back. Such spacecraft, and the activities they enable, would allow the construction of a crewed lunar base, where humanity could learn and test the techniques required for Mars colonization, such as how to manufacture propellant from local resources, Aldrin said. Then would come Earth-Mars cyclers, which Aldrin described as "an evolutionary development" of the prior cyclers. Aldrin foresees these various cycler iterations enabling a crewed mission to a near-Earth asteroid by 2020 and a Venus flyby by 2024. If all goes well, the first future Mars settlers could launch in the early 2030s, he said. And they will be settlers, not just visitors, if Aldrin's vision comes to pass. "Let's be certain that we've developed a sustainable plan to stay on Mars," he said. "No flags and footprints this time." The ISS is currently funded through 2024, and officials of NASA, the Russian federal space agency and other partners have floated the possibility of extending the $100 billion outpost's life through 2028. NASA officials have repeatedly said that the ISS is a key part of the agency's "Journey to Mars" vision, which aims to get astronauts to the vicinity of the Red Planet sometime in the 2030s.

across Africa sat together with investors and the private sector to determine how best to tackle the investment and credit risk hurdles in order to make African risks bankable. Participants to the roundtable see the event as timely because it comes at time of geopolitical uncertainties which, according to The World Bank, could lead to “higher borrowing costs or cut off capital flows to emerging and frontier markets”. For African governments part of what is at stake are much needed foreign direct investments and access to affordable financing necessary to spur development and, specifically, to close the estimated USD900 billion infrastructure gap. Equally, the private sector stands to lose billions of dollars in lost opportunities if the requirements for a favourable investment environment are not adequately addressed. The half day forum, the 4th roundtable to focus on Political and Credit Risks in Africa, took place on the side lines of the African Trade Insurance Agency’s ATI annual general meetings. The event opened with pointed remarks from Patrice Talon, president of Benin. Subsequent discussions focused on possible solutions to the challenges facing governments from the private sector and export credit agencies from panellists such as: Patrick Chinamasa, Minister of Finance & Economic Development, Zimbabwe Romuald Wadagni, Minister of Economy & Finance, Benin Felix Mutati, Minister of Finance, Zambia Chamsou Andjorin, Director Government Affairs & Market Development, Boeing Intl. Helen Mtshali, Syndication Lead – Sub-Saharan Africa, Industrial Finance Solutions, GE Nisrin Hala, Sr. Director, Global Trade Finance Bus. Devpt. Emerging Markets, SMBC Investors are not immune to political and social developments in emerging regions like Africa. In fact, with reduced earnings – the benchmark emerging-market stock index has lost approximately 4 percent annually since 2010 from a high of 22 percent annual return in the preceding decade – investors are now focusing on more than the bottom line in these markets. During the boom years of the last two decades, Africa was experiencing unprecedented GDP growth rates but depressed commodity prices have seen growth in the sub-Saharan Africa region slow to 1.5 percent rate in 2016. According to World Bank estimates, oil exporters account for most of the slowdown owing to their two-thirds contribution to regional output. In a Bloomberg article published in March 2016, emerging market investors from some of the most prominent companies noted the dramatic change in their investing tactics due to global fragility, which they see as unveiling institutional weakness, corruption, poor governance and efficiencies. In this current climate, investors are now keenly tracking social indicators such as corruption rankings, gender parity and the extent that rule of law is respected within emerging markets. “Africa is in a period of realignment in this new global order but I don’t think anyone should bet against its resilience. We are still home to some of the fastest growing economies in the world – as of 2017, the World Economic Forum ranks Côte d’Ivoire, Tanzania and Senegal on the list of the top ten fastest growing economies in the world,” George Otieno, ATI’s CEO, said. In this climate, it is more imperative than ever for African governments to focus on economic diversity to maintain growth while addressing risks to investors. As an internationally respected African institution, the African Trade Insurance Agency (ATI) offers the ideal solution precisely because the company has strong relationships with governments and because its risk assessments and mitigation solutions are seen as credible by global financiers and investors. With ATI involved in a transaction, governments are able to provide security to investors and suppliers against a range of investment risks. In 2016, ATI insured close to USD2 billion (KES202.8 billion) worth of trade and investments and the company is increasingly supporting some of the continent’s most important transactions such as Ethiopian Airline’s fleet expansion and a USD660 million investment in Lake Turkana, Africa’s largest wind farm and, to date, the single largest investment in Kenya. In this environment, ATI’s products are being seen as a valuable tool to enable lenders to take sub-investment grade risk in Africa thus allowing governments and corporates to access more affordable financing. Importantly, in its role as an investment insurer of last resort, ATI is also providing the necessary comfort to support continued investments into the continent amidst a period of uncertainty. —  May 10, 2017 @ 17:50 GMT No Comments Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

Bras The Love Family Foundation Scholarship goes each year to a member of the graduating class with the most outstanding scholastic record. This year, the $10,000 scholarship provided by the Gay and Erskine Love Foundation went to Georgie Tzintzarov, an electrical and computer engineering major, and Charles M. Wang, a chemistry and computer science major. Students in all six of Georgia Tech’s colleges are considered for the award. Both students have maintained a 4.0 GPA while engaging in multiple academic enrichment activities outside of normal coursework. The two received the award at the annual Student Honors Celebration on April 20. Tzintzarov held summer internships at Cisco and Boeing, and he has worked as a co-op student in the Georgia Tech Research Institute’s Electronic Systems Lab. He was able to get a taste of research in two different labs during his undergraduate career. He worked in Professor Ayanna Howard’s Human-Automation Systems (HumAnS) Lab through the Opportunity Research Scholars (ORS) program and was later an undergraduate research assistant in Professor John Cressler’s Silicon-Germanium Devices and Circuits Lab. Propelled by his exposure to undergraduate research, Tzintzarov is now pursuing a Ph.D. degree with a focus on microelectronics/microsystems with Professor Cressler as his advisor. Outside of the lab, Tzintzarov is a member of Sigma Phi Epsilon fraternity and led efforts to improve his fraternity’s academic performance while maintaining a healthy and balanced lifestyle. He hopes to inspire his brothers to be great leaders both at Georgia Tech and in life. Given his numerous accomplishments, perhaps the most impressive part of Tzintzarov’s journey is where it began—in a small town in Eastern Europe. Below he expounds on his “American Genesis” story and how his upbringing made him the man he is today. Read more about Tzintzarov. Funded by a President’s Undergraduate Research Award, Wang worked with Josephine Yu, an assistant professor in the School of Mathematics. The undergraduate research has yielded two articles co-authored by Wang. “Generalized Permutohedra from Probabilistic Graphical Models” has been posted on arXiv.org and is under review for publication in the SIAM Journal on Discrete Mathematics. Another research article, “Toric h-vectors and Chow Betti Numbers of Dual Hypersimplices,” is in preparation. “Charles has a rare combination of curiosity, perseverance, and mathematical and computational ability, which makes him an ideal research student,” Yu said. “I have every reason to believe that he will succeed in graduate school and beyond.” Wang’s fondness for mathematics has taken him to Hungary, where he participated in Georgia Tech’s Budapest Semester in Mathematics Program and to North Carolina, Germany, and Finland to attend mathematical research summer workshops. He will pursue a Ph.D. in mathematics at the University of California, Berkeley. Read more about Wang.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 10 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman The Dassault Systèmes U.S. Foundation Provides Grant to Base 11 to Develop Engineering Talent IRVINE, Calif. & WALTHAM, Mass.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–The Dassault Systèmes U.S. Foundation and Base 11 today announced a workforce development initiative focused on training the next generation of engineers with the skills most in-demand by aerospace, high-tech and transportation industries. With a grant from The Foundation, the initiative will provide students with training in collaborative 3-D engineering design platforms used by many large employers including Boeing, Northrup Grumman, Lockheed Martin, Tesla, Honda, HP and IBM. “We are thrilled by the grant from The Dassault Systèmes U.S. Foundation as it will accelerate our ability to empower our academic partners with the tools and resources they need to transform high-potential, low-resource students into 21st century STEM leaders,” said Landon Taylor, CEO of Base 11, a nonprofit STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) workforce development and entrepreneur accelerator. The initiative will be piloted this summer at the University of California, Irvine’s Samueli School of Engineering with community college students participating in the Base 11 summer fellowship program being the first to receive training on the collaborative 3-D design solutions. “This workforce development initiative by Base 11 speaks to the huge demand for trained talent that we’re hearing from employers,” said Al Bunshaft, President, The Dassault Systèmes U.S. Foundation. “We are excited to support this innovative initiative that aims to create new educational content with the learning and discovery capabilities of 3D technology and virtual universes. This will offer a solution for employers, while simultaneously changing the lives of underserved students and their communities.” The Autonomous Systems Engineering Academy was based on a highly successful freshman engineering course at the Samueli School of Engineering featuring hands-on, project-based learning. In 2015, Base 11 funded an adaptation of the course as an 8-week residency based summer program geared toward high-potential, low-resource community college students. The inaugural cohort of that program was recruited from across the country and completed the program at UCI in the summer of 2016. (See video here.) The academy focuses around hands-on, interactive projects that encompass multiple engineering disciplines. Students learn the basics of aerospace design, computer aided design, 3-D printing, basic electronics and fabrication techniques through a series of mini projects. Each of those mini projects is a necessary component of the final capstone project, which is a fully operational unmanned aerial vehicle, or drone. In the first phase of the initiative, funded by The Dassault Systèmes U.S. Foundation, the process of designing the drone will be enhanced by access to and training on 3-D design platforms used by engineers at major corporations. Beginning January 2018, Base 11 will expand the ASEA curriculum into a full academic-year college credit-bearing engineering course at three community college campuses in Orange County, California, San Francisco and Phoenix including Orange Coast College, Skyline College and South Mountain Community College, with the potential to reach other markets in 2019. “The partnership with Base 11 and the financial support of The Dassault Systèmes U.S. Foundation is helping us expand our reach into community colleges and high schools, advancing our mission to prepare future engineers for matriculation at UCI and on to successful STEM-based careers,” said Gregory Washington, Stacey Nicholas dean of engineering, Samueli School. About Base 11 Base 11 is a nonprofit workforce development accelerator focused on solving the STEM talent pipeline crisis being fueled by the underrepresentation of women and minorities. Base 11 facilitates partnerships with industry, academia and philanthropy which deliver to employers a pre-recruitment pipeline of well-trained, highly skilled STEM talent. By establishing Innovation Centers integrated with hands-on project based learning and STEM entrepreneurship training, Base 11 and its partners set students on direct pathways to four-year STEM degrees, well paid STEM jobs, and the opportunity to launch their own STEM related business.

Developed by a consortium led by the University of Strathclyde's Advanced Forming Research Centre (AFRC) and the Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre with Boeing (AMRC) in Sheffield, the technology was first trialled on a 2.2 metre plasterboard wall which, when viewed with a Microsoft HoloLens, showed a 3D rendering of the plumbing and wiring behind the facade. 800 jobs to go as Aberdeen Asset Management and Standard Life merge The system can also be used to examine different wall parts to ensure there are no gaps in insulation before being sent to a construction site, cutting on costs and saving time. David Grant, partnership development leader at the AFRC , said the technology has a role to play before, during and after construction of both domestic and commercial properties. “It could help during a build as contractors will be able to accurately see what's behind walls and under floors, potentially leading to improved health and safety on sites as all guess work could be eliminated,” he explained.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 10 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman How AI is Reinventing the Design of Planes, Trains and Automobiles Deep learning is coming to 3D design. Just ask Dassault Systèmes. The company’s 3DExperience Platform is used for everything from Tesla cars and Boeing airplanes to Procter & Gamble consumer products. Now, it’s amping up 3D design and simulation with deep learning and GPUs. “What people have done with  deep learning for image and speech recognition, we’re doing to transform how products are designed and experienced,” said Patrick Johnson, vice president for corporate research at the 3D modeling software company. AI by Design Traditionally, designers and engineers had to start each new product from scratch. With NVIDIA GPUs and deep learning, Dassault will soon be able to harness the history of previous designs. The system’s 3Dbots use this knowledge to predict and propose a whole new range of designs in a exploratory innovation space. Romain Perron, R&D web apps and services director for Dassault’s flagship CATIA brand, will illustrate those cognitive augmented design 3Dbots in more detail on Thursday at GTC “From there, you just select the ones you want for faster and better design leveraging know-how and past designs,” Johnson said. Engineers can use the company’s software to plan the ideal manufacturing process and see how their design will function in the real world. Shipmaker Meyerwerft used Dassaullt Systemes’ GPU-powered 3D design software to create this ship, which has 300,000 different parts. 3D Design at GTC The company is out in force at the GPU Technology Conference, with three sessions upcoming about how it’s using deep learning, virtual and augmented reality, and NVIDIA Iray rendering software to advance 3D modeling: Enterprise AR: Industry Opportunities and Technology Challenges – Wednesday, May 10, 4:30 p.m., Room 230A Homebyme: How Iray, VCA, Deep Learning and VR Helps You Experience Your New Apartment –  Thursday, May 11, 9 a.m., Room 230C Cognitive Augmented Design with AI-Powered 3DExperience – Thursday, May 11, 11 a.m., Room 230C To learn more about how AI computing is transforming industries, watch for replays of these and other talks from the GPU Technology Conference, May 8-11, in Silicon Valley.

(Cliff Jette/The Gazette) Jim Slosiarek/The Gazette Jean Johnson, with her twins, Mackenzie and Andrew, pose Thursday at the Clark Alumni House at Coe College in Cedar Rapids. The two will be graduating later this month from Coe, where their mother has been the longtime director of alumni programs. She will be handing them their diplomas and then, this fall, will be retiring after 28 years with the private college. Vanessa Miller The Gazette More stories from Vanessa May 9, 2017 at 3:22 pm | Print View Over the next few weekends, thousands of college and university students will don traditional gowns, cross their respective stages and turn the symbolic tassels during graduation ceremonies across Eastern Iowa. This year’s crop of commencements includes several records, firsts, lasts and big names. Dennis Muilenburg, chairman, president and CEO of The Boeing Company, will speak during Iowa State University’s undergraduate commencement Saturday. The University of Iowa meanwhile will award two honorary degrees — one to billionaire businessman and philanthropist Ted Waitt, who co-founded Gateway Inc., and another to wellness innovator Martin-Jose Sepulveda, who spent decades at IBM developing employee health and wellness programs. Muilenburg’s address will go out to another record-breaking class at Iowa State, which for the second year is holding its undergraduate ceremony in Jack Trice Stadium to accommodate the growing body of graduates, family members and friends. Iowa State expects 5,093 graduation candidates, including 4,322 bachelor’s, 497 master’s and 133 doctoral candidates plus 141 veterinary medicine graduates. The UI’s anticipated graduate total is 4,839 — which is above last May’s 4,738 but not a record. In May 2015, for example, the registrar’s office reported 4,916 degrees. The University of Northern Iowa expects to graduate about 1,700 students, including 400 graduate students and 1,300 undergraduates. The university last year reported 1,625 graduate, up from 1,464 in 2015. And while those statistics paint the big picture of growing class sizes that are, perhaps, moving through at a faster clip, they miss the trials and triumphs that permeate the stories of every robed degree-recipient who’ll march across the stage this month. Here are two of their stories. MOVING FROM SYRIA TO IOWA: 'THE RIGHT DECISION' An Arabic saying kept ringing through Mousa Abuissa’s mind. “One bird in hand is better than 10 on the tree,” he said. “Basically, if you have something certain in your hand, you shouldn’t throw it and hope for 10.” In 2009, Abuissa felt he had something certain. The then-19-year-old Syrian was well on his way to finishing a music and economics degree at Damascus University. The conflict that would envelop his homeland had not year begun. His parents and sister were rooted nearby. But, on an October 2009 visit to his aunt and uncle in Iowa City, something clicked for Abuissa. His aunt showed him around the UI campus. She took him to the College of Pharmacy — he had always wanted to pursue pharmacy, like so many others in his family. Although he had a return ticket booked for December, Abuissa never used it. He made the difficult decision to transfer his college credits, leave behind his family, home and belongings, and apply to the UI. “I was really torn,” Abuissa told The Gazette. “I wasn’t sure if I was making the right decision. I could be throwing my degree away back home.” Of course, one year later, war broke out in Syria, and Abuissa was glad he took the chance on Iowa City. Among the university’s selling points was its dual strengths in the arts and sciences, given that Abuissa was studying the cello back in Syria but had visions of a pharmacy career. He completed his undergraduate degree in music at the UI in 2013 — borrowing a cello for a while. He then immediately enrolled in the UI College of Pharmacy graduate program, taking English classes along the way and earning his citizenship. Two years after the Syrian conflict started, his parents sent over his younger sister, who also enrolled at the UI. She, too, became a U.S. citizen. “Thankfully,” Abuissa noted. “Got that done before crazy things started happening.” He didn’t return to Syria for a visit until 2015. And yet, despite the oceans and continents that divide them, Abuissa has woven Syria and its turmoil into his Iowa City life. “My morning routine — wake up, grab the laptop, go to the news things while the coffee is making, read all the depressing stories, and then get some coffee and move on with my day,” he said. “But I do have at least 20 to 30 minutes in the morning, just for that.” He continues to check throughout the day. “In a way, I’m addicted,” he said. “But I have to know.” His parents are relatively safe in the capital city, he said. And, despite some of the international travel challenges at present, his dad is in Iowa City for a visit, just in time to see his two Hawkeye transplants graduate. Abuissa, 27, has earned a doctor of pharmacy degree. Natali Abuissa, 25, has earned an undergraduate degree in economics. And although Mousa Abuissa said he’d like to try out a U.S. metropolis for a while — he’s applied to jobs in San Francisco and Minneapolis — he’s not necessarily leaving Iowa City for good. “I want to go to bigger cities, get some experience and then potentially come back,” he said. COE MOTHER, COE KIDS: ‘IN THEIR BLOOD’ Eight weeks after giving birth to boy-girl twins, Jean Johnson was attending a homecoming dinner in downtown Cedar Rapids in her official capacity as director of alumni programs for Coe College. The event was in a hotel, and Johnson’s niece was watching her infants in a room upstairs. But everyone at the party began asking about the twins, requesting she bring them down. “They got to go to their first reunion dinner, just to do a lap of introduction, when they were just babies,” Johnson said. “So it’s in their blood.” She means, perhaps, the twins — Mackenzie and Andrew Johnson — were destined to become Kohawks. And this Sunday they’ll both receive their Coe degrees from the person who introduced them to campus. “I get to hand them their diplomas,” Johnson said. “They’ll say, ‘Presenting Andrew’s diploma is his mother, Director of Alumni Programs Jean Johnson. And then I get to hand it, shake his hand, hug him, get a picture and then the president will probably shake his hand, and off he goes.” One other Johnson slips in alphabetically before Mackenzie. “I probably should just grab her and have triplets,” Johnson said. The moment will be a big one for Mackenzie and Andrew, who Johnson said now have a leg up on her, given that she’s worked for Coe for decades but didn’t earn a degree from the private college. “I’m very proud they’re Coe graduates,” she said. “It’s a meaningful name to have on your resume.” But this season also brings significance for Johnson, who’ll be retiring as one of the longest-serving alumni program directors in Coe history. “I think I’ve done my 28 years,” Johnson, 61, said about why she’s stepping away now. “I keep saying my brain is full of names, places, years, and connections.” Johnson shepherded Coe’s alumni program over the years through key milestones and societal shifts — including technological advancements that have made social media paramount in networking. But one significant promise she made good on was providing a consistent face for graduated Kohawks. “They were looking for longevity,” she said, noting relationship-building opportunities increase the longer an alumni director sticks around. “It’s the more people you know.” The alumni pool has grown during Johnson’s time. from about 13,000 to more than 15,000. Its student body has swelled from about 1,000 to more than 1,400. Johnson’s official leave date is Sept. 1, but with so much institutional knowledge and deep connections, her departure will be a process. “Our biggest time is homecoming,” she said “So I’m going to help them get started with it.” UPCOMING GRADUATION CEREMONIES This weekend — University of Iowa: https://registrar.uiowa.edu/may-2017-ceremonies-and-events — Cornell College: cornellcollege.edu/commencement/schedule-of-events/index.shtml — Kirkwood Community College: kirkwood.edu/commencementlive May 20 and 21 — Mount Mercy University: mtmercy.edu/commencement l Comments: (319) 339-3158; vanessa.miller@thegazette.com Like what you're reading?

Business News Home > Business > Business News < Back to SMG 45 Thursday, 11 May 2017 | MYT 9:30 AM KLCI surges early Thursday, Petronas stocks lead by joseph chin KUALA LUMPUR: Blue chips jumped early Thursday underpinned by gains in Petronas-linked stocks after crude oil prices rebounded while Public Bank chalked up some gains, as Bursa Malaysia tracked the key Asian markets higher. At 9.19am, the KLCI was up 11.19 points or 0.63% to 1,777.75. Turnover was 354.02 million shares valued at RM191.56mil. There were 333 gainers, 90 losers and 264 counters unchanged. Asian stocks rose early on Thursday, getting a lift from a record high close on MSCI's global stocks benchmark after strong gains in oil prices buoyed energy stocks globally, Reuters reported. Oil prices held on to 3% plus overnight gains, their biggest one-day jump since Dec 1, following a steep drop in US inventories and support from Iraq and Algeria for an extension to OPEC supply cuts. US crude rose 0.1% to US$47.41 although some market watchers warned the gains in prices may be short-lived given stubbornly high US production, said Reuters. Hong Leong Investment Bank (HLIB) Research said that Wall Street may continue its mixed trading sentiments as investors are waiting for further details on Trump's policy before buying aggressively into the markets. The Dow's upside might be limited around 21,000-21,178. At Bursa Malaysia, it said the oil and gas (O&G) sector could see trading interest on the back of recovering Brent crude oil prices above US$50.  “However, KLCI's upside could be limited around 1,770-1,780 as market participants could be tuning to the wait-and-see mode ahead of the Prime Minister’s visit to China on May 14-15,” it said. Petronas Gas rose 46 sen to RM18.96 and Petronas Dagangan added 28 sen to RM24.28. Petron Malaysia continued to attract strong buying interest, up 30 sen to RM8.27.  HLFG added 36 sen to RM17.86 and Public Bank was up 14 sen to RM20.12. BAT rose 26 sen to RM45.28 and Heineken 14 sen higher at RM18.26. IW City, which was hammered over the past two trading days, eked out gains of seven sen to RM1.68. It was actively traded with 29.34 million shares done. Pentamaster fell the most, down 17 sen to RM3.33, Gas Malaysia lost eght sen to RM3.02 and Rev Asia was down six sen to 83.5 sen.   Tags / Keywords: Stocks , Markets Related Stories You May Be Interested CIMB Research retains Hold for Hartalega, ups target price Maybank IB: Higher cess is negative on Ta Ann’s earnings Lazada offers offline payment services in stores nationwide Private investments in ECER to hit RM110bil this year Indonesia ministry seeks to extend forest moratorium by two years Seven reasons to get an iPhone now Others Also Read Wallabies Beale, Genia might be rested for June tests Couple, hotel manager charged with human trafficking Uber says to partner with taxis in Myanmar expansion drive Property Related advertisement Latest News Macquarie-led group buys Australia's Endeavour Energy for US$5.6b Exxon Mobil buys Singapore petrochemical plant, boosts output in Asia Japan competes with China, makes sales pitch to win Malaysia-Singapore rail project Potentially stronger earnings for Gas Malaysia in 2H17 Lazada offers offline payment services in stores nationwide Most Viewed in Business Astro launches NJOI Now Malindo goes global Boeing suspends 737 MAX flights due to engine issue KLCI up nearly 12 points at midday, IW City stages mild rebound Lazada offers offline payment services in stores nationwide Japan competes with China, makes sales pitch to win Malaysia-Singapore rail project YTL Power impasse ends Owner of Malaysia Airlines names top execs of 'Project Hope' Potential game changer - palm kernal made into chicken feed OCBC agrees to buy National Australia Bank Asian wealth units advertisement advertisement site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Lifestyle Tech Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services Magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs Advertising View Our Rate Card Policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu StarProperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com Search The Star Online Connect with us Content Partner Our Radio Stations site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Tech Lifestyle Travel Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs advertising View Our Rate Card policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu starproperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com social media Facebook Twitter Copyright © 1995- Star Media Group Berhad (ROC 10894D)

Analysts were surprised markets didn’t react more to the Comey firing, which has raised echoes of Watergate, the 1970s political scandal that ended Richard Nixon’s presidency. The FBI is investigating Russian ties to the White House, and Comey had reportedly asked for more funds to pursue the case. “The big story of the day really is the market is taking the Comey firing pretty well, considering it further decreases the prospects for tax reform, infrastructure spending, any sort of stimulus,” said Karl Haeling of LBBW. European stocks, meanwhile, posted slight gains, with some analysts detecting an investment flow from across the Atlantic. “The latest surfacing of the unpredictable side of Trump adds further weight to renewed investor confidence in European stocks,” said Accendo Markets analyst Henry Croft. Bourses ended a touch higher in Paris and Frankfurt, while surging oil prices helped lift London by 0.6 per cent. Higher oil prices also helped boost Dow members ExxonMobil and Chevron, but it was not enough to keep the blue-chip index positive. It finished down 0.2 per cent. Disney was the biggest loser in the blue-chip index, shedding 2.2 per cent on worries about its ESPN sports network, while Boeing fell 2.0 per cent on news it suspended flight tests of its new 737 plane because of engine problems. But the Nasdaq ended 0.1 per cent higher, finishing at its fourth-straight record. The S&P 500 also put on 0.1 per cent. Markets shrug off firing Analysts said the broader takeaway from the market’s reaction was that investors were not ready to throw in the towel on tax cuts and other Trump led measures that have boosted stocks. The Comey firing “is definitely a distraction, yet it is most definitely not being thought of at this juncture as a tax reform deal killer,” said Briefing.com analyst Patrick O’Hare in a note before the market opened, when stock futures pointed to modest losses in the US. “Those embers continue to burn.  Had they been extinguished by the news of Comey’s firing, the futures would be down more than they are — a lot more.” Others said the market was focused less on Washington policy and more on corporate earnings, which have generally bested expectations. “Broadly speaking I do not think this really changes much — not unless it’s the start of a Watergate-like scandal,” said ETX Capital analyst Neil Wilson. “Solid corporate earnings... ought to underpin continued equity strength for time being. I don’t think this will wake investors from their slumber yet.” London Capital Group analyst Ipek Ozkardeskaya said, “The abrupt dismissal has been a shock for many, for whom the news has been perceived as tragic for the US democracy. “But the markets have no hard feelings and they are way more pragmatic,” she added.

Healthcare and industrial stocks lagged. WTI crude oil for June delivery settled at $47.33 a barrel, up 3.2% on the day, it’s biggest one-day gain since November. June gold added 0.2% for the day to settle at $1,218.90. Equities were headed for a mixed close shortly before the bell as the DJIA traded down 0.16% for the day, the S&P 500 traded up 0.07%, and the Nasdaq Composite traded up 0.05%. Stocks traded very near the break-even line just minutes before the closing bell. The closing tally could finish with either a small gain or a small loss for any or all of the indexes. The DJIA stock posting the largest daily percentage loss ahead of the close Wednesday was The Walt Disney Co. (NYSE: DIS) which traded down 2.55% at $109.225. The stock’s 52-week range is $90.32 to $116.10. Volume was well above double the daily average of around 5.7 million shares. The company missed revenue estimates Tuesday afternoon along with other troubles in ESPN subscriber numbers. The Boeing Co. (NYSE: BA) traded down 1.32% at $183.05.

The price of US crude oil jumped 3% as fuel stockpiles kept shrinking, and that made investors more optimistic about energy company profits. Strong earnings from video game maker Electronic Arts and chip maker Nvidia helped technology stocks move up. However, weak results from Priceline and Disney hurt consumer-focused companies, and health care stocks also stumbled as drug companies fell. Investors did not react much to President Donald Trump's surprise decision to fire FBI director James Comey on Tuesday evening. US stocks also had little reaction to the French presidential election last weekend, although European indexes climbed following the win by centrist candidate Emmanuel Macron. "It's almost as if the market has become numb," said Julian Emanuel, an equity strategist for UBS. "Investors are interpreting this as more noise." The Standard & Poor's 500 index picked up 2.71 points, or 0.1%, to 2,399.63, a fraction of a point above the all-time high it set on Monday. The Dow Jones industrial average shed 32.67 points, or 0.2%, to 20,943.11 as Disney and Boeing slumped. The Nasdaq composite finished at a record for the fourth day in a row as it rose 8.56 points, or 0.1%, to 6,129.14. The Russell 2000 index of small-company stocks was up 7.73 points, or 0.6%, to 1,399.59. Oil prices made big gains as reports showed US crude stockpiles dropped by 5.2 million barrels last week. That was bigger than analysts expected. Crude inventories are returning to more normal levels after they swelled to record highs the last few years. Benchmark US crude surged 3.2%, to $47.33 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, the international standard, gained 3.1%, to $50.22 a barrel in London.

International Business Times UK UK World Business Politics Fintech Technology Science Sport Entertainment Opinion Video Pictures Log out Newsletter Signup Economy Companies Markets Finance Regulation Business Markets Little movement in US markets amidst political turmoil Snapchat parent company stocks plummet after it reveals $2.2bn loss. By James Tennent May 10, 2017 23:00 BST Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, on 20 April 2017REUTERS/Brendan McDermid After the sudden firing of FBI director James Comey on Tuesday night (9 May) and the subsequent, continuing political fall-out, US markets have moved little throughout Wednesday, with the Nasdaq reaching a new record high for the fourth straight day. The Dow Jones Industrial average fell 0.16%, or 32.67, points to end the day at 20,943.11; the S&P 500 rose 0.11% or 2.71 points to finish at 2,399.63; the Nasdaq rose 0.14% or 8.55 to end the day at a new record of 6,129.14. After hours, Snap Inc, the parent company of social media platform Snapchat, revealed a loss of $2.2bn (£1.7bn) for the first quarter in their first public earnings report. Snap Inc stock fell more than 20% after the market closed on Wednesday. Snap's high initial valuation was criticised by some, with many asking how the company would truly monetise. For the Dow, falling shares in Disney and Boeing contributed to the day's losses. Though there was little reaction to the political news from markets, the day did begin with an energy sector rally. On market reaction to Comey's dismissal, one chief investment strategist told MarketWatch.com that it "certainly isn't something positive" but that it was "too early to tell" whether there would be any real market movement from the incident.

Above, a sign for the Mary's Place shelter adorns a wall in the former motel in May 2016. Jason Redmond/AFP/Getty Images The idea of mixed-use development isn't new. But today Amazon announced that a new building it plans to construct in Seattle will feature a decidedly uncommon mix: its own high-tech offices, and a homeless shelter with space for 65 families. The company said it will donate more than 47,000 square feet of space, or about half of the new six-story building, to Mary's Place, which operates several family shelters. Last year, Amazon invited Mary's Place to set up a shelter inside a former Travelodge it owns. That building will be torn down, but its replacement will include a permanent shelter space with room for about 200 homeless women, children, and families. U.S. Seattle Swings Between Hounding The Homeless And Leaving Them Alone Homelessness is a huge problem in Seattle, where tent cities have sprung up under the interstates. King County and Seattle had the third-largest population of homeless people last year. A report from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development counted 10,730 homeless people in Seattle and King County in 2016. Washington state had the second-highest total increase in homeless people (1,408) between 2015 and 2016, according to the report. Seattle's leaders declared a homelessness state of emergency in 2015. The Seattle Times reported that the city's mayor called homelessness a human tragedy "seldom seen in the history of our city." And many point to companies like Amazon for exacerbating the problem: The company is hiring thousands of people, and its high-paid employees drive up housing prices. Census data released in September showed that median incomes jumped $10,000 in a single year. Over the years, Amazon has been criticized for trailing the city's other major companies philanthropically. In 2012, The Seattle Times did the numbers on corporate giving to United Way of King County. "Microsoft made a corporate donation of $4 million," it reported. "Boeing gave $3.1 million. Nordstrom, nearly $320,000. And Amazon.com? Zero." Cities Project A Chicago Community Puts Mixed-Income Housing To The Test The newspaper said Amazon "cuts an astoundingly low profile in the civic life of its hometown." Building a homeless shelter within one of its new buildings appears to be an effort to change that narrative. "Doing things like [the homeless shelter] may be in its enlightened self-interest, right on site for the world to see," Alan Durning, executive director of Sightline Institute, a nonprofit public policy research organization focused on the Pacific Northwest, told The New York Times. Amazon News YouTube A video accompanying Amazon's press release struck some observers as a little too crafted. Tech site VentureBeat called it "heartbreaking... and weird:" "[T]he company chose to surprise [Mary's Place executive director Marty] Hartman in a highly staged setting, surrounded by camera equipment and a microphone designed to capture the emotional moment and then package it later as part of the press release. ... What makes it uncomfortable for me is the Oprah-like surprise that seems obviously designed to create a viral video moment." All Tech Considered As Amazon Moves In, A Local Bookseller Hopes To Thrive With A Personal Touch Amazon's announcement comes just two weeks after Seattle's mayor trumpeted that Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen's foundation was promising $30 million toward building a new facility to house the city's homeless families and children. The city of Seattle committed an additional $5 million in capital and funds to support the center's operations and maintenance. Amazon's less-traditional approach will house some of the city's homeless families under the same roof as tech workers who are driving the city's ever-more expensive housing market. The company says its employees are "frequent visitors and volunteers" at the existing shelter. By sharing a space, Amazon says, its employees will have more opportunities to volunteer and support Mary's Place. mixed-use development Seattle Amazon homelessness Facebook Twitter Google+ Email The Two-Way Breaking News From NPR The Two-Way Breaking News From NPR About The Two-Way is the place to come for breaking news, analysis and for stories that are just too interesting – or too entertaining – to pass up.

Technology companies also rose. The meager gains Wednesday were enough to mark new all-time highs for the Standard & Poor's 500 index and the Nasdaq composite. The Dow Jones industrial average was dragged down by drops in Disney and Boeing. Among gaining stocks, Chesapeake Energy jumped 6.5%. Chipmaker Nvidia soared 18% after reporting earnings that were higher than analysts were expecting. The S&P 500 index rose 2 points, or 0.1%, to 2,399, a fraction of a point above its most recent record. The Dow lost 32 points, or 0.2%, to 20,943. The Nasdaq composite rose 8 points, or 0.1%, to 6,129, its fourth record close in a row.   My Take on This Story Report a story error Show results without voting  |   0% Hilarious 25% Intriguing 25% Depressing 38% Brilliant 0% Scary 13% Ridiculous Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Email Story 4 comments Copyright 2017 Newser, LLC.

Another UP day for me in my STOCK PORTFOLIO being in GREAT SHAPE! Thanks again PREZ TRUMP! Have a nice day & There ya go ALL! PREZ TRUMP for 8 Years Followed by PREZ Pence for 8 years from 2024 till 2032 &. The GOP in CHARGE of the HOUSE ,SENATE ,SCOTUS & THE WH for many YEARS after that!<-I LOVE that sound very much NOW! AnnaPelosi May 10, 2017 4:08 PM CDT The two sides of the news are interesting. The "where's the volatility" camp is making it out that the low volatility is a mark against Trump. Meanwhile the markets steadily hit new highs - without all the volatility most of us hate. Volatility is created by two strong sets of opposing visions for the market - those who think, strongly, the market will go up, and those who think, strongly, the market will go down. If you only have one side, it takes out the energy that makes for volatility. For sure there are those who think Trump's policies are bad, but not enough to turn into shorts. So we've got a long-only market, with about half the people betting it will go up, and half the people without the political desire to invest, but without enough conviction to actually sell off or go short. Interestingly I think POLITICS is making this a mild, slowly rising market - which is fine with me.

Anthony Lai/Daily Nexus This will be the fourth time Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP) has introduced such a resolution. The most recent attempt occurred in 2015, when the bill failed to pass with then-Internal Vice President Angela Lau casting the tie-breaking “no” vote. Senators Jonathan Lopez and Unique Vance will first introduce the resolution; afterward, student sponsors Anumita Kaur and Edan Tessema will have a chance to speak. The public will then be able to discuss their own opinions on the resolution. Aaron Jones, the A.S. assistant director for community affairs, student engagement and advocacy, said these hearings have been widely attended by students in the past. “Even for a spectator observing the dynamics of the room itself, [it’s] very polarizing. One half of the room has one particular position, the other half of the room has an opposing position,” Jones said. “These meetings are well attended such that they often have to be moved to Corwin Pavilion to accommodate the hundreds of people that show up.” Student group Students for Justice in Palestine first released the resolution to the public on April 24. Since then, the resolution has been endorsed by 36 student organizations on campus including the Student Activist Network. If passed, the resolution will prompt A.S. to divest from companies such as Boeing, Raytheon, Northrop Grumman, Caterpillar and Hewlett Packard. According to the bill, these corporations have provided Israel with military aid in attacks on Gaza. SJP acknowledged that A.S. UCSB does not hold any investments in these companies, but they hope the bill will spur A.S. to take an active role in advocating for the UC to divest. On Monday, eight Jewish student organizations published a joint statement opposing the resolution. “We feel for the Palestinians and Israelis, and we work actively to promote speakers and projects that help bring both sides together toward a peaceful solution,” the statement read. “We, the Jewish student leaders of UCSB, are united in rejecting this one sided, counterproductive, and incredibly hurtful BDS [Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions] resolution.” Members of both sides hope students come out for the meeting. Kaur, a fourth-year sociology major, said attending the meeting is relevant for UC Santa Barbara students. “Folks don’t have to make a statement; folks don’t have to stay the whole time, but coming out is important,” she said. “This is the money of every single student on this campus, and so this pertains to every single student on this campus.” Talia Karu, a third-year biopsychology major and the president of the student board at Santa Barbara Hillel, is planning to attend the meeting in opposition to the resolution. She said she hopes that students who attend the meeting will try to understand both perspectives of the topic. “Anything you’re going to hear about this issue is going to be biased, one side or another,” she said. “If you do go, try and take everything with a grain of salt, and try to understand that it’s a very personal issue … [It’s important] to keep that in mind and to respect both sides of the matter.” Print Share this: Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window) Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window) Related <a href="http://oncampusweb-d.openx.net/w/1.0/rc?cs=d620d4ba43&amp;cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE"><img src="http://oncampusweb-d.openx.net/w/1.0/ai?auid=536875323&amp;cs=d620d4ba43&amp;cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE" border="0" alt=""></a> <a href="http://oncampusweb-d.openx.net/w/1.0/rc?cs=8b66e5310d&amp;cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE"><img src="http://oncampusweb-d.openx.net/w/1.0/ai?auid=536875323&amp;cs=8b66e5310d&amp;cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE" border="0" alt=""></a> Leave a Reply Be the First to Comment!

Above, a sign for the Mary's Place shelter adorns a wall in the former motel in May 2016. Jason Redmond/AFP/Getty Images The idea of mixed-use development isn't new. But today Amazon announced that a new building it plans to construct in Seattle will feature a decidedly uncommon mix: its own high-tech offices, and a homeless shelter with space for 65 families. The company said it will donate more than 47,000 square feet of space, or about half of the new six-story building, to Mary's Place, which operates several family shelters. Last year, Amazon invited Mary's Place to set up a shelter inside a former Travelodge it owns. That building will be torn down, but its replacement will include a permanent shelter space with room for about 200 homeless women, children, and families. U.S. Seattle Swings Between Hounding The Homeless And Leaving Them Alone Homelessness is a huge problem in Seattle, where tent cities have sprung up under the interstates. King County and Seattle had the third-largest population of homeless people last year. A report from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development counted 10,730 homeless people in Seattle and King County in 2016. Washington state had the second-highest total increase in homeless people (1,408) between 2015 and 2016, according to the report. Seattle's leaders declared a homelessness state of emergency in 2015. The Seattle Times reported that the city's mayor called homelessness a human tragedy "seldom seen in the history of our city." And many point to companies like Amazon for exacerbating the problem: The company is hiring thousands of people, and its high-paid employees drive up housing prices. Census data released in September showed that median incomes jumped $10,000 in a single year. Over the years, Amazon has been criticized for trailing the city's other major companies philanthropically. In 2012, The Seattle Times did the numbers on corporate giving to United Way of King County. "Microsoft made a corporate donation of $4 million," it reported. "Boeing gave $3.1 million. Nordstrom, nearly $320,000. And Amazon.com? Zero." Cities Project A Chicago Community Puts Mixed-Income Housing To The Test The newspaper said Amazon "cuts an astoundingly low profile in the civic life of its hometown." Building a homeless shelter within one of its new buildings appears to be an effort to change that narrative. "Doing things like [the homeless shelter] may be in its enlightened self-interest, right on site for the world to see," Alan Durning, executive director of Sightline Institute, a nonprofit public policy research organization focused on the Pacific Northwest, told The New York Times. Amazon News YouTube A video accompanying Amazon's press release struck some observers as a little too crafted. Tech site VentureBeat called it "heartbreaking... and weird:" "[T]he company chose to surprise [Mary's Place executive director Marty] Hartman in a highly staged setting, surrounded by camera equipment and a microphone designed to capture the emotional moment and then package it later as part of the press release. ... What makes it uncomfortable for me is the Oprah-like surprise that seems obviously designed to create a viral video moment." All Tech Considered As Amazon Moves In, A Local Bookseller Hopes To Thrive With A Personal Touch Amazon's announcement comes just two weeks after Seattle's mayor trumpeted that Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen's foundation was promising $30 million toward building a new facility to house the city's homeless families and children. The city of Seattle committed an additional $5 million in capital and funds to support the center's operations and maintenance. Amazon's less-traditional approach will house some of the city's homeless families under the same roof as tech workers who are driving the city's ever-more expensive housing market. The company says its employees are "frequent visitors and volunteers" at the existing shelter. By sharing a space, Amazon says, its employees will have more opportunities to volunteer and support Mary's Place. mixed-use development Seattle Amazon homelessness Facebook Twitter Google+ Email The Two-Way Breaking News From NPR The Two-Way Breaking News From NPR About The Two-Way is the place to come for breaking news, analysis and for stories that are just too interesting – or too entertaining – to pass up.

The space agency and prime contractor Boeing have set up independent review teams to find out what happened. (NASA photo) Print Email Lee Roop | lroop@al.com By Lee Roop | lroop@al.com The Huntsville Times Email the author | Follow on Twitter on May 10, 2017 at 3:06 PM, updated May 10, 2017 at 3:09 PM comments A piece of test hardware for NASA's Space Launch System was damaged May 3 at the Michoud Assembly Facility outside New Orleans, the space agency said today confirming Internet reports. The hardware damaged was the aft or bottom dome of a test Liquid Oxygen Tank, Marshall Space Flight Center spokeswoman Kim Henry said Wednesday. "There was some damage to it," Henry said, but it was not welded to the rest of the tank when the accident happened. A report on the website NASA Watch today said the dome was "dropped and is damaged beyond repair. The accident also damaged some tooling."  NASA has not yet announced the extent of damage and is not saying exactly what happened, Henry said, because the space agency is still "working to put together the facts." NASA and prime contractor Boeing have both formed independent assessment teams, Henry said. The effect on the SLS development calendar is also unclear. There were no injuries, and the incident happened during "normal operations," she said. The dome was not in NASA's vertical assembly tool at the time, and that tool was not damaged. The Space Launch System will lift off the pad powered by two solid rocket boosters and main engines fed by liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen. The liquid oxygen tank is the smaller of the two liquid fuel tanks. Best restaurant in each Alabama county ...

The hotel would be torn down and the shelter kicked out when that time came.   Instead, Amazon has decided to let the shelter stay. In an unusual arrangement, the company has agreed to give the shelter, Mary’s Place, a permanent home inside one of the new office buildings for which it will break ground in the fall.   Amazon will give roughly half of the six-story building to the shelter, providing it with 47,000 square feet of space with private rooms that can hold 65 families, or about 220 people and their pets. The facility, expected to open in early 2020, will have its own entrance and elevators.   “I see it as this huge gift because everywhere we go, we end up leaving,” said Marty Hartman, the executive director of Mary’s Place, which runs seven transitional shelters around the Seattle area meant to house families until they can find permanent homes. “You come in and become a fabric of the neighborhood you’re in, and then you say goodbye. That’s a hard thing for a lot of people to do.”   In an interview at the current Mary’s Place site owned by Amazon, which was bustling with families returning to the shelter for the evening, John Schoettler, Amazon’s vice president for global real estate and facilities, said the company would spend “tens of millions of dollars” on the design and construction of the shelter’s portion of the building. Amazon will pay the utilities for Mary’s Place, which will occupy the space rent free, although the organization will continue to pay its own staff.   Schoettler said Amazon originally allowed the shelter to stay in the motel because of the severity of Seattle’s homelessness crisis, which had prompted the city’s mayor to declare a state of emergency in 2015. Schoettler said Amazon was impressed by Mary’s Place, and he described its plan to give the shelter a permanent home as an investment in the neighborhood.   In San Francisco, Google, Salesforce.com and others have funded a campaign to find permanent housing for homeless people. But Nan Roman, president of the National Alliance to End Homelessness, a nonprofit advocacy group in Washington, DC, said she was unaware of any other private corporation integrating a homeless shelter into its building. “Too often, homelessness gets pushed to the other side of the tracks,” Roman said. “Keeping them as neighbors is nice.”   In Seattle, the plan could also help burnish Amazon’s image, which has taken some hits. It has been targeted by anti-gentrification activists, and its high-pressure work culture was the subject of a New York Times investigation two years ago.   Amazon has also been bashed for being disengaged from civic life relative to local stalwarts known for their philanthropic giving, like Boeing, Microsoft and Starbucks. More recently, that has begun to change, with gifts like Amazon’s $10 million donation for the construction of a new computer science building at the University of Washington.   “Its reputation in Seattle has certainly suffered,” said Alan Durning, executive director of Sightline Institute, a nonprofit research organization focused on the Pacific Northwest. “Doing things like this may be in its enlightened self-interest, right on site for the world to see.”   Amazon is also a different company from just a few years ago. It now has 30,000 employees in the city, making it Seattle’s largest private employer, and it has transformed large swaths of the downtown and South Lake Union neighborhoods.   While the company not long ago consistently lost money, Amazon now regularly turns a profit thanks to its lucrative cloud-computing business, giving it more financial breathing room for activities like philanthropy.   Seattle’s homelessness crisis has also worsened, with tent encampments sprouting up by the side of freeways, under bridges and in parks. The surrounding King County area had the third-largest homeless population in the country last year, after New York and Los Angeles, according to an annual report to Congress by the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development.   More than 10,000 people are homeless in the area, with more than 4,000 of them living on the streets, the Seattle/King County Coalition on Homelessness estimated in a report last year.   One of the residents of Mary’s Place, Patricia Abbott, a mother of four, said she became homeless after losing her job when her son was injured and she needed to tend to his medical needs. She has been at the facility for six months and learned of Amazon’s support for the organization at the shelter’s Christmas party when she received an American Girl doll for one of her children from the company.   “There’s people out there who really do care,” Abbott said.   Schoettler said he proposed the plan to let the shelter remain at a meeting in January of Amazon’s senior leadership, including Jeff Bezos, the company’s chief executive. Schoettler made the invitation to Hartman of Mary’s Place last week, she said in an interview on Monday. “It’s permanent,” Schoettler said, pausing for a moment before adding, “Until homelessness is solved.”   ©2017 The New York Times News Service Read More On Amazon | Marty Hartman | John Schoettler | Seattle | International | Companies PREVIOUS STORY NEXT STORY RECOMMENDED FOR YOU Advertisements Cover from Natural Calamities.

Take your FirstStep Amazon to share new building with homeless shelter in Seattle Amazon will give roughly half of the six-story building to the shelter Amazon will give roughly half of the six-story building to the shelter A year ago, when Amazon let a homeless shelter for families move into a former motel it owned, it was viewed as a nice but fleeting gesture.   The motel was on a chunk of downtown property where Amazon planned to eventually erect yet another set of sparkling buildings to meet its insatiable need for office space in this city, where it has come to embody both the region’s economic boom and its struggles with affordability. The hotel would be torn down and the shelter kicked out when that time came.   Instead, Amazon has decided to let the shelter stay. In an unusual arrangement, the company has agreed to give the shelter, Mary’s Place, a permanent home inside one of the new office buildings for which it will break ground in the fall.   Amazon will give roughly half of the six-story building to the shelter, providing it with 47,000 square feet of space with private rooms that can hold 65 families, or about 220 people and their pets. The facility, expected to open in early 2020, will have its own entrance and elevators.   “I see it as this huge gift because everywhere we go, we end up leaving,” said Marty Hartman, the executive director of Mary’s Place, which runs seven transitional shelters around the Seattle area meant to house families until they can find permanent homes. “You come in and become a fabric of the neighborhood you’re in, and then you say goodbye. That’s a hard thing for a lot of people to do.”   In an interview at the current Mary’s Place site owned by Amazon, which was bustling with families returning to the shelter for the evening, John Schoettler, Amazon’s vice president for global real estate and facilities, said the company would spend “tens of millions of dollars” on the design and construction of the shelter’s portion of the building. Amazon will pay the utilities for Mary’s Place, which will occupy the space rent free, although the organization will continue to pay its own staff.   Schoettler said Amazon originally allowed the shelter to stay in the motel because of the severity of Seattle’s homelessness crisis, which had prompted the city’s mayor to declare a state of emergency in 2015. Schoettler said Amazon was impressed by Mary’s Place, and he described its plan to give the shelter a permanent home as an investment in the neighborhood.   In San Francisco, Google, Salesforce.com and others have funded a campaign to find permanent housing for homeless people. But Nan Roman, president of the National Alliance to End Homelessness, a nonprofit advocacy group in Washington, DC, said she was unaware of any other private corporation integrating a homeless shelter into its building. “Too often, homelessness gets pushed to the other side of the tracks,” Roman said. “Keeping them as neighbors is nice.”   In Seattle, the plan could also help burnish Amazon’s image, which has taken some hits. It has been targeted by anti-gentrification activists, and its high-pressure work culture was the subject of a New York Times investigation two years ago.   Amazon has also been bashed for being disengaged from civic life relative to local stalwarts known for their philanthropic giving, like Boeing, Microsoft and Starbucks. More recently, that has begun to change, with gifts like Amazon’s $10 million donation for the construction of a new computer science building at the University of Washington.   “Its reputation in Seattle has certainly suffered,” said Alan Durning, executive director of Sightline Institute, a nonprofit research organization focused on the Pacific Northwest. “Doing things like this may be in its enlightened self-interest, right on site for the world to see.”   Amazon is also a different company from just a few years ago. It now has 30,000 employees in the city, making it Seattle’s largest private employer, and it has transformed large swaths of the downtown and South Lake Union neighborhoods.   While the company not long ago consistently lost money, Amazon now regularly turns a profit thanks to its lucrative cloud-computing business, giving it more financial breathing room for activities like philanthropy.   Seattle’s homelessness crisis has also worsened, with tent encampments sprouting up by the side of freeways, under bridges and in parks. The surrounding King County area had the third-largest homeless population in the country last year, after New York and Los Angeles, according to an annual report to Congress by the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development.   More than 10,000 people are homeless in the area, with more than 4,000 of them living on the streets, the Seattle/King County Coalition on Homelessness estimated in a report last year.   One of the residents of Mary’s Place, Patricia Abbott, a mother of four, said she became homeless after losing her job when her son was injured and she needed to tend to his medical needs. She has been at the facility for six months and learned of Amazon’s support for the organization at the shelter’s Christmas party when she received an American Girl doll for one of her children from the company.   “There’s people out there who really do care,” Abbott said.   Schoettler said he proposed the plan to let the shelter remain at a meeting in January of Amazon’s senior leadership, including Jeff Bezos, the company’s chief executive. Schoettler made the invitation to Hartman of Mary’s Place last week, she said in an interview on Monday. “It’s permanent,” Schoettler said, pausing for a moment before adding, “Until homelessness is solved.”   ©2017 The New York Times News Service Nick Wingfield | NYT Business Standard http://bsmedia.business-standard.com/_media/bs/wap/images/bs_logo_amp.png 177 22 Amazon to share new building with homeless shelter in Seattle Amazon will give roughly half of the six-story building to the shelter A year ago, when Amazon let a homeless shelter for families move into a former motel it owned, it was viewed as a nice but fleeting gesture.   The motel was on a chunk of downtown property where Amazon planned to eventually erect yet another set of sparkling buildings to meet its insatiable need for office space in this city, where it has come to embody both the region’s economic boom and its struggles with affordability.

In the middle is Executive Chairman Pierre Beaudoin, scion of the company’s founders. An array of institutional investors is set to withhold support from Beaudoin in a Thursday proxy vote. Caisse de Depot et Placement du Quebec, the biggest outside shareholder and a crucial business partner, criticized Bombardier on Monday for a “lapse of governance” after the manufacturer raised executive compensation despite announcing plans to cut more than 14,000 jobs and relying on taxpayer support for a $6 billion jet program. Pierre Beaudoin Photographer: Victor J. Blue/Bloomberg “The big pension funds are all piling on,” Karl Moore, an associate professor at McGill University’s business school in Montreal. “That’s putting enormous pressure on the board. It speaks loudly of their desire for change.” The vote will be held as Chief Executive Officer Alain Bellemare pushes a turnaround plan at Bombardier after the C Series jetliner program championed by Beaudoin entered service more than two years late and $2 billion over budget. Beaudoin, in a nine-year tenure as either CEO or chairman, earned about $53 million, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Bombardier’s widely traded Class B shares tumbled 75 percent in the period. Quebec’s Bombardier and Beaudoin families control the company by virtue of owning a majority of the Class A multiple voting shares. Each Class A share carries 10 votes, compared with one each for the Class B stock. That’s likely to give the families the last word even if outside shareholders reject the compensation plan and withhold support from Beaudoin. “Governance and the family is what this is about,” said David Tyerman, an analyst at Cormark Securities. “A lot of public money is involved, a lot of it has been raised under challenging circumstances. Investors aren’t very happy about the dual-class structure.” On Wednesday, Canada Pension Plan Investment Board became the latest institutional investor to say it would withhold support for Beaudoin’s re-election and vote against the company’s executive-compensation package. The decision by the country’s largest pension fund manager followed the lead of investors such as the Caisse, Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan and the British Columbia Investment Management Corp. Turnaround Plan Bellemare, 55, who took over from Beaudoin as CEO in 2015, has made progress in fostering a recovery, Tyerman said. He cut costs amid sluggish sales for private jets, Bombardier’s most profitable products. The company won a lifeline for the C Series last year with orders from Delta Air Lines Inc. and Air Canada. Shares jumped 62 percent, tripling the gain in Canada’s benchmark S&P/TSX Composite Index. Bombardier will report first-quarter earnings Thursday before the annual meeting, which is scheduled to start at 10 a.m. New York time at a company facility in suburban Montreal. The company is expected to report an adjusted loss of 2 cents a share, according to the average of analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Beaudoin still plans to run for re-election to the Bombardier board at the annual meeting, spokesman Simon Letendre said Wednesday. Beaudoin, 54, took over as CEO of the company from his father Laurent in 2008. He previously ran Bombardier’s business-jet unit and won a reputation as an effective builder of international partnerships in China and elsewhere, as the company pushed its private planes, regional jets and trains. But his signature decision was to take on Boeing Co. and Airbus SE with the C Series, Bombardier’s biggest plane yet. Stretching Resources The younger Beaudoin also made Bombardier simultaneously develop two other aircraft programs, the Global 7000 and Lear 85 business jets. That stretched engineering and financial resources. Both the C Series and Global 7000 fell behind schedule, and the Lear 85 was eventually scrapped, resulting in a $1.2 billion writedown. The most important business stories of the day. Get Bloomberg's daily newsletter. Sign Up Then there was the cost of developing the C Series as a major new entrant in the global market for workhorse single-aisle aircraft. At $6 billion, the latest cost estimate of the C Series program now represents almost twice the company’s market value of about C$4.7 billion ($3.4 billion). That contributed to saddling the company with about $9 billion of debt, which led Bombardier to seek government support from both Quebec and Canada. The plane has won applause from initial operators Swiss International and AirBaltic after entering commercial service last year. But with the exception of a two-aircraft order from Air Tanzania in December, Bombardier hasn’t booked a major sale of C Series jets since Delta committed to buying at least 75 planes in April 2016. “They need to firm up the order book soon,” said John Stephenson, CEO of Toronto-based money manager Stephenson & Co., who which sold its Bombardier shares earlier this year. “They made a very large bet, built a great plane but risked the company on it. The jury is still out.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

X Amazon to include homeless shelter in new development Downtown Seattle project to provide rooms for 220 homeless people about 14 hours ago The former motel in Seattle where Amazon has allowed homeless to remain         A year ago, when Amazon allowed a homeless shelter for families move into a former motel it owned, it was viewed as a nice but fleeting gesture. The motel was on a chunk of downtown property in Seattle where Amazon planned to eventually erect yet another set of sparkling buildings to meet its insatiable need for office space in this city, where it has come to embody both the region’s economic boom and its struggles with affordability. The hotel would be torn down and the shelter kicked out when that time came. Instead, Amazon has decided to let the shelter stay. In an unusual arrangement the company has agreed to give the shelter, Mary’s Place, a permanent home inside one of the new office buildings for which it will break ground in the autumn. Amazon will give roughly half of the six-storey building to the shelter, providing it with 47,000sq ft of space, with private rooms that can hold 65 families, or about 220 people and their pets. The facility, expected to open in early 2020, will have its own entrance and elevators. “I see it as this huge gift because everywhere we go, we end up leaving,” said Marty Hartman, the executive director of Mary’s Place, which runs seven transitional shelters around the Seattle area meant to house families until they can find permanent homes. “You come in and become a fabric of the neighbourhood you’re in, and then you say goodbye.

Booster Fuels is a growing startup in the Bay Area that fuels cars at office parks and corporate campuses during customers’ work shifts, eliminating their need to go to the gas station. By Annie Sciacca | asciacca@bayareanewsgroup.com | Bay Area News Group PUBLISHED: May 10, 2017 at 8:00 am | UPDATED: May 10, 2017 at 2:55 pm Many Bay Area companies strive to offer a slew of perks to attract and retain employees. On-site childcare, company cafeterias and in-office bars are among the popular ones. Here’s another one for those who hate the chore of going to the gas station: fueling employees’ cars at their office parking lots while they work. That is what Burlingame-based startup Booster Fuels is offering for companies and office parks. The “mobile gas station” is the latest trend in on-demand services popping up to serve those on a quest for convenience. And it’s growing its presence in the Bay Area, adding almost 30 companies or campuses each month. Founder and CEO Frank Mycroft attributes that growth to the company’s promise of convenience and the fact that the gas it provides tends to be about 10 to 15 cents cheaper than what’s available at local gas stations. “For us, it’s all about efficiency,” Mycroft said. Companies and office parks or campuses sign up with Booster Fuels to provide employees with the service — some companies pay for the gas, too, while others simply sign up to offer the access. Employees can then place an order for their car to be filled up while they’re at work, Monday through Friday (those with cars that have locked gas caps will have to pop the cap on the day they order fuel). Manasvi Shah, who works at a company called Insurity in an office in San Ramon’s Bishop Ranch business park, signed up for the service as soon as it became available there a few months ago. “I haven’t gone to the gas station since,” Shah said. She likes that you can order the fuel service that day, and once she hits the order button on the app, she does not have to think about it. “I don’t have anything against going to the gas station, but it always seems like the light comes on when you’re rushing on a Monday morning,” she said, adding that “California gas stations tend to have a long queue,” particularly at cheaper gas stations like those found at Costco. Todd Harris, president and CEO of credit union Tech CU, said in a recent Booster Fuels news release that the gas delivery is one of the most popular perks the company has offered, with about 40 percent of his employees using it. Mycroft, Booster Fuels’ founder, said the idea for the company came to him when his wife was pregnant, and they felt nervous about crime at the gas station near their home. “I thought, ‘Why are we doing this? No one likes going to the gas station — there has to be a better way’,” said Mycroft, who is a former engineer for NASA and Boeing. He started the company in Texas and soon expanded it to the Bay Area, where it is now headquartered. Mycroft said the reason it can keep its gas cheaper than at gas stations is that it cuts out the transport companies and underground tanks that gas stations use, instead getting gas directly from refineries and bringing it (via its bright purple trucks) directly to customers.The company has now pumped more than 3 million gallons of gas for employees at companies including Cisco, Oracle, eBay, Gilead, McKesson, PepsiCo and over 250 other companies and office centers. Unlike the plethora of Bay Area startups that focus on city living, this one is geared toward the suburbs, where plenty of people are driving to big work campuses and business parks. It’s possible that Booster Fuels will soon expand its services beyond workplaces, but it could run into problems. Some fire departments are cracking down on mobile gas-delivery services, according to a report from Bloomberg. That includes San Francisco, which cited concerns to Bloomberg about the danger of having fuel trucks driving around the city. The report also said the city of Santa Clara is reviewing its rules on the topic. Booster Fuels said it has to get a permit for each city in which it operates. Still, Mycroft said he sees big potential in the space. “We think this is a model that can grow to any commercial location — places like Park n’ Rides or retail malls,” Mycroft said. “In that way, we can start to open it up to more and more people.” Get top headlines in your inbox every afternoon.

News Opinion Commentary Commentary: No, James Comey's firing isn't like the 'Saturday Night Massacre' President Donald Trump fired FBI Director James Comey May 9. (Sign up for our free video newsletter) President Donald Trump fired FBI Director James Comey May 9. (Sign up for our free video newsletter) Hugh HewittSpecial to the Washington Post Long ago and far away, when I was a young special assistant first to Attorney General William French Smith and then to Attorney General Edwin Meese, the young staff would automatically stand up whenever William Webster, then head of the FBI, walked into a room. At Friday morning round-table briefings in the attorney general's massive conference room, when Webster spoke, everyone leaned in. He had the bearing, the competence and the character of the nation's top and trusted cop. Last summer an old D.C. hand took me to one of those Beltway places of lore for lunch and a cigar and talked candidly about how shocked he was at then-FBI Director James B. Comey's decision to publicly discuss the Hillary Clinton email investigation and to walk the public through a hundred details of the case and then conclude she should not be prosecuted. Agree or disagree with that decision, he said, it's not what the FBI does. Ever. Agents present facts to prosecutors. They may nudge or even push in one direction or the other, but they don't decide. My interlocutor, a former assistant U.S. attorney and then-senior official in numerous positions and companies, was not so much outraged by Comey's actions at the time as puzzled, perhaps even shocked. Apparently, new Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein shared exactly that view and expressed it succinctly in his three-page memo to Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Confidence in the FBI would not come back until a new director was in place, and that, of course, requires that Comey be fired. Not a decision to be taken lightly, Rosenstein argued, but one he recommended that Sessions make. Sessions reviewed the recommendation, concurred and forwarded a joint recommendation to the president, who agreed. Anyone who thinks this is connected to a cover-up of "Russian collusion" has to believe that both Rosenstein and Sessions would participate in such a corrupt scheme. I don't. It is, in fact, absurd to think that. Reread the Rosenstein memo — a few times. There's the story. Comey was wrong in July, wrong in subsequent statements, wrong as recently as last week and refused to admit error. The story is a straight-line one, and it's about Rosenstein. Read the story In fact, just last week Comey said this in response to a question from Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., about whether Rosenstein should appoint a special prosecutor in the Russian investigations: "That's a judgment he'll have to make. He is, as I hoped I was as deputy attorney general, a very independent-minded, career-oriented person, but it'd be premature for me to comment on that." That's Comey on Rosenstein. Last week. Under oath. Which doesn't mean that questions about the investigation of Russia's attack on our election are any less serious or the need for a thorough inquiry into charges of collusion between Russia and anyone in the many circles of President Donald Trump is any less pressing. It just means that the FBI has to be led by someone like Webster to assure that both sides of deeply divided D.C. accept the results of all facets of the investigation. Moreover, at last week's hearing Comey told Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., that there are 2,000 investigations into would-be "violent extremists" — half home-grown and in the "lone wolf" category, the other half in contact with foreign organizations (of whom about 300 are immigrants to the United States). That's a massive threat. The FBI is the chief bulwark against it as well as against all cybercrime from abroad (government-sponsored and private criminal activity) and organized crime at home. The director simply cannot lack the confidence of the deputy attorney general or the attorney general. So whom to turn to? Most definitely someone in the Webster mold, which means a current or former federal judge of stellar reputation for both character and competence, and perhaps with some charisma that could prove useful in rallying the FBI and the Justice Department. Someone like J. Michael Luttig, former 4th Circuit judge and now-general counsel for Boeing; U.S. District Judge Richard J. Leon, who has handled scores of terrorism cases; or Stephen Larson, one of my law partners, a former federal judge and formerhead of the organized-crime division of the U.S. Attorney's Office for California's Central District. There are, in fact, plenty of superb candidates in the mold of these three that must bring stature and independence to the job. But first we have to endure a few days of over-the-top takes from the always overwrought mainstream media. This isn't the "Saturday Night Massacre." There are no tapes, no subpoenas for presidential documents, no resignations from the Justice Department, but instead recommendations from the Justice Department. It's four months into an administration, not four years. In short, the overwrought media has toppled into hysteria again.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 10 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Small-Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (SUAV) Market: Global Industry Analysis and Forecast to 2015 to 2021 New York, NY — (SBWIRE) — 05/10/2017 — Small-unmanned aerial vehicle is a small aircraft, which fly without direct human contact and is controlled by the remote control. The need for gathering information from the air in case of natural disasters and accidents has increased in recent years. Small-unmanned aerial vehicles have been attracting a great deal of attention as a safe and efficient means of acquiring such information. Due to its various features, such as easy to operate, easy to transport, high endurance, low life cycle cost, long picture taking range, high quality image and video, real time data transfer and capable to perform in all weather conditions, the demand of small-unmanned aerial vehicle is growing. Various types of small-unmanned aerial vehicle are light fixed-wing SUAV, heavy fixed-wing SUAV, multi-rotor VTOL SUAV and nano SUAV. These small-unmanned aerial vehicles plays an important role in many armed forces and civilian missions including border surveillance, military attacks, weather determination, mapping, surveying, and regional law enforcements. A sample of this report is available upon request @ http://www.persistencemarketresearch.com/samples/3512 Small-unmanned aerial vehicle also plays an important role in agriculture industry. Large-scale farmer use small-unmanned aerial vehicle to view their crop growth from remote distance. Commercial use of small-unmanned aerial vehicles is expected to be an emerging line of business worth billions of dollars within a few years. Industrial application of small-unmanned aerial vehicle includes retail, media and entertainment, energy, mining and metals. The market for small-unmanned aerial vehicle is restrained by regulation on unmanned operations in civilian airspace but impending regulatory changes are expected to unlock the huge potential of this technology. Small-unmanned aerial vehicles are used in search and rescue operation. By use of small-unmanned aerial vehicle the cost of sending a group of people in dangerous place get reduced. It would be easy to use small-unmanned aerial vehicle to look out for the people and take an overview of the situation in easy manner. In construction industry, small-unmanned aerial vehicles are used for inspection of building and bridge and thus reduce the human cost and efforts. The growing terrorism attacks need higher security requirements make small-unmanned aerial vehicle as the best alternative to use. This leads to drive the demand of small-unmanned aerial vehicle market, specifically in Asia Pacific and Middle East regions, which suffer terrorist attacks on a regular basis. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) estimates that more than 7,500 small-unmanned aerial vehicle would be flying in the national airspace in the next five years. Company such as Amazon.com, Inc. is planning to use small-unmanned aerial vehicle for commercial purpose for product delivering through air. Their approval for use of small-unmanned aerial vehicle in commercial purpose is inroad with Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). Once approved, this is further expected to drive the demand of small-unmanned aerial vehicle market in North America and Europe.

Lt. Gen. Arnold Bunch, military deputy to the Air Force’s assistant secretary for acquisition, told Defense One the branch looks to transfer 10 EC-130H electronic packages to new aircraft that could provide higher flight capacity. BAE Systems built the aircraft’s prime mission equipment while L3 served as the aircraft integration and depot maintenance provider, according to the Air Force website. Defense One reported L3 will transfer and reinstall the EC-130H electronics into 10 new commercial aircraft as lead systems integrator of the replacement program. Acting Air Force Secretary Lisa Disbrow has said she believes that a lead systems integrator approach is an “efficient, expedient and cost-effective” way to re-host the Compass Call technology onto non-developmental commercial aircraft. Boeing, Gulfstream Aerospace and Bombardier are the companies expected to bid on the EC-130H replacement program, the report stated. Emily Grabowski, an Air Force spokeswoman, estimates the program will cost $2 billion over 10 years.

This is a record number of scholarships for Skagit students from WSOS, which was created in 2011. Overall, WSOS announced a total of 1,850 students across the state will receive a maximum of $22,500 towards their in-state bachelor’s degree. „This is a fantastic opportunity for our Skagit students,” said Michelle Judson, Skagit STEM Network Director. „The scholarships will enable our students to earn high-demand degrees, providing them with the technical and critical skills needed to thrive in today’s jobs and excel in the unknown jobs of tomorrow.” Judson said students from Anacortes, Burlington-Edison, La Conner, Mount Vernon, Sedro-Woolley, and Skagit Adventist high schools were selected to join the program. The Skagit STEM Network received a grant last Fall to actively promote the WSOS to school counselors, educators, and parents. The grant covered training about the scholarship program and resources to encourage students to apply. „Awesome results followed,” she said. „These students represent the future of our state,” said Naria Santa Lucia, executive director for WSOS. „We are delighted to welcome them to the program and help support their success over the coming years.” This year, WSOS received more than 4,000 applications-with more diversity than last year’s submitted applications. Washington STEM, which is the administrator and community partner to WSOS, supported the statewide effort to reach all eligible students. Newly selected scholars come from every legislative district in the state. Fifty seven percent are female, 64 percent identify as students of color, and 69 percent are the first in their family to attend college. All are pursuing bachelor’s degrees in approved majors in the STEM (science, technology, engineering, math) and health care fields – areas where Washington companies remain critically short on talent. WSOS was created in 2011 to address both rising tuition costs and a lack of local STEM talent prepared for industry demands. Per the legislation that governs the program, the State matches private dollars raised by WSOS, including founding partners Microsoft and Boeing. To date, the program has raised nearly $98 million from the private sector. More than 8,600 students have received support from WSOS and more than 2,400 have graduated since the program began. Eighty-three percent of graduates are employed or seeking an advanced degree in their field. More than 90 percent took jobs here in Washington. About the Washington State Opportunity Scholarship The Washington State Opportunity Scholarship was created by the Washington State Legislature in 2011 to help local students from low- and middle-income families earn high-demand degrees and launch their careers in Washington.

By Corinne Reichert | May 10, 2017 -- 03:32 GMT (20:32 PDT) | Topic: Mobility The Local Government Association of Queensland (LGAQ) has announced a live trial of drone technology to be used for disaster management, utilising Telstra's 4G network and a combination of three drone operators and four software platforms for the tests. The combination of drone operators and software platforms will allow the drones to fly beyond visual line of sight (BVLOS); however, current legislation still requires drones to be flown within line of site. Latest Australian news Roadshow targeting additional websites in piracy case Telstra 4G used in disaster management drone trial Lawyers and insurers set for data breach payday TSS visa levy to finance AU$1.5b 'Skilling Australians Fund' Crackdown on multinational tax 'black economy' Extending the reach of drones will allow their use by local councils and governments during natural disasters, according to the LGAQ, with the association hoping for regulations to be changed if the trials prove to be successful and safe. "We're only just starting to see a fraction of the potential of drone use by councils, particularly when it comes to community and worker safety in disaster management situations," said Clinton Parker, director of business solutions for LGAQ subsidiary Local Government Infrastructure Services. "This trial will give us a greater understanding of operations with the different software, how we can take advantage of Telstra's LTE network and inform how we may be able to work with all parties, including regulators, to make BVLOS a safe option." The trial will take place in the Royal Australian Air Force's Amberley Base airspace, with the second stage of the trial aiming to equip emergency management operations with drones ready for BVLOS during disasters, the LGAQ said. The drones would be used for surveying disaster zones in real time, undertaking terrain and bridge surveys post-disaster, and dropping medical supplies to citizens stuck in a disaster zone, for instance. Referring to previous trials of drone technology, Parker added that "the full potential of drones is not in dropping books or pizzas to households, but in helping protect human life and property during a disaster". The Queensland government had in July announced that it would be investing AU$1 million in drone technology to be used in the search and rescue, environmental management, agriculture, mining, energy, and telecommunications industries with the hopes of creating 500 new jobs and making these areas more efficient. "The project aims to capitalise on the capabilities inherent in drones to carry out remote-monitoring and inspection of key infrastructure and data analysis to allow for better decision making," Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk said last year. The state government also partnered with Boeing, Telstra, and Shell to further drone research at the time. Queensland MP Scott Stewart in November said he also wanted to extend the use of drones for fighting crime by Queensland Police Force. Drones could be launched from police vehicles within seconds, and at a far lower cost than helicopters. Also exploring the use of drones for natural disasters is the Austrian Red Cross, which said in March it would start launching the devices from Land Rover vehicles in the cases of avalanches, landslides, earthquakes, and floods. The Austrian Red Cross' new system, called Project Hero, will allow first responders to drive the Land Rovers close to the disaster zone and launch a drone via a tablet app to get a live aerial snapshot in order to assess the scene and form an action plan. Drones will be able to land back on a vehicle's roof even while the vehicle is moving by using magnetic retention and self-centering technology, the Austrian Red Cross said. Jaguar Land Rover Special Vehicle Operations (SVO) had designed the roof-mounted drone system as part of a 64-year partnership with the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC). The drone makes use of multiple frequency radio equipment in order to send data back to the vehicles even while there is no mobile coverage, and is equipped with clips to mount rescue equipment. AT&T in February also tested the use of drones to provide additional 4G coverage during natural disasters via flying cells. Each drone should be able to provide 4G coverage to an area of 40 square miles, according to AT&T. Likewise, UK company Windhorse Aerospace has been developing lightweight and edible food drones to bring supplies to hard-to-reach areas in times of disaster.

At Friday morning round-table briefings in the attorney general’s massive conference room, when Webster spoke, everyone leaned in. He had the bearing, the competence and the character of the nation’s top and trusted cop. Last summer an old D.C. hand took me to one of those Beltway places of lore for lunch and a cigar and talked candidly about how shocked he was at then-FBI Director James B. Comey’s decision to publicly discuss the Hillary Clinton email investigation and to walk the public through a hundred details of the case and then conclude she should not be prosecuted. Agree or disagree with that decision, he said, it’s not what the FBI does. Ever. Agents present facts to prosecutors. They may nudge or even push in one direction or the other, but they don’t decide. My interlocutor, a former assistant U.S. attorney and then-senior official in numerous positions and companies, was not so much outraged by Comey’s actions at the time as puzzled, perhaps even shocked. Apparently, new Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein shared exactly that view and expressed it succinctly in his three-page memo to Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Confidence in the FBI would not come back until a new director was in place, and that, of course, requires that Comey be fired. Not a decision to be taken lightly, Rosenstein argued, but one he recommended that Sessions make. Sessions reviewed the recommendation, concurred and forwarded a joint recommendation to the president, who agreed. Anyone who thinks this is connected to a cover-up of “Russian collusion” has to believe that both Rosenstein and Sessions would participate in such a corrupt scheme. I don’t. It is, in fact, absurd to think that. Reread the Rosenstein memo – a few times. There’s the story. Comey was wrong in July, wrong in subsequent statements, wrong as recently as last week and refused to admit error. The story is a straight-line one, and it’s about Rosenstein. In fact, just last week Comey said this in response to a question from Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., about whether Rosenstein should appoint a special prosecutor in the Russian investigations: “That’s a judgment he’ll have to make. He is, as I hoped I was as deputy attorney general, a very independent-minded, career-oriented person, but it’d be premature for me to comment on that.” That’s Comey on Rosenstein. Last week. Under oath. Which doesn’t mean that questions about the investigation of Russia’s attack on our election are any less serious or the need for a thorough inquiry into charges of collusion between Russia and anyone in the many circles of President Trump is any less pressing. It just means that the FBI has to be led by someone like Webster to assure that both sides of deeply divided D.C. accept the results of all facets of the investigation. Moreover, at last week’s hearing Comey told Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., that there are 2,000 investigations into would-be “violent extremists” – half home-grown and in the “lone wolf” category, the other half in contact with foreign organizations (of whom about 300 are immigrants to the United States). That’s a massive threat. The FBI is the chief bulwark against it as well as against all cybercrime from abroad (government-sponsored and private criminal activity) and organized crime at home. The director simply cannot lack the confidence of the deputy attorney general or the attorney general. So whom to turn to? Most definitely someone in the Webster mold, which means a current or former federal judge of stellar reputation for both character and competence, and perhaps with some charisma that could prove useful in rallying the FBI and the Justice Department. Someone like J. Michael Luttig, former 4th Circuit judge and now-general counsel for Boeing; U.S. District Judge Richard J. Leon, who has handled scores of terrorism cases; or Stephen Larson, one of my law partners, a former federal judge and former head of the organized-crime division of the U.S. Attorney’s Office for California’s Central District. There are, in fact, plenty of superb candidates in the mold of these three that must bring stature and independence to the job. But first we have to endure a few days of over-the-top takes from the always overwrought mainstream media. This isn’t the “Saturday Night Massacre.” There are no tapes, no subpoenas for presidential documents, no resignations from the Justice Department, but instead recommendations from the Justice Department. It’s four months into an administration, not four years. In short, the overwrought media has toppled into hysteria again. © 2017, The Washington Post   1 0 TOPICS Donald Trump media SHARE Facebook Twitter Previous articleEDITORIAL – The quality of Cayman crime: (Not good enough!)

EOG Resources gained 3.2 percent, and Chevron added 1.4 percent. Advertisement The price of US crude oil jumped 3 percent as fuel stockpiles kept shrinking, and that made investors more optimistic about energy company profits. Strong earnings from video game maker Electronic Arts and chip maker Nvidia helped technology stocks move up. However, weak results from Priceline and Disney hurt consumer-focused companies, and health care stocks stumbled as drug companies fell. Investors didn’t react much to President Trump’s surprise decision to fire FBI Director James Comey. US stocks also had little reaction to the French presidential election on Sunday, although European indexes climbed following the win by centrist Emmanuel Macron.

The Dow Jones industrial average shed 0.2 percent, to 20,943.11. The Nasdaq composite finished at a record for the fourth day in a row as it rose 0.1 percent, to 6,129.14. The Russell 2000 index of small-company stocks was up 0.6 percent, to 1,399.59. Nvidia advanced 17.8 percent. Nvidia tripled in value in 2016 and had wobbled early this year. Electronic Arts, which makes games including ‘‘The Sims’’ and ‘‘Mass Effect,’’ rose 12.7 percent. Entertainment giant Walt Disney posted lower sales than expected and said profit at its cable networks declined because programming costs at ESPN remain high. Its stock fell 2.2 percent. Recently Disney stock suffered a five-day losing streak partly brought on by concerns about cable advertising revenue. Advertisement Revenue for online booking service Priceline was a bit lower than analysts expected and the company’s profit forecast for the current quarter was disappointing. That sent the stock down 4.5 percent. But Priceline has soared 44 percent over the last 12 months. Boeing lost 1.2 percent after it suspended test flights of its new 737 Max plane because of possible problems with a key engine part. The Max is designed to be a more fuel-efficient version of the 737. Yelp plunged 18.4 percent after it slashed its revenue forecast, following a disappointing first-quarter report.

The space agency has detailed plans for a space-based habitat that will be placed in lunar orbit in the coming years. Multiple trips into lunar space will be required to assemble the craft and, eventually, send astronauts up to it. The crew would then live aboard the habitat - called the Deep Space Transport - for a full year to see how humans cope with extended space travel. According to NASA, this could take place in the year 2027.

The four-stage plan to the red planet was laid out at the Humans to Mars Summit held in Washington DC yesterday. "If we could conduct a yearlong crewed mission on this Deep Space Transport in cislunar space, we believe we will know enough that we could then send this thing, crewed, on a 1,000-day mission to the Mars system and back," said Greg Williams, NASA's deputy associate administrator for policy and plans in the agency's Human Exploration and Operations Mission Directorate. Alongside the Deep Space Transport would be a Deep Space Gateway craft that would also be based near the moon. This would act as a docking station for the Deep Space Transport to collect supplies and fuel before heading out to Mars.

Using solar panels for power, the Deep Space Gateway would: "support critical research and help open opportunities for global government or commercial partnerships in deep space, including lunar missions."

By Hugh Hewitt Special to The Washington Post First Published May 10 2017 10:21AM    •    Updated 7 hours ago Share This Article ARTICLE PHOTO GALLERY (1) Long ago and far away, when I was a young special assistant first to Attorney General William French Smith and then to Attorney General Edwin Meese, the young staff would automatically stand up whenever William Webster, then head of the FBI, walked into a room. At Friday morning round-table briefings in the attorney general's massive conference room, when Webster spoke, everyone leaned in. He had the bearing, the competence and the character of the nation's top and trusted cop. Last summer an old D.C. hand took me to one of those Beltway places of lore for lunch and a cigar and talked candidly about how shocked he was at then-FBI Director James B. Comey's decision to publicly discuss the Hillary Clinton email investigation and to walk the public through a hundred details of the case and then conclude she should not be prosecuted. VIDEOS TOP JOBS Agree or disagree with that decision, he said, it's not what the FBI does. Ever. Agents present facts to prosecutors. They may nudge or even push in one direction or the other, but they don't decide. My interlocutor, a former assistant U.S. attorney and then-senior official in numerous positions and companies, was not so much outraged by Comey's actions at the time as puzzled, perhaps even shocked. Apparently, new Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein shared exactly that view and expressed it succinctly in his three-page memo to Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Confidence in the FBI would not come back until a new director was in place, and that, of course, requires that Comey be fired. Not a decision to be taken lightly, Rosenstein argued, but one he recommended that Sessions make. Sessions reviewed the recommendation, concurred and forwarded a joint recommendation to the president, who agreed. Anyone who thinks this is connected to a cover-up of "Russian collusion" has to believe that both Rosenstein and Sessions would participate in such a corrupt scheme. I don't. It is, in fact, absurd to think that. Reread the Rosenstein memo — a few times. There's the story. Comey was wrong in July, wrong in subsequent statements, wrong as recently as last week and refused to admit error. The story is a straight-line one, and it's about Rosenstein. In fact, just last week Comey said this in response to a question from Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., about whether Rosenstein should appoint a special prosecutor in the Russian investigations: "That's a judgment he'll have to make. He is, as I hoped I was as deputy attorney general, a very independent-minded, career-oriented person, but it'd be premature for me to comment on that." That's Comey on Rosenstein. Last week. Under oath. Which doesn't mean that questions about the investigation of Russia's attack on our election are any less serious or the need for a thorough inquiry into charges of collusion between Russia and anyone in the many circles of President Trump is any less pressing. It just means that the FBI has to be led by someone like Webster to assure that both sides of deeply divided D.C. accept the results of all facets of the investigation. Moreover, at last week's hearing Comey told Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., that there are 2,000 investigations into would-be "violent extremists" — half home-grown and in the "lone wolf" category, the other half in contact with foreign organizations (of whom about 300 are immigrants to the United States). That's a massive threat. The FBI is the chief bulwark against it as well as against all cybercrime from abroad (government-sponsored and private criminal activity) and organized crime at home. The director simply cannot lack the confidence of the deputy attorney general or the attorney general. So whom to turn to? Most definitely someone in the Webster mold, which means a current or former federal judge of stellar reputation for both character and competence, and perhaps with some charisma that could prove useful in rallying the FBI and the Justice Department. Someone like J. Michael Luttig, former 4th Circuit judge and now-general counsel for Boeing; U.S. District Judge Richard J. Leon, who has handled scores of terrorism cases; or Stephen Larson, one of my law partners, a former federal judge and former head of the organized-crime division of the U.S. Attorney's Office for California's Central District. There are, in fact, plenty of superb candidates in the mold of these three that must bring stature and independence to the job. But first we have to endure a few days of over-the-top takes from the always overwrought mainstream media. This isn't the "Saturday Night Massacre." There are no tapes, no subpoenas for presidential documents, no resignations from the Justice Department, but instead recommendations from the Justice Department. It's four months into an administration, not four years. In short, the overwrought media has toppled into hysteria again.   Share This Article ARTICLE PHOTO GALLERY VIEW PHOTO GALLERY JOIN THE DISCUSSION     Post a Comment POPULAR OPINION Tribune Editorial: Hatch continues to belittle Native Americans in Bears Ears dispute Op-ed: Even downtown shelter is better than sleeping in a car, and I know Bagley Cartoon: The Russian Republic of Trumpistan Op-ed: A local view of Bears Ears National Monument E.J.

Leon, who has handled scores of terrorism cases; or Stephen Larson, one of my law partners, a former federal judge and formerhead of the organized-crime division of the U.S. Attorney's Office for California's Central District. There are, in fact, plenty of superb candidates in the mold of these three that must bring stature and independence to the job. But first we have to endure a few days of over-the-top takes from the always overwrought mainstream media. This isn't the "Saturday Night Massacre." There are no tapes, no subpoenas for presidential documents, no resignations from the Justice Department, but instead recommendations from the Justice Department. It's four months into an administration, not four years. In short, the overwrought media has toppled into hysteria again.

Agency that tallies them in “wait and see” mode Comcast NBCUniversal is buying Denver’s home-grown video startup Craftsy Broncos reach agreements with rookies De’Angelo Henderson, Chad Kelly; waive James Ferentz Feldman: Trump’s firing of Comey is a crisis of American rule of law Rod Rosenstein, the deputy U.S. attorney general, listens during his confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee on March 7. Following Rosenstein’s recommendation, President Donald Trump fired FBI Director James Comey on Tuesday. Long ago and far away, when I was a young special assistant first to Attorney General William French Smith and then to Attorney General Edwin Meese, the young staff would automatically stand up whenever William Webster, then head of the FBI, walked into a room. At Friday morning round-table briefings in the attorney general’s massive conference room, when Webster spoke, everyone leaned in. He had the bearing, the competence and the character of the nation’s top and trusted cop. Last summer an old D.C. hand took me to one of those Beltway places of lore for lunch and a cigar and talked candidly about how shocked he was at then-FBI Director James Comey’s decision to publicly discuss the Hillary Clinton email investigation and to walk the public through a hundred details of the case and then conclude she should not be prosecuted. Agree or disagree with that decision, he said, it’s not what the FBI does. Ever. Agents present facts to prosecutors. They may nudge or even push in one direction or the other, but they don’t decide. My interlocutor, a former assistant U.S. attorney and then-senior official in numerous positions and companies, was not so much outraged by Comey’s actions at the time as puzzled, perhaps even shocked. Apparently, new Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein shared exactly that view and expressed it succinctly in his three-page memo to Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Confidence in the FBI would not come back until a new director was in place, and that, of course, requires that Comey be fired. Not a decision to be taken lightly, Rosenstein argued, but one he recommended that Sessions make. Sessions reviewed the recommendation, concurred and forwarded a joint recommendation to the president, who agreed. Anyone who thinks this is connected to a cover-up of “Russian collusion” has to believe that both Rosenstein and Sessions would participate in such a corrupt scheme. I don’t. It is, in fact, absurd to think that. Reread the Rosenstein memo — a few times. There’s the story. Comey was wrong in July, wrong in subsequent statements, wrong as recently as last week and refused to admit error. The story is a straight-line one, and it’s about Rosenstein. In fact, just last week Comey said this in response to a question from Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., about whether Rosenstein should appoint a special prosecutor in the Russian investigations: “That’s a judgment he’ll have to make. He is, as I hoped I was as deputy attorney general, a very independent-minded, career-oriented person, but it’d be premature for me to comment on that.” That’s Comey on Rosenstein. Last week. Under oath. Which doesn’t mean that questions about the investigation of Russia’s attack on our election are any less serious or the need for a thorough inquiry into charges of collusion between Russia and anyone in the many circles of President Donald Trump is any less pressing. It just means that the FBI has to be led by someone like Webster to assure that both sides of deeply divided D.C. accept the results of all facets of the investigation. Moreover, at last week’s hearing Comey told Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., that there are 2,000 investigations into would-be “violent extremists” — half homegrown and in the “lone wolf” category, the other half in contact with foreign organizations (of whom about 300 are immigrants to the United States). That’s a massive threat. The FBI is the chief bulwark against it as well as against all cybercrime from abroad (government-sponsored and private criminal activity) and organized crime at home. The director simply cannot lack the confidence of the deputy attorney general or the attorney general. So whom to turn to? Most definitely someone in the Webster mold, which means a current or former federal judge of stellar reputation for both character and competence, and perhaps with some charisma that could prove useful in rallying the FBI and the Justice Department. Someone like J. Michael Luttig, former 4th Circuit judge and now-general counsel for Boeing; U.S. District Judge Richard J. Leon, who has handled scores of terrorism cases; or Stephen Larson, one of my law partners, a former federal judge and former head of the organized-crime division of the U.S. Attorney’s Office for California’s Central District.

Tags:  Donald Trump FBI James Comey James Comey firing Richard Nixon Click for Digital & Home Delivery - 50% blog comments powered by Disqus More in Opinion Columnists Robinson: Trump’s firing of Comey is a thuggish abuse of executive power May 10, 2017, 4:32 pm Donald Trump’s firing of James Comey has to be the most thuggish, venal act committed by a U.S. president since Richard Nixon’s desperate Saturday Night Massacre. Guest Commentary: I was sexually assaulted — even though it’s 2017 May 10, 2017, 9:50 am The problem is not that the institutions we attend lack the resources to help victims. The problem is that sexual assault is still in the present tense, it is happening. Bump: Trump has given every reason to believe he fired Comey over Russia investigation May 10, 2017, 4:32 pm Donald Trump has offered repeated evidence that the Russia probe is why he wanted James Comey to be gone, and essentially no evidence that he was concerned about the administration’s public reason. Feldman: Trump’s firing of Comey is a crisis of American rule of law May 10, 2017, 4:32 pm There is reason to be deeply concerned about James Comey’s firing, which has the effect of politicizing law enforcement — a risky precedent in a rule-of-law democracy.

But first, you need to manage the flood of data. by Justin Bachman @justinbachman More stories by Justin Bachman May 10, 2017, 10:00 AM EDT At some point in the not-too-distant future, fleets of commercial drones are expected to swarm across American skies. Companies in a wide range of industries will employ unmanned vehicles for tactical advantage—inspecting infrastructure, surveying crops, maybe even estimating how much your new roof will cost.  And when these drones fly, a torrent of data will follow them like an invisible contrail. “Data is the new oil,” Intel Corp. Chief Executive Officer Brian Krzanich said this week at the Association for Unmanned Vehicle Systems International’s annual Xponential conference in Dallas, the industry’s top trade show. He cited a growing competitive “separation” between companies that collect and understand their data and those that don’t. A single autonomous car can generate the same data trove as 3,000 people surfing the internet, while a small drone fleet could easily create 150 terabytes of data per day, he said (1,000 gigabytes equals 1 terabyte). “The data rate is going to explode on us in the next few years,” Krzanich said. But how to handle that wide open fire hose of information? “Operation of an unmanned system is no longer a stand-alone activity,” Lockheed Martin Corp. proclaims in its promotional materials for its Hydra Fusion Tools software. “There [is] an assortment of maps, images, video, and intelligence which are being broadcast to the operators and this needs to be fused into a common operational picture.” This proposition, unsurprisingly, is leading to an array of new business models aimed at helping companies sift through and exploit the mountains of information headed their way.  Into this universe comes Airbus SE, the European aerospace conglomerate. Airbus is starting a new data company, called Airbus Aerial, to provide an array of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) services, a field the company estimates could increase to more than $120 billion annually as the use of these fleets expands, said Dirk Hoke, CEO of Airbus’s defence and space group. Hoke introduced the new company Wednesday at Xponential. Power companies across the U.S. are testing whether drones can spot trouble on transmission lines. Photographer: John Bazemore/AP Photo The proliferation of commercial drones won’t be so much about getting your pizza or new shirt faster—although there is that consideration—but a broader change in how companies employ aerial surveillance and data to inform their businesses, spurred by efficiency and new U.S. rules allowing commercial unmanned systems to operate at farther distances, autonomously. A diverse array of companies, ranging from insurers and utilities to real estate and energy, are likely to shift some of their operations to UAV. Some of the work now done by helicopters could be replaced at lower cost. Insurers, for example, are finding aerial surveillance to be a good method for assessing claims after tornadoes and hurricanes and to help understand risks in their underwriting activities. Airbus Aerial aims to compile high-altitude data from a fleet of eight Airbus satellites and drones, blending it into an intelligence service for agriculture, insurance, oil and gas, utilities, and state and local governments. Aerial will be based in Germany, near Munich, with U.S. offices in Atlanta. The company sees 2017 as a way to explore the market, testing the business with “a small, select group of customers” to determine how clients will value Aerial’s services, said Jana Rosenmann, Airbus senior vice president of unmanned aerial systems. Airbus will fly third-party drones for its clients but will also explore building its own hardware, she said. “The initial business is not relying on Airbus having its own drone today,” Rosenmann said in a telephone interview. Airbus Zephyr. Source: Airbus Defence and Space The company already operates high-altitude solar-powered UAVs, dubbed Zephyr, which has stayed aloft for as long as 14 days. Airbus calls Zephyr “a high-altitude pseudo satellite” due to its high cruising level of up to 70,000 feet.  Most customers will have a specific need for the services of companies like Aerial and won’t care how the information is acquired, be it by drone, satellite, or other means, said Jesse Kallman, who will lead the Airbus unit’s U.S. operations. “A drone is really just a truck that you stick a sensor on,” he said. “We will use whatever hardware makes the most sense.” Aerial pricing is likely to be tailored to a specific market or customer, Kallman said, ranging from recurring subscriptions to one-off jobs.  To date, one of the major impediments to commercial drone flying has been the lack of federal rules, which are now pending at the Federal Aviation Administration. The regulations sort out operational guidelines to integrate UAVs safely into existing air traffic. Although slow to get these rules squared away, the American UAV service market may mature more quickly than in Europe, owing to the U.S. having only a single regulatory body, Hoke said.

Source: Airbus Defence and Space The field of drone services has already begun seeing consolidation among smaller players, with much of the business focused on courting large companies and recurring revenue streams, said Jon Damush, vice president of commercial at Insitu, a Boeing Co. subsidiary that builds and flies drones. Over time, given the cost of contracting with a drone service, some of the larger drone data users—such as miners and pipeline operators—might decide to buy their own drones and software. “When you become a certain size on the expense line, somebody’s going to notice,” Damush said. But Kanji counters that there’s room “for a lot of different vendors,” from companies that offer just data storage to others that may sell analysis, data collection, or a combination. Some of these data wranglers focus on software, offering drone users the ability to create detailed interfaces for the data that UAVs emit. Others, such as Insitu, focus on drone reconnaissance and data analysis for railroads, large mining companies in Australia, and pipeline operators. That’s the larger-scale end of the business, leaving many smaller players eager to exploit common drone necessities among many industries. “One thing we’ve found is that with agriculture, utilities, railroads, and construction, a lot of them have very similar needs,” Kanji said, citing one example: “All of them worry about vegetation.”  Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Comey’s tenure — which began in the fall of 2013 — coincided with a dramatic shift in how the country viewed cyber crime and cybersecurity. He started a few months after NSA contractor Edward Snowden exposed the expansive underbelly of the government’s surveillance apparatus, and just months before a spate of massive data breaches at companies like Target, Home Depot and JPMorgan Chase brought digital crime into the national spotlight for the first time. Story Continued Below Comey’s response to the changing times earned him many fans, but no shortage of critics. Backers, which included many law enforcement colleagues and a number of lawmakers, “praised the FBI chief for his dogged focus on tackling the rapid proliferation of digital crime,” the Pro Cyber team reported. “Comey’s tenure included investigations that led to the first charges ever brought against alleged government-backed hackers in China, Russia and Iran, as well as the capture of numerous elusive foreign hackers that some assumed were forever out of the reach of U.S. authorities.” “Comey's leadership and advocacy on any topic about which he is passionate have been unmatched,” Anthony J. Ferrante, a former chief of staff in the FBI’s cyber division and later a cyber official at the White House, told MC. “He has worked tirelessly on behalf of the ideals of justice for nearly 20 years,” added Ferrante, now head of cybersecurity at FTI Consulting. But the tech and privacy community have a much different take on Comey’s cyber legacy. “Comey’s insistence that investigators needed guaranteed access to encrypted communications — and his defense of certain government surveillance programs — left a bitter taste in the mouths of many in the tech and privacy community,” the cyber team reported. Pros can get the full rundown on Comey’s cyber legacy here. Over at POLITICO Magazine, Garrett Graff also has some good insight on Comey’s broader legacy. POLITICO's Josh Dawsey also had a look at how the firing went down. — COMEY’S CAPITOL HILL FALLOUT: Comey’s dismissal is sure to dominate discussions on Capitol Hill this week, and the fallout has already begun. Despite misgivings about Comey’s tenure from both the left and the right, he had earned the trust of Senate Intelligence Chairman Richard Burr and top panel Democrat Mark Warner, both of whom said Comey was forthcoming with them and helpful to their own Russia probe. Both said they were troubled by Comey’s unceremonious axing. One Intel panel member, though, Sen. Joe Manchin, said he expected the firing wouldn’t have a big impact and that Comey could testify before the committee just as other former officials have. But some Democrats, foremost among them Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, have now revived calls for a special prosecutor or independent investigation to look into the issue, an idea Republicans again dismissed.

LAMAR SMITH Q&A — House Science Chairman Lamar Smith has transformed his panel into an “unexpected hub of cybersecurity activity,” Eric and Tim write for Pros in a story out this morning based on an interview with the Texas Republican last week. Smith talked about some of his panel’s legislative efforts, like a pair of bills giving new directives to technical standards agency NIST to audit federal agencies and aid small businesses. Below are a couple more highlights. Pros can get the full interview here. On whether he’ll investigate Trump’s oft-criticized personal device security: “No. I haven’t seen any evidence that anybody has taken advantage of that, or that there were any leaks or anything like that.” On his overall perspective on cybersecurity: “Cybersecurity is a subject that is growing in importance by the hour. Cybersecurity — or, I should say, cyber insecurity — cyberattacks are a threat to our country, our economy and to the privacy of individuals. And that’s why everybody needs to appreciate that Congress is trying to prevent cyberattacks, trying to come up with ways to make our agencies more secure and come up with ways to help small businesses as far as that goes.” TODAY: HSGAC PREPS CYBER FOUNDATION — The Senate Homeland Security Committee is holding its first major cybersecurity hearing of the year, with Chairman Ron Johnson saying in his prepared opening remarks that the session is meant to lay the groundwork for the panel’s work this Congress. “Before we can begin to discuss solutions, we must first understand the threats and trends associated with these threats,” Johnson is expected to say. He’ll offer a hint of his focus, too: “Emerging trends include the rise of ransomware and botnets as easy-to-use tactics that offer big rewards for cybercriminals.” Johnson’s committee will hear from a number of cybersecurity experts. One of them, former top FBI cyber official Steve Chabinsky, will argue that the United States needs to get more proactive. “The U.S. should lead international efforts that find higher-level solutions that solve problems before they get to everyone,” Chabinsky, a partner at White & Case, told MC via email in advance of his testimony. “This would include going after the hackers, having more secure products and protocols, and cleaning things up at the Internet ecosystem level before the problems reach millions of victims.” An official from Symantec will revisit some of the conclusions in the company’s recent annual threat report. But Jeff Greene, Symantec’s senior director for global government affairs and policy, will also recommend a range of protective measures, according to his written testimony, many of them technological, like using encryption and multiple factors to verify users’ identities. KASPERSKY KASPER-SPY? — Long-simmering tensions over Russian cybersecurity firm Kaspersky Lab burst into the open this week, as current and former U.S. officials voiced concerns that Kaspersky’s security software could let the Kremlin hack into government networks. ABC News reported Tuesday that the FBI was investigating the company, that the Department of Homeland Security had issued a secret report about its products and that the Senate Intelligence Committee had asked senior Trump administration officials to address what it called this “important national security issue.” Federal, state and local government agencies across the country use Kaspersky products, as do some American embassies. But officials are worried about a Russian security law that lets the Kremlin “monitor and record all data that traverses Russia’s networks” — in the words of a State Department memo — which could include Kaspersky customer data sent to the company’s headquarters. In its response to the concerns — which first resurfaced in a BuzzFeed story on Monday — Kaspersky said it “has no ties to any government” and “has never helped, nor will help, any government in the world with its cyberespionage efforts.” The company also noted that customers can disable the transmission of sensitive data back to Moscow. “In addition, business and government users may choose to install a local and private Kaspersky Security Network (KSN) center on their premises to make sure the data never leaves their facility,” the company added. Eugene Kaspersky, the company’s founder, on Twitter accused a U.S. journalist of trying to “cook [up] a new BIG conspiracy story.” He also announced that he’d answer Reddit questions on Thursday as part of the site’s “Ask Me Anything” series. In its statement, Kaspersky said it was “available to assist all concerned government organizations with any ongoing investigations” and that it “ardently believes a deeper examination of Kaspersky Lab will confirm that these allegations are unfounded.” LOOKING OUT FOR THE LITTLE GUY — The FTC on Tuesday launched a new resource for small businesses seeking information about cyber threats. The FTC’s new small-business portal collects existing material, including “plain language guidance” on responding to data breaches and protecting customer information, as well as commission blog posts on cyber topics like the NIST framework. “Small businesses are critical to our economic strength, building America's future, and helping the United States compete in today's global marketplace,” said acting FTC Chairman Maureen Ohlhausen in a statement. “This innovative new website is a one-stop shop where small businesses can find information to protect themselves from scammers and hackers, as well as resources they can use if they are hit with a cyberattack.” THE CYBER GORDIAN KNOT — U.S. Cyber Command last year successfully hacked the Islamic State’s propaganda machine and promptly set off a debate about the authorities the military enjoys in cyberspace and what role, if any, allies should play in such digital operations, The Washington Post reports. The article comes as the Trump administration continues to review, and potentially revise, how the entire federal government, not just the Pentagon, handles cyber. The new structure was supposed to be spelled out in a plan the administration vowed to release within its first 90 days in office, but that self-imposed deadline came and went without any explanation from the White House — a fact not lost on Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John McCain. In a Tuesday hearing with Cyber Command chief Adm. Mike Rogers, McCain called the lack of action “disheartening.” Rogers admitted the plan hasn’t been rolled out yet “but the new team is working on that. … I want to make sure we all understand that.” McCain replied: “And the check's in the mail?” LOGGING CYBER VISITS — POLITICO’s cyber watchers will find visits and calls of interest in POLITICO’s unofficial White House visitor logs, from world leaders (Chinese President Xi Jinping warrants several mentions) to top Cabinet officials (Secretary of State Rex Tillerson stops by plenty). It doesn’t feature very many visitors explicitly focused on the cybersecurity business, other than perhaps Keith Alexander, the former NSA chief who now runs IronNet Cybersecurity. But the logs show a good many leaders of companies with at least some cyber biz: Accenture, Boeing, Dell, Deloitte, General Dynamics, IBM, Infor, Intel and Lockheed Martin. See the whole list here. TWEET OF THE DAY — [awkward grimace emoji] RECENTLY ON PRO CYBERSECURITY — The White House maintains that it fired former national security adviser Michael Flynn at the right time. … “Sens. Brian Schatz and Ron Wyden wrote to the FCC today asking for more information on what the agency said was a distributed denial-of-service attack on its website where the public can comment on the commission's net neutrality proceeding.” … Activist group Fight for the Future said the FCC’s servers struggled again after HBO re-aired John Oliver’s calls to comment on net neutrality. … Sen. Dick Durbin wants the Trump administration to say whether it believes Russia is behind the cyberattacks on French President-elect Emmanuel Macron, and condemn Moscow if so. … Sen. Angus King suggested to appropriators that they allocate $160 million for election result audits to counter hackers. REPORT WATCH — Pandalabs, a division of Panda Security, says it detected more than 350,000 new cyberattacks daily in the first quarter 2017. Digital criminals also raked in more than $1 billion through ransomware last year, the firm concludes in a new study out today.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 10 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Federal Agency Websites Still Failing to Provide Citizens with Clear Information, According to VisibleThread Report. BALTIMORE–(BUSINESS WIRE)–VisibleThread, today announced findings from its website clarity review of 30 US Federal Agencies. Following the introduction of the Plain Writing Act 2010, VisibleThread first published this review in 2011 and then again in 2016. The 2017 analysis is a follow-up and comparison of federal agency websites indexed in 2016. The agencies with the overall best scores were: The National Archives, Centers for Disease Control and The Community Oriented Policing Service. To see the full list of agencies across each clarity category, view the report at: http://info.visiblethread.com/2017-US-Government-Index. The analysis measured up to 100 pages on each website, across these 4 dimensions: Readability: How readable is the content? Passive Language vs Active Language. What proportion of sentences are passive? Long Sentences: What proportion of all sentences are too long? Word Complexity Density: Proportion of complex words relative to total word count. Why is this report relevant? Seven years ago, the passage of the Plain Writing Act 2010 mandated clear communications in materials for U.S. citizens. Under the Act, federal agencies are required to use writing that is concise, clear and appropriate for the audience. At a minimum, readers with a high school level of education should be able to understand the content that is written on government websites. “Clear communication saves agencies time and money, which is a win for both government and taxpayer,” said Fergal McGovern, CEO, VisibleThread. “In a time when policy favors fiscal conservatism, a focus on plain language helps agencies manage change and achieve greater compliance, when they typically have fewer resources.” Complex language can negatively impact communication with the public. The result is often unforeseen and unnecessary costs. VisibleThread’s report demonstrates examples of language that may have this unintended effect, similar to the following: “In accordance with 49 U.S.C. 24405(a)(7), a person or entity is ineligible to receive any contract or subcontract made with XYZ grant funds if a court or department, agency, or instrumentality of the Government decides the person intentionally – (A) affixed a „Made in America” label, or a label with an inscription having the same meaning, to goods sold in or shipped to the United States that are used in a project to which this subsection applies but not produced in the United States; or (B) represented that goods described in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph were produced in the United States.” About VisibleThread VisibleThread’s solutions help organizations test & audit their written content for risk and content quality, with dramatically less cost. Customers include; Boeing, Intel, Accenture and Fannie Mae. Our software instantly finds brand compliance, poor readability and language risk issues within documents and entire websites.
