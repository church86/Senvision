At right, historical photographs detailing NASA accomplishments are on display near an Alfa rocket test stand, also pictured in 2014. U.S. Rep. Steve Knight is spearheading an effort to save the remaining rocket test stands and preserve the Chumash cave paintings at the Santa Susana Field Lab in the southern hills of Simi Valley. On March 21, Knight (R-Simi Valley) sent a letter to Robert Lightfoot, NASA’s acting administrator, urging the preservation of the test stands and cave paintings due to their “legacy and symbolic importance.” “This is a two-pronged effort to make sure that we do everything we can to preserve some of the historical value of . . . what we’ve done in the space industry and also to make sure the American Indian sacred sites are guarded,” Knight told the Simi Valley Acorn on Tuesday. “We don’t want those (stands) to just get mowed over, because then what protections would there be for the sacred sites? This is not just a part of space history, it’s part of Southern California’s history.” ACORN FILE PHOTOS In the letter, Knight cites the field lab’s involvement in the first American-made rocket engine in 1950; in 33 Saturn and Apollo missions, including the first mission to land a man on the moon in 1969; and in the work with the Space Shuttle starting in 1981. The 2,850-acre field lab, however, had also been used for decades as a nuclear test site and for research in the development of ballistic missiles. Today, Boeing Co. owns 80 percent of the property, including Area IV where a partial nuclear meltdown occurred in 1959. The federal government owns the remaining 20 percent, including Area II, where six remaining historic rocket test stands and cave paintings are located. A complex multi- agency cleanup effort by Boeing, NASA, the Department of Toxic Substances Control and U.S Department of Energy has been underway at SSFL for nearly a decade. Per cleanup agreements, NASA began demolishing buildings on the federal government’s portion of the site in 2014, although takedown of the test stands was deferred in 2015 after some activists began calling for preservation. ‘Very troubling’ Denise Duffield, who is lobbying for a cleanup of the entire field lab to background standards— meaning all materials unnatural to the site would be removed—said it is impossible to remove all contamination from SSFL and preserve the test stands. “Most of the contamination on NASA’s property is located under and near the test stands. We’re talking about very toxic materials and in very high quantities,” Duffield said. She said Knight’s letter is “very troubling” and she’s concerned it will be used by NASA and Boeing to push for weaker cleanup standards. Current agreements in place require NASA to clean up Area II to background standards, while certain portions of the field lab under Boeing’s charge must be remediated to suburban residential standards—meaning people could live on-site without getting sick from contamination. (Despite the standards, Boeing intends to preserve its portion as open space.) “From a public health perspective, the SSFL site must be fully cleaned up before there is even consideration of designating it a park or national monument,” Duffield said. “Otherwise, the polluters will use the park status to (leave) gross quantities of toxic materials on the site that will continue to migrate and impact local communities.” But Knight argues that preserving the stands will not impede remediation. “The cleanup is still one of our highest priorities, ensuring that it’s cleaned up to . . . where people can go enjoy a recreational-type of place,” the congressman said. ‘Preserve and protect’ In 2015, activist Christina Walsh started a petition on change.org asking President Barack Obama to designate the site as a national monument in an effort to preserve the test stands and the cave paintings. Although the petition is what caused NASA to defer demolition of the test stands two years ago, it seems to have stalled, as no updates have been posted since July 2015. Knight said his letter—which was signed by U.S. Reps. Julia Brownley (D-Thousand Oaks), Ted Lieu (D-Los Angeles), Tony Cardenas (D-Van Nuys), Adam Schiff (D-Burbank) and Brad Sherman (D-Sherman Oaks)—is separate from Walsh’s effort. In a statement provided in an email to the Acorn, Brownley said everything should be done to “preserve and protect important cultural and historic features,” a task she believes can be accomplished while still meeting cleanup requirements. “The beautiful cave paintings . . . juxtaposed with the test stands from NASA’s Mercury and Apollo era create a unique and remarkable cultural and historic connection between this ancient Native American astronomical observatory and religious shrine and the site’s role in propelling us into the modern space age,” Brownley said. Jennifer Stanfield, a NASA spokesperson, confirmed the agency has received Knight’s letter but declined to answer specific questions about what happens next. The agency only provided a statement saying NASA is as “equally committed to preserving the cultural legacy of the site” as it is to protecting human health and the environment. “We appreciate the significant public interest in the site’s rich history and at this time plan to continue to defer demolition of the historic test stand structures, unless they pose risks to safety, health or the environment that cannot be mitigated,” the statement reads.

Both Airbus and Boeing now offer aircraft that appear capable of flying non-stop commercial flights from Sydney to London - the "Holy Grail" for Australian carrier Qantas Airways Ltd. As long as oil prices don't go much higher than around USD 70 per barrel, the 20-hour flight can be financially viable, and could be on schedules within five years, aviation experts say. Airbus has increased the range of its A350-900ULR to 9,700 nautical miles (17,960 kms) from the 8,700 nautical miles announced when it sold the plane to Singapore Airlines in 2015 for delivery next year, a spokesman told Reuters. Including headwinds, the Sydney-London flight is equivalent to 9,600 nautical miles. "These aircraft, we think, are potentially real goers on these routes," Qantas CEO Alan Joyce told Reuters of the A350-900ULR and the bigger but less advanced Boeing 777-8. "You know from what they have done on other aircraft that Sydney-London and Melbourne-London has real possibility." For Qantas, a non-stop Sydney-London route that cuts three hours off the flight time would allow it to charge a premium and differentiate its product from the around two dozen other airlines plying the so-called Kangaroo route with stop-offs in Singapore, Dubai and Hong Kong. The route accounts for only 13 percent of Qantas' international capacity, but carries the prestige QF1 flight number and is important to its global brand. Qantas could charge around a 20 percent price premium for a non-stop Sydney-London flight as it would attract business and premium leisure travellers wanting to complete the trip as fast as possible, said Rico Merkert, a professor specialising in transport at the University of Sydney's business school. "It's something that can be presented as a unique selling point for Qantas," he said. FUELLING DOUBTS Qantas begins non-stop flights from Perth to London next year, using the Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner. For this scheduled flight, the Dreamliner will have fewer seats than usual, will use the most advanced flight path modelling methods, and will reduce the weight in areas seemingly as minor as the dishes and forks. The Perth flight will take 17 hours - a far cry from the four days and seven stops it took when Qantas created the Kangaroo Route to London in 1947. Qantas can offset the higher cost of carrying more fuel to complete the flight by saving on stopover costs, such as airport charges, ground handling, taxes, crew hotel rooms and lounge usage. "In terms of economics, much depends on fuel prices," said Teal Group aerospace analyst Richard Aboulafia. "If they stay at $50 a barrel or less, it should be possible to keep costs reasonable. But as fuel goes up, the disadvantages of flying a very heavy plane begin to make ultra-long haul problematic." He said the flight should remain economic at prices below around $70 a barrel, though Leeham Co analyst Bjorn Fehrm said the actual level could be far higher as one-stop rivals would also be squeezed by higher oil prices. Singapore Airlines ended its New York and Los Angeles flights using the four-engined A340-500 in 2013 when oil prices topped $107 a barrel. The carrier is now waiting for delivery of the far more fuel-efficient twin-engined A350-900ULR next year. HEADWINDS Qantas is pushing the planemakers hard on a stretch goal of completing the Sydney-London flight with 300 seats to give it the highest possible revenue and fleet flexibility. However, Fehrm said the aircraft would likely fall short of that goal if Qantas wanted to avoid a fuel stop on the westbound leg when headwinds are strongest. If such stopovers became frequent enough, Qantas would lose its ability to charge a premium on the route. Two aviation industry sources said the Airbus A350-900ULR would fit more than 250 passengers on the Sydney-London route, up from the 170 mainly business-class seats on Singapore Airlines' configuration for flights to New York and Los Angeles. Boeing's 777-8, due to enter service early in the next decade, could carry around 280 passengers on the westbound leg of the Sydney-London flight, the sources said. The sources declined to be named because the configuration details are not finalised. Airbus and Boeing declined to comment specifically on the seat count. "We think our airplane has the legs and the capability," said Dinesh Keskar, Boeing Senior Vice President Sales Asia-Pacific and India. "If the 787-9 can do Perth-London, we think that when the 777-8 comes out in the 2021 timeframe we will have a lot more improvement in technology." Airbus, Boeing and engine manufacturers are constantly investing to reduce fuel usage, extending a plane's range and its ability to perform in hot conditions like the Middle East. That means the planemakers don't have to invest specifically for any Qantas order, the size of which is still unclear. Pushing the seat count towards 300 would also give Qantas the flexibility to use these aircraft on other long routes, such as a mooted Sydney-New York flight, as it looks to replace six ageing 747-400ER planes and eventually its fleet of 12 A380s. BEST PRICING Qantas' Joyce has raised publicly the possibility of ordering the 777-8 for ultra-long haul flights for the last two years, but the A350-900ULR has entered the equation more recently. "It has added competition, and we would be crazy if we didn't do a competition at the right time," Joyce said. "That gets you the best pricing and ... the most capable aircraft." Qantas has yet to launch a formal tender process for the prestige order, as it waits for Boeing to finalise the specifications on the 777-8. But the first Sydney-London flights are possible around 2022, Joyce said."The Kangaroo route is probably the most competitive on the globe," Joyce said. "(Flying non-stop) takes us off this superhighway of very competitive conditions of capacity which is priced, in many cases, under costs." tags #Airbus #Boeing #Qantas Airways #World News Related news Business Asian spot LNG prices edge up on slightly tighter market Apr 07, 2017 10:56 AM Business Hyundai, Kia plan major car recall in US and South Korea over engine issue Apr 07, 2017 10:22 AM Business US employment growth seen slowing as warm weather boost fades Apr 07, 2017 10:11 AM Business Adidas to mass-produce 3D-printed shoe with Silicon Valley startup Apr 07, 2017 09:51 AM Business Samsung heir accused of bribery, perjury as trial opens Apr 07, 2017 09:12 AM Business Syria opposition hails US strike, calls for continued action Apr 07, 2017 09:09 AM Business Donald Trump explains why he launched missile attack on Syria Apr 07, 2017 09:08 AM Business Will have a very, very great relationship: Trump on meeting Xi Apr 07, 2017 08:23 AM Business Samsung tips best quarterly profit in over three years as chips soar Apr 07, 2017 08:06 AM News Most Popular Top News Maybe it's time for hostile takeovers; govt must back honest risks: Uday Kotak D-Mart bumper listing: Should you buy, book profits or hold shares?

Reuters/Yuya Shino Aerospace company Boeing is establishing a new office in Adelaide, which will lead to the creation of as many as 250 jobs. Scheduled to open next week, the new office will support advanced military systems and engage in research and development. The project has been financially supported by the South Australian government through Investment Attraction South Australia and Defence SA. The deal for the new office was signed on Thursday by Premier Jay Weatherill and Boeing Defence Australia managing director Darren Edwards. Additionally, the company will be making an investment worth $500,000 for the Techstars global accelerator program. "Part of that program will be providing local start-ups each year with access to experienced mentors, advanced research and technology,” Edwards said, adding that Boeing’s move to South Australia was a “long time coming.” "This is the start of a journey for us. This is the start of growing much bigger in the state," he said. Techstars aids start-up businesses by helping them secure capital, marketing and employees. According to Weatherill, the new Boeing office would lead to flow-on effects for the state’s economy. Additionally, it will better opportunities for its university graduates. "What it's about is young people being able to stay here in Adelaide and get a great job," he said. "It's always been a great place to live, it's becoming a really exciting place to live. The thing that's been missing is the great job." The development comes as good news for South Australia, Weatherill said. It would provide the state with an economic boost, he said, adding that the deal would see an extension beyond its initial period. Boeing has a workforce of almost 140,000 people internationally in manufacturing of commercial airliners, military aircraft and defence, space and security systems. The aerospace company’s presence in Australia has been the largest following the United States. In Australia, the company employs in excess of 3,000 people, majority of who are in Queensland. With the help of the new program in Adelaide, Boeing will aid 10 companies create and commercialise state-of-the-art defence and security and technology. The Adelaide program will run from July until October this year. South Australia recently attracted engineering support services company Babcock, which said last year it was looking to shift its Australasian headquarters from Brisbane to Adelaide owing to the state’s growing Defence industry. The news comes as the state has been continuously losing jobs in car manufacturing and other industries.

In addition to a series of panel discussions, the event also had some impressive technology on display, most notably the replica of Blue Origin's space capsule and a simulator for Boeing's Starliner. We got a chance to check them both out and take a peek at the future of commercial space travel. Blue Origin Sick of Ads? More than 700 New Atlas Plus subscribers read our newsletter and website without ads. Join them for just US$19 a year.More Information Dominating the outdoor space by the entrance to the conference was the New Shepard rocket and crew capsule designed by Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin. The plan is for the rocket to carry passengers above the Kármán line, the edge of Earth's atmosphere, located at a height of 100 km (62 mi), where they can get a glimpse of our planet from a perspective only few have ever enjoyed. Ascent will take place over the course of two and a half minutes and passengers will experience up to 3 g of force, or three times the force of gravity. Once the capsule reaches its height, passengers are welcome to unbuckle themselves from their seats and enjoy weightlessness for four to five minutes. Then it will be time to strap back in for descent, which will generate just under 5 gs. Descent will be slowed to about 20 mph with a chute system and retrorockets cause deceleration down to 3 mph before touchdown. Total time from launch to land will be just over 11 minutes and, while there is no word yet on how much a flight will cost, it's bound to be out of reach for the everyday person. Virgin Galactic's SpaceShipTwo, for example, is slated to cost US$250,000 per ticket. The experience Entering Blue Origin's capsule was like stepping into the luxurious cabin of a fine sports car. Despite being able to seat six people in an area of just 530 cubic-feet along with a rocket stowage capsule designed to provide enough thrust for an escape maneuver should something go wrong with the main rocket, the capsule felt surprisingly spacious. This was largely due to the large windows that take up a full third of the entire capsule and let in 92 percent of visible light. The leather seats are arranged in prone positions around the outer edge of the capsule and were extremely comfortable. Even though you're mostly lying down, there is a slight upward angling that puts you in the perfect position to see out your private window. Also in easy view is a small tablet-style screen that will detail the trip and tell you when to unbuckle and strap back up, as the autonomous journey will not be manned by a Blue Origin crew member. If you are going to travel to space, believe us, this is the way you'd want to do it. Starliner With a cutaway version of its capsule and a simulated version of the cockpit, Boeing's offering in the commercial space transit arena, the Starliner, wasn't quite as far along as Blue Origin's, but then again, it's a more ambitious project. The Starliner is being designed to take passengers higher than the Blue Origin capsule – all the way into low-Earth orbit or straight to the International Space Station (ISS). The capsule will be able to hold seven passengers for space tourism purposes or, when heading to the ISS, it will hold four crew members in addition to cargo. The Starliner is due for pad abort testing in White Sands, New Mexico next year to test the ability of the capsule to escape the Atlas V rocket that will carry it to space, followed by both un-crewed and crewed tests in the same year. The experience The Starliner simulator was like playing a kind of boring video game in an airplane cockpit. "We're going to be flying the CST-100 spacecraft to a docking with the International Space Station at Node 2 forward," said Dan Nelson, a guidance navigation control engineer for Boeing. "So we're going to be flying down this imaginary cone here extending from the docking port that's called the docking corridor. We want to be moving down this corridor fast enough that the docking clamps engage at the end, but not so fast that we break hardware and NASA sends us a huge bill. The rate we want to be going is between 0.03 and 0.06 meters per second." While that all sounded pretty intimidating, the process actually just involved using a small joystick that controlled direction with a rocker switch on top for thrust. Thanks to Nelson's instruction, the docking maneuver took just about three minutes and was fairly uneventful. While it didn't make for the most thrilling experience, when you're trying to attach to a space station whizzing around the planet at just under five miles per second, uneventful is exactly what you're looking for. Also included as part of the Boeing exhibit was the lightweight spacesuit travelers on the Starliner will need to don. That suit, in addition to many other pieces of space tech will be highlighted in our forthcoming gallery from the show floor.

By Taurai Mangudhla RwandAir flies to 20 destinations in West, East, Central and Southern Africa. It started flying to Harare this week. RwandAir, established 15 years ago, made its maiden Kigali-Harare flight on Wednesday amid pomp and fanfare. The milestone was a stark contract to its host; Air Zimbabwe, once a thriving airline at Independence in 1980 with 18 planes. While RwandAir is expanding fast, AirZim is shrinking and now faces the prospect of liquidation to start afresh from the ashes of failure. Years of extended mismanagement have seen its fleet reduce to only four, Modern Ark: MA60, Boeing: B737-200 Advanced, B767-200ER and an Airbus A320-200. RwandAir’s fleet of 11 aircraft is made up of two wide body planes (A330-300 and A330-200), three Boeing 737-800, two Boeing 737-700, two Bombadier CRJ-900 and two Bombadier Q400. Another modern aircraft is expected to be added to the family soon and allow the airline to pursue its expansion strategy effectively. Recently, the airline introduced Kigali-Mumbai flights as it expands its wings across the globe. Rwanda’s flag carrier RwandAir targets an average 60% load factor on its KigaliHarare flights, management has said. At an average 60% load factor, the airline will carry about 16 500 passengers on the route, RwandAir general manager commercial Mikael Gobena said on the side lines of a reception of the inaugural flight to Harare on Wednesday. “We are looking at about 60% load factor, we fly the (Bombadier CRJ-900) CRJ here that would be about 45 passengers per flight multiplied by 365 days,” Gobena said. “The main driver to achieve the 60% load factor is the service, affordable prices joined together.” “The source of passengers is traders, businessmen, and tourists not only from Harare, but also into Harare so we will have these tourists and investors. There are a number of sources, but we expect traders to drive.” Gobena said RwandAir currently flies to 20 destinations in West, East, Central and Southern Africa and plans to introduce new routes to Europe and the United States. Next week, Rwandese civil aviation officials will meet their Zambian counterparts with a view to conclude negotiations for clauses to start picking passengers in Zambia and Zimbabwe. The daily flights should be operational by end of May. RwandAir’s flights to Harare come as Ethiopian Airlines last week introduced flights between Addis Ababa and Harare. Reports also show that Kenya Airways plans to introduce three weekly flights between Nairobi and Victoria Falls by end of next month, while Airlink will later launch flights between Cape Town and Victoria Falls.

The agreement also provides the airline with purchase rights for 30 additional 737 MAXs. According to the US Department of Commerce, an aerospace sale of this magnitude creates or sustains approximately 18,000 jobs in the United States. Deliveries would be scheduled to start in 2022. Boeing negotiated the agreement under authorizations from the US government following a determination that Iran had met its obligations under the nuclear accord signed in 2015. Boeing will look to the Office of Foreign Assets Control for approval to perform under this transaction, a statement said. Boeing continues to follow the lead of the US government with regards to working with Iran’s airlines, and any and all contracts with Iran’s airlines are contingent upon US government approval, it added. – TradeArabia News Service Tags: Boeing | 737 MAX | More Travel, Tourism & Hospitality Stories Rixos Bab Al Bahr scoops four top awards Etihad backs Mumbai Indians for fourth consecutive year Boeing delivers 169 commercial jets in Q1 Boeing forms venture group for tech start-ups Marassi Al Bahrain introduces ‘Sunset Sessions’ The Oberoi Beach Resort, Al Zorah officially opens Dubai Duty Free wins double awards for CSR UK to host second B2B event for Muslim lifestyle sector ME carriers record strongest air travel demand growth New identity for Saraya Bandar Jissah Turkish Airlines offers enticing deals to Istanbul Etihad supports autism awareness Ultima Gstaad beckons Middle Eastern travellers Key dental forum to promote medical tourism in Bahrain Airbus launches interior services subsidiary Airbus wins top awards at Aircraft Interiors Expo Flydubai continues partnership with Recaro aircraft seating Airbus develops package of new A380 Cabin Enablers Final preparations underway for 'Bahrain For All' festival Recaro to supply Economy Class seats for Gulf Air's new fleet Plan a special getaway at Tilal Liwa Hotel Bahrain set for Heritage Festival New IntercityHotel signed in Oman Emirates introduces tablet loan service on US flights Oman Air to launch new daily flight to Manchester, UK Nakheel awards works deal for new Dragon City hotel Cayan Homes launches property promotions at Rotana hotel Emirates to offer double daily services to Bali Maldives ready to host international travel trade show Hotel Show Saudi Arabia opens Calendar of Events View all events Tools Exchange Rates Weather Forecast BBC World Service Ads Sectors | Information | About Us | Construction & Real Estate Energy, Oil & Gas Finance & Capital Market Industry & Logistics IT & Telecommunication Health & Environment Motoring Retail & Wholesale Travel, Tourism & Hospitality Government & Laws Media & Promotion Back to top Trade News Newsletter Events Business Directory TradeArabia Network Advertising Contact Feedback Privacy Statement Terms of Service Web Feeds

Boeing HorizonX has made a venture investment in Washington, DC-based Upskill, a provider of enterprise software for augmented reality wearables focused on enhancing productivity, quality and safety in manufacturing, field service and logistics. Boeing has been working with Upskill for more than two years to evaluate the use of its technology across multiple locations nationally. In addition, Boeing HorizonX is partnering with JetBlue Technology Ventures to invest in Zunum Aero, a Kirkland, Wash.-based company that is pursuing the development of alternative propulsion aircraft, with potential for performance and efficiency improvements in a range of aerospace applications. "Our ability to identify, shape and harness game-changing innovations wherever they are developed is key to sustaining and growing our leadership in aerospace," said Dennis Muilenburg, Boeing chairman, president and CEO. "Boeing HorizonX is tasked with ensuring we are fully engaged with opportunities from early-stage companies, market trends and emerging technologies while also fostering more rapid and effective internal innovation." Boeing HorizonX is led by Steve Nordlund, who takes this role after serving as vice president of strategy for Boeing Defense, Space & Security. Prior to his strategy role, Nordlund led Boeing's Autonomous Systems division. He has led strategy and business development organizations in both defense and commercial airplane business units at Boeing and helped launch venture-backed Insitu, which developed the ScanEagle and Integrator unmanned aerial systems. Boeing acquired Insitu in 2008. Boeing HorizonX will operate as part of the Corporate Development & Strategy group, which reports to Greg Smith, chief financial officer and executive vice president of Corporate Development & Strategy at Boeing, with alignment also to Boeing's chief technology officer and senior vice president of Boeing Engineering, Test & Technology, Greg Hyslop. In line with Boeing's plan for investing in future growth, Boeing HorizonX will have three focus areas: making targeted investments in new ventures and startups; seeking unique business opportunities for the company's aerospace technology; and assessing disruptive innovations and business strategies. "The Boeing HorizonX team will build on Boeing's advanced technology and depth of aerospace expertise in design, development and manufacturing while bringing in outside perspectives and leveraging the speed and agility of a wide range of companies and research organizations," Smith said. "As part of our company strategy to accelerate growth and productivity, we intend to be flexible and move quickly to identify technologies, business models and market opportunities that hold the promise of creating and delivering more value for our customers and other stakeholders." – TradeArabia News Service Tags: Boeing | More Travel, Tourism & Hospitality Stories Rixos Bab Al Bahr scoops four top awards Etihad backs Mumbai Indians for fourth consecutive year Iran airline inks deal for 30 Boeing jets Boeing delivers 169 commercial jets in Q1 Marassi Al Bahrain introduces ‘Sunset Sessions’ The Oberoi Beach Resort, Al Zorah officially opens Dubai Duty Free wins double awards for CSR UK to host second B2B event for Muslim lifestyle sector ME carriers record strongest air travel demand growth New identity for Saraya Bandar Jissah Turkish Airlines offers enticing deals to Istanbul Etihad supports autism awareness Ultima Gstaad beckons Middle Eastern travellers Key dental forum to promote medical tourism in Bahrain Airbus launches interior services subsidiary Airbus wins top awards at Aircraft Interiors Expo Flydubai continues partnership with Recaro aircraft seating Airbus develops package of new A380 Cabin Enablers Final preparations underway for 'Bahrain For All' festival Recaro to supply Economy Class seats for Gulf Air's new fleet Plan a special getaway at Tilal Liwa Hotel Bahrain set for Heritage Festival New IntercityHotel signed in Oman Emirates introduces tablet loan service on US flights Oman Air to launch new daily flight to Manchester, UK Nakheel awards works deal for new Dragon City hotel Cayan Homes launches property promotions at Rotana hotel Emirates to offer double daily services to Bali Maldives ready to host international travel trade show Hotel Show Saudi Arabia opens Calendar of Events View all events Tools Exchange Rates Weather Forecast BBC World Service Ads Sectors | Information | About Us | Construction & Real Estate Energy, Oil & Gas Finance & Capital Market Industry & Logistics IT & Telecommunication Health & Environment Motoring Retail & Wholesale Travel, Tourism & Hospitality Government & Laws Media & Promotion Back to top Trade News Newsletter Events Business Directory TradeArabia Network Advertising Contact Feedback Privacy Statement Terms of Service Web Feeds

Photo / File Airbus and Boeing now offer aircraft that appear capable of flying non-stop commercial flights from Sydney to London - the 'Holy Grail' for Australian carrier Qantas. As long as oil prices don't go much higher than around US$70 (NZ$100) per barrel, the 20-hour flight can be financially viable, and could be on schedules within five years, said aviation experts, speaking as Qantas gets ready to sell its first tickets for London to Perth direct. Airbus has increased the range of its A350-900ULR to 9,700 nautical miles (17,960kms) from the 8,700 nautical miles announced when it sold the plane to Singapore Airlines in 2015 for delivery next year, a spokesman told Reuters. Including headwinds, the Sydney-London flight is equivalent to 9,600 nautical miles. "These aircraft, we think, are potentially real goers on these routes," Qantas CEO Alan Joyce told Reuters of the A350-900ULR and the bigger but less advanced Boeing 777-8. "You know from what they have done on other aircraft that Sydney-London and Melbourne-London has real possibility." For Qantas, a non-stop Sydney-London route that cuts three hours off the flight time would allow it to charge a premium and differentiate its product from the around two dozen other airlines plying the so-called Kangaroo route with stop-offs in Singapore, Dubai and Hong Kong. The route accounts for only 13 per cent of Qantas' international capacity, but carries the prestige QF1 flight number and is important to its global brand. Qantas could charge around a 20 per cent price premium for a non-stop Sydney-London flight as it would attract business and premium leisure travellers wanting to complete the trip as fast as possible, said Rico Merkert, a professor specialising in transport at the University of Sydney's business school. Continued below. Related Content Which is the biggest airline of them all? Cases of severe turbulence to soar thanks to climate change, say scientists World's shortest international flight canned "It's something that can be presented as a unique selling point for Qantas," he said. Qantas begins non-stop flights from Perth to London next year, using the Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner. For this scheduled flight, tickets for which go on sale this month, the Dreamliner will have fewer seats than usual, will use the most advanced flight path modelling methods, and will reduce the weight in areas seemingly as minor as the dishes and forks. The Perth flight will take 17 hours - a far cry from the four days and seven stops it took when Qantas created the Kangaroo Route to London in 1947. Qantas can offset the higher cost of carrying more fuel to complete the flight by saving on stopover costs, such as airport charges, ground handling, taxes, crew hotel rooms and lounge usage. "In terms of economics, much depends on fuel prices," said Teal Group aerospace analyst Richard Aboulafia. "If they stay at US$50 (NZ$71) a barrel or less, it should be possible to keep costs reasonable. But as fuel goes up, the disadvantages of flying a very heavy plane begin to make ultra-long haul problematic." If the 787-9 can do Perth-London, we think that when the 777-8 comes out in the 2021 timeframe we will have a lot more improvement in technology. Dinesh Keskar, Boeing Senior Vice President Sales Asia-Pacific and India He said the flight should remain economic at prices below around US$70 (NZ$100) a barrel, though Leeham Co analyst Bjorn Fehrm said the actual level could be far higher as one-stop rivals would also be squeezed by higher oil prices. Singapore Airlines ended its New York and Los Angeles flights using the four-engined A340-500 in 2013 when oil prices topped US$107 (NZ$153) a barrel. The carrier is now waiting for delivery of the far more fuel-efficient twin-engined A350-900ULR next year. Qantas is pushing the planemakers hard on a stretch goal of completing the Sydney-London flight with 300 seats to give it the highest possible revenue and fleet flexibility. However, Fehrm said the aircraft would likely fall short of that goal if Qantas wanted to avoid a fuel stop on the westbound leg when headwinds are strongest. If such stopovers became frequent enough, Qantas would lose its ability to charge a premium on the route. Two aviation industry sources said the Airbus A350-900ULR would fit more than 250 passengers on the Sydney-London route, up from the 170 mainly business-class seats on Singapore Airlines' configuration for flights to New York and Los Angeles. The Kangaroo route is the most competitive on the globe. Alan Joyce, Qantas CEO Boeing's 777-8, due to enter service early in the next decade, could carry around 280 passengers on the westbound leg of the Sydney-London flight, the sources said. The sources declined to be named because the configuration details are not finalised. Airbus and Boeing declined to comment specifically on the seat count. "We think our airplane has the legs and the capability," said Dinesh Keskar, Boeing Senior Vice President Sales Asia-Pacific and India. 'If the 787-9 can do Perth-London, we think that when the 777-8 comes out in the 2021 timeframe we will have a lot more improvement in technology." Airbus, Boeing and engine manufacturers are constantly investing to reduce fuel usage, extending a plane's range and its ability to perform in hot conditions like the Middle East. That means the planemakers don't have to invest specifically for any Qantas order, the size of which is still unclear. Pushing the seat count towards 300 would also give Qantas the flexibility to use these aircraft on other long routes, such as a mooted Sydney-New York flight, as it looks to replace six ageing 747-400ER planes and eventually its fleet of 12 A380s. Qantas' Joyce has raised publicly the possibility of ordering the 777-8 for ultra-long haul flights for the last two years, but the A350-900ULR has entered the equation more recently. "It has added competition, and we would be crazy if we didn't do a competition at the right time,' Joyce said. 'That gets you the best pricing and ... the most capable aircraft." Qantas has yet to launch a formal tender process for the prestige order, as it waits for Boeing to finalise the specifications on the 777-8. But the first Sydney-London flights are possible around 2022, Joyce said. "The Kangaroo route is probably the most competitive on the globe," Joyce said. "(Flying non-stop) takes us off this superhighway of very competitive conditions of capacity which is priced, in many cases, under costs." - additional reporting Reuters. - Daily Mail Email Print Get the news delivered straight to your inbox Receive the day’s news, sport and entertainment in our daily email newsletter SIGN UP NOW Loading Currency Compare and convert world currencies.

The two aviation giants revealed this week that they are investing in a little-known company called Zunum Aero, a startup developing alternative propulsion aircraft.

Boeing and JetBlue have turned their sights to hybrid-electric planes. The two aviation giants revealed this week that they are investing in a little-known company called Zunum Aero , a startup developing alternative propulsion aircraft ZUNUM AERO  Zunum Aero is working to develop 'hybrid to electric;' craft that 'sip fuel only when they have to.' It’s hoped that this will make electric air travel more affordable, with frequent service across more than 5,000 regional and general aviation airports in the US. The firm claims these resources are currently underutilized. According to Zunum Aero, this means passengers traveling from regional airports in the Boston area to Washington Dc, for example, would reach their destination in half the time, and at half the fare. In heavily-trafficked routes, this could decrease travel time by 40 percent. And, in areas with less congestion, it could even drop door-to-door times 80 percent. The firm says hybrid-electric propulsion will also allow for an 80 percent drop in emissions – and eventually, as battery densities improve, emissions could drop to zero. The firm plans to have regional hybrid-electric aircraft ready by the early 2020s. At launch, they say this will cut travel time and reduce costs for flights around 700 miles. And, by 2030, this is expected to jump to 1,000-mile flights. Zunum Aero is developing hybrid-electric craft and the technology to create a regional electric air network, according to the firm. It’s hoped that this will make electric air travel more affordable, with frequent service across more than 5,000 regional and general aviation airports in the US. The firm claims these resources are currently underutilized. ‘The shift of the industry to large aircraft and long ranges driven by gas turbines has concentrated almost all air traffic to just two percent of our airports, creating a massive transport gap over regional distances where there is no high-speed alternative,’ said Ashish Kumar, CEO and founder of Zunum Aero. ‘As a result, door-to-door times for most journeys are no better than they were 50 years ago. ‘Hybrid propulsion is an industry-changing solution, enabling mid-sized aircraft on regional routes to have better cost efficiencies than airliners.’ RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next The flying taxi set for liftoff: 18 rotor Volocopter gets go...

Boeing, through its innovation cell Boeing Horizon X, and JetBlue Technology Ventures are now backing the startup. The Zunum team has been working with the FAA since 2014, and it’s hope that a set of standards will be in place for electric aircraft by 2018, with the first likely to certify in 2020. ‘Our goal is to be part of a disruptive force rather than the one being disrupted and we seek new technologies that look to change the game,’ said Bonny Simi, President, JetBlue Technology Ventures. ‘As a company that is also deeply committed to innovation in sustainable travel, we believe that Zunum and its quiet, environmentally-friendly aircraft will light up a vast network of underutilized airports and reinvent regional travel.’    Read more: Zunum Aero Share or comment on this article e-mail 22 shares Most watched News videos Girl in India found living with monkeys dubbed Mowgli 2.0 Girl found living with monkeys can't walk or talk like humans Sunrise news team tricked by crocodile garden ornament Uber passenger threatens to falsely accuse driver of rape Cute Chinese kid owns Little Big Shots stage with his Latin dance Couple caught getting frisky in university building Amazing parrot Einstein able to mimic human sounds and movements Disturbing footage of attempted child abduction in Philadelphia Kendall Jenner stars in Pepsi's 'Live for Now Moments Anthem' ad Driving tutor caught shouting and swearing at kids on horseback Shocking video shows effects of stomach acid mixed with coke Trump orders launch of 50 Tomahawk missiles on Syrian airbase 'Mowgli girl' who walks on all fours and does not speak...

Boeing is relocating to Legacy West at 121 and the Toll Road, specifically in the Legacy Urban Village which also includes apartments. Now, they won’t be building new 737s here. The company is actually opening up a new division of the business that includes global services. Boeing’s Division President Stan Deal said… “We have a fixed focus on serving our customers worldwide, and this location assists in our mission of providing uncompromising service worldwide.” Boeing is the fifth company to jump on the Plano bandwagon. Other big companies included in the 250 acre development are Toyota, FedEx, JPMorgan Chase, and Liberty Mutual Insurance. This is great news for the Texas economy, however, you can probably expect a lot more traffic and future highway construction. Comments Leave a Reply Cancel reply Enter your comment here...

Posted 07 Apr 2017 01:55 Updated 07 Apr 2017 03:30 The logo of Airbus is pictured at the entrance of the Airbus facility in Bouguenais, near Nantes, France March 20, 2017. REUTERS/Stephane Mahe Enlarge Caption  Email More A A PARIS: Airbus took 20 new jet orders in March to end the first quarter well behind rival Boeing as delays in deliveries of the A320neo shifted the spotlight back to an earlier model. The France-based company ended the quarter with 26 orders, but the net total for the year shrank to six after allowing for cancellations and conversions between different models. Boeing earlier posted 226 jetliner orders for the same quarter, boosted by orders for 21 airframes for its P-8 military surveillance jet project and 15 U.S. air refuelling tankers. After cancellations, Boeing posted 198 net orders including those military derivatives, but most of the remaining orders were from airlines that have to be identified. Airbus took 18 orders for its popular A320 single-aisle jet, despite it nearing the end of its production as Airbus switches to the upgraded A320neo, whose deliveries have been delayed by problems at one engine supplier, Pratt & Whitney . The order tally for A320neo aircraft fell by 8 units in March: hardly enough to dent a backlog of over 3,500 orders but enough to highlight the unexpected extra availability of current-generation A320s as Airbus keeps assembly lines flowing. Chinese lessor CALC and U.S. budget carrier Spirit Airlines are among customers seizing the chance to pick up extra A320s powered by an earlier generation of engines at what some industry sources describe as "opportunistic" prices. Airbus delivered 12 A320neos in March to bring the 2017 total to 26, but deliveries remain behind schedule due mainly to problems with engines from Pratt, one of two suppliers. Airbus aims to deliver about 200 A320neos this year. In two other widely watched projects it delivered 13 A350s and 3 A380s in the first quarter. In total, it delivered 136 jets in the quarter compared with Boeing's total of 169. However, analysts said Boeing's deliveries were lower than expected and Wells Fargo Securities cut its earnings forecast for the quarter, while maintaining its forecast for the year. Boeing shares rose 0.4 percent, about in line with the U.S. market, while Airbus shares rose more than 1 percent. Boeing overtook its European rival as the world's largest jetliner producer in 2012 and analysts say it is expected to retain the title through the rest of the decade, while the prize for most orders is hotly contested each year. Last quarter's wide order gap with Boeing came as Airbus faces a UK probe into suspected corruption in its use of third-party agents to win contracts in at least five countries, which widened this month as France started its own investigation. Airbus said in its annual report released ahead of an April 12 shareholder meeting it was reviewing processes for using such agents, most of which have seen their relationships with Airbus canceled as the company carries out a compliance drive.

(Reuters) SEATTLE: Boeing said on Wednesday it had launched a venture capital arm and invested in two tech startups, a fresh sign of the importance big companies see in keeping up with rapidly evolving technology for designing and making products. Boeing’s new division, known as HorizonX, invested in Upskill, a Washington-based software company that uses Google Glass-type eye wear to help assembly workers with complex tasks such as creating wiring bundles for Boeing jetliners. It also invested in Zunum Aero, a Seattle-area company that is working on electric-hybrid aircraft aimed at bringing down the cost of flying to regional airports. Zunum also received funding from JetBlue Technology Ventures, a unit of the New York-based JetBlue Airways Corp. Boeing and JetBlue are not alone in taking stakes in promising technology companies. General Electric’s venture arm invested in an earlier Upskill funding round, and Airbus has had a venture fund since 2014. Boeing is not aiming to profit from the ventures directly but instead to access technology used in autonomous vehicles, machine learning, additive manufacturing and wearable devices, said Steve Nordlund, a Boeing vice president who heads HorizonX. “These are all starting to converge and have the potential to fundamentally change how we operate inside and outside of companies,” he said. Upskill’s software platform for example, brings data typically stored in books into workers’ tools. The system can be used in manufacturing, field service and shipping and warehouse logistics, and the company’s revenue growth is in triple digits annually, said Brian Ballard, chief executive officer. “Imagine working on a car and not having to flip through the paper manual,” Ballard said. Typical systems pay back in a few months. Upskill has been working with Boeing for two years and has moved beyond pilot tests into production. Boeing declined to specify investment amounts, “but this initiative represents a multi-year commitment by Boeing to spend tens of millions of dollars a year to advance innovation and to supplement our research and development efforts,” said spokesman Chaz Bickers. Nordlund was formerly vice president of strategy for Boeing’s defense, space and security business and was involved in launching drone-maker Insitu Inc, which Boeing acquired in 2008. He also has worked in sales at IBM and was chief information officer at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University.

He also has worked in sales at IBM and was chief information officer at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University. Comments View the discussion thread.

The FSS, made by TRU Simulation & Training, was certified to FAA Level C standard. Pilots can start training on an interim level C simulator. The qualification level will be upgraded to the level D standard once all final aircraft data is available, a TRU spokesperson told ATW.  TRU has also delivered the first of several Boeing 737 MAX FFSs and a fixed flat panel training classroom to Boeing’s Miami training center. The delivery is part of a 10-year exclusive agreement between Boeing and TRU signed in 2014 to provide multiple 737 MAX flight-training suites to Boeing’s training campuses worldwide. Training on the devices will begin this year. Additional 737 MAX FFSs will be deployed at Boeing training centers in Shanghai, Singapore and at London-Gatwick, in the UK. The MAX narrowbody is scheduled to begin service with Dallas-based Southwest Airlines in mid-2017. In March, Boeing placed an order with TRU for two 777-9 FFS devices, as part of a 10-year agreement between the companies announced in April 2016 for multiple 777X FFS devices and flat-panel classroom trainers. The first 777X training suite is expected to be ready for training in 2019-2020, ahead of the aircraft’s entry into service, planned for 2020.

The France-based company ended the quarter with 26 orders, but the net total for the year shrank to six after allowing for cancellations and conversions between different models. Boeing earlier posted 226 jetliner orders for the same quarter, boosted by orders for 21 airframes for its P-8 military surveillance jet project and 15 U.S. air refuelling tankers. After cancellations, Boeing posted 198 net orders including those military derivatives, but most of the remaining orders were from airlines that have to be identified. Airbus took 18 orders for its popular A320 single-aisle jet, despite it nearing the end of its production as Airbus switches to the upgraded A320neo, whose deliveries have been delayed by problems at one engine supplier, Pratt &amp; Whitney. The order tally for A320neo aircraft fell by 8 units in March: hardly enough to dent a backlog of over 3,500 orders but enough to highlight the unexpected extra availability of current-generation A320s as Airbus keeps assembly lines flowing. Chinese lessor CALC and U.S. budget carrier Spirit Airlines are among customers seizing the chance to pick up extra A320s powered by an earlier generation of engines at what some industry sources describe as "opportunistic" prices. Airbus delivered 12 A320neos in March to bring the 2017 total to 26, but deliveries remain behind schedule due mainly to problems with engines from Pratt, one of two suppliers. Airbus aims to deliver about 200 A320neos this year. In two other widely watched projects it delivered 13 A350s and 3 A380s in the first quarter. In total, it delivered 136 jets in the quarter compared with Boeing's total of 169. However, analysts said Boeing's deliveries were lower than expected and Wells Fargo Securities cut its earnings forecast for the quarter, while maintaining its forecast for the year. Boeing shares rose 0.4 percent, about in line with the U.S. market, while Airbus shares rose more than 1 percent. Boeing overtook its European rival as the world's largest jetliner producer in 2012 and analysts say it is expected to retain the title through the rest of the decade, while the prize for most orders is hotly contested each year. Last quarter's wide order gap with Boeing came as Airbus faces a UK probe into suspected corruption in its use of third-party agents to win contracts in at least five countries, which widened this month as France started its own investigation. Airbus said in its annual report released ahead of an April 12 shareholder meeting it was reviewing processes for using such agents, most of which have seen their relationships with Airbus cancelled as the company carries out a compliance drive.

Greg Smith said: “The Boeing HorizonX team will build on Boeing’s advanced technology and depth of aerospace expertise in design, development and manufacturing while bringing in outside perspectives and leveraging the speed and agility of a wide range of companies and research organisations. “As part of our company strategy to accelerate growth and productivity, we intend to be flexible and move quickly to identify technologies, business models and market opportunities that hold the promise of creating and delivering more value for our customers and other stakeholders.” Boeing chairman, president and CEO Dennis Muilenburg said: “Our ability to identify, shape and harness game-changing innovations wherever they are developed is key to sustaining and growing our leadership in aerospace. “Boeing HorizonX is tasked with ensuring we are fully engaged with opportunities from early-stage companies, market trends and emerging technologies while also fostering more rapid and effective internal innovation.” The venture arm of Boeing has also invested in two technology start-up companies Upskill and Zunum Aero. Upskill is a Washington DC-based start-up developing augmented reality (AR) wearables to increase productivity, quality and safety in manufacturing, field services and logistics. Boeing was associated with Upskill for over two years now and has been evaluating the application of its technology across several locations. The company has developed Skylight, an industrial AR application platform for smartglasses that can increase productivity, efficiency and can reduce error significantly. Skylight can be integrated with an organisation’s existing ERP, MES, WHS or CRM. The wearables work by providing workers with access to data about their work, within their line of sight. They can connect with workers both at facilities and at remote locations. Zunum Aero is a Kirkland, Washington-based start-up developing affordable hybrid-electric aircrafts and plans to introduce them by early 2020s. Boeing HorizonX along with JetBlue Technology Ventures has invested in this company. Zunum Aero plans to develop smaller 10-50 seat aircrafts are poised to reduce the cost of air travel for travellers and can also help in putting more than 5000 of the underutilised regional aviation airports across the US to use.

Trump will be working, but the trips run up a pricey tab paid for by taxpayers.  As Politico  estimated earlier this month, Trump's first trip down to Mar-a-Lago likely cost around $3 million.  That estimate is based off the cost of a similar trip former President Obama took to Florida in 2013.  Visits to Mar-a-Lago and some of Trump's other favorite properties could cost taxpayers "hundreds of millions of dollars" over the next four years, according to a report from  The Washington Post  on Thursday. The Obama family's travel expenses during their eight years in the White House cost just shy of $97 million, according to conservative watchdog Judicial Watch.  The  Palm Beach Post  reported earlier this week Trump's visits to his estate since he won the election have cost the local sheriff's office $1.5 million in overtime pay. Local officials are hoping for federal reimbursement. This despite his repeated criticisms of the Obama family's travels. "He plays more golf than the guys on the PGA Tour play," Trump said of Obama in February 2016.

So when Donald Jr. and Eric Trump travel around the globe for business, they're accompanied by Secret Service agents.  This weekend, the two  will be in Dubai  for the opening of  Trump International Golf Club, Dubai . Taxpayers will likely foot the bill for Secret Service hotel rooms,  just as they did  when Eric Trump traveled to Uruguay on business last month. The Washington Post  reported the hotel room bill for that trip was close to six figures. And since Trump hasn't divested himself from his businesses, he and his family stand to financially benefit from those taxpayer-supported trips. The tab also keeps running as first lady Melania Trump and the couple's son Barron live in New York City. Trump  has said  they'll move into the White House once Barron wraps up the school year.  Until then, it costs New York City an estimated  $500,000 per day  to protect their home in a high-traffic area in the city.  The city sought a $35 million reimbursement from Congress for security it provided around Trump Tower from Election Day to Inauguration Day. Instead, Congress reimbursed the city for $7 million, according to  The Wall Street Journal . Additionally, the Secret Service was previously looking  to rent  space in Trump Tower. The military is also  reportedly considering  renting space for the nuclear football for when the president is at his New York residence. Again, that too would cost taxpayers — and go to a Trump business.

The France-based company ended the quarter with 26 orders, but the net total for the year shrank to six after allowing for cancellations and conversions between different models. Boeing earlier posted 226 jetliner orders for the same quarter, boosted by orders for 21 airframes for its P-8 military surveillance jet project and 15 U.S. air refuelling tankers. After cancellations, Boeing posted 198 net orders including those military derivatives, but most of the remaining orders were from airlines that have to be identified. Airbus took 18 orders for its popular A320 single-aisle jet, despite it nearing the end of its production as Airbus switches to the upgraded A320neo, whose deliveries have been delayed by problems at one engine supplier, Pratt & Whitney <UTX.N>. The order tally for A320neo aircraft fell by 8 units in March: hardly enough to dent a backlog of over 3,500 orders but enough to highlight the unexpected extra availability of current-generation A320s as Airbus keeps assembly lines flowing. Chinese lessor CALC and U.S. budget carrier Spirit Airlines are among customers seizing the chance to pick up extra A320s powered by an earlier generation of engines at what some industry sources describe as "opportunistic" prices. Airbus delivered 12 A320neos in March to bring the 2017 total to 26, but deliveries remain behind schedule due mainly to problems with engines from Pratt, one of two suppliers. Airbus aims to deliver about 200 A320neos this year. In two other widely watched projects it delivered 13 A350s and 3 A380s in the first quarter. In total, it delivered 136 jets in the quarter compared with Boeing's total of 169. However, analysts said Boeing's deliveries were lower than expected and Wells Fargo Securities cut its earnings forecast for the quarter, while maintaining its forecast for the year. Boeing shares rose 0.4 percent, about in line with the U.S. market, while Airbus shares rose more than 1 percent. Boeing overtook its European rival as the world's largest jetliner producer in 2012 and analysts say it is expected to retain the title through the rest of the decade, while the prize for most orders is hotly contested each year. Last quarter's wide order gap with Boeing came as Airbus faces a UK probe into suspected corruption in its use of third-party agents to win contracts in at least five countries, which widened this month as France started its own investigation. Airbus said in its annual report released ahead of an April 12 shareholder meeting it was reviewing processes for using such agents, most of which have seen their relationships with Airbus canceled as the company carries out a compliance drive.

By Doug G. Ware   |   April 6, 2017 at 2:25 PM Follow @upi Comments April 6 (UPI) -- Two of the biggest names in the sky -- Boeing and JetBlue -- are investing in Zunum Aero, a Seattle-based firm that is developing small electric aircraft it says will increase short-haul commercial flight efficiency, reduce fare prices and start the era of green air travel within the next decade. The innovation and venture branches of The Boeing Company and JetBlue Airways announced investments in the startup Wednesday. "Our ability to identify, shape and harness game-changing innovations wherever they are developed is key to sustaining and growing our leadership in aerospace," Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg said in a statement. RECOMMENDEDBoeing awarded contract to build 17 Poseidon aircraft The newly created "innovation cell" of the Chicago-based aerospace giant, Boeing HorizonX, will seek to support new and emerging technologies. "Boeing HorizonX is tasked with ensuring we are fully engaged with opportunities from early-stage companies, market trends and emerging technologies, while also fostering more rapid and effective internal innovation," Muilenburg added. JetBlue Technology Ventures, a similar tech spinoff of the popular airline, is joining Boeing in the endeavor, which it calls "a game-changer" in the future of air travel. Zunum Aero aims to revolutionize passenger flight with the creation of both hybrid and fully electric aircraft -- which it says will initially have flight ranges of up to 700 miles. Its planes will fly into 5,000 U.S. regional airports and streamlined security will allow passengers to board them in minutes, the company says. The goal is to have the smaller, environmentally friendly planes in the sky -- with paying passengers -- by the early 2020s. #Boeing partners with @JetBlueVentures to invest in hybrid-electric aircraft company @zunumaero, learn more: https://t.co/UfkYEpThfQ pic.twitter.com/2iqzN9iG0K— The Boeing Company (@Boeing) April 5, 2017 "We are dreamers, engineers and pilots primarily based in Washington, and with partners across the country," the company says on its website. "We are over 3 years into our journey toward democratizing access to high-speed travel. We are passionate about high-speed connectivity to every community and neighborhood, so you can live where you like, get anywhere fast, and leave behind a healthy planet." Washington state has a long history with the aviation industry. For decades, Boeing developed its flagship aircraft, including the 747, and was headquartered in suburban Seattle. It maintains an operations facility in the city, but its main production and development operations are now located in the Midwest and East Coast. Wednesday, Washington Gov. Jay Inslee hailed the announcement, saying Zunum "is writing the next chapter of Washington's innovative aerospace story." Boeing HorizonX says it will have three main focuses: investing in new ventures, seeking unique business opportunities and assessing "disruptive innovations and strategies." "The Boeing HorizonX team will build on Boeing's advanced technology and depth of aerospace expertise in design, development and manufacturing while bringing in outside perspectives and leveraging the speed and agility of a wide range of companies and research organizations," Boeing's executive vice president for development and strategy, Greg Smith, said. "As part of our company strategy to accelerate growth and productivity, we intend to be flexible and move quickly to identify technologies, business models and market opportunities that hold the promise of creating and delivering more value for our customers and other stakeholders." RECOMMENDEDBoeing's latest Dreamliner model, the 787-10, makes maiden flight "JetBlue Technology Ventures incubates, invests in and partners with early stage startups at the intersection of technology, travel and hospitality," JetBlue Technology Ventures states on its website. In its announcement Wednesday, Boeing HorizonX also announced an investment in software-maker Upskill, for "augmented reality wearables focused on enhancing productivity, quality and safety in manufacturing, field service and logistics." Boeing, which last week successfully completed the first flight of its more environmentally friendly 787-10 Dreamliner, said it's been working with Washington, D.C.-based Upskill for more than two years to evaluate the use of its technologies.

After cancellations, Boeing posted 198 net orders including the P-8s for Australia, Britain, India and the United States but most of the remaining orders were from airlines that have to be identified. Airbus took 18 orders for its popular A320 single-aisle jet, despite it nearing the end of its production as Airbus switches to the upgraded A320neo, whose deliveries have been delayed by problems at one engine supplier, Pratt & Whitney. The order tally for A320neo aircraft fell by 8 units in March: hardly enough to dent a backlog of over 3,500 orders but enough to highlight the unexpected extra availability of current-generation A320s as Airbus keeps assembly lines flowing. Chinese lessor CALC and U.S. budget carrier Spirit Airlines are among customers seizing the chance to pick up extra A320s powered by an earlier generation of engines at what some industry sources describe as “opportunistic” prices. For the second month in a row, Airbus delivered 12 A320neos in March to bring the total for the year to 26, but deliveries remain behind schedule due mainly to technical and production problems with engines from Pratt, one of two suppliers. Airbus aims to deliver about 200 A320neos this year. Airbus delivered 13 A350s and 3 A380s in the first quarter. It delivered a total of 136 jets compared with Boeing’s total of 169. Boeing overtook its European rival as the world’s largest jetliner producer in 2012 and analysts say it is expected to retain the title through the rest of the decade, while the prize for most orders is hotly contested each year.

Adient employs over 75,000 people across 230 manufacturing sites worldwide and performs work for all major manufacturers in its sector, covering more than 25 million vehicles annually. “There are a lot of things that the seating market for aircraft has been lacking, so [we would like] to see what they can create for aircraft seating. It’s all about creating more choice and value,” Boeing Commercial Airplanes seat/IFEC team director Alan Wittman told a small media gathering at the Aircraft Interiors Expo (AIX) in Hamburg. Wittman said Adient is working quickly, but it is too soon to say which aircraft types or cabin class they will target, or when their initial designs might go public. “They are a large and capable company, so they are looking at the whole market. This is where the collaboration comes in. They are relying on us to teach them how the [aviation] industry works from a certification and technical perspective,” he said. Adient chairman and CEO Bruce McDonald said his company is keen to leverage the expertise it has built up in the automotive industry in other mobility markets. “Through discussions with Boeing, we believe there’s an opportunity for Adient to raise the bar on the aviation passenger experience, building on our leadership in the automobile seat market,” McDonald said. In 2016, Boeing’s seating suppliers achieved a record performance, with 10 months of on-time deliveries to its factories, but Wittman said issues still remain. Two weeks ago, in mid-March, Boeing held its third annual seating symposium, assembling all its suppliers in Seattle to discuss design and build quality expectations. “In the seating world, this has been a challenge. There has been a big focus on design and build quality. It has been a lot of hard work for suppliers and for us, internally, to meet our production rates,” Wittman said. “We have been working with new companies, developing new relationships over the last three or four years. These companies are producing products for line fit. We are really happy with their performance and partnership. We have put a lot of energy into developing new suppliers.” At AIX 2017, Boeing also announced a 787 economy seating partnership with LIFT by EnCore, building on the 737 seating partnership that was unveiled between the two companies at last year’s Expo. Boeing has also teamed up with Jamco on two business class seats, Journey-B and Venture, for the 787, set for 2018 entry into service. “Jamco have really grown their seat business over the last few years; they have got a lot of capability,” Wittman said, adding that the two new Jamco designs should be in the Boeing catalogue by June.

By James Billington Updated April 6, 2017 21:16 BST Qantas claims non-stop 20-hour flights from London to Sydney a possibility by 2022.Reuters Qantas airlines has claimed the 'holy grail of flights' – a non-stop trip from London to Sydney – will be doable within five years. The 20-hour, super long haul, flight is said to be a realistic possibility thanks to advances in aviation technology and efficiency. Advances in plane design and materials from Boeing and Airbus have seen aircraft with the ability to fly further in recent years and Qantas is already set to introduce the first ever non-stop London to Perth route in 2018. This 17-hour flight will be executed using Boeing's 787-9 Dreamliner plane – a revolutionary craft made from lightweight composite rather than aluminium for increased fuel efficiency. "If the 787-9 can do Perth-London, we think that when the 777-8 comes out in the 2021 timeframe we will have a lot more improvement in technology," said Dinesh Keskar, Boeing Senior Vice President of sales Asia-Pacific and India. "You know from what they have done on other aircraft that Sydney-London and Melbourne-London has real possibility," said Alan Joyce, Qantas chief executive. "These aircraft, we think, are potentially real goers on these routes." The current London to Sydney route, which is otherwise known as the 'Kangaroo route' as a result of its one-stop hop in destinations such as Dubai or Singapore, is a highly regarded and highly valued flight by the Australian national carrier. However, it's also one of the busiest, most competitive long haul routes in the world. To be able to do the trip in one go without the need to stop would not only be financially attractive fuel-wise, but it would also see the company be able to charge a premium fare, which could be anywhere up to 20% more it has been said, for those passengers wanting to do without the inconvenience. "It takes us off this superhighway of very competitive conditions of capacity which is priced, in many cases, under costs," said Joyce. If the flight were to come into operation it would be the world's longest passenger flight, overtaking the current longest flight from Auckland to Dubai clocked at 17 hours and 15 minutes by Emirates Airlines. While the non-stop flight would cut down travelling time by many hours (depending on your layover) the prospect of a 20-hour jaunt without a break might sound like an economy passenger's worst nightmare. Hypersonic aircraft that can complete the journey from London to Sydney in just two hours may be in development but we're a long, long way off till this next-generation of air travel.

Idaho Business Health Nation World Elections Photos Business Norwegian launches Seattle-London flights with $199 one-way fares UPDATED: Thu., April 6, 2017, 6 p.m. By Dominic Gates Seattle Times Twitter Facebook  Email  Reddit  SMS Low-cost airline Norwegian will open a nonstop Seattle-London route from September with one-way economy class fares – including taxes but excluding fees for checking baggage and meals – starting at $199. The lowest fare that includes seat selection, checked luggage and meals is $289 one way. The airline will fly Boeing’s widebody 787 Dreamliner on the route between Seattle and Gatwick Airport. The service starts on Sept. 17, but tickets are available at Norwegian.com/us, with the dates for the lowest fares listed on the airline’s fare calendar. Norwegian will have four flights per week – departing Seattle on Mondays, Wednesday, Fridays and Sundays. Anders Lindstrvm, Norwegian’s U.S. director of communications, said a limited number of seats will be available at $199 one way, with the second-lowest ongoing fare set at $219 one way (also without checked baggage or meals). The news comes 10 days after Virgin Atlantic began nonstop 787 service between Seattle and London Heathrow Airport, replacing Delta’s flight on that route. British Airways also flies nonstop to Heathrow from Seattle. Other airline fares The lowest economy-class fares on Virgin and British in September are more than $1,000 round trip, including checked baggage and meals. Norwegian will also offer premium-class seats that include priority boarding, “sleeper seats” and meals and drinks for $839 one way, including taxes. The sleeper seats are not “lie-flat” seats as in business class on British or Virgin. Instead, they recline to about 45 degrees and offer 46 inches of legroom with support under the legs, offering comfort beyond premium economy but short of an international business-class seat. Fares for premium economy on Virgin and British in September start at about $1,600 round trip, while business class starts at about $4,000. Norwegian has been expanding rapidly in the U.S. It flies 787s across the Atlantic from Boston, New York, Fort Lauderdale, Orlando, Los Angeles and San Francisco into London, Paris and Barcelona, Spain. In September, it will also start nonstop 787 service between London and Denver. Beginning in June, it will begin flying the new Boeing narrowbody 737 MAX between various smaller airports on the U.S. East Coast and Belfast, Dublin and Cork in Ireland, Edinburgh in Scotland and Bergen, Norway. Introductory fares for those flights start at $69 one way. “Our nonstop routes from the U.S. to London, Paris and Barcelona are all doing phenomenally,” Lindstrvm said. “We will continue to expand with more routes, and open new European gateways in the near future.” He added that “with today’s route announcement, we surpass all the American airlines in terms of nonstop routes from the U.S. to London . Yet we still see the demand for many, many more flights to London (and) to many other cities across Europe.” Norwegian’s growth, fueled by debt it uses to buy new Boeing airplanes, has brought fierce opposition from large U.S. airlines and labor groups, which accuse the carrier of paying lower wages to pilots and cabin staff. Despite protests from American, Delta and United, the U.S. Department of Transportation in December granted Norwegian a long-delayed permit that will enable further expansion. The airline’s chief executive, Bjorn Kjos, denies the low-wage charge, insisting that he pays the going rate to U.S. crews. Kjos says his new long-haul, low-cost model will expand transatlantic travel significantly and create thousands of aviation jobs.

Evaluating Aerospace Manufacturing Hubs Boeing reported it will locate the headquarters of its new Global Services business unit in Plano, Texas. The company expects the facility to be operational in July. Boeing Global Services headquarters, situated 20.3 miles northeast of Dallas, will be located in the Legacy West mixed-use development in West Plano. According to the company, Global Services President & CEO Stan Deal, several of his leadership team members and some support staff will be located at the site, which will serve as a central hub for approximately 20,000 employees located around the globe. "We are excited to establish the Global Services headquarters in Plano," said Deal. "We have a fixed focus on serving our customers worldwide, and this location assists in our mission of providing uncompromising service worldwide." Boeing officials said the company selected the greater Dallas area because it's centrally located within Boeing's U.S. footprint, has good proximity to major operations for commercial customers and defense partners, and serves as a transportation hub that will allow the company to reach customers quickly and efficiently. "Texas continues to be a global powerhouse in business expansion and relocation because of our economic policies that encourage industry leaders, like Boeing, to expand their operations here," said Governor Greg Abbott. "As governor, I will continue to promote a low-tax and reasonable regulatory environment that removes barriers to entry and provides certainty for developing industries. I am proud to welcome Boeing's new Global Services unit to Texas and look forward to working with them further to continue their expansion in the Lone Star State, “ he added. "On behalf of the city of Plano, we are thrilled to welcome an iconic 100-year- innovative company like Boeing," said Plano Mayor Harry LaRosiliere. "Through the partnership with our city and the many amenities of Legacy West, we look forward to helping Boeing Global Services deliver on its mission."

Clyde Prestowitz April 6, 2017 During the campaign, Trump made a lot of promises to balance U.S. trade with China.

As China’s President Xi Jinping visits President Donald Trump at his winter White House in Mar-a-Lago on Thursday and Friday, we may see some of the true mettle of the new U.S. leader. During the election campaign, he proclaimed that he would create American jobs and raise wages by quickly turning around the massive $380 billion U.S. annual trade deficit with China. He charged that China was manipulating its currency to keep it undervalued versus the dollar, thereby artificially maintaining low prices for Chinese exports to the U.S. market. He said that “on day one” of his new administration, he would formally declare China a currency manipulator and take action domestically and within the International Monetary Fund to stop the manipulation and to achieve fair market currency values. He also said that he would impose tariffs as high as 45 percent on U.S. imports of Chinese goods and services in an effort to halt unfair trade and to correct the burgeoning U.S. trade deficit. So far, however, none of this has occurred. Trump has not yet declared China a currency manipulator. Here his task has been complicated by the fact that while China is indeed actively controlling the exchange rate of its currency, it is presently controlling it in a way that is raising rather than lowering the value of the Chinese yuan versus the U.S. dollar—making U.S. exports cheaper and imports from China more expensive. But nor has Trump announced the imposition of any tariffs on Chinese imports or any support for U.S. exports to China or elsewhere. All of which raises the question of what exactly Trump or any president can actually do to change the nature of the U.S.-China economic relationship. Let’s keep in mind that America’s relationship with China is a very broad, multifaceted phenomenon. It may feel good to say that America will just slap a 45 percent tariff on imports from China. But can America actually do that? Not without some proof of Chinese subsidies or other infractions of trade rules, and not without going through the procedures of the World Trade Organization, of which both the United States and China are members, and not without going through domestic investigatory and adjudication procedures within the U.S. government and with the International Trade Commission. But let’s suppose, that you are Trump and you don’t care about these niceties. You are just going to give Xi a piece of your mind and let the chips fall where they may. Ah, except there is this little problem with North Korea. It has been launching missiles and testing nuclear weapons. It will soon have, if it does not already, the capacity to hit the west coast of the United States with a nuclear bomb. It could obliterate much of South Korea, which you the president are committed by treaty to defend. The same is true of Japan. The only country with any apparent influence over North Korea is China. So you could really use some help from Xi to deal with these pesky North Koreans. But how much help do you think he’ll want to give after you tell him you’re slapping him with a 45 percent tariff? Or look at another conundrum. China is the biggest market in the world for Boeing airliners exported from America. But Boeing has a big competitor in the form of the European Airbus. So, if you slap a tariff on Xi, is he going to shift orders from Boeing to Airbus? How many jobs will that cost in the Seattle area and in South Carolina where Boeing manufactures? Or think about that iPhone with which you tweet. It can’t be made in the United States. Just think. If you slap a tariff on it, you might have to give up tweeting. There must be a better way. Right? Yes, there is, but it won’t be quick or easy, and it will require you, the president, to reverse a couple generations of American economic doctrine and foreign policy orthodoxy. Since the end of World War II, the United States has assumed that it would automatically be the world’s richest, most productive, most technologically advanced economy with the highest standard of living by dint of being an open-market, free-trade system. Thus, the primary focus of U.S. foreign policy has been to maintain global geopolitical dominance by allying with and protecting countries in Western Europe and in East Asia. Indeed, in Asia, the United States does not even have reciprocal alliances. It has unilaterally committed itself to defend South Korea, Japan, and the Philippines. A large part of U.S. policy has been to assist the economic development of these countries by encouraging them to develop export industries and to export to the open American market while keeping their own markets relatively closed to U.S. exports and even in many cases to U.S. investment. And while the United States does not protect China militarily, it has promoted China’s economic and technological development by agreeing to lopsided trade and investment arrangements on the basis of the theory that globalization is Americanization and that by dint of trade and economic development, China will become more liberal, democratic, friendly toward America, and a pillar of the global economic/political system. Because that assumption now appears to be seriously flawed, and a more nuanced and more realistic policy is necessary. On the one hand, Trump would be well advised to achieve an overall geopolitical modus vivendi with Xi’s China. The existential interests of the two countries are not opposed. They do not desire to conquer or rule over each other. They do not share borders and neither desires conflict with the other. If an agreement of some kind could be reached between Trump and Xi for the two sides to co-exist in an orderly way in the South China Sea where their forces face each other, a great contribution to the future peace and prosperity of both would be made. At the same time, the economic doctrines of the two are quite opposite. China’s is a state-guided, authoritarian, and partly state-owned economy that limits market access, limits foreign investment, compels technology transfer as a condition of market access, aims to achieve full employment and growth by accumulating trade surpluses, and actively seeks to surpass the United States industrially and technologically. The United States should not have to react in a hostile way, but it should react reciprocally. It should apply market-access conditions, investment guidance and control, anti-dumping, and other trade measures essentially to mirror or offset Chinese measures. Beyond this, the United States should also resolve to restructure its economy to have essentially balanced trade over the long term. This doesn’t mean that trade has to be balanced every year, but it has to be roughly in balance over a number of years. Otherwise, America will continue to accumulate foreign debt while gradually eroding its wealth-producing capacity. Such balanced trade could be achieved by the imposition of charge (call it a market access charge—MAC) on all foreign capital flowing into the United States. This charge could be adjusted to be high when the U.S. trade deficit is high and low when it is low. The proceeds could be used to make massive infrastructure investment that would provide jobs and advanced infrastructure for Americans for decades to come. The U.S. corporate tax system and income tax should also be altered so as to encourage saving and investment while dampening excess consumption. A proposal for taxing corporate cash flows arising from imports and exempting from tax those cash flows that arise from exports is currently making the rounds of consideration in Congress. This so-called Border Adjustment Tax is, in principle, a good idea and should be actively pursued. Finally, the United States must consider actively countering any future currency manipulation by engaging in counter-manipulation by buying the currencies of those countries trying to artificially reduce their currency values by selling them for dollars. A combination of these policies would assure long-term balance in U.S. trade with better employment and earnings potential. Is Trump capable of these nuanced policies? We’ll soon find out.

Qantas said that the super long-haul flights could be made possible thanks to Airbus’ new A350-900ULR and Boeing’s 777-8. These aircraft, we think, are potentially real goers on these routes," Alan Joyce, the chief executive of Qantas, told Reuters.

The company has yet to launch a formal tender process to place an order on the brand new planes, but Mr Joyce said the first flights could being around 2022.

It would also allow Qantas to charge a premium of about 20 per cent as its product would set it apart from  rival airlines operating on the route attracting business and holiday travellers wanting to complete the trip as fast as possible. "It's something that can be presented as a unique selling point for Qantas," Mr Joyce said.  Travel Photo of the Year: The winning entries 8 show all Travel Photo of the Year: The winning entries 1/8 Winners: Landscape category - Jurassic Coast (Dorset, UK) by Tony Cowburn Tony Cowburn 2/8 Winner: Icon category - Tiger's Nest (Paro Valley, Bhutan) by Kasia Nowak Kasia Nowak 3/8 Winner: People category - Reflections (S-21 Prison, Phnom Penh, Cambodia) by Charlotte Currie Charlotte Currie 4/8 Winner: Wildlife category - Escape!

Announcing the new service in December last year, Mr Joyce said the 17-hour flights would be the third-longest passenger flights in the world. However, it is still a much better option compared to the four days and seven stops it took when Qantas created the Kangaroo Route to London in 1947.

Qantas can offset the higher cost of carrying more fuel to complete the flight by saving on stopover costs. Published: 13:21 April 6, 2017 Reuters   SMALL MEDIUM LARGE Sydney: Both Airbus and Boeing now offer aircraft that appear capable of flying non-stop commercial flights from Sydney to London — the “Holy Grail” for Australian carrier Qantas Airways Ltd. As long as oil prices don’t go much higher than around $70 (Dh256.90) per barrel, the 20-hour flight can be financially viable, and could be on schedules within five years, aviation experts say. Airbus has increased the range of its A350-900ULR to 9,700 nautical miles (17,960 kilometres) from the 8,700 nautical miles announced when it sold the plane to Singapore Airlines in 2015 for delivery next year, a spokesman said. Including headwinds, the Sydney-London flight is equivalent to 9,600 nautical miles. “These aircraft, we think, are potentially real goers on these routes,” Qantas CEO Alan Joyce told Reuters of the A350-900ULR and the bigger but less advanced Boeing 777-8. “You know from what they have done on other aircraft that Sydney-London and Melbourne-London has real possibility.” For Qantas, a non-stop Sydney-London route that cuts three hours off the flight time would allow it to charge a premium and differentiate its product from the around two dozen other airlines plying the so-called Kangaroo route with stop-offs in Singapore, Dubai and Hong Kong. The route accounts for only 13 per cent of Qantas’ international capacity, but carries the prestige QF1 flight number and is important to its global brand. Qantas could charge around a 20 per cent price premium for a non-stop Sydney-London flight as it would attract business and premium leisure travellers wanting to complete the trip as fast as possible, said Rico Merkert, a professor specialising in transport at the University of Sydney’s business school. “It’s something that can be presented as a unique selling point for Qantas,” he said. Fuelling doubts Qantas begins non-stop flights from Perth to London next year, using the Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner. For this scheduled flight, the Dreamliner will have fewer seats than usual, will use the most advanced flight path modelling methods, and will reduce the weight in areas seemingly as minor as the dishes and forks. The Perth flight will take 17 hours — a far cry from the four days and seven stops it took when Qantas created the Kangaroo Route to London in 1947. Qantas can offset the higher cost of carrying more fuel to complete the flight by saving on stopover costs, such as airport charges, ground handling, taxes, crew hotel rooms and lounge usage. “In terms of economics, much depends on fuel prices,” said Teal Group aerospace analyst Richard Aboulafia. “If they stay at $50 a barrel or less, it should be possible to keep costs reasonable. But as fuel goes up, the disadvantages of flying a very heavy plane begin to make ultra-long haul problematic.” He said the flight should remain economic at prices below around $70 a barrel, though Leeham Co analyst Bjorn Fehrm said the actual level could be far higher as one-stop rivals would also be squeezed by higher oil prices. Singapore Airlines ended its New York and Los Angeles flights using the four-engined A340-500 in 2013 when oil prices topped $107 a barrel. The carrier is now waiting for delivery of the far more fuel-efficient twin-engined A350-900ULR next year. Headwinds Qantas is pushing the plane makers hard on a stretch goal of completing the Sydney-London flight with 300 seats to give it the highest possible revenue and fleet flexibility. However, Fehrm said the aircraft would likely fall short of that goal if Qantas wanted to avoid a fuel stop on the westbound leg when headwinds are strongest. If such stopovers became frequent enough, Qantas would lose its ability to charge a premium on the route. Two aviation industry sources said the Airbus A350-900ULR would fit more than 250 passengers on the Sydney-London route, up from the 170 mainly business-class seats on Singapore Airlines’ configuration for flights to New York and Los Angeles. Boeing’s 777-8, due to enter service early in the next decade, could carry around 280 passengers on the westbound leg of the Sydney-London flight, the sources said. The sources declined to be named because the configuration details are not finalised. Airbus and Boeing declined to comment specifically on the seat count. “We think our aeroplane has the legs and the capability,” said Dinesh Keskar, Boeing Senior Vice President Sales Asia-Pacific and India. “If the 787-9 can do Perth-London, we think that when the 777-8 comes out in the 2021 time frame we will have a lot more improvement in technology.” Airbus, Boeing and engine manufacturers are constantly investing to reduce fuel usage, extending a plane’s range and its ability to perform in hot conditions like the Middle East. That means the plane makers don’t have to invest specifically for any Qantas order, the size of which is still unclear. Pushing the seat count towards 300 would also give Qantas the flexibility to use these aircraft on other long routes, such as a mooted Sydney-New York flight, as it looks to replace six ageing 747-400ER planes and eventually its fleet of 12 A380s. Best pricing Qantas’ Joyce has raised publicly the possibility of ordering the 777-8 for ultra-long haul flights for the last two years, but the A350-900ULR has entered the equation more recently. “It has added competition, and we would be crazy if we didn’t do a competition at the right time,” Joyce said. “That gets you the best pricing and ... the most capable aircraft.” Qantas has yet to launch a formal tender process for the prestige order, as it waits for Boeing to finalise the specifications on the 777-8. But the first Sydney-London flights are possible around 2022, Joyce said. “The Kangaroo route is probably the most competitive on the globe,” Joyce said. “[Flying non-stop] takes us off this superhighway of very competitive conditions of capacity which is priced, in many cases, under costs.” More from Aviation Dubai declaration on cyber security announced Boeing teams with JetBlue to fund electric plane Airlines use innovations to lure passengers KLM calls for Brexit compromise Etihad completes 5 years of operations to Kuwait 03:19 am Dnata looking for more catering acquisitions Emirates to launch second daily service to Bali Use free tablets on Emirates flights tags from this storyIndia follow this tag on MGNDubai follow this tag on MGNQantas follow this tag on MGN filed underGulfNewsBusinessAviation tagsIndia follow this tag on MGN+ MGNDubai follow this tag on MGN+ MGNQantas follow this tag on MGN+ MGN Also In AviationDubai declaration on cyber security announced Business Gallery Pictures: Gitex Shopper Spring 2017 Manufacturing is order of the day Business Videos PlayAbu Dhabi Ship Building enjoys growing success Strata UAE leads aerospace manufacturing FOLLOW US Most Popular ViewedCommentedGalleriesVideos 01Airlines use innovations to lure passengers 02Airbus, Boeing close in on Qantas’ dream 03Airbus may ditch A380’s grand staircase 04Dubai declaration on cyber security announced 05Boeing teams with JetBlue to fund electric plane 10Images A peek at the world's next tallest tower Apr 11, 2016 8Images Massive development at Abu Dhabi airport Mar 11, 2017 6Images Manufacturing is order of the day Mar 28, 2017 29Images In pictures: Defence exhibition Idex 2017 Feb 23, 2017 Play Abu Dhabi Ship Building enjoys growing success Nov 24, 2016 Play Strata UAE leads aerospace manufacturing Oct 25, 2016 Play Emirates opens SkyPharma in Dubai Sep 18, 2016 Play Video: Electronics fiesta as Gitex opens Oct 01, 2016 Explore the UAE Find the right airport Currency Converter first-currency currencyAEDDinarRupee= first-currency currencyINRDinarRupee Most Popular on Gulf News Dubai fire: Police rescue 4 trapped workers 2017 UAE holidays Big fat Indian wedding on cruise ship Indian student jumps to death on Facebook Indian expat bags Dh10m after 50 tickets Stop driving licences for expats: Kuwait MP Dubai moves towards new rental law Dubai landlords cut rents, extend leases Are temperatures set to drop in UAE?

Turkey's Central Bank pushes rates to the max before referendum How to avoid terrorist attacks: technical and political measures Vestnik Kavkaza News Analysis Interviews Articles World press review Photo gallery Video Radio Persons AnalysisIranWorldPoliticsEconomy Boeing Battles Airbus For Billions In Iran Apr 6 - 12:57 pm Forbes Iran Aseman Airlines signed a tentative deal on Tuesday to buy at least 30 Boeing 737 MAX aircraft in a deal worth about $3 billion. Preceded by a $16.6 billion sale of 80 aircraft to Iran Air under the Obama administration, Tuesday's sale is going to be a major test of Boeing's ties to President Donald Trump. Forbes reports about the details in its article High Stakes For Trump As Boeing Battles Airbus For Billions In Iran Even though Trump has not publicly voiced his opposition to U.S. aircraft sales to Iran, the president has consistently criticized the country for being a state sponsor of terrorism as well as a destabilizing force in the Middle East. He has also repeatedly denounced the 2015 nuclear agreement which opened the door for western aviation companies to sell their jets to Iranian airlines. For decades, U.S. sanctions prevented Iranian civilian aviation from buying western-made planes and spare parts which led to countless accidents and a rusty old airliner fleet requiring a $20 billion investment. As can be seen from the following infographic, both Boeing and Airbus have inked lucrative deals in the country since the nuclear deal was signed. However, given Trump's hostile stance on Iran and his pledge to protect and restore American manufacturing jobs, the president may find himself between a rock and a hard place. Tuesday's agreement requires U.S. government approval and marks the first big business deal announced by any American company in Iran since Trump took office in January. Most notably, Boeing said in a statement that "an aerospace sale of this magnitude creates or sustains approximately 18,000 jobs in the United States". For President Trump, the stakes could not be higher. Last month, the U.S. imposed sanctions on 25 Iranian entities and individuals over missile tests in the country while Iran was also included on the list of Muslim-majority countries subject to a controversial visa ban - a ban which is still held up in the courts. Blocking Boeing's sales would put Trump's policy of protecting U.S. manufacturing jobs into direct conflict with his administration's hostile stance towards Tehran. The president certainly has a dilemma on his hands. 1365 views Analysis Iran Iran News World World news Politics Economy Barack Obama USA Iran and the US Donald Trump Boeing Airbus More ...

Pushing the seat count towards 300 would also give Qantas the flexibility to use these aircraft on other long routes, such as a mooted Sydney-New York flight, as it looks to replace six ageing 747-400ER planes and eventually its fleet of 12 A380s. BEST PRICING Qantas' Joyce has raised publicly the possibility of ordering the 777-8 for ultra-long haul flights for the last two years, but the A350-900ULR has entered the equation more recently. "It has added competition, and we would be crazy if we didn't do a competition at the right time," Joyce said. "That gets you the best pricing and ... the most capable aircraft." Qantas has yet to launch a formal tender process for the prestige order, as it waits for Boeing to finalise the specifications on the 777-8. But the first Sydney-London flights are possible around 2022, Joyce said. "The Kangaroo route is probably the most competitive on the globe," Joyce said. "(Flying non-stop) takes us off this superhighway of very competitive conditions of capacity which is priced, in many cases, under costs."

Reuters Business Standard http://bsmedia.business-standard.com/_media/bs/wap/images/bs_logo_amp.png 177 22 Airbus, Boeing close in on Qantas' ultra-long haul dream By Jamie Freed SYDNEY (Reuters) - Both Airbus and Boeing now offer aircraft that appear capable of flying non-stop commercial flights from Sydney to London - the "Holy Grail" for Australian carrier Qantas Airways Ltd. As long as oil prices don't go much higher than around $70 per barrel, the 20-hour flight can be financially viable, and could be on schedules within five years, aviation experts say. Airbus has increased the range of its A350-900ULR to 9,700 nautical miles (17,960 kms) from the 8,700 nautical miles announced when it sold the plane to Singapore Airlines in 2015 for delivery next year, a spokesman told Reuters. Including headwinds, the Sydney-London flight is equivalent to 9,600 nautical miles. "These aircraft, we think, are potentially real goers on these routes," Qantas CEO Alan Joyce told Reuters of the A350-900ULR and the bigger but less advanced Boeing 777-8. "You know from what they have done on other aircraft that Sydney-London and Melbourne-London has real possibility." For Qantas, a non-stop Sydney-London route that cuts three hours off the flight time would allow it to charge a premium and differentiate its product from the around two dozen other airlines plying the so-called Kangaroo route with stop-offs in Singapore, Dubai and Hong Kong. The route accounts for only 13 percent of Qantas' international capacity, but carries the prestige QF1 flight number and is important to its global brand. Qantas could charge around a 20 percent price premium for a non-stop Sydney-London flight as it would attract business and premium leisure travellers wanting to complete the trip as fast as possible, said Rico Merkert, a professor specialising in transport at the University of Sydney's business school. "It's something that can be presented as a unique selling point for Qantas," he said. FUELLING DOUBTS Qantas begins non-stop flights from Perth to London next year, using the Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner. For this scheduled flight, the Dreamliner will have fewer seats than usual, will use the most advanced flight path modelling methods, and will reduce the weight in areas seemingly as minor as the dishes and forks. The Perth flight will take 17 hours - a far cry from the four days and seven stops it took when Qantas created the Kangaroo Route to London in 1947. Qantas can offset the higher cost of carrying more fuel to complete the flight by saving on stopover costs, such as airport charges, ground handling, taxes, crew hotel rooms and lounge usage. "In terms of economics, much depends on fuel prices," said Teal Group aerospace analyst Richard Aboulafia. "If they stay at $50 a barrel or less, it should be possible to keep costs reasonable. But as fuel goes up, the disadvantages of flying a very heavy plane begin to make ultra-long haul problematic." He said the flight should remain economic at prices below around $70 a barrel, though Leeham Co analyst Bjorn Fehrm said the actual level could be far higher as one-stop rivals would also be squeezed by higher oil prices. Singapore Airlines ended its New York and Los Angeles flights using the four-engined A340-500 in 2013 when oil prices topped $107 a barrel. The carrier is now waiting for delivery of the far more fuel-efficient twin-engined A350-900ULR next year. HEADWINDS Qantas is pushing the planemakers hard on a stretch goal of completing the Sydney-London flight with 300 seats to give it the highest possible revenue and fleet flexibility. However, Fehrm said the aircraft would likely fall short of that goal if Qantas wanted to avoid a fuel stop on the westbound leg when headwinds are strongest. If such stopovers became frequent enough, Qantas would lose its ability to charge a premium on the route. Two aviation industry sources said the Airbus A350-900ULR would fit more than 250 passengers on the Sydney-London route, up from the 170 mainly business-class seats on Singapore Airlines' configuration for flights to New York and Los Angeles. Boeing's 777-8, due to enter service early in the next decade, could carry around 280 passengers on the westbound leg of the Sydney-London flight, the sources said. The sources declined to be named because the configuration details are not finalised. Airbus and Boeing declined to comment specifically on the seat count. "We think our airplane has the legs and the capability," said Dinesh Keskar, Boeing Senior Vice President Sales Asia-Pacific and India. "If the 787-9 can do Perth-London, we think that when the 777-8 comes out in the 2021 timeframe we will have a lot more improvement in technology." Airbus, Boeing and engine manufacturers are constantly investing to reduce fuel usage, extending a plane's range and its ability to perform in hot conditions like the Middle East. That means the planemakers don't have to invest specifically for any Qantas order, the size of which is still unclear. Pushing the seat count towards 300 would also give Qantas the flexibility to use these aircraft on other long routes, such as a mooted Sydney-New York flight, as it looks to replace six ageing 747-400ER planes and eventually its fleet of 12 A380s.

 UPDATE 1-Boeing forms venture group, invests in two tech startups Reuters Apr. 5, 2017, 2:17 PM 535 facebook linkedin twitter email print (Adds detail about General Electric, quote from Upskill chief executive) By Alwyn Scott SEATTLE, April 5 (Reuters) - Boeing Co said on Wednesday it had launched a venture capital arm and invested in two tech startups, a fresh sign of the importance big companies see in keeping up with rapidly evolving technology for designing and making products. Boeing's new division, known as HorizonX, invested in Upskill, a Washington, D.C.-based software company that uses Google Glass-type eye wear to help assembly workers with complex tasks such as creating wiring bundles for Boeing jetliners. It also invested in Zunum Aero, a Seattle-area company that is working on electric-hybrid aircraft aimed at bringing down the cost of flying to regional airports. Zunum also received funding from JetBlue Technology Ventures, a unit of the New York-based JetBlue Airways Corp. Boeing and JetBlue are not alone in taking stakes in promising technology companies. General Electric Co's venture arm invested in an earlier Upskill funding round, and Airbus has had a venture fund since 2014. Upskill said its software platform brings data typically stored in books into workers' tools. The system can be used in manufacturing, field service and shipping and warehouse logistics, and the company's revenue growth is in triple digits annually, Chief Executive Officer Brian Ballard told Reuters. "Imagine working on a car and not having to flip through the paper manual," Ballard said. Typical systems pay back in a few months. Upskill has been working with Boeing for two years and has moved beyond pilot tests into production. Boeing declined to specify the investment amounts. "But this initiative represents a multi-year commitment by Boeing to spend tens of millions of dollars a year to advance innovation and to supplement our research and development efforts," spokesman Chaz Bickers said. "While the levels of investment generally are not material to Boeing's financials, they generally will be to our target investments." Steve Nordlund, former vice president of strategy for Boeing's defense, space and security business, will head HorizonX. Nordlund was involved in launching drone-maker Insitu Inc, which Boeing acquired in 2008. He also has worked in sales at IBM and was chief information officer at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University.

General Electric Co's venture arm invested in an earlier Upskill funding round, and Airbus has had a venture fund since 2014. Boeing is not aiming to profit from the ventures directly but instead to access technology used in autonomous vehicles, machine learning, additive manufacturing and wearable devices, said Steve Nordlund, a Boeing vice president who heads HorizonX. "These are all starting to converge and have the potential to fundamentally change how we operate inside and outside of companies," he said. Upskill's software platform for example, brings data typically stored in books into workers' tools. The system can be used in manufacturing, field service and shipping and warehouse logistics, and the company's revenue growth is in triple digits annually, Chief Executive Officer Brian Ballard told Reuters.

REUTERS/Stephane Mahe By Jamie Freed | SYDNEY SYDNEY Both Airbus and Boeing now offer aircraft that appear capable of flying non-stop commercial flights from Sydney to London - the "Holy Grail" for Australian carrier Qantas Airways Ltd. As long as oil prices don't go much higher than around $70 per barrel, the 20-hour flight can be financially viable, and could be on schedules within five years, aviation experts say. Airbus has increased the range of its A350-900ULR to 9,700 nautical miles (17,960 kms) from the 8,700 nautical miles announced when it sold the plane to Singapore Airlines in 2015 for delivery next year, a spokesman told Reuters. Including headwinds, the Sydney-London flight is equivalent to 9,600 nautical miles. "These aircraft, we think, are potentially real goers on these routes," Qantas CEO Alan Joyce told Reuters of the A350-900ULR and the bigger but less advanced Boeing 777-8. "You know from what they have done on other aircraft that Sydney-London and Melbourne-London has real possibility." For Qantas, a non-stop Sydney-London route that cuts three hours off the flight time would allow it to charge a premium and differentiate its product from the around two dozen other airlines plying the so-called Kangaroo route with stop-offs in Singapore, Dubai and Hong Kong. The route accounts for only 13 percent of Qantas' international capacity, but carries the prestige QF1 flight number and is important to its global brand. Qantas could charge around a 20 percent price premium for a non-stop Sydney-London flight as it would attract business and premium leisure travellers wanting to complete the trip as fast as possible, said Rico Merkert, a professor specialising in transport at the University of Sydney's business school. "It's something that can be presented as a unique selling point for Qantas," he said. FUELLING DOUBTS Qantas begins non-stop flights from Perth to London next year, using the Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner. For this scheduled flight, the Dreamliner will have fewer seats than usual, will use the most advanced flight path modelling methods, and will reduce the weight in areas seemingly as minor as the dishes and forks. The Perth flight will take 17 hours - a far cry from the four days and seven stops it took when Qantas created the Kangaroo Route to London in 1947. Qantas can offset the higher cost of carrying more fuel to complete the flight by saving on stopover costs, such as airport charges, ground handling, taxes, crew hotel rooms and lounge usage. "In terms of economics, much depends on fuel prices," said Teal Group aerospace analyst Richard Aboulafia. "If they stay at $50 a barrel or less, it should be possible to keep costs reasonable. But as fuel goes up, the disadvantages of flying a very heavy plane begin to make ultra-long haul problematic." He said the flight should remain economic at prices below around $70 a barrel, though Leeham Co analyst Bjorn Fehrm said the actual level could be far higher as one-stop rivals would also be squeezed by higher oil prices. Singapore Airlines ended its New York and Los Angeles flights using the four-engined A340-500 in 2013 when oil prices topped $107 a barrel. The carrier is now waiting for delivery of the far more fuel-efficient twin-engined A350-900ULR next year. HEADWINDS Qantas is pushing the planemakers hard on a stretch goal of completing the Sydney-London flight with 300 seats to give it the highest possible revenue and fleet flexibility. However, Fehrm said the aircraft would likely fall short of that goal if Qantas wanted to avoid a fuel stop on the westbound leg when headwinds are strongest. If such stopovers became frequent enough, Qantas would lose its ability to charge a premium on the route. Two aviation industry sources said the Airbus A350-900ULR would fit more than 250 passengers on the Sydney-London route, up from the 170 mainly business-class seats on Singapore Airlines' configuration for flights to New York and Los Angeles. Boeing's 777-8, due to enter service early in the next decade, could carry around 280 passengers on the westbound leg of the Sydney-London flight, the sources said. The sources declined to be named because the configuration details are not finalised. Airbus and Boeing declined to comment specifically on the seat count. "We think our airplane has the legs and the capability," said Dinesh Keskar, Boeing Senior Vice President Sales Asia-Pacific and India. "If the 787-9 can do Perth-London, we think that when the 777-8 comes out in the 2021 timeframe we will have a lot more improvement in technology." Airbus, Boeing and engine manufacturers are constantly investing to reduce fuel usage, extending a plane's range and its ability to perform in hot conditions like the Middle East. That means the planemakers don't have to invest specifically for any Qantas order, the size of which is still unclear. Pushing the seat count towards 300 would also give Qantas the flexibility to use these aircraft on other long routes, such as a mooted Sydney-New York flight, as it looks to replace six ageing 747-400ER planes and eventually its fleet of 12 A380s. BEST PRICING Qantas' Joyce has raised publicly the possibility of ordering the 777-8 for ultra-long haul flights for the last two years, but the A350-900ULR has entered the equation more recently. "It has added competition, and we would be crazy if we didn't do a competition at the right time," Joyce said. "That gets you the best pricing and ... the most capable aircraft." Qantas has yet to launch a formal tender process for the prestige order, as it waits for Boeing to finalise the specifications on the 777-8. But the first Sydney-London flights are possible around 2022, Joyce said. "The Kangaroo route is probably the most competitive on the globe," Joyce said. "(Flying non-stop) takes us off this superhighway of very competitive conditions of capacity which is priced, in many cases, under costs."

By: PTI | New York | Updated: April 6, 2017 10:26 AM “We have been engaged with both companies for about a year, and both are as passionate as we are in this opportunity to reinvent regional air travel,” Kumar said. (Reuters) A hybrid electric aircraft startup founded by an Indian-origin entrepreneur has received investments from aerospace giants — Boeing and JetBlue owing to its goal to develop alternative propulsion aircraft. Zunum Aero, founded by Ashish Kumar three years ago in Kirkland, Washington is working to develop a an electric hybrid aircraft with potential for performance and efficiency improvements in a range of aerospace applications. “I consider us very fortunate to have backers like JetBlue and Boeing,” Kumar told the Business Insider. “We have been engaged with both companies for about a year, and both are as passionate as we are in this opportunity to reinvent regional air travel,” Kumar said. The startup intends to use the financing to further develop its proposed regional aircrafts that hold 10 to 50 passengers for flights up to 1,000 miles. The jets primarily operate on battery power with an aviation diesel or turbine range-extending power generator available as backup, a report in Fortune said. Boeing said it made the investments in the startup through the ventures arm of a new group called ‘Boeing HorizonX’, an innovation cell focused on accelerating potentially transformative aerospace technologies, manufacturing innovations and emerging business models. Boeing HorizonX is partnering with JetBlue Technology Ventures to invest in Zunum Aero. “At JetBlue Technology Ventures, our goal is to be part of a disruptive force rather than the one being disrupted, and we seek new technologies that look to change the game,” it said in a statement. Also Watch: “As a company that is also deeply committed to innovation in sustainable travel, we believe that Zunum and its quiet, environmentally friendly aircraft will light up a vast network of underutilised airports and reinvent regional travel,” JetBlue said. In a statement, Boeing HorizonX vice president Steve Nordlund said Zunum’s hybrid electric technology was leading the way in the up-and-coming segment, according to the Business Insider report. According to his profile on Zunum Aero website, Kumar has held leadership roles in Microsoft, Google, Dell, and McKinsey. His startup experience includes helping the launch Aeroxchange, now the largest electronic marketplace for the aviation industry. He has a PhD in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering from the Cornell University. Kumar spent worked as a professor of engineering at Brown University in his early career, and as a research fellow at the Sandia National Laboratories. No Comments.

Fred Katayama reports. Reuters Dog attacks on mail carriers hit 30-year high as online shopping surges The Associated Press reports that while Booming online retail sales is good news for the U.S. Postal Service, its carriers are incurring a cost: more dog bites. Dog attacks on postal workers rose last year to 6,755, up 206 from the previous year and the highest in three decades, as internet shopping booms and consumers increasingly demand seven-day-a-week package delivery and groceries dropped at their doorstep. The high for attacks dated back to the 1980s, at more than 7,000, before maulings by pit bulls and other potentially aggressive dogs became a public issue. The Postal Service released its annual figures Thursday as part of National Dog Bite Prevention Week, which begins Sunday.

Newsy1:27 Airbus wants to cram more people into world's biggest passenger plane Newsy0:55 UP NEXT Both Airbus and Boeing now offer aircraft that appear capable of flying non-stop commercial flights from Sydney to London - the "Holy Grail" for Australian carrier Qantas Airways Ltd (QAN.AX). As long as oil prices don't go much higher than around $70 per barrel, the 20-hour flight can be financially viable, and could be on schedules within five years, aviation experts say. Quotes in the article Boeing Co BA ▲ 177.37 +0.29 +0.16% Singapore Airlines Ltd SINGY ▼ 14.42 -0.12 -0.83% Qantas Airways Ltd QUBSF ▲ 3.05 +0.05 +1.67% Airbus has increased the range of its A350-900ULR to 9,700 nautical miles (17,960 kms) from the 8,700 nautical miles announced when it sold the plane to Singapore Airlines (SIAL.SI) in 2015 for delivery next year, a spokesman told Reuters. Including headwinds, the Sydney-London flight is equivalent to 9,600 nautical miles. "These aircraft, we think, are potentially real goers on these routes," Qantas CEO Alan Joyce told Reuters of the A350-900ULR and the bigger but less advanced Boeing 777-8. "You know from what they have done on other aircraft that Sydney-London and Melbourne-London has real possibility." For Qantas, a non-stop Sydney-London route that cuts three hours off the flight time would allow it to charge a premium and differentiate its product from the around two dozen other airlines plying the so-called Kangaroo route with stop-offs in Singapore, Dubai and Hong Kong. The route accounts for only 13 percent of Qantas' international capacity, but carries the prestige QF1 flight number and is important to its global brand. Qantas could charge around a 20 percent price premium for a non-stop Sydney-London flight as it would attract business and premium leisure travelers wanting to complete the trip as fast as possible, said Rico Merkert, a professor specializing in transport at the University of Sydney's business school. "It's something that can be presented as a unique selling point for Qantas," he said. FUELLING DOUBTS Qantas begins non-stop flights from Perth to London next year, using the Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner. For this scheduled flight, the Dreamliner will have fewer seats than usual, will use the most advanced flight path modeling methods, and will reduce the weight in areas seemingly as minor as the dishes and forks. The Perth flight will take 17 hours - a far cry from the four days and seven stops it took when Qantas created the Kangaroo Route to London in 1947. Qantas can offset the higher cost of carrying more fuel to complete the flight by saving on stopover costs, such as airport charges, ground handling, taxes, crew hotel rooms and lounge usage. "In terms of economics, much depends on fuel prices," said Teal Group aerospace analyst Richard Aboulafia. "If they stay at $50 a barrel or less, it should be possible to keep costs reasonable. But as fuel goes up, the disadvantages of flying a very heavy plane begin to make ultra-long haul problematic." He said the flight should remain economic at prices below around $70 a barrel, though Leeham Co analyst Bjorn Fehrm said the actual level could be far higher as one-stop rivals would also be squeezed by higher oil prices. Singapore Airlines ended its New York and Los Angeles flights using the four-engined A340-500 in 2013 when oil prices topped $107 a barrel. The carrier is now waiting for delivery of the far more fuel-efficient twin-engined A350-900ULR next year.© REUTERS/Paul Ellis/Pool/File Photo FILE PHOTO: Rolls Royce Trent XWB engines, designed specifically for the Airbus A350 family of aircraft, are seen on the assembly line at the Rolls Royce factory in Derby HEADWINDS Qantas is pushing the planemakers hard on a stretch goal of completing the Sydney-London flight with 300 seats to give it the highest possible revenue and fleet flexibility. However, Fehrm said the aircraft would likely fall short of that goal if Qantas wanted to avoid a fuel stop on the westbound leg when headwinds are strongest. If such stopovers became frequent enough, Qantas would lose its ability to charge a premium on the route. Two aviation industry sources said the Airbus A350-900ULR would fit more than 250 passengers on the Sydney-London route, up from the 170 mainly business-class seats on Singapore Airlines' configuration for flights to New York and Los Angeles. Boeing's 777-8, due to enter service early in the next decade, could carry around 280 passengers on the westbound leg of the Sydney-London flight, the sources said. The sources declined to be named because the configuration details are not finalised. Airbus and Boeing declined to comment specifically on the seat count. "We think our airplane has the legs and the capability," said Dinesh Keskar, Boeing Senior Vice President Sales Asia-Pacific and India. "If the 787-9 can do Perth-London, we think that when the 777-8 comes out in the 2021 timeframe we will have a lot more improvement in technology." Airbus, Boeing and engine manufacturers are constantly investing to reduce fuel usage, extending a plane's range and its ability to perform in hot conditions like the Middle East. That means the planemakers don't have to invest specifically for any Qantas order, the size of which is still unclear. Pushing the seat count towards 300 would also give Qantas the flexibility to use these aircraft on other long routes, such as a mooted Sydney-New York flight, as it looks to replace six ageing 747-400ER planes and eventually its fleet of 12 A380s.© REUTERS/Regis Duvignau/File Photo FILE PHOTO: The logo of an Airbus A350-1000 is pictured on a scale model during its maiden flight event in Colomiers near Toulouse BEST PRICING Qantas' Joyce has raised publicly the possibility of ordering the 777-8 for ultra-long haul flights for the last two years, but the A350-900ULR has entered the equation more recently. "It has added competition, and we would be crazy if we didn't do a competition at the right time," Joyce said. "That gets you the best pricing and ... the most capable aircraft." Qantas has yet to launch a formal tender process for the prestige order, as it waits for Boeing to finalize the specifications on the 777-8. But the first Sydney-London flights are possible around 2022, Joyce said. "The Kangaroo route is probably the most competitive on the globe," Joyce said. "(Flying non-stop) takes us off this superhighway of very competitive conditions of capacity which is priced, in many cases, under costs."

Pushing the seat count towards 300 would also give Qantas the flexibility to use these aircraft on other long routes, such as a mooted Sydney-New York flight, as it looks to replace six ageing 747-400ER planes and eventually its fleet of 12 A380s. Joyce has raised publicly the possibility of ordering the 777-8 for ultra-long haul flights for the last two years, but the A350-900ULR has entered the equation more recently. “It has added competition, and we would be crazy if we didn’t do a competition at the right time,” Joyce said. “That gets you the best pricing and … the most capable aircraft.” Qantas has yet to launch a formal tender process for the prestige order, as it waits for Boeing to finalise the specifications on the 777-8. But the first Sydney-London flights are possible about 2022, Joyce said. “The kangaroo route is probably the most competitive on the globe,” Joyce said. “[Flying non-stop] takes us off this superhighway of very competitive conditions of capacity which is priced, in many cases, under costs.” Topics Qantas Airline industry Business (Australia) Sydney Air transport Boeing news Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Reuse this content View all comments > Order by newest oldest recommendations Show 25 25 50 100 All Threads collapsed expanded unthreaded Loading comments… Trouble loading?

Airbus took 26 orders in the quarter to end March, 19 of which were for the soon to be discontinued A320ceo, and just one for its successor, the A320neo. Taking 20 cancellations and changes into consideration, Airbus was left with a net order increase of six aircraft. In contrast, Boeing took 190 commercial aircraft orders in the period, with cancellations and conversions to other models bringing the net order total down to 162. The 737 received 165 orders from unidentified customers, with the 787 adding 11 and the 777 another nine. Boeing delivered 169 commercial aircraft in the quarter, including 113 737s and 32 787s. Airbus delivered 136 planes including 26 of the heavily delayed A320neo, as Pratt & Whitney engine delivery problems continued to affect production. Airbus continued its ramp up of A350 deliveries with 13 A350-900s going out to customers in the quarter.

Quiet Logistics, which ships apparel out of its Devens, Mass., warehouse, had been using robots made by a company called Kiva Systems. When Amazon bought Kiva in 2012, Quiet hired scientists. In 2015 it spun out a new company called Locus Robotics, which raised $8 million in venture capital. Last year, Locus unveiled its own warehouse robotics solution called the LocusBot — first using it for its own business, then selling them to other companies. Amazon.com boxes are shown stacked near a Boeing 767 Amazon "Prime Air" cargo plane on display in a Boeing hangar in Seattle. ASSOCIATED PRESS Enlarge Now, Locus has landed a bigger fish: It’s selling its robots to DHL Worldwide Express, the world’s largest third-party logistics company. DHL will use the machines at a Southhaven, Miss., location to help ship surgical devices to operating rooms across the country. To do that, Locus’s software directs a LocusBot to a shelf where the specific item is located. A human worker meets it there, reads a description of the item off an iPad, and drops it into a plastic bucket mounted on the machine. The idea is that the robot does the majority of the traveling, while the worker simply patrols a specified zone. “The first trend was to try to replace humans,” said Rick Faulk, chief executive of Locus. “Now it’s about humans and robots working collaboratively.” Locus isn’t alone. Amazon’s acquisition of Kiva set off an arms race among robot makers and shippers across the United States who scurried to keep up with the e-commerce giant. That includes 6 River Systems, a Waltham, Mass.-based company founded by former Kiva employees, which this week is showing its robot at ProMat, an industry trade show in Chicago. The big changes in warehouse robotics, said Adrian Kumar, vice president for solutions design at DHL, come in response to the rise of e-commerce. For decades, operators were focused on the task of loading pallets and shipping them to retailers, who broke up the shipments and routed them to retail locations. Fulfilling online orders, on the other hand, requires shippers to pack boxes with a diverse set of individual items and route them on to customers’ homes. That shift has given way to what people in the business call collaborative robotics, in which a human warehouse worker toils alongside an autonomous machine. At the Quiet Logistics warehouse, the robots shorten the distance a warehouse worker travels on a typical day from 14 miles to less than 5 miles, Mr. Faulk said. The robots, meanwhile, park themselves directly in front of the shelf that the worker is supposed to pick from, decreasing the risk the human will pick the wrong item. That makes the job easier, and is appealing to employees. “Working with robots is a fun thing to do,” Mr. Faulk said. What that means for warehouse humans is an open question. There were 939,000 people working in the industry in February, up 44 percent over the past 10 years, according to data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.

Jacques Boissinot / THE CANADIAN PRESS Share Adjust Comment Print QUEBEC — In the heat of the moment, mistakes get made. The Coalition Avenir Québec (CAQ), the second opposition party in the National Assembly, conceded Thursday it made a serious error when it claimed Bombardier’s chairman Pierre Beaudoin was being grossly overpaid compared to industry standards. Questioning premier Philippe Couillard in the debate over Bombardier executive salary increases, CAQ leader François Legault asked how Quebec can tolerate to pay Beaudoin $5 million a year when Dennis A. Muilenburg, the chairman and CEO of the giant Boeing aircraft manufacturing company, earned a mere US$326,000 a year ($437,950). Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg speaks to the media at Trump Tower following a meeting with Pesident-elect Donald Trump on January 17, 2017 in New York City. Spencer Platt / Getty Images Turns out Muilenburg, in 2016, actually earned US$15 million, a number confirmed to the Montreal Gazette by Boeing corporate spokesperson Chaz Bickers. The $15 million includes a base salary of US$1.64 million, stock awards of US$5.2 million and incentive compensation totalling US$6.43 million. “We had the wrong person,” CAQ spokesperson Émilie Toussaint said. “We took a regular board member, an administrator, who earns US$326,000. We made a mistake.” The CAQ also continues to say Beaudoin is earning $5 million a year. In fact, he renounced an increase which would have brought his salary to $5 million. His salary is staying at $3.8 million. The premier’s office was far from amused by the CAQ’s error. “François Legault once again demonstrates his lack of rigour and reliability in publishing erroneous information,” said Couillard’s spokesman Charles Robert. “The leader of the CAQ, once again, preferred to put on a show for the television cameras rather than participate honestly in the debate. “François Legault and his team often act impulsively and without reflection. It has become their trademark.” The incident took place in a week where the Bombardier salary question dominated question period in the legislature. The opposition parties tried to get the legislature to call for the increases to be cancelled but the Liberals stuck with Bombardier despite public anger. The Liberals blocked or voted down four different resolutions on the issue. pauthier@postmedia.com twitter.com/PhilipAuthier PQ tables new motion on Bombardier as war of words continues Four years later, still no court decision on private Villanueva complaint...

(NYSE: BA) delivered 169 commercial jets in the first quarter of 2017, setting the company up to exceed its projected total for this year. Boeing delivered 748 commercial jets in 2016 and in January forecast deliveries of 760 to 765 for 2017, roughly equal to the 762 planes it delivered in 2015. This is, as the saying goes, old news because the company had already reported March deliveries and anyone with a calculator (or a pencil and paper) could have done the basic arithmetic. Still, it is a good showing for Boeing and is contributing to a modest move higher for the stock price. In another, more interesting, story, Moody’s Investors Service released a report today on the Boeing’s prospects to win the $16.3 billion contract to design and build a new training jet for the U.S. Air Force. The contract for the new trainer, dubbed the T-X, is expected to be awarded before the end of this year. According to a report at Washington Business Journal, Moody’s said: We believe Boeing’s need to bolster its position as a prime contractor on a significant [Department of Defense] program following missing out on the next generation fighter and, most recently, on the next generation bomber, could have caused it to aggressively bid for the T-X contract. The consensus opinion is that the contract is going to go to the low bidder, period. Other certain competitors are teams led by Lockheed Martin Corp. (NYSE: LMT) and DRS Technologies, the U.S.-based division of Italy’s Leonardo. Boeing is teamed with Saab and is the only team offering a clean-sheet design for the T-X. With demand for passenger planes softening, building up the company’s military business is a top priority. Boeing recently received an order to fit 17 P-8A maritime patrol planes that are based on the 737 airframe. Including options for 32 additional planes, the contract could potentially reach $6.8 billion for Boeing. Here’s the rundown on Boeing’s first-quarter deliveries of commercial jets: 737 family: 113 747 family: 1 (an operating lease) 767 family: 2 777 family: 21 787 family: 32 Boeing also delivered 3 F-15 and 6 F/A-18 fighter jets in the quarter, along with three new Apache helicopters and 13 remanufactured Apaches, as well as with a total of 12 new and remanufactured Chinook helicopters and 3 P-8 patrol planes.

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    The Democrats and old-guard news media who spy a KGB agent behind every filing cabinet in President Trump’s White House are aggressively apathetic about Hillary and Bill Clinton’s decisions that gave aid and comfort to Russia. During a visit to Moscow on March 24, 2010, Mrs. Clinton explained the purpose of America’s "reset" with the Kremlin, "Our goal is to help strengthen Russia." The Clinton’s shadiest Russian deal is called Uranium One. This outrage should mushroom into Hillary and Bill’s glow-in-the-dark Whitewater. Frank Giustra, a Canadian mining mogul and major Clinton Foundation donor, led a group of investors in an enterprise called Uranium One. On June 8, 2010, Rosatom — Russia’s State Atomic Energy Corporation — announced plans to purchase a 51.4 percent stake in the Canadian company, whose international assets included some 20 percent of America’s Uranium capacity. Because Uranium is a strategic commodity, this $1.3 billion deal required the approval of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS). Hillary was one of nine top federal officials on that secretive panel. On June 29, 2010 Bill Clinton keynoted a seminar staged by Renaissance Capital in Moscow, a reputedly Kremlin-controlled investment bank that promoted this transaction. It paid him $500,000 for a one-hour speech. While CFIUS evaluated Rosatom’s offer, Clinton Cash author Peter Schweizer observed, "a spontaneous outbreak of philanthropy among eight shareholders in Uranium One” erupted. These included Uranium One’s then-chairman, Ian Telfer, who donated $3.1 million to the Clinton Foundation and related charities. Giustra himself gave the Clinton Foundation $131.3 million. Before, during, and after CFIUS’ review, Schweizer calculates, "shareholders involved in this transaction had transferred approximately $145 million to the Clinton Foundation or its initiatives." Hillary could have stopped Vladimir Putin from controlling one-fifth of U.S. uranium supplies. But no. On October 23, 2010, CFIUS approved Rosatom’s purchase of a majority stake in Uranium One. Thanks to subsequent investments, Rosatom controlled 100 percent of Uranium One by January 22, 2013. That’s when Pravda boasted, "Russian nuclear energy conquers the world." Hillary helped Boeing seal a major sale to the Kremlin. "We’re delighted that a new Russian airline, Rosavia, is actively considering the acquisition of Boeing aircraft. And this is a shameless pitch for Rosavia," Clinton said in Moscow on October 13, 2009. On June 1, 2010, the Kremlin decided to buy as many as 50 Boeing 737 jets for Russia’s national airline, Aeroflot. The price? A reported $3.7 billion. That Aug. 17, just 10 weeks later, Boeing announced a $900,000 gift to the Clinton Foundation to, "help support the reconstruction of Haiti’s public education system" after a massive earthquake pulverized the impoverished nation the previous January. The Clinton Foundation counts between $1 million and $5 million in contributions from Boeing. Hillary also favored Skolkovo, a Kremlin-sponsored "innovation city" near Moscow. The State Department arranged for 22 leading U.S. venture capitalists to tour Skolkovo in May of 2010. Cisco, Google, and Intel are among the companies that got involved. Among Skolkovo’s 28 "key partners" in 2012, 60 percent had given to the Clinton Foundation or paid speaking fees to Bill Clinton. According to The Government Accountability Institute (GAI), these 17 "key partners" gave the Clinton Foundation between $6.5 million and $23.5 million. Far more troubling, in 2014, the FBI wrote companies that operated in Skolkovo or backed the Skolkovo Foundation. "The foundation may be a means for the Russian government to access our nation’s sensitive or classified research development facilities and dual-use technologies with military and commercial application," warned Boston-based FBI agent Lucia Ziobro. The U.S. Army Foreign Military Studies Program at Fort Leavenworth concluded, "Skolkovo is arguably an overt alternative to clandestine industrial espionage." The Clintons actually did these things. When it comes to Team Trump, Democrats and their journalist pals are as relentless as bloodhounds chasing escaped jailbirds. And yet, regarding the Clintons, the Democrats and old-guard news people are as ferocious as puppies enjoying a roaring fireplace.

And what about Boeing? Rich Smith (TMFDitty) Apr 6, 2017 at 12:13PM It almost seems like every time the U.S. Congress authorizes an aid package for Israel, Boeing (NYSE:BA) and Raytheon (NYSE:RTN) cash a check. Last year, we told you about the big new defense aid package that the Obama administration proposed to benefit Israel -- a deal initially valued at as much as $40 billion over 10 years. The deal was subsequently scaled back to $38 billion, but even so, then-National Security Advisor Susan Rice called the deal "the single largest pledge of military assistance to any country in U.S. history." Recent developments suggest it could also be a very big deal for Boeing and Raytheon. Boeing and Raytheon aim to make big profits from Israeli missile defense. Image source: Getty Images. What's in the box? Not all details of what's covered by the arms package have been made public. One thing we do know, though, is that the Israeli military aid deal includes $5 billion worth of funding for Israel's new three-layered missile defense system, comprising: Iron Dome: a defense against short-range missiles and mortars, such as periodically rain down on the country from the Gaza Strip David's Sling: designed to defend against medium-range missiles such as Hezbollah is believed to possess Arrow: long-range, designed to shoot down ballistic missiles from adversaries such as Iran As investments go, these appear to be well thought out -- and well timed. Israel's Iron Dome anti-missile defense system was extensively and successfully battle-tested during Hamas' missile barrages against Israel in both 2012 and 2014. According to reports, Iron Dome successfully shot down 85% of targets it engaged during the 2012 conflict -- and approached 90% accuracy in 2014. Arrow, too, is beginning to prove its worth, having shot down a Syrian surface-to-air missile, which was targeting Israeli warplanes, just last month. And as for David's Sling, that system is scheduled to go live later this month. Good news for Boeing and Raytheon Boeing helped Israel Aerospace Industries to develop the Arrow. Raytheon collaborates with Israel's Rafael on both Iron Dome and David's Sling. As such, more money for Israel's missile defense programs is almost certain to mean more money for Boeing and Raytheon -- and that's more true now than ever before. Here's why. Israel negotiated hard for the Obama administration both to increase the amount of military aid it offers Israel and to attach fewer strings to that aid. In particular, Israel wanted to preserve and expand its right to spend U.S. military aid on contracts awarded to Israeli companies. For its part, the Obama administration sought to tie increased aid to a phasing-out of Israel's right to spend aid funds on domestic contracts -- and to require Israel to use its aid monies to purchase weapons from U.S. defense companies instead. Ultimately, the U.S. won this argument. As a result, more and more often now, Israel will be required to spend its aid money on purchases from Raytheon and Boeing -- maybe not all $5 billion of the missile defense portion of the foreign aid, but a good chunk of it. And if Raytheon and Boeing should be able to use technologies funded by U.S. aid monies and developed in cooperation with the Israelis to produce more advanced missile defense systems for sale to the U.S. military, and to other U.S. allies? That would be icing on the cake. Rich Smith has no position in any stocks mentioned. The Motley Fool has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. The Motley Fool has a disclosure policy.

Starting in the early 2020s, the Kirkland, Washington-based Zunum Aero said it aims to build aircraft with seating for 10 to 50 people and a range of at first 700 miles, then up to a thousand miles the following decade. “Simply drive to a nearby airfield and walk to your aircraft with bags in tow, for a trip that will take half the time and at a much lower fare,” the company said on its website announcement. Zunum, The Tesla Of Aircraft “Zunum Aero could be the Tesla [Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA)] of Aircraft,” Forbes trumpeted Thursday morning. The company plans to build aircraft that serve densely traveled regional routes such as San Francisco to Los Angeles or Boston to Washington, D.C., with round-trip fares as low as $100. Zunum has received backing from Boeing and JetBlue Technology Ventures, a subsidiary of JetBlue Airways. The company says its operating costs will be low and its carbon footprint far smaller than gas-guzzling jetliners. It promises drastically reduced wait times. Finding And Utilizing The Underused Zunum Aero is looking to take advantage of underused airport inventory. “Our stock of 13,500 airports is the largest in the world, yet just 140 of the largest hubs carry over 97 percent of air traffic,” the company’s website reads. “This has left many of us with long drives to catch a flight, while on shorter trips we skip air travel altogether. Communities without good air service also struggle to attract investment and create jobs.” The company claims that 40 percent of airline emissions come from regional routes. Zunum was founded by CEO Ashish Kumar, a former executive at Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT), Google (Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL)), Dell Inc. (previously traded (NASDAQ: DELL)) and McKinsey & Company, Inc. His online biography says he has a doctorate in mechanical and aerospace engineering from Cornell University and spent his early career as an engineering professor at Brown University. The chief engineer is Matt Knapp, lead designer of the ATG Javelin, a small, high-speed jet developed by Aviation Technology Group, which declared bankruptcy in 2008 after financing dried up.

Under the contract, the two companies will deliver an AN/USQ-82(V) Gigabit Ethernet Data Multiplex System, or GEDMS. The device is a multi-protocol shipwide area network solution used for real-time control system communications throughout the equipped vessel. The agreement supports the Navy's effort to modernize DDG 51 Arleigh Burke-class destroyers as well as foreign military sales to Japan and South Korea. Boeing received $6.9 million at the time of the contract award with options that can potentially raise the contract value to $116 million. Laurel Technologies received $8.3 million with a potential for $76 million in options. According to the Navy, the contract awards were subject to limited competition with two offers received. Both companies are expected to complete the work by December 2023. The Naval Sea Systems Command will manage the project. Arleigh Burke-class destroyers are warships built for open-sea warfare, and are designed to operate either independently or as part of designated strike groups. The ships are primarily manufactured by General Dynamics subsidiary Bath Iron Works and Huntington Ingalls Industries. Typical weapons include Standard Missiles, Vertical Launch ASROC Missiles, MK-46 torpedoes, and Mk-45 naval guns.

Boeing's new division, known as HorizonX, invested in Upskill, a Washington, D.C.-based software company that uses Google Glass-type eye wear to help assembly workers with complex tasks such as creating wiring bundles for Boeing jetliners. It also invested in Zunum Aero, a Seattle-area company that is working on electric-hybrid aircraft aimed at bringing down the cost of flying to regional airports. Zunum also received funding from JetBlue Technology Ventures, a unit of the New York-based JetBlue Airways Corp. Boeing and JetBlue are not alone in taking stakes in promising technology companies. General Electric Co's venture arm invested in an earlier Upskill funding round, and Airbus has had a venture fund since 2014. Boeing is not aiming to profit from the ventures directly but instead to access technology used in autonomous vehicles, machine learning, additive manufacturing and wearable devices, said Steve Nordlund, a Boeing vice president who heads HorizonX. These are all starting to converge and have the potential to fundamentally change how we operate inside and outside of companies, he said. Upskill's software platform for example, brings data typically stored in books into workers' tools. The system can be used in manufacturing, field service and shipping and warehouse logistics, and the company's revenue growth is in triple digits annually, Chief Executive Officer Brian Ballard told Reuters.

By Tas Bindi | April 5, 2017 -- 23:44 GMT (16:44 PDT) | Topic: Innovation (Image: Zunum Aero) Boeing's new HorizonX venture capital unit, joined by JetBlue Airways, has invested an undisclosed amount in Zunum Aero, a Kirkland, Washington-based startup that is developing short-haul electric aircraft to sell to major carriers for service on frequently travelled regional routes such as Boston to Washington DC, and San Francisco to Los Angeles. The three-year-old startup is currently building an aircraft that can accommodate 10 to 50 passengers as well as travel up to 700 miles initially, and as much as 1,000 miles by 2030. what's hot on zdnet DevOps: What is it, and how can it help your business? For internet privacy, a VPN won't save you Apple's desperate Mac damage control message hints at a divided company The 10 best smartphones of 2017 so far Given many carriers now favour larger aircraft that offer lower unit costs over small regional jets, Zunum said its aircraft would fill a "vast regional transport gap", with the potential to reduce travel times in busy corridors by as much as 40 percent, and by 80 percent in areas with less traffic. In addition, the startup claims that reduced operating costs -- thanks to no fuelling -- would enable 40 percent to 80 percent below current retail prices. The aircraft will initially feature hybrid propulsion, which Zunum said will deliver 80 percent lower emissions than existing aircraft. However, advancements in battery technology will mean that the aircraft's combustion engine can be replaced with an extra battery pack, thereby bringing emissions down to zero, the startup said. Zunum expects to complete its first plane by 2020, with the prototype to be finished in the next couple of years. The startup said it has been working with the Federal Aviation Administration on development of certification rules for electric aircraft, with a complete set of standards expected by 2018. As the automotive industry heads towards electric cars, electric aviation remains in its infancy -- not helped by existing battery weights and strict regulatory requirements. But moves are being made by a number of companies including Siemens, which recorded a successful trial of a 50kg electric motor in a light aircraft in Germany in July last year, and Airbus, which flew an electric motor-powered single-seat aircraft across the English Channel in 2015. Australian company MagniX also built a prototype motor for electric-powered planes recently, in conjunction with the University of Queensland and aerospace company Ferra. The motor will be trialled inside a light aircraft in 2020, MagniX said. In addition to Zunum, HorizonX has invested an undisclosed amount in Upskill, another Washington-based startup that provides software for industrial augmented reality wearables. Its technology aims to boost productivity for manufacturers, field services, and logistics companies. Boeing has used Upskill's software, Skylight, to reduce production time by 25 percent for technicians installing 130 miles of wiring in the company's 747-8 jumbo jets. The aerospace giant said its St Louis, Missouri-based VC unit, which is being led by former VP of strategy for Boeing Defense, Space, and Security Steve Nordlund, will have three focus areas: Investing in new ventures, identifying business opportunities for the company's aerospace capabilities, and assessing innovations such as autonomy, artificial intelligence, and additive manufacturing.

X Qatar Airways chief Akbar Al Baker talks EU rules and growth Interview: Ahead of the launch of the Dublin-Doha route the carrier is in bullish mood about 3 hours ago Barry O'Halloran Qatar Airways chief executive Akbar Al Baker plans to launch a Dublin to Doha service in June.         Qatar Airways chief executive Akbar Al Baker says the day could come when airline safety rules will require passengers to fly in their underwear. It’s a bizarre prospect but there’s a sense he’s only half joking. “You never know with the way things are going,” he observes. His airline is one of a number based in Muslim-majority countries from where passengers flying to the US were recently barred from bringing laptops on board. After Washington’s Department of Homeland Security announced the ban, the UK followed with one of its own though it excluded Qatar. So far, the Republic has not followed either country. This should come as some relief to Al Baker, as his airline plans to launch a Dublin to Doha service in June. His underwear remark is to emphasise that airline passengers are the ones ultimately inconvenienced by the blizzard of safety measures. “I think people are getting concerned that this kind of shooting from the hip is really not what the travelling public wants,” he says. “We [Qatar Airways] have to make our systems very robust. And you know, if that was the concern, then the [US] authorities should have said ‘you have to do a 100 per cent ETD’.” ETD stands for explosives trace detector. Now a normal part of airport security – including in the Republic – it involves swiping passengers’ luggage, equipment such as laptops, hands and whatever else, with a cloth that can be instantly machine-read to pick up virtually any molecule of explosive material. Qatar already tests 40 per cent of passengers, while on US flights, those coming on board have to remove watches, shoes, belts, jackets and so forth for screening. Laptop ban Al Baker argues that ETD is so sophisticated there is no escape. “This is a 100 per cent solution,” he says. “Okay, it will inconvenience the passenger but at least they will have their laptop.” Surprisingly given the fuss, he points out that only about 12-15 passengers bring laptops on board Qatar’s US flights. At the same time, the terrorists whom this is meant to foil are unlikely to use the airports affected, as those hubs already have tight security. “Instead of going from the airports where there is a ban, they will go to airports where there is no ban. And there are no bans in certain airports that are very risky – I don’t want to name them – but it is far easier to get on to aeroplanes from those places than it is with us,” Al Baker says. The laptop row and US president Donald Trump’s travel ban, which the courts have neutralised, created a lot of heat and light for airlines from parts of the Muslim world, including the Gulf carriers. However, it remains to be seen if those companies will suffer any damage to their bottom line. In reality, there are more potent threats looming in both the US and EU. In the US, the big three airlines, Delta, American and United, lobbied former president, Barack Obama, to limit the rights of the Gulf carriers, Qatar, Emirates and Etihad to operate in the country. The US players claimed their rivals enjoyed $42 billion worth of government subsidies and other unfair advantages. Obama did not bite but there is a view that Trump’s administration might prove more sympathetic. Al Baker dismisses the subsidies claim. “It is a load of bullshit,” he says bluntly. He argues that those doing the complaining are legacy carriers who benefitted from years of taxpayer-funded support. “The story with us is different, we got equity, not taxpayers’ money,” he says. “And we were given enough equity for us to be independent, which we are today, and we have to show profit.” Christoph Mueller tipped for top job at Abu Dhabi-based Etihad Aviation sector will be at sharp end of Brexit battle Norwegian Air’s ticket sales to the US ‘surprisingly good’ He believes Trump’s business acumen will win out should the complaint be resurrected. “We are buying American aeroplanes in big numbers and we are providing jobs, every single flight we do brings economic benefits to the US. So to us, America is first. “While we are giving people good value for money, the three American carriers actually are swindling their own people by reducing capacity so that they can artificially raise ticket prices and make record profits.” Across the Atlantic, the European Commission is drafting new regulations that could give Brussels the power to suspend non-EU airlines’ flying rights for “unfair competitive practices” that injure or threaten one or more of the bloc’s carriers. This is widely seen as a bid to counter the rise of Qatar Airways and its fellow Gulf players. Germany and France, along with their flag carriers, Lufthansa and Air France KLM, have been pressing the commission to tackle competition from the Gulf, which has shifted long-haul passengers to the east. Crying wolf Al Baker responds with the same argument he makes about the US airlines. The EU’s legacy carriers, he says, are crying wolf because they cannot get their own act together, control costs or operate efficient airports – even though they are still profitable. Qatar Airways’ problem is that Brussels appears to be listening to Lufthansa and Air France. “Yes,” he agrees, “but we have contributed to the economies of Europe. If you look at the big three Gulf carriers put together, the orders we have with Airbus, the direct and indirect jobs that we create, are far more than Lufthansa and Air France. It’s all about jobs and we are creating jobs.” He insists he does not want to tell anyone in Europe their business, but still can’t resist a go at Lufthansa which he argues is the continent’s dominant player. “All the other 27 European countries should raise an objection because Lufthansa is dominating their skies,” he says. “When you, look at Austrian, Brussels Air, Swiss Air, and Lufthansa. They also own Air Dolimiti, which is, frankly, the national carrier of northern Italy. When you put all these five airlines together, you are really controlling the skies over Europe.” On the face of it, Qatar Airways is self-supporting and profitable. Its annual report shows its operations generated a 3.05 billion riyals (€785 million) surplus in the financial year ended March 31st, 2016 while the airline flew 26.6 million passengers. It had about €24 billion in assets, of which close to €6 billion was cash. In the financial year just ended, passenger numbers hit 28 million while overall growth was in double figures. From this year it will serve more than 160 destinations and Dublin is one of 14 it will add in the year ending March 31st, 2018. Its fleet will shortly pass the 200 aircraft mark. Qatar was one of the first to fly the Airbus A380 superjumbo – taller than a lot of Dublin office buildings – and it will be the launch customer for Boeing’s 777x when it finally takes off, in or around 2020. This came from a more or less standing start 20 years ago when Al Baker took over as chief executive at the request of Sheik Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani, the Father Emir of Qatar. His brief was to develop a high quality airline that would plug the emirate into the rest of the world. Its formula was simple. It offered affordable long-haul flights through its home hub at Doha – Qatar’s capital – that connected Europe and the US with Asia and the Far East. It cashed in on a growing appetite for travel and an opening up of the skies in markets such as the EU and the Americas. While Ryanair led the low-cost revolution in Europe, Qatar stuck with full-service. Despite the impressive metrics, some observers are calling time on Qatar’s double-digit growth. This year it is predicted it will boost capacity by 7 per cent. This would have most legacy carriers reaching for a bottle of business class champagne, but it is slow compared to the speed set by the middle eastern airline over the past decade. Growth estimate Al Baker responds that if he gets the aircraft he has ordered, growth is more likely to be 15 per cent. “If I get the aircraft deliveries as promised I think we will achieve that,” he says. He does concede that Qatar will reach the limit of its growth when it matures, which he predicts will be sometime around 2020 and 2021, after that it should add a steady 4 to 5 per cent a year. He admits he is sceptical of getting the craft he needs to hit 15 per cent growth. Last June he lost patience with delays and cancelled an order with Airbus for its A320neo aircraft. Qatar later announced a new order with Boeing. The move was not out of character. Al Baker is not known as a fan of excuses. His staff refer to him as “the chief” in a tone that suggests if he wants something done, it gets done. He also has a reputation for calling things as he sees them, a characteristic that means he should feel right at home in the Republic, which is already well known for producing plain-speaking airline executives. Qatar will begin flying Dublin to Doha on June 12th. As this coincides with Ramadan, Islam’s holy month, it will delay its bells and whistles launch until July 4th. So far, its chief executive says advance bookings are healthy. “Not what I would want it to be because you know, you always want a 100 per cent load factor [airline jargon for full aircraft] which is very difficult to achieve, but we are on the way up,” he says. The airline weighs all potential new routes carefully before deciding to launch. It believes one flight a day is what the market here will absorb. Al Baker also points out it does not want to undermine its Oneworld Alliance partner, International Airlines Group (IAG), parent of Aer Lingus, Iberia, Vueling and British Airways. Not only is it a partner, Qatar owns 20 per cent of IAG, making it the group’s biggest shareholder and giving it an indirect interest in Aer Lingus. It upped its stake from almost 16 per cent when the group’s stock price dipped sharply following the UK’s Brexit vote last year. Despite being happy with IAG’s performance, Al Baker says his company will not increase its stake in the group. He notes this could be awkward as IAG already has close to the 49.9 per cent limit allowed by Brussels for non-EU owners. Would he like to see this restriction lifted? “It’s not up to me to comment on what the European Union wants to do. As far as we are concerned we just want to work together with the EU to grow our business there together with our competitors,” he says. Are there any EU airlines in which he would like to invest? He pauses before replying: “I would maybe buy Lufthansa . . .”       Topics: Akbar Al Baker Barack Obama Carsten Spohr James Hogan Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani Willie Walsh Aer Lingus Eu European Commission European Union Air Dolimiti Air France-KLM Airbus Boeing British Airways Brussels Air Iberia Lufthansa Qatar Airways Ryanair Swiss Air Vueling Doha Dublin(IE) Read More Tesla’s market capitalisation overtakes Ford New car registrations fall 7.5% in March, latest figures show Enterprise Rent-A-Car acquires Dooley Car Rentals Bus Éireann deficit rose sharply in first two months of year Dún Laoghaire gets six new GoCar car-sharing bases CityJet exercises options to buy four Bombardier aircraft UK faces having ‘no flights to or from Europe’ after Brexit  Subscribe.   More from The Irish Times Economy Irish economy fuelled by ‘Phoenix miracle’ - Central Bank Work Why managers struggle to motivate employees Golf Rory McIlory makes late surge as winds whip up stiff Masters test Ireland Open season: Irish tourist attractions come out of hibernation Sponsored Let a Hume PhD scholarship unlock your potential at Maynooth University Broadband and digital technology essential for Irish business growth Lifting the diamond to a higher level Advice for Irish companies preparing for Brexit?

The aircraft later flew back to Mumbai for repairs after Boeing Co officials went through a report sent by Jet Airways engineers on the nature and extent of damage and certified it fit to make the return journey to the base. The dent on the front edge of the right wing was detected by an engineer examining the plane after flight 9W 665 from Bengaluru landed in Kolkata. Suspecting it to have been caused by a bird-hit, the apron control at Kolkata airport was alerted to look for bird carcass around the runway. But with no trace of the dead bird, Jet Airways officials suspect the bird-hit happened during takeoff at Bengaluru and not during landing in Kolkata. Bird-hits, especially involving bigger birds like kites and eagles, are hazardous and cause extensive damage to planes. It gets particularly tricky if the bird gets sucked into the engine, damaging the blades. It can also cause a short-circuit that can in turn spark a fire. On Friday , the 141 persons on board the Jet Airways flight were lucky the bird hit the wing just above the engine and did not get drawn into it or else the Boeing 737-800 aircraft would have had to return to Bengaluru after the takeoff. There have been several bird-hits in Kolkata in the past but the number of incidents reported has gone down in recent years. Municipal authorities around the airport attribute this to better solid waste management and replacement of open garbage dumps with compactors in many places. But the bird activity around the Rajarhat end is still a cause of worry. "At the airport environment committee meeting held every six months, we tell municipal authorities to ensure cleanliness so that birds don't hang around the airport. There has been progress but there is still some distance to go," an airport official said. Stay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device.

They’re also living out the ultimate boyhood dream, of commandeering an around-the-world tour on a vintage aircraft. All three of them are avowed aerophiles — Captain and chief pilot Francisco undertook the record Azimut 270 project in 2010, circumnavigating the Earth in a Light-Sport Aircraft (along with Yannick Bovier) in 51 days; co-pilot  Paul specialises in restoring vintage aircraft; while Daniel is an engineer who doubles as the official documenter of the ongoing expedition. They’re also aficionados especially of the Douglas DC-3, an aircraft that radically changed air transport in the 1930s and 1940s. By the end of April, the trio will have reached Singapore, almost half-way through their six-month project of circling the globe on a 77-year-old DC-3 — the oldest plane ever to make such an attempt. Backed by the Swiss watchmakers Breitling, the trio have a personal mission to add to the tour — to spread their passion for aviation history. Buoyed by a dream When Francisco and Daniel were youngsters growing up  near Geneva in Switzerland, they’d spend most of their off-days on the terraces of buildings by runways and airfields, clicking pictures of aircraft. “We were plane-spotters!” says Paul, a Brit based in the US, who did a lot of the same in his teen days. “We would note down and collect the numbers of all the planes,” says Francisco, at a meeting hosted in Nagpur recently, as a part of their India stopover.  Their biggest surprise here — blistering temperatures apart — was in meeting a local student group that goes by the name, Plane Spotters India. In an encouraging note, Francisco recalls that he decided to become a pilot when he was a toddler, on a family vacation to Paris: “The air hostess invited me to the cockpit — that rarely happens nowadays.”  Their shared passion for aviation led them to Breitling, a company known for its chronographs, pilot watches and aeronautical instruments. “Over and above everything else, this is about our love for flying, which we want to share with people around the world,” offers Paul. The vintage aspect adds to the fantastic scope of their adventure. Interestingly, Paul’s restoration company, Aerometal International, in Oregon, goes by the tag line, “Continuing airworthiness in aging aircraft”, having breathed life back into a Douglas A-26 Invader and a 1942 Boeing Stearman, apart from other classic planes. While production of the DC-3 ended in 1945, today, less than 150 are estimated to be airworthy.  The craft on the current tour — marked DC-3 HB-IRJ — was delivered to American Airlines in 1940, and initially used by the US military between 1942 and 1944. With close to 75,000 flight hours, the craft is now owned by Francisco, and the company he works for, Aeropassion. “We don’t like to speak about money,” says the Captain, with a twinkle in his eye. “DC-3s sell for anywhere from $50,000 to $5 million — this was something in between,” he says, with an air of modesty. Romancing the machine The mechanical aspect of the DC-3 is its most compelling.  On the tarmac, it sputters and thrums like a vintage motor- bike on throttle. In the air, it rumbles and rolls like a round-bottomed boat. The windows have wooden panes, there’s  no air-conditioning, or even overhead storage cabins, for that matter. It also sports a curious tail wheel. The lightweight chassis, of aluminum etched metal sheets over a wooden frame, makes the aircraft shudder in spells of turbulence, and drift in strong gusts of wind. “Tailwinds are important for us,” explains Francisco, given that the DC-3 is primarily meant for short-haul, low-altitude flights. At Nagpur, the crew was informed that the special avgas (aviation gasoline) they’d reserved at Chittagong, Bangladesh, had gone missing. As a result, they flew straight to Chiang Mai, Thailand — in a flight that lasted 8 hours, 7 minutes — quite likely the longest the aircraft has flown since its maiden voyage back in 1940. They had to carefully study the winds and weather forecasts, explains Francisco, while avoiding thunderstorms over Chittagong along the route. At the peak of World War 2, the DC-3 was nicknamed the “Normandy landings plane”, being extensively used by the allied forces in its military transport version — as the Douglas C-47 Skytrain or Dakota. Dakotas were also prominently used by Indian forces in the 1947 and 1965 wars with Pakistan. Though they were rarely ever intended for long-haul travel. Their longest trip yet is expected later along their tour, adds the Captain, as they intend to make an 11-hour hop from Obihiro, Japan to Shemya, in the Aleutian Islands off the Alaskan coast. To cover that distance, half the seats on-board have been cleared out, to make room for additional gas tanks. The good thing about the short stints in air is that they’re never likely to face jet lag, notes Paul. “This isn’t a jet, and there’s no such thing as propulsion lag,” he says, matter-of-factly. The propeller-driven DC-3 has a cruise speed of about 250km/h. “We’re never going to reach supersonic speeds, and at best, we can expect to cross two or three time zones in a day.” Winging it to win it In person, the DC-3 world tour crew remains engrossed in discussions over technical aspects and auto-mechanics. Talk about Focke-Wulfs and Messerschmitts pitched against American Lockheeds, Boeing Flying Fortresses and British Bristol Beauforts spurs them into animated conversation. While the DC-3 was mainly a civilian aircraft, it came close to becoming a bomber on one occasion during WWII, recounts Francisco. On a particular sortie north of Canada, south of Greenland, the crew of a DC-3 had spotted a German U-boat (military submarine). But the plane wasn’t prepped to haul bombs. “So they actually carried bombs by hand, and were instructed to drop them through the cargo door,” narrates the Captain. “Thankfully, they didn’t spot the U-boat again, and you can safely say, the DC-3 has never been a bomber, but it came close to being one!” In Japan, the Breitling DC-3 will take part at the Iwakuni Friendship Day Air Show, in a special display for war veterans, while also offering joy rides to child victims of the 2013 tsunami. The trio will then cross the ocean to begin a grand tour of the United States, and return to Europe via Greenland and Iceland to complete its journey in September, at the Breitling Sion Airshow 2017 in Switzerland. By then, since its take-off from Geneva on March 9, earlier this year, the DC-3 will have flown 24,000 nautical miles in all.  To make things more special, the aircraft is carrying 500 limited edition engraved pieces of the Navitimer Breitling DC-3 chronograph, which will be put on sale at the end of the tour, along with signed log books and certificates.

The door of the capsule’s hatch is just to the right of Boyle’s head. (GeekWire Photo / Kevin Lisota)More COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. – The seats in Blue Origin’s suborbital spaceship are like a dentist’s chair that’s fully extended, with a big difference. You can float out of this one when weightlessness sets in. Of course, we couldn’t get the zero-G experience when we tried out the seats in a mock-up of the New Shepard crew capsule, on display here at the 33rd Space Symposium. But we did get a condensed version of the 11-minute flight scenario, from launch to landing. Our guide for the sit-in was Ariane Cornell, a member of Blue Origin’s strategy and business development team. Five other journalists and I ducked our heads, stepped through the hatch and settled into the six seats placed around the periphery of a cabin that’s about the size and shape of a big igloo. The interior was designed for Blue Origin with input from Seattle-based Teague, which also designed the cabin for Boeing’s 787 Dreamliner jet. The overall vibe is similar to what you see in a Dreamliner, right down to the cool-blue mood lighting in the cushioned walls. Blue Origin’s flight plan calls for six passengers to board the capsule at T-minus-30, strap themselves in and brace themselves for launch. Padding can be added to the seats to accommodate different body shapes. If you’re extra-tall, just bend your legs a little more when you put your feet on the footrests. “The best way here is to take a seat and then swing your legs over,” Cornell told us. Each of us had a roughly 4-foot-tall window to look through, with a display screen about the size of an Amazon Kindle Fire tablet mounted on the window’s edge. During a real spaceflight, that tablet would display views from external cameras, plus flight data for the passengers’ edification. A fisheye camera is mounted at the top of the space igloo’s ceiling. In flight, that will provide an internal view, not only for the passengers aboard the autonomously piloted capsule, but for Mission Control as well. If you don’t have your seat belt fastened properly, you’ll get a radioed reminder. Other cameras will be placed strategically around the cabin to take selfies automatically. Right beneath the fisheye, there’s a dark cylinder that looks like a table for cocktails. But don’t set a drink down on this tabletop: It’s actually the housing for a solid-rocket motor that would fire up to power the capsule away from the booster below in the event of an emergency during ascent. The system was successfully tested last October during an uncrewed flight. Blue Origin’s New Shepard suborbital rocket booster stands on display at the Space symposium. If you look closely at lower left, you can make out five tortoises that have been painted on the rocket – one tortoise for each trip to space. (GeekWire Photo / Kevin Lisota)More Passengers will feel about 3 G’s of acceleration on the way up, and at the top of the ride, they’ll get about four minutes of zero-G. There’s enough room to float free and do a Superman pose. But when you turn a somersault, be careful not to hit your fellow passengers. “Zero-G etiquette will be part of the training,” Cornell said. Read more: How Jeff Bezos is using Amazon’s success to fuel Blue Origin, a billion dollars at a time A countdown displayed in big numbers on your tablet will alert you to get back in your seat for the roller-coaster descent, which can deliver up to 5.5 G’s of acceleration. Parachutes will slow down the 8,000-pound capsule, and just before landing, a burst from the retro-thruster system will take some of the “bump” out of the touchdown. Commercial service could begin as early as 2018. The ticket price hasn’t yet been set, and it’s too soon to make reservations. But not too soon for Blue Origin to start thinking about repeat customers. “I’m sure, as soon as people go up and they come back down, they’re going to want to do it again,” Cornell said. “And we’ll be ready for them.” More from GeekWire: How Jeff Bezos is using Amazon’s success to fuel Blue Origin’s space effort, a billion dollars at a time Space geeks get up-close look at Blue Origin’s rocket ship (and try out the seats) Jeff Bezos provides a sneak peek at Blue Origin’s New Shepard spaceship (and suits) Hold on tight and hold it: Jeff Bezos says no potty breaks on Blue Origin space trips Reblog Share Tweet Share What to Read Next Don’t throw these sneakers out — you can compost them Yahoo Tech Astronomers just discovered something awesome about the most Earth-like planet ever found BGR News How Apple's secrecy can hurt consumers Yahoo Tech This is your last chance to get T-Mobile’s best promo for free BGR News Pogue’s Basics: How to speed up YouTube playback with a keystroke Yahoo Tech Robot arms are now teaching each other how to work Yahoo Tech Surface Pro 4 Just Hit Rock Bottom Price Tech Media Network (Tom's Guide) The disruption of workers by robots is about to take a giant leap forward Yahoo Tech Google's new YouTube TV lets you watch cable for $35 a month Yahoo Tech Snap up the discontinued Polaroid Cube 1080p action camera for $58 on Amazon Digital Trends ‘Thursday Night Football’ is coming to Amazon Prime next season Yahoo Tech Obsess over your dog even more with this smart pet door Yahoo Tech Astronomers may have the data they need to prove ‘Planet Nine’ exists BGR News Artificial intelligence is now trying to make sense out of the mess that is Congress Yahoo Tech

Photo: Reuters mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 6:15 AM, April 7, 2017 Updated: 6:20 AM, April 7, 2017 TOKYO - Japan's ANA Holdings Inc <9202.T>, will lease four Boeing <BA.N> 737-800 aircraft while it awaits delayed deliveries of the country's first commercial aircraft in 50 years, the 90-seat Mitsubishi Regional Jet (MRJ), a senior executive told Reuters. "We have shortages because of the delayed delivery of the MRJ," said Yuji Hirako, who took up the role of president and chief executive of ANA's airline subsidiary, All Nippon Airways Co, on April 1. ANA, Japan's largest airline, had no plans to cancel its order for 25 of the Japanese-designed jetliners, he added. The aircraft will be leased from Singapore-based BOC Aviation Limited <2588.HK> and Dublin-based SMBC Aviation Capital, a representative said. The MRJ, which is being built by a subsidiary of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries <7011.T>, was delayed for two more years in January to redesign its wiring, with first delivery now set for 2020. The latest holdup is the fifth since development began ten years ago. To tackle the delays, ANA previously said it would push back the retirement of older Boeing 737-500 aircraft and buy three DHC-8-Q400 aircraft from MRJ rival Bombardier <BBDb.TO>. Each of the 737-800s can seat up to twice as many passengers as an MRJ.

(NYSE: BA) airplanes or other investments, allowing Trump to claim he negotiated a deal to help the economy," Jacques deLisle, professor of Chinese Law at the University of Pennsylvania, told Bloomberg yesterday (April 5). "One of the few things the Chinese president could easily offer [Trump] is more Chinese investment in infrastructure and America's manufacturing heartlands, whose voters propelled the U.S. president to victory in last November's election," wrote Financial Times' Beijing bureau chief Tom Mitchell this morning. But President Trump's acceptance of these economic enticements may come at the expense of U.S. allies in Asia… The Cost of a Deal with China: The Safety of U.S. Allies "Economic deals are fleeting," wrote Michael Fuchs, a former State Department deputy secretary and current research fellow at the left-leaning Center for American Progress Institute, in The Guardian today. "Security frameworks take decades to build, but minutes to squander." Fuchs explained that if Xi offers packages of economic investments in the United States, he may very well ask that that the U.S. roll back its military presence in the Pacific in return… Specifically, the Chinese president could make the following requests: That Trump reduce the number of military exercises it carries out on the Korean peninsula That Trump attempt to restrain U.S. ally Japan in the East China Sea That the U.S. either reduce or halt its "freedom of navigation" exercises in the South China Sea Agreeing to these measures could result in our own allies doubting America's reliability, leaving them instead with the message that we value economic deals more than their safety. And a diminished U.S. presence in each of the aforementioned regions – the East China Sea, the Korean Peninsula, and the South China Sea – could compromise our allies' strongholds there. Up Next China thinks it can push the United States and its allies out of Asia altogether to secure its energy riches for itself. Thanks to a small $6 U.S. defense contractor with top-secret technology, the Pentagon has a plan to stop China dead in its tracks. Click here for the full briefing.

Bezos, who is worth $75 billion, said he expects to spend $2.5 billion to develop a rocket that can lift satellites – and eventually people – into orbit. Eleven-minute rides for space tourists are planned to start next year, he said, with an eye toward making the company a profitable long-term business though ticket sales have yet to begin. “My business model right now for Blue Origin is that I sell about $1 billion a year of Amazon stock and I use it to invest in Blue Origin,” he said. “It’s very important that Blue Origin stand on its own feet and be a profitable, sustainable enterprise. That’s how real progress gets made.” Read: Asteroids Are Flying Past Earth More Often Than Usual Virgin Galactic is selling space tourism tickets for $250,000, which includes three days of training and a 2 1/2 hour flight, while NASA got a deal from SpaceX for flights to the moon, $74.7 million for five astronauts. Russian space tourist Dennis Tito bought a ticket aboard a Russian Soyuz spacecraft in 2001 for a reported $20 million. Bezos told reporters he wants to make space travel as common as airline flights, hoping to bring the cost down by 99 percent with the use of reusable rockets, the Colorado Springs, Colorado, Gazette reported.

To make that model work, we have to do other things, so satellite customers will cover some of the costs in the early innings," Bezos said. "The demand for this will be up to the customers. I have thrown plenty of parties that no one came to, but I don't think that will be case." Unlike Elon Musk’s SpaceX, which plans to go to Mars, Blue Origin will focus on sub-orbital flights, Bezos said. He said his space tourists will need only an hour of training before flight. "I want to see an entrepreneurial explosion in space," he said. "Most things you now do in space have a high cost of admission. If we can reduce the cost of launch by a factor of 10 or 100, it will be a completely new world -- a golden age of space exploration." Blue Origin had been planning to start testing crewed flights this year, but that probably won’t happen, SpaceNews reported. blue originMore Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos is hoping the New Shepard space craft will begin 11-minute tourist flights next year.

Downing/Reuters “We’re going to go through the test program, and we’ll put humans on it when we’re happy,” he said. “I don’t think it’s going to be 2017 at this point. It could be.” Bezos said there’s no rigid schedule for development of the New Shepard propulsion system, and he’s constantly reminding his team they’re not involved in a race. “This vehicle is going to carry humans. We’re going to make it as safe as we can make it,” he said. “We’re not going to take any shortcuts. We’re going to put humans on this vehicle when we’re ready and not a second sooner.” The New Shepard crew capsule was on display at the symposium. It has six seats in a horizontal position, large windows and computer monitors. Passengers will be able to float around the cabin for about 4 minutes during a typical flight. Adding a second stage would allow the rocket to put small satellites into orbit although the company’s New Glenn vehicle is the more likely candidate for such duty, Bezos said.

Public Services and Procurement Minister Judy Foote will be away until further notice, Ottawa said. Her duties will be performed by Natural Resources Minister Jim Carr, who is also staying in his current job. In 2014, Foote announced she was fighting breast cancer for the second time. Foote, 64, unveiled plans last year to buy 18 Boeing Corp Super Hornets as a stop-gap measure while Ottawa prepares an open five-year competition to buy new jets. Canada's Liberal government opted for the Boeing jets despite being a member of a consortium that helped fund development of Lockheed Martin Corp's F-35 stealth fighter, which has been hit by repeated delays. Lockheed said it was disappointed by the decision.

Home Mail Flickr Tumblr News Sports Finance Celebrity Answers Groups Mobile More Yahoo Search Search Skip to Navigation Skip to Main Content Skip to Related Content 0 News Home Follow Us US World Politics Tech Science Odd News ABC News Yahoo Originals Katie Couric Matt Bai Twitter refuses U.S. order to reveal user behind anti-Trump account By David Ingram ReutersApril 6, 2017 Reblog Share Tweet Share The logo for the parody immigration Twitter account @alt_uscis, the subject of administrative summons from the U.S. government to social media company Twitter, is seen in a screenshot taken April 6, 2017. @alt_uscis/Handout via ReutersMore By David Ingram SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Twitter Inc on Thursday filed a federal lawsuit to block an order by the U.S. government demanding that it reveal who is behind an account opposed to President Donald Trump's tough immigration policies. Citing freedom of speech as a basis for not turning over records, Twitter filed the lawsuit in federal court in San Francisco and said that the account, @ALT_uscis, claimed to be run by at least one federal immigration employee. The acronym CIS refers to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, and the account describes itself as "immigration resistance." Trump has vowed to build a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico and has promised to deport millions of illegal immigrants. Following Trump's inauguration in January, anonymous Twitter feeds that borrowed the names and logos of more than a dozen U.S. government agencies appeared to challenge the president's views on climate change and other issues. A Twitter spokesman declined to comment on whether the government demanded information about other accounts critical of Trump. Twitter, which counts Trump among its active users, has a record of litigating in favor of user privacy. "The rights of free speech afforded Twitter's users and Twitter itself under the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution include a right to disseminate such anonymous or pseudonymous political speech," Twitter said in the lawsuit. (http://tmsnrt.rs/2p6CnXp) The U.S. Department of Homeland Security, which is a defendant in the lawsuit, declined to comment on pending litigation. The Justice Department, which typically represents federal agencies in court, also declined to comment. Esha Bhandari, a staff attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union, which is representing the Twitter user in the case, said the government's request was highly unusual. Requests for social media account information from the U.S. government typically involve national security or criminal charges, she said. "We have seen no reason the government has given for seeking to unmask this speaker's identity," Bhandari said, adding that the right to anonymous speech against the government is "a bedrock American value" strongly protected under the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. Shortly after the lawsuit became public, @ALT_uscis tweeted a copy of the First Amendment and a picture of part of the lawsuit to its 61,000 followers, an increase of about 28,000 in a few hours. For weeks the account has posted criticism of the administration. It tweeted a parody of the game "bingo" for "right-wing idiots," said that some anti-immigration advocates must have been dropped on their head at birth, and mocked Trump for not giving more of his wealth to charities. Twitter said it received an administrative summons last month demanding that it provide records related to the account. (http://tmsnrt.rs/2oKlWnk) A copy of the summons filed with the lawsuit says the records are needed for an investigation to ensure compliance with duties, taxes and fines and other customs and immigration matters. It was not immediately clear how the anonymous account fit into those laws and regulations, and Twitter might have a strong case that the summons was improper, said Paul Alan Levy, staff attorney at Public Citizen Litigation Group who specializes in online privacy and free speech issues. "I don't think there is any way for the government to come out of this looking good," Levy said. The lawsuit may also be savvy public relations for Twitter, said Jane Kirtley, law and journalism professor at the University of Minnesota. “Twitter and other social media sites make promises to users about protecting anonymity. This is a way for Twitter to say, ‘See, we are standing up for your rights,’” Kirtley said. The social media company has a history of challenging government demands for information on its users, including a 2012 demand from New York prosecutors about an Occupy Wall Street protester. In that case, Twitter was forced to hand over tweets from the protester to a judge who threatened the company with sanctions, and the protester pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct. Twitter sued the U.S. Department of Justice in 2014, seeking permission to publicly disclose more information about requests it gets from U.S. authorities for information about its users. The lawsuit was partly dismissed last year. Among the lawyers representing Twitter in the latest case is Seth Waxman, a former high-ranking Justice Department official under President Bill Clinton.

Gleason US 22:00 06.04.2017(updated 02:52 07.04.2017) Get short URL 21074211 A Pentagon spokesman says that the department’s $36-billion ground-based missile defense system may conduct its first intercept test in three years, come late May. The tentative testing comes as North Korea and its leader Kim Jong-un continue ballistic missile launches and nuclear weapons testing. "Although North Korea is not an existential threat," the isolated country is "the most dangerous and unpredictable actor in the Pacific region," according to comments from Air Force Gen. John Hyten, head of the US Strategic Command (StratCom), to a Senate panel this week.  © REUTERS/ KCNA US-China Summit: North Korea Divisions Cast Shadow The defense system is managed by Boeing, with interceptors in California at Vandenberg Air Force Base and in Alaska at Fort Greely. According to Missile Defense Agency, the Pentagon’s test will include an avionics update to an Orbital ATK Inc.-made booster rocket containing a conventional warhead. Hyten told lawmakers, "Pyongyang’s evolving ballistic missile and nuclear weapons program underscore the growing threat" as they are "also pursuing development of Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) and Submarine Launched Ballistic Missiles capabilities, and an improved Intermediate Range Ballistic Missile," according to Bloomberg. Amid ongoing threats from the DPRK (Democratic People’s Republic of Korea), responding to joint military drills between the US and South Korea, US President Donald Trump has accused the country of behaving "very very badly," and the issue will likely be a central piece of discussion in his meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping Thursday and Friday. Trump has accused China of not taking an active enough role in addressing provocation from the North, while Beijing maintains it has enforced sanctions against Pyongyang leveled by the United Nations.  © REUTERS/ KCNA US General: Preemptive Strike May Be 'Only Option Left' With North Korea In a recent interview with the Financial Times, Trump warned, "If China is not going to solve North Korea, we will. That is all I am telling you." China has its own issues with the presence of the US’ Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system in South Korea, believing the system’s radar could be used to spy on Beijing. Seoul’s military claimed this week that Pyongyang fired a missile more than 30 miles in the direction of the Sea of Japan, in continued defiance of UN sanctions and international calls for denuclearization. There are also reports that Pyongyang is trying to develop a missile topped with a nuclear warhead. During his testimony, Hyten pointed out that a similar missile North Korea tested in February utilized a new solid fuel and was fired from a mobile launcher, and that this is concerning because solid fuel projectiles are more difficult to track. "They moved what was demonstrated at sea onto land, onto a new launcher and did it in a very quick way," he said. Early estimations indicated the launch may have been the medium-range missile KN-15, also called the Pukguksong-2. South Korean officials have expressed that this latest test was deliberately timed to Xi and Trump’s upcoming meeting. ...

But with only one demonstration to show that it works so far, there’s still plenty of scope for better techniques to steal the company's thunder. Just last week, SpaceX successfully launched a refurbished rocket, putting a satellite into orbit and then landing the entire first stage again for good measure. Its long-term goal: to turn around rockets within 24 hours, so that they’re launched, landed, and relaunched again in a single day. While it’s an impressive feat, what we didn’t know then was how cost-effective the approach is. It’s perhaps not surprising, then, that the technology has proven to be a hot topic this week at the 33rd Space Symposium in Colorado Springs, where the great and good of the space industry have gathered to share reports of their progress. Tory Bruno, CEO of United Launch Alliance—the Lockheed Martin-Boeing collaboration that provides launch capabilities for the Department of Defense and NASA, and hasn’t yet tested rocket reuse—seems unsure that SpaceX’s approach is definitely the right one. According to the Financial Times (paywall), he explained at the event that the approach is “not necessarily a giant game-changing alteration to the cost basis.” Then, speaking to Florida Today, he said that “the jury’s still out on what is the best way” to recycle rockets. SpaceX would beg to differ. According to its president, Gwynne Shotwell, the cost of refurbishing and reusing a previously flown booster using its approach was “substantially less than half” as much as the cost of using a new one. And things should improve further: she added that the company had to do “way more on this one than we’re doing on future ones." Elon Musk was quick to point out that those savings won’t be passed on to customers looking to use the services of SpaceX. Pegging investment into reusable rockets so far at a cool $1 billion, he said that pricing discounts would be adjusted so that the company was able “to repay the massive development costs.” Musk explained after last week’s successful reuse that he believed launch companies that weren’t offering reusable rockets would be left dead in the water. He’s likely to be right—but that doesn’t mean that his company’s approach is the right one. For its part, United Launch Alliance is currently looking into ways to make use of components more than once. But unlike SpaceX, it plans to recover the booster engines attached to either side of its Vulcan rocket, rather than the entire first stage. It claims that approach will be more cost-effective. Meanwhile Blue Origin, the space company owned by Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, is also trying its hand at recycling rockets, though its approach is similar to that of SpaceX. This kind of competitive innovation, seemingly played out on the scale of months, is somewhat of a departure for the space industry, which has tended to move more slowly in the past. And while SpaceX has stolen an early lead, that doesn’t guarantee victory. “It’s not obvious how it will turn out, and that’s why people are trying different things,” said Bruno, again speaking to Florida Today. “We’re going to find out who’s right, and that’s kind of the beauty of competition.” One thing that is certain, though, is that the commercial space race has firmly arrived—along with much of the Silicon Valley-style jostling and swagger that some of its insurgents know so very well.

Stationed in Geilenkirchen, in west Germany near the Dutch border, the NATO Airborne Warning and Control System planes are registered as Luxembourg aircraft, with LX registration on  their tails. Photo: Alice Steyer-Fonck The large radar is the key characteristic of the E-3 Sentry AWACS, manufactured by Boeing, and the noise they make, including a loud whistling sound, might have surprised unsuspecting pedestrians in areas near the airport on Thursday.   The planes usually operate at an altitude of 9,500 metres from where they can survey the airspace in a perimeter of over 400 kilometres. This is by no means the first time AWACS planes have been spotted over Luxembourg and about two years ago local aviation photographer Felix Reuter, was able to capture them on video (below) landing and taking off and Findel airport.

GeekWire’s Alan Boyle sits in one of the padded seats inside a mock-up of the crew capsule for Blue Origin’s suborbital spaceship. The door of the capsule’s hatch is just to the right of Boyle’s head. (GeekWire Photo / Kevin Lisota) COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. – The seats in Blue Origin’s suborbital spaceship are like a dentist’s chair that’s fully extended, with a big difference. You can float out of this one when weightlessness sets in. Of course, we couldn’t get the zero-G experience when we tried out the seats in a mock-up of the New Shepard crew capsule, on display here at the 33rd Space Symposium. But we did get a condensed version of the 11-minute flight scenario, from launch to landing. Our guide for the sit-in was Ariane Cornell, a member of Blue Origin’s strategy and business development team. Five other journalists and I ducked our heads, stepped through the hatch and settled into the six seats placed around the periphery of a cabin that’s about the size and shape of a big igloo. The interior was designed for Blue Origin with input from Seattle-based Teague, which also designed the cabin for Boeing’s 787 Dreamliner jet. The overall vibe is similar to what you see in a Dreamliner, right down to the cool-blue mood lighting in the cushioned walls. Blue Origin’s flight plan calls for six passengers to board the capsule at T-minus-30, strap themselves in and brace themselves for launch. Padding can be added to the seats to accommodate different body shapes. If you’re extra-tall, just bend your legs a little more when you put your feet on the footrests. “The best way here is to take a seat and then swing your legs over,” Cornell told us. Each of us had a roughly 4-foot-tall window to look through, with a display screen about the size of an Amazon Kindle Fire tablet mounted on the window’s edge. During a real spaceflight, that tablet would display views from external cameras, plus flight data for the passengers’ edification. A fisheye camera is mounted at the top of the space igloo’s ceiling. In flight, that will provide an internal view, not only for the passengers aboard the autonomously piloted capsule, but for Mission Control as well. If you don’t have your seat belt fastened properly, you’ll get a radioed reminder. Other cameras will be placed strategically around the cabin to take selfies automatically. Right beneath the fisheye, there’s a dark cylinder that looks like a table for cocktails. But don’t set a drink down on this tabletop: It’s actually the housing for a solid-rocket motor that would fire up to power the capsule away from the booster below in the event of an emergency during ascent. The system was successfully tested last October during an uncrewed flight. Blue Origin’s New Shepard suborbital rocket booster stands on display at the Space symposium. If you look closely at lower left, you can make out five tortoises that have been painted on the rocket – one tortoise for each trip to space. (GeekWire Photo / Kevin Lisota) Passengers will feel about 3 G’s of acceleration on the way up, and at the top of the ride, they’ll get about four minutes of zero-G. There’s enough room to float free and do a Superman pose. But when you turn a somersault, be careful not to hit your fellow passengers. “Zero-G etiquette will be part of the training,” Cornell said. Read more: How Jeff Bezos is using Amazon’s success to fuel Blue Origin, a billion dollars at a time A countdown displayed in big numbers on your tablet will alert you to get back in your seat for the roller-coaster descent, which can deliver up to 5.5 G’s of acceleration. Parachutes will slow down the 8,000-pound capsule, and just before landing, a burst from the retro-thruster system will take some of the “bump” out of the touchdown. Commercial service could begin as early as 2018. The ticket price hasn’t yet been set, and it’s too soon to make reservations. But not too soon for Blue Origin to start thinking about repeat customers. “I’m sure, as soon as people go up and they come back down, they’re going to want to do it again,” Cornell said. “And we’ll be ready for them.” Love space and science? Sign up for our GeekWire Space & Science email newsletter for top headlines from Alan Boyle, GeekWire’s aerospace and science editor.

The Washington Post picked the wrong day to look as… » April 6, 2017 QUESTION ASKED: Can USAF Afford To Retire F-15 C/D Eagle? The U.S. Air Force has invested years of work and hundreds of millions of dollars in keeping Boeing’s F-15C fleet flying well into the 2040s. But Lt. Gen. Scott Rice, director of the Air National Guard (ANG), recently shocked the aerospace community when he revealed the service is now thinking seriously about sunsetting the iconic Eagle two decades early. Faced with tight budgets, the Air Force is desperately looking for ways to cut costs in order to invest in new capabilities. To keep the 1970s-era Eagle flying beyond the late 2020s, the service would likely need to spend $30-40 million per aircraft—an investment that may not be worth the price, officials say. The Air Force probably cannot afford to repair the F-15 fleet while simultaneously bringing online new fifth- and sixth-generation aircraft such as the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter (JSF), B-21 stealth bomber and new Penetrating Counterair (PCA) fighter, the head of Air Combat Command, Gen. Mike Holmes, tells Aviation Week. But at a time when Russia and China are pumping out large numbers of highly capable fourth-generation fighters, can the Air Force really afford to retire over 200 Eagles? We’ve enjoyed air supremacy long enough that we take it for granted.

Carlton Everhart: USAF Tankers Need Protection From Enemy Radar Via ‘Cloaking’ Tech Jane Edwards April 6, 2017 Latest News, Tech & Cyber 38 Views Gen. Carlton Everhart, head of the Air Mobility Command, has said he has asked the Defense Department’s new innovation office and defense contractors to offer ideas for a new electronic “cloaking” device for the U.S. Air Force’s fleet of aerial refueling aircraft, Bloomberg reported Wednesday. Anthony Capaccio writes Everhart told Bloomberg in a Tuesday interview that he wants the service branch’s Boeing-built KC-46, KC-135 and other aerial tankers to be equipped with a cloaking tool designed to reduce the profiles or change the waveform of such aircraft in order to make them invisible to adversaries’ radar systems. He said he also wants the aerial refueling planes to have laser platforms that will work to target ground-to-air missiles and that he intends to move eight Lockheed Martin-built C-5M transport aircraft to flying status through additional funds from the Trump administration’s proposed defense budget for fiscal 2018. Everhart also noted that he will hold a conference with officials from commercial airlines, Air Force Reserve and National Guard on May 18 in Maryland to discuss ways on how to hire and train new airmen to address the pilot shortage, the report added.

(Photo: Randall Hill/Reuters/Newscom) Commentary By Diane Katz / @Dianeskatz Diane Katz, who has analyzed and written on public policy issues for more than two decades, is a research fellow in regulatory policy at The Heritage Foundation. Read her research. The annual conference of the Export-Import Bank begins Thursday, which is an opportune time to catch up with the federal agency that doles out billions of dollars in subsidies to benefit foreign governments and titans of industry. Of particular interest are transaction details that the bank won’t reveal, as well as its relatively limp support for small business. Over at the bank’s downtown District of Columbia headquarters, most everyone is concerned about what President Donald Trump will do. The Ex-Im charter is authorized through September 2019, but there are three vacancies on the five-seat board of directors. The lack of a quorum limits the size of bank deals to $10 million or less, including export loans and loan guarantees as well as capital and credit insurance. (That’s how it is supposed to work, in any event.) Ex-Im opponents are hoping that the president will, at the very least, maintain the status quo—although the best course of action would be to eliminate the bank altogether. (More on that below.) But the Ex-Im lobby is pushing for Trump to nominate board candidates and negotiate their Senate confirmation. Doing so would free up billions of dollars in subsidies for Boeing Co., General Electric Co., Caterpillar, and the like—that is, multinational corporations that do not lack access to capital and which can finance exports without taxpayer handouts. On the other hand, Congress could—at least conceivably—exercise leadership and phase the bank out of existence. It is not as if there is a shortage of private export financing: U.S. exports totaled $2.2 trillion in fiscal year 2016, with Ex-Im supporting just 0.22 percent ($5 billion). Who benefitted from that $5 billion? Ex-Im officials are keeping mum, although the transactions are supposed to be public. But if allowed to operate in secret, citizens and their representatives in Congress cannot determine whether the bank is complying with the $10 million transaction limit or with the other rules it has violated in the past. The Heritage Foundation made repeated requests in the past five weeks for information on 48 transactions in fiscal year 2016 that far exceeded the $10 million limit. For example, both JPMorgan Chase & Co. and TD Bank, N.A. were awarded a whopping $500 million on Dec. 14, 2015, and Wells Fargo & Co. was awarded $200 million on the same day. Several others were awarded between $15 million and $150 million. According to Ex-Im officials, some of the awards in question represent taxpayer-backed insurance for U.S. banks that issue letters of credit used overseas to finance foreign firms’ purchases of American exports. However, Ex-Im’s public database does not identify the borrowers or exporters, products or countries, involved in at least half of those 48 transactions, and multiple requests for details were in vain. Ex-Im representatives claim that prior boards of directors have authorized bank staff to unilaterally approve short-term transactions that exceed $10 million. But they also said that individual transactions under this so-called delegated authority are subject to limits of $10 million for corporate entities, $25 million for financial institutions, and $35 million for sovereign entities. Alas, without transaction details, neither Congress nor the public can determine whether the awards of $500 million, $200 million, $150 million, and the like were proper. Also in fiscal year 2016, there were five transactions listed in the bank database as approved by the board—although there was no board quorum to approve deals at the time. Borrower Lender Amount Program Zeeco Inc. J.P. Morgan Chase $72 million Working Capital Loan Thrustmaster of Texas ZB, National Association $27 million Working Capital Loan Jyoti Americas, Llc. Cadence Bank $18.9 million Working Capital Loan Frontier Spinning Mills PNC Bank $13.5 million Working Capital Loan Aeromexico Banco Nacional do Mexico $10.2 million Medium-term Loan Guarantee According to a bank representative, the working capital loans were approved by the board when a quorum existed, and represent installments of multiyear authorizations. However, the decision dates for the four transactions are listed as fiscal year 2016, and prior entries for the same companies do not indicate a multiyear authorization. The one medium-term transaction, for Aeromexico, refers to an amendment to a transaction approved by the board in 2014, according to an Ex-Im representative. The nature of the amendment is unknown, although the representative did say that Ex-Im staff exercised their (supposed) delegated authority to approve the (supposedly proper) amendment. Throughout the two-year debate over reauthorization of the Ex-Im charter, proponents incessantly claimed that small business was the bank’s “core mission.” That simply wasn’t true. Just 20 percent or less of total financing went to small businesses. But lacking a quorum, and thus barred from dispensing billions of dollars in export subsidies to the big guys, one might think that bank officials would maximize its small-business assistance. But that didn’t happen. The bank reported $2.7 billion in authorizations to benefit small business in fiscal year 2016, which was about half of the level of small-business support from two years before. Obviously, they aren’t banging down Ex-Im’s door for help. The vast majority of small-business exporters do not need—and do not receive—taxpayer subsidies. Indeed, small businesses ranked “exporting my products/services” as the least problematic of 75 business problems assessed in an annual survey by the National Federation of Independent Business Research Foundation. The cost of health care ranked as the most severe problem. The debate about Ex-Im isn’t about helping small business. It is about the powerful bond between big business and big government. Ex-Im subsidies are neither the biggest nor worst manifestation of corporate welfare. But change in Washington is tortuous, and ending Ex-Im is a practical and rational target at present for reasons both material and ideological. Despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary, some members of Congress believe that a few legislative tweaks will remedy all that is wrong with the bank. Ex-Im officials have thwarted past attempts by Congress to impose reforms. More importantly, no amount of bureaucratic tinkering can shield taxpayers from bailouts in the event that bank reserves run dry—as occurred in the 1980s—nor will it protect American businesses from the disadvantages of the U.S. government subsidizing their foreign competitors. There isn’t an economist alive who could coherently argue that Ex-Im subsidies don’t distort credit and labor markets—and always to the detriment of those who remain independent of the welfare state. That is why Trump and Congress must eliminate the bank, both to prove that cronyism can be restrained, and because it would most benefit the nation.

The range of feedstock is vast, and in the four years to 2015, more than 20 airlines have made over 2500 commercial passenger flights with blends of up to 50 per cent biofuel. READ MORE: • Plan to power aircraft with trash The quest for a replacement for the traditional kerosene-based jet fuel took flight in February, 2008, when Virgin Atlantic became the first airline to fly a commercial airliner with biofuel. The airline used a mixture of coconut and babassu oil in one of the four main fuel tanks of a jumbo jet. Later that year Air New Zealand flew a Boeing 747 with a 50/50 mix of jatropha biofuel and conventional jet fuel for two hours, and successfully completed a series of performance tests. Since then, both airlines have started the long chase for new sources of alternative fuel. But commercial scale jet biofuel remains a work in progress - timetables for its introduction tend to blow out by years. According to International Air Transport Association figures, as of last year there were five production pathways technically certified and another 16 on the drawing board. But so far, the quantity of biofuel produced is only a drop in the bucket, compared with the 1.5 billion barrels of jet fuel used every year. Continued below. Related Content Brian Fallow: Cut the livestock, grow more trees Z Energy hopes to start producing biofuel soon after months of delays Video Air travel set to get greener Producing commercial quantities of biofuel - and importantly, being able to pump it through existing infrastructure - is becoming more pressing. Most of the airline industry has signed up to ambitious targets. From 2020, any increase in airline CO2 emissions will need to be offset by activities such as tree planting, to soak up the carbon dioxide aircraft pump into the atmosphere at the rate of close to 800,000 tonnes a year. The United Nations' International Civil Aviation Organisation estimates the agreement would cost airlines between US$5.3 billion ($7.5b) and US$23.9 billion annually by 2035. Emissions from international flights - the main source of such pollution - account for about 2 per cent of global greenhouse gases and are forecast to triple by 2050. Biofuels have been shown to reduce the carbon footprint of aviation fuel by up to 80 per cent over their full life cycle. If commercial aviation were to get just 6 per cent of its fuel supply from biofuel by 2020, this would reduce its overall carbon footprint by 5 per cent. Last year, more than 60 nations representing over 80 per cent of aviation traffic pledged to voluntarily participate in the system when it begins in 2020, including the United States, China and most of Europe. The deal, which has drawn criticism from India and Russia, becomes mandatory for most nations in 2027. Despite the cost, companies said a single international standard would be cheaper and easier to follow than a jumble of programmes implemented by different countries. Fuel is the biggest single cost for airlines, and while the latest generation planes are up to 20 per cent more efficient than the aircraft they replace, and optimal flight paths can play a big role, biofuel is seen as a the only energy solution to mitigate the industry's emissions growth in the medium term. Bjorn Heijstra from LanzaTech with a bottle of ethanol made from steel manufacturing waste gas. Unlike ground transport, which is rapidly shifting to battery technology, aviation has no alternative to liquid fuels. IATA estimates that electric commercial aircraft are unlikely before 2040, when battery weight and safety issues could be solved. "The main challenges to a wide deployment of alternative jet fuels are not technical but commercial and political," says IATA. "Currently a number of alternative jet fuel production pathways are more expensive than fossil JetA/A1." Relatively depressed oil prices over the past 18 months are also working against biofuel development. It is estimated that ethanol made from corn, one of the cheapest of the alternatives, becomes cost competitive when oil prices rise past US$65 a barrel. They've been around US$50 or less for much of the past year, hitting the higher mark only for a short time in 2015. And biofuel has hit other structural roadblocks. Air New Zealand was not the only airline interested in jatropha, a plant which grows in tropical and subtropical regions. Investors piled in around 2007 and 2008, investing in huge plantations. But it was found that, though the plant could grow in arid conditions, it needed more fertile soils and better irrigation to produce the oil-rich seeds required for biofuel, therefore pitching it into competition with crops grown for large populations in those regions. Food crops such as corn, sugarcane, soybeans, palm oil and sugarbeet have also been used for biofuel - mainly used in ground transport - and likewise have competed with food production. Air New Zealand, with Virgin Australia, is now searching for alternatives and the airlines are upbeat about the prospects of producing aviation biofuel locally, following their year-long joint investigation. The airlines have completed an extensive review of more than 30 responses received from organisations in this country, Australia, the US, Canada and Europe. They will now work with short-listed companies on strengthening the commercial case for investment following the request for information.

Air New Zealand's head of sustainability, Lisa Daniell, says the airlines achieved their key objectives in testing market readiness and gaining a better understanding of potential supply opportunities. "The [request for information] has helped stimulate industry dialogue on the production of sustainable aviation fuel in the Australasian region. Importantly, the process has also greatly expanded our understanding of the technologies and processes involved and the potential timeframes to scale up to the volumes required," she says. In this country, Z Energy is developing a plant in Wiri that makes biodiesel from animal fat and is leading the pack here, having produced a large test batch before Christmas. David Binnie, general manager of supply and distribution at Z Energy, says alternative aviation fuel will be a long game for those who want to get into the field. He says some of the building blocks of biodiesel technology are transferable. "If we chose to adapt the biodiesel plant to something else, there's still some unknowns about that." The growth in flying - at a time when battery power will increasingly replace liquid fuel in ground transport - means there is big scope in the long term. "It's really high potential in terms of the scale of it," says Binnie. "On the jet stuff, we're just embarking on that journey but in the next six months to a year we'll make some choices on that." Another New Zealand company, LanzaTech, is at the forefront of a pioneering technology in partnership with Virgin Atlantic. It was founded in New Zealand but is now based in the United States and has a production facility in China where it has already produced a batch of 5700 litres of jet fuel derived from waste industrial gases from steel mills, using a fermentation process. The airline hopes to run its first proving flight this year following work with Boeing and a range of other industry players. - NZ Herald Read more by Grant Bradley Email Grant Bradley Email Print Get the news delivered straight to your inbox Receive the day’s news, sport and entertainment in our daily email newsletter SIGN UP NOW Loading Currency Compare and convert world currencies.

Bezos, who is worth $75 billion, said he expects to spend $2.5 billion to develop a rocket that can lift satellites – and eventually people – into orbit. Eleven-minute rides for space tourists are planned to start next year, he said, with an eye toward making the company a profitable long-term business though ticket sales have yet to begin. “My business model right now for Blue Origin is that I sell about $1 billion a year of Amazon stock and I use it to invest in Blue Origin,” he said. “It’s very important that Blue Origin stand on its own feet and be a profitable, sustainable enterprise. That’s how real progress gets made.” Read: Asteroids Are Flying Past Earth More Often Than Usual Virgin Galactic is selling space tourism tickets for $250,000, which includes three days of training and a 2 1/2 hour flight, while NASA got a deal from SpaceX for flights to the moon, $74.7 million for five astronauts. Russian space tourist Dennis Tito bought a ticket aboard a Russian Soyuz spacecraft in 2001 for a reported $20 million. Bezos told reporters he wants to make space travel as common as airline flights, hoping to bring the cost down by 99 percent with the use of reusable rockets, the Colorado Springs, Colorado, Gazette reported. Read: Boeing Unveils Concept Images For Cislunar Habitat, Deep Space Transport Vehicle "My singular focus is to have people in space. To make that model work, we have to do other things, so satellite customers will cover some of the costs in the early innings," Bezos said. "The demand for this will be up to the customers. I have thrown plenty of parties that no one came to, but I don't think that will be case." Unlike Elon Musk’s SpaceX, which plans to go to Mars, Blue Origin will focus on sub-orbital flights, Bezos said. He said his space tourists will need only an hour of training before flight. "I want to see an entrepreneurial explosion in space," he said. "Most things you now do in space have a high cost of admission. If we can reduce the cost of launch by a factor of 10 or 100, it will be a completely new world -- a golden age of space exploration." Blue Origin had been planning to start testing crewed flights this year, but that probably won’t happen, SpaceNews reported. Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos is hoping the New Shepard space craft will begin 11-minute tourist flights next year.

Downing/Reuters “We’re going to go through the test program, and we’ll put humans on it when we’re happy,” he said. “I don’t think it’s going to be 2017 at this point. It could be.” Bezos said there’s no rigid schedule for development of the New Shepard propulsion system, and he’s constantly reminding his team they’re not involved in a race. “This vehicle is going to carry humans. We’re going to make it as safe as we can make it,” he said. “We’re not going to take any shortcuts. We’re going to put humans on this vehicle when we’re ready and not a second sooner.” The New Shepard crew capsule was on display at the symposium. It has six seats in a horizontal position, large windows and computer monitors. Passengers will be able to float around the cabin for about 4 minutes during a typical flight. Adding a second stage would allow the rocket to put small satellites into orbit although the company’s New Glenn vehicle is the more likely candidate for such duty, Bezos said.

Some 300 miles north in Huntsville, new businesses sprout in farm fields drawn by readily available land, low taxes, flexible labor rules and improving infrastructure. As President Trump faces pressure to deliver on his promise to revive manufacturing in the northern "rust belt" states that put him in the White House, his biggest challenge may not be Mexico or China, but the southern U.S. states that form the other pillar of his political base. States like Alabama have built a presence in the global supply chain in direct competition with the country's Midwestern industrial heartland, and even if Trump coaxes jobs back to the United States they may well head south rather than north. Whether the "rust belt's" expectations are met will be central to 2018 U.S. mid-term elections and likely frame the presidential race in 2020. The southern states are reliably Republican, but the party's ability to repeat its success in Midwestern swing states, such as Michigan, Ohio and Wisconsin, may hinge on whether the Trump administration delivers on its economic promises. For a decade now, nine southern states - North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Tennessee, Kentucky, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, and Texas - together have accounted for a larger share of the U.S. economy than nine northern states that defined America as the 20th century's industrial superpower, according to a Reuters analysis of federal data. The analysis compared gross domestic product, population and other factors among northern and Midwestern states that played a key role in Trump's victory or are typically considered part of the industrial heartland, with those in the south and along the Gulf Coast that have become an emerging destination for auto and other investment. (For graphic on' A battle for jobs' click: http://tmsnrt.rs/2nHSda5) Florida, a state whose population has boomed under an influx of retirees, many of them from the north, was excluded. FREE LAND AND DEGREES Economists and industrial site consultants say the reasons behind the trend have moved beyond lower wages and lower levels of unionization. Per capita income in the south has now almost caught up with that in the Midwest, and its skilled workforce continues to grow as college graduates move in. "Labor? Perceived advantages. Taxes? Some of these are fairly low (tax) states. Real estate? For big projects that are going to employ three, four, five thousand people, you can find free land - zero cost land," said Darin Buelow, an industrial site specialist with Deloitte Consulting. In the south, business executives and development officials interviewed by Reuters were less likely to call for new tariffs and trade deals than to worry about how any new regime may disrupt a system they have learned to work with. David Fernandes, president of Toyota Motor Manufacturing Alabama, said that of the roughly 700,000 engines the factory made last year, half went to Mexico and Canada. The facility also makes engines for cars assembled at a Toyota plant in Georgetown, Kentucky. "Anything that hinders the opportunity to provide product to a customer is what is concerning," he said. Plants in Kentucky and Indiana gave Toyota a U.S. foothold in the 1980s and 1990s, but in this century the Japanese carmaker turned to Alabama, Texas and Mississippi for expansion. Located on former cotton fields, the company's Huntsville, Alabama, plant now employs more than 1,400 people and churns out about 3,000 engines a day. Gunmaker Remington Outdoor came to Huntsville lured by US$110 million in tax and other concessions. Its factory here is expected to eventually employ 2,000, and it has already begun shifting employees from elsewhere, including 100 from the town in upstate New York where the company was founded two centuries ago. Jeremy Littlejohn moved his cloud computing start-up RISC Networks from Chicago to Asheville, NC, in 2012 for the less hectic pace, but has found the location a selling point as he grew from 6 to 33 employees. Many of those new workers came from out of state, contributing to North Carolina's net annual influx of about 46,000 college degree holders. That migration of educated workers is the norm among the southern states. The rust belt by contrast saw a net outflow of more than 400,000 residents with college degrees between 2007 and 2014. The customers are heading south too. From 1990 to 2015, population in the nine southern and gulf states grew 43 percent, to more than 76 million, and passed that of the rust belt states in the late 1990s. Population in the rust belt grew 13 percent, to 63 million, over the same period. When the Minnesota-based Polaris Industries Inc. began planning a new facility for its line of outdoor vehicles, "there was no Minnesota play," said Eric Blackwell, director of operations at the company's new factory outside Huntsville. The market for Polaris' machines, popular for farm work, hunting and sport riding, was growing in the south. Open land was available, and Alabama had programs to help recruit and train a workforce expected to rise to 1,500. FROM LAGGARD TO A RISING TIDE Globalization hit both the north and the south hard. Between 2000 and 2010 each lost about a third of their manufacturing jobs. But employment rebounded faster and more broadly in the south. Between 2000 and 2015, combined private sector employment in nine southern and gulf coast states still grew 13.5 percent. In the nine northern states total private sector jobs as of 2015 remained 1.3 percent below their 2000 level, according to federal data. The transition dates back to the 1980s, when German and Japanese automakers began investing in what has become a sprawling, regional industry. Supplier networks followed, creating even stiffer competition in an industry already changing due to passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and the growth of automaking in Mexico. New industries, such as aerospace, followed. Boeing opened a new factory in Charleston, South Carolina, while decades of federal spending on space and defense programs created a pool of engineers in Alabama. A surge in energy and locally important industries like wood products added to the employment gains. Judith Adams, vice president at the Alabama State Port Authority, speeds visitors through warehouses of wood fiber products, steel ingots and other goods ready to ship abroad. The port is spending US$47 million to boost its capacity to 500,000 containers a year from 300,000. The longer-term the goal is to triple that to 1.5 million. "The vessel sizes are getting bigger. The market is getting bigger. The cargo is here," Adams said. When European aircraft maker Airbus scouted sites for its US$600 million North American plant more than a decade ago it settled on a former Air Force base in Mobile. As it ramps up production, local officials say 20 suppliers have already arrived in Airbus' wake, with firms like Ireland's Maas Aviation looking to put 150 people to work painting planes. "We looked at transportation costs, labor costs, productivity, and it made sense," said Allan McArtor, chief executive of Airbus Group Inc. "We will be building single aisle airplanes (in Mobile) for a long, long time."

The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.07%  gained 14.80 points to finish at 20,662.95. On Wednesday the blue-chip index went from a 200-point gain to finish down 0.2%, the benchmark’s biggest blown lead since February 2016. The Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, +0.25%  climbed 14.47 points, or 0.3%, to end at 5,878.95. Thursday’s action follows the biggest one-day reversal for equities in more than a year in the previous session, which was triggered in part by the Federal Reserve’s admission that it will start unwinding its balance sheet sooner than expected. “We are seeing a short-term snap back from yesterday’s sharp selloff with the hardest-hit sectors recovering,” said Frank Cappelleri, chartered market technician at Instinet. The Dow and the Nasdaq briefly traded in negative territory during the session Thursday after Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said the U.S. government is considering an “appropriate response” to Syria’s chemical attacks. Tillerson also hinted at the possibility of removing Syrian President Bashar Assad from power, stating that his actions suggest “there would be no role for him to govern the Syrian people,” CNBC reported. But for most of the day, the market trended higher as investors looked for bargains following Wednesday’s selloff. “We are seeing rotational buying as funds move around. Every time the market dips, investors come back,” said Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Asset Management. Trump’s trade promises on the line with China(3:35) U.S. President Donald Trump promises tough trade negotiations this week with Chinese President Xi Jinping to stop American job losses. What’s at stake in Mar-a-Lago? Investors are closely watching the Trump-Xi summit amid some concerns that the two-day meeting could end in acrimonious fashion, spooking global financial markets. Read: Why investors are fretting over the Trump-Xi meeting And see: Trump’s meeting with China’s Xi could have a lasting impact on the dollar However, Julian Evans-Pritchard, China economist at Capital Economics, suggested that Trump is likely to tone down his criticism of China’s trade policies to focus more on the threat from North Korea. “Xi may come offering minor concessions in order to mollify Trump, such as pledges to invest in job-creating projects in the U.S. or deals to purchase key American exports such Boeing planes,” wrote Evans-Pritchard in a note to investors. “But token gestures aside, we don’t expect any major policy announcements to come out of the meeting.” The Trump-Xi summit is somewhat overshadowing the March nonfarm-payrolls data as a focus for investors. Economists expect the monthly jobs report, due Friday, will show that job creation could slow after the two previous sharp gains. Thursday’s data on jobless claims showed the number of Americans who applied for unemployment benefits last week sank by 25,000 to 234,000, marking the second-lowest level of the current economic expansion and reflecting a tight labor market in which firms say it’s hard to find good help. On Wednesday, data on private-sector hiring showed far more jobs created than anticipated. Stocks to watch: Shares of Sunoco LP SUN, +20.24%  soared 20% after Japan-based Seven & I Holdings Co.

The idea of flying on recycled rockets became a reality a week ago when privately owned Space Exploration Technologies, or SpaceX, launched a communications satellite on a Falcon 9 booster that previously put a cargo ship into orbit for NASA. That Falcon main stage had been recovered from a successful return landing on an ocean platform shortly after its maiden flight last April, then was relaunched and salvaged again last Thursday, marking a spaceflight first. "I would be comfortable if we were to fly on a reused booster," General John "Jay" Raymond told reporters at the U.S. Space Symposium in Colorado Springs. "They've proven they can do it. ... It's going to get us to lower cost." SpaceX has so far won three launch contracts to fly military and national security satellites - business previously awarded exclusively to United Launch Alliance, a partnership of Lockheed Martin and Boeing. All those flights will take place on new Falcon 9 rockets. SpaceX, owned and operated by technology entrepreneur Elon Musk, has a backlog of more than 70 missions worth more than $10 billion. After last week's landmark launch, Musk said the company planned to fly about 20 more rockets this year, including the debut blastoff of its new heavy-lift vehicle. Up to six of those missions, including the Falcon Heavy, will use previously flown boosters, he said. Speaking at the symposium on Wednesday, SpaceX President Gwynne Shotwell said the cost of refurbishing and reflying the Falcon 9 first stage was "substantially less than half" the cost of manufacturing a new booster - the most expensive part of the rocket. SpaceX's website lists the cost of a basic Falcon 9 launch at $62 million. SpaceX expects to reduce costs even further. The company's next goal is to launch and return a rocket and relaunch it within 24 hours. "That's when we'll really feel like we've got reusability right," Shotwell said. Raymond said the Air Force would need to certify that a used booster could safely deliver its satellites into orbit. "I'm pretty comfortable we'll get comfortable with doing it," Raymond said. "This is just beginning."

Credit: Stephen Clark/Spaceflight Now Amazon.com’s Jeff Bezos, now the second-richest person in the world, is funding his space company’s lofty ambitions $1 billion per year, driving Blue Origin closer to taking paying passengers to the edge of space and fielding a reusable satellite launcher that will usher in a golden age of space exploration, the billionaire tycoon said Wednesday. Speaking in front of Blue Origin’s five-times-flown New Shepard booster at a space industry convention in Colorado Springs, Bezos said his financial backing will keep Blue Origin on course help foster a new commercial space economy made possible by cutting space transport costs. “My business model right now for Blue Origin is I sell about $1 billion per year of Amazon stock, and I use it to invest in Blue Origin,” Bezos said. “So the business model for Blue Origin is very robust.” Blue Origin is on pace to hire several hundred employees this year — its total staff now totals more than 1,000 — as the company builds a fleet of new suborbital New Shepard rockets and capsules, tests a powerful methane-fueled engine, develops the New Glenn orbital-class booster, and refines concepts for a robotic moon lander. In the long run, Bezos believes Blue Origin should be able to “stand on its own feet and be a profitable enterprise.” “That’s how real progress gets made,” Bezos said. “I do not want Blue Origin to be a not-for-profit. I want Blue Origin to be a thriving enterprise and to help open the gateway to this new generation of people who will have this dynamic entrepreneurial explosion in space. That’s what we’re going to do. “That can only be done if it’s sustaining,” Bezos said. “It’s a long road to get there, but I’m happy to invest in it.” Spaceflight Now members can read a transcript of Jeff Bezos’s question-and-answer session with reporters at the 33rd Space Symposium. Blue Origin’s spaceflight record to date is limited to the New Shepard, a single-stage rocket that has flown six times. Five of those missions used the same vehicle after the first booster was lost during a landing attempt. The first successful New Shepard landing came in November 2015, making it the first vehicle to return to Earth on rocket thrust after reaching space. A month later, SpaceX exceeded that feat by landing a larger Falcon 9 rocket booster at Cape Canaveral after sending a set of communications satellite toward orbit. Taking off and landing vertically, the New Shepard is Blue Origin’s answer to Virgin Galactic’s suborbital space plane, which fires above the Karman line — the internationally-recognized boundary of space around 62 miles (100 kilometers) above Earth — after dropping from the belly of a purpose-built carrier jet. Virgin Galactic’s spaceship glides to a runway landing after its brief trip into space. The New Shepard booster on display this week in Colorado Springs will soon be put in a museum after surviving its last flight, during which a prototype crew capsule on top of the rocket fired a solid-fueled abort motor just as it flew faster than the speed of sound, one of the most sensitive parts of any launch. The test verified the performance of an abort motor that would rapidly whisk passengers away from an exploding rocket. The capsule was expected to survive, but the New Shepard launcher was not designed to keep flying after such a maneuver.

Credit: Stephen Clark/Spaceflight Now “You can see it’s a little scarred,” Bezos said. “We have tortured this vehicle, including on its last flight, where we did a very stressing escape test.” The rocket’s BE-3 main engine continued firing, arcing on a suborbital trajectory before the booster deployed drag brakes, reignited the engine, and extended landing legs for touchdown at Bezos’s ranch near Van Horn, Texas. Blue Origin’s engineers are building a second version of the New Shepard and a human-rated crew capsule, the first of what the company says will be a fleet of reusable suborbital vehicles designed to carry six passengers into space on each flight. Late last year, Blue Origin officials hoped to put its employees on test flights of the next New Shepard booster and crew carrier by the end of 2017, followed by the launch of commercial service in 2018. Bezos said Wednesday that while he is still optimistic that New Shepard will be ready to start flying customers to space next year, the first crewed test flights are unlikely to occur before the end of 2017. “I always remind the team that we’re not racing,” Bezos said. “This vehicle is going to carry humans. We’re going to make it as safe as we can make it. We’re not going to take any shortcuts, so we’ll put humans on this vehicle when we’re ready, and not a second sooner.” Virgin Galactic founder Richard Branson told the British newspaper The Telegraph last week that he hopes his firm’s SpaceShipTwo rocket plane is taking passengers to space by the end of 2018. Virgin’s program was set back by a crash in late 2014 that killed a SpaceShipTwo co-pilot on a test flight. A SpaceShipTwo ride will cost about $250,000. Blue Origin has not started selling tickets, and officials have not disclosed a price tag for a New Shepard flight. Several university microgravity research experiments flew on New Shepard launches last year. “The vehicle we’re building is the human-rated vehicle,” Bezos said. “We’re going to go through the test program, and we’ll put humans on it when we’re happy. I don’t think it’s going to be 2017 at this point. It could be, but I still think we can do commercial paying passengers in 2018. Blue Origin’s New Shepard booster takes off on its fourth flight on June 19, 2016. Credit: Blue Origin “The good news about our architecture is it’s completely autonomous, so we can fly these vehicles with no humans, even though they’re human-capable, and do that as many times as we want until we’re confident and comfortable, and then we can put humans on-board,” Bezos said. “If we had to have pilots, for example, we couldn’t use that approach, but the fully autonomous nature of the vehicle makes it easy to do that.” Blue Origin engineers are upgrading the software and heat shield used on Version No. 2 of New Shepard, replacing spray-on insulation with a metallic thermal protection system near the ring attach point with the crew capsule and on the booster’s fins, according to Rob Meyerson, president of Blue Origin. The crew capsule will also feature windows — the largest to ever fly in space — that have been rated to launch and land 100 times. “When you get in here, I think you’ll have that same emotion many of us, certainly me, have lived with since we were little kids and we wanted to go to space,” Bezos said from inside the capsule mock-up. “Everybody says that when you go to space it changes you. All the astronauts come back with stories like that.” Blue Origin hosted reporters inside the scale model of the crew capsule after Bezos took questions Wednesday. “It’s going to be a pretty comfortable ride, but an exciting ride,” said Ariane Cornell, head of astronaut strategy and sales at Blue Origin. The recumbent seats, modeled on helicopter seats, can fit short and tall would-be space fliers, keeping with Blue Origin’s goal of accommodating up to 95 percent of potential passengers. Customers would spend about a day or day-and-a-half training at Bezos’s West Texas launch site before strapping into the New Shepard’s crew capsule at about T-minus 30 minutes. A view inside Blue Origin’s crew capsule. Credit: Blue Origin A tabletop-looking structure in the middle of the capsule covers the ship’s abort motor, which would save passengers from a failing rocket. There are no controls — the spaceship flies on autopilot — but each seat has a tablet-sized video screen showing external views and real-time altitude and speed data. The cabin is otherwise sparse, with padded walls and an open design. “A lot of design thought was put into the interior of the capsule,” said Cornell as she gave reporters a tour of the craft. “What we wanted to do is to really embrace and celebrate the engineering that’s gone into this.” Once the New Shepard’s BE-3 engine switches off, the capsule will separate and arc in weightlessness for about four minutes. During that time, the passengers will unstrap their seat belts and float around the cabin, using handrails to ease their movement. On the way up, fliers will experience 3gs of acceleration. That will briefly spike to up to 5.5gs on descent, Cornell said. The whole jaunt will take about 11 minutes. Bezos said he is optimistic Blue Origin will get plenty of sign-ups once sales begin, but there are unknowns in the market. “We can build as many of these vehicles as we need,” Bezos said. “The real question is what will the customer demand be. You can do research and surveys and ask people if they want to go, but it’s really hard to know. Really, you just have to do the experiment, so we’re very close to finding out what the customer demand will be, but I think nobody knows that for sure yet.” The New Shepard is just a stepping stone to bigger ambitions. Blue Origin’s New Glenn rocket, to be built at a cavernous factory under construction near NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida, will be able to deliver up to 100,000 pounds — around 45 metric tons — of payload to an orbit several hundred miles above Earth. Bezos said New Glenn’s development is projected to cost about $2.5 billion. The company has not revealed a price for one flight of the rocket. The towering booster, powered by seven BE-4 engines fed by a mix of methane and liquid oxygen, will blast off from Complex 36 at Cape Canaveral, a few miles from the manufacturing plant. The first full-scale hotfire test of a BE-4 engine is expected within weeks in West Texas, a milestone that is being closely watched by United Launch Alliance, the 50-50 joint venture between Boeing and Lockheed Martin. If the testing goes well, ULA will likely use two of the BE-4 engines on the first stage of its next-generation Vulcan rocket, which will replace the Delta 4 and Atlas 5 rockets in its present-day fleet. Using a landing scheme planned by Blue Origin for years — but pioneered in practice by SpaceX — the New Glenn’s first stage will touch down on an offshore floating barge for reuse. “This is all about reusability,” Bezos said of the New Shepard and New Glenn. “Reusability is the key to getting millions of people living and working in space. It has to real operational reusability. It can’t be just theoretical reusability.” SpaceX, led by billionaire Elon Musk, is ahead of Blue Origin in achieving that objective. A Falcon 9 rocket booster that first flew in April 2016 launched again with a commercial communications satellite March 30 after extensive inspections and refurbishment. SpaceX aims to cut down on the turnaround tasks for future reused rockets. “If you recover and spend a lot of time and money X-raying, revalidating everything and refurbishing everything, it’s not actually going to lower costs,” Bezos said. “You have to get much more like airliner operations. You have to be able to land, refuel, maybe do some minor inspections, and then off you go again, and that’s where we going to get to.” Falling prices will lead to a growing space industry, Bezos said. “Most of the things you want to do in space that are really interesting right now have a very high price of admission, and as a result, you can’t unleash the creativity of thousands and thousands of start-up companies and kids in dorm rooms everywhere,” Bezos said. “But if we can reduce the cost of launch by a factor of 10, and then by a factor of 100 — believe me, that’s going to take time and a lot of hard work — but if we can do that you will be living in a completely new world. “It will be a golden age of space exploration,” he said. Blue Origin is sure to play a part in the revolution, according to Bezos. “It’s going to be very difficult, I think, in advance to know what the cost curve is going to be — how low it’s going to come down,” Bezos said. “Here’s what I can tell you though: I am determined to lower the cost of access to space, and we at Blue Origin only need three things to make that happen: talented people, money and patience. And we have all three.” Email the author. Follow Stephen Clark on Twitter: @StephenClark1.

That Falcon main stage had been recovered from a successful return landing on an ocean platform shortly after its maiden flight last April, then was relaunched and salvaged again last Thursday, marking a spaceflight first. “I would be comfortable if we were to fly on a reused booster,” General John "Jay" Raymond told reporters at the U.S. Space Symposium in Colorado Springs. “They’ve proven they can do it. ... It’s going to get us to lower cost.” SpaceX has so far won three launch contracts to fly military and national security satellites - business previously awarded exclusively to United Launch Alliance, a partnership of Lockheed Martin and Boeing . All those flights will take place on new Falcon 9 rockets. SpaceX, owned and operated by technology entrepreneur Elon Musk, has a backlog of more than 70 missions worth more than US$10 billion. After last week's landmark launch, Musk said the company planned to fly about 20 more rockets this year, including the debut blastoff of its new heavy-lift vehicle. Up to six of those missions, including the Falcon Heavy, will use previously flown boosters, he said. Speaking at the symposium on Wednesday, SpaceX President Gwynne Shotwell said the cost of refurbishing and reflying the Falcon 9 first stage was "substantially less than half" the cost of manufacturing a new booster - the most expensive part of the rocket. SpaceX’s website lists the cost of a basic Falcon 9 launch at US$62 million. SpaceX expects to reduce costs even further. The company’s next goal is to launch and return a rocket and relaunch it within 24 hours. "That’s when we’ll really feel like we’ve got reusability right," Shotwell said. Raymond said the Air Force would need to certify that a used booster could safely deliver its satellites into orbit. "I'm pretty comfortable we'll get comfortable with doing it," Raymond said. "This is just beginning.” (Editing by Steve Gorman and Peter Cooney) - Reuters Email More YOU MAY ALSO LIKE From Our Website From the Web Happening Now new window view more My Facebook Friends Back To Top JUMP TO Select Section Asia Pacific Singapore World Business Sport Entertainment Technology Health Lifestyle Videos Weather Photos Special Reports Archives Services PSI Navigate to: News TV Connect Watch Live GET OUR APPS iPhone/iPad Android Get Our News Facebook Twitter Linkedin YouTube Mobile SMS eNews RSS News Asia Pacific World Sport Technology Lifestyle Photos Archives Singapore Business Entertainment Health Videos Special Reports TV Live News Schedule Shows Services Weather ADVERTISE WITH US Online Mobile TV Contact Sales Channel NewsAsia Channel News Asia About Us Coverage Hotel Partners Events & Seminars Presenters & Correspondents Contact Us Mediacorp Mediacorp News Group © 2017 About Mediacorp Pte Ltd Terms and Conditions Privacy Policy Back To Top

The Pentagon, which is the headquarters of the United States Department of Defense (DOD), is the world's largest office building by floor area, with about 6,500,000 sq ft (600,000 m2), of which 3,700,000 sq ft (340,000 m2) are used as offices. Approximately 23,000 military and civilian employees and about 3,000 non-defense support personnel work in the Pentagon. Staff/AFP/Getty Images.    The Pentagon Is Spending More On Contracts, But There’s A Problem Thomas Phippen Author 6:29 PM 04/06/2017      Pinterest  Reddit  LinkedIn  WhatsApp     Share         TOP 5578402 The Pentagon is starting to spend more on defense systems after a period of drawdown during the Obama administration, but funding for new weapons programs is still flat. “The tide has definitely turned in the direction of contract spending,” according to a new report from the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS). Overall defense obligations rose by 7 percent in 2016, a sign that defense spending is “actually growing again,” according to Andrew Hunter, a former Department of Defense acquisitions official, who now studies military spending at CSIS. Research and development spending, however, is in a seven-year decline that could stretch for several more because the military isn’t filling up the “major weapons systems development pipeline.” “There is no end in sight to the trough in the pipeline for weapon systems,” the report said, and “a dearth of new development programs for major weapons systems that replace those that have either graduated into production or been canceled.” Part of the reason for the decline in weapons development spending is the completion of large programs, particularly the F-35 program. In 2015, the Pentagon spent around $22.5 billion on research and development, less than the $25 billion in 2000, and far below the peak spending in that sector at $48 billion in 2011. For defense contractors, a continuing decline or slow uptick in research spending means they may not put as much effort building research for development infrastructure. “What gain is it to Lockheed [Martin] to have a big Skunk Works, or Phantom Works at Boeing, if there’s nothing to compete for? So I think you’ll see their focus and their workforce shift,” Hunter told Defense News. “Defense companies are like utilities, they, make a steady return. It’s never sexy, it’s never splashy, but you can count on it. And I think they become more like utilities in that world.” Research and development contracts “have borne a disproportionate share of cuts within the DoD contracting portfolio during the current budget drawdown,” the report said. “The dimensions of those cuts, however, have not followed the expected path. Despite fears that early stage, seed corn R&D would be hit particularly hard, the data show that it has been relatively preserved compared to the overall declines in R&D.” “I’m guessing this trough will end up being 10-12 years long, which is unprecedented,” Hunter said.

(AP Photo/Manuel Balce Ceneta, File) Single page Share This Article ARTICLE PHOTO GALLERY (3) Washington • Robert Lighthizer has long complained that the United States dithered in the face of abusive Chinese trade policies, allowing its trade gap with Beijing to explode and American factories to close. Now, the veteran trade lawyer may have a chance to do something about it. As President Donald Trump's choice to be U.S. trade representative, the 69-year-old Lighthizer would be empowered to renegotiate and enforce trade deals, many of which the new president has condemned as destroyers of American jobs. On Thursday, the Senate Finance Committee postponed a vote on Lighthizer's nomination because two members from Ohio — Republican Rob Portman and Democrat Sherrod Brown — were attending a memorial service at Arlington National Cemetery for the late Ohio Democratic Sen. John Glenn. VIDEOS TOP JOBS (His confirmation has been held up by a political dispute over whether he needs a congressional waiver because he has worked for foreign companies. The delay means Lighthizer isn't in his job as Trump prepares to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping in Mar-a-Lago, Florida.) A fixture in Washington trade policy circles for nearly four decades, Lighthizer has built a reputation as a shrewd negotiator. And like the president who chose him, Lighthizer represents a departure for a Republican Party that for decades favored the free flow of global trade as a boon to economic growth. "I agree with President Trump that we should have an 'America First' trade policy," Lighthizer said at his committee hearing last month. "And that we can do better in negotiating our trade agreements and be stronger at enforcing our trade laws." His nomination sends another signal that the Trump administration intends to upend decades of U.S. policy and act aggressively to block imports when it deems other countries to be acting unfairly. "He's a trade realist," Paul Rosenthal, a trade lawyer at the firm Kelley Drye & Warren. "He doesn't necessarily subscribe to free trade as a religion as some people do." Lighthizer's philosophy, Rosenthal suggests, essentially boils down to: "How can we afford to be unilateral free traders when the Chinese don't reciprocate?" Drawing from experience in trade law and his work in the Reagan administration in countering Japanese imports, Lighthizer will likely try to force China and other competitors to end what the Trump team sees as unfair trade. Supporters of free trade, such as analysts at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, argue that a Trump-Lighthizer combative approach could backfire. Blocking or taxing imports would raise prices of imports for American consumers and provoke retaliation. The result could potentially be a trade war that would hurt U.S. farmers and companies — from Boeing to Caterpillar — that depend on exports. Lighthizer won't be the administration's only trade policy heavyweight. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, a billionaire investor, is expected to involve himself in trying to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico and other trade issues. And Trump named Peter Navarro, a vociferous critic of Chinese trade policy, to lead a new White House National Trade Council. Could Lighthizer be overshadowed? "The words 'overshadow' and 'Bob Lighthizer' shouldn't appear in the same sentence," says Clyde Prestowitz, a Commerce official in the Reagan administration and a longtime critic of U.S. trade policy. Lighthizer has more congressional contacts and more experience with the fine points of trade law than Navarro or Ross. In 2008, he wrote a column in The New York Times criticizing Sen. John McCain, the Republican presidential candidate, for his unstinting support of free trade. Lighthizer noted that "conservative statesmen from Alexander Hamilton to Ronald Reagan sometimes supported protectionism." "They always understood that trade policy was merely a tool for building a strong and independent country with a prosperous middle class," he wrote. Lighthizer's confirmation vote had been delayed by a political rift: Some Democrats argued that he must obtain a waiver from Congress because he has worked in the past for foreign clients. They said they would support the waiver only if Republicans pass an unrelated bill to protect the endangered pension and health care benefits of retired coal miners. » Next page...

Specifically, the judge shot down arguments that Putnam received excessive management fees from their proprietary mutual funds, saying plaintiffs' comparison of Putnam fund fees to those of Vanguard Group's passively managed funds was "flawed."

The Company operates the largest fleet of Boeing aircraft in the world, the majority of which are equipped with satellite-based WiFi providing gate-to-gate connectivity.  That connectivity enables Customers to use their personal devices to view video on-demand movies and television shows, as well as nearly 20 channels of free, live TV compliments of our valued Partners. Southwest created Transfarency®, a philosophy which treats Customers honestly and fairly, and in which low fares actually stay low. Southwest is the only major U.S. airline to offer bags fly free®* to everyone (first and second checked pieces of luggage, size and weight limits apply, some airlines may allow free checked bags on select routes or for qualified circumstances), and there are no change fees, though fare differences might apply**. The airline proudly unveiled a bold new look:  Heart.  A new logo, aircraft livery, interior design featuring a new seat and Flight Attendant galley, Employee-designed uniforms, and an updated airport experience all showcase the dedication of Southwest Employees who connect Customers with what's important in their lives. From its first flights on June 18, 1971, Southwest Airlines launched an era of unprecedented affordability in air travel described by the U.S. Department of Transportation as "The Southwest Effect," a lowering of fares and increase in passenger traffic whenever the carrier enters new markets.  With 44 consecutive years of profitability, Southwest is one of the most honored airlines in the world, known for a triple bottom line approach that contributes to the carrier's performance and productivity, the importance of its People and the communities they serve, and an overall commitment to efficiency and the planet.

The report covers the market landscape and its growth prospects over the coming years. The report also includes a discussion of the key vendors operating in this market.   (EMAILWIRE.COM, April 06, 2017 ) Attack helicopters or gunships are designed to carry heavy armaments such as anti-tank guided missiles (ATGMs) like Hellfire, auto canons, unguided rockets, heavy machine guns, and air-to-air missiles. The air-to-air missiles carried by them are mostly deployed for self-defense purposes.

U.S. stocks closed off intraday highs Thursday as President Donald Trump hosted his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping for their first official meeting, as investors sought clues to how the leaders of the world’s economic powerhouses will tackle trade and geopolitical issues. The mood in the market, however, remained cautious as investors awaited nonfarm-payrolls data due on Friday. Read: What to watch in the jobs report: slowing growth, rising pay The S&P 500 index SPX, +0.19%  rose 4.54 points, or 0.2%, to close at 2,357.49. Energy shares, which followed rising oil prices higher, topped the gains but investors sold telecoms shares, with the sector down 1.6%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.07%  gained 14.80 points to finish at 20,662.95. On Wednesday the blue-chip index went from a 200-point gain to finish down 0.2%, the benchmark’s biggest blown lead since February 2016. The Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, +0.25%  climbed 14.47 points, or 0.3%, to end at 5,878.95. Thursday’s action follows the biggest one-day reversal for equities in more than a year in the previous session, which was triggered in part by the Federal Reserve’s admission that it will start unwinding its balance sheet sooner than expected. “We are seeing a short-term snap back from yesterday’s sharp selloff with the hardest-hit sectors recovering,” said Frank Cappelleri, chartered market technician at Instinet. The Dow and the Nasdaq briefly traded in negative territory during the session Thursday after Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said the U.S. government is considering an “appropriate response” to Syria’s chemical attacks. Tillerson also hinted at the possibility of removing Syrian President Bashar Assad from power, stating that his actions suggest “there would be no role for him to govern the Syrian people,” CNBC reported. But for most of the day, the market trended higher as investors looked for bargains following Wednesday’s selloff. “We are seeing rotational buying as funds move around. Every time the market dips, investors come back,” said Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Asset Management. Trump’s trade promises on the line with China(3:35) U.S. President Donald Trump promises tough trade negotiations this week with Chinese President Xi Jinping to stop American job losses. What’s at stake in Mar-a-Lago? Investors are closely watching the Trump-Xi summit amid some concerns that the two-day meeting could end in acrimonious fashion, spooking global financial markets. Read: Why investors are fretting over the Trump-Xi meeting And see: Trump’s meeting with China’s Xi could have a lasting impact on the dollar However, Julian Evans-Pritchard, China economist at Capital Economics, suggested that Trump is likely to tone down his criticism of China’s trade policies to focus more on the threat from North Korea. “Xi may come offering minor concessions in order to mollify Trump, such as pledges to invest in job-creating projects in the U.S. or deals to purchase key American exports such Boeing planes,” wrote Evans-Pritchard in a note to investors. “But token gestures aside, we don’t expect any major policy announcements to come out of the meeting.” The Trump-Xi summit is somewhat overshadowing the March nonfarm-payrolls data as a focus for investors. Economists expect the monthly jobs report, due Friday, will show that job creation could slow after the two previous sharp gains. Thursday’s data on jobless claims showed the number of Americans who applied for unemployment benefits last week sank by 25,000 to 234,000, marking the second-lowest level of the current economic expansion and reflecting a tight labor market in which firms say it’s hard to find good help. On Wednesday, data on private-sector hiring showed far more jobs created than anticipated. Stocks to watch: Shares of Sunoco LP SUN, +20.24%  soared 20% after Japan-based Seven & I Holdings Co. Ltd. 3382, +4.34% which owns the 7-Eleven chain, said it would acquire more than 1,000 U.S. convenience stores and gas stations from Sunoco for $3.3 billion. CarMax Inc. KMX, +2.36%  shares rose 2.4% after the nation’s biggest retailer of used cars beat earnings and sales estimates for the fourth quarter. Constellation Brands Inc. STZ, +6.43%  reported stronger fourth-quarter earnings on Thursday, which it attributed to gains in high-end whiskey sales. Shares jumped 6.4%. Shares of large retailers that had sold off lately rebounded Thursday. L Brands, Inc. LB, +11.02%  gained 11%, and Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. BBBY, +3.39% and Kohl’s Corp KSS, +5.55%  were sharply higher. Other markets: Asian stocks ADOW, -0.12%  finished in the red, with the Nikkei NIK, +0.36%  hitting its worst level in four months and closing down 1.4%, but European stocks SXXP, +0.18%  traded mostly higher. European Central Bank President Mario Draghi in a speech Thursday effectively ruled out a near-term interest-rate increase, which briefly sent the euro to a three-week low against the dollar. The dollar USDJPY, -0.19%  index edged up. Gold prices GCM7, +0.90%  rose while oil prices CLM7, +1.21% also climbed. —Barbara Kollmeyer contributed to this article.

REUTERS/Toby Melville/Lucas Jackson/File Photos REUTERS Comment Share Tweet Stumble Email Two of the world’s most powerful leaders, President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping, are set to meet for the first time in Mar-a-Lago on Thursday afternoon. The summit is expected to determine the areas where countries will work together under the new U.S. leadership. But no one should expect the revealing of some grand accord between the two nations -- and even reaching agreements on areas of mutual interest could be difficult. Play Video CBSN Trump meets with Chinese president amid North Korea tension CBS News' Major Garrett previews the summit between President Donald Trump and China's President Xi Jinping, just after North Korea launched a ba... “There is pressure on both sides not to give in,” says Dean Cheng, a Heritage Foundation Senior Research fellow for Chinese affairs. He points out the domestic pressure that both sides face: Trump had a recent failure on healthcare policy and Xi is facing an upcoming power transition with the 19th party congress. As a result, both leaders will be looking to uphold personal and national prestige. “Not every high level summit necessarily ends positively,” Cheng says. “It is possible that you could wind up with both sides ending up the way Trump did with Angela Merkel.” Trump has already declared in a tweet that the meeting will be “very difficult.” The new administration also has yet to present an overarching vision for the US-China relationship. This meeting will set the tone and, potentially, a path for how the countries plan to work with each other in the coming years. The primary focus of the talks will be on trade and North Korea. Establishing a “framework” for discussions on trade and investment is at the top of the agenda, according to the White House. This will be a particularly touchy topic as Trump aggressively went after China on the campaign trail in an effort to stand up for U.S. manufacturers. “We can’t continue to allow China to rape our country, and that’s what they’re doing,” Mr. Trump said in regard to trade with the country at a campaign rally in 2016. “We’re going to turn it around. And we have the cards, don’t forget it. We’re like the piggy bank that’s being robbed. We have the cards. We have a lot of power with China.” This kind of strident language has become more rare since Mr. Trump took over the White House, but he is still a tough talker when it comes to trade. Trump ended the possibility of the U.S. being a part of the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal with an executive order during his first week in office. Additionally, the White House is currently reviewing U.S. trade deficits. “We cannot continue to trade [with China] if we are going to have an unfair deal like we have right now. This is an unfair deal,” Mr. Trump explained to the Financial Times on Sunday, just four days before his visit with Xi. Play Video CBS This Morning Trump's Mar-a-Lago meetings raise ethics concerns President Trump's first face-to-face meeting today with China's leader, Xi Jinping, will take place at Mar-a-Lago, the president's family-owned r... North Korea, in the face of the regime’s ongoing missile and nuclear provocations, will also be a focal point. White House officials say that China still has “considerable” economic leverage over North Korea, and should drill down harder on the regime. The State Department echoed these wishes. “We will be looking for help from China to increase the pressure,” said Susan Thornton, the Acting Assistant Secretary for the Bureau of East Asian and Pacific Affairs at the State Department. Yet that does not mean that anything tangible will be announced after the visit. “I can’t say specifically what the discussion will be and where we’ll come out,” Thornton added in regard to North Korea discussions. The Trump administration is in the midst of an ongoing North Korea policy review, which means new U.S. policies regarding the isolated and unpredictable country are not yet fully cemented. This is also the first time that the two leaders are meeting which means that they must work to “build up the type of personal rapport and working relationship” which helps them deal with ongoing issues, opportunities and crises alike. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, issued an unusually terse statement earlier this week saying that the U.S. had no further comment on the recent North Korean missile launch. Tillerson will be at the meeting in Mar-a-Lago along with Secretary of Defense James Mattis, Secretary of the Department of Defense John Kelly and National Security Adviser Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster. It is expected that a good portion of the conversations in Mar-a-Lago will be contentious. When it comes to trade and North Korea, the Mr. Trump will be forcefully pressing China to take action that favors the U.S. Cheng explains that there are individual cases or individual deals that China could announce. They could commit to the purchase of Boeing 747s or enforce the current sanctions on North Korea. However, there is no expectation that they will do either of these things. As a result, questions are emerging about where the two countries will find ground for joint efforts. Climate change is an area that was once a shared priority for the nations. Just last year the Obama administration announced that the countries leaders had “forged a historic partnership between the United States and China to lead in combatting climate change. Last month, however, the Trump administration eliminated the State Department’s Global Climate Change Initiative and pledged to stop backing the UN Green Climate Fund. And Mr. Trump himself is a very vocal skeptic of climate change. “Climate change is no longer the source of glue for the relationship. If there are no areas to cooperate there is no cushion for areas of friction,” explains Bonnie Glaser, the director of the China Power Project at CSIS. There is no indication from experts who have talked to the Chinese delegation that they will bring up climate change and the U.S. is unlikely to broach the topic. “I don’t think that it’s going to be a major part of the discussion in Florida,” Thornton, from the State Department, explained to reporters. It may be up to Tillerson, who is now being cast as the public architect of U.S.-China relationship, to find areas for the countries to come together. He traveled to Asia last week and visited South Korea, Japan and China. Part of his mission was to lay the groundwork for this Xi-Trump summit. The State Department says that Tillerson, who plans to be in all of the meetings, will be a “major participant” in the talks. © 2017 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

Andrea: An Immigrant's Tale Of Success With A Long Island Connection By Paul Litwinovich • 15 hours ago TweetShareGoogle+Email Frank A.D. Andrea Credit Courtesy of Andrea Electronics Corporation When I decided to write about Frank A. D. Andrea, I thought that like Atwater Kent, David Sarnoff, Edwin Armstrong and others, that the research involved would be a cake walk, given his success in the radio business and his involvement in early television. But alas, Frank would at first prove to be more of a challenge. Online information about him was basic and sparse and I found that a lot of it contained at least some inaccuracies. Since he had established radio factories on Long Island, the local connection to the WSHU listening area makes the story even more interesting. My research eventually led me to the Andrea Electronics Corporation, where Frank’s grandson is currently president and CEO. Mr. Andrea (some sources incorrectly list him as D’Andrea) was born in Sacco, Italy, in 1888 to Francesco and Philomina Andrea. He came to the U.S. as an infant with his widowed mother in 1890. He attended public school until age 11, when he left to become a newsboy to help support his mother. He also worked for the Denis Trunk Repair Shop. He studied nights to become a tool and die maker at the Machinist’s Institute of NYC. He was also a featherweight boxer as a teenager.    In an early job as a machinist, Frank met Guglielmo Marconi and made some custom parts for one of his early radio sets. Marconi was impressed by Frank’s work and in return sent him several of his books about wireless technology. His further interest in radio grew out of an early job with the Frederick Pierce Co., a company that did experimental work for inventors. Later, in 1917, he worked as plant manager for Lee de Forest, manufacturing vacuum tubes (1, 2). Sometime around 1920, Frank went into business with his 16-year-old half-brother, John (3). The company name, FADA, was based on his initials. His first product was a crystal detector, a device used by both crystal radios and by some early tube sets. Within a year of station KDKA’s first broadcasts, the FADA company could not produce the crystal detectors fast enough to keep up with demand. He expanded to the point of renting space in three buildings on Jerome Avenue in the Bronx. One trait that Frank Andrea was exceptionally good at was foreseeing technology trends and future markets. He recognized that de Forest’s vacuum tubes would soon make crystal radio sets obsolete. By 1923, the company began producing its first complete tube radio sets. These sets were built using the Neutrodyne circuit, an improved version of the Tuned Radio Frequency circuit, licensed from the Hazeltine Corporation. The radios were well received by the public and sales were good. By 1926, the company is said to have produced close to 300,000 radios (4, 5). In 1925, Mr. Andrea organized FADA Radio LTD of Canada and FADA Radio LTD of England to manufacture and market the sets in those countries. The driving force, as Frank was known to say, “was to get rich.” A goal that he was well on his way to achieving, but at a cost. Apparently, working conditions in his factory were poor and employee relationships were less than stellar. In 1926, 500 of his 600 employees went on strike. A year later Lewis Clement, the company’s chief engineer left for a job at the Crosley Radio Company (4). Shortly thereafter, his chief operations officer Dick Klein also fell into disagreement with Frank Andrea and left (6). Despite setbacks, Frank was able to keep the company going and profitable. In 1928 he was one of the top five radio manufacturer in the U.S.    A FADA Bullet Catalin radio Credit Fada sales brochure After the market crash of 1929 and the depression that followed, and having achieved his goal of getting rich, Frank Andrea sold the company to a group described as “Boston investors” in 1932, in order to take an early retirement. FADA, without him, did not fare so well; it went bankrupt in 1934. It would flounder and eventually, a group of New York investors revived it. Reincorporated as the FADA Radio and Electric Co. and relocated to Long Island, N.Y., the company had a period of success in the late 1930s through the start of WWII. Looking back after he sold FADA in 1932, within two years, Frank Andrea decided that retirement was not for him. By 1934 he had incorporated the Andrea Radio Corporation. With FADA in bankruptcy, Frank was able to hire back a number of key employees (7). By 1935 his first new model, the 1A5 (8) was in production. I was able to find schematics and service information for the set, but no useable pictures from museums, private collections or other sources. It was an “All American Five” circuit with a pentagrid converter, and featured both broadcast and shortwave.   A 1939 Andrea Model 1F5 three-inch screen TV, which had its debut at the New York World’s Fair. Credit Unknown / Pinterest Andrea went on to manufacture a successful line of radios leading up to WWII, targeting both the consumer and amateur radio markets (2). By 1936 he again saw the writing on the wall with this new television technology phenomenon. RCA, in conjunction with NBC, demonstrated a private experimental broadcast to company executives in 1936. The Andrea Company began developing a consumer TV, closely watching the RCA effort to put the first experimental TV station on the air in New York City. Mr. Andrea was determined to be ready for this. Andrea advertisement for the 1F5 and KTE5 TV models. By 1939 he introduced the first commercially available TV, the model 1F5, at the New York World’s Fair, coinciding with RCA’s announcement that it had begun its experimental broadcasts. The TV had a three-inch black and white screen. In keeping with some of his previous radio products, it was also offered in kit form, making it more affordable to many. When WWII put a hold on further TV development and stopped the production of consumer electronics, the Andrea Radio Corp. developed a line of avionics intercom systems sold to Boeing, Lockheed Martin, and other government contractors for the war effort. Andrea Radio was awarded the Army-Navy “E” Award for WWII supplier excellence (1,9). The Andrea Radio Corporation received an Army-Navy "E" Award for production during World War II. Post-war, they resumed consumer production with an emphasis on TV technology. The company also received a substantial contract to produce radios under the Philips name for the European market as all of the Philips manufacturing facilities were destroyed during the war (1). A post-war production line at the Andrea factory. Here the workers are assembling the magnetic deflection units that mount on the neck of the picture tube. Credit D. Andrea collection Frank was joined by his son Frank, Jr. and daughter Camille in running the company. The company produced a line of high end televisions considered back then and by collectors today to be the “Cadillac” of early TV sets (4). The company heavily promoted the concept of the home entertainment console, a unit that combined a TV with a radio and often a phonograph. In 1954, after RCA released the first consumer color TV, the CT-100, Andrea began an effort to develop its own color set. It was released in 1957. Even at this time, only a handful of programs were broadcast in color. A magazine ad shows a 1965 color set offered without a cabinet for those handy enough to build it into a bookcase or entertainment center. The Andrea Radio Corp. did not abandon its development of military electronics after WWII, and was beginning to lean more in that direction, even as it continued to grow its consumer line of products.  In addition to continuing the development of aircraft intercommunication systems, the company would produce the guidance system for the first guided missile successfully launched by the U.S. Later they would develop the communications system for the Mercury space capsule program. The front cover of the May 1950 Radio TV News featured Frank, Sr. showing parts from the original KTE5 kit TV to his daughter, Camille, with his current TV/Radio console in the background. Credit Radio TV News Frank A.D. Andrea, Jr. was made president of the company in 1964, with Camille serving as director of PR and advertising. Frank, Sr. died on December 22, 1965. He was 77-years-old. The company today. The company continued to produce TVs, radios and other consumer electronics until the late 1970s. It continues to produce military electronics to this day. Except for a brief period between 2001 and 2005, the company has been continuously headed by a member of the Andrea family, with Douglas Andrea, the founder’s grandson, now president and CEO. Andrea Electronics, which is still headquartered on Long Island, played a role in developing computer sound systems for Dell, HP and other major computer manufacturers. In addition to defense work, the company also produces a line of consumer headphones and some high end microphone products.

Co-hosted with Long Beach State University and the City of Long Beach on Wednesday, April 12, 2017 at the Walter Pyramid on Long Beach State University's campus, the colloquium will feature panel discussions and presentations led by prominent industry leaders, educators, city officials and healthcare experts. "The extremely high caliber speakers presenting leading research and data, and discussing best practices for supporting seniors in today's world, is a testament to the quality of content that will be shared at this event," said Chris Wing, CEO of SCAN. "We look forward to bringing together a wide array of experts and thought leaders to collaborate on how best to provide a community-based, comprehensive network of care and services for seniors." Emceeing the colloquium is Tim Carpenter, founder and executive director of EngAGE and host and producer of radio show Experience Talks, which highlights the value of experience in today's society. EngAGE is a nonprofit providing life-enhancing arts, wellness, learning, community building and intergenerational programs and events to thousands of seniors and their families in Southern California. Additionally, Carpenter serves on the board of the National Center for Creative Aging and presented a TED Talk titled, "Thriving as We Age," at a Southern California affiliate event. His breadth of knowledge and unique perspective on aging will offer dynamism to the day's scheduled panel discussions and presentations. The full day of educational and engaging sessions will begin with welcome remarks from Monica Lounsbery, dean of the College of Health & Human Services at Long Beach State University and SCAN CEO Chris Wing. Both Lounsbery and Wing will describe for attendees their respective organizations' commitment to supporting community and senior health. They will also set the stage for closer collaboration on various community initiatives, which will be discussed in more depth in the subsequent panel sessions. A video message from Long Beach Mayor Robert Garcia will convey the City's vision to establish Long Beach as a laboratory for best practices supporting senior health and independence. Anne Tumlinson, CEO of Tumlinson Innovations, LLC and founder of Daughterhood, and Dr. Romilla Batra, chief medical officer of SCAN Group, will present "Seniors Today & Communities Reimagined." In this session, they will review recent research to identify key trends and dynamics that are shaping the future of senior health and independence. Dr. Batra will also discuss how SCAN has spearheaded several innovative programs to align with these trends and better support seniors and their caregivers. Kelly Colopy, director of City of Long Beach Department of Health and Human Services; Marie Knight, director of City of Long Beach Department of Parks, Recreation and Marine; and Tara Gruenewald, associate professor of gerontology and interim director of the Center for Successful Aging at Long Beach State University, will present a session titled, "Long Beach: A Laboratory for Senior Best Practices." In addition to her teaching and research career in the field of aging, Gruenewald is the president of the California Council on Gerontology and Geriatrics and is a fellow of the Gerontological Society of America. Leveraging her distinguished experience and expertise, she will address needed changes in the age structure of today's society, as well as innovations needed in social, physical, medical and technological environments in Long Beach and beyond. Colopy and Knight combined have more than three decades of experience in public service, and will present the City of Long Beach's initiatives to create a stronger support system for local seniors. Initiatives discussed will include the delivery of evidence-based classes for seniors, the establishment of a senior coordinator for the public library system, research into the needs of the older adult population and progress on the Older Adult Strategic Plan and the current and evolving programs and resources offered at the City's six senior centers. Delivering the keynote presentation is John Keisler, director of Economic and Property Development with the City of Long Beach. In this role, Keisler seeks to increase economic opportunities for entrepreneurs and investors in Long Beach. His keynote will discuss how innovation and economic development impacts seniors; the innovation incubators that already exist in Long Beach and new networks that may be established in the future; and how the City of Long Beach plans to better serve seniors through economic development. Participating in a panel discussion titled, "Technology: The Future of Aging," are Long Beach State University representatives Brian Budzinski, cofounder of the College of Business Administration Incubator, and Dr. Linna Li, assistant professor in the Department of Geography. Budzinski is a structural engineering manager at The Boeing Company, and founded the business incubator along with three colleagues while earning his MBA at Long Beach State University. The incubator serves to foster innovation, as well as inspire and support ideas that provide a positive environmental or social impact on the community. Budzinski will share with attendees details of several incubator initiatives that are staged to help seniors live healthier and more independent lives. Dr. Li's research includes geographic information science theories and applications in public health and urban development, and she will present implications from her work that can be leveraged to eliminate social isolation and its debilitating impact on seniors. To close out the day, Carpenter and Knight will lead an interactive session to encourage all speakers as well as attendees to share insights and ideas for supporting seniors in today's society, and in the future. Event hosts SCAN, Long Beach State University and City of Long Beach hope to take away concrete suggestions for strengthening the network of programs and resources available to seniors to help all lead more enriching and empowered lives. "Aging Reimagined will be an expansive and valuable event focused exclusively on the needs of today's seniors and their caregivers," said Wing. "Together with our partners at the City of Long Beach and Long Beach State University, we look forward to bringing this constructive information to the community and identifying opportunities to collaborate to improve the lives of our oldest residents."

Scott Applewhite/Associated Press) By Stephen Ohlemacher | AP By Stephen Ohlemacher | AP April 6 at 3:31 AM WASHINGTON — Faced with mounting opposition within the Republican Party, a powerful House committee chairman says he is making significant changes to a proposed tax on imports. Rep. Kevin Brady says he is working on changes to both the design of the tax and how it would be phased in. The Texas Republican did not offer more specifics, but said he meets regularly with President Donald Trump’s economic team. The Trump administration has sent mixed signals on the proposed tax. Brady, who chairs the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee, said the changes are based on input from businesses, individuals and, importantly, Senate Republicans. Not a single Republican senator has publicly supported the tax. A growing number have opposed it. “I think that the key is for us to work to resolve and narrow the differences on these provisions, always with the goal of the lowest rate in modern history for job creators,” Brady said. The changes are being worked on as Brady reaches out to House Democrats to gauge whether they will work with Republicans on a tax overhaul. Brady met with Democratic members of the committee Wednesday. Afterward, several Democrats said the meeting was cordial but preliminary. “We’re not negotiating with them at this point. We’re just listening,” said Rep. Joseph Crowley, D-N.Y. A growing number of House Republicans say that a tax overhaul should be bipartisan, especially after Republicans failed to pass a health care bill without trying to get support from Democrats. They worry that Republicans in the House will face the same divisions on a tax bill. The new “border adjustment tax” would be applied to profits from goods and services consumed in the U.S., whether they are domestically produced or imported. Exports would be exempt. The border tax is a key part of Republicans’ plan to lower the top corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 20 percent. It would raise more than $1 trillion over a decade to help pay for lower overall tax rates. House GOP leaders say the tax would help make American companies more competitive with their foreign counterparts, while encouraging companies to stay in the U.S. or even move here. Most tax experts agree that America’s current tax system rewards companies for moving headquarters and jobs overseas. The border tax is being lobbied hard on both sides. Industries that rely on imports, including retailers, automakers and oil refineries, say the tax would be passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices. They also warn that the new tax could violate trade rules under the World Trade Organization. A retail group led by Walmart, Target, Toyota, Best Buy and many others has launched a campaign against the tax. On the other side, Boeing, Caterpillar, General Electric and others say the tax would benefit American manufacturers, a key campaign promise by Trump. In theory, economists say that the new tax would cause the dollar to increase in value compared to other currencies. This would make imports cheaper and exports more expensive, reducing or even eliminating the effect of the tax on consumer prices. But there is no consensus among economists on how it would work in the real world. Because the tax is such a significant departure from the current system, many lawmakers from both parties are wary of it. “When it comes to border adjustment, I would need to see a transition rule that gives me a comfortable level that we’re not picking winners and losers, it can pass WTO, and at the same time we’re not pushing costs on to consumers,” said Rep. James Renacci, R-Ohio, a member of the Ways and Means Committee. Renacci has been working on his own tax plan and it doesn’t include the border tax. “I’m not a big believer that the federal government should be picking winners and losers, whether it’s in the auto industry or whether it’s in tax reform,” he said. ___ Follow Stephen Ohlemacher on Twitter at: http://twitter.com/stephenatap Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.

Footage shows Zheng Jiajia carrying his 'wife' Yingying everywhere they go together, as the bot is unable to walk or even move on its own. The 31-year-old programmed the doll so that it is able to communicate with him using basic words, but he is hoping to update it so that it can walk and help with chores around the house. His friends claimed that he built the robot because he was unable to find a human girlfriend.

The loss recorded by the group was incurred as a result of it reducing the value of its 20 per cent stake in its troubled banking arm to zero from £185m. You have to smile at the way the business chose to explain that. “A prudent valuation of minority shareholding in the Co-operative Bank," opined its press release.  Read more Co-op Bank's unique proposition must be preserved Co-Op Bank is putting itself up for sale Co-op chief executive to step down Prudence doesn’t have much to do with it. Given that the group will be lucky to get a nominal £1 when, if, the beleaguered bank finds a buyer, it didn’t have much choice.  The pity is that the banking arm’s troubles, one of the legacies of the gross mismanagement that left the entire institution teetering on the brink, obscured what Mr Leighton was talking about.  The group’s food arm, focussed on smaller convenience style stores, has been growing sales faster than all its competitors, with the exception of Aldi and Lidl (they were up 3.5 per cent at outlets open for at least a year in 2016) and is reliably profitable. The funeral business is similarly making money. The insurance operation is losing a lot less than it was.  The numbers for the group as a whole make for a complicated read. There are a lot of one-offs, and the average Co-op member could be forgiven for wondering what’s going on.  Which number do you look at? Pre-tax profits? Adjusted operating profits? Operating profits? Underlying profits?  The “underlying profit before tax” of £59m against £81m is probably the most accurate representation of where the business is. It fell chiefly as a result of increased investment (good thing). Based on that, “pretty good all things considered” might be a better description for the numbers than Mr Leighton's “exceptional”.    However, if you throw into the mix that all three core business units grew market share, and remember where the Co-op was barely a couple of years ago? Mr Leighton’s description could be considered an understatement.  The turnaround of this institution is a remarkable story. It’s the sort of thing MBA students might care to look at were they able to pull themselves away from gazing into their well groomed navels.  As for the future? It's tough out there, but it is possible to look at the Co-operative with a degree of optimism. Mr Leighton, whose father worked at the Co-op, is entitled to a bit of hyperbole.  Business picture of the day 33 show all Business picture of the day 1/33 Doritos, Coco Pops, Peperami among latest products to be hit by shrinkflation - Thursday April 6 Bags of Doritos, packets Peperami and boxes Coco Pops have become the latest treats to shrink in size as retailers passed on surging costs from the Brexit-hit pound and rising commodity prices. 2/33 Cuban family making their own wine brand using condoms - Wednesday April 5 family wine business in Cuba is thriving thanks in part to an unconventional item being added into the fermentation process – condoms. As a result of the US trade embargo and other inefficiencies of Cuba's economy, thousands of basic household items are inaccessible to Cubans meaning that sometimes a little creativity is required to get the job done. At El Canal, a winery in Havana, Orestes Estevez and his family fill glass jugs with grapes, ginger and hibiscus, before securing a condom over each glass jug Allowing Heathrow to expand will create “a serious obstacle” to meeting the UK’s commitments on climate change and reducing air pollution, a leading scientist has warned. AP 3/33 'Pink Star' diamond sells for world record £57m in Hong Kong auction - Tuesday April 4 A rare pink diamond dubbed the “Pink Star” has become the world's most expensive gemstone to sell at auction, coming under the hammer in Hong Kong on Tuesday for $71.2m (£57.3m). The oval-cut 59.6 carat jewel, discovered in a mine in Africa by De Beers in 1999, is the largest fancy vivid pink diamond, categorised as “flawless” or “internally flawless”, that the Gemological Institute of America (GIA) has ever graded. It sold after a five-minute bidding war, that started at $56m, to Hong Kong jewellery retailer Chow Tai Fook at Sotheby's. AP 4/33 Stopping climate change could boost the world economy by £15 trillion - Tuesday March 21 Efforts to slow climate change won’t just keep the planet habitable. They will also boost the world economy by $19 trillion (£15.2 trillion). Investments in renewable power and energy efficiency will add about 0.8 per cent to global gross domestic product by 2050, the International Renewable Energy Agency, or Irena, said Monday in a report produced for the German government. Governments are committing resources to green energy in a bid to keep warming within 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit), of pre-industrial conditions, in accordance with the landmark Paris Agreement on global warming. Getty 5/33 'UK Disneyland' set to open in five years in Kent - Friday March 10 It’s the news British film-lovers and thrill-seekers have been waiting to hear forever - no longer do we have to schlep across the seas to get our fix of stardust and adrenaline, for the UK is finally getting its own ‘Disneyland’. The theme park will be the first of its kind in the UK, and is being created by film company Paramount at a cost of £3.5 billion. Paramount 6/33 John Lewis cuts staff bonuses to lowest in 63 years despite soaring profits - Thursday March 9 John Lewis has cut its employee bonus to the lowest level in more than 60 years despite announcing surging profits. The partnership, which is owned by its employees, reduced the bonus to 6 per cent of salaries making it the lowest since 1954. It is the fourth year in a row that the payment has been cut. Pre-tax profits rose 21.2 per cent to £370.4m as overall sales rose 3.2 per cent but the group said it cut staff bonuses because of an “increasingly uncertain” market. Reuters 7/33 Philip Hammond downgrades UK economic growth for Brexit years - Wednesday March 8 The Chancellor was forced to slash his official economic growth forecasts while the Brexit talks take place, as he delivered his first Budget. Philip Hammond told MPs that Britain’s economy would grow faster than previously expected in the next financial year – by 2 per cent, up from 1.4 per cent. PA 8/33 UK businesses are already facing recruitment crisis as Polish workers head home - Friday February 15 After a Brexit vote in which a primary concern was too much immigration, some might be applauding the trend, but for important UK industries it is already creating a serious problem, and one that provides a preview of what may be to come for the wider economy. Reuters 9/33 Global sales of UK food and drink hit the £20bn mark for the first time - Tuesday February 21 Global sales of UK food and drink have hit the £20bn mark for the first time in history, as the Government prepares to ramp up its focus on international trade following the UK’s decision to leave the EU. Getty 10/33 Plastics industry 'pressured UK Government to cut recycling targets' - Friday February 17 Recycling targets in the UK were cut last year after successful lobbying from the plastics industry, a freedom of information request by Greenpeace has revealed. The Government came under fire last year after it announced that targets for plastic recycling would be reduced from 57 per cent to a mere 49 per cent for 2016 and then increased by 2 per cent each year to 2020, to a maximum of 57 per cent by 2020. AFP/Getty 11/33 Inflation hits 1.8% as post-Brexit pound weakness feeds through to high street - Tuesday February 14 UK consumer price inflation jumped to 1.8 per cent in the year to January, from a rise of 1.6 per cent in the year to December, as the slump in the pound since the Brexit referendum continued to trickle through to the high street. According to data from the Office for National Statistics published on Tuesday, January’s rise was the biggest since June 2014. But the jump narrowly missed analyst expectations for a 1.9 per cent increase, just below the Bank of England’s official 2 per cent target. Getty Images 12/33 Lettuce crisis hits those who love it most: hungry British sea turtles - Friday February 10 The UK’s vegetable crisis has not only gripped the country’s supermarkets and healthy eaters, but also a bale of 12 hungry green sea turtles in aquariums across the country. Eight aquariums run by the company Sea Life are calling on visitors to spare lettuce or broccoli for their shelled inhabitants who, as a result of a shortage of some vegetables in the UK, are missing out on their favourite meals. GREG WOOD/AFP/Getty Images 13/33 Tim Cook met Theresa May and said the UK would be 'just fine' post Brexit - Thursday February 9 The chief executive of Apple has told Prime Minister Theresa May that he is “very optimistic” about the UK’s future outside of the European Union. Tim Cook met Ms May at Downing Street on Thursday morning and reiterated the tech giant's plans to build a new UK headquarters at the Battersea Power Station as proof of the company's support of the UK. Getty 14/33 Brexit: Bank of England upgrades growth forecasts but still expects UK economy to be hit - Thursday Ferbruary 2 The Bank of England has dramatically upgraded its growth forecast for this year but stressed that households will still experience a major squeeze on incomes due to rising inflation. In its latest Inflation Report, the Bank upgraded its 2017 GDP growth forecast to 2 per cent, up from 1.4 per cent in November. The revision is certain to be seized upon by Brexiteers as evidence that the economy will not suffer from leaving the European Union and that previous economic warnings from the Bank have now been exposed as scaremongering. Yet the Bank’s forecasts continue to project a growth slowdown in 2018 and 2019, with GDP expected to expand by 1.6 per cent and 1.7 per cent in those years.

The investigation comes after online fashion retailer Asos was accused last year of exploitative working practises with staff reportedly unable to take regular water and toilet breaks for fears of missing targets. The company denied those allegations.

Tesco 18/33 Tobacco giant Imperial Brands scraps chief executive pay rise - Thursday January 26 The chief executive of Imperial Brands, the maker of Gauloises and Winston cigarettes, is unlikely to get a pay rise this year in what seems to be another battle over boardroom greed.

ADVERTISING inRead invented by Teads READ MORE Link between high executive pay and performance ‘negligible’ A new pay policy that would have had the effect of taking Ms Cooper’s remuneration to £8.5m in 2017 was expected to be put to a shareholders’ vote on 1 February.

In her speech in London on Tuesday, Ms May confirmed that Britain will leave the EU’s single market to regain control of immigration policy and said that she wants to renegotiate the UK’s customs agreement and seek a transition period to phase in changes all while remaining a “best friend” to the bloc.

Getty 32/33 Brexit: Banks in 'advanced talks' over mass move to Paris, says French regulator - Thursday December 8 Leading international UK-based banks are in advanced stages of planning to shift operations to Paris as London braces for the impact of Brexit, France's chief financial regulator has said. Paris is among a number of European cities seeking to woo firms considering a move away from London to maintain their access to EU markets, and faces competition from Dublin, Frankfurt and Luxembourg, among others. Reuters 33/33 Pfizer fined record £84.2m for overcharging NHS 2600% -Wednesday December 7 Drug firms Pfizer and Flynn Pharma have been fined nearly £90m by the UK’s competition watchdog for “unfair” pricing to the NHS after hiking up the cost of an anti-epilepsy drug by up to 2,600 per cent. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said these “extraordinary price rises” have costs taxpayers “tens of millions of pounds”. Getty Steve Murrells, who has taken over as group chief executive from Richard Pennycook, even held out the prospect of exploring new markets on a small scale when I talked to Co-op bosses this morning.   That might make some long standing members shudder a bit.  But the institution now boasts a more traditional plc-style board, combined with an elected member council to keep it honest. So as long as Co-op bosses pay due regard to the necessity of living up the institution’s ideals in practice as well as in principle, there shouldn't be too much cause for concern over any threat to the turnaround Mr Leighton has overseen.

The new design is more modest than the "Caspian Sea Monster" that so alarmed Western intelligence during the Cold War, and can only be seen taxiing. Ground effect vehicles were pioneered by Russian engineers, and take advantage of the increased lift generated by flying close to a fixed flat surface; ekranoplans were designed to operate optimally 3-6m above sea level. This ruled out use over many terrains, but with vast areas of the Black Sea and Caspian Sea to cover, the Soviet Union had a good reason to invest. It consequently developed enormous ground effect vehicles. The late Lester Haines told the ekranoplan story here. The giant vehicles puzzled and alarmed Western intelligence experts, who spotted the distinctive designs from reconnaissance photos and concluded that the craft, although moving at the speed of a conventional aircraft, couldn't actually "fly". Had the Soviets developed some new breakthrough in propulsion? Actually, the craft could "fly", just not very high. A LUN-class ekranoplan developed in the 1970s bristled with weapons, making it a formidable vehicle for a surprise coastal attack. Only two were ever operational. A smaller design, the A-90 ("Orlyonok"), developed by the Central Hydrofoil Design Bureau, was also designed for attack and adapted to be amphibious. Youtube Video Since the end of the Cold War, smaller ground effect craft have been developed privately. Boeing proposed an ambitious design in 2002 with a 500-ft wingspan, the Pelican ULTRA (Ultra Large Transport Aircraft), but the project never developed beyond concept. Welcome to the world of tomorrow. Field testing of ground effect vehicle in Russia. pic.twitter.com/bGCWdnJ3uE — Russian Embassy, UK (@RussianEmbassy) March 31, 2017 The new vehicle touted last week is a medium-sized twin turbine design operating on a frozen surface. Russian news agency TASS cited presidential advisor Alexander Bedritsky explaining the value of ground effect vehicles in the Arctic: Ground effect vehicles, if these are produced, suit the North perfectly. They can fly over the tundra, over the sea surface and over ice. A ground effect vehicle may fly for a thousand kilometres over tundra – there are no trees and no structures. Note the "if". It's a more conventional design than the A-050 that China was reportedly buying from Russia two years ago. That model is by the Alekseyev Central Hydrofoil Design Bureau based in Nizhny Novgorod, which kept the flame burning after the end of the Cold War. However, the Russian flight institute is said to be studying the feasibility of much larger ekranoplan designs for carrying freight in standard containers, or ULDs. The amphibious A-90 Ekranoplan from the Cold War era Ekranoplans have also fascinated the extraordinary American engineer Burt Rutan, who appears to have abandoned his work on a GEV for a more modest lake hopper, the Skigull. ® Tips and corrections 26 Comments More from The Register US navy to battle Iranian mini-ekranoplan swarms with rayguns Laser energy cannon vs 'stealth' WIG-ships 82 Comments 'BIGGEST BIRD EVER': 21-foot ripsaw-beaked flying HORROR Pic Fossil avian cruised above sea like toothy ekranoplan 47 Comments How AGILE DIPLOMACY will spike PUTIN'S GUNS ¡Bong!

Company Summary NSE BSE Brady Loading data... ADD TO PORTFOLIO ADD TO WATCHLIST SHARE YOUR OULOOK ChartsValuation & Peer ComparisonCommunity Buzz PEER COMPANIES Tax Alert: Fake rent receipts won't help you anymore WASHINGTON: Faced with mounting opposition within the Republican Party, a powerful House committee chairman says he is making significant changes to a proposed tax on imports. Rep. Kevin Brady says he is working on changes to both the design of the tax and how it would be phased in. The Texas Republican did not offer more specifics, but said he meets regularly with President Donald Trump's economic team. The Trump administration has sent mixed signals on the proposed tax. Brady, who chairs the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee, said the changes are based on input from businesses, individuals and, importantly, Senate Republicans. Not a single Republican senator has publicly supported the tax. A growing number have opposed it. "I think that the key is for us to work to resolve and narrow the differences on these provisions, always with the goal of the lowest rate in modern history for job creators," Brady said. The changes are being worked on as Brady reaches out to House Democrats to gauge whether they will work with Republicans on a tax overhaul. Brady met with Democratic members of the committee Wednesday. Afterward, several Democrats said the meeting was cordial but preliminary. "We're not negotiating with them at this point. We're just listening," said Rep. Joseph Crowley, D-N.Y. A growing number of House Republicans say that a tax overhaul should be bipartisan, especially after Republicans failed to pass a health care bill without trying to get support from Democrats. They worry that Republicans in the House will face the same divisions on a tax bill. The new "border adjustment tax" would be applied to profits from goods and services consumed in the US, whether they are domestically produced or imported. Exports would be exempt. The border tax is a key part of Republicans' plan to lower the top corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 20 percent. It would raise more than $1 trillion over a decade to help pay for lower overall tax rates. House GOP leaders say the tax would help make American companies more competitive with their foreign counterparts, while encouraging companies to stay in the US or even move here. Most tax experts agree that America's current tax system rewards companies for moving headquarters and jobs overseas. The border tax is being lobbied hard on both sides. Industries that rely on imports, including retailers, automakers and oil refineries, say the tax would be passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices. They also warn that the new tax could violate trade rules under the World Trade Organization. A retail group led by Walmart, Target, Toyota, Best Buy and many others has launched a campaign against the tax. On the other side, Boeing, Caterpillar, General Electric and others say the tax would benefit American manufacturers, a key campaign promise by Trump. In theory, economists say that the new tax would cause the dollar to increase in value compared to other currencies. This would make imports cheaper and exports more expensive, reducing or even eliminating the effect of the tax on consumer prices. But there is no consensus among economists on how it would work in the real world. Because the tax is such a significant departure from the current system, many lawmakers from both parties are wary of it. "When it comes to border adjustment, I would need to see a transition rule that gives me a comfortable level that we're not picking winners and losers, it can pass WTO, and at the same time we're not pushing costs on to consumers," said Rep. James Renacci, R-Ohio, a member of the Ways and Means Committee. Renacci has been working on his own tax plan and it doesn't include the border tax. "I'm not a big believer that the federal government should be picking winners and losers, whether it's in the auto industry or whether it's in tax reform," he said.

The results mean that the mutual has fallen into the red for the first time since 2013. In a statement, it said that the markets in which it operates remained “fiercely competitive” and that it was still contesting with “challenging consumer and economic backdrop”. Read more Co-Op Bank is putting itself up for sale It called its valuation of the Co-operative Bank “prudent” considering that it was in the middle of a sales process, the outcome of which was still uncertain. Back in February, the Co-operative Bank was put up for sale after it said that that its capacity to organically meet longer-term UK bank regulatory capital requirements had become “constrained by the impact of interest rates that are lower than previously forecast ... and by higher than anticipated transformation and conduct remediation costs”. In 2013, the bank narrowly avoided collapse after problematic real estate loans left a £1.5bn hole in its capital base.

The oval-cut 59.6 carat jewel, discovered in a mine in Africa by De Beers in 1999, is the largest fancy vivid pink diamond, categorised as “flawless” or “internally flawless”, that the Gemological Institute of America (GIA) has ever graded. It sold after a five-minute bidding war, that started at $56m, to Hong Kong jewellery retailer Chow Tai Fook at Sotheby's.

The partnership, which is owned by its employees, reduced the bonus to 6 per cent of salaries making it the lowest since 1954. It is the fourth year in a row that the payment has been cut. Pre-tax profits rose 21.2 per cent to £370.4m as overall sales rose 3.2 per cent but the group said it cut staff bonuses because of an “increasingly uncertain” market.

Getty 10/33 Plastics industry 'pressured UK Government to cut recycling targets' - Friday February 17 Recycling targets in the UK were cut last year after successful lobbying from the plastics industry, a freedom of information request by Greenpeace has revealed. The Government came under fire last year after it announced that targets for plastic recycling would be reduced from 57 per cent to a mere 49 per cent for 2016 and then increased by 2 per cent each year to 2020, to a maximum of 57 per cent by 2020. AFP/Getty 11/33 Inflation hits 1.8% as post-Brexit pound weakness feeds through to high street - Tuesday February 14 UK consumer price inflation jumped to 1.8 per cent in the year to January, from a rise of 1.6 per cent in the year to December, as the slump in the pound since the Brexit referendum continued to trickle through to the high street. According to data from the Office for National Statistics published on Tuesday, January’s rise was the biggest since June 2014. But the jump narrowly missed analyst expectations for a 1.9 per cent increase, just below the Bank of England’s official 2 per cent target.

Tim Cook met Ms May at Downing Street on Thursday morning and reiterated the tech giant's plans to build a new UK headquarters at the Battersea Power Station as proof of the company's support of the UK. Getty 14/33 Brexit: Bank of England upgrades growth forecasts but still expects UK economy to be hit - Thursday Ferbruary 2 The Bank of England has dramatically upgraded its growth forecast for this year but stressed that households will still experience a major squeeze on incomes due to rising inflation. In its latest Inflation Report, the Bank upgraded its 2017 GDP growth forecast to 2 per cent, up from 1.4 per cent in November. The revision is certain to be seized upon by Brexiteers as evidence that the economy will not suffer from leaving the European Union and that previous economic warnings from the Bank have now been exposed as scaremongering. Yet the Bank’s forecasts continue to project a growth slowdown in 2018 and 2019, with GDP expected to expand by 1.6 per cent and 1.7 per cent in those years.

Scott Applewhite) By: Stephen OhlemacHer The Associated Press Published on WASHINGTON — Faced with mounting opposition within the Republican Party, a powerful House committee chairman says he is making significant changes to a proposed tax on imports. Rep. Kevin Brady says he is working on changes to both the design of the tax and how it would be phased in. The Texas Republican did not offer more specifics, but said he meets regularly with President Donald Trump's economic team. The Trump administration has sent mixed signals on the proposed tax. Brady, who chairs the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee, said the changes are based on input from businesses, individuals and, importantly, Senate Republicans. Not a single Republican senator has publicly supported the tax. A growing number have opposed it. "I think that the key is for us to work to resolve and narrow the differences on these provisions, always with the goal of the lowest rate in modern history for job creators," Brady said. The changes are being worked on as Brady reaches out to House Democrats to gauge whether they will work with Republicans on a tax overhaul. Brady met with Democratic members of the committee Wednesday. Afterward, several Democrats said the meeting was cordial but preliminary. "We're not negotiating with them at this point. We're just listening," said Rep. Joseph Crowley, D-N.Y. A growing number of House Republicans say that a tax overhaul should be bipartisan, especially after Republicans failed to pass a health care bill without trying to get support from Democrats. They worry that Republicans in the House will face the same divisions on a tax bill. The new "border adjustment tax" would be applied to profits from goods and services consumed in the U.S., whether they are domestically produced or imported. Exports would be exempt. The border tax is a key part of Republicans' plan to lower the top corporate income tax rate from 35 per cent to 20 per cent . It would raise more than $1 trillion over a decade to help pay for lower overall tax rates. House GOP leaders say the tax would help make American companies more competitive with their foreign counterparts, while encouraging companies to stay in the U.S. or even move here. Most tax experts agree that America's current tax system rewards companies for moving headquarters and jobs overseas. The border tax is being lobbied hard on both sides. Industries that rely on imports, including retailers, automakers and oil refineries, say the tax would be passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices. They also warn that the new tax could violate trade rules under the World Trade Organization. A retail group led by Walmart, Target, Toyota, Best Buy and many others has launched a campaign against the tax. On the other side, Boeing, Caterpillar, General Electric and others say the tax would benefit American manufacturers, a key campaign promise by Trump. In theory, economists say that the new tax would cause the dollar to increase in value compared to other currencies. This would make imports cheaper and exports more expensive, reducing or even eliminating the effect of the tax on consumer prices. But there is no consensus among economists on how it would work in the real world. Because the tax is such a significant departure from the current system, many lawmakers from both parties are wary of it. "When it comes to border adjustment, I would need to see a transition rule that gives me a comfortable level that we're not picking winners and losers, it can pass WTO, and at the same time we're not pushing costs on to consumers," said Rep. James Renacci, R-Ohio, a member of the Ways and Means Committee. Renacci has been working on his own tax plan and it doesn't include the border tax. "I'm not a big believer that the federal government should be picking winners and losers, whether it's in the auto industry or whether it's in tax reform," he said. ___ Follow Stephen Ohlemacher on Twitter at: http://twitter.com/stephenatap Editors' Picks Video: A man tried Kendall Jenner's Pepsi peace trick, it did not go well Good dogs: Study says pooches can help reduce allergies, obesity in kids More than a feline: But why are cats just so...weird?

House GOP is changing it By STEPHEN OHLEMACHER and The Associated Press April 6, 2017 3:27 am 3 min read Share WASHINGTON (AP) — Faced with mounting opposition within the Republican Party, a powerful House committee chairman says he is making significant changes to a proposed tax on imports. Rep. Kevin Brady says he is working on changes to both the design of the tax and how it would be phased in. The Texas Republican did not offer more specifics, but said he meets regularly with President Donald Trump’s economic team. The Trump administration has sent mixed signals on the proposed tax. Brady, who chairs the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee, said the changes are based on input from businesses, individuals and, importantly, Senate Republicans. Online Chat: DJ Kachman, the Veterans Affairs Department’s director of mobile and security technology transformation lead, on April 10, at 1 p.m. Advertisement Not a single Republican senator has publicly supported the tax. A growing number have opposed it. “I think that the key is for us to work to resolve and narrow the differences on these provisions, always with the goal of the lowest rate in modern history for job creators,” Brady said. The changes are being worked on as Brady reaches out to House Democrats to gauge whether they will work with Republicans on a tax overhaul. Brady met with Democratic members of the committee Wednesday. Afterward, several Democrats said the meeting was cordial but preliminary. “We’re not negotiating with them at this point. We’re just listening,” said Rep. Joseph Crowley, D-N.Y. A growing number of House Republicans say that a tax overhaul should be bipartisan, especially after Republicans failed to pass a health care bill without trying to get support from Democrats. They worry that Republicans in the House will face the same divisions on a tax bill. Read the latest on Donald Trump's first 100 days in office. The new “border adjustment tax” would be applied to profits from goods and services consumed in the U.S., whether they are domestically produced or imported. Exports would be exempt. The border tax is a key part of Republicans’ plan to lower the top corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 20 percent. It would raise more than $1 trillion over a decade to help pay for lower overall tax rates. House GOP leaders say the tax would help make American companies more competitive with their foreign counterparts, while encouraging companies to stay in the U.S. or even move here. Most tax experts agree that America’s current tax system rewards companies for moving headquarters and jobs overseas. The border tax is being lobbied hard on both sides. Industries that rely on imports, including retailers, automakers and oil refineries, say the tax would be passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices. They also warn that the new tax could violate trade rules under the World Trade Organization. A retail group led by Walmart, Target, Toyota, Best Buy and many others has launched a campaign against the tax. On the other side, Boeing, Caterpillar, General Electric and others say the tax would benefit American manufacturers, a key campaign promise by Trump. In theory, economists say that the new tax would cause the dollar to increase in value compared to other currencies. This would make imports cheaper and exports more expensive, reducing or even eliminating the effect of the tax on consumer prices. But there is no consensus among economists on how it would work in the real world. Because the tax is such a significant departure from the current system, many lawmakers from both parties are wary of it. “When it comes to border adjustment, I would need to see a transition rule that gives me a comfortable level that we’re not picking winners and losers, it can pass WTO, and at the same time we’re not pushing costs on to consumers,” said Rep. James Renacci, R-Ohio, a member of the Ways and Means Committee. Renacci has been working on his own tax plan and it doesn’t include the border tax. “I’m not a big believer that the federal government should be picking winners and losers, whether it’s in the auto industry or whether it’s in tax reform,” he said. ___ Follow Stephen Ohlemacher on Twitter at: http://twitter.com/stephenatap Topics: All News Business News Government News Leave A Comment Home » The Associated Press » Government News » Don't like the proposed… Partners FEDERAL INSIGHTS The Associated Press Government News U.S. News Business News World News Technology News Entertainment News Sports News Today in History 1917: US enters World War I Fed Photo of the Day NRC Resident Inspector speaks during Career Day Top Stories Kelly promises new DHS morale turnaround, leadership strategy Top Story What makes the 2017 CR the worst yet for defense?

Article Tools Print friendly E-mail story Tip Us Off Comments (0) Share Article Facebook Twitter Google+1 del.icio.us. Digg! Yahoo! Buzz Diigo google newsvine reddit technorati Yahoo! Myspace The equating of expected cuts to UCSB’s budget with the proposed $54 billion military spending hike is right on. Our military, which Trump calls “depleted,” accounts for 23 percent of all federal outlays. When one adds homeland security, veterans services, nuclear weapons, our wars, we reach $900 billion annually. We account for 34 percent of the world’s military spending — more than the next seven countries combined. So , what do we get for this spending? We don’t know. Despite a 1992 law requiring annual audits of all federal agencies, the Department of Defense alone has not complied. It is said to be unauditable. Last December the Washington Post disclosed that the Pentagon buried an internal study showing $125 billion in bureaucratic waste. That exceeds the combined budgets for Education, Health and Human Services, HUD, and the EPA. Who profits? Mostly corporations like Northrup Grumman, Boeing, Lockheed Martin, General Dynamics — which get 80-90 percent of their revenues from government contracts. What taxes do they pay? Well, in 2013 Boeing paid none. What of the $1 trillion nuclear weapons project? Last week the U.S. led a boycott against the UN Nuclear Ban Treaty, a treaty supported by 123 countries. Might this relate to the 2015 mobilization of 718 lobbyists, to the tune of $67 million, to pressure Congress for increased weapons spending? One wonders if Eisenhower, when he warned of the industrial-military complex, imagined how extreme things might become.

Kaloyev, who lost his wife and two children in a devastating plane crash in 2002, had served three years in prison for butchering the man he blamed for their deaths.

The collision lead to the deaths of 71  people and most of them were Russian schoolchildren. Kaloyev’s story has been recreated in the upcoming film Aftermath that will star Arnold Schwarzenegger. Kaloyev, deputy minister of construction in North Ossetia-Alania in Russia, was one of the first to arrive in the town and found the lifeless body of his toddler daughter tangled in trees that broke her fall. The distraught family man found his wife’s body in a corn field and Konstantin’s body in the road in front of a bus shelter. Kaloyev, from Vladikavkaz near the border with Chechnya, had just finished a two-year contract to work as a builder and architect on a project in Barcelona. Most Read in News bare off!

Kaloyev was waiting for them at Barcelona airport when he heard about the tragedy. An insight into his grief came when he published a eulogy online in tribute to his son. He wrote: “(Konstantin) would have become a good, well-educated person, useful to society, were it not for this tragedy, which I cannot get over. “I have no strength.” Kaloyev stopped working and constantly wore black as he entered a period of profound grief. He turned the family home in the Caucasian town of Vladikavkas into a shrine dedicated to his dead wife and children. Getty Images 10 ‘He could have become a good, well-educated person’: Kaloyev created heartbreaking shrines to each of his lost loved ones Getty Images 10 Kaloyev collected up his children’s belongings and arranged them on their beds as he grieved for his family after the crash Heartbreaking photos showed toys on his children’s beds and a box of his wife’s favourite scents. Two years after the tragedy Kaloyev travelled to Switzerland to confront the man he held responsible for the killing. His target Peter Nielsen, 36, was on duty alone in the Zurich control room on the night of the Überlingen crash. He gave only 44 seconds’ warning to a Bashkirian Airlines aircraft and a DHL freight plane that they were too close. The Russian flight from Moscow to Barcelona was carrying 60 passengers and nine crew. Out of the passengers 45 of them were children on a school trip. The  cargo aircraft was piloted by Paul Philips, from Liverpool in the UK, and was on it’s way from Bergamo, Italy, to Brussels, Belgium. It was carrying Mr Philips and his co-pilot. Getty Images 10 Kaloyev lost his wife in the tragic collision that left 45 schoolchildren dead Nielsen was manning two workstations at for a Swiss airspace control company while a colleague rested next door. He failed to spot the planes were going to smash into each other until they less than 60 seconds apart. Neilsen told the passenger plane crew to descend by a 1,000ft. However a second later the crew changed course because their traffic collision avoidance system (TCAS) told them to fly upwards instead. The TCAS on the Boeing cargo plane told its pilot to descend. An investigation found that if both pilots had followed their TCAS instructions the collision would never have happened. However Nielsen repeated his instructions to the Russian plane and the crew ignored the automated warning – causing them to descend into the path of the cargo plane. The planes collided at a near-right angle at 34,890 feet. Getty Images 10 Kaloyev is seen drinking vodka upon his arrival to his hometown of Vladikavkaz after his release from prison Alamy 10 Arnold Schwarzenegger will play a character based on Vitaly Kaloyev in the film Aftermath In the days that followed Nielsen’s failings were made public and he admitted responsibility, saying: “As a father I sense that this loss leaves a gap that will hurt. “On the night of the accident, I was part of a network of people, computers, monitoring and transmission devices and regulations. “All these parts must work together seamlessly and without error, and they must be synchronised. “As an air traffic controller, it is my task and duty to prevent such accidents. “So many children lost their lives and so many hopes for the future were erased.” He was never named in the press but his initials and a photo of his flat appeared in the papers. Nielsen had a nervous break down shortly after the crash and required extensive therapy to help him through his guilt. Getty Images 10 Kaloyev is seen here with his daughter Diana during happier times before the crash At a one-year anniversary memorial event distraught Kaloyev asked the head of Skyguide, which manages airspace in Europe, if he could meet the man who had been responsible for the disaster. He decided to hire a private investigator who managed  to locate Nielsen’s address as being outside Zürich. In 2004 Kayolev arrived in Neilsen’s neighbourhood with a piece of paper with his address on it. He asked a local for directions as she pointed to him the way. Kaloyev then sat down in his garden and waited for the right time to strike. Nielsen spotted the intruder and went outside with his three children to ask him what he wanted. His wife Mette tried to call them back when she heard a “kind of scream”. When she rushed outside she found Nielsen lying on the ground in a pool of his own blood. A 14 inch blade was jutting out his stomach. PA:Press Association 10 Paul Phillips, the British pilot of the DHL Boeing 757, is pictured here with is partner Kayolev went on the run and was stopped at Zurich airport as he tried to leave Switzerland. He later told his trial that he wanted Nielsen to apologise for the mistake that lead to the death of his kids. He told the court he committed the murder after he dropped some pics of his family and it felt like his children had “dropped out of their coffins”. Nielson took roughly two minutes to bleed to death as his child and wife watched on helplessly. During his trial Kaloyev admitted he felt pity for Nielsen’s three children. Kaloyev was sentenced to eight years in prison in 2005 but was released three years later after appealing that his mental health at the time had not been considered. He later told a reporter that: “Killing him didn’t make him feel any better.” The Sun Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window) Comments Comments Most Popular BLAST FROM THE PAST Cheryl 'in tears' after ex husband Ashley Cole sends his best wishes to her and Liam Payne TV & Showbiz PAIN AT THE PUMPS Morrisons HALVES the amount of rewards customers can earn for filling up at its petrol stations Money WHAT SHE DIDN'T WANT YOU TO SEE!

Photo: Reuters mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 1:20 PM, April 7, 2017 Updated: 2:00 PM, April 7, 2017 MOBILE, Ala. - In the years since the 2008 financial crisis, this southern U.S. port city has attracted a new Airbus factory, seen its steel industry retool, and gained thousands of jobs building the Navy's new combat vessel. Some 300 miles north in Huntsville, new businesses sprout in farm fields drawn by readily available land, low taxes, flexible labor rules and improving infrastructure. As President Trump faces pressure to deliver on his promise to revive manufacturing in the northern "rust belt" states that put him in the White House, his biggest challenge may not be Mexico or China, but the southern U.S. states that form the other pillar of his political base. States like Alabama have built a presence in the global supply chain in direct competition with the country's Midwestern industrial heartland, and even if Trump coaxes jobs back to the United States they may well head south rather than north. Whether the "rust belt's" expectations are met will be central to 2018 U.S. mid-term elections and likely frame the presidential race in 2020. The southern states are reliably Republican, but the party's ability to repeat its success in Midwestern swing states, such as Michigan, Ohio and Wisconsin, may hinge on whether the Trump administration delivers on its economic promises. For a decade now, nine southern states - North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Tennessee, Kentucky, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, and Texas - together have accounted for a larger share of the U.S. economy than nine northern states that defined America as the 20th century's industrial superpower, according to a Reuters analysis of federal data. The analysis compared gross domestic product, population and other factors among northern and Midwestern states that played a key role in Trump's victory or are typically considered part of the industrial heartland, with those in the south and along the Gulf Coast that have become an emerging destination for auto and other investment. (For graphic on' A battle for jobs' click: http://tmsnrt.rs/2nHSda5) Florida, a state whose population has boomed under an influx of retirees, many of them from the north, was excluded. FREE LAND AND DEGREES Economists and industrial site consultants say the reasons behind the trend have moved beyond lower wages and lower levels of unionization. Per capita income in the south has now almost caught up with that in the Midwest, and its skilled workforce continues to grow as college graduates move in. "Labor? Perceived advantages. Taxes? Some of these are fairly low (tax) states. Real estate? For big projects that are going to employ three, four, five thousand people, you can find free land - zero cost land," said Darin Buelow, an industrial site specialist with Deloitte Consulting. In the south, business executives and development officials interviewed by Reuters were less likely to call for new tariffs and trade deals than to worry about how any new regime may disrupt a system they have learned to work with. David Fernandes, president of Toyota Motor Manufacturing Alabama, said that of the roughly 700,000 engines the factory made last year, half went to Mexico and Canada. The facility also makes engines for cars assembled at a Toyota plant in Georgetown, Kentucky. "Anything that hinders the opportunity to provide product to a customer is what is concerning," he said. Plants in Kentucky and Indiana gave Toyota a U.S. foothold in the 1980s and 1990s, but in this century the Japanese carmaker turned to Alabama, Texas and Mississippi for expansion. Located on former cotton fields, the company's Huntsville, Alabama, plant now employs more than 1,400 people and churns out about 3,000 engines a day. Gunmaker Remington Outdoor [FREDM.UL] came to Huntsville lured by $110 million in tax and other concessions. Its factory here is expected to eventually employ 2,000, and it has already begun shifting employees from elsewhere, including 100 from the town in upstate New York where the company was founded two centuries ago. Jeremy Littlejohn moved his cloud computing start-up RISC Networks from Chicago to Asheville, NC, in 2012 for the less hectic pace, but has found the location a selling point as he grew from 6 to 33 employees. Many of those new workers came from out of state, contributing to North Carolina's net annual influx of about 46,000 college degree holders. That migration of educated workers is the norm among the southern states. The rust belt by contrast saw a net outflow of more than 400,000 residents with college degrees between 2007 and 2014. The customers are heading south too. From 1990 to 2015, population in the nine southern and gulf states grew 43 percent, to more than 76 million, and passed that of the rust belt states in the late 1990s. Population in the rust belt grew 13 percent, to 63 million, over the same period. When the Minnesota-based Polaris Industries Inc. began planning a new facility for its line of outdoor vehicles, "there was no Minnesota play," said Eric Blackwell, director of operations at the company's new factory outside Huntsville. The market for Polaris' machines, popular for farm work, hunting and sport riding, was growing in the south. Open land was available, and Alabama had programs to help recruit and train a workforce expected to rise to 1,500. FROM LAGGARD TO A RISING TIDE Globalization hit both the north and the south hard. Between 2000 and 2010 each lost about a third of their manufacturing jobs. But employment rebounded faster and more broadly in the south. Between 2000 and 2015, combined private sector employment in nine southern and gulf coast states still grew 13.5 percent. In the nine northern states total private sector jobs as of 2015 remained 1.3 percent below their 2000 level, according to federal data. The transition dates back to the 1980s, when German and Japanese automakers began investing in what has become a sprawling, regional industry. Supplier networks followed, creating even stiffer competition in an industry already changing due to passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and the growth of automaking in Mexico. New industries, such as aerospace, followed. Boeing opened a new factory in Charleston, South Carolina, while decades of federal spending on space and defense programs created a pool of engineers in Alabama. A surge in energy and locally important industries like wood products added to the employment gains. Judith Adams, vice president at the Alabama State Port Authority, speeds visitors through warehouses of wood fiber products, steel ingots and other goods ready to ship abroad. The port is spending $47 million to boost its capacity to 500,000 containers a year from 300,000. The longer-term the goal is to triple that to 1.5 million. "The vessel sizes are getting bigger. The market is getting bigger. The cargo is here," Adams said. When European aircraft maker Airbus scouted sites for its $600 million North American plant more than a decade ago it settled on a former Air Force base in Mobile. As it ramps up production, local officials say 20 suppliers have already arrived in Airbus' wake, with firms like Ireland's Maas Aviation looking to put 150 people to work painting planes. "We looked at transportation costs, labor costs, productivity, and it made sense," said Allan McArtor, chief executive of Airbus Group Inc. "We will be building single aisle airplanes (in Mobile) for a long, long time."

As President Donald Trump‚Äôs choice to be U.S. trade representative, Lighthizer would be empowered to renegotiate and enforce trade deals, many of which the president has condemned as destroyers of American jobs. (AP Photo/Manuel Balce Ceneta, File) WASHINGTON — Robert Lighthizer has long complained that the United States dithered in the face of abusive Chinese trade policies, allowing its trade gap with Beijing to explode and American factories to close. Now, the veteran trade lawyer may have a chance to do something about it. As President Donald Trump's choice to be U.S. trade representative, the 69-year-old Lighthizer would be empowered to renegotiate and enforce trade deals, many of which the new president has condemned as destroyers of American jobs. On Thursday, the Senate Finance Committee postponed a vote on Lighthizer's nomination because two members from Ohio, Republican Rob Portman and Democrat Sherrod Brown, were attending a memorial service at Arlington National Cemetery for the late Ohio Democratic Sen. John Glenn. (His confirmation has been held up by a political dispute over whether he needs a congressional waiver because he has worked for foreign companies. The delay means Lighthizer isn't in his job as Trump prepares to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping in Mar-a-Lago, Florida.) A fixture in Washington trade policy circles for nearly four decades, Lighthizer has built a reputation as a shrewd negotiator. And like the president who chose him, Lighthizer represents a departure for a Republican Party that for decades favoured the free flow of global trade as a boon to economic growth. "I agree with President Trump that we should have an 'America First' trade policy," Lighthizer said at his committee hearing last month. "And that we can do better in negotiating our trade agreements and be stronger at enforcing our trade laws." His nomination sends another signal that the Trump administration intends to upend decades of U.S. policy and act aggressively to block imports when it deems other countries to be acting unfairly. "He's a trade realist," Paul Rosenthal, a trade lawyer at the firm Kelley Drye & Warren. "He doesn't necessarily subscribe to free trade as a religion as some people do." Lighthizer's philosophy, Rosenthal suggests, essentially boils down to: "How can we afford to be unilateral free traders when the Chinese don't reciprocate?" Drawing from experience in trade law and his work in the Reagan administration in countering Japanese imports, Lighthizer will likely try to force China and other competitors to end what the Trump team sees as unfair trade. Supporters of free trade, such as analysts at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, argue that a Trump-Lighthizer combative approach could backfire. Blocking or taxing imports would raise prices of imports for American consumers and provoke retaliation. The result could potentially be a trade war that would hurt U.S. farmers and companies — from Boeing to Caterpillar — that depend on exports. Lighthizer won't be the administration's only trade policy heavyweight. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, a billionaire investor, is expected to involve himself in trying to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico and other trade issues. And Trump named Peter Navarro, a vociferous critic of Chinese trade policy, to lead a new White House National Trade Council. Could Lighthizer be overshadowed? "The words 'overshadow' and 'Bob Lighthizer' shouldn't appear in the same sentence," says Clyde Prestowitz, a Commerce official in the Reagan administration and a longtime critic of U.S. trade policy. Lighthizer has more congressional contacts and more experience with the fine points of trade law than Navarro or Ross. In 2008, he wrote a column in The New York Times criticizing Sen. John McCain, the Republican presidential candidate, for his unstinting support of free trade. Lighthizer noted that "conservative statesmen from Alexander Hamilton to Ronald Reagan sometimes supported protectionism." "They always understood that trade policy was merely a tool for building a strong and independent country with a prosperous middle class," he wrote. Lighthizer's confirmation vote had been delayed by a political rift: Some Democrats argued that he must obtain a waiver from Congress because he has worked in the past for foreign clients. They said they would support the waiver only if Republicans pass an unrelated bill to protect the endangered pension and health care benefits of retired coal miners. Lighthizer served as a top aide on the Senate Finance Committee under Sen. Bob Dole in the late 1970s and early 1980s and later as treasurer of Dole's 1996 Republican presidential campaign. (The 93-year-old Dole introduced Lighthizer at his committee hearing.) Under Reagan, Lighthizer served as deputy trade representative. Despite Reagan's reputation as a stalwart supporter of free trade, his administration seldom hesitated to pressure U.S. trade partners if it thought American manufacturers were being hurt. Lighthizer played a key role, for example, in strong-arming Japan into limiting auto exports in the 1980s. That move eventually led Japanese automakers to open plants in the United States, thereby creating U.S. jobs, instead of shipping all its cars from Japan. Later in private practice — he became a senior partner in international trade at Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom — Lighthizer represented U.S. steel companies that complained that China and other countries were dumping underpriced steel on the U.S. market. In 2010 testimony to U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, he lambasted U.S. trade officials as too passive in the face of China's economic rise. When it negotiated China's 2001 entry into the World Trade Organization — which sets trade rules and mediates disputes — Washington naively assumed that China was "merely a more exotic version of Canada" and would learn to live within WTO rules and open its market to American exports, Lighthizer argued. Instead, he contended, China limited foreign competition, manipulated its currency and subsidized its exporters to give them a price advantage. The notion that having China in the WTO would benefit Americans, Lighthizer concluded, "was simply wrong. Our trade deficit with China has exploded, millions of U.S. manufacturing jobs have been lost." Trump campaigned on a promise to renegotiate or withdraw from agreements that he says failed American workers. But Dean Pinkert, formerly of the U.S. International Trade Commission, says he thinks Lighthizer will seek better ways to use existing agreements before tearing them up. In his 2010 testimony, Lighthizer had said the U.S. should more aggressively scour WTO rules for new ways to bring cases against China — for manipulating its currency, say. Alan Wolff, a deputy U.S. trade representative in the Carter administration, says China and other U.S. trading partners should brace themselves. Under Lighthizer, Wolff says, "trade policy is going to get a lot more muscular."       E-mail this Article Print this Article Share this Article           Story Tools   E-mail this Article Print this Article Share this Article   Font: * * * * *   Image: * * * *   Previous Next     FILE - In this Tuesday, March 14, 2017, file photo, United States Trade Representative-nominee Robert Lighthizer testifies before the Senate Finance Committee during his confirmation hearing on Capitol Hill in Washington.

Here we take a closer look at the winners as well as the most futuristic aircraft interior designs that were unveiled at this year’s event. Delta One Suite Category: Cabin Concepts Delta Air Lines took the top prize in this year’s Cabin Concepts category with its Delta One Suite design, which lends a “first class feel to business class travel” offering private areas with privacy partitions. Due to be installed on its Airbus A350 aircraft this autumn, it is said to be the first business class cabin to feature a sliding door for every seat. Other highlighted features include an in-flight entertainment system and “thoughtfully designed” stowage areas. Delta One Suite The major US airline usurped rival American carrier United Airlines, the world’s third largest airline, whose Polaris Lounge design, offering aisle access from every seat, was among those shortlisted. Smart Cabin Reconfiguration Category: Passenger Comfort Hardware Airbus, one of the world’s largest aircraft manufacturers, saw a total of four entries shortlisted at this year’s awards, including its winning Smart Cabin Reconfiguration concept, designed in collaboration with German aircraft manufacturer Recaro. Airbus's Smart Cabin Configuration concept features folding seats The folding seat design would allow cabin crew to adapt the seat configuration according to the real-time passenger count for every flight and maximise cabin space for optimal passenger comfort. The innovative new seats, which could be easily adjusted by cabin crew even without any prior mechanical expertise, would also reduce downtime for seat layout changes which are normally said to require a day to implement. A nifty convertible bar/galley from Diehl Comfort Modules was among those commended in the Passenger Comfort Hardware category, for its design of an aircraft kitchenette which could be transformed into a bar or duty-free sales counter in seconds, while Canadian transport company Bombardier was shortlisted for its concept of “barrier-free toilets”. A rendering of the Octaspring Octaspring Category: Material & Components A “revolutionary” lightweight seat cushion designed by Vanema, in collaboration with Boxmark, won this year’s Materials & Components category for its potential to offer increased passenger comfort on long-haul flights. Using 30 per cent less material and reducing the seat cushion’s weight by up to 32 per cent (depending on the aircraft), the Octaspring cushions have been made with foam springs that move in three dimensions, offering a more customised seat that “reduces pressure points, evenly distributing body weight and improving seat ergonomics”, the company claims. Smart Onboard Wheelchair Category: University An innovative lightweight in-flight wheelchair concept from the Hamburg University of Applied Sciences (HAW), which claims to provide “easy and efficient cabin aisle mobility”, took the top prize for the University category. A rendering of the Smart Onboard Wheelchair which could fit over the toilet seat The uniquely designed seat features an “over toilet functionality” allowing it to be fit over the toilet bowl. “Current Onboard Wheelchairs (OBW) require more lavatory space for their usage. Most lavatories especially in single aisle aircraft are not OBW accessible so far. The Smart OBW is the only wheelchair that fits above a toilet bowl and eliminates the need to transfer the user onto the toilet seat,” the company said. The wheelchair design beat previous winner Delft’s “Revitalisation System” which “turns the cabin seating upholstery into a game controller, with body movements whilst sitting controlling the on-board entertainment system.” Airbus's ReTrolley - a "recycler on wheels" ReTrolley Category: Greener Cabin, Health, Safety and Environment Airbus’s second winning concept was the ReTrolley design, which features a trolley that could both recycle and compress passengers’ rubbish as it passes through the aisle. The “recycler on wheels” would replace standard bin trolleys, reduce the aircraft’s total waste volume by 30 per cent, and up to 30kg in equipment weight without the use of electronic compressors and free up space in the galley. GermaFalcon, from the US manufacturer of the same name, a cabin cleaning device which claims to “instantly” kill bacteria, viruses and superbugs on aircraft seats and other exposed surfaces using only ultraviolet C light, was among the other finalists, joined by the Revolution Toilet concept from French aircraft equipment manufacturer Zodiac Aerospace which also claims to tackle bacteria. Airtime Portal would allow passengers to stream video, browse the internet and read digital magazines from their own devices Airtime Portal Category: Electronic Systems Global Eagle Entertainment took the top prize for the Electronic Systems category with Airtime Portal, a wireless in-flight entertainment system which would allow passengers to browse the internet, stream video and read digital magazines on their own personal electronic devices. The design was followed by Airbus’s WAIC (Wireless Avionics Intra-Communications) concept which offers smoke detectors, lighting and temperature regulation controlled by a radio frequency, without the need for cables. Power Line Communication Category: Cabin Systems Diehl Aerospace won the award for its Power Line Communication concept where the aircraft’s existing cables could also be used as a distribution network for both power and data, offering a significant reduction in aircraft wiring, weight and volume. The design trumped Zodiac Aerospace’s concept for a light sensor above the overhead lockers that would indicate the availability of free cabin baggage space, which was among the finalists, along with Airbus’s Watchdog sensor design which would send out an alert whenever there was movement near the door handle of the plane, to avoid accidental activation of the emergency escape chutes when the aircraft doors are opened on the ground. A rendering of the future first class cabins on board Airbus's A380 aircraft Following last month’s news of the A380’s replacement of its wide staircase, Airbus unveiled its New Forward Stairs (NFS) design at this year’s Aircraft Interiors Expo, which aims to optimise cabin space and free up the A380’s floor for 20 additional passengers across business, premium economy and economy. Airbus's New Forward Staircase feature on the A380 This new feature of the world’s largest commercial aircraft would be joined by several other tweaks including an 11-abreast 3-5-3 economy seating layout on the main deck (but maintaining an 18-inch seat width), the relocation of stairs to the upper deck and adjacent lower-deck crew-rest areas and the removal of sidewall stowages. The changes would allow for a total of around 80 more passengers including 23 more in economy, 11 more in premium economy (with a nine-abreast layout), 10 more in business and 14 more following a redesign of the rear stair of the galley. New Tourist Class seats to be installed on Dreamliner aircraft CREDIT: LIFT BY ENCORE Boeing, in collaboration with Lift by EnCore, also revealed a new wide-body economy seat design for its 787 Dreamliner aircraft. The new Tourist Class seat features screens set in a cove and would be equipped with a lighting system that is synchronised with the aircraft’s lighting system for boarding, dusk, and meal times. The major American aircraft manufacturer also announced plans to install a “next generation photoluminescent emergency floor path marking system” ( saf-Tglo® SuperSeal UltraLite ), designed in collaboration with STG Aerospace, on its Dreamliner aircraft. Air New Zealand's new middle seat design offers three centimetres more width on board its new A320 and A321 aircraft Air New Zealand's new middle seat design offers three centimetres more width on board its new A320 and A321 aircraft Air New Zealand also showcased a new spacious design for the unpopular middle seat, which gives it three centimetres more width space, while the widths of window and aisle seats were also expanded by one centimetre each. The wider seats will be installed on the airline’s new A320 and A321 aircraft which are expected to be delivered by 2018.

But the problems didn't end there James Moore Chief Business Commentator @JimMooreJourno Thursday 6 April 2017 17:03 BST Click to follow The Independent Online Finding the key to the money maze isn't easy Rex Regular readers may remember that I took the time to detail my dismal ISA experience a couple of days ago.  The aim was chiefly to make a point about how the misnamed financial “services” industry and its regulators conspire to skewer people who attempt to follow the urgings of Government and others by saving to provide for their futures.  It was the first time in a while that I’ve engaged with anything much more complicated than a bank account, despite having spent a number of years writing about personal finance earlier in my career, and it wasn’t a happy experience. While I did ultimately get an ISA set up, albeit not the one I initially wanted (I was defeated by a combination of my bank and the ISA provider’s spat with MasterCard),  it was an eye opening experience, and not in a good way. Here are some of the issues it raised. Read more Savings nightmare: My dismal ISA experience How to pick the perfect ISA The Help to Buy ISA fails everyone but the already wealthy Weird and scary things are happening One of the first problems I had with my first choice ISA provider was getting flagged as a politically sensitive person by the company it uses to screen applicants to ensure it complies with the City watchdog’s “know your customer” rules. Mercifully, this was not because of my liberal (small l) political views and passionate opposition to Brexit. It would be really scary if Brexiteer ministers stooped to that level (mind you…) No, having made some inquiries, I was told I was flagged as a “false positive”. No reason was given for why this might have occurred but I did discover that it isn’t just me that this has happened to. If you think about how our data is shared and stored and sold, and about the snooping that the Government does, the implications of my getting falsely tagged as politically sensitive are ever so slightly disturbing. There is too much choice. Far far too much choice The ISA I finally took out was provided by Legal & General. I picked the firm because it has a range of reasonably competitively price funds that track stock market indices, which I’d recommend for anyone dipping their toes into these waters because pricer funds that aim to beat the market rarely do so over the long term. I also liked the fact that L&G, by contrast to some of its peers, has been willing to use the power it has in the market it has, by dint the investments we make, to oppose some of the crazier pay packages companies hand to their CEOs. Thing is, L&G doesn’t just do trackers. It, in fact, has 84 different funds to choose from. And L&G is just one ISA provider. There are many others. Some companies provide “wrapper” ISAs so you can pick from across nearly the entire market. It’s a wonder how even professionals, whose lives are devoted to evaluating funds, can make sense of the bewildering array on offer, let alone Joe Pubic, or even the average financial advisor they might feel inclined to approach.  There’s too much information out there Yep, we in the media are partially at fault for this. There are endless articles out there containing advice on what to do, and lots of them are very good. Personal finance journalism might not be terribly glamorous, but the people I know in the trade work hard at it, and genuinely care about doing well by their readers. But I fear the novice punter, presented with the trove of information available from five minutes of Googling, might be left scratching their head. How to tell the wood from the trees? The Government doesn’t help When the Blair Government launched the ISA it also came up with a scheme designed to highlight those which ticked boxes regarding their costs, the access to funds they offered, the terms investors would get. The CAT mark scheme was, however, a flop. There was no logo for CAT marked funds, and little in the way of promotion. Having launched the CAT mark, ministers walked away, scared to be seen to be endorsing products that can, when all is said and done, lose money for the people who buy them. Shame really, because the principle of giving a star to cheap and simple funds might be a good idea as long as the punter understands the risks.

As a result of the US trade embargo and other inefficiencies of Cuba's economy, thousands of basic household items are inaccessible to Cubans meaning that sometimes a little creativity is required to get the job done. At El Canal, a winery in Havana, Orestes Estevez and his family fill glass jugs with grapes, ginger and hibiscus, before securing a condom over each glass jug Allowing Heathrow to expand will create “a serious obstacle” to meeting the UK’s commitments on climate change and reducing air pollution, a leading scientist has warned. AP 3/33 'Pink Star' diamond sells for world record £57m in Hong Kong auction - Tuesday April 4 A rare pink diamond dubbed the “Pink Star” has become the world's most expensive gemstone to sell at auction, coming under the hammer in Hong Kong on Tuesday for $71.2m (£57.3m). The oval-cut 59.6 carat jewel, discovered in a mine in Africa by De Beers in 1999, is the largest fancy vivid pink diamond, categorised as “flawless” or “internally flawless”, that the Gemological Institute of America (GIA) has ever graded. It sold after a five-minute bidding war, that started at $56m, to Hong Kong jewellery retailer Chow Tai Fook at Sotheby's. AP 4/33 Stopping climate change could boost the world economy by £15 trillion - Tuesday March 21 Efforts to slow climate change won’t just keep the planet habitable. They will also boost the world economy by $19 trillion (£15.2 trillion). Investments in renewable power and energy efficiency will add about 0.8 per cent to global gross domestic product by 2050, the International Renewable Energy Agency, or Irena, said Monday in a report produced for the German government. Governments are committing resources to green energy in a bid to keep warming within 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit), of pre-industrial conditions, in accordance with the landmark Paris Agreement on global warming. Getty 5/33 'UK Disneyland' set to open in five years in Kent - Friday March 10 It’s the news British film-lovers and thrill-seekers have been waiting to hear forever - no longer do we have to schlep across the seas to get our fix of stardust and adrenaline, for the UK is finally getting its own ‘Disneyland’. The theme park will be the first of its kind in the UK, and is being created by film company Paramount at a cost of £3.5 billion. Paramount 6/33 John Lewis cuts staff bonuses to lowest in 63 years despite soaring profits - Thursday March 9 John Lewis has cut its employee bonus to the lowest level in more than 60 years despite announcing surging profits. The partnership, which is owned by its employees, reduced the bonus to 6 per cent of salaries making it the lowest since 1954. It is the fourth year in a row that the payment has been cut. Pre-tax profits rose 21.2 per cent to £370.4m as overall sales rose 3.2 per cent but the group said it cut staff bonuses because of an “increasingly uncertain” market. Reuters 7/33 Philip Hammond downgrades UK economic growth for Brexit years - Wednesday March 8 The Chancellor was forced to slash his official economic growth forecasts while the Brexit talks take place, as he delivered his first Budget. Philip Hammond told MPs that Britain’s economy would grow faster than previously expected in the next financial year – by 2 per cent, up from 1.4 per cent. PA 8/33 UK businesses are already facing recruitment crisis as Polish workers head home - Friday February 15 After a Brexit vote in which a primary concern was too much immigration, some might be applauding the trend, but for important UK industries it is already creating a serious problem, and one that provides a preview of what may be to come for the wider economy. Reuters 9/33 Global sales of UK food and drink hit the £20bn mark for the first time - Tuesday February 21 Global sales of UK food and drink have hit the £20bn mark for the first time in history, as the Government prepares to ramp up its focus on international trade following the UK’s decision to leave the EU. Getty 10/33 Plastics industry 'pressured UK Government to cut recycling targets' - Friday February 17 Recycling targets in the UK were cut last year after successful lobbying from the plastics industry, a freedom of information request by Greenpeace has revealed. The Government came under fire last year after it announced that targets for plastic recycling would be reduced from 57 per cent to a mere 49 per cent for 2016 and then increased by 2 per cent each year to 2020, to a maximum of 57 per cent by 2020. AFP/Getty 11/33 Inflation hits 1.8% as post-Brexit pound weakness feeds through to high street - Tuesday February 14 UK consumer price inflation jumped to 1.8 per cent in the year to January, from a rise of 1.6 per cent in the year to December, as the slump in the pound since the Brexit referendum continued to trickle through to the high street. According to data from the Office for National Statistics published on Tuesday, January’s rise was the biggest since June 2014. But the jump narrowly missed analyst expectations for a 1.9 per cent increase, just below the Bank of England’s official 2 per cent target. Getty Images 12/33 Lettuce crisis hits those who love it most: hungry British sea turtles - Friday February 10 The UK’s vegetable crisis has not only gripped the country’s supermarkets and healthy eaters, but also a bale of 12 hungry green sea turtles in aquariums across the country. Eight aquariums run by the company Sea Life are calling on visitors to spare lettuce or broccoli for their shelled inhabitants who, as a result of a shortage of some vegetables in the UK, are missing out on their favourite meals.

Tim Cook met Ms May at Downing Street on Thursday morning and reiterated the tech giant's plans to build a new UK headquarters at the Battersea Power Station as proof of the company's support of the UK. Getty 14/33 Brexit: Bank of England upgrades growth forecasts but still expects UK economy to be hit - Thursday Ferbruary 2 The Bank of England has dramatically upgraded its growth forecast for this year but stressed that households will still experience a major squeeze on incomes due to rising inflation. In its latest Inflation Report, the Bank upgraded its 2017 GDP growth forecast to 2 per cent, up from 1.4 per cent in November. The revision is certain to be seized upon by Brexiteers as evidence that the economy will not suffer from leaving the European Union and that previous economic warnings from the Bank have now been exposed as scaremongering. Yet the Bank’s forecasts continue to project a growth slowdown in 2018 and 2019, with GDP expected to expand by 1.6 per cent and 1.7 per cent in those years.

Getty Good advice is hard to find (and expensive)  That’s actually nothing new. There are some useful tools available to help you navigate the maze, and companies like Hargreaves Lansdown offer model portfolios of funds their experts select, with different levels of risk attached, that you can sign up to if you’re happy to take their choices on trust. But basically, you’re on your own, unless you have a lot of money to invest, which should facilitate access to higher quality advisors. I remain of the view that the best option for the novice investor looking for a better long term return than is provided by the pitiful rates of interest offered by bank or building savings accounts, is an index tracker fund, assuming they can find one amidst the huge range of funds they will be offered. Lots of younger people are going to embark on this difficult journey through the new Long Term ISA, to save for things like deposits on houses. This could all go horribly wrong I wonder how they’ll feel about investing after a few years. It’ll be ok if the stock market rises, and their chosen funds do ok. But what if that doesn’t happen? I wish them the best of luck because it’s very much a case of cross your fingers and hope it works out. Assuming, that is, you don’t end up falsely tagged as “politically sensitive”. If that happens to you, welcome to the club. Scary, isn’t it.  More about: best ISA Long term ISA Personal Finances Investments Long-term Savings Reuse content Comments Most Popular Video Sponsored Features Follow us: User Policies Privacy Policy Cookie Policy Code of Conduct Complaint Form Contact Us Contributors All Topics Archive Newsletters Jobs Subscriptions Advertising Guide Syndication Evening Standard Novaya Gazeta Install our Apps We use cookies to enhance your visit to our site and to bring you advertisements that might interest you.

Space Stellar echoes, Venusian automatons and more gain NASA moonshot funding Amazon’s Jeff Bezos sells $1B in stock annually to fund space company Blue Origin SpaceX spent ‘less than half’ the cost of a new first stage on Falcon 9 relaunch Browse more... Blue Origin’s first crewed test flights probably won’t happen until 2018 Posted 17 hours ago by Darrell Etherington (@etherington) 0 SHARES Next Story Flow adds funding from Forerunner and Fung Capital to tackle cross-border commerce Blue Origin, the spaceflight company founded by Amazon’s Jeff Bezos, had originally been aiming for late 2017 as the target gate to begin sending human crew up to space aboard its rockets, with the aim of beginning commercial tourist rocket rides in 2018. The 2018 target remains in place for initial commercial service, but Blue Origin is now looking more likely to start test flights in 2018, rather than later this year. Bezos told reporters that it he doesn’t think it’s going to happen in 2017, as planned, though it still “could be” possible. Bezos said that the company will “put humans on it when we’re happy,” according to Space News, regardless of any previously stated timelines. Should testing prove to proceed more quickly at a level Blue Origin is comfortable with, end of year crew testing isn’t out of the question. Still, Bezos stressed multiple times during the news conference at the  33rd annual Space Symposium in Colorado that Blue Origin is “not racing” to put people into space, and that the team will not take “any shortcuts,” and will ultimately “put humans on this vehicle when we’re ready and not a second sooner.” Tickets for Blue Origins initial commercial tourist flights will go on sale closer to that program’s launch, he added, and there’s no pricing attached to that yet, though Richard Branson’s Virgin Galactic tickets run around $250,000 per, and it’s likely that Blue Origin’s fare will be in the same ballpark. SpaceX’s crewed testing date has also been pushed back to 2018 from an initial target of 2017, and Boeing’s CST-100 Starliner is also looking at 2018 as the timeframe to begin crewed launch tests. The way this is shaping up, 2018 could be a very busy year in terms of American companies sending people to space for the first time. 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Newsletter Subscriptions The Daily Crunch Get the top tech stories of the day delivered to your inbox TC Weekly Roundup Get a weekly recap of the biggest tech stories Crunchbase Daily The latest startup funding announcements Enter Address Subscribe SEE ALL NEWSLETTERS » Latest Crunch Report Yahoo and AOL combine to become Oath | Crunch Report Watch More Episodes Space Popular Posts Featured Stories Jeff Bezos Sells $1B in Amazon Stock Annually to Fund Blue Origin | Crunch Report VIDEO | 4:05 Transcript: Phil Schiller, Craig Federighi and John Ternus on the state of Apple’s pro Macs 11 hours ago | Matthew Panzarino, Romain Dillet 23andMe is finally allowed to tell you if you have the genes for Parkinson’s 12 hours ago | Sarah Buhr Facebook Messenger’s AI ‘M’ suggests features to use based on your convos 14 hours ago | Josh Constine New Google tool helps developers pick the right colors for their apps 14 hours ago | Frederic Lardinois Latest From TechCrunch Crunch Report | Jeff Bezos Sells $1B in Amazon Stock Annually to Fund Blue Origin 4 hours ago | Khaled "Tito" Hamze Trump plans to nominate Lyft’s Derek Kan to transportation department 4 hours ago | Megan Rose Dickey SkyX drones are half-helicopter, half-plane and built to fly long distances 7 hours ago | Lora Kolodny The leaked DJI Spark looks to be the Mavic Pro’s little brother 7 hours ago | Matt Burns Comment moderation powered by Up Next Flow adds funding from Forerunner and Fung Capital to tackle cross-border commerce Posted 18 hours ago CrunchBoard Job Listings CEO.

Facebook Twitter Google + Email Print Trump hosts China’s Xi Jinping at Mar-a-Lago By Gregory Hellman 04/06/17 08:30 AM EDT With Zach Montellaro, Connor O’Brien and Jacqueline Klimas DRIVING THE DAY — TRUMP MEETS CHINA’S XI JINPING, writes The New York Times: “When President Xi Jinping of China arrives at President Trump’s Florida estate on Thursday, his goal will be to get through the quick visit looking like a resolute leader who can hold his own against the American president, something that even some of Washington’s closest allies have failed to pull off…” Story Continued Below “Events began to veer off script on Wednesday as North Korea fired an intermediate range ballistic missile into waters off its east coast, a defiant move that seemed intended to exacerbate differences between Mr. Trump and Mr. Xi. “Mr. Xi is likely to play down potential conflicts, offering vague assurances on trade and North Korea’s nuclear provocations that he believes Mr. Trump will want to hear but that may not amount to significant policy changes. At the same time, however, he will not want to look as though he is backing down or being lectured. For the Chinese, the atmospherics of the talks will be as important as the substance.” — PACIFIC FLEET COMMANDER: NORTH KOREA DIPLOMACY UNSUCCESSFUL, Reuters reports: “Diplomatic and economic measures taken to rein in North Korea's missile program have not had the desired effect, a senior U.S. military commander said on Thursday after the North's latest test triggered a flurry of calls among world leaders. “U.S. President Donald Trump led calls with leaders and senior officials from Japan and South Korea on Thursday to discuss the latest provocation from Pyongyang, hours before Trump begins a much-anticipated summit with Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping. "’Up to this point I think it is fair to say ... that economic and diplomatic efforts have not supported the progress people have been anticipating and looking forward to,’ U.S. Pacific Fleet Commander Admiral Scott Swift said in Tokyo, where he was meeting Japanese Self Defence Force commanders and foreign ministry officials.” TRUMP OUSTS BANNON FROM NSC, reports POLITICO: “White House chief strategist Steve Bannon has been removed from an important seat on the National Security Council — a posting that had stirred controversy for placing one of President Donald Trump’s top political hands in a key national security position. “The change represents the first real diminution of authority for Bannon, who has been cast as an all-powerful whisperer to Trump in the administration’s first 75 days, mocked by his critics as ‘President Bannon.’ “In recent weeks, Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law and senior adviser, has asked searching questions — sometimes for hours — of inside and outside advisers about the White House's performance and complained about Bannon in particular, according to people who have spoken with Kushner. Kushner, a onetime New York Democrat, and Bannon, a hard-right nationalist, have clashed as Kushner has told people that Bannon’s desire to deconstruct the government is hurting the president…” “‘Big fight is between nationalists and the ‘West Wing Democrats,'’” one senior administration official said.” — AND MCMASTER SOLIDIFIES CONTROL, writes our colleague Bryan Bender: “Trump's directive reorganizing the National Security Council gives McMaster the lines of authority and independence he sought when offered the job and restores the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Joe Dunford, as a regular member of the NSC, along with the director of national intelligence, former senator Dan Coats. “An administration official with direct knowledge of the deliberations said the changes are part of broader reforms McMaster is implementing, including reducing the size of the NSC's professional staff, which ballooned to about 450 under President Barack Obama. “It's also seen as a major victory in reviving the so-called ‘Scowcroft model,’ in which the national security adviser avoids pushing his own policy agenda in favor of serving as a referee for proposals put forth by NSC staff and the career professionals from national security and foreign policy agencies that also participate in high-level meetings.” HAPPY THURSDAY AND WELCOME TO MORNING DEFENSE, where we're always on the lookout for tips, pitches and feedback.

HAPPENING TODAY — SASC HEARS FROM SOUTHCOM AND NORTHCOM: The Senate Armed Services Committee receives testimony from the commanders of U.S. Southern and Northern Commands, Navy Adm. Kurt Tidd and Air Force Gen. Lori Robinson. — AND HASC EVALUATES DEFENSE AUDITING: The House Armed Services Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee hears from Defense Contract Audit Agency Director Anita Bales and others to evaluate the defense contract audit process. In prepared remarks obtained by our colleague Jacqueline Klimas, Subcommittee Chairwoman Vicky Hartzler (R-Mo.) says she plans to probe how DCAA audit practices compare to those in the private sector. The hearing comes following a report from the Center for Strategic and International Studies that contract obligations across the Defense Department rose by 7 percent in fiscal 2016, Jacqueline writes. TRUMP: SYRIA CHEMICAL ATTACK CROSSED ‘MANY, MANY LINES,’ via POLITICO’s Madeline Conway, Austin Wright and Nahal Toosi: “President Donald Trump on Wednesday said the recent chemical weapons attack in Syria ‘crossed many, many lines’ for him, and he said his attitude toward Syria and President Bashar Assad had ‘changed very much’ as a result. “‘It crossed a lot of lines for me,’ Trump told reporters during a news conference at the White House with the king of Jordan. ‘When you kill innocent children, innocent babies, babies, little babies, with a chemical gas that is so lethal ... that crosses many, many lines, beyond a red line. Many, many lines’... “The president declined to say Wednesday whether he plans to intervene in Syria directly but, describing himself as a ‘very flexible person,’ said his opinion on the issue had shifted. “‘I will tell you, that attack on children yesterday had a big impact on me. Big impact,’ Trump said. ‘It's very, very possible — and I will tell you, it's already happened — that my attitude toward Syria and Assad has changed very much.’” Trump’s ‘red line’ reversal hints at a Syria policy shift, POLITICO's Michael Crowley writes. And Trump’s ‘America First’ foreign policy faces its first real test in Syria, adds The Washington Post. — U.S. AMBASSADOR TO THE U.N. NIKKI HALEY URGES ACTION, reports POLITICO’s Nolan D. McCaskill: “Nikki Haley, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, on Wednesday urged action from the U.N. Security Council in response to Tuesday’s deadly chemical weapons attack in Syria…” “‘We saw rows of lifeless bodies, some still in diapers, some with visible scars of a chemical weapons attack. Look at those pictures. We cannot close our eyes to those pictures. We cannot close our minds of the responsibility to act,’” Haley said. “Haley did not specify what action should be taken, however, and the United States has not indicated what it will do in response to the attack.” Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark) says Trump should oust Assad using military or covert action, POLITICO’s Kelsey Sutton adds.

The vote was 22-5, sending the nomination of the former Republican congresswoman from New Mexico to the Senate floor for final consideration.” SASC ranking Democrat Jack Reed was one of the five no votes. In a statement following the vote, Reed said he still has "serious concerns" about ethics issues surrounding Wilson's time in the House and as a consultant for Lockheed subsidiary Sandia Corporation. "Dr. Wilson is a very accomplished individual, but she is the wrong person for this job," Reed said. ARMY CHIEF: A NEW CR WOULD BE ‘PROFESSIONAL MALPRACTICE,’ Connor reports: “Army Chief of Staff Gen. Mark Milley had harsh words for lawmakers today over their failure to enact a full-year defense funding bill, calling the possibility of an extended continuing spending resolution ‘professional malpractice.’ "’Candidly, the failure to pass a budget, in my view as both an American citizen and the chief of staff of the United States Army, constitutes professional malpractice,’ Milley told the House Armed Services Committee.” And Committee Chairman Mac Thornberry (R-Texas) says he won’t vote for one, Connors adds. SPOTTED: Former HASC Chairman Buck McKeon (R-Calif.) working the room ahead of Wednesday's hearing. McKeon, who retired from Congress in 2015, is now a lobbyist leading his own government relations firm, the McKeon Group. TRUMP SUGGESTS TOP OBAMA ADVISER RICE COMMITTED CRIME, reports the NYT: “President Trump said on Wednesday that he thought that the former national security adviser Susan E. Rice may have committed a crime by seeking the identities of Trump associates who were swept up in the surveillance of foreign officials by American spy agencies and that other Obama administration officials may also have been involved. “The president provided no evidence to back his claim. Current and former intelligence officials from both Republican and Democratic administrations have said that nothing they have seen led them to believe that Ms. Rice’s actions were unusual or unlawful.” FOR YOUR RADAR — TILLERSON TO MEET LAVROV WEDNESDAY IN MOSCOW, reports POLITICO’s Madeline Conway: “Secretary of State Rex Tillerson will travel to Moscow next Wednesday for a meeting with Russian officials, including the Kremlin’s foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov. Tillerson plans to discuss issues including Ukraine, North Korea, Syria, and counterterrorism with the officials while in Moscow, according to the State Department.” NAVY GROUNDS T-45 TRAINERS, writes The Washington Post: “The Navy Department has grounded its entire fleet of T-45 trainer jets after instructor pilots raised concerns about the ability of aviators to breathe in them while flying, military officials said, expanding the scope of safety concerns about U.S. military aircraft. “Senior Navy officials made the decision amid problems with ‘physiological episodes,’ said Cmdr. Jeanette Groeneveld, a Navy spokeswoman. The term defines incidents in which the amount of oxygen a pilot breathes is reduced or contaminated or a cockpit is depressurized, causing lightheadedness and, in the worst cases, blackouts.” HOUSE SENDS VA CHOICE EXTENSION TO TRUMP, via Connor: “The House today approved and sent to President Donald Trump legislation that would extend the Veterans' Choice Program past its expected August expiration. The bill was passed by a voice vote, following similar approval in the Senate. “If signed by the president, as expected, the legislation would eliminate the August sunset date for the program and allow the VA to spend the nearly $1 billion left from an initial $10 billion in emergency funding dedicated to Choice.” TOP DOC — A RISING CHINA EYES THE MIDEAST: In a report obtained by POLITICO in advance of its release, the Century Foundation writes that recent moves by China signal their greater security and diplomatic engagement in the Middle East.

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars AI Why job-killing automation may not be all that bad Barb Darrow, Fortune April 6, 2017 12:48 AM Tags: automation Image Credit: maxuser / Shutterstock Fears that automation will kill more jobs continues to grow. An estimated 5 million U.S. factory jobs have evaporated since 2000 and most of those (88%) were lost to increased productivity due to automation, according to a study by Ball State University. But opinions about what, if anything, can be done to reverse the trend differ greatly. Real estate billionaire Jeff Greene, who hosted his second Managing the Disruption conference on the topic of job destruction and what to do about it in Palm Beach, Fla., this week, has some ideas. Last year, he raised a ruckus by saying that robotics and artificial intelligence would kill not just blue-collar factory jobs but also many white-collar careers. Paralegals, journalists, airline pilots, even surgeons could be impacted, for example. Greene continued the drumbeat last week in a Washington Post article, warning that automation will kill jobs much faster than Steven Mnuchin, President Donald Trump’s Treasury secretary, expects. Last week Mnuchin said, controversially, that he didn’t think major automation-related job losses would kick in for another 50 to 100 years. In contrast, a recent report by consultancy PricewaterhouseCoopers estimates that 38% of U.S. jobs have a “high risk” of being wiped out by automation by 2030. Greene’s take is that automation isn’t entirely bad if it can be perfected and deployed to lower the cost of living for the middle class so that they wouldn’t need to earn as much money to get by. For example, using 3-D printers to build homes could cut the cost of housing to a more manageable level so that families wouldn’t have to devote most of their income to mortgage payments, Greene told Fortune on Wednesday. If machines could 3-D print homes using high-density resins, a structure that now costs $200,000 might cost $50,000, Greene said. That would take a big chunk of debt off the table for most families, he said. Another huge drain on family budgets is energy. Part of that problem could be solved by using alternative energy. Families could save money if the U.S. used solar energy to power electric cars and heat homes. Of course that assumes that the cost of alternatives goes lower than the cost of oil. The net impact, in his opinion, is that a couple would no longer have to work 80 to 90 hours a week to pay the bills. And if they can live on less money, the need for a two-income household is lessened, allowing one parent to stay home with any children. That, in turn, reduces the risk of children turning to drugs or getting pregnant. Greene acknowledges that his ideas are “possibly Utopian” in that he’s seeing the use of automation that poses risks to workers across the spectrum in the best possible light. Many who worry about automation also tout universal basic income as a way to make up for lost jobs. In this scenario, all citizens who are too young for Social Security would receive a flat annual payment from the federal government. It’s a trendy idea in Silicon Valley and other tech enclaves, where it’s seen as a way to hedge against automation-induced job losses. One small problem: It is unaffordable, according to former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers, who spoke at this week’s event. It would cost about $5 trillion annually, or about $4 trillion more than the country’s annual income tax revenue, to pay each American adult $25,000 a year. “It’s almost impossible to make the arithmetic work,” Summers said, according to The Palm Beach Post. Others see hope in smaller, more tactical steps, like improving tech education for students and re-training current workers. Last week, General Electric contributed $50 million to the Boston Public Schools to improve science technology engineering and math (STEM) education to train students to help fill what the company sees as a gaping skills gap. That’s a step in the right direction, but retraining people on a much broader scale is needed to address skills gap nation-wide. There does not seem to be much desire in the Republican-controlled Congress to boost funding on education. Others say technologies like augmented reality, which layers information onto the real world through connected eyeglasses or goggles, could help. For example, field repair technicians could get diagrams and instructions, even video, projected into their goggles so that they can work faster and better without having to stop to consult manuals. That’s technology that Upskill, a Herndon, Va.-based tech company, already provides to customers like GE and Boeing, which just invested in the company. “This technology can augment the skills of less specialized workers and help expert workers work faster,” Upskill executive chairman Dr. Magid Abraham told Fortune at a GE event last week. But back to the conference: Greene says he was struck about how optimistic most of the speakers were — the roster also included former British Prime Minister David Cameron and New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman. “If I were optimistic, I wouldn’t spend all this time and energy on this conference,” he said. The difference between the industrial revolution of the 19th century and the current situation, he said, is that back then machines replaced physical labor but also created many retail, bookkeeping, machine repair, and accounting jobs related to the goods produced. Now, however, the world is dealing not only with robots that do physical labor but with AI that does mental labor as well. Says Greene: “We can’t compete with both physical machines and thinking machines.” This story originally appeared on Fortune.com.
