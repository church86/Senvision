All passengers and crew escaped from the Boeing Co. 777-300 following the 12:45 p.m. explosion on Flight 521 from Thiruvananthapuram, India. A firefighter was killed trying to extinguish the blaze, Emirates Chairman Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum said at an evening news conference in Dubai. The trouble with the flight was “operational,” he said, adding he didn’t believe there was any security issue. The pilot might have attempted a so-called go-around – that is, aborting the landing – to avoid wind shear, but that hadn’t been verified, Sheikh Ahmed said. The airport had issued a wind-shear warning for all runways before the accident, according to the AviationSafetyNetwork website. The condition occurs when wind direction changes abruptly. In extreme cases, it can be severe enough that a plane will lose lift and plunge. “It’s difficult to speculate about what happened in the last few minutes of the flight, but I want to thank the crew for their professionalism and evacuating the plane in a short time,” Sheikh Ahmed said. The pilot and co-pilot had logged more than 7,000 of flying hours each, he said. Cockpit Instructions Flight 521 had been cleared to land at Dubai, according to a transcript of an air-traffic control recording obtained by LiveATC.net. About a minute and a-half later, the tower gave a new instruction. “Emirates 521 climb straight ahead to 4,000 feet” (1,200 meters), a controller said, a command acknowledged by the pilot. The reason for the order wasn’t known. Typically, such instructions are issued after pilots request to abort touchdowns. Television footage and newswire photos showed that the aircraft slid to a halt on its belly, with one of its huge Rolls-Royce engines detached. The jet then quickly became engulfed in smoke and fire, which gutted the length of the fuselage and burned off the roof. The jumbo jet carried 282 passengers and 18 crew members, according to Emirates, the world’s biggest carrier by international traffic. Emergency services sprayed down the plane to put out the fire. Passengers and crew hurried to safety down inflatable slides. Thirteen people were hospitalized with minor injuries, Sheikh Ahmed said. Dubai airport, the world’s third-busiest by passenger numbers, shut down shortly after the crash and reopened at 6:30 p.m. on a restricted basis, giving priority to arriving flights. Investigation Teams The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board is sending a five-person team to assist with the investigation, a spokesman said. Under a United Nations treaty, the government from where the plane was manufactured is invited to participate in a probe. Despite the reported winds, the pilots should have been able to land the plane — or climb to safety if they were uncomfortable with the situation, said John Cox, president of Safety Operating Systems and a former airline pilot. “Professional pilots deal with high winds and gusty winds on a regular basis,” Cox said in an interview. “It’s like cruise-ship captains. You are going to have to learn to dock that thing when it’s calm or when winds are at 40 knots.” At this point, investigators won’t rule anything out, looking at weather conditions, possible pilot missteps and potential failures of aircraft systems, he said. The aircraft involved entered service in 2003 and was current for regular maintenance and inspections, Sheikh Ahmed. ‘Belly Flop’ John Nance, a former commercial and U.S. Air Force pilot who has flown a 777, said videos from the scene indicate that the landing gear may not have been fully deployed when Flight 521 touched down. “This is a situation where it looks very much like the aircraft was landing with gear up. It does appear this was a belly flop,” he said. “Why is a good question, especially if the aircraft was ordered to go around.” Boeing’s 777 model is the largest twin-engine airliner in production and the most used wide-body. Emirates is the biggest operator of the plane as well as of Airbus Group SE’s A380 double-decker. The Boeing aircraft is also one of the safest, with only a handful suffering irreparable damage since the model’s introduction two decades ago, including incidents caused by war or pilot error, according to Aviation Safety Network. Rolls-Royce Engine Boeing is standing by with a technical team to help U.S. authorities investigating the accident, the U.S. planemaker said on its website. Rolls-Royce Holdings Plc, which made the jet’s Trent 800 engines, also said it was ready to take part in the probe. Wednesday’s 3 1/2-hour flight started midmorning from Thiruvananthapuram on India’s southwest coast. Emirates serves the region mainly to ferry Indian workers to jobs in the Middle East. The carrier has built its business on exploiting the Persian Gulf’s position at the heart of intercontinental flight paths and the region’s oil industry, building Dubai into an airport that served 78 million passengers last year, making the hub the world’s biggest by international traffic. The carrier’s success has put pressure on earnings at European network airlines including Air France-KLM Group and Deutsche Lufthansa AG. Copyright 2016 Bloomberg.

The Boeing 777 disappeared on March 8, 2014, en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing with 239 people onboard. An extensive underwater hunt in the southern Indian Ocean has not yet found the crash site, fueling speculation it may be outside the current search zone, particularly if someone was at the controls at the end of the flight. A manned plane could have been glided down, allowing it to enter the water outside the 120,000 sq.-km area being searched, some experts have suggested. But extensive testing by aircraft manufacturer Boeing and new Australian defense department data analysis both suggest that — regardless of the possible actions of one or both of the pilots — the jet dived into the ocean at high speed, The Australian reported. Once MH370 ran out of fuel and the engines flamed, it slowed before plunging down towards the water in a series of swoops — dropping from 35,000 feet at a rate of between 12,000 feet a minute and 20,000 feet a minute, Boeing said, according to the report. The sharp dive was confirmed by a new data analysis by Australia’s defense department involving signals sent automatically between the plane and a satellite, the head of the agency leading the MH370 hunt said. Australian Transport and Safety Bureau chief Greg Hood said this supported the view MH370 was likely to have crashed in the 120,000 sq.-km area now being searched, the paper said. The area was defined under the ATSB’s “most likely” scenario that no-one was at the controls and the plane ran out of fuel. “The Australians leading the search do not doubt that the pilot may well have been responsible for the jet’s disappearance but they say critics of the search strategy are wrong to assume that means they are looking in the wrong place,” the report added. Malaysian officials said last week that one of the pilots used a home-made flight simulator to plot a very similar course to MH370’s presumed final route, but warned this did not prove he deliberately crashed the plane.

Sydney, Australia:  MH370 plunged into the ocean at high speed -- up to 20,000 feet a minute -- reinforcing analysis that the missing Malaysia Airlines jet crashed in the current search zone, a report said Tuesday. The Boeing 777 disappeared on March 8, 2014 en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing with 239 people onboard. An extensive underwater hunt in the southern Indian Ocean has not yet found the crash site, fuelling speculation it may be outside the current search zone, particularly if someone was at the controls at the end of the flight. A manned plane could have been glided down, allowing it to enter the water outside the 120,000 square kilometre (46,000 square mile) area being searched, some experts have suggested. But extensive testing by aircraft manufacturer Boeing and new Australian defence department data analysis both suggest that -- regardless of the possible actions of one or both of the pilots -- the jet dived into the ocean at high speed, The Australian reported. Once MH370 ran out of fuel and the engines flamed, it slowed before plunging down towards the water in a series of swoops -- dropping from 35,000 feet at a rate of between 12,000 feet a minute and 20,000 feet a minute, Boeing said, according to the report. The sharp dive was confirmed by a new data analysis by Australia's defence department involving signals sent automatically between the plane and a satellite, the head of the agency leading the MH370 hunt said. Australian Transport and Safety Bureau chief Greg Hood said this supported the view MH370 "was likely to have crashed in the 120,000 square kilometre (46,000 square mile) area now being searched," the paper said. The area was defined under the ATSB's "most likely" scenario that no-one was at the controls and the plane ran out of fuel. "The Australians leading the search do not doubt that the pilot may well have been responsible for the jet's disappearance but they say critics of the search strategy are wrong to assume that means they are looking in the wrong place," the report added. Malaysian officials said last week that one of the pilots used a home-made flight simulator to plot a very similar course to MH370's presumed final route, but warned this did not prove he deliberately crashed the plane.

The one-year-old plane had its original engine replaced three months ago, meaning it has gone through two engines within 12 months, according to The Australian.

'We have asked engine manufacturer GE for an explanation. GE has a team which is working with our engineers to understand what occurred.'  RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Census 2016: Everything your household needs to know about...

Share this article Share There have been nine separate in-flight issues with the GEnx engine on the Boeing 787 during the past year, including a Qatar Airways 787 flight travelling from Norway to Qatar that was forced to shut off its engine and divert the plane. A General Electric spokeswoman told Daily Mail Australia that the GEnx-1B engine has 'more than three million hours of operation on more than 250 air planes.' Flight JQ12 was heading from Narita, Japan, to the Gold Coast when it was diverted after the pilot was alerted to possible oil pressure issues in one of the GEnx engines (stock image) 'GE is actively supporting Jetstar to ensure that the Boeing 787 returns to airline service as soon as possible. The engine event is under investigation,' she said.  'GE continually monitors and analyzes the performance of the GEnx fleet in service. Based on the engine fleet’s service history, we are not aware of operational issues that would hazard the continued safe flight of aircraft powered by these engines.' Qantas will receive eight Boeing 787s with GEnx engines in October this year and integrate them into their international fleet, replacing five older Boering 747s. A General Electric spokeswoman said the incident is under investigation but argued that the engine is safe (pictured is a maintenance technician works on a jet engine of a Boeing C-17) Flight JQ12's more than 300 passengers spent 24 hours in Guam before continuing to the Gold Coast on Monday morning on another Jetstar 787 Dreamliner  Flight JQ12's more than 300 passengers spent 24 hours in Guam before continuing to the Gold Coast on Monday morning on another Jetstar 787 Dreamliner.  Some frustrated passengers took to social media to slam the airline for the lack of communication around what alternative travel arrangements were being made. 'Beyond ridiculous, understand safety comes first, but no one is communicating! Never experienced such poor customer service,' one woman wrote on Twitter.

The jumbo jet is officially going extinct -- here's a look at its glory days By Benjamin Zhang of Business Insider | < PREVIOUS SLIDE SLIDE 1 of 53 NEXT SLIDE > Boeing 747 production is slowly coming to an end Boeing might stop producing its iconic 747 aircraft. "If we are unable to obtain sufficient orders and/or market, production and other risks cannot be mitigated, we could record additional losses that may be material, and it is reasonably possible that we could decide to end production of the 747," Boeing said in a regulatory filing. Boeing is currently producing one 747 every month, but said it will cut down starting in September to one every other month. For more than 40 years, the wide-body jumbo jet ruled the skies. But with changes in aviation regulations and airline-business strategy and improvements in turbofan-engine technology, the days of huge aircraft are drawing to a close. Since its introduction in 1969, the Boeing 747 has transformed the way people travel. With its ability to fly 500 passengers 6,000 miles, the jumbo jet allowed airlines to reach new destinations while achieving profitability by lowering the per-seat cost of operation. Over the years, Boeing was joined in the long-haul wide-body market by offerings from McDonnell Douglas, Lockheed, and Airbus. In 2005, Airbus introduced the double-deck A380-800 — perhaps the most capable rival the Boeing jumbo jet had ever encountered. But these days, Boeing and Airbus are having a hard time finding new buyers for both aircraft. The cost of purchasing such a large craft, combined with the fact that they're relatively energy inefficient, makes them impractical. Demand for the big jets has also dwindled as aviation regulations changed, airlines moved away from the hub-and-spoke model for their routes, and jet-engine technology improved — making it safer for aircraft to fly long distances with just two engines. Sadly, even the 747's freighter business is struggling. Airbus hasn't won an airline order for the double-decker jet since it sold Emirates a batch two years ago. Although there are rumors that Japan's ANA is looking to buy, don't expect many others to join in. James Hogan, chief executive of Emirates' rival, Etihad, was unequivocal when asked by Business Insider if the group will buy another four-engine jet. "No, we're done," Hogan said. "We just believe in two-engine technology — they are much more efficient." And Virgin Atlantic CEO Craig Kreeger told Business Insider that he was surprised Airbus was able to find as many takers for the A380 as they have. Long-distance and transoceanic flights were traditionally exclusively covered by the 747 and its fellow three- or four-engine, wide-body jumbos because, when it comes to the engine count on an airliner, the thinking was that there is safety in numbers. But as modern turbofan engines became more reliable, and engine failures far less common, the thinking and the regulations changed. As a result, most airlines have turned to twin-engine mini jumbos that are more fuel-efficient. Further, airlines are moving away from the hub-and-spoke business model that calls for massive numbers of passengers to be routed through a single mega hub. Smaller, fuel-efficient jets, such as the Boeing 787 Dreamliner, allow airlines to offer passengers nonstop, point-to-point service without transiting through a hub.

Reuters/Robert Sorbo The aviation industry would be more competitive which is why a German bank foresees lower full-year profit for Australian flag carrier Qantas. However, the flying roo is expecting a new jet in 2017 which could open new routes for the company and make it soar above rivals. The Telegraph reports that Qantas is scheduled to receive its first Boeing 787 in 2017. It opens the possibility for the air carrier to announce new routes by late 2016, including a likely direct flights between London and Perth. If Qantas gets regulatory approval for the long-haul route, it would compete with the world’s longest commercial flight, Emirates’ Dubai-Auckland route, covering 8,819 miles and 17 hours and 15 minutes to fly. Qantas’s longest long-haul flight is the Dallas-Sydney leg which covers 8,578 miles. In preparation for the arrival of a new Dreamliner, Qantas purchased a $23-million Boeing 787-9 simulator installed at the company’s Mascot headquarters, supplementing an existing simulator at the Jetstar facility in Melbourne. By having a simulator, Qantas would have the ability to replace older and less efficient jets and deliver potential new routes, says Alan Joyce, Qantas Group CEO. The air carrier’s flight training centre runs 24/7, overseen by a team of trainers and check captains to ensure Qantas pilots are among the best in the world, Joyce says, reports Tenplay. The B787 simulator would certify a new generation of Qantas aviators to fly the next-generation plane. As Qantas moves toward the newer aircraft, it cancelled its eight orders for A380 with Airbus. Although the A380 is well-liked by air travelers, airline demand for the four-engine jet failed to meet expectations. Instead, many airlines shift to the smaller but more fuel-efficient twin-engine planes like the 787 amid changing oil prices.

Sort Notes Newest First Oldest First Show 46 Newer Notes James Fallows 5:25 PM / August 8, 2016 Challenging the Premise of the 'Trump Time Capsule' Another unprecedented president? The Battle of New Orleans, Edward Percy Moran / Library of Congress In the 70-plus installments collected here, I’ve been recording (some of) the ways Donald Trump differs from people who have previously come so close to the presidency. Here are two readers who disagree with the premise of the series, from a long-term-historical perspective and a more recent one. I’ll quote them each and then explain where I agree, and don’t. First, from an American overseas: I am a U.S. citizen currently living in Seoul. While I do not support Trump, and although I will vote Democrat come this election, I do not believe Trump is as unprecedented as some of the other readers seem to believe. In this case, I am writing to you with specific reference to the President Obama’s remarks against Trump’s temperament, and Trump’s talk of a rigged game. Both have clear analogues to the 1824 electoral cycle. Andrew Jackson, as I am sure you know, horrified the Democratic-Republican elite. He paved the way for Common Man candidates by slowly expanding suffrage and embracing the Jeffersonian ideal of a Yeoman America. Thomas Jefferson, a former president at the time, had this to say about the prospect of a Jacksonian presidency: I feel much alarm at the prospect of seeing General Jackson President. He is one of the most unfit men I know for such a place. He has had very little respect for laws and constitutions, and is, in fact, an able military chief. His passions are terrible. When I was President of the Senate, he was Senator, and he could never speak on account of the rashness of his feelings, and as often choke with rage. Truly, Jefferson was not the active president, but I think that a quibbling detail. He was the author of the constitution and the founder of the ruling party. I support our president, but Obama’s prestige now could not contend with Jefferson’s then. But notice the same critique: Like Trump, Jackson was seen as unfit for his temperament, not his ideas. His passions were so intense as to disqualify him from office. And of course, like Trump, Jackson saw power in conspiratorial terms. His Bank Veto still reads like an Industrial Workers of the World manifesto. And, as I’m sure you know, in 1824 Jackson saw his electoral loss as a conspiracy, a Corrupt Bargain where Clay and Adams stole the White House from him. Jackson, by fundamentally undermining the electoral process and the legitimacy of the new president, was tapping into the zeitgeist and leading it towards victory four years later. Trump is doing the same. Jackson is not my favorite president, and I suspect a President Trump would wreck synonymous havoc on minorities and the American economy. But America survived Jackson, who was an obvious danger to our democracy. We will survive Trump, although he may change us—or kill us all in nuclear fire. On this comparison, I’m happy to stipulate that so much is so dramatically different between the America of the 1820s and the America of 2016 as to bring any “unprecedented” judgment into question. (For instance: back then there was no electricity or real-time communication; there still was slavery; only certain white men could vote; etc.) So I’ll more frequently say “unprecedented in modern times.” But while recognizing that historians talk about the revolution of Jackson’s arrival, and that temperamentally Jackson may be closer to Trump than any other real-world president, the differences between them as plausible national leaders are still immense. By the time he was elected president in 1828, Jackson had: been elected to the House once; been elected to the Senate twice; served as military governor of Florida; and won more popular and electoral votes for the presidency than any other candidate in 1824, only to lose to John Quincy Adams when the House of Representatives decided the outcome. All this is apart from his experience as battlefield commander. If Donald Trump had had any elective-office experience whatsoever (for instance: Green Party candidate Jill Stein was elected a Town Meeting Seat in Lexington, Mass.), or had ever held any public or military office of any kind, it would be easier to suggest some likeness. After the jump, the more contemporary dissent from a reader: *** Continue Reading Judy Myers explains why she is growing uncomfortable with the Time Capsule approach: I share your fear of what is happening in our society that would allow Trump to become the elected candidate of a major party. I hope the Time Capsule accomplishes your intended goal. As you may have expected, there is a “but.” It is your tone of amazement that these things are happening, and what I see as your over-reach in describing some of them as horrifying in their uniqueness. Take your Capsule number 69. Why did Mr. Rucker conduct his interview with a television facing the interviewee? Why did you not list the Trump interview with Bob Woodward, which I think was the best Trump has done?  (It seemed to me that Woodward was trying to have a discussion with Trump, not sandbag him.) I accept that your intent is to document the Trump campaign, but it would be just as easy to do to Hillary Clinton what you are doing to Trump. Mrs. Clinton has important weaknesses, and it would be just as easy to characterize her in the way that you characterize Mr. Trump. To take just one example, she is having just as impossible a time explaining her email problem as he is having in addressing what we see as his defects. I live surrounded by Trump supporters. Many are giving up on Democratic leadership as being ineffective in supporting regular people trying to live a regular life. Some of these people see President Obama’s election as a cataclysmic event that destroyed their belief that other Americans shared their view. (Many others have written about this, so I won’t.) I suggest that it is not just Trump; that you are claiming objectivity but your bias is showing. I suggest that Bush 43 was seriously unprepared for the presidency. I suggest that his attention span and depth of knowledge and understanding of presidential issues was not that different from Trump. I suggest that Clinton is just as resistant to outside information as Trump, and in fact most people who reach such heights of power are similarly resistant. I suggest that Trump has raised important issues to the point that we are talking about them—letting business and power take so much is hurting workers. Comparing him to Clinton, his opposition to the TPP as it was constructed when it became a campaign issue, I want to oppose parts of it too. Yes, he is a self-involved blowhard. No, I don’t want his hand of the nation’s tiller. In closing, I ask you to read this, “The Media’s Foolish Moralizing About Donald Trump,” by Damon Linker. Whatever else is happening, we as a country have an opportunity for conversation now that some of our rifts are being openly discussed. Let's not blow it. To that end, I would like to see your writeup of what you heard in Texas and Kansas. I am down closer to the coast and to Mexico and the area you visited is very different from where I am. I am looking forward to your report on what you saw. I appreciate Ms. Myers’s careful attention, and her taking the time to write in. Here is where and how I see the world differently from her: It might be worth emphasizing again the journalistic idea behind starting this Time Capsule series. Donald Trump’s rise is clearly an unusual moment in our public history. No one like him has gotten this close to the presidency in modern times—by which I mean, no one with his total lack of elective or public-office experience, no one as willing to dismiss norms of what nominees “can” and “cannot” say. My purpose, as set out from the start, is to lay down a real time record of what it was like as the country decided whether to make him its leader—and in particular, the ways in which he did depart from norms.                                                                                 As I’ve explicitly said, I’m not imagining that I’m going to change a single voter’s mind. I personally think that Trump’s candidacy has been bad for our civic fiber—“the judge is a Mexican!”—and that a Trump presidency would be worse. But it’s a free country; people can choose as they want. I’m trying to document we know while making that choice.                                                                                                 On a detailed point, I haven’t asked Philip Rucker, but I’ll bet you anything it was not his choice to have Trump looking back and forth at the TV while Rucker was trying to interview him. (One reason I say so: common sense. Another reason: in the transcript, Rucker keeps trying to draw Trump away from what Trump has glimpsed on TV.) And the reason why than transcript seemed significant is that, like the great majority of other long interviews by Trump, it was notable for its lack of sentence-by-sentence sustained argument or thought. It was also significant, as I mentioned, because it displayed Trump’s hair-trigger reaction to a plane crash he had seen, with an immediate, confident explanation that was probably wrong. This would be a very dangerous trait in an actual president.                                                                                                 We move now to the realm of the subjective: I have spent a depressingly large share of my life paying close attention to the way public figures talk—when they are being interviewed, when they are extemporizing on the stump, when they’re battling opponents in debates, when they’re delivering formal speeches. There’s an enormous range among them: Bill Clinton would sound mesmerizing in a rally speech, but if you read the transcript, it would just look ordinary. Teddy Kennedy was a magnificent formal orator but could seem tongue-tied or even aphasic in some interviews. Ronald Reagan was amazingly consistent in his tone, discourse, and argumentative structure whether giving a speech or being interviewed. Bob Dole was notably different in his private wise-cracking mode and his stiffer formal presentations. They’re all individuals, and they’re all different. But in my experience, Trump is different from any of the rest of them. He knows less—about the government, about the world, about anything other than himself. Rick Perry got in trouble for a botched debate answer, but he could talk very well about his plans for Texas. Similarly for Dan Quayle, but I once interviewed him about American defense policy in the Pacific, and he was very erudite. I have never met Trump in person. But the transcripts of his interviews seem to belong in one category, and other public figures I’ve known (with their huge variation) in the other. I’m suggesting that he is different from other public figures, because in my judgment he is.                                                                                                 By extension, I also disagree with the idea that you could apply just the same treatment to George W. Bush or Hillary Clinton. I didn’t vote for Bush, and I think his administration was one of the most destructive in our history. The Iraq war; torture and Guantanamo; the conditions leading to the great crash of 2008, these will always be part of his legacy. But I never doubted that he was a serious man, who took the office (that his father had also held) extremely seriously, and who was doing his best (in ways I disagreed with), and who recognized the gravity of the choices he would make. It was Bush who went to national mosque six days after the 9/11 attacks. It is impossible to imagine him responding to the Khan family the way Donald Trump did. As for Hillary Clinton, she is not a very good campaigner, as the world knows. It was foolish of her to set up her own server to begin with, and no one can understand why she doesn’t just say: This was a huge mistake, I’m sorry, let me answer any question about it for the next six hours, and then we’re done. But the idea that she is “just as resistant to outside information as Trump, and in fact most people who reach such heights of power are similarly resistant” is, in my judgment, just categorically wrong. The problem of getting honest judgments, bad news and all, once you become powerful is indeed a profound one. Every leader has grappled with it; it’s a theme of the origins of the Vietnam and Iraq wars, of political treatises from Machiavelli onward. But I am absolutely sure that Hillary Clinton would at least theoretically recognize it as a problem. I have seen no signal that Trump is aware of this peril at all. That’s enough for now. Thanks for reading, and for writing in. James Fallows 7:43 PM / August 4, 2016 Update from Philip Rucker on Trump as Aerospace Guy Previous items today concerned Donald Trump’s reaction to an airplane crash that was noted briefly on Fox News, while he was in the middle of a major newspaper interview. Trump said he’d “never liked that plane, structurally,” but the question is which plane he considered flawed. Had he just seen news about the crash-landing of a Boeing 777 in Dubai? Or about a Navy F-18 in Nevada? Or a twin-engine Piper Seneca in Arizona? I asked Philip Rucker, who was conducting the great WaPo interview with Trump, whether he noticed or remembered what Trump had seen. His reply: I wish I had a definitive answer for you, but unfortunately I do not. Unlike Donald Trump, I was seated with my back to the TV, so I wasn't paying much attention to what was on the screen. The TV was tuned to Fox News. I recall it was a small plane crash and not the Emirates 777. It might have been the Sedona crash….  I do not believe it was a military plane, but I cannot say for certain. The crash was only briefly on the newscast. Much of the time during our interview Fox was covering Trump. So odds favor the Sedona crash of the Piper Seneca—in circumstances (night flight, mountainous terrain, older pilot flying on his own) that likely have nothing whatsoever to do with aircraft-structural concerns. *** Meaning-of-Trump point: the way his mind works. Immediately after an Egyptair flight disappeared over the Mediterranean in June, Trump declared, What just happened? A plane got blown out of the sky. And if anybody thinks it wasn’t blown out of the sky, you’re 100% wrong, folks, OK? You’re 100% wrong. No one knows for sure now, and no one had any idea then, what had happened to that Egyptair plane. Yet Trump moved instantly to “you’re 100% wrong!” mode. Again this week, in his instant reaction to whatever crash he saw, Trump responded instantly (and probably incorrectly). And he was in a position to make this misjudgment because he was so interested in seeing news that was mainly about himself. I know, there’s hardly any news value in pointing this out any more, but: the man doesn’t know very much, isn’t aware of what he doesn’t know, thinks poorly, yet is super-decisive. Ryan, McConnell, Rubio, Cotton, et al: Heck of a job! James Fallows 5:44 PM / August 4, 2016 Donald Trump, Aerospace Engineer Maybe this is the plane Donald Trump "never liked, structurally"? LCPL JOHN MCGARITY, USMC via Department of Defense In an item earlier today I quoted a Boeing engineer who was dumbfounded / amused by Donald Trump’s off-hand comment that he “never liked that plane, structurally” about the mighty Boeing 777. Several people have written in to say that maybe we’re not giving Trump full credit. Perhaps news of some other airplane crash might have been on the screen when it caught his eye and occasioned this remark. (Sample letter after the jump.) The possibilities include: A Navy F-18 that crashed on a training flight in Nevada not long before Trump’s interview. Fortunately the pilot parachuted to safety. A twin-engine Piper Seneca aircraft that crashed near Sedona, Arizona, on a nighttime flight around the same time. Unfortunately the 76-year-old pilot, the only person aboard, was killed. The Emirates 777 that crash-landed in Dubai, fortunately with relatively few casualties. This is the one the Boeing staff assumed Trump was talking about. So we’re left with these choices: - Trump was questioning the structural fitness of one of Boeing’s best-selling and (on the evidence) structurally soundest models. After the 777’s introduction in the mid-1990s, its first fatal episode was the pilot-error Asiana crash into a runway at SFO three years ago; or - Trump was saying he “never liked that plane, structurally” about the Navy’s workhorse F-18, which first flew back in the 1970s and which has had critics of its cost, complexity, and design, but not on grounds that people “never liked it, structurally”; or - He was reacting to a light-airplane crash at nighttime, in mountainous terrain, with an older pilot who was flying by himself—that is, in circumstances where “structural” problems of the airplane virtually never turn out to be relevant. Or, something else. Just adding this to round out the explanation. I have written to Philip Rucker, of the Post, to ask if he noticed what was on TV to see which crash Trump would have been talking about. Continue Reading *** Note from a reader on the which-crash-was-it mystery: The Trump interview was conducted on August 2, according to the editor's note, and the Dubai crash was early in the morning of August 3 EST. I think the crash was probably the Flagstaff one August 2 involving a Piper Seneca -- which perhaps makes his engineering criticism more defensible than if it was a 777, but frankly makes his distraction even more extraordinary. One person died in that crash, sadly, but it wasn't a huge news event like the Dubai incident. And from another reader: If he gets elected (shudder), I'm sure we'll see Divine Leader Kim Il Trump visiting Renton or Everett to "give guidance" to Boeing workers. And from another staffer at Boeing: Word is he’ll be visiting WA to raise money at the end of the month. Hopefully I’ll have a chance to ask him for advice on ways to use topology optimization to improve the design of 3D printed structures. James Fallows 1:15 PM / August 4, 2016 Cows! Squirrels! Airplanes! The Many Thoughts of Donald Trump A Boeing 777-300, flown by Emirates. Want to know what's good and bad about this airplane? Of course there is only one expert to consult. Paul Spijkers via Wikimedia Last night I mentioned the resemblance between Donald Trump’s frequently distractable discourse—I don’t like mosquitos! Back to Mike Pence!—and Danny DeVito’s famous “Cows!” scene in Throw Momma From the Train. As a public service, I offer a glimpse of Cows once more: Many readers have written in to say that the closer comparison might be Dug the Dog, with his “Squirrel!” scene from the great movie Up. You be the judge: *** During one of Trump’s Cows! / Squirrel!  interludes in his interview with the Washington Post, he offered the following observations about plane-crash news that was flickering across the screen: [Trump looks at a nearby television, which was tuned to Fox News.] Oh, did they have another one of these things go down? It’s terrible that crash. Never liked that plane, structurally. I never thought that plane could— The dash-mark at the end is when the interviewer, Philip Rucker, tries to bring Trump back to the topic at hand.   A reader in the Northwest took particular note of Trump’s comments: I’m a stress analyst at Boeing and I just wanted to let you know that we’ve been chuckling at Trump’s latest quote from his interview with Philip Rucker: “Never liked that plane, structurally...” I assume he was referring to the Emirates 777-300 that crashed in Dubai. I’m with many of my co-workers in hoping that a reporter asks a follow-up question on what, precisely, Mr. Trump dislikes about the structural design of the 777.  I’m sure his answer would delight and entertain! Or, more surprisingly, he might be well versed in shear flow theory. Who knows!? The reader’s email had the subject line “Donald Trump—Structural Engineer.” Other possibilities would include: “Donald Trump—New Frontiers in Bullshit” or “Donald Trump—It’s Even Worse Than You Think.” But on reflection, I like plain old “Donald Trump—Structural Engineer” for its understated charm. What Donald Trump doesn’t know about an airplane matches what he doesn’t know about everything else.   James Fallows 1:10 PM / August 2, 2016 'A Fundamental Decency': The Difference Between Rob Ford and Donald Trump A sign two years ago for then-mayor of Toronto, Rob Ford, whose style many have likened to Donald Trump’s. Ford died of cancer early this year; a reader explains an important contrast with Trump. (Mark Blinch / Reuters) Many people have noted the campaign-style similarities between Donald Trump and Rob Ford, the late mayor of Toronto. John Spragge, who lives in Toronto, says that the Capt. Khan episode points out an important difference: I am the Canadian systems analyst who sometimes writes you from Toronto. Earlier in this campaign, I compared Donald Trump to the late Toronto mayor Rob Ford. I still believe Mr. Ford drew much of his support from people who feel alienated and left out, and I believe getting elected mayor had dire personal consequences for Mr. Ford, just as I believe attaining the presidency might have serious consequences for Mr. Trump. However, over the past week I have come to see important distinctions between Mr. Ford and Mr. Trump; I think Mr. Ford’s greater skill at retail politics speaks to a fundamental decency. As I put it in a web log post [JF emphasis added]: When I asked myself how Rob Ford would have responded to Khizr Khan’s speech, it occurred to me: Rob Ford would have called the Khans. He would have talked to them. Rob always called people who disagreed with him. He would have listened the he Khans. He would have expressed sympathy with their sacrifice. He would probably not have changed any of his positions, but he would have given the Khans the courtesy of a hearing. All Rob Ford’s most vehement opponents, which some times included me, acknowledged his ability as a retail politician. He listened to people, and whether he agreed with us or not he gave the impression he cared what we thought. I think he genuinely did; I think he had a real desire to help and connect with people, and unlike Donald Trump, he did not respond to opposition with the fury of wounded vanity. Rob Ford was diagnosed with cancer during the last election and has since died. Since the emergence of Mr. Trump, many Toronto residents have seen the parallels between the social forces that gave rise to his candidacy and Mr. Trump’s. I think we owe it to his memory to acknowledge that nothing in his record suggests he would have treated the Khans the way Trump did. *** Thanks to the very large number of people who have written in with responses to yesterday’s item, about why Republican “leaders” are standing with Donald Trump and for how long they’ll do so. An assortment of those is coming up when I can get to it, along with the next sixteen zillion Time Capsule entries. James Fallows 7:37 PM / August 1, 2016 Supporting Trump: The GOP's Equivalent of the Iraq War Vote Jonathan Erns / Reuters In the Time Capsule thread (now up to #66), I’ve been chronicling some of the ongoing words, deeds, and gestures that the Republican party has decided to swallow from its nominee. This parallel “Trump Nation” thread is mainly for reader reaction to the spectacle of 2016, and in particular what the “responsible” GOP is showing about itself. Trump himself is beyond criticism or judgment. What we see is who he is. But I think that people looking back at our time will be much harsher in their judgment of the Republican “leaders” who are trying to have it both ways. The Speaker of the House, the Majority Leader of the Senate, senators like Tom Cotton and Marco Rubio, governors like Chris Christie and the now-trapped Mike Pence, figures from the past like Rudy Giuliani — every one of these people knows what is wrong with Donald Trump, and every one of them will be telling us as of November 9 that they were never really with him, they always saw what was wrong, how did this ever happen? But for now, every one one of them is saying, Vote for Trump! You can understand, sort of, their constraint. If they come out and say, Vote for Hillary Clinton, in the short run they might infuriate substantial portions of their own electoral base. And if the longer run, if she does win, then every “liberal” thing she does, starting with her Supreme Court appointments, can be thrown back at them. Oh, there’s your President Clinton with her Bolshevik on the Court. Happy now? Oh, there’s your President Clinton, with …   You can understand it. But to say it’s “understandable” is not to say that it’s right, or even smart. I think they’re making a mistake not just from some lofty historical perspective but in how they will look in the relatively near future. Barack Obama won the Democratic nomination eight years ago, and the vastly better known Hillary Clinton did not, because she had joined most senior members of her party (including Joe Biden and John Kerry) in being wrong in a hugely consequential choice, the Iraq war, and Obama had been right. A reader says you can extend that analysis to the choice of backing Trump: As I’ve watched the way that Trump has been able to overcome unforced error after unforced error that should, and used to, effectively mean the end of a viable campaign, I’m interested in the box that this puts the GOP elite.  Most seem to be trying to thread the needle in the Paul Ryan mode—I support the nominee, but I speak out not too forcefully on the most egregious statements.   What we may be seeing is the real-time development of another Bush Iraq War moment. In this scenario, it will seem obvious to anyone after an easy win by Clinton that they should have publicly called out Trump and said they were bound by conscience not to support him. This raises an interesting question.  In this scenario, who takes the role of Obama, who got used his anti-war position to jump start his road to the White House?  It was a huge risk for a little known Senator, but the payoff was huuuuuuuge! Right now you can probably rule out the Bushes or Romney or just about every elected GOP bigwig. Does it just leave Kasich? Or, with all his complications, Cruz. *** Continue Reading A reader in the Midwest makes a related point: I have followed with great interest the chronicling of the Trump campaign for the historical record. My question to you is this: Is there any integrity left in the Republican party? I have waited for months for one prominent Republican with real “skin in the game” to step up and say something and take a stand. Something along this line: “You know that I am a Republican, but I am an American first. And as an American, I cannot and will not support the nominee of our party. He is not qualified to be President of this country. If this costs me my position, so be it. Some things are more important!” Is it too much to ask for just one person to have the balls to do this? And if it is too much, what does this say about our country? *** A reader who has worked in Republican politics defends John McCain, who has condemned Trump’s statements but so far not Trump himself: My own opinion is doing anything you can to defeat Trump and hold his enablers accountable is one’s a moral imperative as an American, an acid test of one’s character.   That said you know that life is a balancing act and McCain is trying to win a GOP primary is a state with a hard-right GOP electorate. Have to give him a little latitude.  Also suspect that’s why he included this line, “...which I will have to answer at the Final Judgment...”— he knows it’s an acid test he's failing and will have to answer for, and it’s weighing on him.   This reader goes on to say that the Republicans who should be judged most harshly are those who are not up for re-election themselves this year (unlike McCain) but are still riding the Trump Train. *** From a lawyer on the West Coast: I thought your term “Vichy Republican” was quite apt. I say this because I was recently watching the Ophuls documentary about France under the Nazi Occupation The Sorrow and the Pity. It does a masterful job of drawing out people on why they decided to resist or collaborate. One thing that strikes me how many conservatives in 1940 France felt that “well, better Hitler than Blum.” Leon Blum being France’s first Jewish prime minister, who served at the head of a left-wing government in the period 1936-1938.  It just sounds a lot like the praise many conservatives of like Trump and Farange have for Putin and disdain for Obama … *** A brief note on a potential silver lining: Wouldn’t it be great if the Khans, Muslim-Americans, became the moral conscience of the nation during this election, with their dignity and eloquence and compassion? *** And, finally for now, a much longer and more downbeat assessment: It is becoming blatantly clear to me that the GOP is failing in one of its principal roles as a major political party: To filter out those elements which, at their root, would destroy those organic mechanisms which keep our democracy functioning. Given how blatant and ever-increasingly obvious is the nature of Trump, why is it so hard for the country to realize what he represents?  Why did not our national immune system immediately recognize him for who/what he is and spit him out? The answer is that Ryan and McConnell and the Vichy Republicans, are validating Trump’s legitimacy, and have reneged on their fundamental duty leading a major political party. And the GOP’s decay in performing this duty has been advancing for the last 20 years. In today’s NY Times, Lindsay Graham was quoted as saying in reference to Trump’s comments about the Khans, “This is going to a place where we’ve never gone before, to push back against the families of the fallen. There used to be some things that were sacred in American politics — that you don’t do — like criticizing the parents of a fallen soldier, even if they criticize you,” Graham said. At last! A Republican willing to say “YOU JUST CAN'T SAY SUCH THINGS!!”  And here's the thing:  It might have started sooner, perhaps Nixon, perhaps Goldwater; but in my mind it started with Newt Gingrich and the ‘94 Republicans who took power and dismantled the structural protections in Congress which fostered comity and collegiality among adversaries. Since that time, establishment Republicans started saying and doing things that political norms dictated that YOU JUST DON’T DO!   Before that time, no matter how awful the opponent’s policies, the opponent was, nevertheless, a worthy adversary, chosen by worthy citizens who, despite your fervent disagreement with them, were your countrymen.  And starting in ‘94, establishment Republicans started disrespecting the elected representatives of the opposing party. And at that point, they moved from governing to open warfare. And each new incremental move into previously forbidden territory brought new standards of indecency and disrespect; to the point where the honor and patriotism of a proven, decorated war hero (John Kerry), the citizenship and faith of an elected president (Obama), the honor and patriotism of a former POW (McCain), and the fundamental integrity and worth of Congressional institutions (filibuster etc.), were all barriers which it is now acceptable to disregard. Things you just didn’t do, they did. In a quick Google session I was unable to determine who first said it, but I’ve heard it attributed to Jung, that civilization is a thin veneer. We take for granted that the glue holding this democracy together is only as strong as the willingness of the participants to honor the glue. It’s remarkable how few people it would take to disregard the white lane markings of our highways and turn traffic into a snarl. We function because of our consensus that there are just some things that YOU DO NOT SAY, and there are just some things that YOU DO NOT DO. And since 1994, at least, the GOP, with very little assistance from the Democrats, has been saying and doing non-normative things; and this has empowered a large number of people to say and do non-normative things as a result. The country depends on its political parties to scrub out the infectious elements; to make sure that, whatever candidates are put forward, at the root they will put the institutions and the norms that provide the glue for our democracy ahead of their ideological and power questing goals. I wonder how graciously GW Bush/Cheney would have responded to the Supreme Court’s ruling in 2000 had it gone the other way. And in the subsequent Congress, I wonder how graciously the Republicans would have allowed a President Gore to function had the result gone the other way. I wonder how normative the Republican response would have been had 9/11 happened on the watch of a Democratic president. Oh. Wait. BENGHAZI!!!!! The GOP no longer puts the country, its institutions and its norms, ahead of party. And McConnell and Ryan and the Vichy Republicans are glaring truth of the long road down which they've come. Thank you, and Mr. and Mrs. Khan, for directly calling them out. We need the GOP.  We need a functioning, filtering, democracy glue-enhancing GOP. We haven’t had one since it started decaying during the first Clinton administration. And what will happen when, the next time they nominate a candidate, they manage to hide the things that makes Trump so obvious? THAT’s what scares me most ... James Fallows 4:00 PM / July 27, 2016 Why Trump Really Doesn't Want to Release Those Returns A reader who is a veteran lawyer on the West Coast writes about Donald Trump’s argument that he can’t/won’t release his tax returns while they’re under audit by the IRS. (A reason that the IRS itself dismisses.) The reader suggests that in this case, at least, Trump may have thought many moves in advance: 1. I agree with what you are saying about Trump’s tax returns. Of course I also agree with the IRS (i.e., he is free to release them; the audit is irrelevant to that question). 2. But there is ONE way in which the audit is relevant to the release, and vice versa: If Trump releases returns while they are still auditable or being audited—which, of course, every other candidate has done in the past—then the nation’s tax professionals, seeing them and poring over them, are likely if not certain to make public suggestions about things the IRS should look into, or how the IRS should look into them, that might actually lead the IRS to take a look at, or do, something the IRS might not otherwise have done. 3. The nation’s tax professionals might even detect tax fraud that the IRS might miss. That’s a criminal matter—not a back taxes or penalty matter. Which of us would be surprised if they did, in Trump’s case?  (Remember the IRS caught Nixon on tax matters while he was still president; it didn’t help his situation.) 4. Not to mention that if the tax professionals make their suggestions to the IRS privately, then there is the possibility of their earning an actual reward if as a result the IRS is alerted to something that leads to the IRS collecting more tax from Trump than the IRS would otherwise have done. 5. My own suspicion is that the ranks of the nation’s tax professionals probably contain individuals, hostile to Trump or to tax cheats, who ARE aware of tricks the IRS has not yet suspected or at least fully caught up with (there are always new tricks) among taxpayers with really complex returns. 6. At a minimum, the IRS would have a greatly expanded army of volunteer auditors in Trump’s case! Of course, these are all problems that Trump should have thought of before he became a candidate. Perhaps he did, hence the unequivocal nature of his stonewalling. And if Russia really wanted to prove that they are not partial to Trump, and if his returns were filed by his team or are kept by the IRS in electronic form, then the Russians could release his returns for him.  Somehow I doubt that will happen. *** Update another reader writes: I think you and all other reporters have missed one essential point regarding Mr. Trump's tax returns. That is, even if there was some justification for withholding returns under audit, that does not explain the refusal to provide returns for older years. My understanding is that years before 2009 are not under audit, and it might be very helpful if someone would point this out or ask Mr. Trump to produce those returns. He won't, but at least it might help show than his stated reason is bogus. Possibly some journalist has done this but I have not seen it. James Fallows 4:55 PM / July 25, 2016 A Bernie Voter, From Ukraine, on the Putin Story Gleb Garanich / Reuters I think this is very interesting: a reader who knows Russia and Ukraine, on how he reads the unfolding “Putin angle” news. I’m a Ukrainian Jewish immigrant, now a naturalized citizen of the United States. I also was a Bernie Sanders voter in the primary, who will be voting for Hillary Clinton in the general election. This is probably the weirdest year of my life politically. On the right, the anti-immigrant and antisemitic fervor is really a choice cut of hate. The apparent mutual interest of Russia and the Trump campaign has meant that on both the right and left, there is legitimate critique. However, it has also meant there’s a home for a very familiar panic about Eastern Europe and, honestly, people using the critique as cover for rank bigotry who were interested in that bigotry long before Trump and Russia were even a story. Lastly, the DNC e-mails specifically regarding Sanders’ religious views and raising it as an issue with voters WITHIN the Democratic electorate, was a dispiriting reminder that despite what has been a pretty nice life, given enough opportunity bigotry can have a house anywhere, even among friends. However, I’m writing today to provide context for Russia’s actions, from my own experience. When Russia invaded Ukraine, they did it while putting their arms up and saying it wasn’t them, even as it was clear to everyone that it was. There were the anecdotes, of course, about the Russian military insignia of the people coming into Crimea and Eastern Ukraine being torn from their uniforms. Regardless of the truth of those anecdotes—of basically Russians barely modifying their own uniforms, doing the least amount of work to seem not like the Russian army—they got at what is a reality: the transparent cynicism of Russia, the tendency to do the terrible thing and tell the whole world they’re not doing it until they’re years deep into a conflict they can’t escape. I wanted to mention that because in the recent stories, there’s been this emerging picture of Russia as a legitimate threat to the United States, run by a chessmaster. Russia is not a legitimate threat, and Putin is not a chessmaster. Russia is a transparently desperate country. The sanctions and financial freezes have spread Russia thin. They’ve impacted the oligarchs that run the country. They’ve impacted its long-term capacity to use war as an economic plan and perpetually hold sovereign states as territories on a whim. They’ve reduced its capacity to control its client states. The well is running dry. And what they’re doing is the same thing they did in Ukraine. The world was getting away from them, they had something they could not control or overwhelm, so they went in to Crimea and Eastern Ukraine and tried to take it through brute force—all the while putting their hands up in the air and denying they had anything to do with it. Even now, in Putin’s speeches, it is clear he is coming not from a position of strength, but one of great weakness, asking essentially for a mercy that he does not currently deserve, seeing things like the banning on the basis of doping as signs of additional punishment. ‘Russia is not a legitimate threat, and Putin is not a chessmaster. Russia is a transparently desperate country. The sanctions and financial freezes have spread Russia thin. The well is running dry.’ So Russia may be behind the DNC hack. We may be seeing this fight because they’re desperate to elect the man they resemble the most, because it’s the only way out of it they see for themselves. It’s not prowess or intelligence though; it’s desperation and lashing out. Putin took the spirit of the Russian people and defaced it for years, replacing it with militarism and the use of the church as a prop for the state. This was sustained by capital, by investment. And it just isn’t there any more. Robbing the people of their spirit, the rulers of the country now have lost the capacity to fund the things that occupied the void. Their enterprises in Ukraine and Syria look more like past recipes in Chechnya, Georgia and elsewhere for forever war. It’s only a matter of time before the client states, the installed rulers, are once again challenged but do not find the support they once had. It is just history cycling. But to be clear, Russia is not a danger to us so much as it is a danger to itself. A smarter government would have figured out a way other than the invasion of Ukraine, other than perpetually hostile acts such as this hack. A smarter government would not be in a position where it basically has to cut all its own domestic programs to fund wars that will go on forever. A more gifted politician wouldn’t be in a position of accumulating strikes against themselves while demanding mercy. I think this is already the view President Obama holds, as documented in his statements on Russia with Jeffrey Goldberg. ‘Russia's latest transparent ploy, even as its consequences are currently being felt deeply, will eventually be seen for the desperate and unsophisticated acts they are.’ I think this election was and remains a choice between being governed by fear and being governed by perspective, between seeing monsters all over and understanding where we all really are respective to one another. Russia’s latest transparent ploy, even as its consequences are currently being felt deeply, will eventually be seen for the desperate and unsophisticated acts they are. Donald Trump’s series of transparent ploys, his perpetual financial and moral bankruptcy, will be seen the same way, the desperate, angry flicker of a flailing movement unable to navigate a changing world. And we will live this coming January in the same country as this past January—a fractured place working to rebuild itself, to be better than its past, and hopefully a little smarter. I believe this to be true of the United States. I hope one day it will be true for the Ukraine; that it will escape not just the specter of this war, but its older history of corruption as a necessary fact of life. And I hope in time it will be true for Russia itself, either through the reform of its current leaders or through their eventual displacement by those who want something more for their people than desolation and war. It was possible for Iran. These realities do change with the work of people who do not give up their hope even when it seems no one in power has much time for it. I will be casting my vote this November for perspective, up and down the ballot, rather than for a Republican Party and a nominee that can only see a wolf at every door who wants to convince you that his own barking is coming from the outside. I will be describing, at the onset of whatever panic, this same world to my friends that occupy it with me, where our understanding is the antidote to our fear, where the strength of our country is in our knowledge of it. James Fallows 9:27 AM / July 25, 2016 Selling Fear and Anger: The Why and How of Trump Last week in Cleveland. (Brian Snyder / Reuters) In response to recent items on what Donald Trump is doing, four readers offer views on why. 1) Id laid bare. In response to Time Capsule #54, “They Applauded for Me,” a reader says: Today’s Trump™ Time Capsule reminded me of another example of unaware self-revelation. Some 50 years ago I worked with a guy who volunteered at a meeting the statement, “I don’t get New Yorker cartoons.” He said it not without pride, as though it were somehow a badge of honor. There was no visible rolling of eyes and we went smoothly on with the meeting, but the remark explained much in my later encounters with him. In Vital Lies, Simple Truths: The Psychology of Self-Deception, Daniel Goleman recounts in the preface a story of a woman talking about how much her family loves her, and how funny her mother is. If she was saying something that her mother didn’t like, her mother would just pick up what was at hand and throw it at her. “And once, we were eating dinner, so what she picked up was a knife and threw that at me,” told as a humorous anecdote. Trump is id laid bare, so far as I can tell, and appeals directly to those controlled by the id. *** 2) Big versus little lies. This next reader email is very long but builds to a worthwhile point. Continue Reading Thank you for the Time Capsule series. I think a lot of the commentary from all over on Trump is missing the main question, however. The fundamental question is seldom what people do; the fundamental question is why they do it. Any “rational” analysis of Trump will fail. (“Rational” in both the “logical utility” and in the “sane” sense.) He is not presenting a logical way for attaining real benefits, nor is he presenting himself as sane. What he is selling is fear and anger. It is those two emotions, and just  the emotions, that his supporters want. They want to be deathly afraid of the world, and they want to use that fear to justify an all-consuming anger. They are not looking for justification for those emotions; they just want the emotions themselves. If you see his supporters as masses of the frustrated and disenfranchised who are seeking a voice at the table of power, then it makes no sense. Anybody like that would not want to be lied to. They have been lied to too many times by the powerful. Trump is an obvious liar, and he is never going to do what he says is is going to do. Anyone who simply feels betrayed by the political process isn’t about to set themselves up to be betrayed again. Those types will simply stay home on election day like they always do. There is no point going into who said it, but it was said that “people would rather believe a big lie than a small one.” Once you lie, and once you lie very very big, then you are in constant fear of being found out. The only possible face-saving response is to use the energy of that fear to violently insist that you are right. Once you stand up in public and say you believe that the Earth is flat, then you simply can’t back down. The fear of ridicule is so great that the only way forward is to be angry at all attackers. That anger then becomes its own validity. It is an addiction, pure and simple. It is an addiction to strong empty feelings. No one believes that the Earth is flat because of any logical argument. They believe that the Earth is flat because the panic that is caused by believing that lie sustains their desired anger. And their anger is all they have and all they want. Believing the lie is a deliberate and calculated act to drum up an overriding state of blind emotion. Trump’s big lies are the whole point of his appeal. Hillary’s fault is that she makes small lies (about the e-mails and a lot else). Small lies can be proven to be false, and the small liar shown to be a fool. You can say that you believed her about the e-mails, and then be shown that that small lie was wrong, and then say that she is a scoundrel for fooling you like that. But if you swallow a big lie, you can’t back down. Any backdown would be such a loss of face, that your identity won’t allow it. You get trapped in a world of fear of discovery and anger at your critics and you can’t get out. Most importantly, however, most people don’t want to get out. Most importantly, most people get in that position on purpose. That is why they support Trump. They live off the anger that believing a big lie produces in them. I hate to always be bringing this up, but every year 250,000 Americans die from medical mistakes. That is over 600 a day, every day, all year long. That is more than a fully loaded 747 crashing every day due to preventable errors. And the Wall Street Journal reports that immigrants have a lower crime and incarceration rate than natural-born Americans. Where were the teary-eyed speakers at the RNC talking about their loved ones killed by medical mistakes or by native-born American criminals? There are only a couple hundred thousand more of those to be found than the ones they trotted out. But that is only if you believe in the weight of evidence. There is no either sane or utilitarian reason to put the fear of immigrant criminals or Islamic terrorists anywhere within the top 100 things to worry about in life. But that is not the point. The point isn’t in believing in the truth what that does for you. The whole point is in believing the lie and what that does for you. *** Trump is giving his followers what they want and what they insist on: a big lie that will feed their anger. They want to be lied to so that they can be angry at those who call them liars. That is all they want in life, and Trump is delivering the goods. Trump isn’t doing this because he has some carefully calculated path to power on backs of his supporters. He is doing it because he is an idiot and can’t do anything else. He is just a meaningless tool of the times. The more he lies the more his supporters feed off the anger those lies cause and it goes on and on. The “Vichy Republicans” are just along for the ride, knowing full well that all they want is power and that they will get it and find a way to cover themselves no matter what happens. As you know, in politics, losing is often the best choice, because then you get all of the talk and none of the responsibility. It is all up to democracy. If most of the people want to be lied to so that they can be angry, then goodbye the good old U.S.A. If Hillary isn’t up to bringing out the vote, then that’s the end. But Trump isn’t stopped by showing him to be a liar. That just feeds the beast. You don’t convince someone that the Earth isn’t flat by telling them that they are stupid. They want you to say that, so that they can get angry at you for saying that, and that anger is all they really wanted from the beginning. If you are angry enough you don't have to deal with anything else in the world. It is the cheapest and most powerful drug in the world. And once you are addicted, it is hard to stop. Once you are addicted you simply don't know how to do anything else. And you want more and more of it. You narrow his support by giving his supporters a way out. I think the best way to stop him, as has been pointed out by others, is to simply insult him. That way he will wind it so far out that even his supporters will see the humor in it. Get him to trash talk more about the U.S. and start bringing in UFOs and it will all turn into stand-up comedy even to his supporters. A good laugh puts you in charge, and gets you out. Either that, or he starts insulting pockets of his own supporters, and then they start wondering who is next. Get some surrogates to insult him in public, and trust he handles it badly. Not call him a liar, but actually insult him. He’s afraid of the very thing he does to others. That’s why he does it. Reagan would have put on that famous smile and say “there you go again.” Trump will probably loose it. That and when the Trump U case comes up, he’ll be shown to be a small liar. *** 3) Roots of his appeal. A reader with another tip: Another magazine [apart from The Atlantic!] I’ve recently discovered that has a lot of insightful articles is The American Conservative. Below is a link to a great article discussing the appeal of Trump to the white working class. Yes, this interview with J.D. Vance, author of Hillbilly Elegy, is interesting and important. It intersects with the themes Deb and I have been covering, and we’ll return to it. *** 4) On Trump, Putin, and a bias toward chaos. Last for today: I haven’t slept well since Trump’s RNC speech when it dawned me how close the alignment of Trump’s and Putin’s behavior and interests are. I plead that you dig deeper, much deeper. That you encourage your compatriots to uncover this connection. In general, I am not a conspiracy believer, but Trump certainly is.  I believe that most of us see the world through the prism of our own beliefs. Therefore, Trump believes that the world is run and “won” by using fixers, by rigging the game. This has clearly been how he has operated his businesses and been his experience within New York real estate. Trump says as much in his acceptance speech. Putin has the power and inclination to help Trump fix or tilt our election—with cyber warfare (DNC email leaks?), terrorist attacks, and promoting social unrest. Putin has been in a cold war with us for several years now and has become adept at using asymmetric warfare against democratic nations.  I expect there to be more fear-inspiring activity before and during the DNC, during the Rio Olympics and leading up to election day. Russia can facilitate terrorist groups, even fake terrorism through Chechen connections that can be passed off as ISIS. Russia could fake an Iranian or North Korean cyber attack on the US or an ally (Israel?). They can incite, even arm, the crazies in any democracy. The possibilities are many—arm some militant Black Panthers in the U.S., set off a few car bombs close to the election, send some anthrax around, release some Zika mosquitos, leak embarrassing and incendiary information.   There will be an act of terror somewhere in the world practically every day to light up cable news and remind us how scared we should be, to keep our flag at half mast. How else does the RNC and Trump’s victory speech make any sense? He’s tripled down on chaos. He wins the election only if the electorate is scared and all we want is “law and order.” Trump is not worried that his convention was a mess, that his party is not united or that he has no staff or ground campaign; this is a cable-news assault. Russia helps make the chaos and get Trump elected. In exchange Russia gets the Ukraine, the Baltics, greatly weaken democracies and a narcissistic U.S. President that is prone to their manipulation. Crazy? Yes. Is Trump crazy? Yes. I believe he is crazy enough that there could actually be a direct link between Putin and Trump. Either way, whether a real conspiracy or a confluence of toxic nationalistic waste streams the only vaccine is suspecting the truth before the fact. James Fallows 12:34 PM / July 23, 2016 A Different Kind of 'Trump Nation' Report Dodge City High School Marching Band, “the Pride of Southwest Kansas.” (Red Demon Football on Youtube.) Western Kansas, where Deb and I have spent time over the past month, is the heart of Trump Nation in one sense: Trump and the GOP will almost certainly carry this area, and the whole state, this fall. But if you compared the daily texture of economic, educational, civic, and cultural life in cities like this, with the America-in-the-ashcan end-times tone of political discourse in general, and of the past week in Cleveland in particular, you would wonder about the contrast. The tension between these two basic assessments of 21st century America, and the ways in which each might selectively be true, was the theme of my March issue cover story, and of our on-scene reports from around the country over the past few years collected here. It’s also been part of our previous reports from Kansas here, here, here, and here, with more to come. Deb Fallows has a new installment up this morning. It’s about Dodge City High School: home of two successive Kansas State teachers-of-the-year; source of civic pride; locus of ethnic diversity exceeding that of many big cities; and home, among other things, to a fishing team. You can read her report here, and I hope you will. *** Continue Reading Process note: the balancing act within our own household and inside my own mind, between the increasingly dire aspects of America’s national politics, and the fresh and encouraging developments in most other realms, is our own local reminder of the larger challenge of trying to make sense of the national condition. Maybe I should just fall back on the principle that was so handy in China: Everything you could possibly say about the country is true — somewhere. Maybe I should call it schizophrenia or cognitive dissonance, rather than a balancing act. But most of all I should probably keep the balance in favor of on-the-road reporting, which usually has the virtue of being surprising in positive rather than negative ways. James Fallows 3:10 PM / July 21, 2016 'It's a Trap': What If the Convention Chaos Is All Planned? In a series of posts, I’ve been arguing that the well-publicized chaos of the Republican National Convention provides cautionary evidence on how the Trump organization might handle the scaled-up challenge of running a national campaign. A reader on the West Coast says there is another possibility (and extends the kayfabe analysis from a previous reader ): I’ve been enjoying the past few days of convention meltdown because I love the idea that we may be watching a Donald death spiral. However, a new theory struck me this morning: This might all be a trap (if I’m wrong it’s because I’ve watched too many episodes of Game of Thrones). Here it is: Theory: Some or all of the chaos at the Republican convention is intentional / staged. Evidence: According to NPR, Cruz didn’t go off script. That is, Trump knew what he was gong to say and he let him go up there anyway. Therefore this is no surprise slap in the face as it’s being portrayed. Why: Attention: Trump has consistently shown an ability to profit from attention, and chaos drives more attention. Everyone will be paying attention to his speech tonight. It makes it all about Trump: For instance, Cruz overshadowing Pence is being portrayed as a problem, but if you’re creating a cult of personality, it’s actually a feature not a bug. Now Trump can ride in as the savior. Lowers expectations: You remember how W played this to great effect. In other words, a moderately good speech turns into the turnaround of the century. Sets a trap: Trump can use all the attention on the horserace (which is a media obsession) to paint himself as the outsider candidate: “All the media cares about is the soap opera, meanwhile I’m gonna make America great again! Let’s get rid of these jokers who have been driving this country into the ground.” For a public that hates the political class, the right speech tonight could be a big breakout moment. Bonus is that Hillary will look totally wooden when she pulls off an organized convention. Old narrative: well organized conventions are key to a successful presidential bid. New narrative: conventions are the band camp for political losers I hope I’m wrong, but worry I hear the Rains of Castamere playing in the background. For analytical completeness, it’s worth comparing this possibility with “Trump’s Razor,” as explained most recently by Josh Marshall at TPM.  (Premise of the razor: “Ascertain the stupidest possible scenario that can be reconciled with the available facts.”) My life experience inclines me to razor-style, as opposed to trap-style, interpretations of most events. But no one knows anything for sure right now. James Fallows 2:11 PM / July 21, 2016 The Trump Era Dawns Ted Cruz addresses the Republican convention. (Jorge Bueno / Wikimedia commons) Readers respond to this stage in our national pageant. Is it all just kayfabe? From a reader in the Northwest: Maybe it’s time to stop looking to political pundits to analyze Trump, because politics is the wrong lens? Trump isn’t a politician; he’s a performer. Maybe we should be asking directors and producers to explain what we are witnessing: drama, and nothing more. Why did he let Cruz speak in primetime without a guarantee of an endorsement? Political ineptitude, or dramatic genius? It was a pro wrestling moment. Betrayal, treachery, defiance! What better way to set up a scene of triumphant revenge! Are Cruz, Christie, Pence, and his own family unwitting or semi-witting extras in Trump’s improvisational “kayfabe”? Is this all just a corollary to PT Barnum’s quote about bad publicity: “There’s no such thing as bad drama?” *** It’s getting out of hand. This reader is less amused: One of the many concerns with watching a man like Trump edge closer to becoming the most powerful man in the world is the growing feeling that there is nothing anyone can do to stop it. And that we’ve seen this before. And that this is something new and unbelievable. And frightening. Mostly frightening. There are so, so many rational arguments against him and none of them matter despite many of them being of the utmost importance. Years of over-the-top mudslinging have made us all numb to criticism of his very real faults. It’s not that there are Teflon politicians. It’s just that there are people who don’t care about the charges made against them. They care about ratcheting up the attack even more so that they look good by comparison. So here we are, scraping from the bottom of the scum pond for rhetoric to hurl. It’s a certainty that the people chanting “lock her up” believe simultaneously that she deserves to be locked up, and that they are engaging in the same type of hyperbolic arguments that they think are being made against Trump. Like Mr. Goldberg’s assertion that Trump = Putin, which I can’t even tell whether it is hyperbole or not. Or Donald Trump: Sociopath? Yet I think that none of this is effective. In fact, all of it contributes to the success of the Republican call for change, which is made more effective because the change is being proposed in the form of a very, very much non-politician. Who wouldn’t want change in such a toxic election? I just hope someone can come up with an idea on the Democrat side, something that everyone can rally behind. Things are getting desperate. *** Continue Reading Not a deal but a relationship. A reader responses to Time Capsule #49, on Trump’s willingness to walk away from a deal: “You always have to be prepared to walk”: Trump really relishes deal-making and negotiations, and rightly so. The rules he plays by—regardless of whether they’re anyone else’s rules—appear to serve him well. What’s scary is that he seems to treat everything like a negotiation. As you point out, we don’t just have a deal with, say, Japan; we have a relationship. Relationships aren’t always easy, and the strongest ones require hard work to maintain. It’s hard not to compare this to his marriages. We can’t just get divorced from Japan or South Korea or Estonia every so often and go start over with younger, seemingly more exciting allies. *** The Cruz gamble: I am a Texan and I despise Ted Cruz. But he is one of the few to stand up to Trump. I have never voted for a Democrat for President, but this year will be the first. I would have hoped that Cruz would have done the right thing and clearly stated that as flawed as Hillary is, Trump is unfit for office. He did the next best thing. I think it’s brilliant politics. What are the chances that Trump self-destructs before the election, or God help us as President? Very high, I’d say. Cruz can say he was right when it happens. Also, he sets himself up to run against Trump in Republican primaries in 2020 as the “I told you so” candidate. He could also run as as 3rd party candidate and get significant support as the only conservative in the race.

Spencer saluted more than 200 attendees on Saturday, gathered at the Ronald Reagan Building in Washington, D.C., for the annual conference of the National Policy Institute, which describes itself as “an independent organization dedicated to the heritage, identity, and future of  people of European descent in the United States, and around the world.” Spencer has popularized the term “alt-right” to describe the movement he leads. Spencer has said his dream is “a new society, an ethno-state that would be a gathering point for all Europeans,” and has called for “peaceful ethnic cleansing.” For most of the day, a parade of speakers discussed their ideology in relatively anodyne terms, putting a presentable face on their agenda. But after dinner, when most journalists had already departed, Spencer rose and delivered a speech to his followers dripping with anti-Semitism, and leaving no doubt as to what he actually seeks. He referred to the mainstream media as “Lügenpresse,” a term he said he was borrowing from “the original German”; the Nazis used the word to attack their critics in the press. Continue Reading Mike Segar / Reuters The Electoral College Was Meant to Stop Men Like Trump From Being President Peter Beinart The founders envisioned electors as people who could prevent an irresponsible demagogue from taking office. Americans talk about democracy like it’s sacred. In public discourse, the more democratic American government is, the better. The people are supposed to rule. But that’s not the premise that underlies America’s political system. Most of the men who founded the United States feared unfettered majority rule. James Madison wrote in Federalist 10 that systems of government based upon “pure democracy … have ever been found incompatible with personal security or the rights of property.” John Adams wrote in 1814 that, “Democracy never lasts long. It soon wastes, exhausts and murders itself.” The framers constructed a system that had democratic features. The people had a voice. They could, for instance, directly elect members of the House of Representatives. But the founders also self-consciously limited the people’s voice.

But we also use it when we’re all alone; it shapes even our silent relationships with ourselves. In his book, The Voices Within, Charles Fernyhough gives a historical overview of “inner speech”—the more scientific term for “talking to yourself in your head.” Fernyhough, a professor at Durham University in the U.K., says that inner speech develops alongside social speech. This idea was pioneered by Lev Vygotsky, a Russian psychologist who studied children in the 1920s and noted that when they learned to talk to other humans, they also learned how to talk to themselves, first out loud, and eventually, in their heads. Continue Reading Yamada Taro / Getty What’s So Great About American World Leadership? Hugh White The U.S. voters who rejected decades of bipartisan foreign-policy consensus might be on to something. How has America come to elect a president who so starkly repudiated decades’ worth of the largely bipartisan vision of U.S. global leadership? And if that vision won’t be the basis of American foreign policy in the 21st century, what will replace it? The big message of 2016 is that large numbers of American voters, Democrat and Republican, do not buy what their political leaders have been selling for so long, and that includes foreign policy. The evidence of this from Trump’s victory is reinforced by Senator Bernie Sanders’ remarkable showing in the Democratic primaries, and by years’ worth of public-opinion surveys showing the widespread view that the United States “does too much in helping solve world problems.” It is also reinforced by the high poll numbers of an outgoing president who has mounted his own quiet campaign against key elements of Washington’s foreign-policy orthodoxy. Continue Reading Carlo Allegri / Reuters Donald Trump's Conflicts of Interest: A Crib Sheet Jeremy Venook A semi-comprehensive list of the business concerns that may influence the president-elect as he prepares for the nation’s highest office Though several previous presidents have entered office with private fortunes to their names, none has done so with a business empire nearly as large or complicated as that of President-elect Donald J. Trump. Estimates of Trump’s wealth vary substantially: While he self-reports a net worth of $10 billion, independent agencies have arrived at valuation generally between $3 billion and $5 billion. The unprecedented nature of Trump’s business interests, coupled with the many precedents that Trump broke throughout his campaign—not releasing his tax returns, for example, which severely limits attempts to understand his financial situation—has provoked speculation that his presidency may bring about equally unprecedented opportunities for conflicts of interest. Trump’s response—provided on Twitter—only reinforces concerns that he will make little effort to avoid entangling his business and personal interests, and will instead attack those who point that out.

In February 1990, thanks to a 15-year-old boy named Bruno Kowalsczewski, footsteps echoed through the chambers of Bruniquel Cave for the first time in tens of thousands of years. The cave sits in France’s scenic Aveyron Valley, but its entrance had long been sealed by an ancient rockslide. Kowalsczewski’s father had detected faint wisps of air emerging from the scree, and the boy spent three years clearing away the rubble. He eventually dug out a tight, thirty-meter-long passage that the thinnest members of the local caving club could squeeze through. They found themselves in a large, roomy corridor. There were animal bones and signs of bear activity, but nothing recent. The floor was pockmarked with pools of water. The walls were punctuated by stalactites (the ones that hang down) and stalagmites (the ones that stick up). Continue Reading sketchblog/flickr Masters of Love Emily Esfahani Smith Science says lasting relationships come down to—you guessed it—kindness and generosity. Every day in June, the most popular wedding month of the year, about 13,000 American couples will say “I do,” committing to a lifelong relationship that will be full of friendship, joy, and love that will carry them forward to their final days on this earth. Except, of course, it doesn’t work out that way for most people. The majority of marriages fail, either ending in divorce and separation or devolving into bitterness and dysfunction. Of all the people who get married, only three in ten remain in healthy, happy marriages, as psychologist Ty Tashiro points out in his book The Science of Happily Ever After, which was published earlier this year. Social scientists first started studying marriages by observing them in action in the 1970s in response to a crisis: Married couples were divorcing at unprecedented rates. Worried about the impact these divorces would have on the children of the broken marriages, psychologists decided to cast their scientific net on couples, bringing them into the lab to observe them and determine what the ingredients of a healthy, lasting relationship were. Was each unhappy family unhappy in its own way, as Tolstoy claimed, or did the miserable marriages all share something toxic in common? Continue Reading Chris Keane / Reuters What's Really Going On in North Carolina's Gubernatorial Race? David A. Graham Recounts, lawsuits, challenges—and the prospect of a legislative coup? Here’s why the race between Governor Pat McCrory and Democrat Roy Cooper isn’t over yet. DURHAM, N.C.—It’s been two weeks since Election Day, which means that in 49 states, residents know who their governor will be next year. North Carolinians, however, are still waiting to see. At the end of balloting on November 8, Democrat Roy Cooper, the current state attorney general, had a lead of a few thousand votes over Governor Pat McCrory, a Republican. Cooper promptly declared victory, but McCrory has not conceded the race, and the state has not been able to declare a winner. On Monday, Cooper announced a transition team, while McCrory accused him of “circumventing the electoral process.” Cooper’s lead fluctuated throughout the day on Tuesday as more counties returned their final canvass, but as of writing it was a little more than 6,000 votes out of roughly 4,700,000.

The typical 29-year-old is living with a partner in the suburbs—without a bachelor’s degree. What is the typical life experience for an American on the verge of turning 30? This is a hard question to answer, no matter who is asking. But it’s become especially difficult for an industry responsible with providing the answers: the national press. An irony of digital media is that the Internet distributes journalism, but it concentrates journalists. Jobs at media sites like The Atlantic, BuzzFeed, or Gawker are five-times more likely to be located in New York or Washington, D.C., than television-news jobs. The clustering force is only getting more centripetal: The share of reporting jobs in Los Angeles, NYC, and DC increased by 60 percent between 2004 and 2014. It’s easy to imagine many downsides of this agglomeration, like the dissolution of local reporting, but a subtler risk is that well-educated journalists in these dense cities wind up with a skewed impression of the world, a “majority illusion” based on the extremely unrepresentative cross-section of the country that’s immediately around them. To be fair, being a reporter in Des Moines or rural Nebraska, while it provides a better view of Des Moines and rural Nebraska, doesn’t offer a universal window into the average experiences of all Americans, either. For that, one needs something else, like a national survey.

CDT August 08, 2016 Photo provided by The Sunlight Foundation. (Photo: Courtesy - The Sunlight Foundation) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST Thanks to the Texas Supreme Court, McAllen taxpayers cannot find out how much their city paid Enrique Iglesias to belt out his Latin pop lyrics at a holiday parade. And Houston cannot release, among other information, how many driver permits it has issued to ride-hailing giant Uber. A Kaufman County school district’s food service deal? Much of that is now secret, as are details of a Texas Department of Insurance contract for interpretation services. Those are a few instances among many over the past year in which Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton’s office told local governments not to release information to the public because it is now shielded by a state Supreme Court ruling protecting the secrets of private companies doing business with government agencies. Such records were considered public before the court's ruling last year, and open government experts call the decision a broadly written accommodation of business interests that is ripe for abuse. Now, Texas lawmakers are considering ways to patch up what one calls a “monstrous loophole” in public records law. “Every single private organization can essentially shut down any information they gave a government entity in perpetuity,” said state Rep. Giovanni Capriglione, R-Southlake, who is working with open records advocates on a legislative fix. In the June 2015 ruling, the justices ordered Paxton to block the release of certain information in a lease between Boeing and the Port Authority of San Antonio because the aerospace manufacturer said making the details public could tip off its competitors. The ruling expanded the secrecy of government contracts in two key ways, experts say: by broadening an exemption in public records law used to protect the government’s competitive interests and by affirming that businesses could invoke it, too. In recent years, the state would withhold otherwise-public records only if their release significantly hindered government’s ability to get a good deal in the marketplace. Even that application was wider than what the Legislature intended when it created the exemption decades ago, said Joe Larsen, an open government attorney who also serves on the Freedom of Information Foundation of Texas. Originally, lawmakers sought to prevent a bidder for government work from nabbing a competitor’s bids on a contract. And once that contract was finalized, it was considered public, Larsen said. Not anymore, particularly after the Boeing v. Paxton decision. It lowered the threshold for what can be secret, while affirming that private entities — when government informs them about someone's request for their information — could invoke the protection when doing government business in Texas. The test for disclosure “is whether knowing another bidder’s overhead costs would be an advantage, not whether it would be a decisive advantage,” Justice John Devine wrote in his majority opinion. Trend toward secrecy Private and public entities have since seized on ruling, using it to persuade Paxton’s office to rule in their favor in a host of records disputes. That’s leaving taxpayers in dark about some government spending — like how much McAllen paid Iglesias for an hourlong concert that featured hit such as "Bailando” and “El Perdon,” according to local news reports. The city has withheld the records since local news media requested them, arguing that the government has “specific marketplace interests” in the information and releasing it would “place the city at a competitive disadvantage” when negotiating future contracts, according to a March 7 ruling from Paxton’s office. The letter sided with the city and referenced the Boeing decision. City officials told the Tribune that they had no additional comment. Paxton’s ruling in the McAllen case echoed many others he has issued over the past year. Some specifically mention that the requested information was considered public before the Boeing decision. This trend worries advocates of government transparency. “If there’s a place where corruption can fester, it’s here,” Larsen said. “It’s the interface between those who are seeking to work for the government and the government. That’s where the money is.” Now, some Texas lawmakers say they're ready to address the issue next legislative session. Capriglione said his bill, still in draft form, would essentially return Texas to life before the Boeing ruling, which he said undermined efforts last session to increase transparency in state contracting. “We want to go back to where the governmental entity essentially gets the power of that exemption.”  He may get bipartisan help. State Rep. Terry Canales, D-Edinburg, is also drafting legislation — spurred by the tussle over the Iglesias contract — that would address the Boeing ruling and specifically list entertainment contracts with the government as public documents.  Steering the bill though the Legislature could prove tricky because the issue is so far-reaching, said Curtis Smith, his chief of staff.  “Often we want to limit the effect of our bills,” he said. “But this touches everything. Everyone will have an opinion on it.”  Some exceptions to the trend Paxton hasn’t sided with everyone who has invoked Boeing to evade transparency. Last April, Assistant Attorney General Nicholas Ybarra wrote that Chesapeake Energy failed to show it would face “substantial harm to its competitive position” if the Fort Worth Independent School District released details of its $1 million settlement with the natural gas driller — a resolution of a royalty payment dispute.  More recently, Paxton sided with The Texas Tribune when chemical manufacturer BASF sought to keep secret information related to a $2.4 million Texas Enterprise Fund grant announced in 2015. Last month, the company sued, asking a Travis County district court to prevent Gov. Greg Abbott's office from releasing what it called “sensitive, proprietary, information regarding BASF’s means, methods, and costs.” Larsen said he was surprised that Paxton had sided with the Tribune, considering the persuasiveness of the Boeing argument. Bill Cobb, a former deputy in the attorney general’s office, said BASF may have failed on a technicality, since it did not submit a sworn statement detailing how the release would damage the company (Such statements aren't required, but Cobb said his former employer likes to have them). Or, perhaps, the decision was just one inconsistency from an office that has already churned out more than 1,700 letter rulings this year. It was unlikely that BASF, which cited Boeing, lost on the merits alone, Cobb said. Click here to read this story in its original home with our content partners at The Texas Tribune.

News Business Business News Airbus bribery investigation launched by Serious Fraud Office Probe adds to scrutiny of the role played by cross-border intermediaries, including Monaco-based Unaoil Julie Johnsson, Mark Deen, Andrea Rothman Monday 8 August 2016 07:32 BST Click to follow The Independent Online Airbus A350 plane pictured at the Berlin Airshow in June - the company is accused of hiring third party consultants who bribed officials Reuters Airbus said the UK Serious Fraud Office has opened a criminal investigation into allegations of fraud, bribery and corruption relating to some of its third-party consultants. The Toulouse-based planemaker said in a statement Sunday that it’s cooperating with investigators probing its civil aviation business.  Airbus had flagged to UK regulators and the European Export Credit Agencies earlier this year “misstatements and omissions” involving the outside contractors in some export financing applications, which it found through an internal probe. Read more BP signed contracts with firm linked to bribery, Panama Papers reveal The credit agencies, including UK Export Finance, have suspended some of the backstop financing that Airbus uses to help sell commercial aircraft since the first revelations made four months ago. Airbus said in a 27 July statement that a process for re-establishing export credit “has been agreed and is ongoing.” Until the financing is restored, Airbus and rival Boeing face the challenge of navigating an uncertain market with limited government assistance. Chicago-based Boeing has been unable to tap trade financing because a congressional impasse has left the US Export-Import bank with too few directors to approve deals. Jefferies Equity Research estimates that export-credit agencies last year provided 7 per cent of financing for Airbus plane deliveries, compared with 45 per cent from leasing companies and 40 per cent from airlines themselves. The Airbus investigation adds to the scrutiny of the role played by cross-border intermediaries. Monaco-based Unaoil SAM, which served as a go-between for companies and officials in the Middle East, Africa and former Soviet countries, was searched by authorities earlier this year amid allegations of corruption.

Despite the minimal sentences, the ruling was described by Deltour’s lawyer as “shocking” and “a terrible anomaly.” The ruling “puts on guard future whistle-blowers,” Deltour told reporters.The LuxLeaks revelations sped beyond Luxembourg, causing European Union regulators to expand a tax-subsidy probe and propose new laws to fight corporate tax dodging, while EU lawmakers created a special committee to probe fiscal deals across the 28-nation bloc. reuters 6/17 Goldman Sachs dealmakers lavished Libyan officials with prostitutes to win contract - June 2016 A former Goldman Sachs dealmaker trying to persuade Gadaffi-era Libya to invest $1 billion with the investment bank procured prostitutes and invited Libyan officials to lavish parties in the hope of winning the business, the High Court heard on Monday June 13.The Libyan Investment Authority sovereign wealth fund is suing Goldman Sachs for inappropriately coercing its naïve staff into giving its sovereign wealth fund cash to the bank to invest in products they did not understand.

A Swiss criminal investigation into the pair is ongoing. Getty Images 17/17 Libor fraudster City trader Tom Hayes, 35, has become the first person to be convicted of rigging Libor rates following a trial at London's Southwark Crown Court. Hayes worked as a trader in yen derivatives at UBS before joining the American bank Citigroup in Tokyo. He was fired from Citigroup following an investigation into his trading methods. He returned to the UK in December 2012 and was arrested following a two-and-a-half year criminal investigation by the SFO. Getty Images “This will have some negative impact,” said Shukor Yusof, founder of aviation consulting firm Endau Analytics in Malaysia. “Third-party consultants or intermediaries have often caused worries. The business of aircraft sale is so intense and competitive that there are people trying many avenues.” Airbus said in the 27 July filing that it’s undertaking a sweeping review involving “legal, investigative, and forensic accounting” of consultants and other third parties used to support sales. The company said it’s also using greater due diligence to screen potential contractors. “The group cannot exclude that the comprehensive review and these enhancements of its controls and practices lead to additional commercial disputes or other consequences in the future,” the filing said. © Bloomberg More about: Airbus Serious Fraud Office Reuse content Comments Most Popular Video Sponsored Features Follow us: User Policies Privacy Policy Cookie Policy Code of Conduct Complaint Form Contact Us Contributors All Topics Archive Newsletters Jobs Subscriptions Advertising Guide Syndication Evening Standard Novaya Gazeta Install our Apps Close We've noticed that you are using an ad blocker.

Close share panel Image copyright PA Image caption The Chinooks are maintained at Fleetlands with technical support from Odiham and other UK locations Apprenticeships at a helicopter repair site which currently maintains the UK's Chinook fleet have been stopped for the first time in its history. Vector Aerospace, which runs the Fleetlands site in Gosport, Hampshire, blamed a drop in workload for its decision to suspend the 2017 intake. It comes after the firm recently lost out on a contract to upgrade some of the Chinooks, putting 60 jobs at risk. The site was sold by the MoD to Vector in 2008. It has offered apprenticeships at its training facility for the past 75 years, taking about eight apprentices each year in Gosport in recent times. The three-year programme offers successful applicants the chance to get hands-on experience on the maintenance, repair and overhaul of rotary wing aircraft. Image copyright PA Image caption The then-prime minister David Cameron announced a Chinook contract at Fleetlands during a visit to Portsmouth in February Fleetlands history Opened in 1940 to repair and overhaul naval fixed-wing aircraft, including the Hawker Sea Fury and Supermarine Seafire Known as the Royal Naval Air Yard, the establishment gradually started dealing with helicopters as the number of them in service grew As most fixed-wing aircraft in the Navy disappeared towards the end of the century, the site became the main location for rotary wing maintenance In 1999, the Defence Aviation Repair Agency (DARA) was formed to take over the work and maintained Army and RAF helicopters, along with naval aircraft In 2008, the Fleetlands facility was bought by Vector Aerospace and supported Chinooks as well as Lynx and Sea King helicopters until they went out of service Gosport MP Caroline Dinenage, who has been in talks with Vector and union representatives at Fleetlands, said it was "extremely disappointing" to see the scheme suspended. She added: "The company provides an excellent pipeline for young people from our area to gain technical skills for a rewarding career. I understand this decision will be reviewed over the coming year and I will be urging them to reconsider." A Vector spokesman said it was disappointed to suspend the scheme but was "fully committed to our current apprentices" and would review the programme in the coming year. The private firm works closely with Boeing, which builds military craft for the Ministry of Defence, and had been expecting to secure a contract to upgrade the fleet with a Digital Automatic Flight Control System (DAFCS). 'Constructive negotiations' But Boeing decided to take the work in-house, despite Vector previously completing another Chinook upgrade package for the manufacturer. Vector is talking with union officials to try and transfer some staff to Boeing but no guarantees have been given. The company's long-term deal with Boeing to provide maintenance of the Chinook fleet has not been affected. Steve Burnell, managing director of Aircraft Support Boeing, said the decision not to award Vector the contract came after a "long and detailed study on the grounds of cost". A Unite spokesperson said it was "engaged in constructive negotiations with the Vector management" but declined to comment further. The Fleetlands site, which has historically supported the MoD's helicopter fleet, has seen its workload shrink in recent years after the Sea King and Lynx helicopters went out of service. Vector, which employs 800 people in Gosport, moved into the civil aviation market to boost its workload.

The center monitors video cameras, license plate readers, shot spotter and other streams of information to fight crime. Photo by David Carson, dcarson@post-dispatch.com Gary Kreie is a numbers guy. A retired software engineer from Boeing, he used to work on advanced missile systems. Now he has a new passion. In his spare time, he crunches numbers on comparing St. Louis to other cities in the nation. “I’ve been complaining for a long time that all these city rankings are unfair,” says Kreie, who lives in Des Peres. The ones that bug him the most are the ones that compare cities by crime. St. Louis often gets labeled one of the most dangerous cities in the country, in part because the crime in the city’s urban core is often compared with cities with a much larger footprint. As a result, the region Kreie, 65, has called home for 39 years gets a bad rap. He’s hardly the first to note this reality, yet another of the negative effects of having the city of St. Louis and St. Louis County operate as two separate governmental entities. Three years ago, for instance, the city and county police chiefs asked the FBI to consider reporting the city and county crime rates together, rather than separately, to make the comparison with other, more unified cities more fair. The proposal fell on deaf ears. The move would have dropped St. Louis immediately from one of the most dangerous cities in the country to one of the safest. Kreie, though, is a problem solver. He doesn’t just want the crime numbers to be reported more accurately, he also wants the region to work together to reduce the crime rate where it is highest, in the urban core. To that end, he has an idea that may seem radical to some. Kreie wants his West County neighbors — and those in the entire metropolitan statistical area of St. Louis — to pay higher taxes in order to attack the crime problem in the city’s urban core. Kreie’s motivation is selfish. He believes that reducing crime in the urban core will raise property values throughout the region. Last month, Kreie published his proposal on the St. Louis Strong website (stlstrong1764.org). The nonprofit was started by Chesterfield native Jake Hollander, who left a public relations job in Washington to come back to his hometown and be a part of the movement to unite the city and the county. Lately, the website has been asking people to weigh in with ideas for consolidation in the region. In February, Kreie started comparing crime numbers and home values in various cities across the country, and what he found surprised him. St. Louis, it turns out, has the largest disparity between suburban crime and urban crime in the country, based on how he breaks down the numbers by ZIP code. He expected to find home values correlating with low suburban crime, but that’s not what the numbers showed. Plenty of places with similarly low suburban crime have much higher home values than St. Louis. But, based on his research, there appears to be a direct connection between low home values and a high disparity in the crime rates between urban cores and surrounding suburbs. Kreie’s solution — with the goal of raising property values throughout St. Louis — is for the suburbs to increase their property taxes for a period of time, in order to intensely fight crime in the city. “Getting resources to the urban core will raise everybody’s property values,” Kreie says. “St. Louis needs to think more regionally. We’re not getting resources from the outer region and the suburbs into the core.” In comparing St. Louis to Minneapolis, for instance, Kreie notes that the overall crime index there is lower, and home values are higher. What sort of investment would the average homeowner in the region make if they could reduce the crime rate in St. Louis while raising their home value over a period of 10 or 12 years? Kreie’s math says the investment would pay off. He leaves to the experts how that money should be spent: more police officers, better schools, programs to reduce gun violence. But he hopes the folks who live where he does see the value in making such an investment. “We’ve got to find a regional solution to our crime problem,” Kreie says. “Maybe economics is the only thing that will convince people in the suburbs to think regionally.” Tony Messenger • 314-340-8518 @tonymess on Twitter tmessenger@post-dispatch.com Tags Tony Messenger Crime St. Louis Strong Better Together Jake Hollander Gary Kreie St. Louis Boeing Value Tony Messenger Tony Messenger is the metro columnist for the St. Louis Post-Dispatch.

The Boeing 777 disappeared on March 8, 2014 en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing with 239 people onboard, most of them Chinese. An extensive underwater hunt in the southern Indian Ocean has not yet found the crash site, fueling speculation it may be outside the current search zone, particularly if someone was at the controls at the end of the flight. A manned plane could have been glided down, allowing it to enter the water outside the 120,000-square-kilometer area being searched, some aviation experts have suggested. But extensive testing by aircraft manufacturer Boeing and new Australian defense department data analysis both suggest that — regardless of the possible actions of one or both of the pilots — the jet dived into the ocean at high speed, The Australian reported. Once MH370 ran out of fuel and the engines flamed, it slowed before plunging down toward the water in a series of swoops — dropping from 10,668 meters at a rate of between 3,658 meters a minute and 6,096 meters a minute, Boeing said, according to the report. The sharp dive was confirmed by a new data analysis by Australia’s defense department involving signals sent automatically between the plane and a satellite, the head of the agency leading the MH370 hunt said. Australian Transport and Safety Bureau chief Greg Hood said this supported the view MH370 “was likely to have crashed in the 120,000-square-kilometre area now being searched,” the paper said. The area was defined under the ATSB’s “most likely” scenario that no one was at the controls and the plane ran out of fuel. “The Australians leading the search do not doubt that the pilot may well have been responsible for the jet’s disappearance but they say critics of the search strategy are wrong to assume that means they are looking in the wrong place,” the report added.

View Latest Posts >>> ‘MH370 fell out of sky after engine failure’ By Ian Greenhalgh on August 9, 2016 It was a scheduled passenger flight from Kuala Lumpur bound for Beijing and had 239 passengers and crew on board when it disappeared It is more than two years since MH370 literally vanished into thin air and we are still none the wiser about what really happened to the plane and it’s passengers and crew. There have been a few pieces of wreckage washed up around the shores of the Indian Ocean and now this signal analysis, but to be quite frank, I don’t believe any of it, I think it’s just disinfo, part of the psyop. I don’t believe the official story that the plane turned south and flew out into the empty southern oceans until it ran out of fuel and crashed into the sea to never be seen again, I never have.  So what do I think happened to MH370? To be brutally honest, I don’t know and in the absence of any concrete evidence I am reluctant to even make a guess. There have been a handful of tantalising pieces of circumstantial evidence that points to a very different narrative to the official one. Notorious Israeli disinfo mouthpiece Christopher Bollyn gave us a big fat clue that his Israeli masters were at least partly involved when he wrote a mysterious article about a Boeing painted in Malaysian Airlines livery being stored awaiting an unknown purpose in a hangar in Israel. Most of the rest of the most intriguing clues to the MH370 case are actually part of the MH17 story – a virtually identical Boeing of the same Malaysian Airlines that crashed into a field in Ukraine. As someone who rarely believes in coincidences, I believe that the MH370 and MH17 cases are linked, and probably very directly linked. I won’t go so far as to state that I believe, as some do, that MH370, after disappearing, was next seen in smoking pieces in a Ukrainian field pretending to be MH17, but I will go as far as to say that I am very open to the possibility of that being the case. VT published a story that originally appeared in a French publication that alleged that the bodies from the MH17 crash glowed in the twilight as they lay in that Ukrainian field and that this luminescent glow was caused by the formaldehyde that the bodies had been preserved in – the implication being that these were the bodies of the passengers of MH370. That story has never been fully verified, neither have the rumours that many of the bodies were clearly Chinese (most of the MH370 passengers were Chinese) or that the bodies were already quite rotten when they hit the ground. A refridgerated train was brought in to move the bodies into with the reason given that in the hot summer weather, putrefaction was setting in, which could support the theory too. Ultimately, there are still far too many unknowns in both the MH370 and MH17 cases for us to be able to form a solid hypothesis of what really happened; however, when it comes to who did it, there are some more pieces of circumstantial evidence to consider. Firstly, Malaysia had hosted a war crimes tribunal in it’s capital, Kuala Lumpur that found both the state of Israel and a senior Israel general guilty of crimes against humanity for the massacres at the Sabbra and Shattila refugee camps in the 1980s, that fact provides a significant motive. Secondly, flight MH17 supposedly originated at Schiphol airport which is notorious as the hub of the Israeli international arms smuggling/dealing operation, a Mossad base and were the security is in the hands of infamous Israeli security company (or should that be Mossad front) ICTS. Until more solid evidence comes along, we remain largely in the dark about the true story of the two Malaysian Airlines flights; however, we can say with a fair degree of certainty that this new release of signal analysis by the Australians is just another part of the cover-up and can be disregarded as evidence. __________ Business Standard ‘MH370 fell out of sky after engine failure’ Australian defence scientists who analysed signals from missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 have revealed the Boeing 777 fell very fast before crashing into the Indian Ocean off the coast of western Australia. Australian media reported on Tuesday that data analysis and manufacturer simulations showed it was likely the aircraft lost engine power before falling out of the sky at a rate of up to 20,000 feet per minute on March 8, 2014, Xinhua news agency reported. An aircraft attempting a regular landing – or a crash landing in water – would descend at a rate of around 2,000 feet per minute, raising doubts over previous predictions that the plane “landed” intact in the water before breaking up, the analysts said. Australian scientists believed that prior to its final moments, the jet made a number of automated “handshake” signals with satellites on the ground near Perth in Western Australia. After six of those handshakes, a seventh, out-of-sequence signal came from the jet, indicating engine failure likely from lack of fuel. The data gives life to the theory that MH370 fell out of the sky, and did not glide to a final crash-landing spot in the Indian Ocean. Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) chief commissioner Greg Hood said the scientists’ analysis of the signals closely matched a flight scenario in which there was no pilot at the controls at the point of impact – in contrast to previous theories about how MH370 went down. Hood said the signal data meant MH370 likely crashed in the 120,000-square-km search area now being combed by Australian authorities. If the aircraft had glided to a final resting place – as previous theories had hinted – the plane may have gone down outside of the current search area. MH370 was a scheduled passenger flight from Kuala Lumpur bound for Beijing. It had 239 passengers and crew on board when it disappeared on March 8, 2014. Related Posts: MH370 Revisited Yet Again!

FaceBook Comments 10 Responses to "‘MH370 fell out of sky after engine failure’" roger  August 10, 2016 at 8:13 pm Those having some understanding on Early Warning Radars, do know that Australia´s OTH (over the Horizon) radars have surpassing coverage to detect the very balyhooed MH370 course straight down the South Indian Ocean, close to Australia; much more considering that a 777 has a size that can hardly be missed by radars, even by less advanced types. The fact that Australia volunteered to be in charge of the search, doesn´t explain the denial to hand over the radar records requested by Malaysian authorities. Also, an air Marshall of RAAF recommended to direct the operations when in case, most of the work was done by ships and ocean work calls for naval expertise. So far, the Maldives people witnessing the low flying 777 has more credibility than a computer revelations, that might be just theoretical ruminating. No farewell message or reasonable causes that may have forced the pilot to such a drastic decision cannot be a clue seriously considered. Most suicides are accompanied with a message to have the rest World as spectators of personal drama, as such, disappearing without traces would be a countersense.

Government has classified data, which they sometimes choose to share with corporations with a need to know. The engine telemetry data collection was part of a program to flight follow twin-engined airliners to confirm that they could safely operate over open oceans. RR confirmed the telemetry data was being received and at what time the transmission stopped. Which is why they had to expand the search field and find a new (false) probable drop point.

INMARSAT controls most international air trafﬁc control communications systems. According to Silverman, during the earlier disappearance of Malaysian Airlines ﬂight MH370, the ﬂight was “lost” due to Inmarsat turning off their signals, and it still refuses today to release the data it has about this ﬂight”. . …INMARSAT…originally founded in 1979, a not-for-proﬁt, set up at the behest of the International Maritime Organization , a UN body, for the purpose of establishing a satellite communications network for the maritime community. When the organization was converted into a private company in 1999, the business was split into two parts…the largest single owner of INMARSAT: Harbinger Capital March 2008 it was disclosed that U.S. Hedge Fund Harbinger Capital owned 28% of the company. Harbinger Group Inc. (NYSE:HRG), formerly Zapata Corporation, is a holding company based in Rochester, New York, and originating from an oil company started by a group including the former US president George H. W. Bush. Links between the company and the United States Central Intelligence Agency exist . In 2009, it was renamed the Harbinger Group Inc. in an attempt to thwart such afﬁliations”….from A Little Bit of Prestidigitation – Chip Tatum Log in to Reply Zaguero  August 9, 2016 at 5:50 pm “Australian scientists believed that prior to its final moments, the jet made a number of automated “handshake” signals with satellites on the ground near Perth in Western Australia.” Satellites on the ground?

Log in to Reply Dan Sheppard  August 9, 2016 at 5:24 pm The ‘Diego Garcia’ theory on MH370 is by far the most promising of them all so far, with an actual evidence the phone data provided by missing passenger Phillip Wood to support this theory. The Freescale Electronics Superconductor Patent ownership was the motive, this theory is also supported by the fact that Washington/Pentagon and its cronies are currently trying in anyway they can to limit China’s military intelligence capabilities, as these superconductors would of been used by China in military drone and missile hardware. Both incidents involving MH370 and MH17 were ‘two birds one stone’ attacks, both aircraft were taken out to ‘punish’ Kuala Lumpur, but also, both aircraft had the underlying motive, one with the Superconductor patent, and the other (MH17) with the 6 AIDS Researchers and Delegates heading to a conference in Melbourne.

All Boeing planes have Uninterruptible Auto Pilot feature which in effect makes hijacking impossible. Such planes cannot disappear. Scientists working on nano computers to guide weaponry were on board. They were flown on to Israel for slave labor on the aforementioned project to give Zionist supremacy in such miniature weaponry.

You are also correct about RR, MH370 was never missing, RR and therefore the British govt, always knew exactly where it was.

Follow @NASASpaceFlight Home Forums L2 Sign Up ISS Commercial Shuttle SLS/Orion Russian European Chinese Unmanned Other Pad hardware changes preview new era for Space Coast August 9, 2016 by Chris Bergin Ongoing work at the Kennedy Space Center and Cape Canaveral is continuing to lay the groundwork to once again launch American astronauts from home soil. While the huge Pad 39B equipment enters a critical period of testing at KSC for the Space Launch System, the Crew Access Arm and White Room is scheduled to be installed on the SLC-41 pad in the coming days, in preparation for Starliner missions. Starliner: Even before Boeing’s progression into 2012’s Commercial Crew integrated Capability (CCiCap) contract with NASA, plans for converting SLC-41 into a dual use pad for Atlas V were being designed. At the time, Atlas V was looking to launch both Starliner (then known only as CST-100) and Dream Chaser crew missions from the Cape Canaveral pad. Dream Chaser was shown in the majority of the envisioning, albeit preliminary views of a crew walking across an exposed platform to board their spacecraft. However, a crew “walking the plank” to a spacecraft attached to the pointy end of an Atlas V launch vehicle was never likely to be a real-world scenario Unsurprisingly, those pad designs soon evolved. Renderings and videos created by Dream Chaser’s parents at SNC showed a pad that began to include a Crew Access Arm and a White Room in the envisioning, allowing astronauts to complete their final leg to the spacecraft – following an elevator ride to the top of the pad – via an enclosed structure. Although Dream Chaser lost out on launching NASA astronauts from SLC-41, she is expected to launch cargo missions on the Atlas V. With Starliner effectively beat Dream Chaser to join SpaceX’s Dragon 2 in the honor of launching American astronauts from home soil for the first time since Atlantis’ STS-135 mission, SLC-41 still requires “crew rating”. See Also Starliner/CST-100 Forum L2 Commercial Crew Click here to Join L2 Originally built for the Titan IIIC and subsequently used by the Titan IIIE and Titan IV before being rebuilt for the Atlas between 1999 and 2002, SLC-41 supports all of the Atlas V’s East Coast launches with West Coast launches making use of Space Launch Complex 3E at Vandenberg Air Force Base. Historically, SLC-41 has seen a share of notable satellite launches, including the Helios probe, the Viking probes to Mars, and the Voyager interplanetary and interstellar deep space probes by Titan rockets, as well as the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, New Horizons, Juno, and the Mars Science Laboratory “Curiosity” missions by the Atlas V rocket. Work to convert the pad for its new era of hosting Starliner launches has been ongoing between Atlas V’s bread and butter missions launching an array of spacecraft from her Cape pad. The service tower, designed to provide access to the CST-100 Starliner for pre-launch processing, crew access, and safety egress systems (EES – Emergency Egress System) should the need to evacuate Starliner on the pad occur, was built offsite for transportation to LC-41 in between Atlas V missions. Beginning after the MUOS-3 launch in early 2015, pre-fabricated tiers of the tower were stacked at the pad in April. With all the tiers now assembled – along with the internal structure that includes an elevator – construction at the pad focused on the outboard steel. The final major piece of the tower is the crew access arm, tested at the Sauer Group, Inc.’s yard in Oak Hill, Florida, just north of the Cape Canaveral area. It has been transported to the launch site to be installed on the new structure in the coming days. Currently, media are expected to be invited over the weekend to celebrate its installation. After all, the milestone of installation will complete the major construction of the first new Crew Access Tower to be constructed along Florida’s Space Coast since the Apollo era. The integrated tower is estimated to be complete by mid-October, well before Starliner launches are set to take place in early 2018. Preparations for SLS Launches: While SLC-41 has gained additional structure, KSC’s Pad 39B has seen its complex reduced to a “clean pad”, allowing for the arrival of SLS on the Mobile Launcher. The ML is a complex rolling tower – transported to the pad via the modified Crawler Transporter – sporting an array of umbilicals and connections, most of which will be mated with the rocket and Orion spacecraft inside the Vehicle Assembly Building (VAB) High Bay, before rolling out to the pad. Testing of the numerous hardware elements – that will be installed on the ML – is ongoing at the Launch Equipment Test Facility (LETF). This historic test site is located just south of the Operations and Checkout (O&C) Building at the famous spaceport. The first major umbilical to be tested was the Orion Service Module Umbilical (OSMU) last summer. Over recent weeks, engineers have been preparing for the milestone of testing the Core Stage Forward Skirt Umbilical, or CSFSU. The CSFSU will be a T-0 umbilical requiring Vehicle Assembly Building (VAB) access for mating of the umbilical plate to the SLS rocket. Commodity lines for the CS FS will run through the stabilizer truss of the umbilical arm, with drape commodity lines extending from the arm to CS FS attach location. The umbilical plate will have dimensions of 46 inches by 34 inches. Testing was set to begin last week. However, poor weather moved the start of a test program on the umbilical into this week. Meanwhile, one of the Tail Service Mast units arrived at the LETF on the back of a flatbed truck. The SLS TSMs will use a pneumatic operated system to detach the umbilical plate from SLS, before retracting the umbilical carrier and closing the door to protect the umbilicals and connections from the exhaust of the SLS launch. This is an advance on the Shuttle TSMs, which used a drop weight for the retraction, released via pyrotechnic devices. Planning teams decided the pyro devices shouldn’t be used for SLS, which led to the decision to go to a pneumatic retraction system alternative. The size of the TSM provides a sign of the upgraded needs of the ML, with each device weighing in at 170,000 pounds. The Shuttle LH2 TSM weighed only 120,000 pounds. The LH2 TSM will be tested at Vehicle Motion Simulator -1 (VMS-1), while the LOX TSM is due in next month, and will go on VMS-2. They will spend the next three months or so hooking the devices to LETF services, ahead of testing in November. According to LETF testing notes (L2), a total of nine umbilical devices are currently in various stages of their testing ahead of being installed on the ML. Meanwhile, next door’s Pad 39A is continuing to be prepared for the debut launch of the SpaceX Falcon Heavy, which is expected to take place early in 2017. The former Shuttle launch complex is technically “pad active”, although work is continuing on items such as the hold down points.

Jetstar to ask GE to explain engine breakdown Source: Xinhua   2016-08-09 16:58:46 Xinhua Weibo Facebook Twitter Reddit Diigo Delicious Digg Linkedin MySpace Sina Weibo Kaixin Renren Q-zone Tencent Weibo Sohu Weibo NetEase Weibo SYDNEY, Aug. 9 (Xinhua) -- Australian low-cost airline Jetstar has asked aircraft engine manufacturer General Electric for an explanation after a near-new engine had to be shut down during a mid-air flight from Tokyo to Gold Coast. NewsCorp reported on Tuesday that the GEnx model engine fitted on a Boeing 787 had to be shut down after a warning light appeared indicating oil pressure problems on the flight on Sunday, prompting it to be diverted to Guam. Jetstar spokesman said the aircraft's engine had been installed three months ago to replace an engine of the same model that was only nine months' old. The older engine was repaired and put into another aircraft. The spokesman said it was unusual to have an issue like this so soon into the life of an aircraft engine adding that the airline had sought an explanation from the manufacturer on the matter. "Boeing 787s can fly safely on one engine," a Jetstar spokesman said. "GE (General Electric) has a team which is working with our engineers to understand what occurred," the spokesman said. This is not the first time an airline has been experiencing mid-air engine problems. In April, another 787, operated by Xiamen Airlines, had an engine shut down because of an oil pressure problem. And in February, an Air India 787 also switched off one engine after encountering problems. Despite the problems, Boeing 787s are designed to fly safely on one engine. A spokeswoman for GE declined to comment but said that the company was working with Jetstar on the matter. "We ... expect to know more in the next 24 hours," she told NewsCorp.

NewsCorp reported on Tuesday that the GEnx model engine fitted on a Boeing 787 had to be shut down after a warning light appeared indicating oil pressure problems on the flight on Sunday, prompting it to be diverted to Guam. Jetstar spokesman said the aircraft's engine had been installed three months ago to replace an engine of the same model that was only nine months' old. The older engine was repaired and put into another aircraft. The spokesman said it was unusual to have an issue like this so soon into the life of an aircraft engine adding that the airline had sought an explanation from the manufacturer on the matter. "Boeing 787s can fly safely on one engine," a Jetstar spokesman said. "GE (General Electric) has a team which is working with our engineers to understand what occurred," the spokesman said. This is not the first time an airline has been experiencing mid-air engine problems. In April, another 787, operated by Xiamen Airlines, had an engine shut down because of an oil pressure problem. And in February, an Air India 787 also switched off one engine after encountering problems. Despite the problems, Boeing 787s are designed to fly safely on one engine. A spokeswoman for GE declined to comment but said that the company was working with Jetstar on the matter. "We ... expect to know more in the next 24 hours," she told NewsCorp.

Sydney : MH370 plunged into the ocean at high speed, up to 20,000 feet a minute, reinforcing analysis that the missing Malaysia Airlines jet crashed in the current search zone, a report said Tuesday. The Boeing 777 disappeared on March 8, 2014 en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing with 239 people onboard. An extensive underwater hunt in the southern Indian Ocean has not yet found the crash site, fuelling speculation it may be outside the current search zone, particularly if someone was at the controls at the end of the flight. A manned plane could have been glided down, allowing it to enter the water outside the 120,000 square kilometre (46,000 square mile) area being searched, some experts have suggested. But extensive testing by aircraft manufacturer Boeing and new Australian defence department data analysis both suggest that regardless of the possible actions of one or both of the pilots the jet dived into the ocean at high speed, The Australian reported. Once MH370 ran out of fuel and the engines flamed, it slowed before plunging down towards the water in a series of swoops dropping from 35,000 feet at a rate of between 12,000 feet a minute and 20,000 feet a minute, Boeing said, according to the report. The sharp dive was confirmed by a new data analysis by Australia's defence department involving signals sent automatically between the plane and a satellite, the head of the agency leading the MH370 hunt said. Australian Transport and Safety Bureau chief Greg Hood said this supported the view MH370 "was likely to have crashed in the 120,000 square kilometre (46,000 square mile) area now being searched," the paper said. The area was defined under the ATSB's "most likely" scenario that no-one was at the controls and the plane ran out of fuel. "The Australians leading the search do not doubt that the pilot may well have been responsible for the jet's disappearance but they say critics of the search strategy are wrong to assume that means they are looking in the wrong place," the report added. Malaysian officials said last week that one of the pilots used a home-made flight simulator to plot a very similar course to MH370's presumed final route, but warned this did not prove he deliberately crashed the plane.

Several conspiracy theories surrounding the plane's disappearance have made the rounds over the last two years. The Australian reported, citing experts, that the Boeing 777-200 crashed in the Indian Ocean off Western Australia after running out of fuel. According to the experts, the plane’s left engine flamed out first and then the right went about 15 minutes later. Experts cited simulation tests by Boeing that showed the plane may have slowed and lost lift after it lost power to the engines. The plane’s nose may have dropped and it plunged downward where it may have gathered speed and lifted, and then fell down repeatedly before hitting the ocean. Greg Hood, the chief commissioner of the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB), which is leading the search for the missing plane, told the Australian that the pilot would not have been in control of the plane when it crashed. Hood said that new data also showed that Flight MH370 likely crashed in a 46,332 sq. mile area in a remote part of the southern Indian Ocean, where search crews have been looking for the jet for several months. Related Stories Weather Continues To Complicate MH370 Mission 'We Need To Find The Airplane' The new analysis report comes just a week after Malaysia refuted claims that the plane’s Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah “deliberately flew the plane into the Indian Ocean.” "Yes, he had simulated the flight path, but it is one of thousands of simulations to many parts of the world. We cannot, just based on this, confirm he did it,” Malaysian Transport Minister Liow Tiong Lai said. Flight MH370 went off radar more than two years ago with 239 people on board while on its way from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. A multimillion-dollar search for the missing plane has so far yielded no concrete clues as to what happened to the plane. Last week, Malaysia, China and Australia announced that they will be suspending the underwater search for Flight MH370 unless “credible new information” emerges. A flaperon found last year in the French-controlled Réunion Island in the Indian Ocean has been confirmed to be from the missing plane, following which five other parts this year have been said to be "likely" from the jet.

Imperial Valley News Heart of the Matter Carbon nanotube “stitches” strengthen composites Print Email Details Written by Jennifer Chu Category: Latest News Published: 08 August 2016 Cambridge, Massachusetts - The newest Airbus and Boeing passenger jets flying today are made primarily from advanced composite materials such as carbon fiber reinforced plastic - extremely light, durable materials that reduce the overall weight of the plane by as much as 20 percent compared to aluminum-bodied planes. Such lightweight airframes translate directly to fuel savings, which is a major point in advanced composites’ favor. But composite materials are also surprisingly vulnerable: While aluminum can withstand relatively large impacts before cracking, the many layers in composites can break apart due to relatively small impacts - a drawback that is considered the material’s Achilles’ heel. Now MIT aerospace engineers have found a way to bond composite layers in such a way that the resulting material is substantially stronger and more resistant to damage than other advanced composites. Their results are published this week in the journal Composites Science and Technology. The researchers fastened the layers of composite materials together using carbon nanotubes — atom-thin rolls of carbon that, despite their microscopic stature, are incredibly strong. They embedded tiny “forests” of carbon nanotubes within a glue-like polymer matrix, then pressed the matrix between layers of carbon fiber composites. The nanotubes, resembling tiny, vertically-aligned stitches, worked themselves within the crevices of each composite layer, serving as a scaffold to hold the layers together. In experiments to test the material’s strength, the team found that, compared with existing composite materials, the stitched composites were 30 percent stronger, withstanding greater forces before breaking apart. Roberto Guzman, who led the work as an MIT postdoc in the Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AeroAstro), says the improvement may lead to stronger, lighter airplane parts — particularly those that require nails or bolts, which can crack conventional composites. “More work needs to be done, but we are really positive that this will lead to stronger, lighter planes,” says Guzman, who is now a researcher at the IMDEA Materials Institute, in Spain. “That means a lot of fuel saved, which is great for the environment and for our pockets.” The study’s co-authors include AeroAstro professor Brian Wardle and researchers from the Swedish aerospace and defense company Saab AB. “Size matters” Today’s composite materials are composed of layers, or plies, of horizontal carbon fibers, held together by a polymer glue, which Wardle describes as “a very, very weak, problematic area.” Attempts to strengthen this glue region include Z-pinning and 3-D weaving — methods that involve pinning or weaving bundles of carbon fibers through composite layers, similar to pushing nails through plywood, or thread through fabric. “A stitch or nail is thousands of times bigger than carbon fibers,” Wardle says. “So when you drive them through the composite, you break thousands of carbon fibers and damage the composite.” Carbon nanotubes, by contrast, are about 10 nanometers in diameter — nearly a million times smaller than the carbon fibers. “Size matters, because we’re able to put these nanotubes in without disturbing the larger carbon fibers, and that’s what maintains the composite’s strength,” Wardle says. “What helps us enhance strength is that carbon nanotubes have 1,000 times more surface area than carbon fibers, which lets them bond better with the polymer matrix.” Stacking up the competition Guzman and Wardle came up with a technique to integrate a scaffold of carbon nanotubes within the polymer glue. They first grew a forest of vertically-aligned carbon nanotubes, following a procedure that Wardle’s group previously developed. They then transferred the forest onto a sticky, uncured composite layer and repeated the process to generate a stack of 16 composite plies — a typical composite laminate makeup — with carbon nanotubes glued between each layer. To test the material’s strength, the team performed a tension-bearing test — a standard test used to size aerospace parts — where the researchers put a bolt through a hole in the composite, then ripped it out. While existing composites typically break under such tension, the team found the stitched composites were stronger, able to withstand 30 percent more force before cracking. The researchers also performed an open-hole compression test, applying force to squeeze the bolt hole shut. In that case, the stitched composite withstood 14 percent more force before breaking, compared to existing composites. “The strength enhancements suggest this material will be more resistant to any type of damaging events or features,” Wardle says. “And since the majority of the newest planes are more than 50 percent composite by weight, improving these state-of-the art composites has very positive implications for aircraft structural performance.” Stephen Tsai, emeritus professor of aeronautics and astronautics at Stanford University, says advanced composites are unmatched in their ability to reduce fuel costs, and therefore, airplane emissions. “With their intrinsically light weight, there is nothing on the horizon that can compete with composite materials to reduce pollution for commercial and military aircraft,” says Tsai, who did not contribute to the study. But he says the aerospace industry has refrained from wider use of these materials, primarily because of a “lack of confidence in [the materials’] damage tolerance.

The Boeing F/A-18 Super Hornet and the Lockheed Martin F-35A Lightning II will be featured, both top contenders to replace the Royal Canadian Air Force's aging fighter jets. The airshow will mark the first time the F-35 has been on display in Canada. Two F-35s will be in town, with one on public display. "We are always thrilled to connect people with airplanes, and certainly we are ecstatic to have the F-35A make its Canadian debut right here," said airshow president Jim Reith. The F-35A has been the topic of much political debate in Canada, with the current Liberal government not yet committing to a previous Conservative government plan to replace its fleet of CF-18s by 2025 with the expensive Lockheed Martin planes. The U.S. Air Force announced on Aug. 2 that it now considers the F-35 ready for combat. It will also be the first time F/A-18 Super Hornets will be flown by Boeing test pilots in Canada. The planes are being leased by Boeing from the U.S. Air Force. These features would not be possible without a unique partnership with AIAC Pacific, the organization that produces the annual Aerospace Defense & Security Expo, which runs this Thursday and Friday. "We're positioning ourselves to be literally the only place in Canada with a major airshow with a trade conference right on the airfield and the ability to fly and display aircraft," said Reith. "That doesn't happen anywhere else in Canada and to be honest, it really doesn't happen anywhere else in North America." The airshow and trade show partnership model has been successful abroad, according to Reith, who pointed to the Farnborough Airshow in Hampshire, England, as well as shows in Paris, Singapore and Dubai. Reith points out that there are several more fighter jets rounding out the 'Fightertown' line-up, including two McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagles, "which is still one of the the greatest aircraft ever built [it was] never bested in aerial combat."

自由電子報 | 影音娛樂 | 好康報報 | 自由部落 ‧Business Home Front Page Taiwan News Business Editorials Sports World News Features Bilingual Pages Home / Business Tue, Aug 09, 2016 - Page 10　News List Print Mail Facebook Twitter plurk funp UK fraud office has opened criminal bribery investigation, Airbus says Bloomberg An Airbus A-380 is pictured in flight at the Farnborough Airshow, in Farnborough, England, on 11 July. Photo: EPA Airbus Group SE said the UK Serious Fraud Office has opened a criminal investigation into allegations of fraud, bribery and corruption relating to some of its third-party consultants. The Toulouse, France-based planemaker said in a statement on Sunday that it is cooperating with investigators probing its civil aviation business. Airbus had flagged to UK regulators and the European Export Credit Agencies earlier this year “misstatements and omissions” involving the outside contractors in some export financing applications, which it found through an internal probe. The credit agencies, including UK Export Finance, have suspended some of the backstop financing that Airbus uses to help sell commercial aircraft since the first revelations made four months ago. Airbus said in a July 27 statement that a process for re-establishing export credit “has been agreed and is ongoing.” Until the financing is restored, Airbus and rival Boeing Co face the challenge of navigating an uncertain market with limited government assistance. Chicago-based Boeing has been unable to tap trade financing because a congressional impasse has left the US Export-Import bank with too few directors to approve deals. Jefferies Equity Research estimates that export-credit agencies last year provided 7 percent of financing for Airbus plane deliveries, compared with 45 percent from leasing companies and 40 percent from airlines themselves. The Airbus investigation adds to the scrutiny of the role played by cross-border intermediaries. Monaco-based Unaoil SAM, which served as a go-between for companies and officials in the Middle East, Africa and former Soviet countries, was searched by authorities earlier this year amid allegations of corruption. “This will have some negative impact,” said Shukor Yusof, founder of aviation consulting firm Endau Analytics in Malaysia. “Third-party consultants or intermediaries have often caused worries. The business of aircraft sale is so intense and competitive that there are people trying many avenues.” Airbus said in the July 27 filing that it is undertaking a sweeping review involving “legal, investigative, and forensic accounting” of consultants and other third parties used to support sales. The European planemaker said it is also using greater due diligence to screen potential contractors. “The group cannot exclude that the comprehensive review and these enhancements of its controls and practices lead to additional commercial disputes or other consequences in the future,” the filing said.

He posed for a picture with the Rolling Stones in 1964 and had them sign it in 1999. Bob Harris twice beat cancer, wrote a book on rock and roll, and once flew a Stearman biplane. But he never did this. Sunday, a month after his 86th birthday, Harris of Southgate leapt from an airplane. He fell 18,000 feet and parachuted safely to a grassy runway at the Napoleon Airport. "I love all of you," he said, raising his arms and greeting a group of cheering supporters who had waited for hours to see their patriarch do what many of them, far younger and a bit spryer, dared not do. Bob Harris, 86, reacts to skydiving experience They scoured the sky and held their phones in the air as Harris' parachute came into view, growing from a tiny blue and white speck. "Hey, all of you guys need to jump out of a plane. Let me tell you. That's almost as good as having a baby," Harris shouted. Harris, who proudly declares himself the oldest Stones fan, decided to skydive in honor of Mick Jagger, an expecting father at 73. He did it too for his family. Harris has six children, 19 grandchildren, 30 great grandchildren and five great, great grandchildren. All five generations, sporting coordinating T-shirts, were represented Sunday at the dropzone. Five relatives from four generations and Harris' oldest friend, 84-year-old Robert Kruckow, accompanied Harris in his jump, featured by TV news stations in Detroit and Toledo, facts that thrilled Harris, clearly reveling in the attention. "Between you and me, I'll never get that close to heaven again," Harris said as he waited for his name to be called at the busy Skydive Tecumseh facility, relocated in 2015 to Napoleon. The owner, Franz Gerschwiler, said age 92 was oldest jumper he knew, but elderly customers are rare. He marveled Sunday at Harris' massive contingent, a collection of about 50 people, mostly from the Detroit area. "I've lived one hell of a life," said Harris, who is eager to tell tales, some believable – some not. His family is accustomed to his outlandish stories about "Charlie the Tuna" or "Mr. Bear," said his granddaughter Heather Sanders, 39, of Dearborn Heights. "Have you seen the movie 'Big Fish?' That was my grandpa." Harris was raised by a single, adoptive mother who told him she found him in a basket in New York. "I lived down the street from where (gangster John) Dillinger was killed." They moved to Chicago and then Michigan when he was about 11. Harris wasn't too keen on school and he dropped out at 14. He says he lied about his age to join the Merchant Marines and later, the Navy Reserves and the U.S. Army. He went to Japan as part of the occupational forces at the close of World War II. He tried factory work, but "couldn't stand it," and made his living creating newspapers for teenagers. He worked in the entertainment business as a manager and promoter and ran a now-demolished theater on Michigan Avenue in Detroit. "We had $1 movies on weekends and rock concerts every Tuesday night." Iggy and the Stooges played there, said Harris, who is quick to drop names of the stars he encountered. He mentioned Elvis Presley, Wayne Newton, Sonny and Cher, Kenny Rogers, The Supremes and countless others. He co-wrote a book, "Motor City Rock and Roll: The 1960s and 1970s," which has Harris and the Rolling Stones on its cover, and boasts of a collection of signed photographs he said proves his affiliations. They once covered the walls of his house. How has he done it? "He just pushes his way into things," said his 63-year-old son Tony Harris of Redford, who begrudgingly agreed to jump Sunday in honor of his father. "He's not budging until he sells you a vacuum cleaner." Bob Harris gave singer Stevie Wonder a ride before he was a star and five years later, when Harris was involved in a Motown review, Wonder recognized him and invited him to a party. Motown great Smokey Robinson, Harris says, had already invited him. This is what it is like to talk to Harris. Sit down to an afternoon conversation. "By breakfast tomorrow, I'd still be talking," he said as he sat with Kruckow, a motorcycle rider in yellow-tinted aviator glasses who worked as a test driver at Ford. Kruckow has known Harris since the 1950s; Harris introduced him to his wife. "He does crazy things all the time," Kruckow said then mentioned Harris' initial plan to skydive into Comerica Park for a Detroit Rolling Stones concert –Sunday's itinerary proved a tad more doable. Kruckow, Harris says, is his only friend of the same age range. He doesn't consider himself a senior citizen. "I don't deal with old people." Harris is agile for an octogenarian – and sharp. He fought off colon and prostate cancer and now walks the stairs to his ninth-floor apartment, where, divorced, he lives alone. For more than 30 years, he has been creating and circulating a small tabloid, the sort of newspaper that sits in the entrance of a grocery store. "I don't sit home. I don't do television. I'm gone. I'm doing something." He scoffs at retirement and plans to live long enough to "make everyone mad." Would he skydive again? "I think I will do this again and get some more of my family to jump with me," he said, razzing those who opted to stay on the ground. He then turned to a cluster of his grandchildren. "Hey kids, remember this: When you get my age don't jump out of a plane. Jump when you get 20 years old. Jump. It's fun. You'll love it, all of you, like I love you."

X UK fraud office opens criminal investigation into Airbus French-based aircraft manufacturer faces allegations relating to external consultants Mon, Aug 8, 2016, 06:27 Updated: Mon, Aug 8, 2016, 06:28 Airbus said it was co-operating with investigators probing its civil aviation business.

The Australian flag carrier will receive its first Boeing 787 – also known as the Dreamliner – in 2017, but will announce new routes for the plane later this year. Sales of the A380 have been lacklustre, forcing Airbus to cut production of the jumbo Credit: GETTY Were the London-Perth service given the go-ahead, it would rival the current longest flight in the world, the Emirates Dubai to Auckland service, which clocks in at 8,819 miles and takes 17 hours and 15 minutes. Qantas also announced that it would be deferring delivery of the remaining eight orders it has for the Airbus A380, dealing another blow for the superjumbo.   The world's longest flights The world’s largest passenger plane is a firm favourite amongst travellers, but airline demand for the jet has failed to meet expectations.   Boeing’s 787 and Airbus’s A380 have been competing for control of the skies for the best part of a decade. But many airlines are now moving towards smaller, more fuel-efficient twin-engine jets, like the 787, and away from larger four-engine models like the A380. Airbus has therefore been forced to scale back production of the superjumbo: it will make just 12 of the jets in 2018 compared with 27 in 2015.   Despite the lacklustre sales, Airbus remains bullish about the future of the plane, which has been reconfigured to squeeze 11 people on each row. Watch | Five top tips to survive a long-haul flight 02:03 “The A380 is here to stay,” Airbus’s Robert Gage told Telegraph Travel. “The aircraft is in a class of its own with no competitor’s derivative coming anywhere close. “It is a firm favourite with passengers for its unmatched comfort… and airlines benefit from the extra revenue potential on the world’s busiest routes.” Emirates is the largest operator of the A380 – with 75 of the jets in service and another 67 on order – while Lufthansa, British Airways and Air France are amongst the other airlines using the double-decker jumbo. Watch | Watch: Amazing moment A380 flies under hovering helicopter 00:59 Overall sales of the A380, however, have fallen short of what Airbus expected.  Boeing has also been affected by the trend towards smaller jets: last month it sounded the death knell for the iconic 747, which has been losing money for the American company.  “If we are unable to obtain sufficient orders and/or market, production and other risks cannot be mitigated, we could record additional losses that may be material, and it is reasonably possible that we could decide to end production of the 747," said a spokesperson.

Mr Trump included a call for a 15% corporate rate in a Detroit speech where he outlined other tax and economic reforms. Business groups have long said their members are hurt because US companies pay the most federal income tax — a 35% rate, though the effective rate is often lower — among the 35 countries in the OECD. “The fact that he is pushing for a 15% corporate tax rate is definitely a positive,” said Dorothy Coleman, vice-president of tax and domestic economic policy for the National Association of Manufacturers. READ NEXT Firms lose Luas court appeal “Tax reform is really one of the important goals that we have.” The Rate Coalition, which lists Boeing, Ford, and Wal-Mart among corporate supporters, said it will not endorse all aspects of Mr Trump’s plan but that the tax proposal is a “huge step in the right direction and we urge other candidates in the race to follow his lead”. Mr Trump also called for a 10% levy on overseas cash that companies have been unwilling to bring home because of high US taxes. For small businesses, the proposal was a “home run”, said Juanita Duggan, chief executive of the National Federation of Independent Business. It would provide the same 15% rate for companies no matter their size, freeing up funds to invest back into family businesses, she said. The US last adjusted its corporate tax in 1993 when it was pushed up by a percentage point to 35%, said Alan Cole, an economist with the Tax Foundation’s Center for Federal Tax Policy. Under a 1986 tax bill, the rate was phased down to 34% from 46%. Countries around the world have been ratcheting down their tax rate steadily to become more competitive, said Mr Cole. The average corporate tax rate when including state levies and weighted by the size of economy has declined to about 29% from 36% in 2003. The US corporate tax when including state levies is about 39%, according to the OECD. The US Chamber of Commerce did not issue a statement on the Trump speech and referred questions to a video that calls for lower rates and a globally competitive system. The manufacturers association still wants to see more particulars on Mr Trump’s plan, as well as more incentive for capital spending and research and development, said Mr Coleman, adding: “The devil is in the details on this.” READ MORE Visit the section home page here READ NEXT Firms lose Luas court appeal KEYWORDS business, finance, economy, us, donald trump, corporate tax, tax © Irish Examiner Ltd.

Quinlan InsideSources.com Aug 9, 2016 A historically slow recovery with weak economic growth has created enough economic angst to fuel multiple populist, outsider campaigns this election season. At least one apparent bright spot in the economy, however, is the near-record high profits being recorded by U.S. corporations, which in turn has sent the stock market to record highs.   But there’s reason to question even that, as a growing share of corporate profits are being derived from lobbying and favorable regulations — cronyism — instead of productive contributions to the economy.  According to research recently reported in Harvard Business Review by economist James Bessen, “since 2000, political activity and regulation account for a surprisingly large share of the increase” in corporate valuations and profits. Corporations have always been able to game the system and benefit from special carve-outs from both politicians and regulators, but the problem seems to be getting worse.  Consider iconic modern industrialist Elon Musk. While generally viewed as a visionary tech entrepreneur, Musk has also mastered the art of using government to benefit his corporate interests.  The PayPal co-founder has a variety of ventures in emerging sectors, including solar energy collection, electrical vehicle production, and space exploration. It’s an inspiring list, but in each field he has benefited heavily from taxpayer support. In total his three companies have received an estimated $4.9 billion in subsidies, according to the Los Angeles Times, plus billions more in government contracts.  The latest example involves his SpaceX, which made headlines earlier this year for successfully landing one of its Falcon 9 rockets at sea. A very respectable achievement, but less commendable is the backroom Washington dealing on the company’s behalf that could  pave the way for SpaceX to secure lucrative defense contracts without competition. At the behest of Sen. John McCain, this year’s National Defense Authorization Act includes an amendment worth billions for SpaceX and Musk.  Currently a joint venture between Lockheed Martin and Boeing called the United Launch Alliance produces the rockets used for launching defense satellites into orbit. ULA buys the engines for their rockets from Russia, which McCain and Musk — who previously sued over the issue — argue is reason to restrict ULA from fulfilling the remainder of its contract.  The Russian engines are widely acknowledged as reliable, and were even created at the behest of the United States as it sought to keep Russian scientists employed in respectable fields instead of selling secrets to rogue nations. Rockets using domestic alternatives are currently either too expensive or, in the case of SpaceX, not yet capable of carrying sufficient loads into orbit.  Most important, the director of National Intelligence and top military officials have testified that continuing to use rockets from ULA, even with Russian engines, best serves our national security interests until domestically sourced alternatives are ready for use.  Ultimately, McCain was forced to compromise on his demands to end immediately procurement of ULA rockets and instead set a cut-off date of 2022. Maybe SpaceX will be ready to step in at that time with reliable rockets powered by domestically built engines, or maybe it won’t. But there’s no legitimate reason for Congress to limit its options at this time except as part of a crony deal paving the way for Musk alone to bid on supplying the rockets. The better approach would be to keep as many eligible to compete as possible and let the best bidder win.  McCain’s amendment is just one of many benefits Musk has managed to wrangle for his companies. Tesla not only got a federal loan guarantee to manufacture its electrical vehicles but purchases are subsidized through tax credits. SolarCity gets a similar combination of subsidies and customer tax credits for its solar panels.  SpaceX even got taxpayer backed loans from the cronyism-enabling Export-Import Bank. Ex-Im’s chairman justified the support with the perplexing claim that SpaceX is a “small business” despite employing 4,000 people. Last year’s purchase of a 10 percent stake in SpaceX by Google and Fidelity also shows it has no problem raising capital on its own without taxpayer support.  None of this is to say that Musk has made no legitimate economic contributions, but rather that his companies have profited at least in part thanks to the largess of politicians, and not due to market forces alone. At a time when wages for most of the very taxpayers funding those handouts remain stagnant, that's a tough pill to swallow.  Andrew F. Quinlan is the co-founder and president of the Center for Freedom and Prosperity, which promotes free-market ideas. He wrote this for InsideSources.com.     Tags Spacex John Mccain Elon Musk Andrew F.

The lawsuits, filed Aug. 9 in different federal courts, accuse the universities of charging excessive record-keeping and administrative fees in connection with their retirement plans for faculty members. The complaints raise a novel challenge to the way the retirement plans are managed — namely, that the plans included too many duplicative and unnecessary investment options, which caused investors to suffer from “decision paralysis” and interfered with the ability of plan fiduciaries to negotiate lower fees. Lawsuits over retirement plan fees have come at a rapid-fire pace since 2015, when the U.S. Supreme Court affirmed the duty of plan fiduciaries to monitor investments on an ongoing basis and largely eliminated a key defense to these types of lawsuits. That year also saw several high-profile settlements in plan fee cases brought by Schlichter, including a $57 million deal with Boeing Co., a $62 million settlement with Lockheed Martin Corp. and a $32 million agreement with Novant Health Inc. Allegations. The lawsuits take issue with the number of investment options offered in each university’s retirement plans — which allegedly ranged between 84 and 340, with multiple options in each asset class. According to the complaints, a reasonable number of investment options for a large retirement plan is closer to 15. “Defendant provided a dizzying array of duplicative funds in the same investment style, thereby losing the bargaining power associated with offering a single option in each investment style, which significantly reduces investment fees, and causing ‘decision paralysis’ for participants,” the employees suing NYU alleged in their complaint. The lawsuits challenge other aspects of the retirement plans, including: the use of higher-fee retail share classes when lower-fee options were allegedly available; annual record-keeping fees that allegedly ranged from $170 to $340 per participant; and the retention of historically underperforming investment funds. In the cases against Yale and NYU, employees attack the decisions to use multiple record keepers, instead of a single record keeper that they say could have provided lower fees. The lawsuit against MIT takes aim at the university’s relationship with Boston-based Fidelity Investments, which served as the plan’s record keeper and provided many of the plan’s investment options. In particular, the lawsuit accuses MIT of giving its business to Fidelity without conducting regular competitive bidding processes. The employees say this stemmed from the university’s personal ties with Fidelity and its chief executive officer, Abigail Johnson, who has served on MIT’s board of trustees since 2007. According to the complaints, each university controls more than $3 billion in retirement plan assets for the benefit of thousands of plan participants. University Reaction. NYU spokesman John Beckman told Bloomberg BNA in an Aug. 9 e-mail that the university expects to prevail in the lawsuit filed against it. “NYU only first saw the papers a very short while ago this morning, so we cannot comment at length,” Beckman said. “But it seems worth noting that, first, NYU’s plans have comparatively low fees; second, decisions about our retirement plan choices are influenced by feedback from our faculty and other employees; and, third, that the named plaintiffs in this case notably include several faculty members who recently lost unrelated court cases they brought against NYU.” “NYU takes seriously the welfare of our faculty and employees — including a dignified retirement — and the retirement plans offered to them are chosen and administered carefully and prudently,” Beckman continued. “We will litigate this case vigorously and expect to prevail.” Kimberly Allen, director of media relations for MIT, declined Bloomberg BNA’s request for comment on the lawsuit, citing a general policy against discussing pending litigation. Yale didn’t immediately respond to Bloomberg BNA’s inquiries. The cases are: Vellali v. Yale Univ., D. Conn., No. 3:16-cv-01345, complaint filed 8/9/16; Sacerdote v. N.Y. Univ., S.D.N.Y., No. 1:16-cv-06284, complaint filed 8/9/16; and Tracey v. Mass. Inst. of Tech., D. Mass., No. 1:16-cv-11620-NMG, complaint filed 8/9/16.

My Midwestern GI tract performed admirably well, save for one surreal moment on an overnight, long-haul, toilet-less sleeper bus that found me hanging my rear out the window performing my first “flying toilet.” Only problem was, the bag was too small for the task at hand, leaving me to assault the roadside (and, it turned out, the side of the bus) at god knows how many kilometers per hour. To my everlasting horror, I realized at the next rest stop that the occupant below me was fast asleep next to his open window. A flying toilet would have been much more difficult for this reader: I started feeling sick six hours before my flight was scheduled to leave Nairobi, but I convinced myself it was nothing serious. A half hour or so into the flight, I was hit with the worst-imaginable stomach cramps. A cramp would hit, and I’d curl up in a ball for a few seconds of relief. Then another cramp would hit, and I’d stretch as much as I could for a few seconds of relief, etc., etc. Continue Reading The steward saw I was in distress (I was lying on the floor by then) and announced in business class that there was a sick person in coach who needed more room and asked for a volunteer to trade seats. Miracle! A kind person swapped his/her large, comfortable, expensive seat for my tiny one. I don’t know how I would have survived the 12-hour flight to London if I hadn’t been able to stretch out. I was too out of it to ask who the person was, but I am eternally grateful for his/her compassion. I had an 18-hour layover in London, where the bedrest revived me enough to make it to Chicago and finally home to Portland, where I was diagnosed with typhoid fever.   Courtney had a helluva time meeting new family: In 2007 I was studying in Europe for graduate school. I had about a month off around Christmas to do whatever I please. My mom is from Germany originally and I, at 26, had never met my grandpa, aunts, and uncles. So when I randomly called my grandpa asking if I could visit for Christmas, I got more than an enthusiastic yes. As I was leaving Amsterdam to head to Munich, a snowstorm invaded and I missed my connecting flight in Copenhagen. But I was quickly booked on the next flight out to Munich, although my luggage didn’t make it. About an hour before landing the pilot made an announcement that the wheels were frozen in the aircraft and we were unable to land. We were descending and you could visibly feel the wheels try to force themselves out. The pilot, however, insisted we would make the landing in the second attempt. WOMP!—that's the sound the landing gear made as it sadly failed at trying to come out the second time. Whoosh!—the plane takes off again midair while I notice the mother to my right reading the emergency evacuation to her children. Then the pilot informs us it’s just too cold and we’re going to have to land in Stuttgart. We do. But then the whole plane has to board a bus and trek to Munich for four hours. I can’t call my grandpa—who, remind you, I am meeting for the first time—so I borrow a random phone to let him know what’s going on. In the end, I make it to Munich at 5am to a more-than-happy-to-meet-me grandpa. Talk about making a great first impression! But my luggage didn’t for another three days. Not as awkward as this first visit to meet German relatives: Here’s one last reader, Nicole, who ends on an uplifting note: I left town on a whim. No planning, no expectations—and most importantly, as always—no traveling companion. Just me, my thoughts, my desires, and my money. On Thursday afternoon during my lunch hour, I booked a room downtown in Montreal, just off Saint Catherine. On Friday after work, I headed north out of Vermont. Immediately upon my arrival, I noticed a wild party in the center square, Place Émilie-Gamelin. House music, flashing lights, half-dressed men in leather—Holy stroke of luck! Fierté Montréal! Gay Pride weekend! Just need to drop off my bags! A block to the hotel, and … The front desk attendant spoke only French. We flung incomprehensible words at each other until we landed on one we both understood: “Reservation?” “Yes! Yes, I have a reservation!” I replied. “Nom de famille?” she asked. I showed her my credit card to display my name. She looked at me and shook her head. “Un moment,” she said as she picked up the telephone. She spoke a few sentences in French to the person on the other line, and then handed me the phone. “Hello?” “Nicola?” said the masculine voice on the other line. “Yes?” “Sorry. We did not think you were coming. We cancel your reservation.” “What? Cancelled? WHY?” “Check-in is 3.” “So it’s MANDATORY check in at 3.” “Sorry, cancelled. If you would like to rebook, it’s $390.” “$390? My original reservation was for $265.” “Yes, but now this is late booking. Price increased.” I was decidedly irritated. But honestly, what could I do? I was in another country, it was Pride weekend, and I had no internet or cell phone. “Fine. $390.” “And you need to pay cash.” “Cash? I don’t HAVE cash. I only have a credit card on me. I barely just arrived in the country.” “You can use the cash machine to take money,” he said. “If you want to use credit card, there is an additional 10%, so it will be $429.” “Ok, no. Cash it is. I just need to find an ATM.” I walked a block away, found an ATM, withdrew $500, and returned to the hotel. “$395.” “$395? You just told me $390.” “$5 charge for the room key.” “I am alone, I don’t need an extra room key.” “Each key is $5.” “So the room comes with ZERO room keys? How would I get into the room I paid for without the key?” She shrugged her shoulders, “Sorry. No English.” Frustrated, I paid the $395, took the key and headed to my room. I put my bags down. The room was, not unsurprisingly, unkempt. Ok. Scam or not, I have no recourse for action. I have two choices here, and justice AIN’T one of them: So I can either let this ruin my trip, OR I can shake it off and just roll with it. “I choose the latter,” I thought. Many people would have argued persistently. Maybe they’d have won the room at the lower charge. Maybe not. Maybe they’d have told the front desk to get lost and tried to find another hotel. Maybe they’d have ended up spending even more money. Maybe they’d have just driven right back home. But the frustration and anger would settle on them and envelope them. And in that moment, I realized how lucky I actually am to be a person who CAN choose to shake things off. I CAN choose to be happy. And even in unjustified defeat, ultimately the ability to choose happiness is the greater reward in life. Chris Bodenner 5:15 PM / August 5, 2016 'The Interstates Turned Into a Skating Rink' A reader writes: In 1998 I drove from Austin to southern Illinois in my ‘89 Dodge Ramcharger truck. I started running into freezing rain outside of Dallas, going over Ray Hubbard Reservoir, and decided to keep going. Rather than getting better, it got worse—all the way through Texarkana and beyond. The interstates turned into a skating rink and still I kept going. The drive usually takes 15 hours, but by the time I made it 15 hours, I was only in central Arkansas. Traffic was going by at a crawl when a commercial truck passed everyone in the left lane at 35-40 mph, left the highway, and went nose-first—hard—into the median’s ravine. I stopped to check on the two guys in the truck, and one had hit his chest on the steering wheel and was not in good shape, shocky, and coughing blood. Of course nobody had cell phones, and nobody else stopped to help but me. Via sign language, I was finally able to get someone to call the state police as they drove by. The temps were in the teens and the wind was blowing at 30 mph, so I got the two guys in my truck, blasted the heater, and kept the one guy talking so he wouldn’t go unconscious. State troopers showed up, I had to fill out a statement, and I immediately went looking for a motel before they all filled up with other refugees from I-40. I stayed in a motel that wasn’t much more than a set of prefabs: a bed, a TV, a bathroom, a radio and some paneling. By that point, it was the best motel I had ever seen. The next day, when I got going again, there was a big rig in the median about every five miles. Worst driving conditions I ever traveled in.

Chris Bodenner 1:53 PM / August 4, 2016 Hug-Mugged in Ecuador A reader had a night in the capital city he’ll never forget: Back in 2008, after completing college, I went on a backpacking trip through South America. Best time I ever had. But it didn’t end well. I was in Quito, Ecuador, and I returned late to my youth hostel after getting lost. I’m a rather huge fellow, so I wasn’t much nervous about it. While standing outside the place waiting for the receptionist to wake up, two ladies approached me—and wrapped themselves around me. They did so not because of my immense allure, but rather to pickpocket me. After I felt my phone leave my pocket, I caught a hold of one of the señoras demanding it back. She took out a can of pepper spray and gave me a long extended blast to my face. So, I lost my phone. And my eyes were melting. I inhaled quite a bit of the spray, so my airway was burning. I was screaming. It didn’t end there. While stumbling around screaming and crying, I tripped over something and broke my ankle. And to cap it all, I had an allergic reaction and spent some time in a not-so-lovely hospital. As a result, I missed my flight home. And upon coming back, I discovered that my insurance claim was denied. My family still thought I was the one at fault. I still love Ecuador though. Been there twice since. Have you ever been mugged on vacation? Drop us a note and we’ll post. Update from Chris, whose terrible travel experience ended up being the best thing ever: Continue Reading I was traveling through Europe, with a plan to hang in Sevilla for a few years, or until the military junta in Burma collapsed under the strain of international sanctions and the Nobel Peach Prize that had just been awarded to Aung San Suu Kyi (this was 1991). I decided to stop in Barcelona for a few days en route to Sevilla, so I could get a sense of the city before moving on. My first night there, I was sitting on a bench on las Ramblas, watching people go by, when a guy tapped me on the shoulder and asked me if I knew where the statue of Columbus was. As it turned out, it was probably the only site I’d seen, so I pointed out where it was. Of course, while doing this, his accomplice was making off with my bag, which contained my passport and a journal I’d been keeping for several years while traveling. Shit. Next day, I went to the consulate to apply for a new passport, which I was told would take about a week. Since I’d be stuck in Barcelona for a week, I decided to call a guy whom I’d met in the Copper Canyon of Mexico several years earlier. We’d only hung out for an afternoon, but he’d given me his sister’s phone number and told me to give her a ring if I was ever in Barcelona, as she’d know where he was. I called and explained as best I could that I knew Marcos. She said, “He’s right here, hold on.” Long story short, Marcos took it upon himself to share all the best parts of Barcelona with me: his friends, his favorite spots, hikes in the Pyrenees. By the time my new passport arrived, someone had offered me a job, someone else rented me a room in his flat, and I had met a few women whom I definitely wanted to know better ... Twenty-five years later, I’m still based in Barcelona and am grateful to those thieves. Chris Bodenner 10:45 AM / August 3, 2016 Flying Into Teguci-Gulp-a Reader Adam recalls his worst travel experience: I was going back to Honduras after my honeymoon. I had a connecting flight in Miami. I went to get my bags to get through customs. They hadn’t made it yet. I couldn’t miss my flight, so off I went. Flying into Tegucigalpa was frightening, to say the least. We were all over the sky. I later found out it’s one of the worst airports to fly into. We landed safely on the ground once the pilot figured out how to pull this off. Once at the airport I came to the realization that my bags had been kept in Miami. Everything I bought on the honeymoon was lost. Here’s a bit more about Tegucigalpa’s Toncontin Airport, according to a Popular Mechanics list of the 10 most dangerous airports in the world: Aircraft have to skirt around the mountains of the interior highlands to land in a valley 3,294 feet above sea level. On approach, airliners as big as Boeing 757s make a 45-degree bank to effectively reach the 7000-foot runway with well above average rates of descent. Winds require pilots to compensate while hustling their aircraft in a zig-zag path over the terrain. Departures require high rates of climb to clear the nearby peaks. And the very worst airport to fly into? Conde Nast Traveler says it’s the one in Lukla, Nepal. That airport is featured several times in this long compilation of dicey landings: Have you ever had a harrowing landing, or an emergency situation on a plane? Drop us a note and we’ll post. *** Continue Reading Update from Paul Blackburn, who sends a great photo flying above Guatemala: Attached is a photo I took while on a medical transport in a Lear Jet Model 35, flown by REVA, an air ambulance/transport company based out of Ft. Lauderdale, Florida, and our branch base in Phoenix, Arizona. I was the physician on the flight, and we were banking onto final approach to the primary airport in Guatemala City, Guatemala. We were between a lower level of clouds and a higher scud layer of clouds. As we banked, I noted what I thought to be a mountain protruding through the clouds. On closer inspection, one can see that the “mountain” I briefly saw was actually a volcano, actively emitting steam and/or ash (this is apparently its usual baseline status): Chris Bodenner 6:00 PM / August 1, 2016 When Bad Weather Drowns a Business Deal Reader Greg recalls a terrible, horrible, no good, very bad work trip: Back in 1999 I’m in Zurich trying to get to Brussels for an extremely important seminar that I, as a self-employed consultant, had arranged with a Fortune 500 client. It’s my introduction to their senior management from all over Europe. A huge potential contract is in the balance. Gulp. It’s mid-August and I’m delayed three hours in a sweltering airport then two hours on a sweltering plane waiting on the tarmac for air travel in Western Europe to get over afternoon thunderstorms. I eventually fly to Amsterdam, then I’m driven to Brussels, in the heat and rain, in a full mid-size Mercedes, me middle front. Terrifying. No sleep possible. I arrived in a Brussels hotel at 4:30am. No reservation in my name. No mention of the company I was there for. No normal rooms. I rented an extended-stay suite (very nice) for 90 minutes—enough time to shower, change, and stare at the wall, thinking WTF. No one from the company is at breakfast. I don’t have anyone’s cell phone numbers. At 9am I finally contact a person in the Brussels office. “Oh, two days ago we moved the meetings to a hotel by the airport. Didn’t anyone tell you?" It was supposed to start at 8am. I arrived just after 10am, introduced myself, and started my spiel. I had to finish by noon, but my head was spinning so fast and I kept wanting to faint, so I had to lose another 15 minutes for breaks. Europe was not impressed. I was able to keep my existing work for them going, but I lost out on the huge contract. Ever have a work trip from hell? Drop us a note. Chris Bodenner 1:15 PM / August 1, 2016 'Oysters Are Still the Only Food I Won’t Eat' A reader tries to recall his worst travel experience: Let’s see, the 153AM out of Grand Central can be pretty lively, as can the first train in the morning on Sunday. Taking an overnight train in Vietnam was overrated, as it was dirty, uncomfortable, and sized for Vietnamese people. I’ve had my share of cancellations and so on, including get stuck in Denver overnight a few times, but that’s nothing unusual. My worst experience though, was flying from LA to Chicago when everyone on the plane got food poisoning, which incapacitated the pilots. It forced a fighter pilot turned taxi driver to conquer his fear of flying and save everyone on the plane. Surely he can’t be serious. This reader gets real: It’s about two weeks after 9/11 and I had been saving up for a year to travel through SE Asia to visit a friend who was working for a NGO in [Burma’s capital of] Yangon. Despite the security concerns over terrorism, I had already cleared off time at work, I was broke, and there was NO WAY I was canceling this trip. As expected, there are no “formal” travel restrictions in place, but the airports/border control are making damn sure that it’s really, really hard to travel. Essentially, it’s just a complete cluster and I’m already regretting my decision to save a little cash by flying out of Vancouver, BC instead of Seattle. Not only do I have trouble at the [Canadian border crossing in Blaine, Washington,] because the crappy Sanford & Son bus that picked us up from the sketchy part of downtown was over four hours late, but the (usually affable) Canadian agents are not happy with the quality of passengers on our bus. Many, many hours later (and a forfeited hotel room I secured for the previous evening), I made my way to the airport because it was too late to try to get a few hours of sleep. Surprisingly, I’m on a great flight to Hong Kong with no issues! Continue Reading Then I hopped a connection to Bangkok, where I would have to wait until the following morning for my flight to Yangon. Bangkok has a shiny new airport now, but in 2001, Don Mueang really wasn’t somewhere one would choose to spend time on purpose. There’s an on-site “hotel” so I figured I’d just stay there. Between the fighting/screaming from the couple in the next room (paper-thin walls), the random men who kept trying to ram their way into my room (the door barely locked), and the non-functioning lights (only light bulb in the room, about 20 watts), I may as well have just chained my bag to a chair and slept on the airport floor because I didn’t sleep a wink. I had a great time while I was in Burma (a scary-as-hell flight on Yangon Airways notwithstanding), but on the way home I reversed my route and spent some time in Bangkok at a friend-of-a-friend’s apartment while she was out of the country (nice!), and finished my trip back in Hong Kong. My NGO friend knew people in HK and one guy took me to dinner at the restaurant on top of Victoria Peak (touristy, but a great view). We decided to splurge and get some oysters because I was heading home soon, in four days. Do you know that feeling when you eat something and you know—right then and there—that it's bad? Well, that happened just as I was swallowing one of the oysters ... and it was too late. I figured I’d been building an iron constitution with all of the street cart food I’d been eating for the last couple weeks, so I wasn’t that worried. I went back to my hotel and right on cue: vomiting, chills, fever, that weird “I have food poisoning buzzing feeling,” and um ... spending some time in the bathroom. I took turns sweating out the sheets in the two single beds that were in my room, while each morning (like clockwork), a woman would bang on my door and yell: Day 1 Housekeeping: “MRS (firstname)!!! PEOPLE SAY YOU VERY SICK!! WE COME CLEAN ROOM??" Me: NO. Day 2 Housekeeping: "MRS (firstname)!!! PEOPLE SAY YOU VERY SICK!! WE COME CLEAN ROOM??" Me: NO. Please go away, thank you. Day 3 Housekeeping: "MRS (firstname)!!! PEOPLE SAY YOU VERY SICK!! WE COME CLEAN ROOM??" Me: NO. But do you have more toilet paper? Day 4 Housekeeping: “MRS (firstname)!!! PEOPLE SAY YOU VERY SICK!! WE COME CLEAN ROOM??" Me: ...... On Day 4, I had no choice but to drag my sorry butt out of the room and clamber on to a shuttle bus to the airport because my flight was leaving (for Vancouver, natch). The trip back to my apartment in Seattle was the most miserable multi-day journey I’ve ever taken. I don’t think I’ve ever cried so hard. Oysters are still the only food I won’t eat. If you also have a horror story from hors d’oeuvres, shoot us a note. In the meantime, bon appétit: I was in Barbados in a rural bar, hungry. I asked for food and they said they had one thing. And that’s how I had pickled chicken feet for dinner. It was sloshed out of a big bin. Update from Jacob, an “11th grader and avid fan of The Atlantic”: As a high school student, I haven’t had too many bad travel experiences, but this one’s a doozy, and when I saw your callout I immediately knew I had to submit. A few weeks ago, I traveled to South Korea for 10 days to present a collaborative science project with my Korean partners. My troubles started at around 5 o'clock the day before final presentations. We had just finished reviewing critique of our rehearsal when I suddenly began to feel sick to my stomach. Wanting to go back to my room, I went to notify Jeong-Minh, the director of the program, and was in the midst of a conversation with her in the hallway when a roiling wave of nausea hit me. I sprinted to the trash can, doubled over, and projectile vomited not one, not two, but three whole times in a spray of half-digested Korean food. Jeong-Minh just barely had the presence of mind to leap backward out of the splash zone. Hoping against hope this was just a one-and-done vomiting session, I fled back to my dormitory, only to spend the next day vomiting violently into a pink Hello-Kitty trash can with the worst case of food poisoning since the Borgias. I’m never going to be able to look at that damn cat again without a degree of horror. I would upchuck into the can, manage to fall back into a light sleep in that refractory period of relief just after a bout of vomiting, then wake up 30 minutes later to bend myself back over Hello Kitty and loose another wave. Eventually I was just dry heaving little trickles of bile. It was the sickest I’ve ever been in my life. I stopped vomiting after 24 hours, but my stomach was an achy mess for the rest of the trip, and I was holed up against my will in the dormitory for most of it, taking Buzzfeed quizzes to distract myself from the fact that it still felt like Kim Jong was conducting a nuclear weapons test in my intestines. I’m not sure why the universe saw fit to punish me that way. I have a sneaking suspicion that my weak little white stomach couldn’t handle the platters of traditional Korean food I'd been tucking away the entire trip. It must have been those “specialty” highland mushrooms. Chris Bodenner 8:45 AM / August 1, 2016 A Trip Through Eastern Europe Turns South A reader’s memory of a hellish trip to Istanbul still sounds fresh: In the early ‘90s, my young husband and I thrived on traveling as frugally as possible. We were traveling from Scandinavia and our goal was to make it to Istanbul. On a train from Poland to Romania, we were warned by a fellow tourist not to change money on the black market, because the undercover police “may arrest you.” Armed with that information, we arrived at the train station on a Sunday, eager to purchase our tickets to Istanbul and leave Romania as quickly as possible. The “Official Money Station" was manned when we approached to change our currency. “No money,” he shrugged and waved us away. With no Romanian currency, we had no money for food, lodging, or train tickets. A friendly young Romanian man approached offering to help us change money on the black market. He promised he was not a police officer. Continue Reading He told us he knew of a bus station that would take us from Bucharest to Istanbul. He led us out of the station and around a corner to a small bus ticket station, and, while he practiced English with my husband, I hand-signaled with an older woman enough for her to accept my $20 USD for our ride out. When we informed our friendly translator/guide that we no longer required his services, he kicked my husband in the shin (my husband was a towering 6'4”) and declared that he would “get his gun and come back to shoot us.” We were completely terror-stricken. The locals, who spoke no English, just looked at us and smiled while we ran to duck behind the ticket counter. The proprietor followed us back and said: “Me Turk. No problem.” Then he opened his top drawer to reveal a machete. We were relieved and willing when the un-air-conditioned, broken-down bus arrived to take us away, shuttling us to a standard-looking coach bus filled with Italian tourists. Everyone smoked cigarettes. Music blared. Not a word of English was spoken. There was no toilet on the bus. We made it as far as the border of Bulgaria. The bus stopped and turned off the engine in a long trail of cars and buses. Apparently everyone who was supposed to be working the border was preoccupied watching the World Cup Soccer Championship matches.   For nine hours, all traffic was halted while the games played. We exited the bus and wandered across streams of garbage and gypsy children playing on train tracks. Hours later on the bus, mosquitos buzzing, my husband finally fell asleep, but I was desperate to pee. The driver escorted me off the bus and watched me urinate. Then he put his arm around me and attempted to invite me to join him somewhere else. I elbowed him with all of my might and jumped back on the bus. I shook my husband out of his slumber and did not allow him to sleep after that. The border crossing finally reopened. They collected our passports and handed each passenger two cartons of cigarettes and eight bottles of alcohol to carry as contraband mules across the border. They stocked the back of the bus, and our passports were returned. Twenty-five hours later, I saw the minarets and knew we had arrived. I developed a migraine and threw up. But at least we made it to Istanbul. Bonus anecdote from another reader, in Ukraine: I’m 19 years old on train from Lviv to Kiev. It’s an overnighter and I’m booked in a 2nd class sleeper car which has four bunks on each side. I’m scared out of my mind when I realize I’m the only woman in the compartment. The men see that I’m freaking out and find a translator to explain (actual words): “We want to reassure you that your body is safe and we will not rape you as you sleep.” Thanks?   Chris Bodenner 2:45 PM / July 29, 2016 Tell Us: What's Your Worst Travel Experience? A bunch of Atlantic readers in this discussion group are exchanging their travel horror stories. (If you’d like to sharing your own, please send us a note: hello@theatlantic.com.) A short anecdote from the group: I caught bronchitis when I was in Germany for a business trip. Spent the plane ride home sitting next to a strange drunk man who kept talking at me. Intolerable Cruelty starring George Clooney and Catherine Zeta-Jones was the in-flight movie. I wanted to die. Another reader shares that sentiment: I was stuck in the snowbound Omaha airport with a three year old, a chihuahua, and a small carryon bag, for TWO DAYS. That was the ninth circle of hell. I wanted to die. This next reader nearly did, for real: Peace Corps: On a bus in Guatemala. A group of three teens in MS-13 [a notorious gang] decide to rob our bus. Being the only American on the bus and having just gone to the bank, I took all the money I had hidden in my bra and put it in my pocket ready to be robbed. People would get shot if they tried to run, so I prepared to give everything and pulled my passport out of its hiding spot in my bag so I made sure they knew they were getting it. Then some dude decided to John Wayne and open fire on these robbers, which resulted in a firefight on a very crowded bus. I had actually been the next passenger to be robbed, so the perp standing next to me was actively shooting. I dove under the seat and stayed there until literally everyone else had gotten off the bus. Bonus trip: I got a lightly armored security escort back to the embassy. This reader’s experience is much more relatable: I travel for work, so I have A LOT of these stories. I have two that beat out all of the other minor upsets though: Continue Reading 1) I started a flight with a guy interrupting me while I was reading just so he could tell me that he “might grab my knee” because he’s “afraid of flying.” I replied, “the fuck you will.” Then he proceeded to vape for the entire flight. When I pointed out that it’s a federal crime to do that, he said he had really bad cravings. AND THEN, as he was deplaning, he hit his lady-friend square on her read end ... it was the cherry on top of a disturbing trip. 2) THE WORST was when I was flying from Chicago to Manchester last October. The man sitting next to me spread all over my seat, took off his shoes, AND unbuttoned his pants. And when I asked to get out to use the restroom, he suggested that I just “climb over my lap, baby.” Another reader, Nick, also had a creepy encounter: On a six-hour train ride in China, a man stared at me the entire fucking time. Like literally he didn’t move his eyes off me. I don’t know if that was worse than the time I was really sick on a transatlantic flight, but it was definitely the weirdest. This next reader thinks back to Memorial Day weekend in the late ‘90s: I’m living on Long Island and using what precious little vacation and holiday time I have to visit my LDR girlfriend in Rochester. I have my friend drop me off at JFK in the late afternoon with maybe an hour to spare before boarding (plenty of time, as this is pre-TSA). As I’m waiting, the delays start piling up on the info screen because of some freak storm over half of the country, though the local weather is fine. My flight gets delayed, of course. Over the next few hours, the delay gets pushed further and further back. Finally, it gets cancelled. But by then it’s way too late to call any of my friends to pick me up. So I can either spend the night in pre-renovated JFK, or take a two-hour train ride home so I can sleep in my own bed for a few hours before trying again in the morning. Both options suck, but I figure some sleep is better than none and head out to the train. Now we come to the actual bad part. I have to take a rail shuttle from the airport to the station, then take two different subway rides into Penn Station, where I can catch a LIRR train to take me home. The first ride is uneventful. On the second one, however, I’m joined by a couple of young women a few seats in front of me, a younger man who goes to the back, and another younger man who does not take a seat but quickly sets to trying to impress the two women. Also worth noting is that I’m the only person on board who isn’t black. The young hotshot starts sort-of-rapping about how tough and badass he is. The women seem unimpressed as far as I can tell, but really this whole time I’ve just been trying very hard to focus on the Robert Anton Wilson book I’m reading. Hotshot changes tactics and tries to impress them by provoking me into a fight. He gets in my face and taunts me for being in the wrong place or something, but I just shake my head and keep my eyes on my book. The train slows and starts to pull up to the next platform. He disappears behind me, and a few seconds later something hard hits me in the back of my head. At this point I’m exhausted, frustrated, and already very angry about the flight situation. I was running on fumes and adrenaline. So when I got hit, something in me just snapped. I remember folding the book and putting it down. Thoughts about my physical abilities versus his and the possibility that he may have a weapon immediately popped up. The angry animal part of my brain was in charge, though, so I disregarded them just as quickly. I stood up and turned around to face whatever this guy thought he was going to do to me. The doors are open and he is gone. At my feet is the small, depleted corn cob from a discarded KFC meal box. I wipe some bits of kernel from the back of my head and neck. The women and guy from the back all rush over to me to make sure I’m okay. After we’re all sure I’m fine, the guy says, “It’s too bad he ran off.

Spencer saluted more than 200 attendees on Saturday, gathered at the Ronald Reagan Building in Washington, D.C., for the annual conference of the National Policy Institute, which describes itself as “an independent organization dedicated to the heritage, identity, and future of  people of European descent in the United States, and around the world.” Spencer has popularized the term “alt-right” to describe the movement he leads. Spencer has said his dream is “a new society, an ethno-state that would be a gathering point for all Europeans,” and has called for “peaceful ethnic cleansing.” For most of the day, a parade of speakers discussed their ideology in relatively anodyne terms, putting a presentable face on their agenda. But after dinner, when most journalists had already departed, Spencer rose and delivered a speech to his followers dripping with anti-Semitism, and leaving no doubt as to what he actually seeks. He referred to the mainstream media as “Lügenpresse,” a term he said he was borrowing from “the original German”; the Nazis used the word to attack their critics in the press. Continue Reading Mike Segar / Reuters The Electoral College Was Meant to Stop Men Like Trump From Being President Peter Beinart The founders envisioned electors as people who could prevent an irresponsible demagogue from taking office. Americans talk about democracy like it’s sacred. In public discourse, the more democratic American government is, the better. The people are supposed to rule. But that’s not the premise that underlies America’s political system. Most of the men who founded the United States feared unfettered majority rule. James Madison wrote in Federalist 10 that systems of government based upon “pure democracy … have ever been found incompatible with personal security or the rights of property.” John Adams wrote in 1814 that, “Democracy never lasts long. It soon wastes, exhausts and murders itself.” The framers constructed a system that had democratic features. The people had a voice. They could, for instance, directly elect members of the House of Representatives. But the founders also self-consciously limited the people’s voice.

But we also use it when we’re all alone; it shapes even our silent relationships with ourselves. In his book, The Voices Within, Charles Fernyhough gives a historical overview of “inner speech”—the more scientific term for “talking to yourself in your head.” Fernyhough, a professor at Durham University in the U.K., says that inner speech develops alongside social speech. This idea was pioneered by Lev Vygotsky, a Russian psychologist who studied children in the 1920s and noted that when they learned to talk to other humans, they also learned how to talk to themselves, first out loud, and eventually, in their heads. Continue Reading Yamada Taro / Getty What’s So Great About American World Leadership? Hugh White The U.S. voters who rejected decades of bipartisan foreign-policy consensus might be on to something. How has America come to elect a president who so starkly repudiated decades’ worth of the largely bipartisan vision of U.S. global leadership? And if that vision won’t be the basis of American foreign policy in the 21st century, what will replace it? The big message of 2016 is that large numbers of American voters, Democrat and Republican, do not buy what their political leaders have been selling for so long, and that includes foreign policy. The evidence of this from Trump’s victory is reinforced by Senator Bernie Sanders’ remarkable showing in the Democratic primaries, and by years’ worth of public-opinion surveys showing the widespread view that the United States “does too much in helping solve world problems.” It is also reinforced by the high poll numbers of an outgoing president who has mounted his own quiet campaign against key elements of Washington’s foreign-policy orthodoxy. Continue Reading Carlo Allegri / Reuters Donald Trump's Conflicts of Interest: A Crib Sheet Jeremy Venook A semi-comprehensive list of the business concerns that may influence the president-elect as he prepares for the nation’s highest office Though several previous presidents have entered office with private fortunes to their names, none has done so with a business empire nearly as large or complicated as that of President-elect Donald J. Trump. Estimates of Trump’s wealth vary substantially: While he self-reports a net worth of $10 billion, independent agencies have arrived at valuation generally between $3 billion and $5 billion. The unprecedented nature of Trump’s business interests, coupled with the many precedents that Trump broke throughout his campaign—not releasing his tax returns, for example, which severely limits attempts to understand his financial situation—has provoked speculation that his presidency may bring about equally unprecedented opportunities for conflicts of interest. Trump’s response—provided on Twitter—only reinforces concerns that he will make little effort to avoid entangling his business and personal interests, and will instead attack those who point that out. Continue Reading Etienne Fabre / SSAC A Shocking Find In a Neanderthal Cave In France Ed Yong A rock structure, built deep underground, is one of the earliest hominin constructions ever found. In February 1990, thanks to a 15-year-old boy named Bruno Kowalsczewski, footsteps echoed through the chambers of Bruniquel Cave for the first time in tens of thousands of years. The cave sits in France’s scenic Aveyron Valley, but its entrance had long been sealed by an ancient rockslide. Kowalsczewski’s father had detected faint wisps of air emerging from the scree, and the boy spent three years clearing away the rubble. He eventually dug out a tight, thirty-meter-long passage that the thinnest members of the local caving club could squeeze through. They found themselves in a large, roomy corridor. There were animal bones and signs of bear activity, but nothing recent. The floor was pockmarked with pools of water. The walls were punctuated by stalactites (the ones that hang down) and stalagmites (the ones that stick up). Continue Reading sketchblog/flickr Masters of Love Emily Esfahani Smith Science says lasting relationships come down to—you guessed it—kindness and generosity. Every day in June, the most popular wedding month of the year, about 13,000 American couples will say “I do,” committing to a lifelong relationship that will be full of friendship, joy, and love that will carry them forward to their final days on this earth. Except, of course, it doesn’t work out that way for most people. The majority of marriages fail, either ending in divorce and separation or devolving into bitterness and dysfunction. Of all the people who get married, only three in ten remain in healthy, happy marriages, as psychologist Ty Tashiro points out in his book The Science of Happily Ever After, which was published earlier this year. Social scientists first started studying marriages by observing them in action in the 1970s in response to a crisis: Married couples were divorcing at unprecedented rates. Worried about the impact these divorces would have on the children of the broken marriages, psychologists decided to cast their scientific net on couples, bringing them into the lab to observe them and determine what the ingredients of a healthy, lasting relationship were. Was each unhappy family unhappy in its own way, as Tolstoy claimed, or did the miserable marriages all share something toxic in common? Continue Reading Chris Keane / Reuters What's Really Going On in North Carolina's Gubernatorial Race? David A. Graham Recounts, lawsuits, challenges—and the prospect of a legislative coup? Here’s why the race between Governor Pat McCrory and Democrat Roy Cooper isn’t over yet. DURHAM, N.C.—It’s been two weeks since Election Day, which means that in 49 states, residents know who their governor will be next year. North Carolinians, however, are still waiting to see. At the end of balloting on November 8, Democrat Roy Cooper, the current state attorney general, had a lead of a few thousand votes over Governor Pat McCrory, a Republican. Cooper promptly declared victory, but McCrory has not conceded the race, and the state has not been able to declare a winner. On Monday, Cooper announced a transition team, while McCrory accused him of “circumventing the electoral process.” Cooper’s lead fluctuated throughout the day on Tuesday as more counties returned their final canvass, but as of writing it was a little more than 6,000 votes out of roughly 4,700,000. (The most up-to-date results are here.)

The typical 29-year-old is living with a partner in the suburbs—without a bachelor’s degree. What is the typical life experience for an American on the verge of turning 30? This is a hard question to answer, no matter who is asking. But it’s become especially difficult for an industry responsible with providing the answers: the national press. An irony of digital media is that the Internet distributes journalism, but it concentrates journalists. Jobs at media sites like The Atlantic, BuzzFeed, or Gawker are five-times more likely to be located in New York or Washington, D.C., than television-news jobs. The clustering force is only getting more centripetal: The share of reporting jobs in Los Angeles, NYC, and DC increased by 60 percent between 2004 and 2014. It’s easy to imagine many downsides of this agglomeration, like the dissolution of local reporting, but a subtler risk is that well-educated journalists in these dense cities wind up with a skewed impression of the world, a “majority illusion” based on the extremely unrepresentative cross-section of the country that’s immediately around them. To be fair, being a reporter in Des Moines or rural Nebraska, while it provides a better view of Des Moines and rural Nebraska, doesn’t offer a universal window into the average experiences of all Americans, either. For that, one needs something else, like a national survey.

Like Dallas News' Facebook Page Get Unlimited Digital Access Your first month is less than a dollar. $0.99 for first 4 weeks Subscribe Now A linchpin to government accountability lies in the old admonition to "follow the money." But that's an impossible task when the law says the government -- and companies doing business with government -- can legally hide the trail. The fallout from a June 2015 ruling by the Texas Supreme Court is becoming painfully clear as key details of government contracts, once routine items of public disclosure, are instead being withheld as guarded state secrets. A random sampling: Costs of a Kaufman County school district's food service contract. The number of Uber drivers ferrying passengers around Houston. And, amusingly, in an anxiety-inducing sort of way, the amount the city of McAllen paid singer Enrique Iglesias for an hour-long outdoor concert to lead off its annual holiday parade last December. All result from from a 7-1 opinion by the state's highest court, made over the objections of Attorney General Ken Paxton's office. The decision expanded the acceptable reasons for withholding information about contracts between government and private businesses. The decision in Boeing vs. Paxton stems from the giant aircraft manufacturer's claim that disclosing financial information about its contract with the inland Port of San Antonio could give an edge to its business competitors. That opinion, a reversal of two lower court rulings, is a dramatic reinterpretation of financial disclosure exemptions originally meant to protect the contract bidding process. "It's one of the worst rulings ever to come out of the Texas Supreme Court," said open government attorney Joe Larsen, a board member for the Freedom of Information Foundation of Texas, in an interview with the Texas Tribune. "If there's a place where corruption can fester, it's here." To be clear: This is not a matter of protecting business trade secrets from unfair exposure. Provisions for protecting proprietary information existed in the Texas Public Information Act prior to the Boeing decision. "Open government people realize there are some things business should protect," former Deputy Texas Attorney General Bill Cobb told the Houston Chronicle in May. "But there is clear direction and standard on what you have to do to prove that." The new decision, he said, "blew a hole" in state public disclosure laws. This should be a matter of bipartisan concern, and there are encouraging signs of bipartisan action in the next state legislative session. State Rep. Terry Canales, D-Edinburg, who took notice of the issue with the furor over McAllen's refusal to disclose Iglesias' performance fee, is reportedly contemplating whether to introduce corrective legislation specifically targeting entertainment contracts or taking a broader approach to the exemptions. And a spokesman for Rep. Giovanni Capriglione, R-Southlake, is also said to be working with open records advocates on a remedy to restore at least some of the transparency the ruling has cost. More legislators on both sides of the aisle need to pay attention. Public accountability matters, and transparency is where accountability starts. In their own words "It's one of the worst rulings ever to come out of the Texas Supreme Court. If there's any place where corruption can fester, it's here." -- Joe Larsen, open government advocate and board member, Freedom of Information Foundation of Texas  "The court opened the floodgates on this one. It blew a hole in the Texas Public Information Act." -- Bill Cobb, former Texas deputy attorney general under then-Attorney General Greg Abbott View Comments Tags Editorials Opinion Texas Legislature Share Facebook Twitter Email Print This Story Get the Most Important D-FW News in Your Inbox Sign up for our daily email newsletters Get Headlines, Business, SportsDay, and GuideLive.

More Comments LinkedIn Tumblr Pinterest Digg FarkIt StumbleUpon OTTAWA — The F-35 stealth fighter, described by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau as “far from working,” has been declared by the U.S. Air Force as ready for combat. In a statement Tuesday, U.S. Air Force Gen. Hawk Carlisle, commander of Air Combat Command, said the air force version of the aircraft has met all key criteria for reaching initial operational capability. “I am proud to announce this powerful new weapons system has achieved initial combat capability,” Carlisle said. “The F-35A will be the most dominant aircraft in our inventory, because it can go where our legacy aircraft cannot and provide the capabilities our commanders need on the modern battlefield.” The declaration is sure to cause more political headaches for the Liberal government. In early June, as the debate continued over which fighter jet should be selected to replace Canada’s CF-18s, Trudeau dismissed the F-35, claiming the jet “does not work and is far from working.” The F-35A is the aircraft once considered by Canada and could in future be a potential contender for any CF-18 replacement. During last year’s election campaign, Trudeau promised Canada would not purchase the F-35, an aircraft he said was too expensive and unnecessary for the country’s needs. But last week five defence firms, including Lockheed Martin, the manufacturer of the F-35, responded to the Liberal government’s call for information about fighter jets that could replace the CF-18s. Boeing Co. submitted information on its Super Hornet, Lockheed Martin on the F-35, Dassault Aviation on the Rafale, Eurofighter GmbH on the Typhoon and Saab Group on the Gripen. How the Liberals will now proceed on fighter-jet replacement is unknown. Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan has said the bidding process would be open and has argued that the CF-18s have to be replaced as soon as possible. But asked recently when the Liberal government will know how it is going to proceed, Sajjan said he couldn’t provide specific details. “It all depends on a lot of the information that we do collect, but it is going to be months, not years definitely because of the urgency for this,” he said.  “I can’t give you a precise date but, like I said, it will be in the months coming.” The F-35 became a major political headache several years ago for the Conservative government. Although a Liberal government originally signed on to a research and development program for the plane, the Conservatives significantly expanded commitment and later agreed to the purchase 65 jets. But the program was dogged by controversy and the aircraft faced numerous technical problems. Related Liberals pay $33 million to stay in F -35 development program, despite promise not to buy the fighter jet Eight CF-18s deployed for month to U.S.-led exercise despite Liberals’ warning of jet shortage U.S. Navy pilots report oxygen shortage while flying Super Hornet jets being considered by Liberals The Department of National Defence originally claimed the project would cost about $14.7 billion, but then-parliamentary budget officer Kevin Page put the price tag at about $29 billion. Auditor general Michael Ferguson also issued a report that concluded DND officials withheld key information from Parliament about the fighter-jet purchase, underestimated costs and didn’t follow proper procurement rules. An independent audit on Canada’s proposed F-35 project found the purchase of the aircraft would cost $44 billion over the 42-year life of the plane. That included everything from maintenance to fuel. In addition, some U.S. lawmakers have raised concerns the aircraft is too expensive and won’t be able to fulfill its military’s requirements. But aerospace industry officials say the declaration that F-35A is ready for combat is good news for the troubled aircraft program. But others point out that more development of the plane is needed. A fighter squadron in Utah is the U.S. Air Force’s first operational F-35A unit. The U.S. Marines had earlier declared another version of the F-35 ready for combat. • Email: dpugliese@postmedia.com | Twitter: davidpugliese Find National Post on Facebook Twitter Google+ Reddit Email Typo?

Trump included a call for a 15% corporate rate in a Detroit speech where he outlined other tax and economic reforms. Business groups have long said their members are hurt because US companies pay the most federal income tax - a 35% rate, though the effective rate is often lower - among the 35 countries in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development. “The fact that he is pushing for a 15% corporate tax rate is definitely a positive,” said Dorothy Coleman, vice president of tax and domestic economic policy for the National Association of Manufacturers. “Tax reform is really one of the important goals that we have.” The Rate Coalition, which lists Boeing, Ford and Wal-Mart among corporate supporters, said it won’t endorse all aspects of Trump’s plan but that the tax proposal is a “huge step in the right direction and we urge other candidates in the race to follow his lead.” Trump also called for a 10% levy on overseas cash that companies have been unwilling to bring home because of high US taxes. The US rate also impedes foreign investment in the country, Coleman said, and some American companies have used acquisitions to set up headquarters in foreign countries with lower taxes. For small businesses, the proposal was a “home run,” said Juanita Duggan, chief executive officer of the National Federation of Independent Business. It would provide the same 15% rate for companies no matter their size, freeing up funds to invest back into family businesses, she said. “He got that exactly right,” Duggan said. “Small business cannot pay a higher rate than Exxon Mobil.” Tax rates The US last adjusted its corporate tax in 1993 when it was pushed up by a percentage point to 35%, said Alan Cole, an economist with the Tax Foundation’s Centre for Federal Tax Policy. Under a 1986 tax bill, the rate was phased down to 34% from 46%, he said. Countries around the world have steadily been ratcheting down their tax rate to become more competitive, Cole said. The average corporate tax rate when including state levies and weighted by the size of economy has declined to about 29% from 36% in 2003. The US corporate tax when including state levies is about 39%, according to the OECD. “Most countries have been moving down while the US has stood still,” he said. The manufacturers association still wants to see more particulars on Trump’s plan, as well as more incentive for capital spending and research and development, Coleman said: “The devil is in the details on this.” Read Fin24's top stories trending on Twitter: Fin24’s top stories Follow Fin24 on Twitter, Facebook, Google+ and Pinterest. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.

Think tanks are non-profit policy research establishments with tax-exempt status, as they are assumed to be doing work to advance the public good, not cater to private interests. Traditional lobbying of the federal government is likewise regulated to promote transparency. When the rules become too onerous, or the public image of a corporation is stained by its overt solicitations for policy change, think tanks become a useful corporate device, the New York Times has found, in a Sunday report jointly researched with the New England Center for Investigative Reporting (NECIR). In one instance, drone manufacturer and military contractor General Atomics sought the services of the think tank Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS). With the Afghanistan and Iraq wars in a slump in 2013, fewer drones were being sold to the US military. The California-based maker of Predator drones needed to find customers abroad, but weapons trade restrictions at the time prohibited their export. Following a donation of tens of thousands of dollars to CSIS – a small sum compared to other donors such as Lockheed Martin and Boeing, the Times reported – the think tank not only completed a study on drone policy and export in 2014, but actually arranged secret meetings in its office headquarters with officials from the Air Force, Marine Corps, Navy and the State Department as well as the secretary of defense. General Atomics now had prime access to policymakers in the think tank space to advance its business goals. The State Department then released new trade rules in February 2015, encouraging fewer limits on the export of drones, leading to a deal between General Atomics and the United Arab Emirates. The sale of unarmed drones to a non-NATO country was the first of its kind, according to the Times. The Brookings Institution, a left-leaning powerhouse in Washington, had “thousands of pages of internal memos and confidential correspondence,” with for-profit businesses, including JPMorgan Chase, the biggest of the big US banks, the Times-NECIR report said. Offering “donation benefits” in its memos, Brookings appeared to “blur the lines” between offering neutral research and corporate public relations, according to the report. Called a “university without students,” Brookings was named “Top think tank in the world” in a 2015 report by the University of Pennsylvania. Founded in 1916, the think tank operates on an average annual income of $107.5 million, according to TheBestSchools.org, which lists it as number 7 of the 50 most influential think tanks in the US. The Times-NECIR report said that dollar figure represents a doubling in the tank’s budget in the last decade. According to the report, JPMorgan made a tax-deductible donation of $15.5 million 2011 to Brookings' Metropolitan Policy Program, the largest sum of money ever received by the institution from a private company. However, what came out of that gift was a brand new project dubbed the Global Cities Initiative. It even had a logo including the line “joint project of Brookings and JPMorgan Chase,” a corporate rebranding tactic some argue. The project encouraged both local economic growth and international trade, of which JPMorgan would have a major stake in through its business loan programs. “Bottom line: Growing metro economies is good for the nation and for JPMC; also, many U.S. cities are JPMC clients — motivation to support them and their clients,” a July 2011 internal Brookings document read, according to the Times-NECIR report. The appearance of quid-pro-quo was not lost on those at Brookings. “No one wants to create overt marketing opportunities for JPMC, but we need to carve out roles and thought leadership opportunity for market presidents,” read a 2013 Brookings memo referring to a dinner with JPMorgan executives, the Times reported. “We need to do a better job tying it back to JPMC.” Based on the documents obtained via an open records request, the report appears to reflect an open secret on Capitol Hill. In September 2015, Brookings lost Robert Litan as a senior fellow economist, after he was accused of withholding information showing a conflict of interest in his own research against financial reform related to retirement advising, the International Business Times reported. The pressure came came from Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Massachusetts), who called Litan “an industry player seeking a specific conclusion.” Warren spoke to the New York Times for its recent report, regarding the consequences of special interested-peddled research when it reaches congressional chambers. “[Corporations] take a lot of money, because they got plenty of money to spend. They put it into a think tank, with a few strings attached, and the think tank comes up with the research that just so happens to advance the interests of the corporation,” Warren said, adding, “That then means, right here in the Senate, we can make bad decisions … not decisions that favor the American people.” Brookings executive vice president Martin S. Indyk denies the implied allegations. “We do not compromise our integrity,” Indyk told the New York Times. “We maintain our core values of quality, independence, as well as impact,” adding that Brookings recently disallowed any corporation or corporate-supported entity from contributing anonymously.

Manufacturers call 15% corporate rate ‘definitely positive’ Lobby groups say more details needed on spending, R&D breaks Share on FacebookShare on Twitter Share on LinkedInShare on RedditShare on Google+E-mailShare on TwitterShare on WhatsApp Small-business and manufacturers’ groups praised a proposal by Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump to take the U.S. federal corporate tax from the highest to one of the lowest among developed nations. Trump included a call for a 15 percent corporate rate in a Detroit speech where he outlined other tax and economic reforms. Business groups have long said their members are hurt because U.S. companies pay the most federal income tax -- a 35 percent rate, though the effective rate is often lower -- among the 35 countries in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. “The fact that he is pushing for a 15 percent corporate tax rate is definitely a positive,” said Dorothy Coleman, vice president of tax and domestic economic policy for the National Association of Manufacturers. “Tax reform is really one of the important goals that we have.” The Rate Coalition, which lists Boeing Co., Ford Motor Co. and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. among corporate supporters, said it won’t endorse all aspects of Trump’s plan but that the tax proposal is a “huge step in the right direction and we urge other candidates in the race to follow his lead.” Trump also called for a 10 percent levy on overseas cash that companies have been unwilling to bring home because of high U.S. taxes. The U.S. rate also impedes foreign investment in the country, Coleman said, and some American companies have used acquisitions to set up headquarters in foreign countries with lower taxes. For small businesses, the proposal was a “home run,” said Juanita Duggan, chief executive officer of the National Federation of Independent Business. It would provide the same 15 percent rate for companies no matter their size, freeing up funds to invest back into family businesses, she said. “He got that exactly right,” Duggan said. “Small business cannot pay a higher rate than Exxon Mobil.” Tax Rates The U.S. last adjusted its corporate tax in 1993 when it was pushed up by a percentage point to 35 percent, said Alan Cole, an economist with the Tax Foundation’s Center for Federal Tax Policy. Under a 1986 tax bill, the rate was phased down to 34 percent from 46 percent, he said. Countries around the world steadily have been ratcheting down their tax rate to become more competitive, Cole said. The average corporate tax rate when including state levies and weighted by the size of economy has declined to about 29 percent from 36 percent in 2003. The U.S. corporate tax when including state levies is about 39 percent, according to the OECD. “Most countries have been moving down while the U.S. has stood still,” he said. Tel Ganesan, CEO of technology-staffing firm Kyyba Inc. who attended the Trump event in Detroit, said he likes the tax-cut proposal and thinks the billionaire businessman would be better on the economy than Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. Still Ganesan, who came to the U.S. from India, is hesitant to support Trump because of his controversial stances on immigration. Watch Next: Will Trump's Tax Pledge Give him a Poll Boost? “He knows the economy better than anybody else,” Ganesan said. “He knows what it takes to get the economy going.” The U.S. Chamber of Commerce didn’t issue a statement on the Trump speech and referred questions to a video that calls for lower rates and a globally competitive system. The manufacturers association still wants to see more particulars on Trump’s plan, as well as more incentive for capital spending and research and development, Coleman said: “The devil is in the details on this.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

NASA says the first SLS/Orion mission is on schedule for the fall of 2018, but recent GAO reports have raised issues about the schedule for that mission, and a crewed mission NASA wants to fly in 2021. (credit: NASA) Scrutinizing NASA’s exploration efforts by Jeff Foust Monday, August 8, 2016 Neither of the two major party candidates for president, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, have offered many details about what changes, if any, they would make to NASA’s major programs if elected (see “The one space policy question for the candidates”, The Space Review, August 1, 2016). It’s reasonable to assume, though, that at some point after taking office they’ll perform some kind of assessment of some major ongoing efforts, like the Space Launch System and Orion. That could be an internal study or an independent outside review, like what President Obama did in 2009 with the Augustine Committee, which ultimately led to the cancellation of Project Constellation. “All of our teams today believe we can get there,” said NASA’s Hill on plans to launch EM-1 in the fall of 2018. So what would that hypothetical review of NASA’s human space exploration efforts find? Based on recent statements, it depends on who you talk to. While NASA officials state they’re making good progress on SLS and Orion, as well as supporting ground equipment, analyses by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) suggest those efforts face cost and schedule problems that could pose problems for the next administration. Keeping EM-1 on track “This is an amazing period of time in human spaceflight,” said Bill Gerstenmaier, NASA associate administrator for human exploration and operations, in a July 25 meeting of a NASA Advisory Council committee. Gerstenmaier was showing a chart illustrating the various locations in the US where hardware, including both NASA’s human exploration systems as well as those being developed by Boeing and SpaceX for commercial crew, were being built. “I don’t think we’ve had this much flight hardware, this much manufacturing, this much development activity, ever in place since Apollo.” The emphasis of Gerstenmaier’s presentation was on SLS, Orion and Exploration Ground Systems as they move towards the first SLS flight, Exploration Mission 1 (EM-1). “We’re moving forward on all these pieces, all this hardware starts showing up down at the Cape next year,” he said. “We’re roughly about two years away from flight of EM-1.” Specifically, the EM-1 launch is planned for between September and November of 2018, a date agency leadership says is realistic. “All of our teams today believe we can get there,” said Bill Hill, deputy associate administrator for exploration systems development, of that planned date in a presentation following Gerstenmaier at the committee meeting. “We have some challenges, but we believe we can get there.” Foremost among those challenges is development of the Orion service module, which the European Space Agency is providing to NASA. The module completed its critical design review just a few weeks before the meeting, Gerstenmaier said, and manufacturing is in progress, but is running behind schedule. “We had planned on getting the service module from the Europeans in January. We will now get that service module more likely in April,” he said. “We’re preparing for it to be even a little bit later than that.” That delay ripples through the rest of the program as Orion comes together with SLS at the Kennedy Space Center in advance of the fall 2018 launch. Gerstenmaier said that the program is looking at changing testing schedules to keep the overall launch on track. That could include doing a “wet dress rehearsal” for the SLS launch without Orion being there. “We’ve got a lot of milestones under review,” Hill said. “Our ground systems folks are out ahead of it, taking a look at that. As Gerst said, we’re looking at redoing the flow on the ground systems. They’ve got some good ideas of how to get there.” “We’re in the process of building a robust schedule that can deal with the problems we may see going forward,” Gerstenmaier said. Gerstenmaier said he expected more complications as the EM-1 launch approached, requiring more adjustments to the schedule to maintain the planned launch date. “SLS will face this same kind of part challenge when they start bringing all these parts together, especially outfitting the engine section and putting all the plumbing and ducting in,” he said. “We should see some problems through that whole activity as we do that work on the SLS.” “But again, I think we’ve got reasonable margins in our schedules,” he emphasized. “We’re in the process of building a robust schedule that can deal with the problems we may see going forward.” After EM-1 comes EM-2, the first crewed SLS/Orion mission. A review nearly a year ago set the launch of that mission to be as late as April 2023, driven by completing development of Orion so it can support crews. However, NASA said then that it would work to an earlier date, in 2021, for that mission. That’s still the case today. “Right now we’re holding EM-2 to an August ’21 launch date,” Hill said. Skepticism from the GAO A few days later, though, the GAO offered a more skeptical take. In a report on the Orion program, it raised questions about the cost and schedule estimates used by the program. The program, it argued, failed to meet many best practices for developing its cost and schedule estimates. “As a result, decision makers have reduced insight into program performance and do not have a foundational baseline upon which to make decisions,” the report stated. The GAO in particular raised issue with NASA’s use of that August 2021 launch date for EM-2. That internal goal, coupled with its estimated cost of $10.8 billion, has a “joint confidence level” of 40 percent, which means that NASA has only a 40 percent chance of having Orion ready for EM-2 by that date and at that cost. The April 2023 date, the official baseline, has a joint confidence level of 70 percent. NASA does allow programs to set more aggressive internal goals, but the GAO noted that policy requires those goals to have a joint confidence level of no lower than 50 percent. “Therefore, the program’s cost and schedule is aggressive beyond agency policy, and may increase the risk that the program goes over budget and does not meet its schedule,” the GAO concluded in its report. In addition, the GAO found that NASA was setting aside very little current-year Orion funding for program reserves. “According to Orion program officials, the program has decided to employ most of its available appropriated funds to fund current work and has placed almost all of the funded schedule reserve… towards the end of the internal goal schedule,” the report stated. That could cause problems in the future. “The Orion program may find itself in a similar situation to that experienced by the Constellation [and] JWST programs, which had minimal cost reserves in early years to handle technical challenges that manifested and forced the programs to defer work,” the GAO report stated. “The [Orion] program’s cost and schedule is aggressive beyond agency policy, and may increase the risk that the program goes over budget and does not meet its schedule,” the GAO concluded. A separate report, issued by the GAO the same day, also raised concerns about SLS and Exploration Ground Systems. SLS “has made solid progress in resolving some technical issues and maturing the SLS design,” that report states, but is facing reduced cost and schedule reserves in advance of the EM-1 mission, complicated by what the GAO considers to be a lack of accurate assessments of the development of the SLS core stage. The GAO added that “unforeseen technical challenges are likely to arise once the program reaches its next phase,” when the SLS is completed and integrated with Orion and ground systems, “that will likely place further pressure on cost and schedule reserves.” Development of ground systems, often overlooked in comparison to SLS and Orion, also has its issues. The GAO noted projects to modify the Vehicle Assembly Building and Mobile Launcher to support SLS/Orion missions have used up all of their schedule margins. “As a result, any future delays would have to be accommodated by using the overall program’s schedule reserve,” the GAO stated, adding that the overall Exploration Ground Systems program has only two months of schedule reserve remaining. The GAO reports also raised the issue of costs and available funding. NASA’s exploration programs, particularly SLS and Orion, have done well in recent years, receiving more from Congress than what the administration requested. “’16 was good to us,” Hill said of the fiscal year 2016 appropriations at the July 25 committee meeting. Proposed spending bills in the House and Senate for 2017 also look good, Hill said, but acknowledged that NASA, like the rest of the federal government, will start the new fiscal year in October on a continuing resolution (CR) that funds programs at 2016 levels. That CR could last for as long as six months, he estimated. However, the GAO report stated that NASA’s funding requests for Orion in particular do not support its internal goal of a 2021 launch of EM-1. “Instead, the agency plans to request funding at the level estimated to meet the program’s commitment date of April 2023,” it stated. “As a result, NASA relies on the Congress to appropriate more funds than requested to stay on its internal Orion schedule.” That strategy, the GAO acknowledged, has worked so far. But, it warned, “it may be unrealistic for NASA to expect additional funding each year given the constrained fiscal environment.” While the NASA Advisory Council committee meeting took place before the GAO released its reports, agency officials did give them advance notice the reports were coming out, as NASA had seen, and responded to, a draft version. Hill, speaking at the meeting, sounded a little exasperated by those reviews. “We are really getting kind of overwhelmed with some of these things,” he said, referring to audits by both the GAO and NASA’s Office of Inspector General that he listed on a slide. “Although we have big programs, we have a small group of folks that interact” with auditors, he said. Those reviews, though, may pale in comparison with the examination the next administration might undertake next year of NASA’s exploration programs. And the stakes may be far higher.

Airlines (UAL) today reported July 2016 operational results. UAL's July 2016 consolidated traffic (revenue passenger miles) increased 1.2 percent and consolidated capacity (available seat miles) increased 0.7 percent versus July 2015. UAL's July 2016 consolidated load factor increased 0.5 points compared to July 2015. The company continues to expect third-quarter 2016 consolidated passenger unit revenue to decline 5.5 to 7.5 percent compared to the third quarter of 2015. The year-over-year performance is primarily impacted by demand growth not keeping pace with capacity growth, declining close-in yields, lower surcharges, competitive actions and travel reductions in the energy sector. About United United Airlines and United Express operate more than 4,500 flights a day to 339 airports across five continents.

/PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- NASA Television will bring to viewers around the world live coverage Friday, Aug. 19, as two NASA astronauts install a new gateway for American commercial crew spacecraft at the International Space Station -- a significant milestone in NASA's work to return crew launches to U.S. soil. Coverage of the spacewalk will begin at 6:30 a.m. EDT Aug. 19, on NASA TV and the agency's website, with the spacewalk scheduled to begin at 8:05 a.m. Leading up to the spacewalk, NASA TV will air a briefing from the agency's Johnson Space Center in Houston at 2 p.m. Monday, Aug. 15, during which station and commercial crew experts will discuss the process and significance of installing and connecting the first of two international docking adapters (IDAs) that will be used for the future arrivals of Boeing and SpaceX commercial crew spacecraft. The briefing participants are: Kenneth Todd, International Space Station Operations Integration manager Steve Stich, deputy manager of NASA's Commercial Crew Program Zeb Scoville, spacewalk flight director Glenda Brown, lead spacewalk officer Reporters may attend the briefing at Johnson or ask questions by calling the Johnson newsroom at 281-483-5111 no later than 1:45 p.m. Aug. 15. The adapter was launched on a SpaceX Dragon cargo spacecraft and arrived at the station July 20. Expedition 48 Commander Jeff Williams and Flight Engineer Kate Rubins of NASA will conduct the spacewalk to install the equipment. This will be the fourth spacewalk in Williams' career, the first for Rubins, and the 194th for the space station. The two astronauts will venture outside the space station's Quest airlock to install the first IDA onto Pressurized Mating Adapter-2, located on the forward end of the Harmony module. On Wednesday, Aug. 17, ground controllers will use the Canadarm2 robotic arm, and its attached "Dextre" Special Purpose Dexterous Manipulator, to extract the IDA from the trunk of Dragon, and position it just inches away from PMA-2. There will be no live coverage of the trunk removal and IDA positioning. Commercial crew flights from Florida's Space Coast to the International Space Station will restore America's human spaceflight launch capability and increase the time U.S. crews can dedicate to scientific research, which is helping prepare astronauts for deep space missions, including the journey to Mars. NASA TV's Public Channel (NTV-1) will broadcast enhanced coverage of the spacewalk including operational commentary, in-studio experts and features, and its Media Channel (NTV-3) will broadcast a clean feed of video from space station with operational commentary.

To be clear, it will still take a few more years before construction on the factory is 100% complete, but Tesla was comfortable enough with the progress it has already made to give the world a bit of a glimpse inside the massive structure. While the opening of a factory may seem uneventful if not downright boring in a general sense, Tesla’s Gigafactory is anything but ordinary. Aside from being a physically impressive structure, the Gigafactory’s existence in and of itself is plays a crucial role in Tesla’s quest to manufacture more than 500,000 cars per year by 2020. Now in order to get make that dream a reality, Tesla needs a whole lot of batteries; and because no company on earth can handle the level of battery production Tesla needed, the company up and decided to build its own battery factory, a colossal structure appropriately called the Gigafactory. DON’T MISS: Ultimate Pokemon Go cheat lets you walk anywhere in the game without moving an inch If all goes according to plan, the Gigafactory will eventually double the current level of global lithium-ion battery production. With the grand opening of the Gigafactory now behind us, we’ve put together a list highlighting some of the more interesting facts surrounding the building itself along with a summary of the resources and logistical efforts that went into its development and construction. The Gigafactory will be the biggest building in the world The Gigafactory measures in at 5.5 million square feet, easily making it the biggest building in the world in terms of its physical footprint. The closest building to the Gigafactory is Boeing’s Everett factory in Washington state with a square footage of 4.3 million. To put the size of the Gigafactory into perspective, the following chart courtesy of Visual Capitalist lays things out clearly. By the time the Gigafactory is 100% finished, it will occupy an approximate area of 13 million square feet. Now in terms of overall volume, it’s worth noting that the Boeing factory does have the Gigafactory beat as it’s much taller. The Gigafactory cost $5 billion to construct When the dust settles, it’s believed that the amount of capital invested into the Gigafactory will come out to a cool $5 billion. Construction began in earnest in mid-May of 2014. Battery production levels will be “faster than bullets from a machine gun” Once the Gigafactory is finished and operating at 100% capacity, Tesla boasts that it will churn out more lithium-ion batteries in one year “than were produced worldwide in 2013.” Speaking to this point, Elon Musk during an earnings conference call last year said: “Cells will be going through [the Gigafactory] like bullets from a machine gun. In fact, the exit rate of cells will be faster than bullets from a machine gun.” Construction workers are on the clock 24/7 Per a recent report in The Wall Street Journal, Tesla now employs 1,000 workers who are on the job “seven days a week on two shifts in an effort to start churning out lithium-ion cells by late 2016.” The Gigafactory will run on 100% renewable energy Hardly a surprise, the Gigafactory will be completely powered by renewable energy. As Tesla notes on its website, “the Gigafactory will also be powered by renewable energy sources, with the goal of achieving net zero energy.” The Gigafactory roof is white for environmental reasons Tesla, a green company if there ever was one, is planning to outfit the entire Gigafactory roof with solar panels. In turn, the roof of the structure will be painted white in order to better reflect light, keep things cool, and ensure that the solar panels are as efficient as possible. The building was designed to be earthquake proof You ever spend a few billion on building a gigantic battery factory only to have an earthquake come along and mess things up? Yeah, Tesla would like to avoid that at all costs. According to a recent report in Fast Company, the massive structure is actually comprised of “four distinct structures with four different foundations so that an earthquake can’t tear it apart.” The Gigafactory foundation itself costs millions of dollars The cost of the Gigafactory’s foundation alone set Tesla back $16 million Tesla spent millions on steel The steel structure underlying the Gigafactory itself reportedly cost $15 million. Fireproofing + Electrical wiring Fireproofing the Gigafactory cost an estimated $5 million while the electrical infrastructure reportedly set Tesla back $300,000 The Gigafactory will employ 6,500 employees by 2020 The Gigafactory won’t run itself, which is why the company anticipates that it will employ upwards of 6,500 at the Gigafactory once construction is fully finished.

Photo: AFP Aerospace Industrial Development Corp (AIDC, 漢翔航空工業) is expected to post increased earnings for last quarter due to an improving product mix, Yuanta Securities Investment Consulting Co (元大投顧) said on Saturday. “The company’s gross margins would likely rise from 13.1 percent a year ago to 15 percent, propelled by higher margin overseas defense aircraft contracts,” Yuanta Securities Investment Consulting Co (元大投顧) analyst Livia Wu (吳靚芙) said in a report. “We are also positive on the company’s ability to capture opportunities from a healthy global commercial aircraft market,” Wu said, adding that the company has a backlog of more than NT$100 billion (US$3.17 billion). Amid rising global air passenger numbers, AIDC’s commercial aircraft backlog for Boeing Co reached 5,700 units, while backlog for Airbus Group SE rose 4 percent annually to 6,700 units, Wu said. However, the company is expected to face increased operational expenditures due to rising research and development costs, Wu added. Orders from the Republic of China Air Force for the Indigenous Defense Fighter and F-16 jets is expected to sustain sales growth momentum next year, Wu said. Meanwhile, the government is likely to show a clearer direction regarding a NT$69 billion program to acquire a new fleet of air force trainer jets next month, AIDC management was quoted as saying in the report. The government has been mulling a wholly indigenous development effort or cooperation with a foreign producer. The program would provide a significant revenue stream between 2018 and 2025, Wu said. Wu said the brokerage anticipates a foreign producer, adding that the government is likely to partner with Italian aeronautics company Alenia Aermacchi, which developed the M-346 two-engine transonic trainer aircraft. AIDC reported that last month’s sales increased 6.74 percent sequentially to NT$2.24 billion, with aggregate sales in the first seven months rising 9 percent annually to NT$16.04 billion. Shares of AIDC yesterday gained 0.23 percent to NT$43.4 in Taipei trading. This story has been viewed 2109 times. Comments will be moderated.

The aerospace company told investors on Sunday that the SFO launched a formal probe last month, after discrepancies were first identified by British government officials in April. The SFO and Airbus have confirmed that the investigation concerns “irregularities” in connection with overseas agents in its civil aviation business, but have not disclosed further details.

Airbus first revealed in April that it was in discussions with the SFO over its failure to disclose third-party involvement in deals that received government support.

Such applications are used to aid exporters and often involve underwriting bank loans. In 2015, Airbus used export financing for six percent of its deliveries. A spokesperson for UK Export Finance said: “UKEF continues to work closely with Airbus and French and German export credit agencies to understand the extent of the matter and to seek assurances about its current compliance practices in relation to overseas agents.” The agency said it would “follow closely other UK government agencies’ investigations and respond accordingly.” Airbus executives have indicated they are working to restore financing – a process separate from the fraud investigation. The company has said that it expects financial backing for some exports to be restored before the end of the year.

We also look at how local and state government agencies carry out these laws to see if they are working. But we must focus on the courts, too. Troubling rulings by the Texas Supreme Court and lower courts are watering down the Texas Public Information Act, long considered one of the strongest in the nation. The momentous law, enacted in the early 1970s amid citizen frustration after the Sharpstown stock fraud scandal, is based on the public’s right to know. It presumes government records are open. If a governmental body wants to withhold information, it can attempt to do so using one of the exceptions spelled out in the law. In most cases it must ask the Texas Attorney General’s Office for permission to do it on a case-by-case basis. That said, some cases end up in court, and the Texas Supreme Court twice last year interpreted the law in ways that made it easier to keep information secret. Most Popular 1 Donald Trump called son of slain SAPD Det. Benjamin Marconi,... 2 Exclusive: Accused cop killer Otis McKane married in San... 3 35-point monster whitetail buck shot by hunter near San... The court decided the nonprofit Greater Houston Partnership did not have to open its financial books to the public because it was not a governmental body, even though it performed economic development duties for the city of Houston and was supported in part by public funds. Another disturbing decision involved the aerospace company Boeing operating in San Antonio. The court ruled that a private party doing business with the government can have its information in government documents withheld if releasing it would give advantage to a competitor. Furthermore, governments can now more easily withhold their own information on those grounds. The result? Information is getting closed off in seemingly straightforward cases of public interest, such as the city of McAllen keeping secret how much taxpayer money it paid for singer Enrique Iglesias to perform at a holiday concert. The city says it doesn’t want to be at a competitive disadvantage when negotiating with future entertainers. In the pivotal Texas Supreme Court rulings, Justice Jeffrey Boyd led the dissent, stating specific legal concerns and noting the overarching theme that the Public Information Act declares it “shall be liberally construed in favor of granting a request for information.” He also offered this point: “The necessary corollary is that we must narrowly construe the Act’s exceptions to disclosure.” That makes sense. Presume openness. Limit the withholding of information. Lawsuits affecting public access also are in play in regional state appellate courts. One of them is a pending appeal in Dallas connected to the larger controversy over development at Fair Park. The nonprofit State Fair of Texas sued an attorney who requested its records. The State Fair claimed it’s not a governmental body and not covered by the Public Information Act. A trial court dismissed the case and financially sanctioned the State Fair for filing it. But the State Fair appealed, and a decision could come soon. It raises the question of what if an everyday citizen — without the money to hire an attorney — ended up sued in court simply for asking for information from an entity that’s not covered by the Texas Public Information Act. (Governmental bodies covered by TPIA cannot sue a requester for making a request.) Several other court cases could negatively impact citizen access to information and will be discussed at the Freedom of Information Foundation of Texas state conference Sept. 8 in Austin. Efforts are underway, meanwhile, to further clarify and strengthen the Public Information Act in the 2017 Legislature. It’s hoped that our current state lawmakers, like their predecessors, value open government as a foundation of our democracy. The people’s right to know is at stake. Kelley Shannon is executive director of the nonprofit Freedom of Information Foundation of Texas, which advocates for open government and the First Amendment rights of free speech and press.

Europe's largest aerospace company said late on Sunday it had been notified that the UK's Serious Fraud Office had opened a formal criminal probe after being alerted by the country's export credit agency to discrepancies relating to the disclosure of the work of local agents. The probe raises a sensitive issue for the industry because the agency, UK Export Finance, has for years locked horns with aerospace firms about the need for more transparency, even though it does not object outright to the use of intermediaries. Airbus Group said the SFO was looking into possible "fraud, bribery and corruption" and that the company continued to co-operate with the investigating agency, having itself tipped off UKEF about internal findings under a recent compliance drive. "It will take years," a person familiar with the matter said of the SFO investigation, adding it was too early to predict any outcome or consequences. Airbus Group is already the subject of a four-year-old SFO investigation into a $3.3 billion communications deal with Saudi Arabia, while the SFO is conducting a corruption probe into engine maker Rolls-Royce which it launched in 2013. The latest case involves discrepancies over the amount of agents' fees disclosed in applications for export support, or missing names of third parties, in some cases dating back years, people familiar with the matter have said. In April, UKEF halted export funding pending a compliance review and was swiftly followed by France and Germany. Since 2006, companies applying for export support in Britain have had to identify any intermediaries involved in sales negotiations and list the sums paid. The rules followed a series of policy U-turns and a fierce debate between UKEF and aerospace companies including Airbus, which had lobbied against the tougher disclosure rules on the grounds that such data was commercially sensitive and that their own codes of conduct and due diligence methods were sufficient. Airbus Group shares fell as much as 1.8 percent on Monday, driven by concern over the probe. The longer-term impact may depend upon how widely the probe spreads and the level of managers who signed off on payments that can be worth millions of dollars, as well as the declarations to export agencies, analysts said. A spokesman declined to comment on any details of the investigation beyond Sunday's brief statement. FUNDING RACE In a separate process, Airbus is meanwhile trying to restore export funding from UKEF under a revised compliance scheme. The company said last month it had agreed a process for this and expected export credits to resume in the fourth quarter. But several people familiar with the case say it has deeply soured relations between Airbus and export agencies, notably UKEF, and that much work remains to be done to restore trust. Analysts say the operational impact of this funding gap is limited for now as there is little demand for export credit amid plentiful commercial liquidity. Just 5 percent of Airbus deliveries depended on such support last year. One person familiar with the case told Reuters the onus was on Airbus to prove it had a robust system for preventing abuse. One move being floated to win back confidence is a blanket voluntary ban within Airbus on the use of percentage commissions to third-party sales agents and more careful vetting of any other form of payment, people familiar with the matter said. The move is designed to allay concerns that payments in countries where it is common to have local representatives, which include parts of Asia and the Middle East, could be seen as a potential vehicle for bribery. But it could provide a headache for a company which has openly stated to UK authorities in the past that it relies on a long-established network of representatives to remain competitive, while some will argue that sales commissions are normal across many industries. It could also test often uneasy relations between Airbus and its parent group, whose boss Tom Enders launched the vigorous - some say abrasive - compliance drive under a new legal head. Currently, the playing field with Boeing is level as the corresponding system in the United States is also frozen due to political deadlock which has left the U.S. Export Import (EXIM) Bank without a fully functioning board. But with some U.S. officials predicting EXIM could resume funding for Boeing around the turn of the year, Airbus risks being disadvantaged in some key markets unless it achieves its target of regaining access to European credits by year-end. Although export credits technically only kick in when planes are delivered, aviation market sources say uncertainty over the future supply of credits can hinder efforts to win new orders. French brokerage Kepler Cheuvreux said export credits could be useful for finalising a key order from Iran, which has been held up for regulatory reasons and due to funding uncertainties. But at this stage, the agents affair is likely to have an impact on Airbus's reputation rather than business, it said. Anti-corruption group Transparency International said the probe highlighted the need for openness on the use of agents.

The France-based aerospace company said that the probe ordered by Serious Fraud Office (SFO) related to its civil aviation business and was in connection over use of third-party consultants. Airbus said it was cooperating with the on-going probe, which was launched last month, BBC reported. The firm, which competes with American rival Boeing, had said in April that the SFO and export credit agencies such as UK Export Finance, were informed about the irregularities detected by the aerospace company during an internal probe.  Why advertise with us?

Europe's largest aerospace company said late on Sunday it had been notified that the UK's Serious Fraud Office had opened a formal criminal probe after being alerted by the country's export credit agency to discrepancies relating to the disclosure of the work of local agents. The probe raises a sensitive issue for the industry because the agency, UK Export Finance, has for years locked horns with aerospace firms about the need for more transparency, even though it does not object outright to the use of intermediaries. Airbus Group said the SFO was looking into possible "fraud, bribery and corruption" and that the company continued to co-operate with the investigating agency, having itself tipped off UKEF about internal findings under a recent compliance drive. "It will take years," a person familiar with the matter said of the SFO investigation, adding it was too early to predict any outcome or consequences. Airbus Group is already the subject of a four-year-old SFO investigation into a $3.3 billion communications deal with Saudi Arabia, while the SFO is conducting a corruption probe into engine maker Rolls-Royce which it launched in 2013. The latest case involves discrepancies over the amount of agents' fees disclosed in applications for export support, or missing names of third parties, in some cases dating back years, people familiar with the matter have said. In April, UKEF halted export funding pending a compliance review and was swiftly followed by France and Germany. Since 2006, companies applying for export support in Britain have had to identify any intermediaries involved in sales negotiations and list the sums paid. The rules followed a series of policy U-turns and a fierce debate between UKEF and aerospace companies including Airbus, which had lobbied against the tougher disclosure rules on the grounds that such data was commercially sensitive and that their own codes of conduct and due diligence methods were sufficient. Airbus Group shares fell as much as 1.8 percent on Monday, driven by concern over the probe. The longer-term impact may depend upon how widely the probe spreads and the level of managers who signed off on payments that can be worth millions of dollars, as well as the declarations to export agencies, analysts said. A spokesman declined to comment on any details of the investigation beyond Sunday's brief statement. FUNDING RACE In a separate process, Airbus is meanwhile trying to restore export funding from UKEF under a revised compliance scheme. The company said last month it had agreed a process for this and expected export credits to resume in the fourth quarter. But several people familiar with the case say it has deeply soured relations between Airbus and export agencies, notably UKEF, and that much work remains to be done to restore trust. Analysts say the operational impact of this funding gap is limited for now as there is little demand for export credit amid plentiful commercial liquidity. Just 5 percent of Airbus deliveries depended on such support last year. One person familiar with the case told Reuters the onus was on Airbus to prove it had a robust system for preventing abuse. One move being floated to win back confidence is a blanket voluntary ban within Airbus on the use of percentage commissions to third-party sales agents and more careful vetting of any other form of payment, people familiar with the matter said. The move is designed to allay concerns that payments in countries where it is common to have local representatives, which include parts of Asia and the Middle East, could be seen as a potential vehicle for bribery. But it could provide a headache for a company which has openly stated to UK authorities in the past that it relies on a long-established network of representatives to remain competitive, while some will argue that sales commissions are normal across many industries. It could also test often uneasy relations between Airbus and its parent group, whose boss Tom Enders launched the vigorous - some say abrasive - compliance drive under a new legal head. Currently, the playing field with Boeing is level as the corresponding system in the United States is also frozen due to political deadlock which has left the U.S. Export Import (EXIM) Bank without a fully functioning board. But with some U.S. officials predicting EXIM could resume funding for Boeing around the turn of the year, Airbus risks being disadvantaged in some key markets unless it achieves its target of regaining access to European credits by year-end. Although export credits technically only kick in when planes are delivered, aviation market sources say uncertainty over the future supply of credits can hinder efforts to win new orders. French brokerage Kepler Cheuvreux said export credits could be useful for finalizing a key order from Iran, which has been held up for regulatory reasons and due to funding uncertainties. But at this stage, the agents affair is likely to have an impact on Airbus's reputation rather than business, it said. Anti-corruption group Transparency International said the probe highlighted the need for openness on the use of agents.

Picture: Hannah McKay Chicago - Airbus Group SE said the UK Serious Fraud Office has opened a criminal investigation into allegations of fraud, bribery and corruption relating to some of its third-party consultants. Read also: Airbus bags Asian deals The Toulouse, France-based planemaker said in a statement on Sunday that it’s co-operating with investigators probing its civil aviation business. Airbus had flagged to UK regulators and the European Export Credit Agencies earlier this year “misstatements and omissions” involving the outside contractors in some export financing applications, which it found through an internal probe. The credit agencies, including UK Export Finance, have suspended some of the backstop financing that Airbus uses to help sell commercial aircraft since the first revelations made four months ago. Airbus said in a July 27 statement that a process for re-establishing export credit “has been agreed and is ongoing”. Until the financing is restored, Airbus and rival Boeing face the challenge of navigating an uncertain market with limited government assistance. Chicago-based Boeing has been unable to tap trade financing because a congressional impasse has left the US Export-Import bank with too few directors to approve deals. Jefferies Equity Research estimates that export-credit agencies last year provided 7 percent of financing for Airbus plane deliveries, compared with 45 percent from leasing companies and 40 percent from airlines themselves. The Airbus investigation adds to the scrutiny of the role played by cross-border intermediaries. Monaco-based Unaoil SAM, which served as a go-between for companies and officials in the Middle East, Africa and former Soviet countries, was searched by authorities earlier this year amid allegations of corruption. “This will have some negative impact,” said Shukor Yusof, founder of aviation consulting firm Endau Analytics in Malaysia. “Third-party consultants or intermediaries have often caused worries. The business of aircraft sale is so intense and competitive that there are people trying many avenues.” Airbus said in the July 27 filing that it’s undertaking a sweeping review involving “legal, investigative, and forensic accounting” of consultants and other third parties used to support sales. The European planemaker said it’s also using greater due diligence to screen potential contractors. “The group cannot exclude that the comprehensive review and these enhancements of its controls and practices lead to additional commercial disputes or other consequences in the future,” the filing said.   * With assistance from Kyunghee Park BLOOMBERG Like us on Facebook Connect with us on LinkedIn Hungry for more business news?

By Ananya Roy August 8, 2016 07:34 BST Close Embed Feed Barack Obama: Iran payment was not 'some nefarious deal' Reuters <iframe src="http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/videos/embed/19778" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe> Iranian Airlines is planning to procure 20 Japanese aircraft, with a deal expected to be finalised in December when a delegation from Tokyo is scheduled to visit Tehran for the purpose. The jets will be acquired through a lease-purchase contract, an Iranian minister said. Asghar Fakhrieh Kashan, deputy minister for international affairs at the ministry of road and urban development, said the 100-seat Mitsubishi Regional Jet (MRJ), manufactured by a unit of Japan's Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, will be purchased as part of the deal for Iranian domestic carrier Aseman Airlines. The minister said as the Iranian carrier operates in the domestic and provincial flight sector across the country, the MRJ remains a viable option, Iran's Mehr News Agency reported. He added that a second working group will pursue negotiations in Tehran in December. Iran has already signed a $27bn (21bn) draft agreement with Airbus for the purchase of 118 jets. These include 45 A320 single-aisle aircraft, 45 A330 wide-bodied aircraft, 16 A350 twin-aisle aircraft, and 12 A380 jets, the news agency reported. Iran is planning to buy 20 Mitsubishi Regional Jet aircraft from Japan to renew its ageing domestic airlinerReuters Kashan said the country was in talks with several aircraft manufacturers to strengthen its domestic fleets. Iran wants to buy small ATR aircraft in order to "activate and economise numerous small airports inside the country", the minister said. Reuters reported that Iran has signed draft deals with Boeing and Airbus worth around $50bn for the purchase of about 200 new aircraft. These deals have been possible because of the lifting of sanctions against Tehran following the nuclear agreement. ATR is a French-Italian aircraft manufacturer headquartered in France and is a subsidiary of the French Airbus Group. The company primarily manufactures the ATR 42 and ATR 72 aircraft.

The manufacturer of the A320 and A380 said the probe by the U.K. Serious Fraud Office is connected to the use of third-party consultants by its passenger aircraft business. Airbus said it discovered “misstatements and omissions” in information it provided about the consultants in applications for export financing for some of its customers. The company, which competes with Boeing around the world, announced in April it notified the Serious Fraud Office and export credit agencies about the irregularities it had found. It said Sunday it’s cooperating with the U.K. investigation. Export credit financing typically takes the form of loans and insurance provided to companies to help them cover the risks of selling products overseas. After Airbus reported the irregularities earlier this year, export credit agencies in Europe halted some of the financing to the company. The plane maker said last month it’s aiming to get the financing restored by the fourth quarter of this year. Airbus also said it’s carrying out a wide-ranging review of its relationships with third-party consultants.

Business News Home > Business > Business News < Back to SMG 45 Monday, 8 August 2016 ‘Pride of Africa’ tries to stop a long fall Kenya Airways planes are seen parked at the Jomo Kenyatta International airport near Kenyas capital Nairobi, April 28, 2016. Picture taken April 28, 2016. REUTERS Kenya Airways makes big loss but changes showing results NAIROBI: When Kenya Airways published the country’s worst-ever corporate results last month, the scale of the loss revealed the effects of several disastrous decisions that the national carrier is struggling to reverse. The airline’s “Pride of Africa” slogan rang uncomfortably hollow when the 26.22-billion-shilling (US$259mil) loss was announced, driven by higher borrowing costs and unfavourable exchange rates. Kenya Airways, founded in 1977 following the demise of East African Airways, was considered a cash cow just a decade ago, but is now floundering, said independent analyst Aly-Khan Satchu.“In the history of Kenya, no other listed company has ever recorded such an important loss,” Satchu said. A misguided expansion strategy launched in 2011 is the root of the catastrophic state of the firm, a move that called for the purchase of new Boeing planes with the objective of doubling the size of its network. But since then the Ebola virus and terror attacks on the continent have decimated Africa’s tourist numbers, while rivals such as state-owned Ethiopian Airlines and Qatar Airways have boosted their offerings. The firm has also lost out on rock-bottom fuel prices. Like many airlines, it “hedges” its fuel costs by entering into a fixed-price contracts. But Kenya Airways was locked into longer term contracts than most of its competitors, which gained a competitive advantage as fuel prices have plunged since mid-2014. Foreign currency “and fuel hedging are exceptional items, yes, but a company like KQ (Kenya Airways) should be able to deal with this,” said Satchu about the airline’s latest results. To the dismay of Kenya Airways’ two biggest backers – Air France-KLM and the Kenyan government – the firm’s share price has dropped from 140 shillings in 2006 to 3.85 shillings. The company’s debts exceed a billion dollars. Despite the gloom, analysts still see some cause for optimism in the numbers. Revenue was up 5% and operating losses shrank thanks to a series of shock treatments imposed on the airline by management last year.“The operational result is what I’ll take from the latest results,” said Eric Musau, analyst at Kenya’s Standard Investment Bank. “KQ is on the right track, even if they could do a bit more in terms of assets sales,” he told AFP, describing the net loss as largely down to exceptional factors. A number of structural changes are beginning to show fruit. Kenya Airways has sold or rented out planes that were sitting idle, reducing its fleet size by a third, and has rid itself of an expensive permanent landing slot at London’s Heathrow airport, opting to rent one instead. The fleet and those who fly it are in the sights of chief executive Mbuvi Ngunze. “The first thing that we are doing now is making sure that we get our business at the right size in order to grow responsibly, and that right size is both revenue and costs,” he said. Ngunze announced in March the airline will cut 600 jobs out of its 4,000-strong workforce. – AFP Tags / Keywords: Foreign News , kenya You May Be Interested FGV falls in active trade after weak results, KLCI down Yew Sin-Ee Yi continue fine run in Hong Kong Pokémon Go: Dittos are hiding in plain sight Fraud in Felda Global Ventures Rejuvenate yourself with American ginseng Apple issues recall on September, October 2015 iPhone 6S Others Also Read Italian police hope for Christmas reunion between migrant child and mother M’sia, Thailand to begin talks on Bangkok-KL HSR project - Thai Minister Japan enlists Sailor Moon to promote safe sex Property Related advertisement Latest News Brexit fallout to cost UK extra £122bil over five years Industrials lift Dow to record, techs drag S&P and Nasdaq (Update 1) Iraq willing to cut oil output in Opec’s plan to boost prices - PM FGV confirms probe is on Felda Iffco’s subsidiary Healthcare stocks drag Wall Street lower Most Viewed in Business Fraud in Felda Global Ventures M’sia, Thailand to begin talks on Bangkok-KL HSR project - Thai Minister Malakoff seeks RM785mil compensation from EPCC contractors of Tg Bin plant Petronas able to reduce costs with Blue Ocean Strategy Brexit fallout to cost UK extra £122bil over five years FGV confirms probe is on Felda Iffco’s subsidiary Iraq willing to cut oil output in Opec’s plan to boost prices - PM Ringgit opens easier on weak sentiment With US$3b port, Malacca eyes slice of shipping giant Singapore's pie Bank Negara keeps OPR unchanged at 3% advertisement advertisement site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Lifestyle Tech Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services Magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs Advertising View Our Rate Card Policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu StarProperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com Search The Star Online   Connect with us Content Partner Our Radio Stations site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Tech Lifestyle Travel Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs advertising View Our Rate Card policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu starproperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com social media Facebook Twitter Copyright © 1995- Star Media Group Berhad (ROC 10894D)

(Jacob Barker/CBC) A U.S. Air Force plane sometimes used to transport the vice-president touched down in Happy Valley-Goose Bay today. The plane — which is known as Air Force Two when being used by the American vice-president — landed in the early afternoon, and reportedly took off and landed more than once. The plane is a Boeing C-32, a modification of Boeing's 757 passenger aircraft, and is regularly used by the vice-president of the United States, as well as the first lady and the secretary of state. The plane has also been used by presidents when landing at smaller airports that can't accommodate the jumbo jets used as Air Force One. U.S. Air Force officials were mum about who was on board as well as the purpose of the stop.  With files from Jacob Barker.

By AndyPasztor Despite efforts to foster competition for launching Pentagon spacecraft, senior Air Force and intelligence officials aren’t ready to launch their biggest, most advanced spy satellites on top of Space Exploration Technologies Corp.’s Falcon 9 rockets. With the beefed-up Falcon 9 not expected to be certified for military missions until 2017 at the earliest, Pentagon brass have opted for the familiar, though substantially more expensive, option of continuing to put such satellites on proven rockets built by the incumbent rival to SpaceX, as the Southern California company is called. That’s the upshot of the U.S. military’s decision to move toward awarding a pair of sole-source launch contracts to United Launch Alliance, a joint venture between Boeing Co. BA, +0.00%   and Lockheed Martin Corp. LMT, -0.20%   United Launch builds heavy-lift Delta IV rockets that have been the mainstay of the Pentagon’s National Reconnaissance Office, in addition to other boosters for smaller payloads. Announced last week, the decision covers spy-satellite launches slated between 2020 and 2023. Closely held SpaceX, founded by billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk, in the past has pushed hard to be able to compete for Pentagon launches across the board, even filing suit against the Air Force two years ago to protest being shut out of such business. The litigation was dropped after Pentagon officials pledged to open up competition for future launch contracts. An expanded version of this report appears on WSJ.com.

Meet the Contributors → WA State’s Healthcare Transformation Checkup: How Are We Feeling Today? Opinion Rob Arnold Opinion August 9th, 2016 @xconomy Like Us Xconomy Seattle —  We all know (or should know by now) that healthcare is undergoing a historic transformation into a digital consumer service. Consumers will soon expect to comparison shop health providers the same as they would for travel, banking, real estate or consumer goods. Health providers that develop the right formula of value—publishing reference pricing and outcomes data, for example—and innovation—such as next-gen health and wellness tools and precision medical treatments—stand to make the biggest gains. As impressive as all these upcoming technical innovations are, consumers are simultaneously speeding towards staggeringly expensive healthcare costs and high-deductible health plans. So which is more important to healthcare stakeholders, technological innovations or cost control? Can the former lead to the latter? As this new healthcare innovation world reveals itself, it’s increasingly clear that healthcare stakeholders need to view innovations through a “quad aim” prism of lowered costs, improved care, as well as more satisfied patients and providers at the same time. Innovations that fail to hit the quad aim, at least in the short term, may have a very difficult time making it to market. Consumers, governments, and employers need to keep the pressure on to make sure quad aim healthcare benefits are realized. Data transparency for things such as reference pricing for services, care outcomes, and consumer satisfaction information are essential to successful healthcare transformation. According to Bessemer Venture Partners, this consumer, digital transformation of healthcare will result in $1 trillion of economic value changing hands. There’s a lot at stake, and much to gain for communities that get this right. Given the Seattle region’s world class expertise in consumer engagement (Amazon, Starbucks, Costco), cloud computing (Amazon and Microsoft), and life science research (University of Washington, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, the Institute for Systems Biology, Allen Institute for Brain Science, and many others), I’ve been wondering how our region compares to other innovation clusters pursuing this opportunity. For this analysis, I reviewed five primary activities in our State: Life science research: Are we creating new care models and tools? Health system/insurance engagement: Are the health systems and insurers engaged and committed to testing, validating, and scaling new models? Government/employer engagement: Are our state and local governments and large employers providing incentives to drive innovation forward? Startups and innovation investments: Do we have the entrepreneurs and investment capital needed to exploit opportunities and create next-generation healthcare jobs? People and education: Do we have people with the passion, know-how, and expertise to deliver this precision health and medicine future? Here’s what I’ve learned so far. Life science research: Our state ranks 13th in research funding according to Research America. According to Genetic Engineering News, UW ranks fourth in NIH funding. Grade: A—Clearly life science research continues to be a bright spot in our state. Health system/insurance engagement: I reviewed programs currently under development at Cambia Grove, Providence Innovation Center and Fund, UW, and Puget Sound High Value Network. Cambia and Providence were the two first movers in our area to develop an innovation agenda. Both programs have a lot to share about the opportunities and challenges with healthcare innovation. Although both programs offer great potential, it’s hard to assess what kind of impact they will ultimately have at this early stage. UW Medicine is paying close attention to innovation and is experimenting with programs such as palliative care, telemedicine, and the recently launched Primary Care Innovation Lab. The Puget Sound High Value Network is a new entrant with innovation on the agenda. They have a great opportunity to make an impact in care coordination as well as develop innovations for use in their network. We’ll see how this story unfolds. To get a sense of where Washington ranks in terms of healthcare costs, we still fall in the middle of the pack (ranked 27th in the nation) although some systems are reporting they’ve been able to reduce costs back to 2009 rates which is very encouraging. Grade: Too early to grade Government/employer engagement: For this analysis, I looked into the state’s $65 million, five-year award to set up an Accountable Care Network funded by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. Since CMS pays 20 cents of every healthcare dollar (total government healthcare spending is 65 cents of every dollar), they have a vested interest in ensuring quad aim innovations are successful. CMS is actively accelerating innovations related to: broad payment and practice reform in primary care and specialty care; care coordination between providers of services and suppliers; community-based health teams to support chronic care management; and, improved quality and reduced cost through collaborations that support practice transformation. Although this work is still fairly new in Washington, there is growing evidence that this program is on the right track with health systems in eastern and central Washington. I’ve also been very impressed with the work of the state-sponsored Bree Collaborative. Bree Collaborative was formed in 2011 by request of then-Gov. Christine Gregoire to look for ways to improve the quality, consistency, and cost effectiveness of care. On the employer side, The Boeing Company has certainly been forward thinking about the accountable care organization model, and the City of Kirkland is pushing forward with value-based primary care through Vera Whole Health. Grade: B Startups and innovation investments: This topic continues to be good news/bad news for Washington State. The good news is that we do have some real innovators in our community. To name a few, companies like Juno and Adaptive Biotechnologies are leading the way in biotech. Accolade, Limeade, Vera Whole Health, and Arivale are taking on healthcare care transformation. And IT innovators such as Carena Health, TransformativeMed, and Clario Medical—the latter two are clients of my consulting firm—are working hard to improve clinical service specialties. Established funds such as Arch Venture Partners, Maveron, Cambia Health Solutions, Providence Ventures, and Columbia Pacific Management continue to lead the way on new investments. We are also seeing new funds and angel groups forming such as Dave Chases’s QuadAim Fund and Tobin Arthur’s AngelMD. Additionally, we’re seeing more investment activities coming from UW, Fred Hutch, ISB, and support for innovation in the South Sound at Madigan Army Medical Center, UW Tacoma, and MultiCare. On the national funding stage, Washington state companies didn’t fare as well. Only 5 percent of the funding from the top 20 healthcare technology investors ended up here (at least as of the end of 2014). This may be in part that our innovation portfolio is not far enough down the commercialization track to warrant bigger investment dollars. It may also be that our local companies are not pitching the larger investment funds. Either way, there seems to be a disconnection between our high volume of research funding and our low commercialization output. Grade: C+—I know our community is capable of better work! People and education: For this analysis, I reviewed our local startups, their employee base, and funding stage with the help of Kevin Cable at Cascadia Capital. I also researched and met with our local educational institutions developing new curriculum aimed at educating next-generation entrepreneurs, digital marketing experts, and sales professionals. This is another good news/bad news story for our region. The good news is that I continue to be impressed with the smart, talented, and motivated individuals I’ve met at UW programs such as Engineering in Medicine and the Healthcare Innovation Challenge. We have incredible talent coming through the pipeline. The bad news is that healthcare innovation job opportunities are still lacking and I’m worried the talent we are educating might not stay here. We also seem to fall short on the fully engaged, “been there/done that” commercialization professionals needed to take products to market. The shortage of experienced people and capital seem correlated. We need a bigger, bolder innovation pipeline to attract the later stage talent and capital we need for our region to compete on a national level. Grade: C+ Summary Recommendations: We have potential for quick wins with government/employer incentives and health systems opening up to more pilot innovations: More incentive dollars from governments and employers could move quad aim innovation faster in our health systems. It’s important to remember that federal incentives paid for health records to be digitized. We are now at 99 percent coverage. Incentives do work. In exchange for more incentives, I would push for transparent and easy access to reference pricing and outcomes data to make sure consumers can make informed choices on where they get affordable, high-quality care. I would also love to see our Washington health systems learn how to run pilot tests more efficiently. Philadelphia, Nashville, and Chicago are forging ahead in this area. We should study those models and apply those lessons quickly. We also need to work much harder to convince startups, commercialization professionals, and investors that Washington State is a credible place to create and grow a successful healthcare business. To accomplish this, we need better coordination between state government, employers, health systems, and insurers committed to testing, purchasing and scaling quad aim innovations such as software, devices, diagnostics, and drugs. I have no doubt with better coordination and better aligned incentives, we can attract great startups, investors, and commercialization professionals to our community. When innovation and commercialization are done right, we know the payoff for our region will pay dividends for decades to come.

A mirror inspection of the James Webb Space Telescope, scheduled to launch in 2018. Credit: NASA/David Higginbotham What's happening in our universe? In the 400 years since we first started using telescopes, we've been trying to answer this question. The past two decades alone have been dizzying: Planets found outside the solar system, a universe accelerating in its expansion, and hints of the mysterious dark energy and dark matter that make up most of the universe, to name a handful of historic discoveries. But to see further, we often need to spend big. RELATED: Covers Off! Say Hello to Our Future Mega-Space Telescope There's been much coverage of the more than $9 billion James Webb Space Telescope that will launch in 2018, to probe planetary atmospheres and to look back at the universe's beginnings. What will come next? Looking a bit ahead, the astronomy organization AURA suggests a "High Definition Space Telescope" to launch in 2035, an observatory double Webb's size. But how this would be paid for comes under scrutiny in a new report. Harvard astrophysicist Martin Elvis' new paper in Space Policy to try to solve what he calls the astronomy "funding wall." Our hunger for greater telescopes in X-ray emissions alone, he argues, has made the cost of this mission type increase 20 times in the past generation. (Yes, that's after adjusting for inflation.) Moreover, space missions often go over their budget before launch. "At some point the costs are more than a government can abide," he wrote. "Particle physics hit its funding wall in the U.S. when the Superconducting Super-Collider, already far along in construction in Texas, went over budget one too many times and was cancelled. Is astronomy next?" The Hubble Space Telescope is still operational after more than 25 years in space, but it won't last forever. The telescope was designed to be serviced by the now-defunct space shuttle program.Credit: NASA JWST may already be testing the limits, he added. Its cost growth led to repeated threats of cancellation, but the mission has been replanned to try to avoid this. Elvis said that NASA has a budget of just $5 billion per decade for large new space telescopes. "Each JWST-class mission thus takes 100% of nearly 20 years of this funding line," he said, pointing out the successor mission of the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST) could be similar in cost to JWST. What Can Giant Telescopes Teach Us About Our Universe? He also worries that focusing on a single, large telescope will make NASA's program lose its robustness. Right now we have three "Great Observatories" -- the Hubble Space Telescope, the Spitzer space telescope, and the Chandra X-Ray Observatory -- operating in different wavelengths: visual, infrared and X-ray. We need to study the same object in different wavelengths to properly understand it. The youngest of these telescopes is 13 years old and will eventually fail during JWST's lifetime; JWST is most sensitive in infrared and follow-up observations in X-rays, Elvis argues, would need to wait. RELATED: Top 10 Astronomical Discoveries Of All Time But before worrying overmuch, Elvis proposes a solution: to depend more on the commercial space sector. Think about how much it has changed human spaceflight in the last decade. Now we have regular cargo runs to the International Space Station; in SpaceX's case, occasionally these missions have been able to land their rockets for future re-use. And very soon, SpaceX and Boeing will be sending astronauts aloft on their own spacecraft. What is the prospect for astronomy? NASA is trying to learn more about the universe to, in part, figure out the conditions for breeding life. At left is an artist's conception of Earth, compared with an artist's conception of the faraway Kepler-452b (a rocky planet bigger than Earth).Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech/T. Pyle He argues that commercial spacecraft (which are more likely to see cost driven down by competition) would see quick advances in a few areas. Costs in launch, spacecraft and payloads would reduce, mainly because we are making a lot of advances today to reduce the mass hefted to orbit. In space, mass is one of the major costs. "Cutting spacecraft cost by a factor 2, along with launch costs by a factor 3, would roughly halve the cost of a flagship mission," he said. "This would radically alter flagship mission decisions, by doubling the number that could be launched each decade." RELATED: Can Future Telescopes See The Edge Of The Universe? Elvis also argues that as private tourists spend time in orbit, the demand would lower the cost for low-Earth orbit missions and provide more access for astronomers. How this would be done still needs to be worked out (the Bigelow module on the space station has no platform for telescopes, for example.) More locations could open up across the solar system with private lunar landers and asteroid prospectors, too. You can read about these arguments, and Elvis' vision for spaceflight in the 2020s and beyond as we expand across the solar system, in his paper "What can Space Resources do for Astronomy and Planetary Science?" current events space telescope jwst james webb space telescope astronomy space telescopes MUST WATCH THE MUST reads One Second of Bad Data Doomed Mars Lander Gorillas Have Been Caught Engaging in 'Mob Violence' The Race to Save the World’s Biggest Trees WWII Shipwrecks 'Vanish' After Plundering by Illegal Scavengers Some Pigs Are Optimists, Others Pessimists MORE amazing stories World Exploration Science Shows Discovery Digital Networks Animalist DeFranco Network DNews Revision3 Seeker SourceFed Corporate About Us Discovery Communications Viewer Relations Advertising Careers @ Discovery Privacy Policy Online Closed Captioning Visitor Agreement Copyright © 2016 Discovery Communications, LLC.

By Ananya Roy August 9, 2016 08:09 BST Close Embed Feed Malaysia Airlines MH370 search to be suspended Reuters <iframe src="http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/videos/embed/19485" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe> The doomed Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 could have dropped from a height of 35,000ft at a speed of up to 20,000ft a minute before it finally crashed into the southern Indian Ocean, analysis of automated flight signals from the missing aircraft showed. The chief of the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) has said the findings corroborate the assumption that the plane could be located in the designated 120,000sq km seafloor. Defence scientists thoroughly studied the automated signals — dubbed handshakes — sent by the missing flight during its final moments to a satellite linked to a ground station in Perth and found that the plane crashed into the sea after running out of fuel. They also found that its two engines burst out — the first was the left engine followed by the right, which flamed out in the next 15 minutes. Pointing to the new theories that have surfaced in the resent past that the pilot of the plane, Zaharie Ahmad Shah, could have glided the plane farther away from the designated search area, MH370 search programme director Peter Foley said the search location was not ascertained based on theories, but on "hard facts" found following months of analysis of signals transmitted by the flight. The automated signal system, which is designed to provide data about the status of airplane parts like engines, reportedly indicated that just after midnight on 8 March, 2014, MH370 took off from Kuala Lumpur and headed for Beijing, with "goodnight" being the last heard radio message from the crew. Signals picked up by Malaysian military radar showed the aircraft making two turns that took it back over the Malaysian Peninsula. But there was further evidence that pointed to at least one more turn that the plane took at the northwest tip of Sumatra towards the southern Indian Ocean, which was most likely made by the conscious pilot. Seven automated connections received from the flight helped investigators ascertain that the missing Boeing 777 was still flying long after it lost contact with ground control office. Two satellite phone calls made to the plane after it went off radar went unanswered, but defence scientists confirmed the plane was heading south at that time, the Australian reported. Investigators said automated signals from the missing MH370 flight showed it fell from a height of 35,000ft at a very high speedReuters It was the seventh signal that was out of sequence and helped investigators conclude that the plane ran out of fuel from that instant and one of its two engines flamed out. ATSB chief commissioner Greg Hood said the analysis of these automated signals back the investigators' theory that the plane was not manned and crashed into the ocean following fuel exhaustion. He added that extensive testing by Boeing concluded that the plane dived from 35,000ft at a speed ranging between 12,000 and 20,000ft per minute. However, an aircraft making a normal landing descends at a speed of 2,000ft a minute. The defence scientists also found that the crash took place at 8.19am (WA time) on 9 March, 2014, since when the Beijing-bound plane with 238 passengers and crew members has remained untraceable. Foley told The Australian that a Defence Science and Technology Group team headed by Neil Gordon was a crucial part of the search team. He added that the ATSB had always kept an open mind with regard to the MH370 search.

It would be recalled that the United Kingdom’s (UK) Serious Fraud Office recently opened a criminal investigation into allegations of fraud, bribery and corruption relating to some of its third-party consultants. In Nigeria, First Nation Airline uses Airbus plane on its domestic routes.Olaitan said that such allegations were meant to be resolved in a manner that it would not impact on the production line and bookings by airlines, given the significant role they play in an economy. However, founder of aviation consulting firm, Endau Analytics, Malaysia, Shukor Yusof, said that the investigations would have negative impact.“Third-party consultants or intermediaries have often caused worries. The business of aircraft sale is so intense and competitive that there are people trying many avenues,” he said. The Toulouse, France-based plane maker said in a statement that it would cooperate with investigators probing its civil aviation business. Airbus had flagged to UK regulators and the European Export Credit Agencies earlier this year “misstatements and omissions” involving the outside contractors in some export financing applications, which it found through an internal probe. The credit agencies, including UK Export Finance have suspended some of the backstop financing that Airbus uses to help sell commercial aircraft since the first revelations made four months ago. Airbus said in a July 27 statement that a process for re-establishing export credit “has been agreed and is ongoing.” Until the financing is restored, Airbus and rival Boeing Co. face the challenge of navigating an uncertain market with limited government assistance. Chicago-based Boeing has been unable to tap trade financing because a congressional impasse has left the U.S. Export-Import bank with too few directors to approve deals. Jefferies Equity Research estimates that export-credit agencies last year provided seven per cent of financing for Airbus plane deliveries, compared with 45 per cent from leasing companies and 40 per cent from airlines themselves.

Doomed Malaysian Airlines flight MH370 has been found to have taken a catastrophic dive, extensive analysis by defence scientists has revealed. Defence scientists' theory fits with analysis of the signals sent out automatically between the aircraft and satellites. In the aircraft's final moments it is understood to have taken a plunge falling 20,000 feet a minute before plowing in to the Indian Ocean off Western Australia. Briefings by the aircraft's manfacturer Boeing indicate the plane would have slowed and lost lift once the engine power was lost, with the nose of the plane dipping, peaking briefly and then descending, the Australian Business Review reported. The Australian reported that a series of briefings revealed this process would have happened a few times before the aircraft dove nose-first in a "fugoid motion in a series of downward swoops". Scientist's believe the impact would have been catastrophic. Little wreckage of the missing aircraft has been found since it slipped off aviation radars in 2014. - NZ Herald By Aimee Shaw Email Print Get the news delivered straight to your inbox Receive the day’s news, sport and entertainment in our daily email newsletter SIGN UP NOW Loading Currency Compare and convert world currencies.

The Mehr News agency quoted Fakhrieh Kashan on Sunday as saying that the deal was likely to be finalised when a Japanese delegation visits Tehran in December. The aircraft will be acquired through a lease-purchase contract and will be used by Aseman Airlines on domestic routes, Fakhrieh Khashan said. The lifting of long-standing economic sanctions against Iran in exchange for curbs on its nuclear activities has allowed it to strike provisional deals worth around $50 billion with Boeing and Airbus to buy some 200 airliners to renew its ageing fleet. However, financial and political obstacles have continued to dog the deals, and Iran has made clear it is widening its search to include other suppliers.

 YOUR E-MAIL VERIFICATION CODE Britain's Serious Fraud Office said on Sunday it had opened a criminal probe into Airbus Group, investigating allegations of fraud, bribery and corruption. "These allegations relate to irregularities concerning third party consultants," the SFO said in a statement. The authority said it opened the investigation in July and asked anyone with relevant information to come forward. A spokesperson for the SFO said additional details of the probe would not be made public until charges were brought or the investigation is dropped. European planemaker Airbus said it was aware of the probe and the aviation firm was working with investigators. The company was informed on Friday that the authority had launched an investigation, an Airbus spokesman told AFP. Airbus informed authorities of the irregularities in April. The same month the U.K. Export Finance decided to suspend export credits to the firm, a move followed by France and Germany. The aviation firm said at the time it hoped to resolve the financing problem as soon as possible. The current SFO investigation is expected to take years. The probe was described by the Financial Times newspaper as a "severe blow to the European aircraft maker," which would be exploited by its U.S. rival Boeing. Airbus is the largest commercial aerospace company in Britain and last month said its net profit rose 15 percent in the first half of the year. Profits were up 1.76 billion euros, but the gain was due to exceptional items that masked a slide in operating earnings. The company was hit by charges of just over 1 billion euros related to its troubled A400M military cargo transporter program, while adverse currency movements and charges on its widebody A350 aircraft totaled nearly 900 million. However these were compensated for by the sale of shares in Dassault Aviation and the creation of a rocket launcher joint venture with Safran that generated a net gain of nearly 1.9 billion euros. Ahead of British voters' decision in June to leave the EU, Airbus said it would reconsider future investment in the country if the referendum took the U.K. out of Europe. "Airbus Group's success in the U.K. is predicated on a highly competitive, integrated European business model," executives said in a letter sent to employees in April.

The Huntington Beach teen just graduated from Marina High with the distinction of having attended every day of school since kindergarten. We sat down with this motivated young man to find out how he did it, and why. Q. Has it been difficult to go to school every single day since you started kindergarten? A. Yes, sometimes. Especially if I was feeling under the weather, extremely exhausted from an intense workout, or stayed up late studying and had very little sleep. I just got up early so that I wasn't rushing, drank lots of water because that makes your body function better, and ate a healthy breakfast even if I wasn't hungry. I would also bring some treats to school to keep my energy up. I was so proud when, on Honors Night, our school principal Dr. Marion started off by telling the audience about a special young man who had done something unusual and had never missed a day of school for 13 years. Many people in the audience started chanting my name and looking at me. I was told later that I received a standing ovation as I walked to the platform. Then, the principal mentioned that there was one student who had never missed a day of school during the graduation speech. I felt honored. Q. What did you say to yourself when you just didn't want to go to school? A. I motivated myself day by day. I just told myself it's another day, so time to get up. I am a self-starter, and knew that only I could motivate myself and accomplish this goal. No one very made me go to school. I've always loved school, and had many good teachers. I also like being able to see and hang out with my sports and ASB friends every day. I am a punctual person. I don't like waiting around when nothing is happening, or missing something if I had been late. My perfect attendance goal was initially the motivation I had from my two older sisters. They're both quite successful in reaching their goals. My oldest sister Stephanie had the same perfect attendance goal, and she lasted from kindergarten through 10th grade. My sister Jennifer had perfect attendance from kindergarten up to half of 11th grade. This made me want to try as well, but I wasn't quite sure I could do it. Q. What kept you busy at school and at home? A. My favorite subject was math, especially AP calculus. My least favorite subject was Spanish, though I enjoyed the teacher. I played sports at Marina, and was on varsity in basketball, volleyball, and track and field. I was also in ASB leadership as commissioner of technology, and campus clubs like the Surf Rider Foundation. I like things away from school, too, like watching the Space Channel with my dad occasionally, since he is a rocket scientist at the Boeing Corporation. I have a sweet tooth. I am always snacking, and I especially like dessert every night after dinner. It's kind of a joke in our family how mechanical I seem to be. I love to fix broken things, repair and build things at our house. I like spending time with my mom, Diane, dad, Jim, my two older sisters, our black lab, and four cats. Q. What's next for you? A. I'll be attending California State University Long Beach. I was accepted into their School of Engineering. I was accepted into quite a few other schools too, but after I researched their School of Engineering, I like that it is highly ranked, and many of the firms I would want to work for after graduation recruit from CSULB Engineering. It seemed like the best fit to stay local for a few years, and I've already been researching these company internship programs. I want to be an aerospace engineer or a civil engineer. Q. Away from school are you always on time? A. Yes, I am always on time even away from school. One of my freshman basketball coaches once told us when we made the team “if you are 15 minutes early, then you are on time, and if you arrive on time then you are late.” I found this kind of intimidating when I first heard it as a freshman, but later found it to be a good point. My grandpa used to always say “every day is a good day, and some days are even better.” I always try to live by that because he was always a happy, generous, and optimistic person. My mom told me he was the most punctual person she ever knew, and during his career he went over 25 years without missing a day of work. He lived a long life, making others feel special. I like that.

(KT File) Believe it or not, this high priced Dh25,690 ticket is not for a business or first class flight, but an economy class flight with Emirates Airline from Dubai International Airport to Rio De Janeiro in Brazil. The reason for this extraordinary fare are the 2016 Olympic Games currently underway in Rio. The 17-day sports event was declared open on August 5, 2016, and will run until August 21, 2016 in Rio De Janeiro. By comparison, an Emirates business class ticket during the August period for a flight from Dubai to New York on a Superjumbo A380, has a starting price from Dh16,830. Passengers to Rio De Janeiro will pay this high price only during the Olympic Games period, following which the price for an economy class ticket with Emirates Airline will go back to below Dh10,000 a few days after the Olympic Games ending. Emirates operates a daily flight to the second largest city of Brazil, and has assigned a Boeing 777 for the route. Globally Emirates Airline connect 154 destinations out of Dubai. The Dubai-based airline is the world's largest Boeing 777 operator, flying 156 out of over 1,400 Boeing 777s delivered. The world's largest twinjet has a typical seating capacity of 314 to 451 passengers with a range of 5,235 to 9,500 nautical miles. In addition the airline is also the largest customer of Airbus A380 superjumbo. - abdulbasit@khaleejtimes.com   Share More > Vote MORE FROM Business Markets Saudis set to open market to foreigners Each foreign institutional investor will be allowed to own directly a ...

Showbiz Celebrity News Margot Robbie says Cara Delevingne ‘drunk texts’ Prince Harry Delevingne and Robbie are friends with the young royal Emma Powell Monday 8 August 2016 10:18 BST Best friends: Cara Delevingne and Margot Robbie Jonathan Leibson/Getty Margot Robbie has revealed her Suicide Squad co-star Cara Delevingne sends texts to Prince Harry when she is drunk. Robbie let slip about the messages as she opened up about her friendship with the model-turned-actress. “We just talk about regular girl stuff,” she told the Daily Star. “She is like, ‘I’ve had sex on a plane,’ and I’ll be like, ‘Yeah, but I’ve had it on a jet ski’. “And she will then blow me out of the water and tell me she ‘drunk texts’ Prince Harry. So I’m just like, ‘Okay, you win’.” Read more 8 reasons why we want to be best friends with Margot Robbie Robbie recently opened up about her own texting sessions with the young royal. The Australian actress said she receives messages from the fifth in line to the throne but often leaves him “hanging” for weeks. Robbie – who met the Prince through Delevingne – told E! News: "He's pretty quick on text actually. "Unlike me—I write back four days later, weeks later sometimes." Robbie also opened up about playing the psychotic Harley Quinn in Suicide Squad and said she was scared of being unable to fit into the hotpants and fishnet tights.

By: Reuters | Beirut | Published:August 8, 2016 12:59 pm (Source: Reuters/File)Iran has made clear it is widening its search to include other suppliers. Iran intends to purchase 20 regional jets from a unit of Japan’s Mitsubishi Heavy Industries , according to Asghar Fakhrieh Kashan, deputy minister for international affairs at the Ministry of Roads and Urban Development. The Mehr News agency quoted Fakhrieh Kashan on Sunday as saying that the deal was likely to be finalised when a Japanese delegation visits Tehran in December. The aircraft will be acquired through a lease-purchase contract and will be used by Aseman Airlines on domestic routes, Fakhrieh Khashan said. The lifting of long-standing economic sanctions against Iran in exchange for curbs on its nuclear activities has allowed it to strike provisional deals worth around $50 billion with Boeing and Airbus to buy some 200 airliners to renew its ageing fleet. However, financial and political obstacles have continued to dog the deals, and Iran has made clear it is widening its search to include other suppliers. The Mitsubishi Regional Jet, Japan’s first commercial airplane in half a century, will seat just under 100 people and is being developed by Mitsubishi Aircraft Corp, which is majority owned by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries.

The authority said it opened the investigation in July and asked anyone with relevant information to come forward. A spokesperson for the SFO said additional details of the probe would not be made public until charges were brought or the investigation is dropped. European planemaker Airbus said it was aware of the probe and the aviation firm was working with investigators. “Airbus Group has been informed by the SFO that it has opened a criminal investigation into allegations of fraud, bribery and corruption in the civil aviation business of Airbus Group relating to irregularities concerning third party consultants,” the company said in a statement. “Airbus Group continues to cooperate with the SFO,” the statement concluded. The company was informed on Friday that the authority had launched an investigation, an Airbus spokesman told AFP. “We ourselves detected this issue and self-disclosed it to the authorities. “This is as an effort of our enhanced anti-corruption (policy). Management has taken robust action and is determined to resolve this issue in cooperation with the authorities,” spokesman Jeremy Greaves said. Airbus informed authorities of the irregularities in April. The same month the UK Export Finance decided to suspend export credits to the firm, a move followed by France and Germany. The aviation firm said at the time it hoped to resolve the financing problem as soon as possible. The current SFO investigation is expected to take years. The probe was described by the Financial Times newspaper as a “severe blow to the European aircraft maker” which would be exploited by its US rival Boeing. Airbus is the largest commercial aerospace company in Britain and last month said its net profit rose 15 per cent in the first half of the year. Profits were up 1.76 billion euros (USD 1.94 billion), but the gain was due to exceptional items that masked a slide in operating earnings. The company was hit by charges of just over 1 billion euros related to its troubled A400M military cargo transporter programme, while adverse currency movements and charges on its widebody A350 aircraft totalled nearly 900 million. However, these were compensated for by the sale of shares in Dassault Aviation and the creation of a rocket launcher joint venture with Safran that generated a net gain of nearly 1.9 billion euros.UK—AIRBUS Britain launches fraud probe into Airbus London, Aug 8 (AFP) Britain’s Serious Fraud Office has said on it had opened a criminal probe into Airbus Group, investigating allegations of fraud, bribery and corruption. “These allegations relate to irregularities concerning third party consultants,” the SFO said in a statement yesterday.

The Straits Times Print Britain's Serious Fraud Office said on Sunday it had opened a criminal probe into Airbus Group, investigating allegations of fraud, bribery and corruption. "These allegations relate to irregularities concerning third party consultants," the SFO said in a statement. The authority said it opened the investigation in July and asked anyone with relevant information to come forward. A spokesperson for the SFO said additional details of the probe would not be made public until charges were brought or the investigation is dropped. European planemaker Airbus said it was aware of the probe and the aviation firm was working with investigators. "Airbus Group has been informed by the SFO that it has opened a criminal investigation into allegations of fraud, bribery and corruption in the civil aviation business of Airbus Group relating to irregularities concerning third party consultants," the company said in a statement. "Airbus Group continues to co-operate with the SFO," the statement concluded. The company was informed on Friday that the authority had launched an investigation, an Airbus spokesman told AFP. "We ourselves detected this issue and self-disclosed it to the authorities. "This is as an effort of our enhanced anti-corruption (policy). Management has taken robust action and is determined to resolve this issue in co-operation with the authorities," spokesman Jeremy Greaves said. Airbus informed authorities of the irregularities in April. The same month the UK Export Finance decided to suspend export credits to the firm, a move followed by France and Germany. The aviation firm said at the time it hoped to resolve the financing problem as soon as possible. The current SFO investigation is expected to take years. The probe was described by the Financial Times newspaper as a "severe blow to the European aircraft maker" which would be exploited by its US rival Boeing. Airbus is the largest commercial aerospace company in Britain and last month said its net profit rose 15 per cent in the first half of the year. Profits were up 1.76 billion euros ($1.94 billion), but the gain was due to exceptional items that masked a slide in operating earnings. The company was hit by charges of just over 1 billion euros related to its troubled A400M military cargo transporter programme, while adverse currency movements and charges on its widebody A350 aircraft totaled nearly 900 million. However these were compensated for by the sale of shares in Dassault Aviation and the creation of a rocket launcher joint venture with Safran that generated a net gain of nearly 1.9 billion euros. Ahead of British voters' decision in June to leave the EU, Airbus said it would reconsider future investment in the country if the referendum took the UK out of Europe. "Airbus Group's success in the UK is predicated on a highly competitive, integrated European business model," executives said in a letter sent to employees in April.

"We have held negotiations with Japan to purchase MRJ (Mitsubishi Regional Jet passenger) planes from Mitsubishi," Fakhriyeh Kashan said on Sunday. He explained that the MRJ planes are small aircraft with the capacity of carrying maximum 100 people which is a good choice for Iran's Aseman airlines whose flights are mostly domestic. Fakhriyeh Kashan also referred to negotiations with the French-Italian aircraft manufacturer ATR on buying small planes, and said Iran needs more than 20 small planes. Japan's Mitsubishi passenger plane manufacturing company is preparing to start rivalry with giant aviation firms like Boeing and Airbus in Iran's aviation and air transport market. The company, the aviation arm of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries - has been negotiating over jet sales with Iran’s flag carrier Iran Air and Iran Aseman Airlines, as Iran Air is weighing the Japanese offer to purchase of 80 70-seat Mitsubishi Regional Jets for domestic routes. Executives from both sides also discussed a possible deal in early June during the International Air Transport Association conference in Dublin. Late in July, Tehran and Tokyo signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) to further broaden mutual cooperation in the field of transportation. The MoU was signed in a ceremony in Tokyo by Fakhriyeh Kashan and his Japanese counterpart Hiroshi Tabata. The MoU was the outcome of the first Iran-Japan joint commission on infrastructure and transport. Tabata welcomed implementation of Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) and underlined the important role of infrastructures for Iran-Japan cooperation in future.         Related News Iran, Japan Ink MoU on Inspectorate Cooperation  Japan's Mitsubishi Emerging as New Rival for Boeing, Airbus in Iran's Aviation Industry  LATEST STORIES (80) ISIL War: In a Time of Universal Deceit, Telling the Truth Is a Revolutionary Act Iran, Azerbaijan Discuss Defense Ties Iran, Indonesia Stress Boosting Cooperation on Human Rights Iran Calls for Collective Efforts to Fight Terrorism UNHCR Official: Iran's Supports for Refugees "Unmatched" US Gives Green Light to Airbus on Sale of over 100 Passenger Planes to Iran Rouhani Felicitates Lebanon on Independence Day Iran, UNIDO Ink Country Program Framework Syrian Commander: Popular Uprising against Terrorists Starts in Eastern Aleppo Battle for Mosul Day 37: Hashd Al-Sha'abi Completes Siege of Tal Afar Israel 'Revives' Eastern Jerusalem Settler Homes Plan Hashd Al-Shaabi Wins Back Several More Villages Near Mosul Libyan Forces Press Forward Against ISIL in Sirte Iranian Speaker: Establishment of Democracy Impossible by Supporting Terrorism in Syria Envoy: Damascus against Proposals to Create Autonomous Areas in Syria ISIL War: In a Time of Universal Deceit, Telling the Truth Is a Revolutionary Act TEHRAN (FNA)- There is no moral difference between a US Stealth bomber and an ISIL suicide bomber.

By Rachel Middleton August 8, 2016 02:56 BST Airbus has come under scrutiny by the UK Serious Fraud Office.Reuters The UK's Serious Fraud Office (SFO) has launched a criminal investigation into Airbus Group, looking into allegations of fraud, bribery and corruption. The SFO said it had originally opened the investigation in July and has asked anyone with relevant information to come forward. "These allegations relate to irregularities concerning third party consultants," said the SFO said in a statement. However, a spokesperson said that additional details of the probe will not be made public until charges are brought or the investigation is dropped, AFP reports. Airbus said that it was aware of the investigations being launched and that it was working with investigators. "Airbus Group has been informed by the SFO that it has opened a criminal investigation into allegations of fraud, bribery and corruption in the civil aviation business of Airbus Group relating to irregularities concerning third party consultants," the company said in a statement. "Airbus continues to cooperate with the SFO, " the European plane manufacturer added. A company spokesman told AFP that the company was informed on Friday 5 August that the SFO had launched an investigation. "We ourselves detected this issue and self-disclosed it to the authorities." "This is as an effort of our enhanced anti-corruption [policy]. Management has taken robust action and is determined to resolve this issue in cooperation with the authorities," company spokesman Jeremy Greaves said. Airbus had revealed in April that that it was in discussions with the SFO after having admitted it had failed to notify the authorities on the use of third-party agents in deals which it was asking for UK government to cover with financing guarantees. On Sunday (7 August), The Financial Times said the UK's export credit agency and its counterparts in France and Germany had suspended financing following the disclosure by the company. At the end of July, the company said it had agreed to a deal with the UK export credit agency to resume financing by the end of the year. A spokesman for UK Export Finance said: "UKEF continues to work closely with Airbus and French and German export credit agencies to understand the extent of the matter and to seek assurances about its current compliance practices in relation to overseas agents." It added that it would closely follow other UK government agencies' investigations and "respond accordingly." The Financial Times also noted that the launch of a formal criminal investigation is a severe blow to Airbus, which it says could last several years. It is also likely to be exploited by the company's main rival, Boeing, the newspaper also claimed in its report. In addition, France and Germany and possibly other countries could also launch their own inquiries into Airbus's use of agents. Use of third-party agents The use of third-party intermediaries has been the target of anti-bribery regulators while several companies have cut back on the use of agents to clinch orders. The US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the UK's Bribery Act require high levels of risk-based due diligence when intermediaries are used to carry out business on behalf of a company, the FT said. Failure to do so will reportedly result in heavy penalties being imposed. The newspaper said that senior aerospace officials have however acknowledged that it is difficult in some countries to carry out business activities without these intermediaries.

The Toulouse, France-based planemaker said in a statement Sunday that it’s cooperating with investigators probing its civil aviation business.  Airbus had flagged to UK regulators and the European Export Credit Agencies earlier this year “misstatements and omissions” involving the outside contractors in some export financing applications, which it found through an internal probe. The credit agencies, including UK Export Finance, have suspended some of the backstop financing that Airbus uses to help sell commercial aircraft since the first revelations made four months ago. Airbus said in a July 27 statement that a process for re-establishing export credit “has been agreed and is ongoing.” Until the financing is restored, Airbus and rival Boeing Co. face the challenge of navigating an uncertain market with limited government assistance. Chicago-based Boeing has been unable to tap trade financing because a congressional impasse has left the US Export-Import bank with too few directors to approve deals. Jefferies Equity Research estimates that export-credit agencies last year provided 7 per cent of financing for Airbus plane deliveries, compared with 45 per cent from leasing companies and 40 per cent from airlines themselves. The Airbus investigation adds to the scrutiny of the role played by cross-border intermediaries. Monaco-based Unaoil SAM, which served as a go-between for companies and officials in the Middle East, Africa and former Soviet countries, was searched by authorities earlier this year amid allegations of corruption. Airbus said in the July 27 filing that it’s undertaking a sweeping review involving “legal, investigative, and forensic accounting” of consultants and other third parties used to support sales. The European planemaker said it’s also using greater due diligence to screen potential contractors. “The group cannot exclude that the comprehensive review and these enhancements of its controls and practices lead to additional commercial disputes or other consequences in the future,” the filing said. — Bloomberg                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Chinese-made US$100b city in Johor 'scares the hell out of everybody' Lufthansa pilots’ strike wreaks havoc on flight schedule Australia’s Crown Resorts casino staff arrested in China Merkel ‘not happy’ Trump scrapping Pacific trade deal Healthcare stocks drag Wall Street lower Chinese-made US$100b city in Johor 'scares the hell out of everybody' Foreign banks shaken by Malaysia's move to halt currency slide Malaysia’s central bank says will no longer tolerate ringgit trade in NDF market Ex-Valeant executive, ex-pharmacy CEO charged for fraud scheme Bank Negara Malaysia says it is intervening in currency market Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: China goes global as Trump puts America first Reuters Video: Facebook crafts censorship tool to re-enter China, says NYT Reuters Video: Antigua PM gives Prince Harry awkward honeymoon invite MMOTV: Mahathir, Siti Hasmah head to KLCC by car MMOTV: Red Shirts heckle yellow-shirted Bersih participants MMOTV: A Red Shirts supporter hurls abuse at Bersih supporters Related Articles Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2016 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | RecomN - Local Services

The company was hit by charges of just over €1 billion related to its troubled A400M military cargo transporter program, while adverse currency movements and charges on its widebody A350 aircraft totaled nearly €900 million. However, these were compensated for by the sale of shares in Dassault Aviation and the creation of a rocket launcher joint venture with Safran that generated a net gain of nearly €1.9 billion. Ahead of British voters’ decision in June to leave the EU, Airbus said it would reconsider future investment in the country if the referendum took the U.K. out of Europe. “Airbus Group’s success in the U.K. is predicated on a highly competitive, integrated European business model,” executives said in a letter sent to employees in April.

NAIROBI: When Kenya Airways published the country's worst-ever corporate results last month, the scale of the loss revealed the effects of several disastrous decisions that the national carrier is struggling to reverse. The airline's "Pride of Africa" slogan rang uncomfortably hollow when the $259-million loss was announced, driven by higher borrowing costs and unfavourable exchange rates. Kenya Airways, founded in 1977 following the demise of East African Airways, was considered a cash cow just a decade ago, but is now floundering, said independent analyst Aly-Khan Satchu. "In the history of Kenya, no other listed company has ever recorded such an important loss, " Satchu said. A misguided expansion strategy launched in 2011 is the root of the catastrophic state of the firm, a move that called for the purchase of new Boeing planes with the objective of doubling the size of its network. But since then the Ebola virus and terror attacks on the continent have decimated Africa's tourist numbers, while rivals such as state-owned Ethiopian Airlines and Qatar Airways have boosted their offerings. The firm has also lost out on rock-bottom fuel prices. Like many airlines, it "hedges" its fuel costs by entering into a fixed-price contracts. But Kenya Airways was locked into longer term contracts than most of its competitors, which gained a competitive advantage as fuel prices have plunged since mid-2014. Foreign currency "and fuel hedging are exceptional items, yes, but a company like KQ (Kenya Airways) should be able to deal with this," said Satchu about the airline's latest results. To the dismay of Kenya Airways' two biggest backers -- Air France-KLM and the Kenyan government - the firm's share price has dropped from 140 shillings in 2006 to 3.85 shillings. The company's debts exceed a billion dollars.

(Photo by Michael Marsland for Yale) St. Louis attorney Jerry Schlichter, who has won more than $150 million from several large companies accused of overcharging employees for their retirement plans, is targeting three universities in his latest lawsuits. Schlichter's firm, Schlichter Bogard & Denton, filed lawsuits Tuesday on behalf of employees at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, New York University and Yale University. All three complaints allege that employees were forced to pay millions of dollars in unreasonable and excessive fees. MIT offers a 401(k) defined-contribution plan for its employees, while NYU and Yale have similar 403(b) plans, which are for non-profit employers.  The lawsuit against MIT alleges that the university chose Fidelity Investments as its plan recordkeeper without a competitive bidding process. It also says that MIT placed more than 150 Fidelity funds in its 401(k), including high-priced retail funds for which cheaper alternatives were available. "The universities do not have high priced retail mutual funds in their multibillion-dollar endowments, yet they have them in their employees’ retirement plans, resulting in the employees paying excessive fees and diminishing their retirement savings,” Schlichter said in a statement. The suit also points out that Fidelity CEO Abigail Johnson is an MIT trustee and that Fidelity has donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to the university.

Check our People in Business The suits against NYU and Yale allege that the 403(b) plans paid excessive recordkeeping fees because they split their assets between multiple firms. They also say the universities imprudently kept funds in the plans even after they had underperformed for years. Schlichter's firm has filed 20 excessive-fee suits since 2006 and reached settlements in nine of them. Last December, it won a $57 million settlement in a suit over Boeing's 401(k) plan. Previous settlements include $62 million from Lockheed Martin, $30 million from International Paper, $27.5 million from Ameriprise and $16.5 million from Caterpillar. In May 2015, Schlichter won a U.S. Supreme Court case involving Edison International's 401(k) plan.

 Chief Air Force scientist: Tomorrow's drones will be faster, stealthier, and more deadly Kris Osborn, Scout Warrior Aug. 8, 2016, 1:56 PM 1,543 facebook linkedin twitter email print Northrop Grumman/EADS Euro Hawk rollout on October 8, 2009 at Palmdale, CA, USA. Northrop Grumman The drones of tomorrow will be stealthier, faster, more computerized, equipped for electronic warfare, more lethal, more autonomous and, in some cases, able to deploy as swarming groups of mini-drones, according to the Air Force’s Chief Scientist. “The ISR (intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance) side will get a lot smarter. With the next generation, you will see UAVs that are faster, more maneuverable and maybe stealthy. You will see them accompanying fighters with extra weapons, EW (electronic warfare), countermeasures and even lasers on board,” Air Force Chief Scientist Greg Zacharias told Scout Warrior in an interview. Some of these anticipated developments were forecasted in a 2014 Air Force report called RPA (Remotely Piloted Aircraft) Vector designed to anticipate and prepare for future drone developments over the coming 25 years. However, the rapid pace of technological change has sped up and, to some extent, changed the timeline and mission scope for drones outlined in the report.  Artificial Intelligence and Autonomy The processing speeds of computers and algorithms aimed at increasing autonomous activities have continued to evolve at an alarming rate, creating a fast-moving circumstance wherein drones will increasingly take on more and more functions by themselves, Zacharias explained. Computer algorithms will enable drones to conduct a much wider range of functions without needing human intervention, such as sensing, targeting, weapons adjustments and sensor payload movements, ranges and capabilities, he added. Developments with “artificial intelligence,” (AI) will better enable unmanned platforms to organize, interpret and integrate functions independently such as ISR filtering, sensor manipulation, maneuvering, navigation and targeting adjustments.  In essence, emerging computer technology will better enable drones to make more decisions and perform more functions by themselves. The beginning of this phenomenon is evidenced in the computers and sensor technologies of the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter; the aircraft uses a technique known as “sensor fusion” wherein information from multiple sensors is organized, interpreted and presented to pilots on a single screen.  An MQ-1 Predator and an MQ-9 Reaper assigned to the 432nd Aircraft Maintenance Squadron remain ready for their next mission at Creech Air Force Base, Nev. The two aircraft have provided intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance during Operations Iraqi Freedom and Enduring Freedom. USAF/Staff Sgt. Vernon Young Jr. Digital mapping, ISR information from the F-35’s Distributed Aperture System and targeting data from its Electro-Optical Targeting System are not dispersed across multiple screens which pilots try to view simultaneously. Fast evolving sensor technology, which allows for an ability to more closely view targets and tactically relevant information from increasingly farther distances, will continue to enable and improve this trending phenomenon. One of the largest consequences of AI will likely lead to a scenario wherein multiple humans will no longer need to control a single drone – rather multiple drones will be controlled by a single human performing command and control functions. “People will function as air-traffic controllers rather than pilots, using smart, independent platforms. A person does command and control and drones execute functions. The resource allocation will be done by humans as higher level systems managers,” Zacharias explained. As a result, drones will increasingly be capable of working more closely with nearby manned aircraft, almost functioning like a co-pilot in the cockpit and massively expanding the mission scope of a fighter jet or other aircraft able to control targeting, sensors and weapons functions from the air nearby. “Decision aides will be in the cockpit (of a nearby fighter jet or aircraft) and platform oriented autonomous systems will function like a wing man, for instance, that might be carrying extra weapons, helping to defend or performing ISR tasks,” Zacharias said. “We will get beyond simple guidance and control and will get into tactics and execution.” Drones could lead the way into higher-risk areas in order to reduce risks for manned aircraft, test and challenged next-generation enemy air defenses and greatly increase the ISR and weapons ability of any given mission. An X-47B pilot-less drone combat aircraft is prepared for launch from the deck of the USS George H. W. Bush aircraft carrier in the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Norfolk, Virginia, July 10, 2013. REUTERS/Rich-Joseph Facun In addition, drones will become more capable of air-to-air maneuvers and attacks and no longer be primarily engineered for air-to-ground attacks. In fact, early conceptual renderings of 6th generation fighter jets and the Air Force’s in-development Long Range Strike-Bomber are being engineered for unmanned flight as well as piloted flight. Nevertheless, although drones and unmanned fighters will rapidly become faster and more maneuverable, algorithms may not soon progress to the point where unmanned systems can respond or react to unanticipated developments in a dynamic, fast-changing environment the way a human brain could. At the same time, advances in long-range sensor technology will continue to enable aircraft to see enemies at much longer distances, massively decreasing the need for drones or unmanned systems to be able to dogfight in mid-air.  During the last decade and a half of ground wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, where U.S. forces experienced uncontested air superiority, drones were used almost exclusively for air-to-ground attacks against insurgent fighters on the run, compounds, weapons caches, bunkers and other strategically vital targets. As the Air Force looks to the future, it aims to be capable of using drones as a key part of successfully engaging near-peer competitors and potential adversaries with technological ability able to rival the U.S. edge. Russia and China, for example, both operate 5th generation stealth fighters (the latest and greatest technology) – and Russia is known to operate some of the most sophisticated enemy air defenses in the world.  Russian-built air defenses, such as the S-300 and S-400, are now better networked to one another, have faster processing speeds and are able to detect fighter aircraft on a wider range of frequencies, making it much more difficult for even stealthy fighters and bombers to operate. Russia is even reported to be developing a more-advanced S-500 able to hit ranges greater than 125 miles.  These potential scenarios, now being studied by Pentagon analysts, involve developing an ability to operate in what is called a “contested environment,” where enemies operate advanced air defenses, 5th generation fighter jets and long-range precision-guided weapons. “You need to increasingly be able to react more to your environment in the air, addressing unanticipated failures and threats coming after you,” Zacharias added.   Zacharias explained that many of these developments will come to fruition more fully through ongoing training, simulations and live virtual constructions designed to assess various expected scenarios. DARPA Faster computer processing power will also better enable an ability to organize and streamline the massive amount of collected ISR data. If a drone loiters over strategically important areas for hours upon hours, computer algorithms will increasingly allow the platform to identify important tactical information by itself. “Right now we are using lots of bandwidth to send our real-time video. One of the things that we have is smarter on-board processors. An RPA (drone) can orbit around a given target and have it look, for instance, for a relevant white pick-up truck, instead of having human operators do that,” he said. “This requires image processing, pattern recognition. Then you could just send a signal instead of using up all this bandwidth saying ‘hey I just saw something 30 seconds ago you might want to take a look at the video feed which I am sending right now.’” The ability for a single human to control multiple drones could bring a number of implications, such as an ability to effectively use a swarm of small drones. Air Force scientists have explained that emerging algorithms are increasingly able to allow large numbers of small, mini-drones to operate in unison without hitting one another. For instance, they could collectively work to jam or overwhelm an enemy radar system, act themselves as weapons or munitions, or cover an expansive area with ISR video feeds. More Lethal Drones A wider arsenal of weapons will also be integrated onto drone platforms, including high-tech guided weapons able to discern and destroy enemy targets by themselves to a much greater degree. This will likely include laser weapons as well, Zacharias added. These weapons will naturally include laser-guided AGM-114 Hellfire missiles which are the primary weapon used by today’s platforms such as the Predator, Reaper and Army Gray Eagle.  At the same time, drones or unmanned platforms are expected to fire a wider range of guided air-dropped munitions and air-to-air weapons such as the AIM-9 Sidewinder, AIM-120 AMRAAM. Also, the Air Force is now developing an air-dropped guided weapon called the Small Diameter Bomb II. This weapon uses an emerging technology called a tri-mode seeker, which draws upon infrared, laser and millimeter wave radar technology to detect, track and destroy targets in any kind of weather environment. AP Photo/Matt York At the same time, Pentagon doctrine stipulates that a human needs to be in-the-loop when it comes to the possible use of lethal force, except potentially in some rare circumstance where immediate defensive weapons are needing in milliseconds due to an incoming attack, Zacharias explained.  As a result, nearly all weapons will help distinguish, track and destroy targets under the guidance and supervision of human command and control. Given the pace of technological change, future Air Force drones will also need to be modular, meaning they will be engineered such that they can readily exchange sensor payloads when mission requirements change or new technology emerges, Air Force officials said. Future drones will also be much faster than the 200 to 300 miles per hour most current drones are able to travel at. Hypersonic speeds greater than Mach 5.5 may be in the very distant future; the Air Force Research Laboratory and Boeing have worked together on an emerging hypersonic test platform called the X-51A Waverider. The test vehicle has had both failed and successful test trying to launch from an aircraft and travel at hypersonic speeds. While this super-high speed technology may hold promise for possible drone applications in the distant future, it is currently regarded as a long way off and in need of much further development.  Nevertheless, there have been some successfull flights of hypersonic technology, including on in May of 2013 wherein the X-51A Waverider flew over the Pacific Ocean reaching speeds of Mach 5.1. This May 1 test flight wound up being the longest air-breathing hypersonic flight ever, wrapping up a $300 million technology demonstration program beginning in 2004, according to an Air Force statement. U.S. airmen prepare a U.S. Air Force MQ-9 Reaper drone as it leaves on a mission at Kandahar Air Field Thomson Reuters “The X-51A took off from the Air Force Test Center at Edwards AFB, Calif., under the wing of B-52H Stratofortress. It was released at approximately 50,000 feet and accelerated to Mach 4.8 in about 26 seconds powered by a solid rocket booster. After separating from the booster, the cruiser’s supersonic combustion ramjet, or scramjet, engine then lit and accelerated the aircraft to Mach 5.1 at 60,000 feet,” a previous Air Force Statement explaining the test stated.  Naturally, massively increased speed could give drones an ability to urgently reach and potentially deliver weapons and sensors to crucial time-sensitive combat situations exponentially faster. Stealthy Drones Future drones will also be quite stealthy, as a technique for having more success against high-tech air defenses. There are already a number of stealthy drones in various stages of development. One such example is Lockheed Martin's RQ-170 Sentinel stealth UAV which, according to a 2011 report in The Atlantic, helped track Bin Laden’s compound prior to his death. Boeing has unveiled its Phantom Ray, a fighter-sized unmanned combat air vehicle which first flew in 2011. The aircraft has a 50-foot wingspan, can climb to 40,000 feet and reach speeds of Mach .85.  Read more: Top IoT Companies to Watch & Invest In Best IoT Conferences & Expos IoT Wearable Devices & Technology How the IoT Will Affect Security & Privacy Ultimate IoT Research Bundle Read the original article on Scout Warrior.

The New York Times, in collaboration with the New England Center for Investigative Reporting, has a deep dive on the corporate financing of think-tank research, including examples involving defense contractors, drones and aircraft carriers: “Think tanks, which position themselves as ‘universities without students,’ have power in government policy debates because they are seen as researchers independent of moneyed interests. But in the chase for funds, think tanks are pushing agendas important to corporate donors, at times blurring the line between researchers and lobbyists. And they are doing so while reaping the benefits of their tax-exempt status, sometimes without disclosing their connections to corporate interests.” Story Continued Below “On issues as varied as military sales to foreign countries, international trade, highway management systems and real estate development, think tanks have frequently become vehicles for corporate influence and branding campaigns. … The likely conclusions of some think tank reports, documents show, are discussed with donors — or even potential ones — before the research is complete. Drafts of the studies have been shared with donors whose opinions have then helped shape final reports. Donors have outlined how the resulting scholarship will be used as part of broader lobbying efforts.” NEW THIS MORNING — JAPAN’S ELDERLY EMPEROR SIGNALS A DESIRE TO STEP DOWN, via The Washington Post: “Japan’s popular emperor sent an unprecedented signal Monday of his desire to abdicate and hand over power to his son, sending the country into constitutionally uncharted waters. In a video address to the nation — only the second time an emperor has spoken to the people in this way — 82-year-old Akihito described how his declining health was curtailing his abilities to fulfill his duties. “‘When I consider that my fitness level is gradually declining, I am worried that it may become difficult for me to carry out my duties as the symbol of the state with my whole being as I have done until now,’ Akihito said in the address Monday. … Under the U.S.-drafted constitution imposed on Japan after World War II, the emperor was stripped of all his powers, becoming a figurehead only. He is legally constrained from saying anything political, meaning that Akihito could not declare his intention to step down because that would require the parliament to amend the Imperial Household Law.” IRAN EXECUTES NUCLEAR SCIENTIST OVER ALLEGED U.S. SPYING, our colleague Nahal Toosi has more here: “The Iranian government has executed a nuclear scientist who was believed to have cooperated with U.S. intelligence but who returned to Iran after claiming he had been abducted and tortured by the CIA. The tale of Shahram Amiri was one of the stranger sagas to emerge from Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton's tenure as secretary of state, testing her diplomatic skills in highly sensitive circumstances. “His death comes just over a year after Iran and the U.S. struck a deal aimed at reining in Iran's nuclear program, an agreement Clinton was instrumental in launching. State-controlled Iranian media on Sunday confirmed Amiri's execution, quoting an Iranian judiciary spokesman as saying that Amiri ‘provided the enemy with vital information of the country.’” — U.S. PAYMENT TO IRAN A PARTISAN WEDGE: President Barack Obama’s dismissal last week of the outrage over a cash payment sent to Iran didn’t stop the debate over the plane-delivered cash, with Republicans charging on Sunday it is encouraging future kidnappings. Meanwhile, Hillary Clinton’s vice presidential running mate, Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.), defended the payment as a “legitimate claim against the United States.” HAPPY MONDAY AND WELCOME TO MORNING DEFENSE, where we’re always amazed at how many random sports we find ourselves watching during the Olympics. Field hockey, rugby, archery — we almost prefer those to gymnastics and swimming. Keep the tips, pitches and handball schedules coming at jherb@politico.com, and follow on Twitter @jeremyherb, @morningdefense and @politicopro. MORNING D TRIVIA: Eric Magnell was the first to correctly answer that Gen. George S. Patton competed in the first modern Pentathlon at the 1912 Summer Olympics. Wired has a breakdown from 2012 of Patton’s Olympic performance, where he didn't win a medal. Check back Friday for our next trivia question. WAR REPORT — ISIL CLAIMS CAPTURE OF U.S. WEAPONS IN AFGHANISTAN, via Reuters: “Militants linked to Islamic State have released photos that purport to show weapons and equipment that belonged to American soldiers and were captured by the group in eastern Afghanistan. The photos, which came to light on Saturday, show an American portable rocket launcher, radio, grenades and other gear not commonly used by Afghan troops, as well as close up views of identification cards for a U.S. Army soldier, Specialist Ryan Larson. “The U.S. military command in Kabul denied any suggestion the soldier had been captured, saying he ‘has been accounted for and remains in a duty status within his unit.’ American special operations troops have been fighting alongside Afghan forces in a renewed offensive against militants who claim allegiance to Islamic State in Nangarhar Province, which borders Pakistan.” — ARMY ANNOUNCES NEW TROOP DEPLOYMENT TO IRAQ: The Army on Friday announced the deployment of 400 soldiers to Iraq as part of the 560 troops that Defense Secretary Ash Carter announced last month would help with the coming Iraqi-led operation to retake the Islamic State stronghold of Mosul. The 400 soldiers are from the 2nd Brigade Combat Team, 101st Airborne Division, stationed at Fort Campbell, Ky. The soldiers, the Army said in a statement, will join about 1,300 members of the same unit who deployed to Iraq in the spring. — INTENSE FIGHTING IN ALEPPO AFTER REBELS BREAK SIEGE, The Wall Street Journal reports: “Fighting raged in Aleppo on Sunday between rebels and Syrian regime forces, a day after the opposition broke a weeks-long government siege on its eastern half. The rebel factions are making a bid to open a main road for food and humanitarian aid to reach some 300,000 civilians who have been besieged in opposition-held areas of Syria’s former commercial capital.” THE BIG PICTURE — RUSSIA IS WINNING PROXY WAR WITH U.S., writes The New York Times: “For the first time since Afghanistan in the 1980s, the Russian military for the past year has been in direct combat with rebel forces trained and supplied by the C.I.A. The American-supplied Afghan fighters prevailed during that Cold War conflict. But this time the outcome — thus far — has been different. … Russia’s battlefield successes in Syria have given Moscow, isolated by the West after its annexation of Crimea and other incursions into Ukraine, new leverage in decisions about the future of the Middle East.” U.S. RELEASES ITS ‘DRONE PLAYBOOK,’ in response to a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit from the American Civil Liberties Union, reports our colleague Josh Gerstein: “President Barack Obama has to personally approve the killing of a U.S. citizen targeted for a lethal drone strike outside combat areas, according to a policy Obama adopted in 2013.The president also is called upon to approve drone strikes against permanent residents of the U.S. and when ‘there is a lack of consensus’ among agency chiefs about whom to target, but in other cases he is simply ‘apprised’ of the targeting decision, the newly disclosed document shows.” — FEDS, FILMMAKER FEUD OVER BERGDAHL, also via POLITICO’s Gerstein: “The Justice Department is urging a federal judge to shut down a bid by filmmaker Mark Boal to block military prosecutors from subpoenaing unaired outtakes of 25 hours of interviews Boal conducted with alleged Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, who is facing a court-martial on charges he deserted a U.S. base in Afghanistan. Boal's talks with Bergdahl became the staple of the second season of the celebrated podcast ‘Serial,’ but the bulk of the recorded conversations were never made public.” 2016 WATCH — VIRGINIA APPROPRIATOR RIGELL IS THE FIRST GOP CONGRESSMAN TO BACK GARY JOHNSON: Rep. Scott Rigell of Virginia is the first Republican congressman to endorse Libertarian Gary Johnson for president over Donald Trump, POLITICO’s Rebecca Morin reports. Rigell, who is retiring from Congress at the end of his term, said in an interview with The New York Times he was backing Johnson over both Trump and Hillary Clinton. INDUSTRY INTEL — BRITAIN OPENS FORMAL PROBE INTO AIRBUS, via the WSJ: “Britain’s top corruption investigator has opened a formal probe into plane maker Airbus Group SE’s use of consultants, escalating an investigation that has been simmering for months. Airbus said the U.K.’s Serious Fraud Office had opened a criminal probe into the company related to irregularities concerning third-party consultants that the British government identified back in April. The company said Sunday the probe is centered on allegations of fraud, bribery and corruption in the civil-aviation business of the plane maker, the world’s No. 2 behind Boeing Co. Those allegations are related to irregularities involving third-party consultants, the SFO and Airbus said.” SPEED READ — A bombing at a hospital in Pakistan kills at least 40 people: The Associated Press — Despite airstrikes, the Islamic State is holding on in the Libyan city of Sirte: The Washington Post — Would Hillary Clinton keep John Kerry on?: POLITICO — The new Wounded Warrior Project CEO expects an undisclosed number of layoffs: The Washington Post — China says it flew bombers and other military aircraft over the disputed areas of the South China Sea: WSJ — Thailand voters approve a military-backed constitution through at least December 2017: Reuters — Israeli and American officials are publicly arguing about the Iran nuclear agreement: Defense News — Five years after Congress approved the Budget Control Act, the predictions of disaster for the military have not materialized, but the spending caps still pose a threat: Military Times — The Navy is retiring its “blueberries” camouflage uniforms: Navy Times — U.S. fighters take Pokémon Go to the frontlines in Iraq: Stars and Stripes — Why retired Gen.
