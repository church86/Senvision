Idaho Business Health Nation/World Elections Photos Business Boeing books $3.8 billion order for 737 MAX jets from GE leasing unit WEDNESDAY, JAN. 4, 2017, 3:01 P.M. In this Monday, Dec. 7, 2015, photo, taken with a fisheye lens, the distinctive winglet on the second Boeing 737 MAX airplane being built is shown on the assembly line in Renton, Wash. (Ted S. Warren / AP) By Dominic Gates The Seattle Times Twitter Facebook  Email  Reddit  SMS SEATTLE – Boeing booked a big 737 MAX order worth an estimated $3.8 billion from the aircraft leasing arm of GE during the holiday break. GE Capital Aviation Services ordered 75 MAX 8 aircraft. GECAS’s support for the MAX is unsurprising because GE is the exclusive engine supplier for the airplane with its new LEAP engine The sale should boost Boeing’s 2016 net order tally above 600 airplanes. Boeing has projected about 740 deliveries for the year. With the typical year-end rush of sales, the final order tally may be close to that delivery figure. Also over the break, Czech airline Travel Service said it signed a deal to buy five more 737 MAXs, adding to a previous order for 25 of the jets. Boeing will announce its final 2016 sales and delivery figures Friday. At list prices, the GECAS deal is valued at $8.25 billion, but such orders typically get large discounts. According to market pricing data from aircraft valuation firm Avitas, the discount is at least 54 percent.

The President-elect reacted with a tweet reminding his comrades on Capitol Hill that Congress had better things to do. Within a day, House Republicans heeded the war By: Harlan Ullman 05-Jan-17 1547 1547 Top News Admiral Zakaullah calls on Bahrain’s naval chief 16-Jan-17 247 ISLAMABAD: Chief of Naval Staf ... Load shedding continues unabated despite PM’s claims 16-Jan-17 230 ISLAMABAD: The announcement ma ... Given President-elect (PE) Donald Trump’s ukase-like tweets last week, if President George W. Bush has not phoned his successor once removed with a crisp message, he should do so immediately. Six words are enough. “Donald, you are not president yet!” And, the 43rd president might have added, “And please do a little more homework before sounding off.” The President-elect’s preference to govern and rule by twitter is novel if not extraordinary. Both American and international audiences are puzzled, intrigued and in some cases concerned or worried by this approach to lead a country especially before taking office. And given Mr. Trump’s dependence on twitter, the betting is that as president, one is likely to see more not less. Some of his tweets over the past week or two clearly sparked reactions, good and bad. The intervention of Mr. Trump via twitter and MSNBC anchor Mika Brzezinski into the most vital and potentially existential national security issues is, at best, unhelpful. These tweets followed the post-election congratulatory phone calls Mr. Trump accepted from the Taiwan president and Pakistani prime minister. The first called into question the forty-five year old “one China policy.” The second provoked India. More seriously, Mr. Trump has called for “greatly strengthening and expanding” our nuclear weapons and boasted about winning a nuclear arms race against Russia; rejected the Obama administration’s abstention of a UN Security Council resolution condemning Israel for expanding settlements into the occupied territories; and threatened two major defense contractors — Boeing over the cost of the next Air Force One and Lockheed-Martin over the huge cost growth of the F-35 Lightning II fifth generation fighter. Since Dwight Eisenhower promised to go to Korea to end that war in 1952, no other President-elect has imposed himself so dramatically on the political scene as has Mr. Trump. The President-elect has done this with 140 characters rather than press conferences or written op-ed pieces. Serious people worry whether these interventions help or hurt American security especially when each appears to be an instinctive rather than a well-thought out response. And many fear this style of instant reaction is indicative of what will be a very active presidential bull in a very fragile China shop. Concerning the need for fuller understanding and knowledge of the issues, consider the tweets about nuclear weapons and the costs of Air Force One and the F-35 Lightning. During the campaign, Mr. Trump did not seem to understand what the nuclear triad of land, sea and air deterrent forces was or meant. Nor did the PE acknowledge that both Russia and America have signed the New Start Treaty limiting both sides to 1550 strategic launchers and about 5,000 warheads. If Mr. Trump was reacting to President Vladimir Putin’s meeting with his senior military leaders in which Putin vowed to make Russian strategic nuclear capabilities sufficient to defeat the West’s defensive anti-ballistic systems, did he appreciate the argument the Russian president was making? The answer appears to be no. Regarding Boeing and Air Force One, while the company’s CEO Dennis Muilenberg pledged to keep the cost below $4 billion that is not his or Boeing’s call. It is the White House that sets Air Force One’s requirements to protect the president from all dangers whether kinetic or electronic that drive costs. In prompting Boeing for an F-18 Super Hornet alternative to the F-35, did anyone advise the president that such a request had been made before and proved to be unworkable? Or did the PE know that only the Navy and Marines fly the F-18 not the Air Force? And did anyone inform the chief executive to be that eight other nations are planning to buy or have bought F-35’s so that cuts to the program could be disastrous for this coalition? But suppose Mr. Trump had taken a different tack based on a fuller understanding of these issues. He could have reminded President Putin that Ronald Reagan helped bankrupt the Soviet Union with the Strategic Defense Initiative. That tweet might have said: “Vlad, Star Wars broke you last time. Don’t force us to do it again!” About Air Force One, a tweet might have read: “$4 billion for AF One is outrageous. We will ensure the price is right.” And instead of trying to leverage Lockheed Martin’s F-35 costs with an upgraded Super Hornet, the next commander-in-chief could have proposed: “Unmanned aerial vehicles are smart, effective and can create jobs. Boeing and Lockheed, what can you do about that?” Earlier this week, the President-elect released two tweets that issued salutary warning that appears to have been effective. The city of Chicago released the tragic statistic of 762 people shot and killed in 2016. Mr. Trump tweeted that Chicago might ask for help from the federal government, an offer that was immediately accepted by Mayor Rahm Emmanuel — a Democrat and former Barack Obama chief of staff. The Republican House of Representatives decided to neuter the office of ethics oversight. The President-elect reacted with a tweet reminding his comrades on Capitol Hill that Congress had better things to do. Within a day, House Republicans heeded the warning and backed off the changes. Whatever one thinks of the president-elect, the greater challenge is not to make America great again. The challenge is to confront and fix the myriad problems, many irrational and self-imposed by a government in gridlock, that got Mr. Trump elected in the first place. Instinct is important provided it is headed in the proper direction. Instinct based on fuller knowledge and understanding is even better. Whether Mr. Trump’s last two tweets reflect a sea change in his attitudes or not remains to be seen. However this use of the Bully Pulpit, if it continues, could augur a refreshing change.   Harlan Ullman is UPI’s Arnaud de Borchgrave Distinguished Columnist and a Senior Advisor at Washington D.C.’s Atlantic Council and Business Executives for National Security.

REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon/Files By Alwyn Scott | SEATTLE SEATTLE Boeing Co (BA.N) said on Wednesday it had booked firm orders for 80 of its 737 MAX 8 aircraft, valued at $8.8 billion at list prices, upping its 2016 tally but leaving it short of its goal. The orders mean the world's biggest plane maker clinched at least 536 net jetliner sales last year compared with its target of selling as many commercial jets as it delivers, a total it puts between 745 and 750. Through November, Boeing had delivered 681 planes. Boeing's order tally could climb again on Friday, as the company posts its final update for 2016. Investors watch orders closely as a way to gauge future production and revenue, since Boeing earns the bulk of its money when aircraft are delivered. The company has orders equivalent to about seven years of production, but the majority are single-aisle 737 planes, and sales of its more expensive widebodies like the 777 remain sluggish. Boeing Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg affirmed the company's overall order target in July. In December, he said Boeing would cut 777 output by 40 percent this year due to slow sales of widebody planes. The orders announced Wednesday include 75 Boeing 737 MAX 8s for General Electric Co (GE.N) Capital Aviation Services (GECAS), valued at $8.25 billion at list prices. GE supplies engines for the 737 MAX through CFM International, a joint venture with Safran SA (SAF.PA) of France. The latest sale means GECAS now has 170 Boeing 737 MAXs on order, more than any other leasing company, Boeing said. The remaining orders, valued at $550 million, came from Travel Service, the largest airline company in the Czech Republic, which operates as SmartWings, Boeing said. Through December 20, Boeing booked 470 net orders in 2016. Since then, it has announced orders for four 737-800s by Jet2.com. On Dec. 27, Delta Air Lines (DAL.N) said it was cancelling an order for 18 Boeing 787 Dreamliners. Northwest Airlines placed the order before it merged with Delta. Tallying the changes, Boeing's book-to-bill ratio is 0.79, below the target of 1.0. A Boeing spokesman declined to comment, citing a quiet period before fourth-quarter earnings on Jan. 25. Boeing has received over 3,400 orders for the 737 MAX. The first 737 MAX is expected to be delivered in the first half of 2017. Boeing's shares were up about 1 percent at $158.46. Up to Tuesday's close, the stock had risen 11.7 percent in the past 12 months, compared with a 12.2 percent rise in the S&P 500 index .SPX.

REUTERS/Jim Young By Alwyn Scott | SEATTLE SEATTLE Boeing Co (BA.N) said on Wednesday it had booked firm orders for 80 of its 737 MAX 8 aircraft, valued at $8.8 billion at list prices, upping its 2016 tally but leaving it short of its goal. The orders mean the world's biggest plane maker clinched at least 536 net jetliner sales last year compared with its target of selling as many commercial jets as it delivers, a total it puts between 745 and 750. Through November, Boeing had delivered 681 planes. Boeing's order tally could climb again on Friday, as the company posts its final update for 2016. Investors watch orders closely as a way to gauge future production and revenue, since Boeing earns the bulk of its money when aircraft are delivered. The company has orders equivalent to about seven years of production, but the majority are single-aisle 737 planes, and sales of its more expensive widebodies like the 777 remain sluggish. Boeing Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg affirmed the company's overall order target in July. In December, he said Boeing would cut 777 output by 40 percent this year due to slow sales of widebody planes. The orders announced Wednesday include 75 Boeing 737 MAX 8s for General Electric Co (GE.N) Capital Aviation Services (GECAS), valued at $8.25 billion at list prices. GE supplies engines for the 737 MAX through CFM International, a joint venture with Safran SA (SAF.PA) of France. The latest sale means GECAS now has 170 Boeing 737 MAXs on order, more than any other leasing company, Boeing said. The remaining orders, valued at $550 million, came from Travel Service, the largest airline company in the Czech Republic, which operates as SmartWings, Boeing said. Through December 20, Boeing booked 470 net orders in 2016. Since then, it has announced orders for four 737-800s by Jet2.com. On Dec. 27, Delta Air Lines (DAL.N) said it was cancelling an order for 18 Boeing 787 Dreamliners. Northwest Airlines placed the order before it merged with Delta. Tallying the changes, Boeing's book-to-bill ratio is 0.79, below the target of 1.0. A Boeing spokesman declined to comment, citing a quiet period before fourth-quarter earnings on Jan. 25. Boeing has received over 3,400 orders for the 737 MAX. The first 737 MAX is expected to be delivered in the first half of 2017. Boeing's shares were up about 1 percent at $158.46. Up to Tuesday's close, the stock had risen 11.7 percent in the past 12 months, compared with a 12.2 percent rise in the S&P 500 index .SPX.

Additionally, Czech airline Travel Service said Wednesday it has signed a deal to buy five more new Boeing 737 MAX jets, bringing its orders to a total of 30 Boeing planes. The jets will be delivered between 2018 and 2023. Financial details were not disclosed. The airline, which operates regular flights under the name SmartWings as well as charter flights, is the biggest in the Czech Republic.

TrendsViral NASA announced on Tuesday that Elon Musk’s Space X and Boeing, headed by Dennis Muilenburg, have been awarded the new missions under the agency’s Commercial Crew Program. It brings each of their total NASA contracts to six. While the new contracts “do not include payments at this time”, the additional flights will allow SpaceX and Boeing to plan for future missions “while fulfilling space station transportation needs,” according to NASA. READ MORE: 2016 in space: A year of spectacular highs and crushing lows (PHOTOS, VIDEOS) "Awarding these missions now will provide greater stability for the future space station crew rotation schedule, as well as reduce schedule and financial uncertainty for our providers," said Phil McAlister, director at NASA’s Commercial Spaceflight Development Division. “The ability to turn on missions as needed to meet the needs of the space station program is an important aspect of the Commercial Crew Program,” he added.

SpaceX learns from Falcon 9 explosion, next launch days away On top of that, SpaceX and Boeing will transport about 220lb (100kg) of cargo to the ISS, and provide a “lifeboat capability” that can bring astronauts back to Earth in the case of emergency. The first unmanned test flight will be carried out by SpaceX’s ‘Demonstration Mission 1’ in November, 2017, with a manned test flight scheduled for May 2018. Boeing’s ‘Orbital Flight Test’, an unmanned test will take place in June of 2018, with a manned test flight planned for August 2018. Once the test flights are complete and NASA certifies them for flight, human missions to the space station can begin. The new providers will take over from the Russian spacecraft Soyuz, which is currently the sole means of delivering crew to the ISS. In May 2016, Russia said it had no intention of renewing its contract to deliver US astronauts to the station after the current contract ends in 2018. "We are working with our partners under the effective contracts, but we have no plans for concluding new ones," said Sergey Saveliev, the deputy chief of Roscosmos. The intention to sever the relationship had been clearly indicated by NASA, which announced plans to give up Russia’s space travel services in lieu of home-grown spacecraft as far back as 2013.

An artist’s conception shows a straight-on view of Boeing’s CST-100 Starliner space taxi. (Boeing / NASA Photo) NASA has awarded four more contracts to Boeing and to SpaceX for space taxi trips to and from the International Space Station – dependent on certification that the spacecraft are safe. SpaceX is working on a crew-capable version of its Dragon capsule for NASA’s use, while Boeing is developing a capsule known as the CST-100 Starliner. Each company has already been given contracts for two flights; the contracts announced today brings the total trips to six for each. The space taxis haven’t yet been tested in flight. SpaceX has scheduled an uncrewed demonstration flight of its Crew Dragon to the space station in November, followed by a crewed flight test in May 2018. Boeing’s schedule calls for an uncrewed flight in June 2018 and a crewed flight test in August 2018. An artist’s conception shows SpaceX’s crew-capable Dragon approaching a port on the International Space Station with a cargo Dragon in the foreground. (NASA Photo) The demonstrations are covered under $6.8 billion in development contracts that NASA awarded in 2014. The 12 flights covered by the follow-up contracts would go ahead once the test flights are flown and NASA certifies the taxis. The post-certification contract awards do not require NASA to make any payments at this time, but they do provide Boeing and SpaceX with commitments that will help them plan for future needs. “Awarding these missions now will provide greater stability for the future space station crew rotation schedule, as well as reduce schedule and financial uncertainty for our providers,” Phil McAlister, director of NASA’s Commercial Spaceflight Development Division, said in a news release. “The ability to turn on missions as needed to meet the needs of the space station program is an important aspect of the Commercial Crew Program.” Since the space shuttle fleet’s retirement in 2011, NASA has had to depend on the Russians to ferry astronauts to and from the space station, at a cost that now amounts to more than $80 million per seat. SpaceX and Boeing say they can do the job for less. Each taxi flight calls for transporting up to four astronauts and about 220 pounds of critical cargo, either for scheduled crew rotation or in an emergency lifeboat situation. Both companies would launch from Florida’s Space Coast. Boeing would send the Starliner into orbit using a United Launch Alliance Atlas 5 rocket from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station’s Space Launch Complex 41, while SpaceX would launch its Crew Dragon from Kennedy Space Center’s Launch Pad 39A atop a Falcon 9 rocket. SpaceX could start using Pad 39A, which served as the departure point for Apollo moon missions and shuttle flights, for satellite launches as early as this month. Meanwhile, NASA is working on its own launch system for flights beyond Earth orbit. The first flight test of the heavy-lift Space Launch System is scheduled for late 2018. It’s due to send an uncrewed Orion space capsule around the moon and back. Crewed flights would follow in the 2020s.

The companies and NASA plan to make the images reality in 2018. (NASA) Print Email Lee Roop | lroop@al.com By Lee Roop | lroop@al.com The Huntsville Times Email the author | Follow on Twitter on January 04, 2017 at 10:36 AM comments NASA gave Boeing and SpaceX orders Tuesday for four more crew flights each to the International Space Station. The missions are part of $6.8 billion in contracts already awarded the companies in 2014, and the Boeing award is good news for Alabama. Huntsville Boeing employees are working on the company's crew capsule, and Decatur United Launch Alliance workers will build the Atlas V rocket it will ride to space. Neither capsule will be ready to fly before 2018, according to the latest reports. That means NASA will have to buy four more seats on Russia's Soyuz rocket this year for astronauts scheduled to go to the station. Those seats cost more than $80 million each, and Boeing and SpaceX say they can beat that price. SpaceX plans to test its Dragon crew capsule in November and fly a crew in May 2018. Boeing's CST-100 Starliner will fly uncrewed in June 2018 and with a crew in August 2018, according to Boeing's plans. These so-called space taxis must be able to transport up to four astronauts and 220 pounds of cargo. Both will launch from the Kennedy Space Center-Cape Canveral complex in Florida. NASA won't have to pay Boeing or SpaceX any more money now, but the award lets them move forward with more confidence. "Awarding these missions now will provide greater stability for the future space station crew rotation schedule, as well as reduce schedule and financial uncertainty for our providers," said Phil McAlister, director of NASA's Commercial Spaceflight Development Division. .  TALKING POLITICS Alabama/California Conversation Project We asked Alabama Trump voters to talk politics, values with California liberals Civic-minded Donald Trump voters in Alabama agreed to have a deep, serious, respectful conversation with Hillary Clinton voters from one of the most liberal places in America, the San Francisco Bay Area.

NASA has hired U.S. firms Boeing and SpaceX to ferry more astronauts to the International Space Station (ISS), with the first crewed test flight set for as early as May 2018. In 2014, both private firms entered in to a contract with NASA to carry out a space taxi service but were only offered two missions each. Now Boeing and SpaceX will get six missions each, but only if their technology can pass NASA certification. At present, NASA astronauts go to and from the space station on a Russian Soyuz spacecraft and have done since 2011when NASA last flew its space shuttle mission. "Awarding these missions now will provide greater stability for the future space station crew rotation schedule, as well as reduce schedule and financial uncertainty for our providers," said Phil McAlister, director, NASA's Commercial Spaceflight Development Division in a press release Tuesday. "The ability to turn on missions as needed to meet the needs of the space station program is an important aspect of the Commercial Crew Program," he said. NASA said Boeing's un-crewed flight test, known as an Orbital Flight Test, is currently scheduled for June 2018 and its crewed flight test set for August 2018. SpaceX progress is reportedly quicker with an unmanned flight test scheduled for November 2017, followed by a crew flight test penciled in for May 2018. Both companies are looking to launch their services from Florida's "Space Coast": Boeing from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station and SpaceX at NASA's Kennedy Space Center.

The contracts, announced under the space agency’s Commercial Crew Transportation Capability (CCtCap) program, bring the total number of missions awarded to SpaceX and Boeing to six each. “Awarding these missions now will provide greater stability for the future space station crew rotation schedule, as well as reduce schedule and financial uncertainty for our providers,” Phil McAlister, director of NASA’s commercial spaceflight development division, said in a statement. “The ability to turn on missions as needed to meet the needs of the space station program is an important aspect of the Commercial Crew Program.” SpaceX's first uncrewed flight test is scheduled for November 2017, and would be followed by its Crew Dragon capsule tests in May next year. Boeing, meanwhile, has scheduled the first crewed CST-100 Starliner test for August 2018.  Crewed missions to the ISS would begin once the companies receive flight certification from NASA. “The Commercial Crew Program will help NASA get full operational use from the national laboratory for scientific research by increasing the number of astronauts on the space station, and allowing the crew members to dedicate more time to research,” the space agency said in the statement. “The commercial crew vehicles will transport up to four astronauts for NASA missions, along with about 220 pounds of critical cargo to the space station.” Related Stories SpaceX Gets Another NASA Order For Crewed ISS Mission NASA Faces More Budget Cuts NASA on Wednesday awarded four more contracts each to SpaceX and Boeing for crewed flights to the International Space Station. Pictured: Artist's concept of the Crew Dragon capsule (left), and Boeing's CST-100 Starliner (right). Photo: NASA Since the U.S. ended its space shuttle program in 2011, Russia’s Soyuz rockets have the only means of ferrying astronauts to and from the ISS. Under its current arrangement, NASA has to shell out nearly $80 million for every seat on the Soyuz rocket.  However, last year, Russia’s Roscosmos announced that it does not have any plans to send U.S. astronauts to the ISS after 2018. This means that unless SpaceX or Boeing are ready with their flagship capsules by then, U.S. presence on the space station would be directly impacted — at least temporarily. “Returning human launch capabilities to U.S. soil underscores NASA’s commitment to the station and the research that the orbiting laboratory makes possible including the advancement of scientific knowledge off the Earth, for the benefit of those on the Earth and to prepare for future deep space exploration,” the space agency said.  Join the Discussion Most Read Everything You Need To Know, Right Now.

Trump is singling out corporate giants who he seems to think are behaving unpatriotically. He went after Boeing for overpricing the next generation Air Force One, they committed to lower the cost of the program. Then he went after Lockheed Martin maker of the Pentagon's F-35 fighter jet and pitted Boeing against them, asking Boeing to price out a cheaper version. On Tuesday, the CEO of Ford, a company frequently criticized by the President-elect for shifting production out of the country, announced they're scrapping plans for a new plant in Mexico and will instead build those cars in Michigan. Ford CEO Mark Fields says the move should be considered a vote of confidence in Trump's and the new Congress's pro-growth policies. But also Tuesday he went after GM for building cars in Mexico. I can't recall ever seeing this kind of pressure put on companies by a President, much less a President-elect, but people have said for years now this country should be run more like a business. I'm very curious to see how Trump translates this approach when it comes to our foreign relations.

Trump, who won the presidency in part with tough talk on trade, has shown his willingness to single out individual companies by name if they displease him, and Ford seems to be the latest to fall in line. Also yesterday, Trump nominated Reagan-era protectionist lawyer Robert Lighthizer to serve as US trade representative, signaling he intends to make good on pledges to renegotiate trade deals he blames for killing millions of American jobs. The moves likely will loom large over next week’s Detroit auto show, when the US industry’s top executives gather to show off their new models. The president-elect, who has previously taken to Twitter to slam Boeing and Lockheed Martin, made GM his latest target in a breakfast-hour tweet threatening to impose tariff on imports of a small number of Mexican-made Chevy Cruze models into the US. About-face at Ford A couple of hours later, Ford announced it was scuttling plans for a new US$1.6 billion (RM7.2 billion) factory in San Luis Potosi, and instead invest US$700 million over the next four years to expand its Flat Rock Assembly Plant in Michigan to build electric and self-driving vehicles. The Ford decision was an about-face after the second-biggest US automaker repeatedly rebuffed Trump’s criticism over its plans for the Mexico plant during and after the presidential campaign. Ford chief executive Mark Fields said the decision reflected the hope that Trump’s policies will boost the US manufacturing environment. “It’s literally a vote of confidence around some of the pro-growth policies that he has been outlining and that’s why we’re making this decision to invest here in the US and our plant here in Michigan,” Fields told CNN. He said company chairman Bill Ford spoke yesterday morning to Trump, and that he himself had spoken to Vice-President-elect Pence about the move, which Ford said would result in 700 new US jobs over four years. The new plant, announced in April, was expected to employ 2,800 by 2020. Mexico’s government said it “regrets” Ford’s decision, and that the company gave assurances it would repay “any expenditures made by the state government to facilitate this investment.” Another win for Trump? Trump took to Twitter again to crow about the Ford reversal: “Instead of driving jobs and wealth away, AMERICA will become the world’s great magnet for INNOVATION & JOB CREATION.” Ford’s decision creates a “political headline win for Trump, Ford and the UAW,” yet the diminished demand for small cars also makes it a positive decision in terms of business rationale, investment bank RBC Capital Markets said in a note. Meanwhile, GM responded to Trump’s Twitter attack with a statement emphasising that the vast majority of its Cruze cars sold in the US are made in Ohio, with just a small percentage imported from a plant across the southern border. “All Chevrolet Cruze sedans sold in the US are built in GM’s assembly plant in Lordstown, Ohio,” the auto giant said. Of 190,000 Cruze cars sold in the US, only 4,500 were hatchbacks made in Mexico, said a GM spokesman. Fully assembled Chevrolet Cruze cars at the General Motors assembly plant in Lordstown, Ohio July 22, 2011. — Reuters pic Trade war coming? Tough talk on trade helped Trump win election, and on the campaign trail he threatened to impose a 35 per cent import duty on cars produced in Mexico. He has also pledged to tear up the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico, blaming NAFTA and other trade agreements for the loss of millions of American manufacturing jobs. The appointment of Lighthizer as his top trade negotiator suggests Trump plans to follow through on that rhetoric.  Lighthizer served as deputy US trade representative in the Ronald Reagan administration in the 1980s, when the focus was on attacking Japan for its huge exports into the US market. But leading business lobbies such as the Business Roundtable have cautioned that US trading partners could retaliate against any new tariffs, threatening key US markets. “Any significant tariff increase within the North American region would impact the auto industry greatly and that just really makes the industry... much less competitive,” said Christopher Wilson, deputy director of Mexico Institute at the Wilson Centre, a Washington think tank. Automakers are also worried that Trump’s tough rhetoric towards China could trigger a full-scale trade war if the Republican makes good on threats to impose punitive tariffs on Beijing. — AFP                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week World’s eight richest as wealthy as half of humanity, Oxfam tells Davos Trump threatens BMW with border tax on cars built in Mexico Job cuts, fewer flights?

ROS LBoard 1 Racial politics not welcome in Johor, ruler warns Mahathir FMT Reporters Read More FMT BAHASA FMT BORNEO+ FMT VIDEO CONTRIBUTE NEWS HOME NATION OPINION WORLD LEISURE SPORTS BUSINESS ADVERTISE WITH US Boeing may lead search for MH370, says safety expert FMT Reporters | January 4, 2017 Report says it is likely private sector will take over search for missing airplane after Malaysia and other nations stop search operations by end January. KUALA LUMPUR: The search for MH370 will likely continue, says a safety consultant. John Goglia, a safety consultant and former member of the US National Transportation Safety Board, believes it will be carried out by the private sector, probably Boeing. Goglia was quoted in the magazine Popular Mechanics as saying that even though the official government funding for the search had run out, it did not mean the quest for answers was over. He said the search would continue, with Boeing most likely taking the lead. This is because MH370 was a Boeing 777. However the US manufacturer has yet to make any official statement on this. MH370 disappeared while on a routine flight from Beijing to Kuala Lumpur in March 2014 with 239 people on board. It is now the biggest aviation mystery. Although there is some evidence that a revised search zone may shed some light, the joint search operation by Malaysia, Australia, and China, led by the Australian Transport Safety Bureau, is due to end in January. A recent review by experts concluded that investigators may have been searching in the wrong place for MH370 all along. Malaysia, China and Australia have said they would stop the search operation by the end of January unless there was new and credible evidence that surfaced. The report said this decision had not only enraged families of the 239 people aboard MH370 but also aviation professionals, who argued that leaving a high-profile disaster unsolved was itself a threat to aviation safety. It quoted the president of the Australian Federation of Air Pilots, David Booth, as saying it was important to recover the wreckage of every single plane crash to determine the cause. He said the global aviation industry should rally to “fund a search of all feasible areas.” Meanwhile, Goglia was quoted by Popular Mechanics as saying the privately-funded search would be “smaller and more focused, but that’s probably better”. He noted the similarity to the 1987 crash of a South African Airways 747, also in the southern Indian Ocean. The plane was eventually recovered after years of searching from depths of 4,900 metres. The report hinted that politics was also at play in air crash searches and investigations involving non-Western nations. Goglia was quoted as saying: “Most Western countries have laws designed to keep politics out of air crash investigations. But that is not the case in much of the rest of the world.” Comments Readers are required to have a valid Facebook account to comment on this story.

(Photo: AP/Elaine Thompson) Beginning in 1979 in Seattle, WA, Jim Levitt expertly fabricated custom aircraft parts and tools, helping make the Boeing Company one of the most successful businesses in the world. But in 2013, corporate executives issued a threat: They demanded that Levitt and his fellow machinists surrender their pensions, and that Washington State political leaders hand over a record $8.7 billion in tax benefits. In exchange the company promised to keep production jobs in-state. The Democratic governor of Washington, along with virtually the entire political establishment, caved in to the blackmail. So did Levitt’s international union leadership – they had bargained the deal secretly with the company. The capitulation cost 32,000 Boeing workers their pensions. “We’ve lost collective bargaining, for all intents and purposes,” Levitt observed in the wake of the corporate blackmail. In recent weeks we’ve seen no shortage of reasons – and excuses – for why Hillary Clinton blew the election and Donald Trump will be our next president: the Russians, an unfair Electoral College system, FBI Director James Comey, xenophobia/racism/sexism, a weak Democratic candidate, Wikileaks, and faked news. Some Clinton backers even blame the “tough” primary run that Bernie Sanders gave their candidate. What’s barely given any attention in the mainstream media is the role that decades of destruction of union power played in the 2016 election debacle. But it’s no mystery to Levitt, his fellow Boeing workers, and millions of other workers from all walks of life who’ve justifiably grown cynical about a political establishment that repeatedly has failed them over the years. Today, overall union membership is at its lowest point in more than 70 years. In the private sector, a paltry 1 in 15 workers holds a union card. Now it will get worse: Public sector unions are bracing for the inevitable Supreme Court decision allowing “freeloading” – requiring unions to let workers avoid paying any dues while still receiving full union representation and protection. The incoming Congress promises to be hostile to worker organizations, eager to do on a national scale what Gov. Scott Walker has done to Wisconsin unions. Underscoring labor’s weakness, the election results produced the most anemic union turnout for the Democratic presidential candidate in more than 30 years: Clinton won union households by only 51 to 43 percent, an 8 percent margin. In the previous 7 presidential elections, in contrast, the Democrat won union households by an average margin of 22 percent. But it would be facile simply to blame Hillary Clinton for failing to inspire confidence and for running a bad campaign, or to credit Donald Trump for successfully tapping into the anger and frustration of working-class white voters and manipulating racism, sexism, and xenophobia to his benefit. That would tell only half of the story. The other half of the story is that past and present union leaders – like the top Machinist union leadership in 2013 – contributed to our current circumstances. The unraveling didn’t just happen suddenly. Over the last several decades, most leaders failed to lead in a bold, visionary direction to inspire millions to build power through collective organizing and action. Instead they clung to outdated assumptions about labor-management relations and remained stubbornly tethered to a political duopoly that has bestowed on us outsourced and exported jobs, stagnant wages, precarious employment schemes, terminated pension plans, rising health care costs, and an eviscerated social safety net. Most unions focused inward, instead of reaching out. Leaders thought their compromises were protecting good jobs, when in fact they were emboldening hostile corporate adversaries. Today, as union members and leaders, we find ourselves in a dead-end alley, surrounded by thugs brandishing crowbars and long knives. But we didn’t just get chased into the corner; too many unions went here willingly. To the extent that we recognize how we got here, we can begin to fight our way out of this corner. But it will be a tough fight. It will require us to reimagine the nature and role of unions, to discard failed strategies and assumptions, and to embrace new, deep labor-community-faith alliances. ~~~ Go back to the end of World War II: Union membership soared during the war, reaching a third of all workers. In the core of the nation’s economy, the manufacturing sector, fully 69 percent of production workers were covered by union agreements. Militant strikes during and right after the war pushed demands for a greater share of the economic pie along with social demands. In 1946 alone, 4.6 million workers went on strike – about 1 in every 20 in the paid US workforce. But rather than build on that nascent power, most union leaders determined to make peace with political and business elites, believing – incorrectly – that the tripartite domestic détente of World War II was still alive. Even before Senator Joe McCarthy’s witch hunts, unions started purging communists and other suspected radicals from their ranks, seeking to demonstrate their loyalty to government and business. The leadership of the labor federation that emerged in the 1950s, the AFL-CIO, steered away from organizing more workers. Federation president George Meany famously declared, “I used to worry about the size of the membership. I stopped worrying because to me it doesn’t make any difference. The organized fellow is the only fellow that counts.” Most union leaders focused on securing economic gains for their members, tamping down militant insurgency in the ranks and pledging allegiance to the capitalist economic system in exchange for collective bargaining agreements. The bargaining system has worked splendidly – at least for those fortunate to be covered by a union contract. By the new millennium, the average union member could expect to make 25 percent more than a worker not covered by a union contract. But flip side of the “union difference” touted proudly by so many was that it presented a huge incentive for corporate and political elites to attack union power, motivating them to accelerate union-busting, outsourcing, contracting out, and passing laws to hamstring unions. Most unions, in turn, focused defensively on protecting what they had, failing to appreciate that the antidote to the business offensive required organizing more workers into union ranks and fighting to raise benefits for all, not just some. Despite organizing initiatives by a few unions in recent years, the overall percentage of union members in the workforce has plunged from a post WWII high of 33 percent to barely 11 percent today. Worse, as union power ebbed and the American Dream of upward mobility slipped away, most union leaders clung reflexively to the Democratic Party for salvation. In 1976 they backed Jimmy Carter for president, expecting to win labor laws that would make organizing easier. Instead, Carter and an overwhelmingly Democratic Congress handed corporate America the tools to dismantle worker power: Trucking, railroad, and airline deregulation, along with new bankruptcy laws that authorized businesses to break union contracts and eliminate pensions. In 1992 unions counted on Bill Clinton to deliver jobs, but instead he pushed the job-killing North American Free Trade Agreement and eviscerated the nation’s welfare system. Even as workers became more productive, real wages stagnated. In 2008 labor had high hopes that Barack Obama would save workers but instead Wall Street got bailed out while nearly 9 million workers were fired, 14 million families lost their homes, and the president invested more political capital in promoting another horrible trade agreement – the Trans Pacific Partnership – than in backing modest labor law reform or a raise in the national minimum wage. Under Obama, union ranks have declined by another half a million workers, and US inequality has reached epic levels. In just the 24 months following the official end of the Great Recession in 2009, the gap in wealth between the richest 7 percent of households and the rest of us grew by $6.6 trillion. Even an immediate national minimum wage hike to $15 – obviously fantastical in today’s political reality – would offset just a tiny fraction of that recent growth in wealth disparity. Given all of that, the 2016 surprise isn’t that workers abandoned Democrats at the ballot box. Rather, the shocker is this: Why the heck didn’t they ditch them a lot sooner? For the last several decades we’ve had labor leaders who counseled union members to make pragmatic political choices, warning that the alternative to mediocre candidates was a lot worse. That was certainly true this past fall. But if there’s any single takeaway about working class voters in the 2016 campaign – from Bernie Sanders’s remarkable insurgency to Donald Trump’s brutal and ugly win – it’s a rejection of the establishment of both major political parties and the narrow mindset of lesser-evilism. Workers deserve better. The salvation of unions, and more generally, of the US working class, resides not in struggling to fix a broken national Democratic Party that repeatedly has betrayed workers, but in joining with allies to fight the coming Trump onslaught – and then to go beyond that to define a bold, unapologetic vision of society and economy, one that inspires millions of workers to engage and take action. This fight isn’t about blue states vs. red states, urban vs. rural, immigrant vs. native-born – all false frames that are intentionally deployed to divide and weaken working people – but about the 99 percent against the billionaire class and their political allies. It’s a fight about power and our societal values. For those of us in unions, it means we have to use all of the tools at our disposal to defend what we still have – at the bargaining table, on the shop floor, and in legislative halls – but then go beyond to forge new powerful community alliances to demand health care, quality education, civil rights, food and shelter, and fair wages for all. Indeed, the pinnacle achievements of US unions – think social security, minimum wages, safety laws – took place when labor acted not out of narrow self-interest, but as part of a broad social movement; not as a co-dependent of a political party, but as an independent force in politics. In other parts of the world, particularly among societies in the global south, such formations are called social movement unions: Bold movements that recognize the singular nature of a justice fight spanning workplace and community, and the inseparability of the fights for economic, racial, and social justice. Here’s some good news: The elements of social movement unionism already are among us, embedded in the leading justice struggles today. Chicago teachers have struck to defend the bedrock principle of quality public education for all, and in doing so have united with parents to push back against the corporatization of our schools. Uber and other rideshare drivers have organized strikes to demand new laws protecting their right to organize. Several unions, including the Service Employees International Union, the Communications Workers of America, and National Nurses United, built important new alliances when they stood with the Standing Rock Sioux’s efforts to stop the Dakota Access Pipeline. In the city of SeaTac, just south of Seattle, low-wage immigrant airport workers, Muslim and Christian faith activists, and community members took on an improbable battle against corporate and political giants to organize a breakthrough $15 ballot initiative, helping to spark a national movement. (I was privileged to have been the campaign director.) In North Carolina and beyond, the Rev. William J. Barber II has united faith leaders, union members, and immigration-rights activists in a powerful Moral Mondays movement to reclaim democracy and raise the call for a moral economy. What connects these varied efforts is the common awareness that the fight is not just about workplace issues, but is about societal values, and that through unity and struggle a better world is possible. Also common to these fights is the recognition that a potent, sustained movement must rest on more than economic and political principles. It also must draw upon the values that emanate from our deepest human emotions and desires for justice and community. The call for spiritual morality, whether advanced by organized religion or secular humanist yearnings, has played a decisive role in leading struggles throughout history. The civil rights movement of the 1950s and ’60s and the abolitionist movement of a century earlier are but two examples of struggles that were propelled forward by powerful calls for spiritual morality. Today, the embryonic movements that fuse direct action with a spiritually based call for justice offer similar promise. None of these examples, of course, represents a full-fledged social movement union. But each contains at least a rudimentary recognition that the fight is about power, each recognizes the need to build broad alliances of the 99 percent, to disrupt convention and circumvent broken law, and each contains bold strategies that we can employ in building a formidable new labor movement. And, importantly, each of these campaigns challenges unions to think differently about their role in the world – to act expansively, to link arms with new friends, and to articulate a bold vision of justice. Back at Boeing, Levitt retired right after the 2013 pension debacle but his union colleagues went on to take steps to reclaim power and voice: They forced the retirement of their international union president, who had promoted the pension giveaway; secured a new membership bill of rights within their union; and stepped up organizing at Boeing contractors. Our job in 2017 and beyond is to nurture and build on these promising movements, challenging ourselves and others to think bigger and bolder, to focus not just on winning discrete campaigns, but on building a movement that has a moral foundation and vision. Indeed, the gift that Trump’s ascension gives us – perverse as that may sound – is that his victory strips away any illusions about the depth of organized labor’s existential crisis. Now there is no question that our collective backs are against the wall, and the only way forward is to fight back by uniting broadly and reclaiming the movement’s larger social purpose to lift up the dignity and value of all working people. © 2017 Tikkun Jonathan Rosenblum Jonathan Rosenblum is a union and community organizer living in Seattle, WA.

SCOUT Sign In Share & Embed New Navy Osprey Variant Brings Longer Range, New Radios Kris Osborn 01/03/2017 / Originally published onWarrior The new Navy Osprey will have a longer range, improved radios and greater fuel carrying capacity than the existing Osprey. It will both hover like a helicopter and reach airplane speeds as fast as 280mph. The Navy is in the early stages of building its own variant of the V-22 Osprey tiltrotor aircraft to perform its critical Carrier-Onboard-Delivery mission to delivery forces, supplies and weapons to forward-stationed ships at sea. The service plans to procure 44 new CMV-22B Ospreys for the COD mission, replacing the 1960’s era C-2 Greyhound aircraft. The C-2 Greyhound is a twin-engine, high-wing cargo aircraft first introduced in the 1960s. Since that time, 35 C-2s have been in the Navy inventory, service officials said. Unlike the C-2 fixed wing aircraft, which requires a catapult to lift off of the deck of a carrier, the Osprey tiltrotor can both reach airplane speeds of 220mph and also hover like a helicopter such that it can come in for vertical landings on the carrier deck. “280mph is the maximum speed,” Rick Lemaster, Director for Business Development, Bell Boeing, told Scout Warrior in an interview.    The Navy has contracted Bell-Boeing to develop the engineering changes needed to meet this range requirement, as well as the other changes, to enable the CMV-22B to fulfill Navy's COD mission.  New Technologies for the Navy Osprey The new Navy Osprey variant will be engineered with some new technologies and additional fuel carrying capacity to achieve a longer range than the existing MV-22 Marine Corps Osprey, however the Navy and Bell-Boeing are taking special measure to maximize commonality between the two services’ variants.  “Bell-Boeing will examine various methods to meet the range requirement, including additional fuel and how to carry it. The solution will be incorporated as a "cut-in production" engineering change to the MV-22B, producing the CMV-22B,” Navy spokesman Ensign Marc Rockwellpate told Scout Warrior. The Navy’s Osprey will add more than 200 miles to the Nautical range of the existing Corps' variant of the aircraft in order to extend its reach out to sea on-board aircraft carriers and amphibious assault ships. “The Navy's operational range requirement for the Carrier Onboard Delivery mission is 1,150 nautical miles.  This is required to provide long range aerial logistics support of the Seabase, and reflects an increase of approximately 200 nautical miles to the baseline MV-22B,” Rockwellpate said.  The new Osprey, slated to first be operational by 2021, will perform the full range of missions currently executed by the C-2s. This includes VIP transport, humanitarian relief mission and regular efforts to deliver food, spare parts and equipment for sailors aboard carriers. Also, C-2 aircraft has a reconfigurable cargo bay which can create space for 12-stretchers for medical evacuation and transport. The existing Corps MV-22 Osprey is also known for what is called "mounted vertical maneuver" wherein Marines use the speed, range and maneuverability of the Osprey to fly in behind enemy lines, land vertically and conduct a range of operations, including assisting amphibious missions. The Osprey can transport Marines, equipment and weapons systems with a combat radius of 450 miles. The new, in-development Navy variant will extend this combat radius to allow for ocean transport of supplies, equipment and weapons to assets on the open seas far from shore. The aircraft can also move important cargo between ships such as carriers and amphibs.  In addition, the Osprey is being developed as a tanker aircraft able to perform aerial refueling missions; the idea is to transport fuel and use a probe technology to deliver fuel to key aircraft such as an F/A-18 or F-35C.  The first Navy Ospreys will be procured in 2018 with some early “long-lead” items acquired in 2017, Lemaster said. Some of the requirements for the new aircraft have already been established, there are other still in the process of being determined and refined. “The Navy Osprey will have increased range and we are still working toward the engineered changes that will give them all the requirements and range they are looking for,” Brian Roby, Bell Field Manager, San Diego, told Scout Warrior in an interview.   While the Navy’s aerial delivery mission does not require an armed aircraft, there will be occasions which require the aircraft to operate from forward bases in a higher threat environment, Rockwellpate said.   The Marine Corps, however, is in the early stages of determining requirements to arm their MV-22 Osprey with rockets or other kinds of weapons.  “In order to decrease this risk, the CMV-22B will retain the MV-22B's survivability systems, which include a missile warning system as well as chaff and flares,” Rockwellpate explained. The CMV-22B will also be configured with a high frequency radio to provide a redundant "Beyond line of Sight" safety of flight communications capability, reducing risk during long-range over-water flights to an underway Carrier Strike Group, he added.  “They are looking at all the requirements still. It’s going to have as a minimum as 400 cubic feet. What we have is about 439 cubic feet,” Roby said.  Also, in order to successfully perform the long-range aerial logistics support mission, the CMV-22B must be interoperable with US and international civil aviation and military air traffic management systems.  In preparation for these developments, the Navy’s Atlantic Fleet completed a military utility assessment several years ago wherein they conducted Osprey flights from Mayport, Fla., and Norfolk, Va., to the USS Harry Truman out at sea. The idea for the flights was to assess the viability of the V-22 Osprey to perform COD missions to and from the deck of the aircraft carrier, Navy officials said.

Boeing recently delivered the 500th jet of the series. Advertisement Boeing Commercial Airplanes (Boeing Corp IW500/9) has settled terms with Delta Air after the carrier cancelled an order for 18 Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner jets, a contract worth $4 billion at current list prices. Delta had inherited the purchase commitment from Northwest Airlines, the rival carrier it acquired in a $2.6-billion share-exchange in 2008.  Subsequently, in 2010, Delta negotiated a deferred delivery on the planes until after 2020.

While Delta also deferred delivery for four Airbus A350s earlier this year, from 2018 to 2019-2020, it still has orders for 25 of those widebody jets, as well as 25 A330neo jets.

Photo: AP mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 10:35 PM, January 3, 2017 NEW YORK — Mr Donald Trump has singled out a number of companies individually before and after winning the US presidential election. Here’s a quick rundown of the businesses he’s targeted and what he has said: AMAZON “If (at)amazon ever had to pay fair taxes, its stock would crash and it would crumble like a paper bag. The (at)washingtonpost scam is saving it!” Mr Trump tweeted on Dec 7, 2015. CARRIER “Big day on Thursday for Indiana and the great workers of that wonderful state. We will keep our companies and jobs in the US Thanks Carrier.” Mr Trump tweeted on Nov. 29, 2016. FORD MOTOR “Just got a call from my friend Bill Ford, Chairman of Ford, who advised me that he will be keeping the Lincoln plant in Kentucky — no Mexico. I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me!” Mr Trump said in a series of tweets on Nov 17, 2016. LOCKHEED MARTIN AND BOEING “Based on the tremendous cost and cost overruns of the Lockheed Martin F-35, I have asked Boeing to price-out a comparable F-18 Super Hornet!” Mr Trump tweeted on Dec 22, 2016. “Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than US$4 billion (S$5.8 billion). Cancel order!” Mr Trump tweeted on Dec 6, 2016. GENERAL MOTORS “General Motors is sending Mexican made model of Chevy Cruze to US car dealers-tax free across border. Make in USA or pay big border tax!” Mr Trump tweeted on Jan 3, 2017. MACY’S “Good news, disloyal (at)Macys stock is in a total free fall. Don’t shop there for Christmas!” Mr Trump tweeted on Dec 4, 2015. T-MOBILE US “.(at)JohnLegere (at)TMobile John, focus on running your company, I think the service is terrible! Try hiring some good managers.” Mr Trump tweeted on Nov 15, 2015. REXNORD “Rexnord of Indiana is moving to Mexico and rather viciously firing all of its 300 workers. This is happening all over our country. No more!” Mr Trump tweeted on Dec 2, 2016. BUSINESSES IN GENERAL “The US is going to substantially reduce taxes and regulations on businesses, but any business that leaves our country for another country, fires its employees builds a new factory or plant in the other country, and then thinks it will sell its product back into the US...without retribution or consequence, is WRONG! There will be a tax on our soon to be strong border of 35% for these companies...wanting to sell their product, cars, A.C. units, etc., back across the border. This tax will make leaving financially difficult, but...but these companies are able to move between all 50 states and negotiate a tax free deal! Our country cannot keep losing these jobs, & won’t. These companies are able to move between all 50 states, with no tax or tariff being charged. Please be forewarned prior to making a very....expensive mistake! THE UNITED STATES IS OPEN FOR BUSINESS.” Mr Trump said in a series of tweets on Dec 4, 2016.

Here’s a quick rundown of the businesses he’s targeted and what he has said. Amazon “If @amazon ever had to pay fair taxes, its stock would crash and it would crumble like a paper bag. The @washingtonpost scam is saving it!” Trump tweeted on Dec. 7, 2015. OPM tells DC-area feds how to plan for Inauguration Day Carrier Advertisement “Big day on Thursday for Indiana and the great workers of that wonderful state. We will keep our companies and jobs in the U.S. Thanks Carrier.” Trump tweeted on Nov. 29, 2016. Ford Motor Co. “Just got a call from my friend Bill Ford, Chairman of Ford, who advised me that he will be keeping the Lincoln plant in Kentucky – no Mexico. I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me!” Trump said in a series of tweets on Nov. 17, 2016 Lockheed Martin Corp. and Boeing Co. “Based on the tremendous cost and cost overruns of the Lockheed Martin F-35, I have asked Boeing to price-out a comparable F-18 Super Hornet!” Trump tweeted on Dec. 22, 2016. “Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!” Trump tweeted on Dec. 6, 2016. General Motors Co. “General Motors is sending Mexican made model of Chevy Cruze to U.S. car dealers-tax free across border. Make in U.S.A. or pay big border tax!” Trump tweeted on Jan. 3, 2017. Macy’s Inc. “Good news, disloyal @Macys stock is in a total free fall. Don’t shop there for Christmas!” Trump tweeted on Dec. 4, 2015. T-Mobile US .@JohnLegere @TMobile John, focus on running your company, I think the service is terrible! Try hiring some good managers. Trump tweeted on Nov. 15, 2015 Rexnord “Rexnord of Indiana is moving to Mexico and rather viciously firing all of its 300 workers. This is happening all over our country. No more!” Trump tweeted on Dec. 2, 2016. Businesses in General “The U.S. is going to substantialy reduce taxes and regulations on businesses, but any business that leaves our country for another country, fires its employees builds a new factory or plant in the other country, and then thinks it will sell its product back into the U.S….without retribution or consequence, is WRONG! There will be a tax on our soon to be strong border of 35% for these companies…wanting to sell their product, cars, A.C. units, etc., back across the border. This tax will make leaving financially difficult, but…but these companies are able to move between all 50 states and negotiate a tax free deal! Our country cannot keep losing these jobs, & won’t. These companies are able to move between all 50 states, with no tax or tariff being charged. Please be forewarned prior to making a very….expensive mistake! THE UNITED STATES IS OPEN FOR BUSINESS.” Trump said in a series of tweets on Dec. 4, 2016.

By MarketWatch As the likes of Boeing BA, +0.34% and Lockheed Martin LMT, +0.76% learned previously, and GM, -0.45% discovered today, catching the attention of President-elect Donald Trump is not necessarily great news for a company or its shareholders, at least in the near term. For stock-market pros, it’s created a brave new world, as Peter Andersen, chief investment officer at Fiduciary Trust Co., told MarketWatch early Tuesday. ‘Trump is making it both easy and difficult for stock pickers. We’re getting surgical precision when it comes to commentary on specific companies, but we’re still getting our sea legs with how to interpret this data.

President-elect Donald Trump has laid out a sweeping defense and foreign policy agenda, from calling for a major defense buildup to vowing to quickly defeat the Islamic State to promising warmer relations with Russia. And his actions since Election Day have shown the defense world the unexpected, as he's gone on Twitter to go after the two biggest U.S. defense contractors, Lockheed Martin and Boeing.” Here are six big defense issues we’re watching in the new year: Story Continued Below — The budget: Republican defense hawks will almost certainly push for major increases in defense spending. Trump has pledged to embark on a massive military buildup while congressional Republicans have long pushed to end the caps on Pentagon spending set by the Budget Control Act. —Trump vs. defense industry: Trump has quickly made clear it won’t be business as usual for the defense industry in his administration. The president-elect has used his Twitter to target both Lockheed Martin and Boeing, slamming Lockheed’s F-35 program and Boeing’s new Air Force One. — Mattis as Defense secretary: Once James Mattis is confirmed as Trump’s Pentagon chief — despite the issues surrounding the legislative waiver he needs, Mattis’ confirmation is a near-lock — the key question is how the blunt-talking, retired four-star Marine general navigates within the Trump administration. — Fighting the Islamic State: Guided by a secret plan he says he's not ready to reveal, Trump has promised to quickly defeat the Islamic State abroad and to root out radicalism at home. Trump announced on the campaign trail he wants top military leaders to formulate a plan within 30 days of his administration to defeat the terrorist group. — Trump vs. McCain: Senate Armed Services Chairman John McCain is poised to play a chief Republican foil to Trump. The Arizona senator has called for a Select Committee in Congress to investigate Russia’s meddling in the presidential campaign — a notion Trump contests. Still, McCain could be an ally for Trump on some issues, particularly Pentagon acquisition. — Guantanamo Bay: The fight over President Barack Obama’s effort to shutter the U.S. military prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, is likely to fizzle under Trump, who opposes closing Guantanamo. But it’s unclear if he plans to resume sending prisoners there. On the campaign trail, Trump pledged he’d “load it up with some bad dudes. WHAT TO WATCH THIS WEEK — SASC TEES UP RUSSIA CYBER HEARING AHEAD OF INAUGURATION DAY: Senate Armed Services Chairman John McCain is wasting no time in the new Congress taking on the president-elect on Russia. The Arizona Republican has scheduled a hearing on cyber threats for Thursday, where Russia's election-year hacking will take center stage. Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, National Security Agency and Cyber Command chief Adm. Mike Rogers and Undersecretary of Defense for Intelligence Marcel Lettre are scheduled to testify. McCain and his Senate ally, Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), toured eastern Europe over the past week, with a visit to Ukraine on Monday where they slammed Russian President Vladimir Putin. After the Obama administration announced sanctions against Russia last week over the election-year hacking, McCain and Graham said they’d push for even stronger ones in the new Congress. — TRUMP SET TO GET HIS OWN SPECIAL INTEL BRIEFING THIS WEEK: While Trump has continued to dispute the U.S. intelligence conclusions that Russia was behind the election-year hacking of the Democratic National Committee, he’s supposed to get a special intelligence briefing this week. Asked about the hacking at a Mar-a-Lago New Year’s party in Florida, Trump told reporters he knows "things that other people don't know. And so they cannot be sure of the situation." Asked what he knows, Trump said: "You'll find out on Tuesday or Wednesday." FOR YOUR RADAR — SASC’S MATTIS GAME PLAN: The Senate Armed Services panel is facing double duty with the confirmation of Mattis as Defense secretary — considering his nomination in addition to the congressional waiver allowing him to serve as Pentagon chief as a recently retired Marine general. To accomplish that, the panel is planning a Jan. 10 hearing without outside experts on civilian control of the military, according to sources familiar with the committee’s planning. Then, the committee plans to hold Mattis’ confirmation hearing on Jan. 12, although Democrats may yet object to that schedule over their demands not to hold simultaneous confirmation hearings for Trump’s Cabinet picks. Following that hearing, the committee intends to mark up the waiver to send it to the Senate floor. The goal, according to one source, is to have the waiver completed before Jan. 20, when Trump is sworn in and will officially nominate Mattis for the Pentagon post.

It’s gonna be a very busy new year, so keep the tips, pitches and feedback coming at jherb@politico.com, and follow on Twitter @jeremyherb, @morningdefense and @politicopro. HAPPENING TODAY — THE NEW CONGRESS IS SWORN IN: The 115th Congress is officially sworn in today, kicking off the beginning of Republican-dominated government in Washington. The new Congress has teed up a lengthy to-do list, with confirmation battles, a Republican assault on Obamacare— and, more than likely, hints of Republican infighting to come, report our colleagues Rachael Bade and Elana Schor. As their first action, House Republicans voted Monday evening to gut their own ethics watchdog that was set up after the Jack Abramoff scandal. NEW YEAR, NEW VIOLENCE CLAIMED BY ISIL: A gunman attacked a Turkish nightclub on New Year’s Eve, and dozens were killed in a Baghdad market bombing on Monday. And the Islamic State claimed both attacks. More here on the deadly Istanbul slaying from The Washington Post’s Erin Cunningham and Heda Habib: “The Islamic State claimed responsibility Monday for a deadly rampage at an Istanbul nightclub on New Year’s Eve, an assault by a single gunman that killed dozens of people and served as a brutal reminder of the consequences of Turkey’s expanding war with the jihadists in Syria. A statement posted online said that a ‘heroic soldier of the caliphate’ had attacked the nightclub with grenades and a rifle in ‘revenge for God’s religion’ and in response to orders from the Islamic State’s leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, who recently urged his followers to attack Turkey.” Turkey arrests 12 in connection with the nightclub shooting and vowed to “speedily” identify the suspect, reports the BBC. — SUICIDE BOMBER HITS BAGHDAD MARKET, via The Associated Press: “A suicide bomber driving a pickup loaded with explosives struck a bustling market in Baghdad on Monday, killing at least 36 people in an attack claimed by the Islamic State group hours after French President Francois Hollande arrived in the Iraqi capital. The bomb went off in a fruit and vegetable market that was packed with day laborers, a police officer said, adding that another 52 people were wounded.” KIM JONG UN’S NEW YEAR’S RESOLUTION — A MISSILE THAT CAN HIT U.S., and experts warn the North Korean’s leader’s threat is plausible, reports Reuters’ James Pearson: “North Korea has been working through 2016 on developing components for an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), making the isolated nation's claim that it was close to a test-launch plausible, international weapons experts said on Monday. "North Korea has been testing rocket engines and heat-shields for an ICBM while developing the technology to guide a missile after re-entry into the atmosphere following a lift-off, the experts said. While Pyongyang is close to a test, it is likely to take some years to perfect the weapon.” — TRUMP TWEETS ‘IT WON’T HAPPEN!,’ though the president-elect didn’t elaborate beyond 140 characters, via our colleague Rebecca Morin: “President-elect Donald Trump tweeted Monday evening that North Korea won't reach the final stages of developing a nuclear weapon that will be able to hit the United States. ‘North Korea just stated that it is in the final stages of developing a nuclear weapon capable of reaching parts of the U.S. It won't happen!’ the president-elect wrote.” INDUSTRY INTEL — SPACEX PLANS TO LAUNCH AGAIN, writes The Wall Street Journal: “Elon Musk’s Space Exploration Technologies Corp. said it plans to resume rocket launches on Jan. 8, using revised operational practices developed in response to a fiery accident that occurred during routine ground preparations last fall. The tentative blastoff date for the Falcon 9 from California’s Vandenberg Air Force Base is subject to results of testing later this week, industry officials said, and still could change.” MAKING MOVES, TRUMP TEAM EDITION: The president-elect is expected to name Marc Short, a top adviser to Vice President-elect Mike Pence, to lead the White House legislative affairs shop, reports POLITICO’s Shane Goldmacher. Rick Dearborn, executive director of the presidential transition and a longtime chief of staff to Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), was originally in line for the legislative affairs post, but is now expected to be named a deputy White House chief of staff. Trump this morning also named Robert Lighthizer, a veteran trade attorney and supporter of Trump's defensive view of trade, as his pick for the next U.S. trade representative. But in Trump’s quest for a VA secretary both Luis Quinonez and Toby Cosgrove have withdrawn from consideration, reports Leo Shane of the Military Times.

Bush has not phoned his successor once removed with a crisp message, he should do so immediately. Six words are enough. "Donald, you are not president yet!" And, the 43rd president might have added, "And please do a little more homework before sounding off." The intervention of Trump via Twitter and MSNBC anchor Mika Brzezinski into the most vital and potentially existential national security issues is, at best, unhelpful. These tweets followed the post- election congratulatory phone calls Trump accepted from the Taiwan president and Pakistani prime minister. The first called into question the 45-year-old "one China policy." The second provoked India. More seriously, Trump has called for "greatly strengthening and expanding" our nuclear weapons and boasted about winning a nuclear arms race against Russia; rejected the Obama administration's abstention of a U.N. Security Council resolution condemning Israel for expanding settlements into the occupied territories; and threatened two major defense contractors -- Boeing over the cost of the next Air Force One and Lockheed Martin over the huge cost growth of the F-35 Lightning II fifth-generation fighter. Since Dwight Eisenhower promised to go to Korea to end that war in 1952, no other president-elect has imposed himself so dramatically on the political scene as has Trump. The president-elect has done this with 140 characters rather than press conferences or written op-ed pieces. Serious people worry whether these interventions help or hurt American security, especially when each appears to be an instinctive rather than a well thought-out response. And many fear this style of instant reaction is indicative of what will be a very active presidential bull in a very fragile china shop. Concerning the need for fuller understanding and knowledge of the issues, consider the tweets about nuclear weapons and the costs of Air Force One and the F-35 Lightning. During the campaign, Trump did not seem to understand what the nuclear triad of land, sea and air deterrent forces was or meant. Nor did he acknowledge that both Russia and America have signed the New START treaty limiting both sides to 1,550 strategic launchers and about 5,000 warheads. If Trump was reacting to Russian President Vladimir Putin's meeting with his senior military leaders in which Putin vowed to make Russian strategic nuclear capabilities sufficient to defeat the West's defensive anti-ballistic systems, did he appreciate the argument the Russian president was making? The answer appears to be no. Regarding Boeing and Air Force One, while the company's CEO Dennis Muilenberg pledged to keep the cost below $4 billion, that is not his or Boeing's call. It is the White House that sets Air Force One's requirements to protect the president from all dangers whether kinetic or electronic that drive costs. In prompting Boeing for an F-18 Super Hornet alternative to the F-35, did anyone advise the president that such a request had been made before and proved to be unworkable? Or did Trump know that only the Navy and Marines fly the F-18 not the Air Force? And did anyone inform the chief executive-to-be that eight other nations are planning to buy or have bought F-35s so that cuts to the program could be disastrous for this coalition? But suppose Trump had taken a different tack based on a fuller understanding of these issues. He could have reminded Putin that Ronald Reagan helped bankrupt the Soviet Union with the Strategic Defense Initiative. That tweet might have said: "Vlad, Star Wars broke you last time. Don't force us to do it again!" About Air Force One, a tweet might have read: "$4 billion for AF One is outrageous. We will ensure the price is right." And instead of trying to leverage Lockheed Martin's F-35 costs with an upgraded Super Hornet, the next commander-in-chief could have proposed: "Unmanned aerial vehicles are smart, effective and can create jobs. Boeing and Lockheed, what can you do about that?" Whatever one thinks of the president-elect, the greater challenge is not to make America great again. The challenge is to confront and fix the myriad problems, many irrational and self-imposed by a government in gridlock, that got Trump elected in the first place. Instinct is important provided it is headed in the proper direction. Instinct based on fuller knowledge and understanding is even better. Perhaps the 43rd and 44th presidents can pass that message to the 45th. Harlan Ullman is a senior adviser at Washington D.C.'s Atlantic Council and chairman of two private companies. His next book, due out next year, is "Anatomy of Failure: Why America Loses Wars It Starts," which argues that failure to know and to understand the circumstances in which force is used guarantees failure.

Here's what it means for both companies. Adam Levine-Weinberg (TMFGemHunter) Jan 3, 2017 at 8:10AM More than a decade ago, Northwest Airlines ordered 18 787-8 Dreamliners from Boeing (NYSE:BA), becoming the aircraft's North American launch customer. However, this order has been on the rocks ever since Northwest merged with Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL). In 2010, in a bid to slash capital spending, Delta deferred all of its 787 deliveries to 2020 and beyond. In late 2014, it ordered 50 modern widebodies from Airbus (NASDAQOTH:EADSY) -- with deliveries scheduled to begin in 2017 -- casting more doubt on its continued interest in the Dreamliner. Delta has ordered dozens of widebodies from Airbus recently. Image source: Delta Air Lines. Last week, Delta Air Lines took the final step, officially canceling its entire order for 18 787-8 Dreamliners. Delta pulls the trigger Delta's decision to cancel its Dreamliner order had been anticipated by airline analysts for many years. When Delta ordered the 737-900ER narrowbody plane from Boeing several years ago, it negotiated the right to substitute those 737-900ER orders for its existing Dreamliner orders on a dollar-for-dollar basis. This unusual agreement may explain the timing of the order cancellation announcement. Based on Boeing's current price list, 18 787-8 Dreamliners would be roughly equivalent in price to 40 737-900ERs. Given that Delta only has 51 remaining orders for 737-900ERs, it may have been running out of time to cancel its Dreamliner order penalty-free. Delta doesn't need more widebodies -- for now Since 2013, Delta Air Lines has ordered 60 widebodies from Airbus: 10 A330-300s, 25 A350-900s, and 25 A330-900neos. Eight of those planes have already been delivered, with the other 52 set to arrive over the next six years or so. Delta will receive its first A350 later this year. Image source: Airbus. These planes will mainly be used to replace Delta's remaining Boeing 747s and its older 767s. Delta will retire its last seven 747s in 2017. Among its 767s configured for international service, 24 were built between 1990 and 1996 and will be ripe for retirement between now and the early 2020s. However, the majority of Delta's internationally configured 767s -- 55 to be exact -- were built between 1997 and 2002. Given Delta's penchant for keeping older aircraft in service for as long as possible, these planes are likely to remain in its fleet until the mid-late 2020s. Thus, Delta already has more than enough Airbus widebodies on order to meet its replacement needs over the next six years or so. Meanwhile, rampant overcapacity on international routes limits the number of attractive long-haul expansion opportunities in the near term. Furthermore, facility constraints at Delta's new transpacific hub in Seattle will likely prevent the company from adding new international routes there until at least 2019. Indeed, Delta deferred part of its A350 order earlier this year in order to slow its growth rate over the next few years. Clearly, it has no need for additional widebody aircraft in the early 2020s, when the Dreamliners were scheduled to arrive. Delta could still buy Boeing's Dreamliner later Delta's existing orders with Airbus fully cover its widebody needs through at least 2022 or 2023. However, looking ahead to the mid-late 2020s, Delta will need to replace dozens of widebodies that it received in the late 1990s and early 2000s. That could create an opening for Delta to reorder Boeing's Dreamliner. Many of Delta's widebodies were built between 1998 and 2002. Image source: Delta Air Lines. Delta Air Lines executives have been explicit in recent years that they want to operate a mix of Boeing and Airbus planes in order to keep the pressure on both manufacturers to offer rock-bottom pricing. Thus, Airbus' recent run of widebody orders from Delta may reflect an attempt to balance out the fleet rather than a permanent decision to shift from Boeing to Airbus. Of course, it's possible that Delta will turn to the used aircraft market to fulfill some of its future widebody replacement needs. That said, the costs of refurbishing a widebody plane can be quite significant. Furthermore, by the mid-2020s, Dreamliner production costs -- particularly for the most popular variant, the 787-9 -- will have declined significantly from today's level. That will enable Boeing to offer lower prices. Ultimately, canceling its Dreamliner order was a no-brainer for Delta. It's not a big deal for Boeing either, as the 787-8 model is barely profitable. And Delta will still have an opportunity to reevaluate the Boeing 787 a few years down the road, when its newer 767s start to approach retirement age.

See related  Donald Trump's most outrageous quotes Melania Trump: 15 things you didn't know about Donald's wife How did Donald Trump win the presidency? He told a press conference yesterday that he was handing control of the vast Trump Organization to his two sons, Eric and Donald Jr. He said that the company would not make any new foreign deals during his presidency. The measures were immediately criticised by Walter Shaub, the director of the US Office of Government Ethics, who said they would leave the president vulnerable to "suspicions of corruption", says the New York Times. He added that Trump should sell his company and place the assets in a blind trust run by a truly independent trustee approved by the ethics office, not a family member.  "His sons are still running the businesses, and, of course, he knows what he owns." Shaub was appointed by Barack Obama, but also served during the presidency of his Republican predecessor George W Bush. The ethics office "sets standards for 2.7 million employees in the White House and more than 130 executive branch agencies". "No modern president has entered the White House with such a complicated array of holdings," says the Times. According to Shaub, "every modern president has taken the strong medicine of divestiture". It's a very rare step for the ethics chief to comment publicly on a President-elect's plans. The Guardian says that Trump's team did not informed Shaub's office of his plans. The paper quoted Shaub as saying that he was "especially troubled" by plans to put liquid assets in a portfolio approved by ethics officials. "No one has ever talked to us about the idea, and there's no legal mechanism to do that," he said. Sheri Dillon, a lawyer for the Trump Organization, told the Times that many of the alternatives the ethics lawyers had advocated, such as selling off Trump's business assets entirely or putting them in a blind trust, were not practical. Responding to calls to put his assets in a blind trust, she said that Trump "can't unknow he owns Trump Tower, and the press will make sure that any new developments at the Trump Organization are well publicised". "In addition, Dillon said, the price of a sale of assets would draw scrutiny, and… Trump would still be owed royalties". Donald Trump has to 'grow up', Joe Biden says 6 January Joe Biden has publicly declared that Donald Trump needs to "grow up" as he criticised the president-elect's attacks on the US intelligence community.   In a damning interview on PBS NewsHour, the outgoing vice president told the businessman: "Grow up, Donald. Grow up. Time to be an adult. You're president. You've got to do something. Show us what you have." He added it was "worrisome" that Trump, who takes power in two weeks, was still questioning the intelligence agencies' "overwhelming consensus" that Russia deliberately meddled in the US presidential election by hacking Democratic computers.  "For a president not to have confidence in, not to be prepared to listen to, the myriad intelligence agencies, from defence intelligence to the CIA, is absolutely mindless," he said. "The idea that you may know more than the intelligence community knows - it's like saying, 'I know more about physics than my professor. I didn't read the book, I just know I know more.'" Biden also criticised Trump's vow to repeal the Obamacare healthcare plan, saying the future president, while a "good man", lacked knowledge of the system. This is not the first time he has rounded on the Republican; the pair often clashed during the election campaign, particularly after a tape emerged of Trump talking about groping women, which the vice president said was "a textbook definition of sexual assault. Biden also told PBS that he will pursue non-political activities, including working with universities on domestic and foreign policy issues, after leaving office this month. He has said previously that he regrets not running for the White House "every day", although he has not ruled out what would be a third tilt at the presidency in 2020.  In one of his last acts as vice president, Biden will today preside over a joint session of Congress to formally confirm Trump's presidency, the Daily Telegraph reports. Donald Trump: Why he is siding with Julian Assange against US intelligence community  5 January Donald Trump has set himself on a collision course with US intelligence services after publicly criticising senior officials and siding against them with WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange. The president-elect mocked the US intelligence agencies due to brief him on alleged Russian hacking of US political groups in a tweet on Wednesday. The "Intelligence" briefing on so-called "Russian hacking" was delayed until Friday, perhaps more time needed to build a case. Very strange! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 4, 2017 "It was his latest attack on a key body he will rely on as commander in chief," says CNN, and again put him at odds with the agencies' unanimous conclusion that Russia hacked Democratic groups and individuals to interfere in the US presidential election. Despite being elected in November, Trump is yet to meet the heads of US intelligence agencies, although he has repeatedly questioned their assessment of Russian cyber activity. In another sign of increasing tension between the intelligence community and the president-elect, Trump also tweeted his support for Assange after he told Fox News that Moscow was not the source for WikiLeaks's mass leak of emails from the Democrats. Both the FBI and CIA say the leaked information was intended to sway the presidential election in Trump's favour. However, Assange claimed a 14-year-old boy could have carried out one of the hacks and accused the Obama administration of attempting to "delegitimise" a Trump presidency by falsely tying Russia to the attack. Trump's support represents an astonishing change in fortunes for the Australian hacker, who was publically vilified by conservatives, including Fox News, when he leaked US military secrets and published classified diplomatic cables in 2010. However, while Trump appears to be on his side, Assange has continued to face criticism from other Republicans. House Speaker Paul Ryan called him a "a sycophant for Russia", later adding: "He leaks, he steals data and he compromises national security."  Senator Mark Warner, vice president of the US intelligence committee, also said the president-elect should have more "respect" for intelligence professionals. Trump has previously criticised the spy agencies for the faulty intelligence about Iraq's supposed possession of weapons of mass destruction before the US invasion in 2003. However, "to publicly embarrass some of the most senior intelligence officials in the country and question their motives is unprecedented for a president-elect or incumbent president", says The Independent. Donald Trump dismisses North Korean missile tests in tweet 3 January Donald Trump has shot down North Korea's claim that it is close to testing long-range missiles capable of targeting the United States. North Korean leader Kim Jong-un made the claim in his New Year message, saying the country was almost ready to test intercontinental ballistic missiles that could carry nuclear warheads. However, the US president-elect derided the suggesting, tweeting simply: "It won't happen!" North Korea just stated that it is in the final stages of developing a nuclear weapon capable of reaching parts of the U.S. It won't happen! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 2, 2017 Trump also took aim at China over the issue, writing: "China has been taking out massive amounts of money & wealth from the U.S. in totally one-sided trade, but won't help with North Korea. Nice!" See related  Donald Trump's most outrageous quotes Melania Trump: 15 things you didn't know about Donald's wife How did Donald Trump win the presidency? It is Trump's first comment on North Korea's nuclear plans since the US presidential election in November. Prior to that, he had said he might be prepared to have a burger with Kim. South Korea said Trump's message showed he understood the seriousness of the situation and could be interpreted as a "clear warning" to Pyongyang.    "President-elect Trump and US officials are clearly aware of the gravity and urgency of the North Korean nuclear threat," ministry spokesman Cho June-hyuck told a briefing, reports Reuters. "There are no ifs or buts in Mr Trump's tweet," the BBC says, adding that the message could mean the president-elect believes North Korea will not be able to finalise the technology or that he thinks the two countries could reach an agreement for it to terminate its nuclear programme. It could also imply Trump is considering military action, although experts, who calculate Pyongyang is less than five years from conducting successful tests, believe that would be ineffectual. Methods such as "bunker-busting" bombs would be unlikely to halt the programme, while cyber warfare or the assassination of top scientists would also be difficult. The US has dismissed North Korea's attempts to hold talks over the years, saying it must disarm first.

(Andy Bronson / The Herald) Aerospace blog Mukilteo aerospace supplier has a social-service mission, too Dan Catchpole Tue Jan 3rd, 2017 7:45am BusinessNews You must sign in or register to continue reading content. MUKILTEO — Walk through Orion Industries’ Mukilteo plant and you’ll see airplane innards — wire bundles, part of a light fixture for front-landing gear, air vents. They are some of the roughly 2 million parts its manufacturing division provides to Boeing and other aerospace companies. Unlike its competitors, Orion Industries is not simply serving its bottom line. It is a nonprofit that combines commercial success with a social mission. The Auburn-based company provides counseling and job training for people who have challenges to landing a job on their own, challenges such as neurological, developmental or psychological disabilities. Trainees may have had trouble in the job market, but Orion is not about hand-holding or creating busy work, said Tom Brosius, its vice president and general manager. “To bring in a program participant, they have to be creating value pretty quickly” on balance. Despite its social mission, Orion has to competitively bid against local and international companies for work. Its products are on every Boeing commercial and military airplane. It also provides parts to other airplane makers — including Bombardier, Airbus and Gulfstream — and major aerospace suppliers such as Triumph, Spirit Aerospace and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries. Orion was named a Boeing Supplier of the Year in 2011 and 2015. “The main thing is to get parts out on time” and to spec, said Rodney Goodwin, a machinist in the Mukilteo plant. “We do quality work.” Sometimes that means a rush job turning out a spare part for an aircraft stranded on the ground. It has to be done quickly and properly. The company has a simple philosophy when assessing newcomers for training. “Everybody’s good at something. Most people aren’t good at everything,” Brosius said. Some people learn machine tooling and get manufacturing jobs. Others learn customer service and find work at a restaurant. Some find jobs at Orion. In 2015, 56 percent of participants went into manufacturing and production, 15 percent into customer service and 29 percent into other industries — including one carpenter, a bus driver and an IT consultant. The company has a call center in Auburn that has about 70 employees, including 12 people from Orion’s training program. The company handles calls for major clients, such as Microsoft and the state Department of Fish and Wildlife. “If you need a fishing license at 3 a.m., you’ll talk to someone at Orion,” Brosius said. Orion has about 400 employees, and serves more than 300 people a year. It acquired the Mukilteo plant in September when it merged with Diversified Industrial Services, a nonprofit with a similar mission. Orion Industries was founded in 1957 by several south King County families who had relatives with disabilities that limited their options. They started making wooden toys in a church basement, Brosius said. “A lot of the families were Boeing families,” and within two years, Orion was making parts for the 707, Boeing’s first jetliner, he said. Most participants now are referred to Orion by two state agencies: the Division of Vocational Rehabilitation and the Developmental Disabilities Administration. Both are under the Department of Social and Health Services. They are matched with training programs that best fit their strengths and weaknesses. They are assigned mentors, who provide on-the-job training. They also receive counseling and other support along the way and after landing a job. The need to have someone be a mentor and a worker can make it hard to fill openings, especially for high-skill jobs. “We’re asking a machinist to do their work and train somebody. It’s a pretty unusual combination of skills,” Brosius said. But “it’s an opportunity you can’t find anywhere else” in the region. That is one reason Orion has such low turnover — about 8 percent a year, he said. The company is in the process of expanding its aerospace manufacturing training to Mukilteo. Currently, it is only in Auburn. Teaching technical skills is relatively straightforward. Teaching how to show up on time and with the right attitude is trickier. Brosius said. “It’s always the soft skills that require the most work.” Building confidence and self-esteem are critical steps, as well. “Self-esteem is number one. Pretty much everyone who walks in the door has gotten here through bad choices or bad luck. It hasn’t been a good ride,” he said. Mentors know that and make sure to give students opportunities to succeed. “We’re going to work with them until they get it right,” he said. “There are no free rides.” Dan Catchpole: 425-339-3454; dcatchpole@heraldnet.com.

The British Ministry of Defense claimed in July that it had "confirmed the deal to purchase nine P-8A Poseidon Maritime Patrol Aircraft" from Boeing. However, The Daily Mirror reported Sunday that the deal with the outgoing administration of President Barack Obama was far from complete and in fact no orders were made before the New Year. The problem is that the deal is a "foreign military sale," meaning that it requires Washington's approval before Boeing could make the delivery. This leaves the contract "at the mercy" of Trump, Obama's successor, the report added. "Why are we not buying these planes directly from Boeing and instead using a foreign military sale?" said Lib Dem defense spokeswoman Baroness Judith Jolly. "This puts us at the mercy of the Americans and soon-to-be President Trump." Back in July, the government of then-UK prime minister David Cameron said it had inked new multi-billion pound contracts with Boeing. As part of the deal, Boeing had to provide the Royal Air Force with nine P-8A Poseidon spy aircraft, complete with a £100 million ($129 million) maintenance facility at the RAF Lossiemouth base in Moray. UK military sources told the daily earlier that the deal "for the 8th US Production Lot, which will include the UK's initial aircraft, will be placed early next year." Based on Boeing's best-selling 737 aircraft, the P-8 or Poseidon is capable of launching torpedoes, depth charges, SLAM-ER missiles, Harpoon anti-ship missiles and other weapons. It can also track submarines and alert the UK Navy's vessels of approaching threats. The UK has recently made another "foreign military sale" with the US, under which London would receive an undisclosed number of nuclear-capable Tomahawk cruise missiles from the US Navy.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Tuesday, 3 January 2017 | MYT 9:00 AM How Seattle became ‘Cloud City’: Amazon and Microsoft are leading a tech revolution by matt day On the ball: Corey Sanders of Microsoft leads a cloud-computing team working with Boeing. "If you're not building (tools) that are keeping up with your customers on a daily or weekly basis, you're falling behind," he says. — Seattle Times/TNS SEATTLE: In a Seattle-area conference room earlier this year, Washington state's two largest employers started sketching out the future.  In a daylong series of meetings at Microsoft's campus, engineers from the software company knocked heads and keyboards with their counterparts at Boeing. The goal: tapping in to Microsoft's Azure, the software maker's network of on-demand computing power, to build a new generation of software.  Boeing for years has made tools, from paper navigational aids to maintenance software, that help its aerospace customers fly and take care of their planes. An engineer with a record book and a manual knows roughly when to replace a part. But an engineer equipped with software that can help make sense of decades of maintenance data could do a more precise job, the thinking goes, improving aircraft maintenance and fuel consumption. Boeing is hoping to build web-based variants of its aviation analytics tools on Microsoft's Azure.  "If you're not building (tools) that are keeping up with your customers on a daily or weekly basis, you're falling behind," said Corey Sanders, a Microsoft manager who leads a cloud-computing team working with Boeing. "Because your competitors are."  Cloud computing, or tapping in to rented computer power and data storage over the internet, has existed for more than a decade. Most people know the cloud as the unseen servers that store the emails in their Gmail account or back up their iPhone photos.  But enabled by increasingly sophisticated technologies – and billions of dollars' worth of factory-sized server farms being built around the world – cloud computing is changing from a consumer phenomenon to one that's reshaping big business. Thanks to the growth of Amazon.com, Microsoft and a roster of Silicon Valley transplants, it's also reshaping Seattle.  Technologists compare the shift now under way to the advent of electrical utilities a century ago that sparked rapid advances in fields from agriculture to medicine and entertainment. Electricity rapidly changed from an expensive good available only to those with the wherewithal to generate it themselves to a ubiquitous commodity only noticed when it goes down.  "In general, there is someone who can deliver you electricity more reliably and less expensively than you can generate it yourself," said Ed Lazowska, a University of Washington computer scientist. "What's happening now is most of us are increasingly relying on utilities, be it Amazon, or Microsoft or Google, to give us the computing we need."  In other words, the power of the technology at your fingertips no longer depends on how powerful of a PC you bought for your den or the number of servers blinking in the backroom where you work.  All you need is a credit card, which can give you access to the power and technology that enables everything from your corporate email account to a supercomputer.  Competing for cash  Sales of Internet-accessed software and technology services are expected to total about US$118bil (RM529.34bil) this year, researcher Gartner estimates.  That sum represents an industry in its infancy. Gartner estimates that business will direct more than $1 trillion of cash toward cloud computing between now and 2020.  The technology industry is fiercely competing for that cash, a race pitting traditional business computing giants like IBM and Oracle against relative newcomers Salesforce.com and Dropbox, and hundreds of startups.  Seattle is at the forefront of this revolution, largely thanks to Amazon.com.  Google, Microsoft and Yahoo all built their own search engines, email platforms and other global web services that relied on massive datacentres, but it was Amazon that first started renting that kind of infrastructure to other businesses.  In 2006 the company launched Amazon Web Services, or AWS, which at first amounted to a big, web-accessed hard drive where other businesses could store their data. A few months later the company added a service where businesses could also rent the processing power available on Amazon-maintained servers.  At the time, the world of business technology was structured like this: corporate information-technology departments bought servers and the expensive software that made them tick and installed on top of that the specific applications that the business needed to run, be it word-processing tools, accounting databases or other software.  Office workers accessed the whole pile of technology from a personal computer.  Amazon's alternative was simple: Don't bother with most of that; rent it from us instead. Employees, who can still access the whole system via the web or their PC, won't notice.  That premise was a hit among technology startups, an alternative to shelling out tens of thousands of dollars for servers and software, and spending days or weeks setting it up.  Caught flat-footed  AWS built dozens of services, replicating in cyberspace the functions of all sorts of out-of-the-box software.  Much of the rest of the industry, living well off the high margins they were used to reaping from business software sales, was caught flat-footed.  A watershed moment arrived in 2013 when the Central Intelligence Agency awarded a large datacentre contract to Amazon over IBM, a company with decades of experience providing technology services to giant customers. The vote of confidence from the spy agency helped ease business-technology buyers' worry about the reliability and security of Amazon, a company better known as an online bookstore than a technology provider.  In the years since, interest in cloud services has spread to increasingly large and sophisticated businesses and government institutions. When they go looking for data storage, processing power and other infrastructure services, many choose Amazon.  Amazon's annual shareholders meeting in May was a triumphant affair. The company's stock was near a record high, and investors cheered the transformation of an online bookseller to a retail juggernaut with a massive technology arm.  AWS took in more than US$11bil (RM49.34bil) in sales over the most recently reported 12 months, accounting for 71% of the company's operating income before taxes.  Jeff Bezos, Amazon's chief executive, said he was surprised by how long it took big technology-industry incumbents to match AWS' capabilities after the service was hatched.  "We got a seven-year runway," Bezos said. "That's almost unheard of. For years, we were kind of left alone."  Microsoft jumps in  When a big competitor did come calling, it was a familiar name.  After a decade of flubs in consumer technology, and a few false-starts in cloud computing, Microsoft has gone all-in on the cloud, investing billions of dollars in datacentres from Australia to Germany and Quincy, Washington.  While it built that infrastructure, Microsoft also changed its approach, reorienting a company that built its business around massive software releases delivered every few years to one that pushed out new products every week – and suddenly had to listen to customers at the same time.  Scott Guthrie, the Microsoft executive vice president who oversees the company's Cloud and Enterprise unit, says the payoff has started to arrive in the past couple of years.  "There's almost no cloud (buying) conversation anywhere that we're not part of," he said in an interview.  This year, those conversations have made customers out of companies like BMW, General Electric and Boeing.  "They came from so far behind, and they came out of the gate roaring," said Brent Frei, an executive with Smartsheet, a software company that partners with both Amazon and Microsoft. "I didn't know you could turn a big company around that much."  ___ Cloud Computing Broadly defined, cloud computing comes in three categories: Infrastructure as a service: Nuts and bolts of computing, rented virtual machines, storage space or network time, usually on a pay-for-what-you-use basis. This realm is dominated by Amazon.com. Platform as a service: A developer's sandbox, including ready-made databases or tools to create websites. Software as a service: Ready-made tools accessed over the Web. This is the bucket most consumers would recognise – think Facebook or Gmail. In the corporate world, think Microsoft's Office 365, Salesforce.com's sales tracking tools or Concur's expense-management software. — The Seattle Times/Tribune News Service You May Be Interested Boosting women's libido Glass discards now included in waste separation law Better rates via online forex services Paying high interest rates for personal loans Purple should be your favourite CNY colour Chinese herb Dang Shen helps to boost strength Others Also Read Kohli, Jadhav hundreds help India eclipse England's 350 Goodies for readers Do we really need to fear China money? advertisement Latest News Create your own website Two thumbs-up for Oculus Touch Sci-fi tech set for 2017 QLED vs OLED PCs on the rise Most Viewed in Tech QLED vs OLED PCs on the rise Could your gadgets send you to jail?

REUTERS/Jim Young Enlarge Caption  Email More A A SEATTLE: Boeing Co said on Wednesday it had booked firm orders for 80 of its 737 MAX 8 aircraft, valued at US$8.8 billion at list prices, upping its 2016 tally but leaving it short of its goal. The orders mean the world's biggest plane maker clinched at least 536 net jetliner sales last year compared with its target of selling as many commercial jets as it delivers, a total it puts between 745 and 750. Through November, Boeing had delivered 681 planes. Boeing's order tally could climb again on Friday, as the company posts its final update for 2016. Investors watch orders closely as a way to gauge future production and revenue, since Boeing earns the bulk of its money when aircraft are delivered. The company has orders equivalent to about seven years of production, but the majority are single-aisle 737 planes, and sales of its more expensive widebodies like the 777 remain sluggish. Boeing Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg affirmed the company's overall order target in July. In December, he said Boeing would cut 777 output by 40 percent this year due to slow sales of widebody planes. The orders announced Wednesday include 75 Boeing 737 MAX 8s for General Electric Co Capital Aviation Services (GECAS), valued at US$8.25 billion at list prices. GE supplies engines for the 737 MAX through CFM International, a joint venture with Safran SA of France. The latest sale means GECAS now has 170 Boeing 737 MAXs on order, more than any other leasing company, Boeing said. The remaining orders, valued at US$550 million, came from Travel Service, the largest airline company in the Czech Republic, which operates as SmartWings, Boeing said. Through December 20, Boeing booked 470 net orders in 2016. Since then, it has announced orders for four 737-800s by Jet2.com. On Dec. 27, Delta Air Lines said it was cancelling an order for 18 Boeing 787 Dreamliners. Northwest Airlines placed the order before it merged with Delta. Tallying the changes, Boeing's book-to-bill ratio is 0.79, below the target of 1.0. A Boeing spokesman declined to comment, citing a quiet period before fourth-quarter earnings on Jan. 25. Boeing has received over 3,400 orders for the 737 MAX. The first 737 MAX is expected to be delivered in the first half of 2017. Boeing's shares were up about 1 percent at US$158.46. Up to Tuesday's close, the stock had risen 11.7 percent in the past 12 months, compared with a 12.2 percent rise in the S&P 500 index .

Featured Story U2 tickets selling for whopping 900 euros each DUBLIN, Ireland - With epic rock band, U2 set to perform at a concert in Croke Park in July this year - a flurry of activity has been witnessed around ticket sales already.  Tickets are set to go on sale officially from tomorrow - however, a day before the official sales begin, tickets to watch the band perform live are already being sold and for nothing less than a whopping 900 euros each.  According to reports, fans that subscribed to the band’s official website were granted access to a pre-sale ticket portal last week and industry sources revealed that diehard fans with access to these tickets have chosen to sell them for a profit.  A set of tickets are said to have become available on official and black market websites since last week.  Tickets available currently on websites like Seatwave and Viagogo are being sold at prices higher than face value.  Officially, tickets for the Lower Davin Stand and pitch area of Croke Park have been priced at 76 euros, along with an extra charge of 3.30 euros for agent fees. Meanwhile, those in other parts of the Cusack and Hogan stands carry a value between 110 euros to 186 euros. But on these websites, the prices have been jacked up.   As of Sunday night, Seatwave, that is run by Ticketmaster, had advertised for 650 tickets that were available for sale.  Reports pointed ut that a pair of tickets was sold at 2,070 euros over the weekend and was for the standing section. It included extra charges and was priced at 13 times above face value.  A spokesperson for Ticketmaster defended the sale in a statement that said that Seatwave prices were set by the person selling the tickets and not the company. The spokesperson said, “The thing about Seatwave is that it is a safe and secure market so tickets would be genuine. The ticket prices are set by the seller, which in this instance is not Ticketmaster, but that price may not necessarily be secured by the seller. Ticketmaster is just facilitating the sale."

The sale should boost Boeing’s 2016 net order tally above 600 airplanes. (Mike Siegel/The Seattle Times) The sale of 75 jets to GE Capital Aviation Services should boost Boeing’s 2016 net order tally above 600 airplanes. Share story By Dominic Gates Seattle Times aerospace reporter Boeing booked a big 737 MAX order worth an estimated $3.8 billion from the aircraft leasing arm of GE during the holiday break. GE Capital Aviation Services (GECAS) ordered 75 MAX 8 aircraft. GECAS’s support for the MAX is unsurprising because GE is the exclusive engine supplier for the airplane with its new LEAP engine. The sale should boost Boeing’s 2016 net order tally above 600 airplanes. Boeing has projected about 740 deliveries for the year. With the typical year-end rush of sales, the final order tally may be close to that delivery figure. Also over the break, Czech airline Travel Service said it signed a deal to buy five more 737 MAXs, adding to a previous order for 25 of the jets.

Boeing will announce its final 2016 sales and delivery figures Friday. At list prices, the GECAS deal is valued at $8.25 billion, but such orders typically get large discounts. According to market pricing data from aircraft valuation firm Avitas, the discount is at least 54 percent.

 Boeing just got an $8.3 billion order for its fastest selling jet of all time Benjamin Zhang Jan. 4, 2017, 1:29 PM 12,502 facebook linkedin twitter email print Boeing 737 MAX in GECAS livery.Boeing On Wednesday, Boeing announced that GE Capital Aviation Services (GECAS) has placed an order for 75 737-MAX 8 airliners. With a list price of $110 million per aircraft, the deal could be worth as much as $8.25 billion. Large orders of this type commonly include significant bulk discounts. As a result, it is likely the GECAS order is worth less than list value. The deal, which was completed in December, pushed the total number of 737MAX airliners on order from GECAS up to 170 planes. GECAS is the Irish-American commercial aircraft financing and leasing arm of General Electric. The company currently owns and services a fleet of 1,950 aircraft and holds loans on another 400 or so planes. "We appreciate the confidence GECAS has in the 737 MAX, and look forward to seeing the airplanes placed with carriers all over the world," Brad McMullen, Boeing Commercial Airplanes' vice president for North America and Leasing Sales, said in a statement. To date, the airplane maker has booked 3,419 orders for the 737MAX. According to Boeing, this make it the fastest selling plane in company history. "Our customers want the latest technology and fuel efficiency, and the CFM International LEAP-1B engines on these aircraft deliver outstanding productivity and reliability in the single-aisle market," GECAS president and CEO Alec Burger said in a statement. The LEAP 1-B engines that will power the 737MAX are made by CFM International — a 50/50 joint venture between GE and SAFRAN Aircraft Engines of France.

GM and Ford each rose 5 percent. Advertisement Retailers are rising as the market builds on its gains from the day before. Gap also gained 5 percent. Bond prices haven’t moved much. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note held steady at 2.45 percent. AUTO SALES US auto sales near record highs in 2016 DETROIT (AP) — Demand may be slowing, but U.S. consumers still bought a whole lot of cars and trucks in 2016. U.S. sales of new vehicles could hit a new high in 2016. Consulting firm LMC Automotive and car-buying site Edmunds.com both predict sales will squeak past the record set in 2015 and reach 17.5 million in 2016. Nissan says its U.S. sales rose 5 percent in 2016 to more than 1.5 million, a company record. Ford’s sales were up less than 1 percent to more than 2.6 million. Fiat Chrysler’s sales were flat at 2.2 million. General Motors said its year-over-year sales were down 1.3 percent to just over 3 million cars and trucks. That was partly because the company cut back on low-profit sales to rental-car firms. Toyota’s full-year sales fell 2 percent to 2.4 million. Volkswagen brands sales dropped 8 percent to 322,948, hurt by the company’s diesel mileage cheating scandal. Ford’s F-Series pickup remained the best-selling vehicle in America in 2016, with 820,799 trucks sold. That’s the equivalent of 93 trucks sold every hour. TRUMP-SEC Trump picks Wall Street lawyer Clayton for SEC WASHINGTON (AP) — President-elect Donald Trump wants Wall Street lawyer Jay Clayton to be chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Trump says in a statement that Clayton is “a highly talented expert on many aspects of financial and regulatory law.” Trump says his nominee will work to ensure that financial institutions “can thrive and create jobs while playing by the rules at the same time.” The Senate must OK the nomination of Clayton, a partner at Sullivan & Cromwell LLP. Clayton is the latest Trump pick with deep ties to Wall Street — having represented Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Barclays Capital Inc. Trump says he wants to undo many regulations that he says have “stifled investment” in Americans businesses. Clayton says he’ll “carefully monitor” the financial sector and set policies that encourages companies to create jobs. EXXON-TILLERSON-SEVERANCE Tillerson and Exxon part ways; $180M retirement package NEW YORK (AP) — Rex Tillerson, the nominee of President-elect Donald Trump for secretary of state, is severing ties with Exxon Mobil through a $180 million retirement package ahead of his Senate confirmation hearing. Tillerson was expected to step down as CEO of Exxon Mobil Corp. in March when he turned 65, the company’s mandatory retirement age. Exxon said in a regulatory filing Wednesday that Tillerson has agreed to give up approximately 2 million unvested shares. In exchange, the company has agreed to make a cash payment equal to the value of those shares into a trust. Tillerson, who worked for Exxon for more than 40 years, is giving up about $7 million in compensation and benefits that he would have received if he had he stayed until March. CONGRESS-HEALTH OVERHAUL Obama, Pence to Capitol as health care overhaul fight begins WASHINGTON (AP) — Vice President-elect Mike Pence says Donald Trump’s “first order of business” as president will be to repeal President Barack Obama’s health care law and replace it. But Pence says Republicans must avoid hurting consumers as they do that. In a visit to Capitol Hill, Pence said Trump’s team is already working with GOP congressional leaders on plans to undo Obama’s law with both legislation and executive action the president and federal agencies would be able to take. Rep. Dave Brat, R-Va., said Pence told them the goal was to get legislation dismantling the health care law to Trump for his signature by Feb. 20. Obama also made a visit to the Capitol to meet with congressional Democrats on how to combat the Republican drive to dismantle the health care overhaul. He urged Democratic lawmakers to “Keep up the fight” and advised them to remind voters of how the law has helped them. CONGRESS-REGULATIONS House GOP to start regulation repeals Jan. 30 WASHINGTON (AP) — House Republicans say they will begin introducing legislation on Jan. 30 to repeal a series of Obama administration regulations, with the early focus on environmental rules. Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy says GOP leaders haven’t yet picked which agency regulation Congress will seek to overturn first. He said he expects swift action on invalidating a rule designed to reduce methane emissions and another designed to reduce the environmental impact of coal mining on the nation’s streams. McCarthy says the two rules “limit our energy production.” Republicans will also seek to repeal regulations implementing an education reform bill that some state officials have complained erodes local decision-making. Before the House goes after specific agency rules, McCarthy says it will tackle the regulatory process itself to give Congress more control. OIL PIPELINE-FINE North Dakota challenges pipeline developer argument vs. fine BISMARCK, N.D. (AP) — Staffers with the North Dakota Public Service Commission say there’s no doubt the developer of the four-state, $3.8 billion Dakota Access oil pipeline violated rules regarding reporting Native American artifacts. Via attorney John Schuh, the PSC staffers urge the commission to move forward with a fine of at least $15,000 for Dallas-based Energy Transfer Partners. In October, the company diverted construction around Native American artifacts without running the plan by the commission, which oversees pipelines. ETP has said that it shouldn’t be fined because state law says there needs to be a willful violation. Schuh said in his Dec. 15 response that a fine should be imposed regardless of intent. The PSC will decide whether to dismiss the case or schedule a hearing. CZECH-BOEING Czech airline to buy 5 more Boeing 737 MAX jets PRAGUE (AP) — Czech airline Travel Service says it has signed a deal to buy five more new Boeing 737 MAX jets. Spokeswoman Vladimira Dufkova said Wednesday the contract was signed on Dec. 23 and brings to 30 the total number of such Boeing aircraft that Travel Service has recently agreed to buy. The jets will be delivered between 2018 and 2023. Financial details were not disclosed. The airline, which operates regular flights under the name SmartWings as well as charter flights, is the biggest in the Czech Republic. It currently uses 37 jets, of which 32 are various types of Boeing 737s. The CEFC China Energy Company has a minority stake in the airline. EUROPE-ECONOMY Eurozone inflation spikes to highest in over 3 years BRUSSELS (AP) — Official figures show that inflation across the 19-country eurozone spiked in December to its highest rate in more than three years, largely on the back of rising energy costs. Eurostat, the European Union’s statistics agency, says Wednesday that the annual inflation rate rose to 1.1 percent in December from November’s 0.6 percent. December’s rate is the highest since Sept. 2013, when inflation also stood at 1.1 percent. The figures are likely to cheer policymakers at the European Central Bank who have sought to get inflation toward the target of just below 2 percent. Still, there may be some concern that, when excluding energy costs, inflation remains muted. The core rate, which strips out volatile items like energy and food, rose to only 0.9 percent from the previous month’s 0.8 percent. INSURANCE-DISASTER LOSSES Insurer: 2016 saw highest natural disaster losses in 4 years BERLIN (AP) — A leading insurer says that last year saw the highest costs from natural disasters since 2012, with a pair of earthquakes in Japan in April accounting for the heaviest losses. Munich Re said in an annual survey Wednesday that losses from natural disasters totaled $175 billion last year, some $50 billion of which was covered by insurance. The earthquakes on Japan’s southern Kyushu island caused $31 billion worth of damage, with $6 billion of the costs covered by insurance. Floods in China in June and July caused $20 billion in costs, only $300 million of which was insured. Hurricane Matthew, which hit the Caribbean and the eastern United States in August, incurred losses totaling $10.2 billion, of which $3.8 billion was covered by insurance. GADGET SHOW Research firm sees shipments of PCs, tablets, phones and other gadgets flat in 2017 LAS VEGAS (AP) — Research firm Gartner says it expects worldwide shipments of PCs, tablets, phones and other gadgets to remain unchanged in 2017. Gartner says it expects 2.3 billion such devices to ship this year, the same as in 2016. This finding comes as gadget makers unveil all sorts of new products at the CES tech show in Las Vegas this week. Looking ahead, Gartner says the embattled PC market should return to growth in 2018, thanks to a natural cycle of upgrades. That’s mostly driven by an increase in premium “ultramobiles” — including ultra-slim Windows 10 devices and Apple’s MacBook Air. Smartphones are expected to grow just slightly; much of the growth is in emerging Asia and Pacific markets. In a report Wednesday, Gartner research director Ranjit Atwal says consumers have fewer reasons to upgrade or to buy traditional devices. Rather, he says, “they are seeking fresher experiences and applications in emerging categories such as head mounted displays, virtual personal assistant speakers and wearables.” GADGET SHOW-TVS High-end LG TVs include ultra-slim set LAS VEGAS (AP) — New television sets from LG will include an ultra-slim model that’s less than 4 millimeters (0.15 inch) thick. The company is achieving this by moving many of the bulky components — such as graphic cards — into a separate box connected to the screen with just a cord. The speakers are also separated; the TV has two round, retractable speakers on top. The new TV will also have better audio, using Dolby Atmos technology, along with high-end OLED screen technology. OLED — which stands for organic light-emitting diode — can produce better pictures because each pixel produces light individually. Traditional TVs are backlit and use filters to block out light — but not well enough to produce pure black. OLED is rare in TVs and is currently found mostly in smartphones. LG will have non-OLED models, too, and promises new technology to make colors more vibrant. LG also says an LG Technicolor mode will be added to TVs in 2017 to add to color accuracy. Samsung, LG, Sony and others are unveiling new offerings at CES that highlight higher-resolution pictures, thinner displays and brighter colors. The moves come as high-definition and 4K TVs are becoming cheaper and more mainstream, so top TV makers are competing for the higher end of the market. LG says it will release prices in February and start selling them in March. GADGET SHOW-COMCAST Comcast wants to tackle bad home internet LAS VEGAS (AP) — Comcast is hoping to make Wi-Fi in the home faster through an updated router — the machine that serves as data traffic cops for Wi-Fi networks. Although home internet speeds have gotten faster, laptops and phones on Wi-Fi might still feel sluggish because older routers can’t transmit data as fast. Comcast’s updated router costs $10 a month and comes with a modem. It’s the same price as before. Customers can still buy their own equipment and save money over time. Comcast is also offering extenders to help Wi-Fi work all over a house, though the company wouldn’t say what it might charge. Eero, Starry, Google and Luma are among the companies that have fancy new router systems, but they start at more than $100 and run as much as $500. Fewer than 5 million Comcast customers, mostly those on the most expensive internet packages, will get the new high-powered router this year. The company says it could take years to reach the bulk of its more than 24 million customers. Another 10 million customers with the company’s existing routers will get a software update by March to make it easier to set up parental controls and install “smart” thermostats and other internet-connected appliances. These features also come with the new routers.

REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon/Files By Alwyn Scott | SEATTLE SEATTLE Boeing Co (BA.N) said on Wednesday it had booked firm orders for 80 of its 737 MAX 8 aircraft, valued at $8.8 billion at list prices, upping its 2016 tally but leaving it short of its goal. The orders mean the world's biggest plane maker clinched at least 536 net jetliner sales last year compared with its target of selling as many commercial jets as it delivers, a total it puts between 745 and 750. Through November, Boeing had delivered 681 planes. Boeing's order tally could climb again on Friday, as the company posts its final update for 2016. Investors watch orders closely as a way to gauge future production and revenue, since Boeing earns the bulk of its money when aircraft are delivered. The company has orders equivalent to about seven years of production, but the majority are single-aisle 737 planes, and sales of its more expensive widebodies like the 777 remain sluggish. Boeing Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg affirmed the company's overall order target in July. In December, he said Boeing would cut 777 output by 40 percent this year due to slow sales of widebody planes. The orders announced Wednesday include 75 Boeing 737 MAX 8s for General Electric Co (GE.N) Capital Aviation Services (GECAS), valued at $8.25 billion at list prices. GE supplies engines for the 737 MAX through CFM International, a joint venture with Safran SA (SAF.PA) of France. The latest sale means GECAS now has 170 Boeing 737 MAXs on order, more than any other leasing company, Boeing said. The remaining orders, valued at $550 million, came from Travel Service, the largest airline company in the Czech Republic, which operates as SmartWings, Boeing said. Through December 20, Boeing booked 470 net orders in 2016. Since then, it has announced orders for four 737-800s by Jet2.com. On Dec. 27, Delta Air Lines (DAL.N) said it was cancelling an order for 18 Boeing 787 Dreamliners. Northwest Airlines placed the order before it merged with Delta. Tallying the changes, Boeing's book-to-bill ratio is 0.79, below the target of 1.0. A Boeing spokesman declined to comment, citing a quiet period before fourth-quarter earnings on Jan. 25. Boeing has received over 3,400 orders for the 737 MAX. The first 737 MAX is expected to be delivered in the first half of 2017. Boeing's shares were up about 1 percent at $158.46. Up to Tuesday's close, the stock had risen 11.7 percent in the past 12 months, compared with a 12.2 percent rise in the S&P 500 index .SPX.

Which UK airports does Norwegian airways operate from, how much are flights to New York and why are they so cheap? The budget airline has announced ridiculously cheap fares to the US, so what's the catch? By Laura Burnip 4th January 2017, 3:18 pm Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window) Comments START spreading the news – you will soon be able to fly from the UK to New York for just £56. The cheap flights – the lowest transatlantic fare around – have been announced by budget airline Norwegian. So where do these planes go from, and is it really as good a deal as it sounds? Getty Images 3 The budget airline is offering flights to the Big Apple for an incredible £56 – so what’s the catch? Why is Norwegian Airways offering really cheap tickets from Britain to New York? The airline has invested in fuel efficient Boeing 737Max planes, which allow it to go further with cheaper fuel costs. Chief executive of the Oslo-based airline Bjorn Kjos told the Telegraph: “We have a totally different set up to other airlines. “The Boeing 737MAX has a very modern engine, which means it can go for a longer distance. “Our planes are very, very fuel efficient.” The airline launched its transatlantic flights in 2014, and currently flies twice a day from Gatwick to New York starting from £125 each way. It also offers services to Florida, San Francisco, Los Angeles and Las Vegas. The £56 tickets will be the cheapest on the market when they launch in the summer. Norwegian Air releases video to persuade us to fly to New York Getty Images 3 The airline says its new fuel-efficient planes will allow it to slash prices Where do Norwegian's flights to New York go from and what's the catch? Well, first of all, the planes are only going to be flying from Edinburgh - even though the airline has a base at Gatwick. And secondly, they won't be flying into JFK airport in Queens. One of the ways Norwegian has slashed its prices is to fly to out-of-town airports in New York state. “That means we don’t pay as much and can charge cheaper fares," says Mr Kjos. The actual destination hasn't been announced yet but Norwegian currently flies to Newark Liberty International Airport from the UK - about a half hour drive from Manhattan. And like most budget airlines, there are a few extra costs. According to Norwegian's website, seat reservations cost £25 per person each way, meals cost £28 each and checked baggage is £40 each way. So with food, a suitcase and somewhere to sit on the plane, you're looking at £149 each way - which is still pretty cheap. Getty Images 3 The super-cheap flights will only be going from Edinburgh rather than Norwegian's base at Gatwick Will Norwegian start flying to New York from anywhere else in the UK? At the moment, the super-cheap fares are only on offer from Edinburgh. But the airline has hinted that it could expand. Mr Kjos has said its long-haul flights are usually 95% full, and it is planning to increase the frequency of its flights from Gatwick to the US by 55%. "Passengers have shown that is demand there," Mr Kjos told the Telegraph. Norwegian is also reported to be looking to operate from Irish airports Shannon and Cork.

Thousands of commercial aircraft fly passengers and goods to tens of thousands of destinations throughout the world every day. For the commercial aircraft carrying passengers and cargo in very harsh environments, inspection and maintenance for safe operation are crucial (see videos below). Aviation maintenance is also a lucrative sector. In the United Kingdom the aviation maintenance, repair, overhaul and logistics sector today generates revenues in excess of £15 billion (Dh67.56bn) a year, according to the UK department for business innovation and skills (BIS). Complexity For airlines, maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) is a costly business. Globally, airlines spent US$62.1bn on MRO, representing around 9 per cent of total operational costs, according to Iata. The MRO industry posted a 2014 net post-tax profit of $19.9bn, compared to $10.6bn in 2013. With a 3.8 per cent increase per annum anticipated, the market size is estimated to reach $90bn in 2024, Iata said. In 2014, the world fleet count was 24,597 aircraft, with 76 per cent of the fleet manufactured by Boeing or Airbus, the agency added. In a February survey, the BIS reported that "in terms of future prospects for the industry, several respondents identified what they felt to be a clear opportunity associated with the evolution of the MROL industry. The complexity and sophistication of activities conducted within the industry was felt to be intensifying – and doing so at an increasing rate. This is being driven by the need for increased aircraft serviceability, combined with MROL productivity and efficiency improvements through composite material technologies, data analytics and integrated logistics support." In this region, the growth of the ‘big three’ airlines is providing opportunites for MRO companies. One such is Olympus. The Japanese manufacturer of high-end optics and precision electronics is establishing its Middle East and Africa headquarters to Dubai. The facility will incorporate a state-of-the-art service and training centre for both support and knowledge transfer. From Dubai, the headquarters will cover 72 countries from across southern Africa to the Levant to Turkey to Arabian Gulf countries and elsewhere in the Middle East. Massive The move comes as the big three – Emirates, Etihad and Qatar Airways – are poised to expand their fleet by almost 650 new planes. "If you include Turkish Airlines and [others], the order book comes to a massive 1,058 passenger aircraft," says Maurice Faber, the regional managing director of Olympus. "With the market growing, our local presence here will help support our customers with stronger support on a variety of fronts including faster response times for service and product back-up." Periodic inspections of aircraft engines are mandatory by both manufacturers and regulatory authorities. Military aircraft are also subject to strict maintenance programmes. But, as you are sitting in a passenger plane waiting for take-off, have you ever wondered just how engineers manage to inspect a piece of machinery as complicated and crucial as the engines? "An aircraft engine is a very complex machine. But manufacturers have provided certain areas within the engine that have access ports to facilitate visual inspection with endoscopes," says Mr Faber. Failure Recently, aircraft have been required to have on-condition maintenance performed, which relies on the capability to detect failures before they happen, so preventive maintenance can be initiated, according to the South Korean industrial endoscope, or borescope, maker Medit. "Borescopes are becoming instrumental and required to perform these types of inspections," the company says. "If, during an inspection, maintenance personnel can find evidence that the equipment is approaching the end of its life, then it may be possible to delay the failure, prevent it from happening, or replace the equipment at the earliest convenience, rather than allowing the failure with severe consequences to occur. Modern airplane and helicopter engines are already equipped with endoscope bores." Olympus is also a supplier of aviation endoscopes and works closely with industry leaders such as Boeing and Airbus among others. Similar to endoscopy used by doctors to examine patients, these thin, flexible, ultra-high tech tubes are inserted into the access port of an engine. The tube usually has a couple of optical cables, each of which may have up 50,000 optical fibres. The cables carry light and cameras to see inside the engines. "However, because of the complexity of the engine, there still are various difficulties an inspector may face when attempting to conduct an engine inspection precisely and in a timely manner," Mr Faber points out. Laborious Commercial jets are equipped with turbofan engines, which vary in size from small turbines for regional jets to large turbines for larger, inter-continental airliners. Furthermore, there are many different parts to be inspected within each engine, such as turbine blades, compressor blades and the combustion chamber. It is important when conducting a smooth and accurate inspection, to choose the optimal endoscope and related accessories by engine type and engine part, Olympus says. "At Olympus, we use a single Iplex videoscope that can cover various demands for aircraft engine inspections by just changing the optical adaptors," Mr Faber says. In the past, one aspect of engine inspection involved the laborious procedure of rotating the engine shaft by hand for inspection of the hundreds of blades, which are located at several turbine/compressor stages and mounted on the shaft. It was a two-man operation where one engineer manually rotated the shaft while another inspected the condition of the blades. This work not only required an additional operator for the shaft rotation, but was also a less reliable method. Today, specific engine turning tools are used, which automatically rotate the shaft with high-pressure compressor/turbine blades at a preferred speed, enabling one inspector too accurately and thoroughly conduct both the shaft rotation and blade inspection operations without the need for a second person. Images Recording a large number of blade images for inspection analysis and reporting is necessary, but the images are very similar to each other, meaning attempting to find and sort the data is difficult. To help in this area, Olympus uses its inspection assist software. After an inspection, the engineer can efficiently analyse the recorded images and immediately create a report, just by selecting desired images with one-click operation, the company says. Its InHelp product is inspection data management and reporting software for Olympus Industrial videoscopes that streamlines all aspects of on-site inspections. It is designed to improve work efficiency by organising stored images and generating detailed inspection reports. Keeping a jet engine in good condition is a constant operation. "Some basic maintenance occurs on virtually every flight – when the flight crew visually checks the engine condition, lubricant levels and various points designed to highlight an anomaly – such as a dysfunctional low-oil level indicator or any other component indicating something out of specification," the US aviation journalist Dave Higson tells AvBuyer, an aircraft broker. "Other powerplant maintenance items arrive largely on an hours or cycles-based schedule, and include the two major events in the life of any turbine engine: the hot-section inspection (HSI); and engine overhaul." While some overhauls are proscribed as on-condition events, the HSI generally arrives at a set time period. "For engines with a proscribed TBO [time between overhaul], HSI events tend to arrive at the mid-point between zero hours and the TBO limit. For engines with an on-condition TBO cycle, however, HSI times are typically set on a firm schedule, whether 1,500 hours, 1,800 hours, 2,000 hours, or more," Mr Higson says. Invaluable "The downtimes vary and costs vary accordingly, but anticipate a low six-figure fee to be a starting point for engines that cost in the high six-figures new. Anticipate seven-figure fees for powerplants with new-production prices well into eight-figure sums. One engine-shop operator uses a rule of thumb that overhauls will cost one-third to one-half of the engine’s cost when new," he adds. "Regardless of the renewal costs, the necessity remains to help engines reach their limits, remain cost-effective and, most importantly, reliable and safe." So hats off to the backroom boys and girls whose work is seldom seen but whose efforts are invaluable in keeping our planes in the air. chnelson@thenational.ae Follow The National’s Business section on Twitter Pages: Loading...

Not just because Donald Trump was elected the 45th president of the United Stated or because the UK decided to leave the EU, but the markets’ reactions to these events were even more surprising and most forecasters got it wrong. A new year has started and many questions remain to be answered; here are some of the most asked questions for 2017: Will the Trump rally carry on? How many rate hikes will the Fed deliver? What is the future of the UK and the EU? Will OPEC finally balance the oil markets? Will the Trump rally carry on? Following the election of Donald Trump on November 8, all U.S. major indices recorded new highs. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 8%, S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite gained 5%, and the small-cap stock market index Russell 2000 outperformed its peers rising by more than 13%. From a market valuation perspective, very few may disagree that stocks are expensive, but the expected combination of fiscal stimulus and deregulation for some sectors under Trump’s presidency were the main catalysts for the rally. Of course, financial markets tend to price in events before they occur, but this time I believe investors have priced in most of the good news, and it requires very strong corporate profit growth to keep this bull market alive. Predicting the end of the bull market is a tough call, but the downside risk in 2017 is likely to be larger than the upside potential. If U.S. policy makers succeed in delivering the anticipated growth we can see another 5 – 10% gains in U.S. stocks, but failure to do so will cause a steep selloff that could exceed 20%. Day traders may be luckier than investors in 2017 as a new indicator has been added to their watch list:Trump’s twitter account. On December 6, Trump tweeted “Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!”, few seconds later Boeing stock wiped almost $1 billion from its market cap. We expect to see more of these tweets in 2017 and algorithms will probably require long time to put them into play, leaving retail traders with opportunities to profit from such market disruptions. How many rate hikes will the Fed deliver? 2016 kicked off with the expectation that four rate hikes wouldoccur, but only one was delivered in December. Although it was anticipated that the Federal Reserve will be more cautious in their forward guidance for 2017, December’s meeting took many economists by surprise as they hinted for three rate hikes. Since the financial crisis in 2008 the Fed has got many things wrong, whether it is forecasting rate hikes, economic growth and inflation levels, and now with a new administration to take office on January 20, this could make the Fed’s projections even more complicated. Inflation has always been the main justification for low interest rates, but now, even before Trump takesoffice, a couple of inflation gauges are running above 2%. The Fed did not account for any fiscal stimulus measures in their most recent projections, suggesting that huge shifts in expectations may be seen. The rising U.S. dollar which is currently at a 14-year high is another source of worry for the Fed, and tightening too fast will lead to even stronger dollar hitting U.S. exports and multinational companies’ profits. If Trump’s measures were passed and economic growth picked up, the Fed will have few options, either tightening monetary policy more aggressively, or to fall behind the curve and let the fixed income market lead the way, but three rate hikes in 2017 is my base case. Either way the dollar is likely to remain strong as divergence in monetary policies will continue to widen. Future of the UK and the EU? Hard, Soft or Grey Brexit. This was the most argued topic in the past six months, and until now there’s no clear path on what direction the UK will move. The pound ended 2016 17.5% lower against the US dollar since June 23 and there’s lot of speculation on how it will end in 2017. Of course, much will depend on the path Britain will choose. Theresa May promised to trigger Article 50 by the end of March, but we still need to hear from the Supreme Court on whether the UK government needs parliamentary approval before starting the withdrawal from the EU. The delay in triggering Article 50 will be positive in the short term for sterling, and negotiations may last well beyond 2017 on the terms of Brexit. Meanwhile investors will be focusing on the economic developments and the direction of the Bank of England’s monetary policy, which will probably be the second major central bank to raise rates after the Fed. Politics within the EU will rule investment decisions in 2017. Germany and France, the two largest economies will hold elections amid the rise of Eurosceptic candidates. Italy is likely to see an early vote, after the resignation of Matteo Renzi last month, and the Five Star Movement has vowed that if it wins power it will hold a referendum on whether Italy should leave the Eurozone. Although many polls indicate that far right candidates are still behind, nothing should be taken for granted after Trump won the U.S. presidency and Britain voted to leave the EU. Expect to see more pressure on the Euro and look out for parity against the dollar in the first six months. Will OPEC finally balance the oil market? After hitting a low of $27 a barrel in February 2016, Brent prices more than doubled by the end of year and many investment banks still see further increase in prices for 2017. OPEC’s decision to cut its output by 1.2 million barrels a day starting January, and non-OPEC producers to cut 558K barrels for the next six months to drain record global oil inventories led Brent prices to post its first yearly increase since 2012. Whether more appreciation is to be seen in 2017 will depend on multiple factors, and the biggest one currently looming is compliance to production cuts. It’s in no one’s interest not to comply, but historic figures show that delivering on previous production cuts has been poor. U.S. producers are another element to be focused on, how fast shale may come back is a key component to be considered in the price equation. Although Trump has made the energy sector part of his economic growth plan, I believe it won’t have a lot of impact if prices don’thold up. The dollar strength will likely impact the demand side, as continued strength will make oil more expensive in other currencies.   About the Author Forex Time The FXTM brand provides international brokerage services and gives access to the global currency markets, offering trading in forex, precious metals, Share CFDs, ETF CFDs and CFDs on Commodity Futures.

NASA said Wednesday that Boeing and SpaceX each have six orders for crewed missions now under the companies’ respective Commercial Crew Transportation Capability contracts with the space agency. Phil McAlister, director of NASA’s commercial spaceflight development division, said the additional missions will aid the stability of the crew rotation schedule and address schedule and financial uncertainty for commercial providers. The new awards currently do not include payments and are meant to help contractors plan for the missions and address space station transportation needs, NASA noted. Boeing’s CST-100 Starliner and SpaceX’s Crew Dragon commercial crew spacecraft will work to carry up to four astronauts and 220 pounds of cargo as well as feature a lifeboat function to evacuate astronauts from ISS in case of an emergency. The Commercial Crew Program aims to increase the number of astronauts aboard the space station and provide more time for research to study the impact of long-duration human spaceflight within the low-Earth orbit. Boeing’s uncrewed flight test, dubbed Orbital Flight Test, is scheduled for June 2018 while the company’s crewed flight test is slated for August 2018. SpaceX plans to conduct its Demonstration Mission 1 uncrewed flight test in November and perform a crewed flight test in May next year. Actual missions to ISS will begin once flight tests are complete and NASA has issued certifications for providers.

Skip to content Military Technologies pr@satprnews.com Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 4 January 20174 January 2017 by Ethiopian Sets Yet Another Year of Growth Milestones Africa’s largest Airline Group, Ethiopian Airlines, is pleased to announce that it has ended yet another year of fast and profitable growth in 2016, highlighted by fleet and network expansion as well as significant investment in customer services. NEW YORK, NY, January 04, 2017 /24-7PressRelease/ — Recapping the Airline’s performance in 2016, Group CEO Ethiopian Airlines, Mr. Tewolde GebreMariam, said: “2016 has been an exceptionally challenging year for the African Aviation industry. Commodity exporting countries in general and oil exporting African countries in particular have been hit hard by the global decline of commodity prices. As a result, demand for air travel has been suppressed and the shortage of foreign exchange has severely affected the financial performance of airlines in the continent. Yet, at Ethiopian, we are very proud of the new heights Ethiopian has flown in the year: we celebrated our 70th anniversary, inaugurated the largest and the finest Aviation Academy in Africa and a state-of-the-art In-flight Catering facility which is the largest in the continent of Africa, introduced Africa’s first Ethiopian Airbus A350, and spread our wings to more countries on 5 continents. “Despite the sluggish growth in the world’s matured market, all of our 12,000 colleagues remained focused on the robust execution of our vision 2025, which has proved to be a winning strategy in today’s hyper-competitive and complex airline business. We wish to thank our valued customers for their continued vote of confidence on our services and for making Ethiopian as their airline of choice.” Major Diversification on the Core Fleet: Ethiopian has increased its fleet by 8 aircraft in 2016 and has closed the year with 82 airplanes in service. For the first time in its history, Ethiopian has diversified to include Airbus aircraft, with Africa’s first A350. With an average fleet age of just five years, Ethiopian has one of the youngest and most modern fleet in the world. Ethiopian has heavily invested in the two most technologically advanced fleet of our time; the B787 Dream Liner and the A350. With high performance, less carbon emission, advanced cabin features, and superior customer comfort, these airplanes are game changers in today’s civil aviation industry. Efficient Network of Convenient connectivity Living its motto of Bringing Africa Together and Closer to the World, Ethiopian has continued to connect the African continent with its major trading cities and markets. With connections as short as 30 minutes at our Addis Ababa hub airport, we offer the fastest travel time between Africa and the rest of the world for our customers. Both through our main hub in Addis and our regional hubs in Lome (Togo) and Lilongwe (Malawi), we are connecting African brothers and sisters scale up tourism, trade and investment with in the continent. In 2016 we launched new international flights to the Comoros Islands, Windhoek, and Newark and domestic routes to Hawassa, Kebridahar and Dembidolo. Ethiopian Cargo Services has also remained to be the largest cargo airline in Africa. Customer experience investments We have also been honored by the ways our world class service has been recognized: SKYTRAX World Airline Award for Best Airline Staff in Africa and Rising Star Carrier of the Year Award (both for the second year in a row), Cargo Airline of the Year, and African Airline of the Year Award are few to mention. Redefining our passengers’ onboard experience, we have successfully completed the modification of all our Boeing 787 Dreamliners with lie-flat beds. We have expanded and renovated our lounges in our Addis hub. In line with our new Inflight catering facilities, we have invested in upgrading our inflight meals with new menus, new cutlery, on board plating, new chinaware and new service delivery. We have also revamped our ShebaMiles Frequent Flyer Program with a major focus on enhancing our customers’ experience. On the ground, new advance check-in procedure to enable customers check-in at their convenience, newly designed website, self-check-in and self-boarding. Infrastructure Aviation Academy: Ethiopian has built largest and the latest Aviation Academy in Africa, with an investment of USD 100 million. The Academy has the best aviation training technology that an airline academy can offer; full range of fleet cabin emergency, evacuation and door trainers fitted with a high standard swimming pool for cabin crew ditching exercises and more than 20 pilot training aircraft, Class Rooms, Student Cafeteria, Auditorium Hall, Student dormitory, Green compound with space for outdoor sports. Cargo: The New Cargo Terminal, 82% complete, is expected to be operational towards April 2017, which will have an annual storage (for both dry and perishable goods) of 1.2 million tons and a capacity to handle eight B747-800 freighters at a time. Construction of the first phase only will cost approximately US$ 150 million. Upon completion, our uplifting capability will be equivalent to the cargo terminals at Amsterdam Schiphol, Singapore Changi or Hong Kong. A Four Star Hotel construction: with the booming construction in our capital Addis Ababa, Ethiopian’s four star hotel construction is progressing, with 30 percent completion. The hotel will have 330 rooms, a banquet hall to accommodate 2000 guests, restaurants, a swimming pool, gym, and spa. Catering: Ethiopian has inaugurated the largest Catering Facility in Africa, with a capacity more than all hotels in the city combined: 100,000 meals per day. It will soon commence third-party service and generate revenue to continue as an independent profit center. Maintenance Hangar: The newly built wide body maintenance hangar is now 97% completed. The hangar has two bays equipped with latest technologies; a full Paint hangar, and Maintenance hangar. The facility is capable of accommodating 2-B747-800 (the biggest Boeing airplane) at a time or more other type of aircraft in different arrangements. Simulator: Ethiopian has constructed a state-of-art flight simulator building and installed five of the latest full flight simulators (FFS). This includes; the Boeing 787, 777, 757, 767, 737NG and the Bombardier Q400. Likewise, we are on our way to have full flight simulators for A350XWB and Boeing B737 MAX aircrafts. Corporate Social Responsibility: During the 2016 Ethiopian has partnered with significant number of local and international organization to discharge its corporate Social responsibility. To mention a few: Free Shipment of Medicine by Airlink USA, Shipment of Colonel John Charles Robinson’s Sculpture, humanitarian shipment for UNICEF Ethiopia and free ticket grants to support medical travelers abroad. About Ethiopian About Ethiopian Ethiopian Airlines (Ethiopian) is the fastest growing airline in Africa. In its seven decades of operation, Ethiopian has become one of the continent’s leading carriers, unrivalled in efficiency and operational success. Ethiopian commands the lion’s share of the pan-African passenger and cargo network operating the youngest and most modern fleet across five continents. Ethiopian fleet includes ultra-modern and environmentally friendly aircraft such as Airbus A350, Boeing 787, Boeing 777-300ER, Boeing 777-200LR, Boeing 777-200 Freighter, and Bombardier Q-400 double cabin. Ethiopian was the first airline in Africa to own and operate each of these aircraft. Ethiopian is currently implementing a 15-year strategic plan called Vision 2025 that will see it become the leading aviation group in Africa with seven business centers: Ethiopian Domestic and Regional Airline; Ethiopian International Passenger Airline; Ethiopian Cargo; Ethiopian MRO; Ethiopian Aviation Academy; Ethiopian In-flight Catering Services; and Ethiopian Ground Service.

NASA took another big step to ensure reliable crew transportation to the International Space Station into the next decade. The agency's Commercial Crew Program has awarded an additional four crew rotation missions each to commercial partners, Boeing and SpaceX, to carry astronauts to and from the International Space Station. The four additional missions will fly following NASA certification. They fall under the current Commercial Crew Transportation Capability contracts, and bring the total number of missions awarded to each provider to six. The additional flights will allow the commercial partners to plan for all aspects of these missions while fulfilling space station transportation needs. The awards do not include payments at this time. "Awarding these missions now will provide greater stability for the future space station crew rotation schedule, as well as reduce schedule and financial uncertainty for our providers," said Phil McAlister, director, NASA's Commercial Spaceflight Development Division. "The ability to turn on missions as needed to meet the needs of the space station program is an important aspect of the Commercial Crew Program." The two commercial spacecraft also will provide a lifeboat capability to allow the astronauts aboard the station to return safely to Earth in an emergency, if necessary. Returning human launch capabilities to U.S. soil underscores NASA's commitment to the station and the research that the orbiting laboratory makes possible including the advancement of scientific knowledge off the Earth, for the benefit of those on the Earth and to prepare for future deep space exploration. The Commercial Crew Program will help NASA get full operational use from the national laboratory for scientific research by increasing the number of astronauts on the space station, and allowing the crew members to dedicate more time to research. The commercial crew vehicles will transport up to four astronauts for NASA missions, along with about 220 pounds of critical cargo to the space station. More time dedicated for research allows NASA to better understand the challenges of long-duration human spaceflight without leaving low-Earth orbit. As NASA develops the Orion spacecraft and the Space Launch System rocket for deep space missions, including the journey to Mars, NASA is turning over low-Earth orbit crew and cargo transportation to commercial companies. This two-pronged approach is critical to achieve the agency's exploration goals. Boeing's uncrewed flight test, known as an Orbital Flight Test, is currently scheduled for June 2018 and its crewed flight test currently is planned for August 2018. SpaceX's uncrewed flight test, or Demonstration Mission 1, is currently scheduled for November 2017, followed by its first crew flight test in May 2018. Once the flight tests are complete and NASA certifies the providers for flight, the post-certification missions to the space station can begin. Boeing and SpaceX are developing two unique human space transportation systems. They also are upgrading necessary infrastructure, including launch pads, processing facilities, control centers and firing rooms. Boeing is developing the CST-100 Starliner that will launch on a United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket from Space Launch Complex 41 at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. SpaceX is developing the Crew Dragon to launch on the company's Falcon 9 rocket from Launch Pad 39A at the agency's Kennedy Space Center. Both are located on Florida's Space Coast.

ISSN 2330-717X Home News Opinion Analysis Business Social Religion Entertainment Environment Technology Health Dogfight Over Security Of Indian Skies To Begin Anew – Analysis India's Tejas fighter plane. Photo by Rahuldevnath, Wikipedia Commons. By South Asia Monitor January 4, 2017 By Gulshan Luthra* The dogfight over the choice of fighter jets – known as the Multi Role Combat Aircraft (MRCA) – that are to provide security for the Indian skies is beginning again, this time for a much larger number than the 2007 figure of 189 asked by the Indian Air Force (IAF), an estimated 400 for for the Indian Air Force (IAF) and 60 for and Navy. While IAF has already issued a global request for single engine combat jets under the government’s Make in India programme, the Indian Navy is looking for about 60 twin-engine shipboard fighters for delivery to begin within five years. The navy’s first Indigenous Aircraft Carrier (IAC 1) is due for delivery within the next couple of years, and the preferred choice this time is either the Boeing F/A 18 Super Hornet or French Rafale, which IAF has already decided to buy. The two single engine aircraft being considered by IAF are US Lockheed Martin F 16 Fighting Falcon and Swedish Saab Gripen, Boeing, which developed the F 18 as a shipboard fighter, has also offered to make it in India while sources in Dassault, which makes Rafale, told India Strategic recently that they are aware of the Indian requirements and should be submitting a proposal soon. Rafale was also developed as a shipboard fighter. IAF is buying 36 Rafale Medium Multi Role Combat Aircraft (MRCA) under a government-to-government basis and the first contractual payment of 15 percent was made in November to seal the deal. The first batch of six or so aircraft is to be delivered to IAF in 2019 as per the contract although India has requested the timelines to be advanced. Notably, shipboard jets are strong as they virtually have to crash-land on carrier decks on full power and it is easier to adapt them for lighter air force requirements. Conversely, it is difficult. Navy Chief Admiral Sunil Lanba had recently stated that the navy had jettisoned the indigenous naval variant of Light Combat Aircraft (LCA) because of low power. He did not specify the number or choice for the naval requirement but did say that only a couple of them are available in the market and that he wants them as fast as possible, say in about five years. He expressed confidence for speedy government approval. As for IAF, it has been losing two squadrons of Soviet-vintage Mig series aircraft every year, and although the numbers are being made up to an extent by the licence-production of 272 Russian Su 30MKIs, the depletion process of IAF squadrons is continuing. Notably, in 2007, the requirement for IAF was put at 126 plus 63 options (189) but their acquisition process under the MMRCA competition was scrapped in 2015 over price differences with the French Dassault whose Rafale was selected in 2012 against Eurofighter in the finals. The government then opted for a small number of 36 aircraft, or two squadrons, in 2015 for nearly Euro 8 billion inclusive of about Euro two billion for India-specific modifications and missiles as part of the package. Air Marshal VK Jimmy Bhatia (Retd), former Commander in Chief of the Western Air Command (WAC) and Air Marshal Ashok Goel (Retd), former Director General Inspection, say the Government should work towards both numbers and timelines. IAF needs to modernise 20 squadrons, or roughly 400 aircraft, as the need of the hour. An IAF fighter squadron, or Unit Establishment, has 18 aircraft for combat missions, and another two for training. At least three more are kept for Maintenance Reserve and Strike off Wastage (MRSOW). Notably, the acquisition process in India takes five to seven years, and that has to be factored in while planning for new jets. An IAF proposal to upgrade some 100 1970s-generation Jaguars with more powerful Honeywell engines and better avionics to extend their lives by 10 to 15 years is also pending for rather long in the Ministry of Defence. IAF’s operational strength of combat jets is around 700 aircraft, including the older Mig 21, Mig 27 and Jaguars. Its 25 to 30 year old Mig 29 and Mirage 2000 are however under upgrade, the latter by HAL in collaboration with the French Dassault, Safran and Thales which together make the Rafale. Both the IAF and Navy are looking for 4.5gen capabilities, that is what was stipulated for MMRCA, and plus in newer technologies, to keep up with the developments after 2007. Chief of the Air Staff Air Chief Marshal Arup Raha had told India Strategic that Boeing, Saab and Lockheed Martin had had made “unsolicited” offers under Make in India programme. Dassault and even Eurofighter could do the same and it would be up to the Government to consider them. All the five manufacturers took part in the aborted MMRCA competition along with Russian Mig 35. The navy apparently needs twin engine aircraft, and if they are to be made in India, then some commonality with IAF is required. IAF needs a combination of both. On the other hand, single engine jets are much cheaper to buy and operate, and if the aircraft are needed in large numbers, then the overall price will matter a lot. India’s Ministry of Defence has a tough choice, but one hopes for early decisions. *Gulshan Luthra is the Editor of India Strategic defence magazine and website, www.indiastrategic.in.

Previous post Next post 3 Comments on "Dogfight Over Security Of Indian Skies To Begin Anew – Analysis" Benith Israel Moses | January 4, 2017 at 12:00 pm | Reply I’m not an anti-national. I am just an arm chair critic. Seeing all this drama to again buy, one single engine, one twin engine and one more twin engine fighter (PAKFA). I say we have lost the plot. We should just buy F-35-A for Airfoce and F-35 C for 2nd aircraft carrier. We would definitely get screw driver technology for the numbers quoted time and again in the media. The US might just throw in a brand new bone, the EMALS technology for IAC 2 and follow on carriers. This technology transfer of licensed production and maintenance by HAL will go a long way will go a long way in building Indian military technological capabilities. This way DRDO can take its time to develop Tejas mk1,mk 1A, mk1B,mk 2, mk2A, mk 2B and heck yeah by 2050 we may even have first flight of AMCA. PS: The generals should first correct the ratio of fighter pilots to aircraft in the IAF inventory which stands currently at less than 1. Whats the point of having more aircraft if you don’t have anybody to fly them. Kiran | January 4, 2017 at 11:56 pm | Reply Good thought Israel, but will the Americans offer the F 35 to us? and even if they do, we might not be able to afford more than 2-3 squadrons shanx | January 5, 2017 at 5:27 am | Reply I have an even simpler idea. We just abandon the F16,F18,FGFA,Gripen and stick to Tejas and Su30mki. We should negotiate with Russia to acquire design, modification and upgrade ability on Su30mki in return for us buying 200 more of them. We continue to work with Sweden, France and USA to continually improve the Tejas. Ultimately the Su30mki and Tejas experience will pave the way for the AMCA.

He teamed up with state Sen. Kirk Watson, D-Austin, to file legislation — two bills in each chamber — pushing back against a pair of recent controversial Texas Supreme Court rulings that immediately made it easier for those involved with government contracts with private companies to shield parts of what those contracts say. Following those 2015 rulings, government entities have withheld a wide range of information from government contracts that had long been considered public. Such secrets include how much the City of McAllen paid pop star Enrique Iglesias to sing at a holiday parade, how many driver permits Houston had issued to the ride-hailing giant Uber and details of a Kaufman County school district’s food service deal. “Those were big steps away from that very important ideal that the public will have the information they need to hold government accountable,” Watson said of the Supreme Court rulings. “The public has the right to know what it’s paying.” In June of 2015, the justices ordered Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton to block the release of information in a lease between Boeing and the Port Authority of San Antonio because the aerospace manufacturer said making the details public could tip off its competitors. That ruling expanded the secrecy of government contracts in two key ways, experts say: by broadening an exemption in public records law used to protect the government’s competitive interests and by affirming that businesses could invoke it, too. Originally, lawmakers sought to prevent a bidder for government work from nabbing a competitor’s bids on a contract. And once that contract was finalized, it was considered public. But the Boeing v. Paxton decision lowered the threshold for what can be secret, while affirming that private entities could invoke that protection when doing business with governments in Texas. Since that ruling, Paxton’s office has been flooded by requests to shield the release of contract details — more than 300 have cited it, Watson said. Denton’s municipal electric utility cited that ruling in a successful effort to block the release of its $265 million contract to build a new natural gas-fired power plant, said Bill Patterson, publisher of the Denton Record Chronicle, which had asked for the information. “This project is the single largest capital purchase the city has made to date,” Patterson said, noting that electric ratepayers would be unable to watch for cost overruns or operational malfunctions.   One of the new proposals (House Bill 792 and Senate Bill 407) would limit the competitive interest threshold that governments could use to withhold information, and states that all finalized contracts would be released. Another proposal (HB 793 and SB 408) would restore a legal test that made private entities subject to state open records law under certain circumstances — if they receive public funds to perform services traditionally regulated to government agencies, for instance.  In March 2015, the Texas Supreme Court ruled that the Greater Houston Partnership, which received some public funds, could withhold details of contracts for economic services, because it was not entirely dependent on public funds. In doing so, it narrowed the definition of groups subject to open records law. The lawmakers said they had sought input from a variety of groups in crafting their legislation, including those who work on First Amendment issues, the Texas Municipal League and Texas Association of Counties. Laura Prather, a First Amendment attorney and a Texas Freedom of Information Foundation board member, said her group was “pleased” with the new legislation. “Texans need to know who the government is making deals with and how the money is being spent,” she said. Capriglione suggested that people in government “generally behave better if they know some people could be watching.” He said he was worried that the Public Information Act could be rendered “effectively moot” in Texas if the Legislature did not act this session and the “loopholes” became more widely used. He said he didn’t expect vocal opposition to the legislation though that didn't necessarily mean they would pass without a fight. “Whenever we try to broaden transparency, we've found that most of the people who battle it will do it in darkness,” Capriglione said.   The Texas Tribune provided this story.

Comments by Labour MP Kevan Jones were retweeted by Paddy Ashdown who backs his assertion that the Government sold Yeovil workers down the line when it signed a £425 million deal with Boeing in the summer for Apache helicopters. Lord Ashdown has long argued the deal to build the next generation of helicopters should have gone to Leonardo with GKN producing the airframes. Instead, there are no major new orders for Leonardo and GKN, which carried out contract work for the Italian giant on the AW159 Wildcat helicopter, is due to close in December with the loss of 221 jobs after bosses said it was "no longer viable". MORE: GKN closure : how one of Yeovil biggest stories of 2016 unfolded Mr Jones, MP for North Durham and a former defence minister, said: "The government's Apache deal with the US is a complete sell out. "If it was the other way round, the Americans wouldn't stand for such a poor deal, and now British workers are paying the price for this lack of investment in UK defence. "The UK helicopter industry is being taken apart." MORE: GKN crisis - Leonardo poised to move assembly jobs to Poland unless Government stops it says Ashdown GKN announced its site would be closing in December of this year last November, with the loss of 221 jobs. Lord Ashdown welcomed the comments - responding with a tweet, (below). At last! Someone else taking up the cudgels in Parliament to protect Yeovil's helicopter industry and jobs! https://t.co/kTT4rnrsIG ���� — Paddy Ashdown (@paddyashdown) January 1, 2017 Lord Ashdown has been heavily critical of the Government since the summer. He says the GKN closure is the Government's fault and has slammed its "foolish" failure to secure what was a key contract for Yeovil workers. "The workers at GKN have been let down by this government," he told Somerset Live at the time. MORE: GKN crisis - workers could find employment with Leonardo Helicopters says Marcus Fysh MP He blames the decision of the MOD not to put a new contract to supply the British Army with 50 new Apache helicopters in the summer out to competitive tender, for the closure of GKN. With the contract going to Boeing he says, any viability of the GKN site was going to be threatened. Ministers had claimed the UK industry would get a huge slice of support work for US building operations. But they have now admitted that the kick-back is worth only 5p in the pound of the overall value of the overall programme. Critics of the government say the new work will go nowhere close to compensating for jobs lost when GKN Aerospace closes its factory in Yeovil, Somerset, this year. MORE: GKN crisis: Yeovil MP Marcus Fysh 'will do everything he can' to safeguard jobs The problems for Yeovil's embattled aerospace industry appeared to have been compounded just before Christmas when the minister for defence procurement Harriett Baldwin seemed to be signalling to Lord Ashdown in a letter that work fabricating airframes for any new Wildcat orders would be undertaken in Poland - not in Yeovil. It had been hoped that the work would be done in the Leonardo site, possibly with the employment of at least some of the former GKN workforce, thereby utilising their valuable skills. Yeovil's MP Marcus Fysh has said he doesn't believe any decision has been made by Leonardo yet - he too is pushing for the work to remain in Yeovil. Leonardo has declined to offer any comment on the issue.

News Business Business News Donald Trump blasts General Motors for making cars in Mexico temporarily damaging the company's stock President-elect warns of 'big border tax' if car manufacturers keep producing cars south of the border Ben Chapman Tuesday 3 January 2017 14:23 BST Click to follow The Independent Online The next President of the United States has pledged to slap 35 per cent tariffs on companies that move production to lower wage countries Reuters US President-elect Donald Trump temporarily wiped almost a quarter of a billion dollars off the stock market value of General Motors on Tuesday after threatening to impose a “big border tax” for making its Chevrolet Cruze model in Mexico. “General Motors is sending Mexican made model of Chevy Cruze to US car dealers-tax free across border. Make in USA or pay big border tax!” Trump said on Twitter. GM, which owns Vauxhall and Cadillac among other brands, saw its shares fall 0.7 per cent in pre-market trading after the tweet, before recovering as the US stock market opened strongly. The incident will cause embarrassment to GM chief executive Mary Barra who last month agreed to join the new President’s economic advisory panel. Read more Thousands of jobs at risk as Vauxhall takes $400m Brexit hit GM defended against Mr Trump's accusation, saying: "All Chevrolet Cruze sedans sold in the US are built in GM's assembly plant in Lordstown, Ohio. "GM builds the Chevrolet Cruze hatchback for global markets in Mexico, with a small number sold in the US" The tweet is the latest example of Mr Trump’s online comments hurting multinational companies. In December shares in aerospace giants Lockheed Martin and Boeing also tumbled after Mr Trump criticised the cost of their US government contracts. Mr Trump blasted GM and other US car manufacturers on the campaign trail for their Mexico operations as he appealed to disenfranchised working class voters who have lost out amid increasing globalisation and the dismantling of trade barriers with lower wage economies.

In early July Mr Osborne said he wanted to push the levy on company profits to 15 per cent as a bold signal to global companies that the UK is still “open for business” despite the vote to leave the EU. In his speech to the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham today, Mr Hammond made no reference to that 15 per cent goal, merely referencing the existing policy for the levy to decline to 17 per cent. AFP/Getty “I am fighting hard to bring jobs back to the United States,” Trump said in a statement in June. “Many companies — like Ford, General Motors, Nabisco, Carrier — are moving production to Mexico.” He has consistently attacked the North American Free Trade Agreement which has helped to speed up the transition of manufacturing jobs to Mexico. The United Auto Workers Union has called for NAFTA to be scrapped but US car-makers say access to low-cost Mexican labour is crucial to their competitiveness. Mr Trump has also threatened import tariffs of 35 per cent on companies that shift production from the US.  More about: Donald Trump General Motors Reuse content Comments Most Popular Video Sponsored Features Follow us: User Policies Privacy Policy Cookie Policy Code of Conduct Complaint Form Contact Us Contributors All Topics Archive Newsletters Jobs Subscriptions Advertising Guide Syndication Evening Standard Novaya Gazeta Install our Apps Close We've noticed that you are using an ad blocker.

In a tweet, the President-elect said “General Motors is sending Mexican made model of Chevy Cruze to U.S. car dealers-tax free across border. Make in U.S.A.or pay big border tax!”, a warning which could be read as an effective ultimatum to move production back to the US or risk tariffs on foreign-made products. General Motors is sending Mexican made model of Chevy Cruze to U.S. car dealers-tax free across border. Make in U.S.A.or pay big border tax! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 3, 2017 Another potential problem for GM, as shown in the chart below, is that while GM has posted a substantial recovery since its bankruptcy following the financial crisis, the firm’s number of jobs has barely budged, even as its biggest “Detroit” competitor has been on a hiring spree. What makes Trump’s criticism surprising, however, is that one month ago, Trump appointed GM CEO Mary Barro to his Strategic and Policy Forum, which as a reminder “is composed of some of America’s most highly respected and successful business leaders, will be called upon to meet with the President frequently to share their specific experience and knowledge as the President implements his plan to bring back jobs and Make America Great Again.” If Trump’s tweet is sincere, Barra may be the first CEO who is “fired” from this particular advisory group. General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) fell $0.29 (-0.83%) in premarket trading Tuesday. In 2016, GM gained 6.30%, versus a 10.78% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Tuesday, 3 January 2017 | MYT 10:30 AM Seattle’s cloud-computing boom is new force driving regional economy by matt day Mounting a challenge: Sanders, a Microsoft engineer who leads a cloud-computing team, which worked on a key part of Microsoft's challenge to Amazon. "It was very daunting," Sanders said. — The Seattle Times/TNS SEATTLE: Western Washington state's economy has long been driven by companies that build complex systems, from Boeing's airplanes to cellular networks and the personal computer operating systems that gave rise to Microsoft.  Amazon.com's growth into a technology power through its Amazon Web Services cloud-computing unit and Microsoft's move to compete aggressively in that market have added the cloud to Seattle's list of specialties.  From 2013 to 2016, Washington's employed labour force grew by 7.2%, according to state occupational data. The number of workers employed in roles core to cloud computing – including computer-systems analysts, network architects and software-application developers – grew by 26%, to 80,017.  "There's an aspect of pride for the city," said Corey Sanders, a Microsoft engineer who leads a cloud-computing team. "You're a big cloud company? You're here."  From his old apartment, Sanders had a unique view of Seattle's cloud-computing boom.  His windows overlooked the two new towers at the core of Amazon.com's corporate campus, a building boom made, in part, to house the thousands of engineers who have helped make Amazon the undisputed leader in the business of renting computing power and data storage.  Meanwhile, he and his team worked on a key part of Microsoft's challenge to Amazon.  "It was very daunting," Sanders said of his charge when he joined the team building Microsoft's Azure. "We did have a very big competitor to look at."  Google is another major player in the Puget Sound area, with engineering offices in Seattle and nearby Kirkland. It's constructing a campus just blocks from Amazon's headquarters.  Facebook put the finishing touches this year on its own larger, custom-built engineering outpost in the city, and already has plans for another expansion.  Dozens of cloud-focused Silicon Valley transplants and startups are clustered throughout the area.  As with all booms, there's a downside.  The pressures of a roaring, technology-fuelled local economy have created what Seattle Mayor Ed Murray calls a housing-affordability crisis. Homelessness is on the rise, and the new buildings going up along with the high cost of living have dramatically changed the character of the city.  For those with the right in-demand technology skills, Seattle remains full of opportunity for second acts.  Deepak Patil, who spent 16 years at Microsoft, started work in January at Oracle as the Redwood City, California, company embarked on a hiring spree to help build its own cloud platform.  "We are in the middle of one of the most dramatic evolutions in modern civilisation," Patil said. "And Seattle happens to be the epicentre of this revolution."  Manuel Medina is among the generation of entrepreneurs that used both Microsoft and Amazon as a training ground.  He came to Seattle out of Harvard's business school in 2003, joining a team that later became a part of Amazon Web Services. The company, he says, was his second MBA.  Two years later, he jumped to Microsoft, pitching in on MSN, videogaming and mobile.  Now, he runs Outreach, a Seattle software startup that makes cloud-based tools for sales professionals.  Its service is built on Amazon Web Services. About-two thirds of Outreach's engineering staff, Medina says, came from Amazon.  It's still hiring. — The Seattle Times/Tribune News Service You May Be Interested Boosting women's libido Glass discards now included in waste separation law Better rates via online forex services Paying high interest rates for personal loans Purple should be your favourite CNY colour Chinese herb Dang Shen helps to boost strength Others Also Read Petaling Street traders expect slower sales for CNY Six suspected bomb makers with possible IS links nabbed Do we really need to fear China money? advertisement Latest News Create your own website Two thumbs-up for Oculus Touch Sci-fi tech set for 2017 QLED vs OLED PCs on the rise Most Viewed in Tech QLED vs OLED PCs on the rise Could your gadgets send you to jail?

Investigators with the Australian Transport Safety Bureau, the agency leading the hunt for the missing plane, revealed Wednesday in their weekly operational update that conditions late last month impacted the search — and could continue to pose problems going forward. "Weather has improved during the past week, although a cold front is moving across the search area today," the bureau wrote. "A ridge of high pressure will briefly dominate the search area on Thursday with another frontal passage expected on Friday." This weather could set back progress made by an autonomous underwater vehicle, or AUV, sweeping the floor of the Indian Ocean for evidence related to MH370. Over the past two weeks, the Fugro Equator's AUV has spent 23 hours on 10 missions, according to the bureau. These steps were the latest — and some of the last — in the search for MH370, a Boeing 777 that was presumed to have crashed after it mysteriously disappeared in March 2014. After a series of delays, the 120,000-square-kilometer, $145-million scan for debris from the plane was on scheduled to end this month. Related Stories Boeing To Lead New Search, Aviation Expert Claims Missing MH370 Plane Won't Be Found Near Search Area, Investigators Say But in December, officials collaborating with the bureau admitted in a report that they had "a high degree of confidence that the previously identified underwater area searched to date does not contain the missing aircraft." They identified another, 25,000-square-kilometer zone that "represents the next most likely area to contain the aircraft," the Guardian reported. However, whether the already lengthy search will continue past its January 2017 deadline remained unclear. Ministers from Malaysia, China and Australia agreed last summer not to keep up the hunt without new evidence, though recent reports alleged a private company like Boeing may take it over. Families of the 239 people who were on board MH370 when it vanished have also campaigned for an extension, last month even flying to Madagascar and Mauritius to look for debris themselves.   Join the Discussion Most Read Everything You Need To Know, Right Now.

The order is valued at $8.25 billion at list prices. The new order increases GECAS’s order book for 737 MAX 8 aircraft to 170, the largest number of bookings for the model by any leasing company. GECAS president and CEO Alec Burger said the CFM International LEAP-1B engines on these aircraft “deliver outstanding productivity and reliability in the single-aisle market.” The LEAP-1B is the sole-source engine for the MAX, which is scheduled to enter service in mid-2017 with launch customer Southwest Airlines. The GECAS deal brings Boeing’s order total for 737 MAX aircraft to 3,419. As of November, the rival Airbus A320neo—another re-engined narrowbody—had received about 4,800 orders from 88 customers.

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    As Donald Trump prepares to move into the White House, business leaders are neatly lining up talking points and leave-behinds, believing they are prepared to be heard in Washington after January 20. Think again. Ronald Reagan was the Great Communicator. Donald Trump will be the Great Disruptor. To be heard in Washington in 2017, business and leaders need to change to match the new president’s style and mission. What changed? Trump utterly disrupted politics, upending how Americans experience and receive information from a candidate, and thus from a new president. He used this strategy to endure a vicious pounding from Hillary and her unhappy band, pollsters, media, and fellow Republicans to win the greatest political upset since Truman defeated Dewey in 1948. He did this not by spending billions advertising on boring Sunday morning talk shows. Trump did this by bypassing mainstream media’s filter and directly engaging Americans through Twitter and other platforms to amplify his multiple interviews and pep rallies. Since his election, Trump has registered disruption internationally, infuriating communist leaders in China and totalitarianism thugs in Iran, who seem to have a lot to lose in a Trump administration. Most notably, Trump is using Twitter to communicate with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in front of the world, a contrast with the lackluster diplomacy of his predecessor. In business, Trump redefined what a president-elect can achieve by persuading United Technologies to keep more than 1,000 Carrier jobs in America, and Boeing and Lockheed to lower prices on defense contracts. Sprint announced it is bringing back 5,000 jobs to America. And on January 3, Ford cancelled its proposed $1.6 billion plant in Mexico, protecting 3,500 jobs in Michigan, adding $700 million in investments and 700 new jobs in America. Trump revealed that the precise tweet or viral video can move markets, jobs, contracts, legislation and millions of voters. Just after the new year, the House GOP revised course on an ethics bill creating a public firestorm capped by a Trump tweet. He has done all this — and not yet taken the oath of office. Change and disruption has only just begun. Based on many conversations and meetings with our corporate clients and trade associations, most have not yet accepted that this era will be as different and disruptive as the Jacksonian or New Deal eras. When corporate America addresses Washington, they do so through traditional channels of influence. None are adequate for the coming transformation. One channel is the voice of a CEO, a leader who can chat with POTUS, cabinet secretaries or senators, to seek support on taxes, trade, or regulation. More often, business speaks through trade associations. These large organizations — often housed in marbled palaces within a short cab ride of the Capitol — inspire "grass tops" messages to deluge politicians. Finally, there is the corporate lobbying-industrial complex armed with good arguments, data, endorsements, graphs, and promises of support for a politician’s broader agenda. None of these means are sufficient for imminent changes about to sweep Washington. Love Trump or hate him, business leaders must move beyond these traditional channels and adapt to the transforming political culture. They need to relearn how to speak, starting with the name of our country. The word “America” went out of fashion in the current administration, with corporations and lobbyists following suit, usually saying "the U.S.," which makes this country sound more like an institutional entity like the UN or the EU. One CEO in our past liked to boast about his globalist viewpoint. Though his company was based in New York — his brand was dotted across the American landscape — he proudly said to shareholders that his business "was in no sense an American company." He showed far less sensitivity in America than he did speaking in foreign nations. It is now time to speak again of "America" and what it stands for. Business must learn to communicate the way most Americans communicate, in short sentences and declarative English. Trump has used this skill in social media to disrupt traditional ways of moving voters, opinion and politicians. He has more than 40 million followers on social media, far more than twice the combined audiences of all the nightly news shows. And what do those news shows report? Whatever Trump tweets. Business leaders can also use social media more effectively, if they build friends and followers and speak in simple sentences about issues important to their audiences, not themselves. So in Trump’s America, when presented a stylistic choice between speaking Dayton or Davos, the default is always Dayton. And when the choice is between buying TV or ads in a failing newspaper, digital media usually wins. Now what should executives say about America? Start with "America First." In the Reagan era, the theme was national competitiveness. That’s the right idea, but it needs to be "Trumpcated" to what matters most — jobs. Executives must stress their policies and ideas that will create jobs, in America. And while you’re crafting talking points for important Washington meetings, or that upcoming speech, emphasize ways your company or trade association can retain, attract and create jobs — in America. Think in terms of rising incomes for families and communities, in America. This may not be popular at the next Council on Foreign Relations meeting. Furthermore, be careful speaking to Argentines who also think they are Americans. But if you learn to speak Trump, your talk about America is on track to be heard by this new administration, as well as Republicans now in control of both houses of Congress, 33 governor seats, and two-thirds of state legislative bodies. Talk about American jobs. Better yet, show your organization participating, not just watching. On January 3, a GM spokesman got into war of tweets with Donald Trump over the fraction of its compact cars imported from Mexico. Whatever the facts or merits of the case, GM had better take care in how it communicates on this, or it could be Trumped and Carriered.

News Business Business News Post-Brexit construction output surges despite 'intense pressure' from devalued pound Input costs rose at their fastest since April 2011, as rising imported raw material prices were passed down from suppli Ben Woods Wednesday 4 January 2017 15:25 BST Click to follow The Independent Online House building led the increase in activity Reuters The UK construction industry saw orders grow at their fastest pace in almost a year during December, but firms are still grappling with "intense cost pressures" caused by the Brexit-hit pound. The positive news from the Markit/CIPS survey, comes one day after manufacturers also signalled that activity was surging. UK Construction purchasing managers' index (PMI) rose to 54.2 last month, up from 52.8 in November and well above economists' expectations of 52.6. Read more UK construction industry hit by slowdown in October A reading above 50 indicates growth. The better-than-expected performance was driven by improved order books and a rebound in business conditions, with new order growth hitting an 11-month high. However, input costs rose at their fastest since April 2011, as rising imported raw material prices - driven by sterling's slump since the Brexit vote - were passed down from suppliers. It comes after separate PMI figures on Tuesday showed manufacturing output unexpectedly leap to a two-and-a-half-year high in December thanks to an exports boost from the plunging pound. Read more Don’t make shoppers pay for weak pound, Tesco boss warns Sainsbury's profits slump 10% as weak pound causes costs surge Why our post-Brexit economy can't be saved by slashing interest rates Tim Moore, senior economist at IHS Markit, said the PMI data showed the construction industry delivered a "solid rebound" in the final quarter of last year. "All three main areas of construction activity have started to recover from last summer's soft patch, but in each case growth remains much weaker than the cyclical peaks seen in 2014. "Housebuilding remains a key engine of growth for the construction sector, with the latest upturn the fastest for almost one year. "Meanwhile, commercial activity was the weakest performing category in December, reflecting an ongoing drag from subdued investment spending and heightened economic uncertainty." The PMI report said housebuilding was the best performing area of the industry, with housing activity delivering its fastest expansion since January. Rising workloads also bumped up employment levels, as recruitment grew at its quickest rate since May but remained "much weaker" than the average. Nearly half - 48 per cent - of the firms surveyed for the report expect business activity to step up over the next year, with business confidence hitting a three-month high.

In early July Mr Osborne said he wanted to push the levy on company profits to 15 per cent as a bold signal to global companies that the UK is still “open for business” despite the vote to leave the EU. In his speech to the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham today, Mr Hammond made no reference to that 15 per cent goal, merely referencing the existing policy for the levy to decline to 17 per cent. AFP/Getty Howard Archer, chief UK and European economist at IHS Global Insight, said the PMI report boosted hopes for a robust performance from the UK economy in the fourth quarter. "The improved December construction purchasing managers' survey follows on from the manufacturing survey showing activity picking up to a 30-month high in December. "This buoys hopes that the UK economy continued to hold up pretty well in the fourth quarter of 2016 after resilient expansion of 0.6 per cent quarter-on-quarter in the third quarter following June's Brexit vote. "A healthy December purchasing managers' survey for the dominant services sector would be particularly reassuring."

James Mattis (Credit: a katz / Shutterstock.com)    5404927 Newly designated Secretary of Defense James Mattis reportedly assured U.S. senators of his commitment to move forward with the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program, which President-elect Donald Trump previously suggested had problems. Trump tweeted Dec. 22 that he was asking the Boeing corporation to offer a competitively priced alternative to the F-35 program, which is the current flagship fighter program of the U.S. The F-35 program is the most expensive weapons program in U.S. history, costing U.S. taxpayers nearly 400 billion dollars. Trump repeatedly expresses ire at the program’s cost overruns, and indicates he is open to radical cost-saving maneuvers. The F-35 is built by defense contractor Lockheed Martin. Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal from North Carolina t0ld local Connecticut media that Mattis gave lawmakers a “clear commitment” to the F-35 program. “I was encouraged by his clear commitment to American air superiority and the important role of the F-35 program in sustaining and enhancing it,” Blumenthal said in a statement released after his meeting with Mattis. Lockheed Martin CEO Marillyn Hewson also gave Trump a “personal commitment” to “aggressively” drive costs down on the program. The willingness of Mattis to express divergent views concerning defense programs and the military generally, is reportedly what endeared him to Trump, along with his reputation as a tough fighter. In his initial interview with Trump, Mattis pushed back against Trump’s professed desire to bring back enhanced interrogation techniques on suspected terrorists.

Rebecca Cook/Reuters | Caption Ben Rosen Staff | @Benji_Rosen January 4, 2017 —The @realDonaldTrump was at it again Tuesday, threatening in 140 characters to impose a border tax on the Chevrolet Cruze cars General Motors manufactures in Mexico. An early morning Twitter post sent GM shares on a 1 percent tumble before the market opened, although they rebounded to close up, at $35.15 by the end of Tuesday.  The tweet came hours ahead of an announcement that Ford Motor Company has halted plans to build in Mexico a $1.6 billion assembly plant, a repeated target of Mr. Trump in his criticism of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) between the United States, Mexico, and Canada. Instead, Ford said Tuesday it now plans to invest $700 million in a Michigan factory to build new electric, hybrid, and autonomous vehicles. General Motors, the nation’s largest automaker, became the latest American manufacturer Tuesday caught in the crosshairs of Mr. Trump’s Twitter account. The president-elect has slammed Ford, United Technologies, The Boeing Company, and Lockheed Martin on social media since he was elected Nov. 8. In doing so, Trump has already inserted himself into corporate affairs more than his predecessors in the White House, experts say. But it’s unclear how his direct criticism of one automaker, be it GM or Ford, could affect the industry as a whole. It’s unlikely one tweet will force a manufacturer to scrap months of planning, since any change in vehicle production would require a carmaker to build a brand new facility. But it could lead to different forms of rhetoric among those in Detroit, says Nathan Jensen, a professor at the University of Texas at Austin who has studied the relationship of businesses and governments. How much do you know about the auto industry's future? A “company could think of ways to allow an administration to claim some credit for the opening of new factories,” Professor Jensen tells The Christian Science Monitor in a phone interivew. Conversely, Ford and GM have each gone on the defensive against Trump.   On Tuesday, an Android phone (an indication Trump may have authored the post himself) tweeted “General Motors is sending Mexican made model of Chevy Cruze to U.S. car dealers-tax free across boarder. Make in U.S.A. or pay big border tax!”  General Motors is sending Mexican made model of Chevy Cruze to U.S. car dealers-tax free across border. Make in U.S.A.or pay big border tax!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 3, 2017 The president-elect did not provide further details. But General Motors promptly responded, publishing a brief statement on its website. The automaker said it manufactures the Cruze sedan in Lordstown, Ohio, and builds the hatchback version in Mexico “for global markets” “with a small number sold in the US.” According to Automative News, GM began to produce the Cruze in Mexico last year, making 52,631 cars there. In comparison, it built 319,536 of them in the US. Previous versions of the Cruze sold in Mexico were made in a GM facility in South Korea. “In this case, the tweet was specific to General Motors,” said Trump transition team spokesman and incoming press secretary Sean Spicer. “But I think you've seen an overall philosophy during the campaign and since he was elected to stand up for American workers and make sure that American companies don't benefit from moving their companies overseas and leaving American workers behind.” Trump’s tweet also came hours ahead of Ford’s announcement it would cancel its plans for the $1.6 billion factory in Mexico in favor of a $700 million factory in Michigan. Ford chief executive Mark Fields said the decision to cancel the new plant was, in part, related to the company’s need to “fully utilize capacity at existing facilities” amid declining sales of small and medium-sized cars such as the Focus and Fusion. Mr. Fields also endorsed “pro growth” tax and regulatory policies expected under the Trump administration and a Republican Congress. But a Ford source told Reuters the company’s decision was directly influenced by Trump’s policy goals such as lowering taxes and regulations. During his presidential campaign, Trump pledged that, if elected, he would not allow Ford to build the assembly plant in Mexico. He said Ford’s plan was an “absolute disgrace,” and threatened to slap a tariff of 35 percent on imported Ford cars. But Ford’s actions appear to be as much about the shifting auto market as policies under Trump. Small-car sales have been hurt by shifting consumer demands and low gas prices. In fact, a trend among Detroit’s Big Three automakers has been to produce smaller cars in Mexico while taking advantage of higher-paid US workers to build more profitable, trucks, SUVs and luxury cars. Dr. Jensen at the University of Texas at Austin related Ford’s announcement to company’s relationships with governors. In a 2013 paper, Jensen and his colleagues published findings from a nationwide internet survey that suggested that a firm crediting a governor with its expansion can be politically beneficial to a governor's future campaign to remain in office. "Our findings illustrate a critical political benefit of offering such [tax] incentives," they write in the abstract. "Politicians can use these incentives to take credit for investment flowing into their districts and to minimize the political fallout when investors choose to locate elsewhere." Trump has also inserted himself into the aircraft manufacturing industry, sending company’s stocks briefly dropping in the process. In December, he attacked Boeing on Twitter for what he alleged were excessive costs to build two different Air Force One planes. Trump also twice used Twitter to slam Lockheed Martin’s development of the F-35, saying he asked Boeing to price-out a comparable F-18 Super Hornet “based on the tremendous cost and cost overruns” of the F-35.

News Business Business News Asia's richest families are abandoning hedge funds due to mediocre returns and high fees Family offices representing billionaires and multimillionaires are a key source of capital in the continent, where global pension funds haven’t made large inroads Klaus Wille Wednesday 4 January 2017 14:18 BST Click to follow The Independent Online Singapore-based wealth managers say their clients are increasingly looking towards private equity investments Reuters For Michael Preiss, whose firm oversees $1.9bn (£1.55bn) mainly for wealthy Asian families, adding hedge funds to his clients’ portfolios was an easy sell some years ago. Not anymore. The executive director at the Singapore-based Taurus Wealth Advisors multi-family office said his clients are disappointed with mediocre hedge fund returns and are balking at high fees, prompting them to shift to private equity. With redemptions already at a four-year high, Asia’s richest people comprise an investor group regional hedge funds can ill afford to lose. Family offices representing billionaires and multimillionaires are a key source of capital in Asia, where global pension funds and university endowments haven’t made large inroads. Managers seeking money for new hedge funds are likely to be the hardest hit. Read more UK hedge funds draw up Brexit wish list to prevent damage to the City “Asia’s hedge funds are smaller than their global peers, meaning they are more dependent on money from high-net-worth individuals and family offices,” said Melvyn Teo, professor of finance at Singapore Management University. “If family offices withdraw money, the region’s hedge fund industry will clearly feel the pinch.” UBS said in November family offices worldwide have turned away from hedge funds after they trailed stock markets in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. The trend is even more pronounced in Asia, where family offices set more aggressive performance goals, according to Eric Landolt, UBS’s head of family advisory for Asia Pacific. Read more Brexit-backing hedge fund billionaire warns UK economy 'about to crash Why hedge fund employees are departing to work for mutual funds Hedge fund bets against pound hit record highs in wake of Brexit Top 25 US hedge fund managers made $13bn in 2015 “Family offices are usually here to add wealth to the family,” said Landolt. “It is a growth engine for the family, whereas in Europe or the US there is a much stronger wealth-preservation angle.” Managers seeking capital from outside Asia may find few takers. Ray Nolte, chief investment officer of $8bn US-based fund of hedge funds SkyBridge Capital, last month said he’s shunning Asian hedge funds because of mounting risks in China’s debt markets. SkyBridge has less than 5 per cent of its assets in Asian hedge funds, Nolte said. That compares with 85 per cent in the US and 10 per cent in Europe. Hedge funds investing in Asia suffered $1.6bn of withdrawals through November, on track for the biggest outflows in four years, as their returns trailed the industry globally, according to the latest estimates from data provider Eurekahedge Pte. “The big hedge funds have become complacent, meaning they put more emphasis on the management fee than performance fee,” Taurus’s Preiss said. “For instance, a $1bn fund tends to focus on capital preservation and getting the management fee instead of working on a decent performance.” Business picture of the day 31 show all Business picture of the day 1/31 Fiat loses $2.3bn in stock value plunge after diesel emissions accusation - Thursday January 12 Shares in Fiat Chrysler plunged on Thursday after US authorities said that the carmaker had violated the Clean Air Act by allowing excess diesel emissions in some vehicles.

In early July Mr Osborne said he wanted to push the levy on company profits to 15 per cent as a bold signal to global companies that the UK is still “open for business” despite the vote to leave the EU. In his speech to the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham today, Mr Hammond made no reference to that 15 per cent goal, merely referencing the existing policy for the levy to decline to 17 per cent. AFP/Getty The ultra-rich families backing Taurus instead want to put their money directly into technology companies, according to Preiss. Taurus has about 10 per cent of client assets allocated to alternative assets. At $500m multi-family office Golden Equator Capital Pte, the shift has been even more drastic. Over the past two years, the share of assets allocated to hedge funds has more than halved to less than 10 per cent, while private-equity investments have doubled to 20 per cent, according to founder and chief executive Shirley Chua. Chua said her clients are particularly interested in closely-held US firms focusing on disruptive technologies such as car-hailing firm Uber Technologies Inc. or Magic Leap Inc., a US startup working on a device that simulates reality. “There is great interest in the unicorns,” said Chua, who before setting up Golden Equator assisted high-net-worth individuals from Asia and Europe as a director at Citigroup Inc. in Singapore. “Our clients want to participate in the new economy.” Taurus and Golden Equator are part of a wider shift that’s undermining hedge funds. The average share of alternative assets, mostly real estate and private equity, in Asian family office portfolios increased by 3 percentage points to 44 per cent in the two years through May 2016, according to UBS data. The proportion allocated to hedge funds fell 1 percentage point to 5 per cent. New hedge funds in Asia are particularly affected by the reluctance of family offices to invest, according to Singapore Management University’s Teo. “Especially for hedge fund startups, the bar has been raised because of this,” he said. “A lot of them depend not on institutional investor capital, but on capital from high net worth individuals and family offices so that they can get up to critical mass. It becomes a problem if family offices start to shy away from this.” Shiraz Poonevala, director of investments at Bangkok-based family office GP Group, which only invests its estimated $500m of assets directly, say it’s also a matter of Asia’s richest families wanting more control of their assets. “I look my boss in the eye every day, and I have to answer to him,” he said. “Maybe I don’t get super returns, but at the same time I don’t do super silly things because I have to see him every day. A hedge fund is like writing a check and then hoping for the best.” Bloomberg More about: Hedge Funds Reuse content Comments Most Popular Video Sponsored Features Follow us: User Policies Privacy Policy Cookie Policy Code of Conduct Complaint Form Contact Us Contributors All Topics Archive Newsletters Jobs Subscriptions Advertising Guide Syndication Evening Standard Novaya Gazeta Install our Apps Close We've noticed that you are using an ad blocker.

Maybe it was to save jack rabbit habitat. But the economic damage he caused to our state was greater than if he had shut down Boeing and Seattle. Grand Coulee Dam is one of the state’s most valuable assets. Yet, few on the west side could find it on a map. It is largest hydroelectric power plant in the U.S., and one of the largest in the world, and it was idled by Obama to force wind power’s higher electric rates on consumers. Grand Coulee transformed Washington’s dry mid-section into one of the most productive agricultural regions in the world. The Clinton/Obama “sound good” desert ecology policies haven’t saved one rabbit! And they have already cost your state more than $500 billion and tens of millions in lost lease revenue from state land and your school funds. Farm production and exports from the once dry Columbia Basin rival Boeing’s contribution to the state’s wealth. And, unlike Boeing, the farmers pay state and county taxes.

There was further evidence this week that the incoming president’s unusual approach is paying off after Ford cancelled plans to open a new plant in Mexico. It came one month after a Trump-brokered agreement with United Technologies to prevent 1,100 manufacturing jobs in Indiana from being moved out of the US. After his election win, Trump credited Twitter and other social media platforms with helping him beat Hillary Clinton despite her much higher advertising spending. “The fact that I have such power in terms of numbers with Facebook, Twitter, Instagram etc, I think it helped me win all of these races where they’re spending much more money than I spent,” he told CBS’s 60 Minutes programme. Trump has said he will rest his Twitter fingers when he is sworn in as the 45th president on 20 January. “I’m going to do very restrained, if I use it at all,” he said in the same interview. However, he has continued to use Twitter during the transition period, taking aim at multinational companies as well as his political opponents and the media. So far, it has produced results, with the French far-right leader Marine Le Pen applauding the Ford announcement as proof that “protectionism works”. Other companies have been affected by Trump’s solo social media campaign too. Ford and General Motors Carmakers Ford and GM were the latest companies to be targeted by Trump, raising the possibility that elements of US industrial strategy will be influenced and even formulated on social media. As the US returned to work on Tuesday morning after New Year celebrations, @RealDonaldTrump, who has 18.6 million followers, tweeted: Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) General Motors is sending Mexican made model of Chevy Cruze to U.S. car dealers-tax free across border. Make in U.S.A.or pay big border tax! January 3, 2017 GM shares immediately dipped 3% before recovering as the company pointed out that the vast majority of the cars it makes in Mexico are for international markets. Of the 190,000 Chevrolet Cruze hatchbacks sold in the US last year, just 4,500 were made in Mexico. During the election campaign Trump repeatedly vowed to bring in a 35% tax on cars made in Mexico and sold in the US. At the moment, US companies can import goods from Mexico without paying any tax thanks to the North American free trade agreement (Nafta), which Trump has described as “the worst trade deal maybe ever”. Trump has repeatedly threatened to renegotiate or “terminate” Nafta. The free trade deal had allowed cars to become a booming part of Mexico’s economy, with foreign companies investing more than $20bn (£16.3bn) in building factories in its rustbelt around Aguascalientes between 2010 and 2015. Trump appeared to have posted the 7.30am tweet without consulting Mary Barra, GM’s chief executive, whom he appointed last month to his strategic and policy forum, which he said would help him formulate his economic and business policies. “This forum brings together CEOs and business leaders who know what it takes to create jobs and drive economic growth,” Trump said at the time of Barra’s appointment. “My administration is committed to drawing on private sector expertise and cutting the government red tape that is holding back our businesses from hiring, innovating and expanding right here in America.” Hours after GM’s scolding, Ford, which has regularly been targeted by Trump over manufacturing in Mexico, announced it was scrapping plans for a $1.6bn plant in San Luis Potosí and instead would invest $700m in a Michigan assembly plant. Mark Fields, Ford’s CEO, said Trump’s “pro-growth policies” had partly led to the decision. “We look at a lot of factors as we make those,” he told Fox News. “One of the factors that we’re looking at is a more positive US manufacturing business environment under President-elect Trump and some of the pro-growth policies he said he’s going to pursue. And so this is a vote of confidence.” Trump celebrated, tweeting: Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) Instead of driving jobs and wealth away, AMERICA will become the world's great magnet for INNOVATION & JOB CREATION.https://t.co/siXrptsOrt January 3, 2017 Boeing Last month Trump criticised the aircraft manufacturer Boeing for the “out of control” cost of the new Air Force One 747 and called for the deal to be scrapped. The tweet led to about $1bn being wiped off the company’s market value before the share price recovered. Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order! December 6, 2016 Trump summoned the Boeing CEO, Dennis Muilenburg, to his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, telling reporters that he was trying hard to get costs down. Muilenburg said as he left the resort: “We’re going to get it done for less than that, and we’re committed to working together to make sure that happens. I was able to give the president-elect my personal commitment on behalf of the Boeing company.” Lockheed Martin Trump also hit out at Lockheed Martin over the cost of the next generation of F-35 fighter jets, tweeting last month: Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) The F-35 program and cost is out of control. Billions of dollars can and will be saved on military (and other) purchases after January 20th. December 12, 2016 Again, the tweet wiped billions off Lockheed’s market value. Trump expanded on his tweet on the Today show: “The planes are too expensive and we’re going to get the prices down, and if we don’t get the prices down we’re not going to order them.” He summoned Lockheed’s CEO, Marillyn Hewson, to the Florida resort. “I had a productive meeting with President-elect Trump,” Hewson said afterwards. “I appreciated the opportunity to discuss the importance of the F-35 programme and the progress we’ve made in bringing the costs down. The F-35 is a critical programme to our national security, and I conveyed our continued commitment to delivering an affordable aircraft to our US military and our allies.” Perhaps unsatisfied with the reaction, Trump announced on Twitter that he had asked Boeing to give him a quote on a different fighter jet option, the F-18 Super Hornet. The decision will also have an impact on the UK, which has been chosen as a possible location for an F-35 maintenance site. Britain’s £6.2bn aircraft carrier programme is designed for use by jump jets such as the F-35.

Arnd Wiegmann / Reuters Most Popular Seeking an Escape Hatch From Trump’s America Emma Green 7:00 AM ET Goodbye, American Apparel Bourree Lam Jan 14, 2017 The Curse of Econ 101 James Kwak Jan 14, 2017 My President Was Black Ta-Nehisi Coates Dec 13, 2016 The Trump Tweet Tracker The Editors Dec 28, 2016 David Brown Jan 4, 2017 Science Share Tweet … LinkedIn Email Print Text Size Last week, upon leaving the president-elect’s office, Douglas Brinkley, a historian and conservationist, reported that Trump “was very interested in a man going to the moon.” Before that point, the entirety of Trump’s utterances of space policy consisted of two sentences: “Honestly I think NASA is wonderful!” and “Right now, we have bigger problems… We've got to fix our potholes.” Brinkley’s remark suggests he might be thinking about a moon base, an idea long-favored by Newt Gingrich, one of Trump’s advisers. The constitution of his transition landing team at NASA, which includes lunar advocates, would seem to bear this out. The principal arguments for a moon base involve digging mines and building fuel depots. Though the moon lacks the resources to ever be truly self-sustaining, it only takes a few days to reach from Earth. If the U.S. decides that the goal of human spaceflight should be to gather resources, the moon and its quarry of helium-3 will be a compelling target. The isotope is extremely rare on Earth because of our magnetosphere. The moon has no such protection, and for billions of years it has collected the stuff by way of an unyielding fusillade from solar winds. There is an estimated 1.1 million metric tons of helium-3 on the moon. A mere 40 tons could power the United States for a year; if scientists are able to build a fusion reactor, we could shovel it into our nuclear power plants for centuries to come. There are also countless scientific questions that can be answered on the lunar surface. A telescope, for example, built on the far side of the moon and thus free of Earth’s ionosphere and radio interference would allow scientists to see the beginning of the universe. Chris Carberry, CEO and founder of Explore Mars, a nonprofit Mars advocacy group, argues that far greater opportunities exist on Mars, and that a return to the moon might delay Mars settlement by decades. Mars has carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and hydrogen—everything a colony needs to be self-sustaining. With those ingredients, you can do everything from manufacturing plastics to cultivating the soil. In other words, you can build a base on the moon, but a civilization on Mars. Moreover, Carberry says that the red planet has never been in a better position politically, culturally, or scientifically. “Right now we have an unprecedented level of support for Mars exploration,” Carberry says. “Frankly it would be foolish to throw that away. There's a huge amount of support on Capitol Hill. The Senate just passed a transition bill with the strongest Mars language ever put into legislation. The House did a previous authorization bill with very strong Mars language as well. There are many years of bipartisan support for Mars—also for the moon, but the strongest emphasis is on Mars. That goes for industry as well. Boeing, Lockheed, Aerojet Rocketdyne, SpaceX, and others put quite a bit of effort into designing a mission architecture.” American moon partisans owe a debt to Europe, which has tended the lunar flame during the ascent of Mars. Perhaps the most prominent moon advocate on Earth is Jan Woerner, the director general of the European Space Agency. Since assuming the post, he has argued persuasively that a “lunar village” is the natural successor to the aging International Space Station. It would be, in his view, a celestial point of harmony for a terrestrial species in discord. There is a problem, however: the Europeans have committed virtually no money to a moon village, and Russia, ESA's would-be partner in the venture, has no money to commit. They have already been forced to downsize their presence on the ISS due to costs, and have delayed plans for robotic exploration of the moon. (The head of the Russian space agency admits that Russia “does not have financial capabilities for advanced space projects.”) Lacking unity among member states, to say nothing of technology development and financial resources, what ESA really needs is for the United States to fund and spearhead such an effort. NASA's sights, however, are firmly fixed on Mars. With the presidential transition, however, and a new NASA director still to be appointed, lunar champions at home and abroad see an opportunity to abandon the Journey to Mars program and set sights a little closer to the Earth. To that end, ESA is on a moon base public-relations offensive, from the light and easy (magazine spreads and aspirational illustrations) to bare-knuckled politics  (publicly pressing the NASA administrator on the issue.) The overt message from Paris, where ESA is headquartered, is: We're doing this. The subtext is: While NASA plans a fantasy mission to Mars that will never happen, the rest of the world will be driving moon buggies and mining helium-3. But ESA’s campaign is powered by handwavium, and for all the illustrations of lunar domes and our great big blue marble over the horizon, progress on the moon base ends at Photoshop. If the U.S. doesn’t build the base, it won’t get built. Casey Dreier, the director of space policy for the Planetary Society, a nonprofit space advocacy organization, says that if any space agency really wants to land humans on the moon, let alone build a colony, there's no getting around the commitment to a program on the order of Apollo—a colossal commitment that ESA has not addressed.   “First you’d have to see a commitment to hardware that could get humans to the moon,” Dreier says. “Soyuz [the Russian-built spacecraft] doesn’t get to you there.” Even if deep space hardware for multi-week missions existed, however, there's the more fundamental problem of actually getting it into space. “You would need a new heavy launch rocket or plans that use existing rockets for in-orbit assembly of hardware, and that's just to get to the moon.” (Only American rockets in development have the requisite lift.) There's still the most challenging part of the mission: the lander. “Even more basically,” says Dreier, “ESA has to come together formally and commit votes. If there was a serious project, member nations would commit funds and decide things like: What do you do there?” The moon has always been part of NASA's Journey to Mars program. Though landing on the lunar surface is not part of the current plan, cislunar space—the 250,000 miles between the Earth and the moon—is essential. NASA calls it the “proving grounds,” and intends to develop that part of deep space to test life support and propulsion systems for any Mars expedition. Moreover, the Space Launch System (the colossal “Mars rocket” able to lift heavy payloads into space) and the Orion spacecraft for carrying astronauts into deep space are essentially holdovers from the Constellation program, the Mars space exploration initiative begun by President Bush in 2004 and canceled in 2009 by President Obama. The first stop on Constellation's roadmap was the moon, meaning SLS and Orion, both soon to roll off the assembly line, are moon-ready. Carberry says that if we change focus to the moon, however ill-advisedly, we should still do so in the context of going to Mars. He points to the Apollo program as a good example of how not to frame a space mission. The first time NASA went to the moon, it did so based on single reason: to beat the Soviet Union. Once that singular reason was accomplished, there will little will to maintain momentum. The long-term goal—Here is what this is all building toward—never entered the public policy discussion. “If you always have something beyond your current goal, it strengthens resolve to keep moving,” he says. “You strengthen your argument by making sure you have those longer-term goals—that this doesn't stop at moon. Hopefully it won’t come to that. If we can use the surface of moon within the framework of going to Mars, and we can stimulate commercial activity there, that's great, but if we put everything into the moon, we'll be stuck there for decades... Does US want to do a moon program forever? I don't know. Our advantage is clearly on Mars exploration.” That advantage goes beyond national pride. NASA has been successfully landing spacecraft on Mars for 40 years. No other nation has succeeded in doing this even once. Exploring Mars is difficult, as the crashed ESA-Russia Schiaparelli EDM lander confirmed in October. NASA has established a cadence of Mars missions, each more complicated than the last, each developing Martian science and engineering with eventual human exploration in mind. As long as the Mars missions continue, the agency can iterate on its carefully accumulated institutional knowledge. If that knowledge is wasted and manufacturing partners spin down, the entire Mars apparatus will have to be regrown from zero. This is the same problem NASA now suffers even in its limited plan to send astronauts to cislunar space. Although SLS and Orion are very far along in development, it will still be another five years at least before a crewed mission can be attempted to lunar orbit, replicating what Apollo 8 did 50 years ago. Wherever NASA is directed to go by the new administration will likely require a commitment that pushes the alternative back by decades. There’s simply no money in the NASA budget for both the moon and Mars. As the ISS demonstrated, building the thing—moon base or Mars colony—is the cheap part. It’s the operational costs that bog exploration down. Twenty percent of NASA’s budget goes to keeping the space station crewed and in orbit. A moon base will entail a similar such slice of the pie, which covers things like maintenance, ground support, technicians, engineers, physicians, launches, hardware, supplies, and food. You don’t maintain a moon base and gear up for Mars. Just the opposite: Going to Mars would specifically entail closing the moon base, which places Mars on the other side of lunar exploration, base design, base construction, base operations, base maintenance, and base divestment. NASA and world partners began work on the International Space Station began during Ronald Reagan’s first term. If we build a moon village, we’ll be there for a very long time.                                                                                                                          Casey Dreier maintains that there is no correct destination for human spaceflight. “To me,” he says, “the least interesting argument in space exploration is ‘moon or Mars.’ It’s an important decision, but not an interesting argument. Mars is not objectively the only answer. The fundamental issue at play is what do we do that pays dividends as nation.” What dividends should we look for? Elon Musk advocates Mars colonization by defining Mars as humanity's failsafe—that once we settle and flourish on a second world, no matter what catastrophe might befall Earth, be it an asteroid or atomic devastation, the human species can survive. NASA frames Mars exploration in more hopeful terms, calling it a scientific endeavor through which we can learn about the evolution Earth and life. Either way, those are enticing and worthy goals. Astronauts can press boot prints into Martian soil in less than 20 years, but for that to happen, NASA must stay the course.

A video essay on the future of urbanization Nadine Ajaka Jan 12, 2017 previousOpening Paragraphs Don’t Always Have to Be ExcitingnextMistakes in 'Paleo' Eating Most Popular Presented by Chelsea Beck Seeking an Escape Hatch From Trump’s America Emma Green Why some Americans are withdrawing from mainstream society into “intentional communities”—and what the rest of the country can learn from them VIRGINIA— For the last eight years, Nicolas and Rachel Sarah have been slowly weaning themselves off fossil fuels. They don’t own a refrigerator or a car; their year-old baby and four-year-old toddler play by candlelight rather than electricity at night. They identify as Christian anarchists, and have given an official name to their search for an alternative to consumption-heavy American life: the Downstream Project, with the motto to “do unto those downstream as you would have those upstream do unto you.” As it turns out, exiting the system is a challenging, time-consuming, and surprisingly technical process. Here in the Shenandoahs and central Virginia, a handful of tiny communities are experimenting with what it means to reject the norms of contemporary life and exist in a radically different way. They seem to share Americans’ pervasive sense of political alienation, which arguably reached an apotheosis with the election of Donald Trump: a sense of division from their peers, a distrust of government. The challenges of modern politics—dealing with issues like climate change, poverty, mass migration, and war on a global scale—are so vast and abstract that it’s difficult not to find them overwhelming. But instead of continuing in passive despair, as many Americans seem to do, the people in these communities decided to overhaul their lives. Continue Reading Carlo Allegri / Reuters Goodbye, American Apparel Bourree Lam The 19-year old company has been purchased for $88 million, which may be the brand’s last great marketing feat. It’s finally over for American Apparel, the trendy turned-scandal plagued clothing brand whose first store opened in 1997. On Thursday, a bankruptcy court in Delaware approved an $88 million sale of the brand’s intellectual property and manufacturing equipment to Gildan, a Canadian apparel company that focuses on wholesale. Gildan will pay an additional $15 million to acquire American Apparel’s purchase orders and inventory, effectively giving the buyer all the tools it needs to launch a new clothing line from the ruins of the now defunct brand. Millennials—especially those who identify with the term hipsters—likely remember a time in the early naughts when American Apparel’s snug, expensive t-shirts were emblematic of made-in-America cool. The company’s marketing blended the feel-good altruistic mission of making things in America while its advertising featured over-the-top sex appeal of one of America’s favorite traits: youth. Continue Reading Bettmann / Getty The Curse of Econ 101 James Kwak When it comes to basic policy questions such as the minimum wage, introductory economics can be more misleading than it is helpful. In a rich, post-industrial society, where most people walk around with supercomputers in their pockets and a person can have virtually anything delivered to his or her doorstep overnight, it seems wrong that people who work should have to live in poverty. Yet in America, there are more than ten million members of the working poor: people in the workforce whose household income is below the poverty line. Looking around, it isn’t hard to understand why. The two most common occupations in the United States are retail salesperson and cashier. Eight million people have one of those two jobs, which typically pay about $9–$10 per hour. It’s hard to make ends meet on such meager wages. A few years ago, McDonald’s was embarrassed by the revelation that its internal help line was recommending that even a full-time restaurant employee apply for various forms of public assistance. Continue Reading Ian Allen My President Was Black Ta-Nehisi Coates A history of the first African American White House—and of what came next In the waning days of President Barack Obama’s administration, he and his wife, Michelle, hosted a farewell party, the full import of which no one could then grasp. It was late October, Friday the 21st, and the president had spent many of the previous weeks, as he would spend the two subsequent weeks, campaigning for the Democratic presidential nominee, Hillary Clinton. Things were looking up. Polls in the crucial states of Virginia and Pennsylvania showed Clinton with solid advantages. The formidable GOP strongholds of Georgia and Texas were said to be under threat. The moment seemed to buoy Obama. He had been light on his feet in these last few weeks, cracking jokes at the expense of Republican opponents and laughing off hecklers. At a rally in Orlando on October 28, he greeted a student who would be introducing him by dancing toward her and then noting that the song playing over the loudspeakers—the Gap Band’s “Outstanding”—was older than she was. Continue Reading Spencer Platt / Getty / Zak Bickel / The Atlantic The Trump Tweet Tracker The Editors Monitoring the president-elect’s statements on Twitter—and analyzing what they mean President-elect Donald Trump has repeatedly issued announcements and proposals over Twitter, during both the presidential election and the transition period, embracing the medium as a superior means of communicating with the American people compared to relying on traditional media organizations. Incoming White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer has promised that Trump’s tweets will continue: “He has this direct pipeline to the American people, where he can talk back and forth,” Spicer recently explained to WPRI TV in Providence, Rhode Island, adding that Twitter allows him to “put his thoughts out and hear what they’re thinking in a way that no one’s ever been able to do before.” We’ll track and unpack Trump’s tweets here, according to our best understanding of their significance. Continue Reading Tom Pennington / Getty Images The Mind of Donald Trump Dan P. McAdams Narcissism, disagreeableness, grandiosity—a psychologist investigates how Trump’s extraordinary personality might shape his possible presidency. In 2006, Donald Trump made plans to purchase the Menie Estate, near Aberdeen, Scotland, aiming to convert the dunes and grassland into a luxury golf resort. He and the estate’s owner, Tom Griffin, sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock & Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator, reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But, as Michael D’Antonio writes in his recent biography of Trump, Never Enough, Griffin’s most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. “It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump,” Griffin observed. There was something unreal about it. Continue Reading Mike Segar/Reuters Will Mike Pence Be Trump’s Bridge to Democrats? Alex Wagner Indiana Democrats weigh in on their experience with the former governor. Though he has not yet been installed in the Oval Office, Donald Trump has already made life fairly complex for his Republican brethren in Congress. Most recently, in an interview with the New York Times this week, Trump singlehandedly threw the GOP’s Obamacare repeal process into chaos, insisting that a repeal vote would come “probably some time next week” and a replacement “very quickly or simultaneously, very shortly thereafter.” Neither was correct, but especially the replacement timeline: Congressional Republicans  are quietly insisting that it will be weeks before a replacement bill is ready—maybe even months (or years!).   The only person in the administration who seemed willing to acknowledge this reality is Vice President-elect Mike Pence.  In a press conference earlier this month, following a meeting with Republican lawmakers, Pence said: “The architecture of the replacement of Obamacare will come together, as it should, through the legislative process in the weeks and months ahead.” Continue Reading Paul Windle Machiavelli Was Right Michael Ignatieff The shocking lesson of The Prince isn’t that politics demands dirty hands, but that politicians shouldn’t care. You remember the photograph: President Obama hunched in a corner of the Situation Room with his national-security staff, including Hillary Clinton with a hand over her mouth, watching the live feed from the compound in Pakistan where the killing of Osama bin Laden is under way. This is a Machiavellian moment: a political leader taking the ultimate risks that go with the exercise of power, now awaiting the judgment of fate. He knows that if the mission fails, his presidency is over, while if it succeeds, no one should ever again question his willingness to risk all. It’s a Machiavellian moment in a second sense: an instance when public necessity requires actions that private ethics and religious values might condemn as unjust and immoral. We call these moments Machiavellian because it was Niccolò Machiavelli’s The Prince, written in 1513, that first laid bare the moral world of politics and the gulf between private conscience and the demands of public action. Continue Reading Morgan Heim / Day’s Edge Production The Hermit Who Inadvertently Shaped Climate-Change Science J. Weston Phippen Billy Barr moved to the Rocky Mountains four decades ago, got bored one winter, and decided to keep a notebook that has become the stuff of legend. It was a year into his life alone in Colorado’s Rocky Mountains when Billy Barr began his recordings. It started as a curiosity, a task to busy his mind during the winter. By no means, Barr told me, having skied down from his cabin to use the nearest phone, did he set out to make a vital database for climate change scientists. “Hell no!” he said. “I didn’t know anything about climate change at the time.” In 1973 Barr had dropped out of college and made his home an abandoned mining shack at the base of Gothic Mountain, a 12,600-foot stone buttress. The cold winds blew through the shack’s wood slat walls as if they didn’t exist; he shared the bare dirt floor with a skunk and pine marten, his only regular company for much of the year. Barr had moved from the East Coast to the Rocky Mountains precisely because of the solitude, but he couldn’t escape boredom. Especially that first winter. So he measured snow levels, animal tracks, and in spring the first jubilant calls of birds returning. He filled a notebook with these observations; then another notebook. This has continued now for 44 years.

Money makes people anxious—perhaps even more so with writers. The relationship between commerce and writing is commonly sketched out in caricatures: the starving artist, the hapless student, the privileged few who “make it.” More often, it’s not addressed at all. In the past few years, some writers have begun to more openly approach questions of class. The internet has seen a profusion of such pieces: A writer who is “sponsored” by her husband calls on other writers to be more transparent about where their money comes from. Another outlines the clear advantages that being born rich, connected, and able to attend expensive schools furnishes to becoming a successful writer. In another case, a woman who wrote a well-received debut novel details how she went broke after a single advance.

Lord Wolfson, who has to run a business, doesn't have the luxury of looking through rose tinted spectacles James Moore @JimMooreJourno Wednesday 4 January 2017 11:51 BST Click to follow The Independent Online Lord Wolfson: this year may be the toughest since 2008 PA Faced with the growing weight of evidence that Brexit will be a complete disaster, Brexiteers have taken to shooting messengers for not being sufficiently positive about the future.  Most recently this has led to the early departure of Sir Ivan Rodgers, Britain’s ambassador to the EU, a huge loss to the negotiating team given his experience. It also led to an unwarranted attack on the Office for Budgetary Responsibility over the forecasts it issued alongside the Chancellor’s Autumn Statement because they weren't sufficiently sunny.  Read more Next sends shares of UK retailers diving as 2017 outlook turns bleak Brexit political correctness demands that people say it’s great, and presents a marvellous opportunity for the UK regardless of all evidence to the contrary. So you might have expected Brexit backing Next chief executive Lord Wolfson to pen an upbeat assessment of the business's prospects.  Except that he hasn't. Here’s the Next view of what Britain's economy is facing, and the impact it might have on the retailer’s performance: “We may see a further squeeze in general spending as inflation begins to erode real earnings growth.” If you want that translated, Next expects most of us to get poorer.  Then there’s this: “Following the devaluation of the Pound we expect prices on like-for-like garments to rise, but by no more than 5 per cent. We expect that this will depress sales revenue by around 0.5 per cent.” Translation: We’re going to put our prices up, but that means we’ll sell less clobber.  And there’s more: “In the light of the exceptional levels of uncertainty in the clothing sector, and with little visibility of the approach the UK government will be taking to Brexit, we have reviewed our approach to the distribution of surplus cash.” Read more Next sends shares of UK retailers diving as outlook turns bleak Next warns prices could rise by 5% in 2017 Marks & Spencer could become the next Sports Direct Translation: We don’t have a clue what’s going to happen, but we’re very worried and it might have an impact on what we can pay to shareholders. Next thinks that it will generate cash “at the lower end of our guidance” but will use it to pay out a bunch of special dividends so shareholders don’t suffer as much as consumers. There is, however, a caveat: “This plan is subject to the outlook remaining in line with our forecast ranges and no significant changes to market conditions.” Translation: Don’t rely too heavily on our ability to keep this up.  Part of Next’s problem is that under Lord Wolfson, who is, despite it all, a very skilful CEO, it has grown like a train. Growing businesses always stumble at some point not least because growth gets progressively harder to achieve as you get bigger. Next seems to have reached that point The final three months of last year weren’t terribly cheerful and the company had expected a rebound. Instead sales fell by 0.4 per cent. They had fallen by 3.5 per cent during the third quarter of the year, and the end of season sale hasn’t gone too well either.  In a normal environment the business could not, however, be said to be facing insurmountable problems. Far from it. The online business has done better than than the stores, and Next gives every impression of being a well run operation.

There’s Brexit. And, by the look of Next's statement, it appears that Lord Wolfson isn’t as optimistic about that as some of his Brexiteer mates seem to think people should be.  Perhaps that is because, as the boss of a large business, he has to deal with reality. He is also required by law to give a true and fair picture of how the business is going, not to mention by his shareholders, who would boot him out if he didn’t.  The pity is that the Government charged with running Great Britain plc seems incapable of doing the same, and is instead bent on shooting messengers all over the place. There will be more gloomy updates from Next if that continues. And it won’t just be Next either.  More about: Brexit Brexiteers Next Lord Wolfson Sir Ivan Rogers Reuse content Comments Most Popular Video Sponsored Features Follow us: User Policies Privacy Policy Cookie Policy Code of Conduct Complaint Form Contact Us Contributors All Topics Archive Newsletters Jobs Subscriptions Advertising Guide Syndication Evening Standard Novaya Gazeta Install our Apps Close We've noticed that you are using an ad blocker.

The new recruits will join the German company’s various carriers in 2017. The bulk of the cabin crew, around 1,400, will be assigned at the hubs in Frankfurt and Munich alone. With 37,000 employees, Lufthansa, which operates a number of flights from the UAE and the rest of the Middle East, is the largest employer in Frankfurt and Hesse. It is not clear whether some of the positions will be available to candidates in the region. However, US planemaker Boeing had earlier said that airlines in the UAE and the rest of the Middle East region are expected to hire 200,000 more employees to support the growing demand for new aircraft over the next two decades. UAE-based Etihad Airways, which earlier announced some job cuts, are looking for new staff as well. The airline has scheduled at least eight cabin crew assessment days so far this year. Two of these were scheduled to take place in Abu Dhabi today, January 4 and on January 16.  Other locations include Tunisia, Johannesburg, Athens, Paris, Madrid and Cairo. Last year, in addition to the conventional application processes, Lufthansa also held six flight attendant castings in Heidelberg, Mainz, Augsburg, Regensburg, Munich and Berlin, which was met with great interest among the target group. “More than 2,000 applicants went to the castings, and almost 6,000 attended the regular application days in Frankfurt,” the airline said in a statement obtained by Gulf News. The recruitment campaign resulted in the hiring of one in every three applicants. Other divisions of the airline are also hiring. Lufthansa Technik, for example, intends to hire 450 new staff at different locations, while Austrian Airlines is hiring more than 300 additional cabin, check-in and cockpit staff, while other divisions are also looking. Last year, more than 100,000 applications were submitted to the career portal at www.be-lufthansa.com. “This makes us very proud. We are pleased to hire 2 / 2 more than 3000 staff again this year,” said Carsten Spohr, chairman of the board of Deutsche Lufthansa AG.  More from Employment How to get a job in UAE without leaving home DBWC launches partnership with United Nations This airline will hire 3,000 new staff Job loss in UAE: How much you will get paid UAE starts monitoring private Emiratisation Revealed: UAE sectors hiring today UAE sectors where job hiring is increasing UAE jobs: Apple hiring new employees tags from this storyUnited Arab Emirates follow this tag on MGNDubai follow this tag on MGNGermany follow this tag on MGN filed underGulfNewsBusinessSectorsEmployment tagsUnited Arab Emirates follow this tag on MGN+ MGNDubai follow this tag on MGN+ MGNGermany follow this tag on MGN+ MGN FOLLOW US Most Popular ViewedCommentedVideosPictures 01Hiring trends: Hot jobs in UAE in 2017 02UAE jobs: Hiring to pick up in 2017 03This airline will hire 3,000 new staff Play Emirates opens SkyPharma in Dubai Sep 18, 2016 Play Britain is open for business Sep 20, 2016 Play Emirati who created 2 successful companies Jan 02, 2016 Play Tour of the DWTC kitchens May 18, 2015 8Images World Future Energy Summit in Abu Dhabi Jan 18, 2010 8Images Where to live in Downtown Dubai Mar 15, 2011 11Images Etihad Airways offers residence in the sky May 04, 2014 10Images Apple unveils Nike+ smartwatch Oct 29, 2016 EDITOR'S CHOICE Funding UAE health care sector Manoj Nair Huge gap exists in available hospital bed capacity and what is actually needed Find a Job AccountingArchitecture & DesignArts & EntertainmentAuto IndustryAviationBanking & FinanceBeauty, Health & FitnessBiotechnology & ScienceCustomer ServiceDomesticDrivingEngineering & ConstructionHRHospitalityITInsuranceLegalLogisticsManagerialManufacturing & ProductionMarketing & PRMediaMedicalMiscellaneousOil & GasPurchasing & ProcurementReal Estate & Property ServicesRetail & WholesaleSales & Business DevelopmentSecretarialTeachingTechnical & SkilledTravel  testlink-id FEATURED JOBS   Most Popular on Gulf News Speeding driver crashes into parked car, dies Revealed: World's most powerful passports 9 ways your own home could kill you Mum reunited with abused baby in Saudi Arabia Dubai retail developers prepare for mega year Businessman donates Dh370m to charity Mohammad Bin Zayed visits UAE ambassador Revealed: Top 25 universities in the world Female Indonesian workers come to UAE Close Recommended For You Mansour and Saif visit injured diplomatsPUBLISHED ON Jan 15, 2017 Mohammad receives President of MontenegroPUBLISHED ON Jan 15, 2017 9 ways your own home could kill youPUBLISHED ON Jan 11, 2017 Feedback Get The Paper Our Apps Mobile friendly version Our location Advanced Search Sitemap MY GULF NEWS GulfNews.com is the most widely read newspaper, and online site in English in the Middle East.

News Business Business Comment Fatcat Day will fall on New Year's Day in the absence of reform Theresa May promised a City shake up but has subsequently backtracked, and CEO pay looks set to continue its unchecked rise James Moore @JimMooreJourno Wednesday 4 January 2017 10:58 BST Click to follow The Independent Online Bosses will rake in a median salary of £28,200 by midday, according to the High Pay Centre Getty How long will it take before the average CEO earns in a day what the average worker earns in a year, when what the High Pay Centre has designated as Fatcat Day becomes New Year’s Day? Right now, 4 January is Fatcat Wednesday, at which point a typical FTSE boss will have made £28,200. That is what the usual worker will make through the whole of 2017.  Read more 2016 was the year that the volcano of inequality exploded The Centre has been conducting this exercise for a number of years now, to highlight the yawning, and growing, gap between the money made by those at the top when compared to the money made by the people they employ.  It’s an important issue because Britain is becoming an increasingly unequal society and unequal societies are unstable societies. Unstable societies throw up bad things. The Brexit vote and the anger that accompanied it arguably being one of them. And that might be just the start of it.  The typical Briton feels the system is tilted against them, and watches aghast as their own take home remains static while that of the boss soars. What makes it worse is that there is nothing to logically justify the relentless rise in CEO pay. As the Centre points out in its release, research from Lancaster University Management School has revealed that the link between pay and performance is negligible.  Read more May’s great crusade against big business fat-cats has fallen short Theresa May signals new crackdown on fat-cat pay and corporate tax Crackdown on fatcats that isn’t as tough as it seems Bonuses are paid year in year out, with little apparent reference being made to company performance, and remuneration companies shower free shares on their executive charges like so much confetti via complex and woolly “long term incentive” schemes that aren’t very long term but have played a key role in the rapid rise in bosses' awards.  Blah blah blah, executive talent, blah, blah, blah, hire the best people. What, you mean talent like Philip Clarke at Tesco? Or even Marc Bolland at M&S, who led the shares up to the top of the hill and then right back down again? Or large parts of the banking industry a few years ago? I could go on.  Remuneration committees that pay people like these, and others, are typically made up of former executives, private equity types and accountants, who have all benefited from a crooked system and have little incentive to change it.  They are advised by consultants, whose first interest is in retaining business. They also have scant interest in rocking the boat.  Big shareholders do occasionally make a mild fuss, about the really outrageous awards. But here’s the thing: institutional fund managers that actively manage portfolios for investors are also very well paid with little apparent link to performance. Rare is the actively managed fund that can say it has beaten the relevant stockmarket index over the long term, and after charges have been taken into account.  So it’s not in their interest to make too much of a fuss either, otherwise people might start raising uncomfortable questions about their own bonuses.  But fear not! We’ve got Theresa May on our side, haven’t we? A tough as nails PM with the gumption to break it up, and restore some sanity to the City?  Tapping into the widespread anger against “elites”, Ms May initially indicated that she would do this, promising a corporate revolution that would lead to a Britain that works for everyone not just the few. We were going to see workers on boards, a requirement on companies to publish pay ratios, binding votes on pay, and more besides.  But, in the face of a fierce backlash, Ms May has been backtracking faster than Usain Bolt with a rocket pack on his back.  The green paper on corporate governance reform that has emerged has already proven to be a bit of a damp squib. And remember, it’s a green paper. A discussion document that will inevitably be further revised (read watered down).  The City's unhappiness over “Brexit means Brexit” pales by comparison to what it feels about politicians who threaten to take its top people’s sweeties away.  Biggest business scandals in pictures 18 show all Biggest business scandals in pictures 1/18 Former Reckitt Benckiser executive linked to death of 100 people in South Korea jailed for seven years - Friday January 6 A former South Korean executive of UK-based Reckitt Benckiser has been jailed for seven years over the sale of a humidifier disinfectant that killed about 100 people and left hundreds with permanent lung damage. Shin Hyun-woo, head of Reckitt Benkiser’s Oxy subsidiary from 1991 to 2005, was found guilty of accidental homicide and falsely advertising the deadly product as being safe even for children. The consumer product disaster affected many families in South Korea, where children and pregnant women often battle dry winter seasons with humidifiers. Other retailers such as Lotte Mart and Homeplus were also found guilty of selling the deadly product. 2/18 Rogue trader A French court cut the damages owed by rogue trader Jerome Kerviel from €4.9bn (£4.2bn) to just €1m (£860,000). The court ruled on that Kerviel was “partly responsible” for massive losses suffered in 2008 by his former employer Societe Generale through his reckless trades. Kerviel has consistently maintained that bosses at the French bank knew what he was doing all along. AP 3/18 Lloyds chief apologises for damage caused by affair allegations - August 2016 Antonio Horta-Osorio, the chief executive of Lloyds Bank, has broken his silence over allegations about his private life admitting he regrets any "damage done to the group's reputation". In a message sent to the bank's 75,000 employees, the banker said that anyone can make mistakes while insisting that staff had to maintain the highest professional standards. Getty 4/18 Christine Lagarde faces court over £340m Bernard Tapie payment - July 2016 The head of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Christine Lagarde, must stand trial in France over a payment of €403 million (now £340m, then £290m) to tycoon Bernard Tapie, a France's highest appeals court has ruled. The court rejected Ms Lagarde's appeal against a judge's order in December for her to stand trial over allegations of negligence in her handling of the affair. Ms Lagarde could risk a maximum penalty of one year in prison and a fine of €15,000 euros if convicted. Reuters 5/18 HSBC senior manager arrested in FX rigging investigation at JFK airport in New York - July 2016 A senior executive at HSBC has been arrested at New York's JFK airport for his alleged involvement in a conspiracy to rig currency benchmarks, according to reports. Mark Johnson, global head of foreign exchange cash trading in London, was reportedly arrested on Tuesday. He will appear before a federal court in Brooklyn on Wednesday charged with conspiracy to commit wire fraud, Bloomberg said. Getty 6/18 Former PwC employees found guilty in 'Luxleaks' tax scandal - June 2016 Two ex- PricewaterhouseCoopers staffers were found guilty in Luxembourg of stealing confidential tax files that helped unleash a global scandal over generous fiscal deals for hundreds of international companies. Antoine Deltour and Raphael Halet face suspended sentences of 12 months and 9 months and were ordered to pay fines of €1,500 (£1,230) and €1,000 (£822) for their role in the so-called LuxLeaks scandal. Despite the minimal sentences, the ruling was described by Deltour’s lawyer as “shocking” and “a terrible anomaly.” The ruling “puts on guard future whistle-blowers,” Deltour told reporters.The LuxLeaks revelations sped beyond Luxembourg, causing European Union regulators to expand a tax-subsidy probe and propose new laws to fight corporate tax dodging, while EU lawmakers created a special committee to probe fiscal deals across the 28-nation bloc. reuters 7/18 Goldman Sachs dealmakers lavished Libyan officials with prostitutes to win contract - June 2016 A former Goldman Sachs dealmaker trying to persuade Gadaffi-era Libya to invest $1 billion with the investment bank procured prostitutes and invited Libyan officials to lavish parties in the hope of winning the business, the High Court heard on Monday June 13.The Libyan Investment Authority sovereign wealth fund is suing Goldman Sachs for inappropriately coercing its naïve staff into giving its sovereign wealth fund cash to the bank to invest in products they did not understand. The products were designed to generate big profits for Goldman, the LIA claims.Goldman denies wrongdoing and says the LIA was treated as an arms-length customer Reuters 8/18 Former boss of BHS said his life was threatened - June 2016 Darren Topp, the former boss of BHS, has said former owner Dominic Chappell threatened to kill him when he challenged him over a £1.5 million transfer out of the business. MPs on the Business, Innovation and Skills Committee asked Mr Topp about a £1.5 million transfer Mr Chappell made from BHS to a company called BHS Sweden. 9/18 Sports Direct founder Mike Ashley admits paying workers below the minimum wage - June 2016 Mike Ashley admitted paying Sports Direct employees below the minimum wage at a hearing in front of MPs. The company founder said that workers were paid less than the statutory minimum because of bottlenecks at security in an admission that could result in sanctions from HMRC. Reuters 10/18 Mitsubishi admits ‘improper’ fuel tests - April 2016 Mitsubishi has admitted to using false fuel methods dating back to 1991. The scale of the scandal is only just coming to light after it was revealed in April that data was falsified in the testing of four types of cars, including two Nissan cars. AP 11/18 Panama Papers: Millions of leaked documents expose how world’s rich and powerful hid money - April 2016 Millions of confidential documents have been leaked from one of the world’s most secretive law firms, exposing how the rich and powerful have hidden their money. Dictators and other heads of state have been accused of laundering money, avoiding sanctions and evading tax, according to the unprecedented cache of papers that show the inner workings of the law firm Mossack Fonseca, which is based in Panama. 12/18 Google's tax avoidance Google reached a deal with the HM Revenue and Customs to pay back £130 million in so-called “back-taxes” that have been due since 2005. George Osborne championed the deal as a “major success”. But European MEPs have since called for the Chancellor to appear in front of the committee on tax rulings to explain the tax deal. 13/18 Turing Pharmaceuticals and Martin Shkreli Martin Shkreli became known as the “most hated man in the world” after his drug company, Turing, increased the price of a 62-year-old drug that treated HIV patients by 5,000% to $750 a pill. He was charged with illegally taking stock from Retrophin, a biotechnology firm he started in 2011, and using it pay off debts from unrelated business dealings. Shkreli, who maintains he is innocent, and says there is little evidence of fraud because his investors didn't lose money. 14/18 Volkswagen emissions scandal VW admitted to rigging its US emission tests so that diesel-powered cars would looks like they were emitting less nitrous oxide, which can damage the ozone layer and contribute to respiratory diseases. Around 11 million cars worldwide were affected. 15/18 Quindell, the scandal-ridden insurance firm Quindell was once a darling of AIM but its share price fell in April 2014 when its accounting practices were attacked in a stinging research note by US short seller Gotham City. In August the group was forced to disclose that the £107 million pre-tax profit it had reported for 2013 was incorrect, and it had in fact suffered a £64million loss. 16/18 Toshiba Accounting Scandal The boss of Toshiba, the Japanese technology giant, resigned in disgrace in the wake of one of the country’s biggest ever accounting scandals. His exit came two months after the company revealed that it was investigating accounting irregularities. An independent investigatory panel said that Toshiba’s management had inflated its reported profits by up to 152 billion yen (£780m) between 2008 and 2014. 17/18 FIFA Corruption Scandal Fifa, football's world governing body, has been engulfed by claims of widespread corruption since the summer of 2015, when the US Department of Justice indicted several top executives. It has now claimed the careers of two of the most powerful men in football, Fifa President Sepp Blatter and Uefa President Michel Platini, after they were banned for eight years from all football-related activities by Fifa's ethics committee. A Swiss criminal investigation into the pair is ongoing. Getty Images 18/18 Libor fraudster City trader Tom Hayes, 35, has become the first person to be convicted of rigging Libor rates following a trial at London's Southwark Crown Court. Hayes worked as a trader in yen derivatives at UBS before joining the American bank Citigroup in Tokyo. He was fired from Citigroup following an investigation into his trading methods. He returned to the UK in December 2012 and was arrested following a two-and-a-half year criminal investigation by the SFO. Getty Images What we’ll end up with when the green paper becomes a white paper is a little tinkering around the edges of a framework that has allowed the current boom in bosses pay to continue unchecked. The median average of FTSE chief executives’ pay used by the Centre, has the effect of filtering out the really enormous packages at the very top. Were Sir Martin Sorrell’s £70m included in a calculation of the mean average, we would be talking about this a day earlier.  For Sir Martin, Fatcat Day is New Year’s Day. It probably won’t be all that long before Fatcat Day is New Year’s Day for the rest too.  More about: Executive pay High Pay Centre Fatcats Reuse content Comments Most Popular Video Sponsored Features Follow us: User Policies Privacy Policy Cookie Policy Code of Conduct Complaint Form Contact Us Contributors All Topics Archive Newsletters Jobs Subscriptions Advertising Guide Syndication Evening Standard Novaya Gazeta Install our Apps Close We've noticed that you are using an ad blocker.

The scheme saw 68 nurses at an old people’s home in Gothenburg have their eight-hour days cut in a bid to improve staff satisfaction, health and patient care.  Preliminary results concluded that it achieved all of these aims, but the city had to employ an extra 17 staff, costing 12m kroner (£1.4m), Bloomberg reported. EU court rules commuting should count as working hours Read more Six-hour days 'make workers happier and more productive' City officials have decided not to make the scheme permanent because of fears costs could spiral out-of-control. “It's associated with higher costs, absolutely,” said Daniel Bernmar, a local left-wing politician who has been a leading advocate of the six-hour working day and is responsible for elderly care.  “It's far too expensive to carry out a general shortening of working hours within a reasonable time frame.” Read more Six-hour days 'make workers happier and more productive' Six-hour working day 'boosts productivity and makes people happier' As Sweden shifts to six-hour work day the countries that work the Sweden introduces six hour work day Despite the setback, Bernmar is still supportive of the principle of decreased work hours. “I personally believe in shorter working hours as a long-term solution,” he said.  “The richer we become, the more we need to take advantage of that wealth in other ways than through a newer car or higher consumption.” While the public sector may have shunned the idea, at least for now, Sweden’s vibrant tech start-up scene may still be open to it. Filimundus, an app developer based in the capital Stockholm, introduced the six-hour day last year. “The eight-hour work day is not as effective as one would think,” the company’s chief executive Linus Feldt told Fast Company in October.

News Business Business News Fat Cat Wednesday: Top executives have already earned the average worker's entire annual salary With pay of more than £1,000 an hour it has taken fewer than three days to out-earn the typical employee - the national living wage is £7.20 Ben Chapman Tuesday 3 January 2017 19:25 BST Click to follow The Independent Online Sir Martin Sorrel says he is worth every penny of his £70m pay packet Getty Senior executives have already made more money in 2017 than the average British worker will earn all year, new research shows. The High Pay Centre has dubbed today "Fat Cat Wednesday", after finding that bosses will rake in the median salary of £28,200 by midday. With average hourly salaries of £1,000 an hour  it has taken less than three days to out-earn the typical worker. Meanwhile the national living wage stands at £7.20 per hour. Read more UK salaries less than they were 12 years ago, official figures reveal The High Pay Centre said it made the “generous assumption” that top bosses work 12 hours a day, most weekends and take fewer than 10 days holiday a year, in order to justify their pay packets. Bosses of FTSE 100 companies took home close to £4 million on average, or 144 times what normal workers in 2015 the report found.  While top executives enjoyed a 10 per cent pay hike in 2015, real average wages have stagnated for more than a decade, figures from the Office of national Statistics show. Read more Link between high executive pay and performance ‘negligible’ Executive pay still rising despite increased shareholder anger Executive pay jumps 10% but none of the highest paid are women Excessive pay in private firms is now setting a bad example in the public and not-for-profit sectors, with controversy over packages for some university vice chancellors, NHS Trust chief executives, council leaders and charity bosses, the report warned. High Pay Centre director Stefan Stern said: “Our new year calculation is not designed to make the return to work harder than it already is. But Fat Cat Wednesday is an important reminder of the continuing problem of the unfair pay gap in the UK.

In early July Mr Osborne said he wanted to push the levy on company profits to 15 per cent as a bold signal to global companies that the UK is still “open for business” despite the vote to leave the EU. In his speech to the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham today, Mr Hammond made no reference to that 15 per cent goal, merely referencing the existing policy for the levy to decline to 17 per cent.

Featured Story U2 tickets selling for whopping 900 euros each DUBLIN, Ireland - With epic rock band, U2 set to perform at a concert in Croke Park in July this year - a flurry of activity has been witnessed around ticket sales already.  Tickets are set to go on sale officially from tomorrow - however, a day before the official sales begin, tickets to watch the band perform live are already being sold and for nothing less than a whopping 900 euros each.  According to reports, fans that subscribed to the band’s official website were granted access to a pre-sale ticket portal last week and industry sources revealed that diehard fans with access to these tickets have chosen to sell them for a profit.  A set of tickets are said to have become available on official and black market websites since last week.  Tickets available currently on websites like Seatwave and Viagogo are being sold at prices higher than face value.  Officially, tickets for the Lower Davin Stand and pitch area of Croke Park have been priced at 76 euros, along with an extra charge of 3.30 euros for agent fees. Meanwhile, those in other parts of the Cusack and Hogan stands carry a value between 110 euros to 186 euros. But on these websites, the prices have been jacked up.   As of Sunday night, Seatwave, that is run by Ticketmaster, had advertised for 650 tickets that were available for sale.  Reports pointed ut that a pair of tickets was sold at 2,070 euros over the weekend and was for the standing section. It included extra charges and was priced at 13 times above face value.  A spokesperson for Ticketmaster defended the sale in a statement that said that Seatwave prices were set by the person selling the tickets and not the company. The spokesperson said, “The thing about Seatwave is that it is a safe and secure market so tickets would be genuine. The ticket prices are set by the seller, which in this instance is not Ticketmaster, but that price may not necessarily be secured by the seller. Ticketmaster is just facilitating the sale."

The President-elect threatened to impose a "big border tax" on the company for making its Chevy Cruze model in Mexico. GM shares slipped 1% in pre-market trading after Mr Trump made the remarks in a tweet - though they later improved and turned 1% higher shortly after Wall Street opened. Mr Trump wrote: "General Motors is sending Mexican-made model of Chevy Cruze to US car dealers tax free across border. "Make in USA or pay big border tax!" GM becomes the latest US industrial giant to feel the brunt of Mr Trump's remarks ahead of his inauguration later this month. Mr Trump has previously taken aim at aerospace manufacturers Lockheed and Boeing over contracts with the US government he has claimed were too expensive. Mr Trump has been critical of car giant Ford in the past over its investments in Mexico. More broadly he has threatened to slap tariffs of 35% on imports of products made by companies that have moved production out of the US, and said he would tear up a major trade agreement with Mexico and Canada. Last month he warned that firms shifting jobs away from America could be "making a very expensive mistake" and  would face "retribution or consequence". Mr Trump has also pledged to lower the corporate tax rate and scale back regulations to create a better climate in the US for business. General Motors brands include the Chevrolet, Cadillac and Buick as well as Germany's Opel and Britain's Vauxhall. GM said that it makes the sedan model of its Chevy Cruze in the US and that all of those sold in the US were made at a plant in Ohio. A hatchback version is made for global markets in Mexico, with a small number sold in the US, it said in a statement. (c) Sky News 2017: Donald Trump threatens General Motors with 'big border tax!'

These include two critical requirements of the military — construction of submarines under project P 75I and manufacturing of a foreign fighter aircraft in India. Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar Tuesday said: “As far as the strategic partnership is concerned, the discussions are at a final stage. There are a few steps which need to be recorded so that the document is not half-cooked.” But top sources in the ministry told The Indian Express that while they are keen on the SP model, serious differences within the ministry is stalling its progress. Sources agreed that certain defence projects are ready to take-off but await finalisation of the policy. At least three critical defence projects await finalisation of the SP model so that they can go into production under the ‘Make in India’ scheme. The Navy’s submarine fleet needs urgent replacements, which shall be provided by submarines constructed under Project 75I, approved by the Defence Acquisition Council (DAC) many months ago. The same is the case with the Naval Utility Helicopters, which also await a decision on the Indian manufacturer. Equally critical is the IAF’s desperate need for another combat aircraft to supplement the 36 Rafale fighters in the medium weight category. Three foreign companies, Boeing, Lockheed Martin and Saab, are in contention for making their fighters — F-16, F-18 and Gripen — in India but have been told by ministry officials that a decision will be taken only after the finalisation of the SP model.© Provided by Indian Express A committee under former DRDO chief V K Aatre submitted its report on the criteria for selecting the private companies, so that the SP model could be a part of the Defence Procurement Procedure (DPP). First proposed in July 2015 by the Dhirendra Singh Committee, the SP model envisaged identifying a private Indian defence firm for assured contracts for all requirements of a particular military platform. It meant that a company like L&T, if selected, would get all the contracts for making submarines in India while Tatas, if chosen, would make all the planes in India for the next 20 years. A committee under former DRDO chief V K Aatre submitted its report on the criteria for selecting the private companies, so that the SP model could be a part of the Defence Procurement Procedure (DPP). When the DPP was issued after much delay in March 2016, the chapter on SP model was missing. Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar thereafter met with representatives of industry groups to arrive at an amicable model, and formed an internal committee in the ministry to finalise the SP model. The Indian Express has learnt that the Department of Defence Production has been the biggest opponent of this model, calling it ab initio flawed and unsuited for implementation in the Indian landscape. The acquisition wing of the ministry wants two or more companies to be selected as strategic partners for each platform, which would allow for price discovery through competitive bidding. The Department of Defence is strongly in favour of the SP model, which it believes is the only way to kick-start defence production in the private sector in India. It is arguing for a model where a single private company is selected and the price then determined on a cost-plus model. Those opposed to the idea argue that even defence public sector units have done away with the cost-plus model, which was seen as a reason for highly inflated costs for indigenously-produced equipment. In the view of the Department of Defence Finance, the total quantum of assured deals being made over the next two decades would bring the SP model into the ambit of big ticket procurement. This would exceed the powers of the ministry which are limited to Rs 1,000 crore. Any such proposal would have to thus go for approval to the Cabinet Committee on Security, which is bound to insist on a competitive process. Besides allegations of impropriety and favouritism that would accompany a selection of a strategic partner, opponents of the SP model also worry about the flurry of legal challenges from losing companies after one of their competitors is selected. So vehement have been the objections raised within the ministry that the SP model was not even taken up for consideration in the last DAC meeting, chaired by Parrikar, on December 21. Parrikar, however, said a meeting on finalising the SP model will be held sometime next week and we can “expect results very soon”.

He wrote on Twitter, “China has been taking out massive amounts of money & wealth from the U.S. in totally one-sided trade, but won’t help with North Korea. Nice!” Trump’s words are alarming, but his claim is groundless. The Boeing Company sees China as a $1 trillion market. Chinese President Xi Jinping toured the company’s commercial airplane factory in Everett, Washington, in September 2016. At the welcome ceremony, President Xi noted Boeing’s cooperation with China and praised the win-win results. The results are backed by solid data. According to a report by Bloomberg, the company has delivered 967 aircraft to China since 2000, worth about $60.2 billion at 2016 prices. The vice chairman of the company said deliveries to China by Boeing support approximately 150,000 American jobs every year. Chinese companies create jobs and fight unemployment in America. Golden Dragon, a Chinese company based in Xinxiang, China, invested nearly $100 million to build a large copper-tube plant in Thomasville City, Alabama, employing about 150 people in one of the poorest regions in America. At the grand opening in May 2014, Alabama Governor Robert Bentley called Golden Dragon a “significant opportunity for the people of Wilcox County.” It was the first manufacturing project in the county in over half a century. If Trump wants to rebuild America, he will be happy to know that Chinese investors are making trade and investment between the two countries a two-way street. According to a report by the Rhodium Group, the U.S. became the largest recipient of China’s outbound foreign direct investment in 2016, with $45.6 billion worth of acquisitions and investments, and direct investment by Chinese in the U.S. economy since 2000 exceeds $100 billion. China is the top market for Apple and GM, and Telsa and other companies are building their brands in China. Companies both big and small understand the importance of China’s huge market, including The Trump Organization. Trump Hotels plans to open 20-30 luxury hotels in China, according to a report by The Washington Post. However, misunderstandings about the China-U.S. relationship persist, even within the President-elect’s small inner circle. Michael Flynn, who will advise Trump on important national security issues, believes China is allied with “radical Islamists.” In his book, The Field of Fight, Flynn makes the argument that China is a member of an “enemy alliance” in a global war against the West. His claim is not based on solid facts, and this type of thinking is dangerous if he advices the next President in this way. Fortunately, most Americans do not share the incoming administration’s fondness for fake news and conspiracy theories about China. In June 2016, Flynn tweeted that he was “now following” China, and asked users to “please send me anything you get on China activities.” The humorous responses show the deep interconnectedness between China and the U.S. Below are some of them: @stanleyfosha tweeted: “Sir, report from the field. Discovered a coded [message] on the label indicating China manufactured this keyboard.” @liguy743 tweeted: “They have a huge population. People in orbit. Lander on Moon. Nukes. Bigly army. Lots of US T-bills,” then added, “Chk CIA factbook for details.” @marvelle tweeted: “We’ve got 4 suspicious Chinese nationals under surveillance in DC,” and included a link to the Smithsonian’s National Zoo’s Panda Cams. @BruceNV tweeted: “They just started non-stop flights to Vegas. Might be the start of the invasion,” then added, “[Can’t] tell if they are staying [at The Trump Organization].” @dtom_dangerzone tweeted: “There is an unusual amount of activity near the Shenzhen area. Lots of technology being made... investigating.” Trump and his inner circle at the White House need to develop a realistic understanding of the China-U.S. relationship. The amusing comments under Flynn’s tweet show that China and the U.S. are in a deep, interconnected relationship; not just economically, but also on cultural and people-to-people exchange fronts. If random Internet users know the reality, Trump and his inner circle should too.

William Brangham follows up on what’s behind this move and others like it. WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The Ford announcement follows moves from several other companies saying they too might keep some jobs in the U.S. that were planned for Mexico or elsewhere. The president-elect has repeatedly tweeted about some of these companies, including Ford, and pressing them to keep jobs in the U.S. Ford said today that it didn’t consult with Mr. Trump on their Michigan decision. Josh Boak has been covering the story for the Associated Press. And he joins me now. So, Josh, bring us up to speed. What did Ford agree to do today? JOSH BOAK, Associated Press: Ford announced that it wasn’t going to build a $1.6 billion plant in Mexico. There were a few reasons for that, one of which was that the plant was going to build Ford Focuses. And sales of that car have dipped as oil prices have fallen. WILLIAM BRANGHAM: This is a little, small, fuel-efficient vehicle. JOSH BOAK: Exactly. But the other major impact has been Donald Trump on Twitter talking about companies and what he wants to see them do, and those two seem to have combined together. Ford’s own CEO said he hoped that Trump’s policies on deregulation and taxes would be good for the company and good for the country. WILLIAM BRANGHAM: As we mentioned before, this follows moves where Trump has targeted other companies, Carrier, Boeing, Lockheed Martin. And companies have shifted their positions based according to what Mr. Trump seems to be saying. Overall, how many jobs are we talking about here that are going to be staying in the U.S.? JOSH BOAK: Well, as far as Ford’s announcement today, they’re looking to hire 700 workers starting in 2018. When we look at Carrier, that’s 800 jobs. When we look last week at Sprint, that’s 5,000 jobs. OneWeb, that’s 3,000 jobs. Now, that sounds like a lot in an individual announcement, but the U.S. economy is massive. It added 2.25 million jobs last year alone. That’s so great, that this is really a drop in the bucket in the big picture. But it’s massive symbolically. We can’t forget that part of economics is psychology and the animal spirits, and Trump is really stirring them right now. WILLIAM BRANGHAM: So, do you credit these moves to Donald Trump? I mean, he would love to take credit for them, and we have seen him do that many times in the past. Do you credit him with what we saw out of Ford today? JOSH BOAK: Well, many of the chief executives involved in these decisions are crediting Donald Trump or attributing their decisions to him. And they have benefited from that. Last week, with the Sprint deal, for example, we saw Masayoshi Son say this has been the result of actions by the Trump administration. And giving credit to Donald Trump has actually been good for these companies. Sprint’s stock is up more than 40 percent, as of last Friday, since Trump became president. So, if the bottom line is what these CEOs really care about, then being on Trump’s side thus far has been profitable. WILLIAM BRANGHAM: So, how much of this — getting back to the point you made, how much of this is about economics and how much of this is about politics? Is this about a substantial change in manufacturing policy by these companies, or is this about being on the right side of public opinion? JOSH BOAK: Well, it’s critical to note there actually hasn’t been a policy change, just a series of tweets and public statements and phone calls. We haven’t seen a policy overhaul. We have seen the promise of policy overhauls on regulatory and tax issues, but those haven’t been manifest yet. So what this really appears to be is a president-elect able to exercise power on social media in a way that’s unprecedented. And corporations have seen benefits to responding to that. WILLIAM BRANGHAM: We saw President-elect Trump leaning on GM today. Is this, in your mind, just the new paradigm, that companies in the U.S. have to prepare for the fact that you might have the president-elect or the soon-to-be president just naming them and shaming them? JOSH BOAK: It’s definitely possible. Business leaders I have talked to have said that they expect to have a bullseye on them. But what we have also seen talking with members of the Trump transition team is that Donald Trump sees these actions and interventions as a way to stay connected with his voting base. WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Do you think that these — as you mentioned, this is not necessarily a reflection of a new policy. Like, do you have any sense how Trump might — how this might translate, these actions might translate into a more cohesive economic policy going forward? JOSH BOAK: Well, he ran on the premise of America first. And that was all part of the greater make America great again theme. He’s clearly said that he wants to increase manufacturing jobs. And so this seems to be a component of that. The question is how he goes about that. We don’t have the policy details, although he has suggested that he will impose a border tax of some kind on companies that move jobs overseas. He’s also suggested that he’s going to cut regulation, which increases profits for a lot of these companies. What remains to be seen is whether he can create jobs on a meaningful scale and generate the kind of economic growth that’s he’s actually promised, about 3.5 percent a year. WILLIAM BRANGHAM: It seems to be he has got a carrots-and-sticks policy going here. He’s going to offer them, potentially, less regulations and thus lower taxes, and then also threaten to put this tax on them if they try to leave the country. Do you think that there’s an appetite in Congress to actually put those measures into place? JOSH BOAK: Well, that remains to be seen. What executives like Ford CEO Mark Fields has said when he talks about his decision on Mexico is to say — is to emphasize the taxes and deregulation. He is focusing on the carrots, not the sticks. Business leaders are emphasizing those carrots, which means that they either don’t want to address the sticks or they don’t think the sticks are likely to happen. WILLIAM BRANGHAM: You have obviously been covering economic policy for a long time. How unusual is this, to have a president-elect naming companies by name and singling them — singling them out, and then them responding? JOSH BOAK: It’s unprecedented because he hasn’t assumed office yet. More importantly, he’s doing so on social media and other venues that presidents historically have not had. WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Just because it hasn’t existed. JOSH BOAK: Exactly. WILLIAM BRANGHAM: All right, Josh Boak, AP, thank you very much for being here. JOSH BOAK: Thank you.

(U.S. Marine Corps photo/Thor Larson) Posted By: Richard Sisk January 3, 2017 Retired Marine Gen. James Mattis — Donald Trump’s choice for defense secretary — backed the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter jet program recently criticized by the president-elect, according to a senator who met with Mattis on Tuesday. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat from Connecticut and a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, told the Hartford Courant newspaper that Mattis gave a “clear commitment” to the continuation of the F-35 program despite Trump’s repeated criticism of its huge costs and questionable performance thus far. In an earlier statement, Blumenthal said of his meeting with Mattis, “I was encouraged by his clear commitment to American air superiority and the important role of the F-35 program in sustaining and enhancing it.” United Technologies Corp., which has headquarters in Hartford, supplies the engines for the Lockheed Martin Corp.-made F-35 and thousands of jobs in Connecticut are dependent on continuation of the program. Trump last month said the costs of the F-35 program, projected at more than $400 billion for development and procurement of nearly 2,500 aircraft, were “out of control” and suggested that he may consider replacing it with a version of the F-18E/F Super Hornet made by competitor Boeing Co. Lockheed Chief Executive Officer Marillyn Hewson met with Trump before Christmas and pledged to revamp the program. “I’ve heard his message loud and clear about reducing the cost of the F-35,” she said in a statement. “I gave him my personal commitment to drive the cost down aggressively.” Mattis has a reputation for independence and his backing of the F-35 would not be the first time that his judgment has been at odds with Trump’s. In lavishing praise on Mattis during the announcement of his choice of defense secretary, Trump said it was a revelation to him when Mattis rejected the use of so-called “enhanced interrogation techniques” on suspected terrorists. Trump said Mattis told him that he could get more out a prisoner with “a few beers and a pack of cigarettes” than he could with torture. Mattis met with Blumenthal in the course of making the rounds on Capitol Hill to ease his path to getting the waiver that would allow him to serve as defense secretary in the new Trump administration. Mattis, often referred to as “Mad Dog” by Trump, also met with Sen. Jack Reed, a Rhode Island Democrat and ranking member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, and others ahead of the panel’s hearing next week on the required waiver and his qualifications to succeed outgoing Defense Secretary Ashton Carter. Before he can be confirmed by the Senate, Mattis will need special legislation from Congress exempting him from the federal law barring members of the military from serving as defense secretary until seven years after retirement. Mattis retired from the Marine Corps and his last post as head of U.S. Central Command in 2013. Enacted after World War II, the law was aimed at preserving civilian control of the military. The only waiver previously granted was to Gen. George C. Marshall, the Army chief of staff during the last world war. Mattis, a legend in the Marine Corps for his leadership in Iraq and Afghanistan, has widespread support for the nomination but some senators have expressed reservations about granting the waiver. In a statement last month after Trump announced that Mattis was his choice, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, a New York Democrat and member of the defense committee, said, “While I deeply respect Gen. Mattis’ service, I will oppose a waiver. Civilian control of our military is a fundamental principle of American democracy, and I will not vote for an exception to this rule.” In his own statement last month, Reed said, “It is clear that Gen. Mattis is a respected Marine and strategic thinker who served with honor and distinction. What is less clear is how Congress would go about changing the law to allow him or any recently retired senior officer to serve as the head of the Pentagon. That would require ‎a debate about our Constitutional principle of civilian control of the military and passing a new bill.” Previous post Next post About the Author Richard Sisk Richard Sisk is a reporter for Military.com.

Bobby Yip/Reuters/File | Caption Steven Porter Staff | @reporterporter January 3, 2017 —Threatening once again to impose a hefty tariff on foreign-made goods, US President-elect Donald Trump singled out yet another manufacturing company Tuesday via Twitter, criticizing General Motors Co. for making some of its compact cars in Mexico. Since winning the presidential election in November, Mr. Trump has made a habit of targeting big businesses one by one, including United Technologies Inc., Boeing Co., and Lockheed Martin Corp., to name a few. A spokesman for his transition team said these individual critiques reflect a broader goal for the incoming Republican administration to rescue American workers. "In this case, the tweet was specific to General Motors," spokesman Sean Spicer told Reuters. "But I think you've seen an overall philosophy during the campaign and since he was elected to stand up for American workers and make sure that American companies don't benefit from moving their companies overseas and leaving American workers behind." Although not specific, Trump's Tuesday threat was clear: "General Motors is sending Mexican made model of Chevy Cruze to U.S. car dealers-tax free across border," he wrote. "Make in U.S.A. or pay big border tax!" General Motors is sending Mexican made model of Chevy Cruze to U.S. car dealers-tax free across border. Make in U.S.A.or pay big border tax!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 3, 2017 General Motors responded with a statement acknowledging that "a small number" of Cruze hatchbacks are manufactured in Mexico and sold in the United States. The overwhelming majority of Cruze models sold to Americans, however, are sedans – all of which are made in Lordstown, Ohio, the company said. Of the 190,000 Cruze models sold in the US last year, only 4,500 – less than 2.4 percent – were hatchbacks made in Mexico, a GM spokesperson tells The Christian Science Monitor in an email. Although sales were down significantly last year, the Cruze is one of GM's best-selling cars. How much do you know about the auto industry's future? Trump – who has denounced the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) among Mexico, the US, and Canada, which took effect in 1994 – did not specify how he would impose the tariff threatened in his tweet or how severe it would be. But the comment echoes past statements in which he has threatened to impose a 35 percent tax on foreign-made goods sold to Americans by companies that offshore American jobs, an idea economists have said would not work. "Imposing tariffs or putting up trade barriers may sound good, but it will hurt our economy and credibility," Wendy Cutler, a former acting deputy US Trade Representative who helped negotiate the Trans-Pacific Partnership last year, told Reuters in March. And others point out that presidents lack the authority to impose tariffs unilaterally without congressional approval, as CBS Money Watch reported. Hours after Trump's tweet about GM, rival carmaker Ford Motor Co. announced it would cancel plans to built a $1.6-billion factory in Mexico, instead investing $700 million at a factory in Michigan. Shortly before noon, Trump retweeted a link to a Fox News article praising him as "quite the job creator" for putting pressure on Ford and others to keep jobs stateside. "@DanScavino: Ford to scrap Mexico plant, invest in Michigan due to Trump policies"https://t.co/137nUo03Gl— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 3, 2017 GM chief executive Mary Barra is among business leaders who sit on a council unveiled last month to advise Trump on job creation efforts. Detroit's "Big Three" automakers – GM, Ford, and Chrysler – have all sought in recent years to produce more small cars in Mexico for the North American market in an effort to lower labor costs, while having American workers build trucks, sport utility vehicles, and luxury cars, which are more profitable. In 2014, GM announced a $5-billion investment in its Mexican plants, creating 5,600 jobs. In November, GM announced plans to lay off nearly 2,000 employees at two US auto plants in early 2017, including at the facility in Lordstown.

Metro Denver’s housing market developing a split personality, sending rents down and home prices up By Ben Brody and David Welch, Bloomberg News President-elect Donald Trump criticized General Motors for building a version of the Chevrolet Cruze compact in Mexico, saying the largest U.S. automaker should build the car at home or face a hefty tariff. “General Motors is sending Mexican made model of Chevy Cruze to U.S. car dealers-tax free across border,” Trump tweeted Tuesday. “Make in U.S.A. or pay big border tax!” Every Cruze sedan is built in Ohio and most of GM’s Mexican-made hatchbacks are exported to global markets, said Tony Cervone, a company spokesman. He declined to comment on whether the company planned to talk to Trump. Trump’s tweet is the latest example of interventionist behavior toward U.S. companies that have included Boeing, Lockheed Martin and United Technologies. His threats against Mexican-built vehicles have the potential to affect the nine global carmakers, including Toyota and Nissan, that have announced more than $24 billion in Mexico investments since 2010. Volkswagen’s Audi, BMW and Daimler each build or plan to assemble luxury vehicles, engines or heavy trucks in the country. The Trump transition team has said Chief Executive Officer Mary Barra will be among the panel of business leaders giving him strategic advice on the economy after he takes office. The Detroit-based company said in November it planned to cut a shift at its Cruze plant in Ohio and furlough 1,200 workers there due to weak demand for small cars. Glenn Johnson, president of United Auto Workers Local 1112, which represents GM workers in Lordstown, Ohio, said in an interview at the time of the layoffs that he didn’t know if his plant had the tooling in place to make the Cruze hatchback version. The hatchback version sells in small numbers and probably would not rescue an entire shift, he said. Trump has made a point of pressuring large U.S. manufacturers into keeping production in the U.S. He criticized Ford during the presidential campaign for moving production of the Ford Focus compact and C-Max hybrid to Mexico. In November, he said on Twitter he talked with Chairman Bill Ford and got the automaker to commit to keeping production of the Lincoln MKC sport utility vehicle in Kentucky instead of Mexico. At the time, Trump indicated he’d saved the plant. In reality, the plant was not scheduled to close. Its employees assemble the Ford Escape SUV, a better-selling model. More than 5,000 employees work nearly around the clock on three crews to meet demand for the two SUVs.

Who's next? President-elect Donald Trump speaks to workers at Carrier air conditioning and heating on December 1, 2016 in Indianapolis, Indiana. (Photo: Tasos Katopodis, Getty Images) Donald Trump tweets and an auto titan retreats. But it's more complicated than that. It's increasingly a story of an unconventional president-elect who enjoys keeping opponents on edge and a century-old auto industry trying to adjust as quickly and nimbly as possible. Here's what we know so far and what Ford's decision to back off plans to expand in Mexico and invest in Michigan could mean for the auto industry and corporate America in a time of Trump. 1. An incoming president notches another victory after chiding an industrial titan into reversing course.  First Carrier, now Ford. The air-conditioning company originally decided to move many of its Indiana plant jobs to Mexico. But after the election, Carrier reached an agreement with the incoming administration of President-elect Trump to keep nearly 1,000 jobs in the state. Then Ford Executive Chairman Bill Ford told the president-elect that the automaker no longer plans to move production of its Lincoln MKC from Louisville to Mexico. Trump took credit for causing Ford to change its plans in two tweets. Tuesday, after Ford's announcement about the cancellation of its new Mexican plant in favor of a Michigan investment, Trump again touted his role in the move on social media. Who could be next? Well, Trump's Twitter account in recent months has targeted online retailer Amazon, defense contractors Lockheed Martin  and Boeing, department store Macy's, mobile phone carrier T-Mobile and industrial parts maker Rexnord, according to the Associated Press. 2. A Michigan plant once feared slated for closure could be on the leading edge of auto technology Workers surround a 2014 Ford Fusion which ceremoniously was rolled off the line at the Flat Rock Assembly Plant in Flat Rock, Michigan on Thursday, August 29, 2013.  (Photo: Eric Seals) Ford's Flat Rock plant, formerly shared in a joint venture with Mazda that ended in 2012, has produced exclusively Ford vehicles since then. The plant now builds two Ford icons: the Mustang and Lincoln Continental. More than 3,200 workers are employed at the plant, according to a Ford online fact sheet. The plant's future has been in doubt from time to time in recent years. In 2012, Flat Rock was operating a single shift and was in danger of being closed. It was saved with the decision to add the Ford Fusion to augment the three shifts of production at a plant in Hermosillo, Mexico, that could not keep up with demand. Ford invested $555 million to make Flat Rock flexible enough to make multiple vehicles. A second shift was added in August 2013 to boost Fusion production. But then Fusion production left while Mustang continued and Lincoln Continental production launched. Now the automaker is investing $700 million and adding 700 direct new jobs in the Flat Rock Assembly Plant to create a factory capable of producing high-tech electrified and autonomous vehicles — plus the iconic Mustang and Continental. Ford said an all-new fully electric small SUV, coming by 2020, will be engineered to deliver an estimated range of at least 300 miles. It will be built at the Flat Rock plant and sold in North America, Europe and Asia. The plant is also getting a high-volume autonomous vehicle designed for commercial ride hailing or ride sharing. The hybrid vehicle will debut in 2021, according to Ford. 3. Ford appears to be on a charm campaign for Donald Trump Bill Ford, the executive chairman of Ford Motor Company talks with automotive journalists after the 2017 Ford Raptor and three versions of the 2017 Ford Fusion were revealed during the 2016 North American International Auto Show at Joe Louis Arena in downtown Detroit on Monday, Jan. 11, 2016.  (Photo: Eric Seals) Early on, Ford sounded almost defiant amid criticism by Trump. “We are everything that he should be celebrating about this country," Ford Executive Chairman Bill Ford told reporters in Detroit in September before Trump's Nov. 8 victory. "We pulled ourselves up with our bootstraps. We paid back our borrowings. We are very healthy again. We’ve been adding jobs in the U.S. And we’re the largest manufacturer of cars and trucks in the U.S." Ford, who is Henry Ford's great-grandson, added that "investments we are making in the U.S. are enormous." Trump's "basic premise is wrong. For over 100 years we’ve been in markets all over the world making vehicles. We’ve made vehicles in Mexico for a long time,” Ford said, later disclosing that the auto industry scion and president-elect had met one-on-one in 2016. Less than two months later, the automaker's tone had changed. Last month, Ford Chief Financial Officer Bob Shanks liked many of the pro-growth, pro-business polices that  Trump's incoming administration wants to pursue even though the president-elect has repeatedly threatened to punish the automaker for moving small-car production to Mexico. "I think governing and the campaign are two different things," Shanks told the Free Press. "I am hopeful and optimistic that this change in tone will carry forward into policies that ... will be quite different than the prior administration but will be positive for growth." Shanks said Ford hopes Trump's administration will consider easing greenhouse gas regulations and fuel economy regulations scheduled to take effect between 2020 and 2025. It also hopes for corporate tax reform. Shanks said Ford hopes the Trump administration explores whether "some adjustment that can be made to the present regulatory framework that recognizes the market realities." But that doesn't mean Ford isn't worried about Trump's free-trade polices and potential changes to the North American Free Trade Agreement. "Trade probably is one (area) that we are concerned about," Shanks said. "On trade we will have to see ... I think he is starting to put people around him who know part of that business … and recognize the incredible integration of Mexico and Canada and the United States." Tuesday's Ford announcement again mentioned Trump admiringly. On July 23, 2015, Ford Motor Company President and CEO Mark Fields speaks during a ceremony to mark the opening of contract negotiations with the United Auto Workers in Detroit. Fields said Tuesday, Aug. 16, 2016, that Ford Motor Co. will have a fully autonomous vehicle ready to provide ride-hailing or ride-sharing services by 2021.  (Photo: Paul Sancya, AP) “We look at all the factors and our view is we see a more positive U.S. manufacturing business environment under President-elect Trump and the pro-growth policies and proposals that he is talking about, so this is a vote of confidence for President-elect Trump and some of the policies that they may be pursuing," Ford CEO Mark Fields said. “We informed him and also Vice President-elect (Mike) Pence this morning. They were very pleased that we are investing here in the United States." And it's not like Trump had disliked everything connected to the Blue Oval automaker.  Last month, former Ford President and CEO Alan Mulally met with Trump to talk about the Secretary of State post that eventually went to Exxon's CEO. 4. Despite Ford's decision to invest in the U.S. rather than Mexico, the overall industry's investment south of the border is slated to continue. The president for the Americas of Ford Motor Company, Joseph Hinrichs smiles while speaking at Los Pinos presidential palace in Mexico City on April 17, 2015. The Ford Motor Company had announced a $2.5 billion plan to expand factories in Mexico to make next-generation engines and transmissions. Speaking at an event alongside President Enrique Pena Nieto in Mexico's capital, Hinrichs said the projects in the states of Chihuahua and Guanajuato will create 3,800 direct jobs.  (Photo: YURI CORTEZ, AFP/Getty Images) In recent years, General Motors, Honda, Hyundai, Nissan, Mazda, Toyota and Volkswagen have all announced plans to either expand existing plants or build new ones in Mexico. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles also has said it is considering an expansion of its production there. By 2020, Mexico is expected to build one in four vehicles in a North American industry producing 8.6 million units a year. But Trump's election may cause forecasters to revisit their projections. Ford said last month that it decided to continue producing the Lincoln MKC in Kentucky because of "changing business conditions" — not because of threats Trump has made over the past 18 months to impose tariffs on cars made in Mexico. However, Ford does concede that the economic policies the president-elect has proposed helped to tip the scale toward keeping production of the crossover in Kentucky. Unlike Ford, GM has mostly avoided criticism from Trump — until Tuesday — even though it announced plans in December 2014 to invest $5 billion in Mexico through 2018 — a move that would double its production capacity there. GM said in 2014 the investment would create 5,600 jobs in Mexico. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles noted that it has announced $8.4 billion in U.S.-based investments and has added almost 25,000 U.S. jobs since 2009. However, FCA also is moving production of its next-generation Jeep Compass from Belvidere, Ill., to Toluca, Mexico. Even some Michigan Democrats blame the North American Free Trade Agreement — passed under Democratic President Bill Clinton — for moves south of the border that ultimately cost Americans job opportunities. "Our industry has been badly hurt by NAFTA, which has cost us a million jobs across the country," U.S. Rep. Debbie Dingell, D-Dearborn, said Tuesday of the auto industry while joined by AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka to call on Trump to live up to his campaign promises to renegotiate NAFTA. 5. Ford's sizable electrification investment comes as demand for vehicles remains slack From left, LG Group Chairman Koo Bon-moo, Michigan Gov. Jennifer Granholm and LG Chem CEO Peter Bahn-Suk Kim break ground on the new LG Chem plant that will manufacture advanced batteries for Chevrolet and Ford electric cars, Thursday, July 15, 2010, in Holland, Mich.  (Photo: Carlos Osorio, AP) Every automaker likes to talk about electrified vehicles. But reality shows they still sell very few of them. According to the website Inside EVs, there were about 134,000 electric vehicles sold in the U.S. through November. According to Autodata, total U.S. sales through November rose to a seasonally adjusted annual running rate of 17.87 million. Going forward, for example, the future of federal tax credits for buying electric cars and trucks — a key incentive to get consumers into the showroom — is unknown. "The short answer is that we don’t know what will happen with the Trump administration and electric vehicles," Dave Reichmuth, senior engineer for the Union of Concerned Scientists clean vehicles program, told the Free Press in November. "It might be awhile before we understand the policy priorities for the new administration." 2013 Ford C-Max Hybrid: C-MAX Hybrid headlined Ford's transformed lineup, one-third of which will feature a model with 40 mpg or more in 2012.  (Photo: Ford) Still, most car makers are global companies, and China and Europe are moving forward with their incentives for non-gas-burning vehicles. Whatever the Trump administration does, the rest of the world will not likely abandon the Paris Agreement to reduce the global growth of carbon emissions. Ford said Tuesday it's trying to make owning an electrified vehicle easier than ever. Ford touted its memorandum of understanding with several other automakers in Europe to create an ultra-fast charging network projected to be significantly faster than the most powerful charging system deployed today. An initial target of about 400 sites in Europe is planned. By 2020, consumers should have access to thousands of high-powered charging points, according to Ford. Ford also is piloting wireless technology on company EVs in the U.S. and Europe that make recharging as easy as pulling into a parking spot so drivers never forget to recharge. Wireless recharging extends electric-only range for short distance commuters, even during quick stops. The system known as FordPass also can help consumers reserve charging times.

The company's announcement culminated a dizzying morning that started with Trump threatening to punish General Motors for building a version of its fading compact car in Mexico. GM challenged his assertions, but minutes later Ford — a frequent target of Trump's campaign-trail criticism — struck a different note.

More videos Trump puts pressure on US auto industry Ford cancels Mexico factory plans after President-elect Donald Trump assails General Motors and threatens a "big border tax" for producing cars in Mexico. Trump was "very pleased we were making this investment in US jobs," Mark Fields, Ford's chief executive officer, told reporters at the automaker's plant in Flat Rock, Michigan, where it will add 700 positions. "One of the factors we're looking at is the more positive US business environment that we foresee under President-elect Trump and the pro-growth policies that he's been outlining. So this is a vote of confidence around that." However, Mr Fields said the move was primarily a response to a decline in the North American demand for small cars like those that would have been made at the Mexican plant. He said the company would have made the same decision even if Trump had not been elected.

His persistent interventionist campaign has targeted companies including Boeing, Lockheed Martin and United Technologies, singling out those whose job moves or prices have rankled him. While many analysts doubt the long-term efficacy of his approach, short-term gains, like Tuesday's, can be had. Michigan's Man The auto industry has been a special prize for Trump, conjuring visions of a thriving, 1950s-era Detroit where shift work created jobs that paid for mortgages, college educations and an annual vacation. His feud with the auto industry emerged during the campaign. He appeared eight times in Michigan, driving home a message that he would cancel the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement, which he blamed for sending auto-factory jobs to Mexico. Trump was the first Republican presidential candidate to win the state since George H.W. Bush in 1988. Advertisement General Motors is sending Mexican made model of Chevy Cruze to U.S. car dealers-tax free across border. Make in U.S.A.or pay big border tax!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 3, 2017 Companies aside from Ford may find it more advantageous to work with Trump rather than to battle his unprecedented social-media reach and willingness to get involved in individual deals. "You're just setting yourself up to lose," said Joe Watkins, a Pennsylvania-based Republican consultant and former aide to President George H.W. Bush. "He can continue to keep you front and centre in the news just with a single tweet, so why do you want to engage in a fight?" The news sent Ford shares up 3.2 per cent to $12.52 and GM shares rose 0.6 per cent to $35 at 2:10 p.m. in New York. The Mexican peso, meanwhile, weakened beyond 21 to the dollar as Ford's announcement sparked concern that Trump is succeeding in curtailing investment in the country. Earlier in the day, Trump trained his sights on GM. Trump said in a Twitter post that the largest US automaker, which manufactures a Chevrolet Cruze hatchback model in San Luis Potosi, should build the car at home or face a hefty tariff. "General Motors is sending Mexican made model of Chevy Cruze to US car dealers-tax free across border," Trump tweeted. "Make in USA. or pay big border tax!" That barb elicited a terse response from GM spokesman Tony Cervone challenging his assertions: "General Motors manufactures the Chevrolet Cruze sedan in Lordstown, Ohio. All Chevrolet Cruze sedans sold in the US are built in GM's assembly plant in Lordstown, Ohio. GM builds the Chevrolet Cruze hatchback for global markets in Mexico, with a small number sold in the US." Instead of driving jobs and wealth away, AMERICA will become the world's great magnet for INNOVATION & JOB CREATION.https://t.co/siXrptsOrt— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 3, 2017 The automaker has sold only 4500 hatchbacks north of the border, said another spokesman, Jim Cain. The 190,000 Cruze sedans that Americans have bought were all built in Lordstown, according to Cervone. Cervone declined to say whether the company would engage further with Trump. There is no tariff on cars built in Mexico and shipped over the border for sale in the US Mexico's government has courted car companies around the world by entering into 13 free-trade agreements with 44 countries that make up 60 per cent of the global gross domestic product. The country has tariff-free access to 47 per cent of the worldwide vehicle market, compared with 9 per cent for the US Mexican autoworkers earn less than $6 an hour on average, with a minimum wage of $4.50, according to the Center for Automotive Research. Their United Auto Workers union peers average $28 an hour. President-Elect's Pressure Nine global carmakers, including Toyota and Nissan, have announced more than $24 billion in Mexico investments since 2010. Volkswagen AG's Audi, BMW AG and Daimler AG each build or plan to assemble luxury vehicles, engines or heavy trucks in the country. Trump has made a point of pressuring large US manufacturers into keeping production in the US. He criticised Ford during the presidential campaign for moving manufacturing of the Ford Focus compact and C-Max hybrid to Mexico. In November, he said on Twitter that he talked with Chairman Bill Ford and got the automaker to commit to keeping production of the Lincoln MKC sport utility vehicle in Kentucky instead of Mexico. At the time, Trump indicated he'd saved the plant. In reality, the plant wasn't scheduled to close. Its employees assemble the Ford Escape SUV, a better-selling model. More than 5,000 employees work almost around the clock on three crews to meet demand for the two SUVs. Fields expressed skepticism that Trump would slap a 35 per cent tariff on the Focus, which will still be built in Mexico. "The right policies will prevail because we share the same aspirations that I think the president-elect does — we want a very strong US economy," Fields said. "The president elect has run on many of these stances and he seems to be a man of his word." Bloomberg, Reuters Advertisement HuffPost Australia Man Spends 30 Hours Disputing False ...

Finance Search Automakers in headlights as Trump set to take the wheelBy John BIERS | AFP – Tue, Jan 3, 2017 10:52 PM AEDT Related Content View Photo Ford is adding 700 US jobs and investing $700 million during the next four years to expand its Flat Rock Assembly Plant in Michigan US automakers found themselves in the political hot seat Tuesday, with President-elect Donald Trump lambasting GM for importing Mexican-made cars into the United States and Ford scrapping plans for a new plant south of the border. Trump, who won the presidency in part with tough talk on trade, has shown his willingness to single out individual companies by name if they displease him, and Ford seems to be the latest to fall in line. Also on Tuesday, Trump nominated Reagan-era protectionist lawyer Robert Lighthizer to serve as US trade representative, signaling he intends to make good on pledges to renegotiate trade deals he blames for killing millions of American jobs. The moves likely will loom large over next week's Detroit auto show, when the US industry's top executives gather to show off their new models. The president-elect, who has previously taken to Twitter to slam Boeing and Lockheed Martin, made GM his latest target in a breakfast-hour tweet threatening to impose tariff on imports of a small number of Mexican-made Chevy Cruze models into the US. - About-face at Ford - A couple of hours later, Ford announced it was scuttling plans for a new $1.6 billion factory in San Luis Potosi, and instead invest $700 million over the next four years to expand its Flat Rock Assembly Plant in Michigan to build electric and self-driving vehicles. The Ford decision was an about-face after the second-biggest US automaker repeatedly rebuffed Trump's criticism over its plans for the Mexico plant during and after the presidential campaign. Ford chief executive Mark Fields said the decision reflected the hope that Trump's policies will boost the US manufacturing environment. "It's literally a vote of confidence around some of the pro-growth policies that he has been outlining and that's why we're making this decision to invest here in the US and our plant here in Michigan," Fields told CNN. He said company chairman Bill Ford spoke Tuesday morning to Trump, and that he himself had spoken to Vice-President-elect Pence about the move, which Ford said would result in 700 new US jobs over four years. The new plant, announced in April, was expected to employ 2,800 by 2020. Mexico's government said it "regrets" Ford's decision, and that the company gave assurances it would repay "any expenditures made by the state government to facilitate this investment." - Another win for Trump? - Trump took to Twitter again to crow about the Ford reversal: "Instead of driving jobs and wealth away, AMERICA will become the world's great magnet for INNOVATION & JOB CREATION." Ford's decision creates a "political headline win for Trump, Ford and the UAW," yet the diminished demand for small cars also makes it a positive decision in terms of business rationale, investment bank RBC Capital Markets said in a note. Meanwhile, GM responded to Trump's Twitter attack with a statement emphasizing that the vast majority of its Cruze cars sold in the US are made in Ohio, with just a small percentage imported from a plant across the southern border. "All Chevrolet Cruze sedans sold in the US are built in GM's assembly plant in Lordstown, Ohio," the auto giant said. Of 190,000 Cruze cars sold in the US, only 4,500 were hatchbacks made in Mexico, said a GM spokesman. - Trade war coming? - Tough talk on trade helped Trump win election, and on the campaign trail he threatened to impose a 35 percent import duty on cars produced in Mexico. He has also pledged to tear up the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico, blaming NAFTA and other trade agreements for the loss of millions of American manufacturing jobs. The appointment of Lighthizer as his top trade negotiator suggests Trump plans to follow through on that rhetoric. Lighthizer served as deputy US trade representative in the Ronald Reagan administration in the 1980s, when the focus was on attacking Japan for its huge exports into the US market. But leading business lobbies such as the Business Roundtable have cautioned that US trading partners could retaliate against any new tariffs, threatening key US markets. "Any significant tariff increase within the North American region would impact the auto industry greatly and that just really makes the industry... much less competitive," said Christopher Wilson, deputy director of Mexico Institute at the Wilson Center, a Washington think tank. Automakers are also worried that Trump's tough rhetoric towards China could trigger a full-scale trade war if the Republican makes good on threats to impose punitive tariffs on Beijing.

That is, jawboning by exerting rhetorical bombast focused on people, corporations and institutions, with massive media propulsion behind the very personal presidency he will establish. It will be a natural daily extension of his boundless, easily bruisable ego. Trump has embraced these tactics as both a candidate and president-elect. He went after Carrier Corp. (a subsidiary of United Technologies) and Ford Motor Co. for shipping jobs to Mexico, after Boeing for charging too much for the new Air Force One and after Lockheed/Martin for over-pricing its F-35 fighter planes. Previous presidents, knowing they have the "bully pulpit," have generally been averse to the sort of jawboning that singles out specific firms and persons. President Harry Truman did take on a newspaper columnist who criticized his daughter, Margaret's, singing skills. President John F. Kennedy went after U.S. Steel and referred to price hikes from the industry as "a wholly unjustifiable and irresponsible defiance of the public interest." But generally, presidents do not want to be seen as bullies, preferring one competitor against another or frittering their presidential authority by getting into petty squabbles. In the midst of more serious matters of state, jawboning can be a serious distraction that alienates larger numbers of people who may side with the assailed. With Trump, none of this may matter. He has said repeatedly that he always slams back twenty times harder than anyone who slams him. He revels in his 20 million Twitter followers and loves how his tweets are carried by the mass media. That gives him a personal "mass media" which he controls, unfiltered by his antagonists in the press. Rather than playing the "going-through-channels" game in Washington, he'll want to throw his opponents off balance through personal attacks, including attacks on members of Congress and governors. He is into the psychology of human frailties, vanities and occupational vulnerabilities. He knows that jawboning one person, firm or politician will put others on the defensive wondering whether they will be next, or putting foreign powers off balance because of his furious unpredictability. The downside for Trump is that he will be so absorbed in jawboning and rebutting critics that he won't be paying attention to what his underlings are doing until trouble rises to his level for decision. Jawboning can lead to complex consequences when it comes from the most powerful office in the county. Should Trump use jawboning to give corporate gougers of workers, consumers, taxpayers and communities some pause and restraint, if not produce outright reversal of policy, he can become the champion of the underdogs and those bullied. He's already said that drug prices are too high. If he believes that plain fact, can you guess what he'll do next with his tweet on a specific company or a pay-or-die drug costing patients $100,000 or more a year? Trump is known not to like detailed immersion into issues or detailed briefings by civil servants. He likes to set the pace, establish the new focus of the day and, above all, get even with anyone who stands up to or embarrasses him. He seems to behave as if rules and norms do not apply to him. The strange Trump personality can radiate in many directions. Some results may be beneficial. Others - such as in the case of a stateless terror attack - may worsen a bad situation because of impulsive and violent over-reaction, leading to a worsening situation overseas and damage to the national interests, civil liberties and other constitutional rights of the American people.

The Air Force on Friday released its final request for proposal (RFP) on a contract valued at around $16 billion for a new T-X trainer to replace the venerable T-38. The Air Force also issued an RFP to purchase 17 E-8C Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System (JSTARS) planes that were first deployed as tank hunters in 1991 during Operation Desert Storm. The contract is valued at $6.9 billion for development and production. Three teams led by Northrop Grumman Co. (NYSE: NOC), Lockheed Martin Corp. (NYSE: LMT) and Boeing Co. (NYSE: BA) are already working on bids. Privately held Sierra Nevada may inject a surprise bid, and other prime defense contractors could also enter the fray. Defense Department acquisition chief Frank Kendall used authority ceded to him in the fiscal year 2017 National Defense Authorization Act to waive a congressional requirement that the contract be awarded only as a firm, fixed-price deal. The waiver allows the Air Force to proceed with its planned hybrid contracting strategy that includes both fixed-price and cost-plus elements. Air Force officials had argued that limiting the JSTARS deal to a fixed-price contract would delay the program by months. Secretary of the Air Force Deborah Lee James said: We realize intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance [ISR] is currently a combatant commander top priority. Given the language in this year’s defense policy bill, we took additional time before releasing the JSTARS request for proposal. With the support of the department on the importance of JSTARS to national security, we are moving out to deliver this critical ISR capability. We will continually look for ways to speed up the process towards initial operational capability. The current JSTARS aircraft, designated the E-8C, is a second-hand Boeing 707-300 that includes modifications and equipment installed by Grumman prior to its acquisition by Northrop. The plane is now being used to track down oil tankers, trucks and other vehicles used by the Islamic State terrorists in Syria and Iraq. Some of the existing planes have been grounded due to concerns over maintenance, according to Aviation Week. The Air Force RFP for the new planes specifically excludes used, reconditioned or remanufactured aircraft. Boeing’s 737-700, the smallest of the company’s commercial jets, is likely to be competing against a Northrop design that uses a Gulfstream G550 or G560 business jet and a Lockheed version of Bombardier’s Global 6000 business jet. The Air Force has determined it wants a smaller airframe than the Boeing 767-400ER originally specified and then scrapped in 2007 for cost reasons.

Photos of the weekend SUBSCRIBE About video ads A Cruze car is shown at a Chevrolet event in Guangzhou, China in November 2016. Bobby Yip/Reuters/File | Caption Steven Porter Staff | @reporterporter January 3, 2017 —Threatening once again to impose a hefty tariff on foreign-made goods, US President-elect Donald Trump singled out yet another manufacturing company Tuesday via Twitter, criticizing General Motors Co. for making some of its compact cars in Mexico. Since winning the presidential election in November, Mr. Trump has made a habit of targeting big businesses one by one, including United Technologies Inc., Boeing Co., and Lockheed Martin Corp., to name a few. A spokesman for his transition team said these individual critiques reflect a broader goal for the incoming Republican administration to rescue American workers. "In this case, the tweet was specific to General Motors," spokesman Sean Spicer told Reuters. "But I think you've seen an overall philosophy during the campaign and since he was elected to stand up for American workers and make sure that American companies don't benefit from moving their companies overseas and leaving American workers behind." Although not specific, Trump's Tuesday threat was clear: "General Motors is sending Mexican made model of Chevy Cruze to U.S. car dealers-tax free across border," he wrote. "Make in U.S.A. or pay big border tax!" General Motors is sending Mexican made model of Chevy Cruze to U.S. car dealers-tax free across border. Make in U.S.A.or pay big border tax!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 3, 2017 General Motors responded with a statement acknowledging that "a small number" of Cruze hatchbacks are manufactured in Mexico and sold in the United States. The overwhelming majority of Cruze models sold to Americans, however, are sedans – all of which are made in Lordstown, Ohio, the company said. Of the 190,000 Cruze models sold in the US last year, only 4,500 – less than 2.4 percent – were hatchbacks made in Mexico, a GM spokesperson tells The Christian Science Monitor in an email. Although sales were down significantly last year, the Cruze is one of GM's best-selling cars. How much do you know about the auto industry's future? Trump – who has denounced the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) among Mexico, the US, and Canada, which took effect in 1994 – did not specify how he would impose the tariff threatened in his tweet or how severe it would be. But the comment echoes past statements in which he has threatened to impose a 35 percent tax on foreign-made goods sold to Americans by companies that offshore American jobs, an idea economists have said would not work. "Imposing tariffs or putting up trade barriers may sound good, but it will hurt our economy and credibility," Wendy Cutler, a former acting deputy US Trade Representative who helped negotiate the Trans-Pacific Partnership last year, told Reuters in March. And others point out that presidents lack the authority to impose tariffs unilaterally without congressional approval, as CBS Money Watch reported. Hours after Trump's tweet about GM, rival carmaker Ford Motor Co. announced it would cancel plans to built a $1.6-billion factory in Mexico, instead investing $700 million at a factory in Michigan. Shortly before noon, Trump retweeted a link to a Fox News article praising him as "quite the job creator" for putting pressure on Ford and others to keep jobs stateside. "@DanScavino: Ford to scrap Mexico plant, invest in Michigan due to Trump policies"https://t.co/137nUo03Gl— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 3, 2017 GM chief executive Mary Barra is among business leaders who sit on a council unveiled last month to advise Trump on job creation efforts. Detroit's "Big Three" automakers – GM, Ford, and Chrysler – have all sought in recent years to produce more small cars in Mexico for the North American market in an effort to lower labor costs, while having American workers build trucks, sport utility vehicles, and luxury cars, which are more profitable. In 2014, GM announced a $5-billion investment in its Mexican plants, creating 5,600 jobs. In November, GM announced plans to lay off nearly 2,000 employees at two US auto plants in early 2017, including at the facility in Lordstown.

(AP Photo/Paul Sancya, File) Posted: Tuesday, January 3, 2017 9:00 am | Updated: 9:30 am, Tue Jan 3, 2017. Trump's latest US corporate Twitter target: General Motors Associated Press | 0 comments DETROIT (AP) — In another tweet targeting a U.S. company, President-elect Donald Trump threatened Tuesday to slap a tax on General Motors for importing compact cars to the U.S. from Mexico. But GM imports only a small percentage of its Chevrolet Cruze small cars from Mexico, with the vast majority made at a sprawling factory complex in Lordstown, Ohio, east of Cleveland. Trump tweeted early Tuesday that GM is sending Mexican-made Cruzes to the U.S. tax-free. He told GM to make the cars in the U.S. "or pay big border tax!" GM imports only hatchback versions of the Cruze from a factory in Ramos Arizpe, Mexico, and it sold only about 4,500 of them in the U.S. last year, spokesman Patrick Morrissey said. The company sold about 172,000 Cruzes through November. The hatchback, which went on sale in the U.S. in the fall, is built in Mexico for global distribution, Morrissey said. Cruze hatchback production amounts to less than a day of output at the Lordstown plant, said Glenn Johnson, president of a United Auto Workers union local at the factory. The union, he said, is not protesting the move to build the hatch in Mexico. "It makes for news, that's all," Johnson said of Trump's tweet. The Lordstown factory, he said, is not equipped to build the hatchback model. Trump spokesman Sean Spicer said the GM tweet wasn't about just one company. "I think he generally made it very clear he wants to bring American jobs home. He doesn't want jobs to leave this country," he said. Immediately after the tweet, which was posted around 7:35 a.m., GM shares fell about 1 percent in premarket trading. But by early afternoon they had rebounded and were up 0.5 percent to $35.01. The tweet was the latest threat from Trump to tax companies that move production to Mexico and ship products back to the U.S. Trump's targets have ranged from U.S. retailers and defense contractors, to tech companies. Amazon.com, Boeing and Macy's have been the subject of Trump tweets in the past. Last year Trump went after Ford Motor Co. for plans to shift production of the compact Focus to Mexico. Jobs at the Detroit-area factory that now makes Focuses would be preserved because the plant is to get a new small pickup truck and SUV. Ford announced Tuesday that Focus production is still going to Mexico, but it would scrap plans for a new $1.6 billion plant in Mexico. Instead, it will invest $700 million at a Michigan plant to make autonomous and electric vehicles, creating 700 U.S. jobs. Last year Trump touted a deal to keep 800 jobs at the Carrier furnace factory in Indianapolis from going to Mexico. He has promised to lower corporate tax rates to preserve factory jobs inside the United States, while threatening harsh penalties for companies that produce goods overseas to save on labor costs. On Twitter, Trump warned that he will impose a 35 percent tariff on the goods imported by companies that outsource production. Nearly every automaker produces small cars in Mexico to take advantage of lower labor costs. Companies have said it's difficult to make lower-margin small cars profitably in the U.S. due to higher wages here. Last year, GM, Ford and Fiat Chrysler made about 1.6 million vehicles in Mexico, about 17 percent of the vehicles produced overall in North America, according to the Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor, Michigan. That's projected to rise to 2.5 million, or about 26 percent, by 2022. Automakers and parts supply companies have added 12,000 U.S. jobs in the past year, according to government statistics. GM did import some Cruze sedans from Mexico last year to meet demand as it was rolling out a new version of the compact car, Morrissey said, but that has stopped and all sedans sold in the U.S. are now made in Ohio, he said. In November, GM said it would lay off about 1,250 workers at the Lordstown plant due to sagging demand for cars as U.S. buyers take advantage of low gasoline prices to buy trucks and SUVs. The workers on the third shift at Lordstown will go in indefinite layoff starting Jan. 23, although some may move to other GM factories. Workers on two shifts will continue making the Cruze in Ohio even though its sales were down more than 18 percent through November. Shifting demand from cars to trucks and SUVS is forcing General Motors to lay off more than 2,000 workers. Last month, 61.5 percent of U.S. new vehicle sales were trucks and SUVs, according to Autodata Corp., and analysts say there's no sign that will change anytime soon. ____ Josh Boak and Christopher S.

(Photo: Kenneth Lim)  Enlarge Caption  Email More A A SINGAPORE: Despite concerns that US President-elect Donald Trump’s isolationalist policies and his promise to withdraw America from the Trans-Pacific Partnership would hurt economic ties between the US and Asia, outgoing US Ambassador to Singapore Kirk Wagar says it will be “business as usual” for Singapore and ASEAN. “The concept that a trade agreement is a be-all and end-all for our economic engagement is insane”, he said on Tuesday (Jan 3), citing the nature of the US political system, American businesses’ long-term investments in Singapore, and the growing Asian middle class as some reasons why a Trump Administration will not close the door on deals. “Unlike most countries, our central government doesn't drive our nation,” Mr Wagar said. “I’m pretty sure that Tim Cook or Bill Gates never asked Barack Obama or will ask Donald Trump where they’re going to invest, where they’re going to expand, where they’re going to engage - and that’s who we are as a nation.” “I don’t think our politics is as relevant as our core national interests - being engaged here in Asia,” he added. We have survived in spite of Washington, not because of it.” Mr Wagar was speaking at a forum organised by the National University of Singapore’s Office of Alumni Relations, attended by 350 NUS alumni, staff, students and guests. He also described the US political system as “slow and laborious”, referring to the various checks and balances between the President and Congress. “There’s a lot of things we (the Obama administration) weren’t able to get to because of our system,” he said. TAKING STOCK OF US ENGAGEMENT IN ASIA The US is currently Singapore’s largest foreign investor, with investments reaching US$288 billion in 2015, according to the US State Department. Mr Wagar pointed out that 3,700 American companies are based in Singapore, and that the city-state’s reputation for “transparency and good governance”, “allows all countries to engage in this region”. "Any country that doesn’t understand the unique role that Singapore plays in the most dynamic region of the world suffers at their own peril," he said, adding that the country is "proof of concept behind what can happen when you open your borders with smart trade". The ambassador also cited growing Asian affluence as a reason for American companies to remain, with 525 million people in the middle class today in Asia. By 2030, it is expected that the number will grow to 3.2 billion.  For example, Asia is expected to account for one-third of global passenger traffic in the coming years. Aircraft giants Airbus and Boeing have predicted that Asia Pacific will take on close to 40 per cent of new aircraft purchases, worth US$2 trillion over the next 20 years. “There are more planes and equipment that’s going to be sold in Asia over the next 10 years than the rest of the world combined,” Mr Wagar told the audience. “Where are we going to be? Where’s Boeing going to be? Where’s General Electric going to be?” For these reasons, President Barack Obama’s “pivot to Asia” is likely to continue, Mr Wagar said, calling 2016 a “Year of ASEAN” for Washington. "President Obama attended seven out of eight East Asian Summits,” Mr Wagar said. Myanmar State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi made her first official visit to the White House. Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong also visited Washington - the first official visit by a Singaporean Prime Minister in 31 years. “What you did have for the first time was someone who understood South Asia, Southeast Asia, and he did certain things to accelerate and cement our engagement,” Mr Wagar said. FUTURE OF THE TPP Still, to many, Mr Trump’s promise to withdraw the United States from the Trans-Pacific Partnership - a 12-nation trade deal that was about eight years in the making - has been seen as a rejection of globalisation, possibly leaving many countries "feeling let down," as forum moderator and former Nominated Member of Parliament Viswa Sadasivan put it. Japan Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, for one, has said that the TPP “would be meaningless without the United States”. Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong has said that there may be a different, new deal in the future without the US - but this would mean putting negotiations back on the table. “The TPP without the US means it is a new agreement,” Mr Lee said at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) meetings in Peru in November 2016. “That means, the 12-minus-one will have to get together and sign an agreement with a different coming-into-effect clause. That is fresh negotiation, and that is not so easy to do.” But Mr Wagar, who was sworn in as US Ambassador to Singapore in 2013, remains optimistic. “I’m very proud of the work we do on the Trans-Pacific Partnership, and I think many countries in the region are going forward with it,” he said. “I’m hopeful that the facts will be re-evaluated by the new administration.” “The President-elect says it’s dead,” he added. “I say wait a while.”  - CNA/de Email More YOU MAY ALSO LIKE From Our Website From the Web Happening Now new window view more My Facebook Friends Back To Top JUMP TO Select Section Asia Pacific Singapore World Business Sport Entertainment Technology Health Lifestyle Videos Weather Photos Special Reports Archives Services PSI Navigate to: News TV Connect Watch Live GET OUR APPS iPhone/iPad Android Get Our News Facebook Twitter Linkedin YouTube Mobile SMS eNews RSS News Asia Pacific World Sport Technology Lifestyle Photos Archives Singapore Business Entertainment Health Videos Special Reports TV Live News Schedule Shows Services Weather ADVERTISE WITH US Online Mobile TV Contact Sales Channel NewsAsia Channel News Asia About Us Coverage Hotel Partners Events & Seminars Presenters & Correspondents Contact Us Mediacorp Mediacorp News Group © 2017 About Mediacorp Pte Ltd Terms and Conditions Privacy Policy Back To Top

There’s going to be a tendency in the media to minimize the impact of soon-to-be President Trump, in part because he so readily takes credit for positive developments. But, even if it’s fair to debate how radically, it’s hard to deny that Trump is reshaping the business climate. The most tangible example comes from Ford F, +0.32%  , which just announced the shelving of a $1.6 billion Mexican plant and instead plans to pour $700 million into one in Michigan. Read: Ford cancels plan for $1.6 billion Mexico plant Said Ford CEO Mark Fields, to CNN: “We look at all factors, including what we view as a more positive U.S. manufacturing and business environment under President-elect Trump. It’s literally a vote of confidence in some of the pro-growth policies that he is outlining.” There are real carrots that Trump is dangling, in addition to the sticks being brandished. The carrots are tangible: lower corporate taxes and less regulation. The sticks are Trump’s public criticism, aimed earlier at Ford, Boeing BA, +0.34%  ; Lockheed Martin LMT, +0.76%  ; Carrier, the United Technologies UTX, -0.54% air-conditioner maker; and, just Tuesday morning, General Motors GM, -0.45%  , as well as his proposal for a 35% repatriation tax on products built overseas and then sold in the U.S. Ford’s Fields stressed that “he didn’t cut a deal” with Trump, but, then, Trump doesn’t need to actually strike a deal if the net effect of his actions causes the desired change. That said, let’s also look at the reality of the Ford announcement. The vehicle that was going to be produced in Mexico, the Ford Focus, has seen dwindling interest. In the 10 months ending October, Focus sales tumbled 17.1%, as Americans, in light of $2-and-change gasoline and an improving economy, have been loading up on gas guzzlers. So the cost of getting on Trump’s good side is actually a pretty decent investment, and it’s as much due to the shale revolution (which has driven oil prices lower) and quite possibly the economic stewardship of President Barack Obama and Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen. That Trump deals don’t necessarily require corporate sacrifices also seems to be the case in the still-fuzzy Carrier deal, as well as the supposed “discounts” Boeing is offering on Air Force One. Even assuming the Trump impact on these particular cases is far less than he’s laid claim to, Trump’s rhetoric seems to be augmenting the business climate. Survey after survey, of both businesses and consumers, show rising confidence. Read: Manufacturers most upbeat in two years, ISM survey shows How that translates into actual activity remains to be seen. And there are obviously risks that Trump’s frequent rhetoric will backfire, that a recalcitrant or just hard-to-harness Congress will deflate the Trump balloon, that a rising dollar will curb exports, or simply that the business cycle turns sour. But no one has ever denied that Trump is a salesman. And right now what he’s selling, companies are buying — the need to announce that they’re creating jobs in the U.S. More from MarketWatch Future Shopping: AR Apps From Gap, Amazon and More Unlimited Data Returns...

(REUTERS/Rebecca Cook/File Photo) DETROIT/WASHINGTON: President-elect Donald Trump on Tuesday threatened to impose a “big border tax” on General Motors Co. for making some of its Chevrolet Cruze compact cars in Mexico, an arrangement the largest US automaker defended as part of its strategy to serve global customers, not sell them in the United States. Trump’s comments marked his latest broadside aimed at an American company over jobs, imports and costs before he takes office on Jan. 20, signaling an uncommon degree of intervention for an incoming US president into corporate affairs. “General Motors is sending Mexican made model of Chevy Cruze to US car dealers-tax free across border. Make in USA. or pay big border tax!” Trump said in a post on Twitter. Trump did not provide further details but previously vowed to hit companies that shift production from America to other countries with a 35 percent tax on their exports into the United States. He also has denounced the North American Free Trade Agreement between the United States, Mexico and Canada. GM, the world’s No. 3 automaker, said it sold about 190,000 Cruze cars in the United States in 2016. All of the sedan versions sold in the United States, or about 185,500, were built at its plant in Lordstown, Ohio. About 4,500 hatchback versions of the Cruze were assembled in Mexico and sold in the United States. “GM builds the Chevrolet Cruze hatchback for global markets in Mexico, with a small number sold in the US” it said in a statement posed on its website. The Cruze is one of GM’s best-selling cars, although its sales numbers were down significantly in 2016. Shares of GM rose 1 percent to $35.19 after falling about 1 percent following Trump’s tweet before the market opened. Since winning the Nov. 8 presidential election, Trump has targeted GM’s rival Ford Motor Co, United Technologies Inc. , Boeing Co. and Lockheed Martin Corp. Trump also has touted decisions by companies to keep some production in the United States, including United’s Carrier unit in Indiana. Last month, Trump announced the formation of a council to advise him on job creation comprised of leaders from a variety of major US corporations including GM Chief Executive Officer Mary Barra. GM said in 2015 it would build its next-generation Chevrolet Cruze compact in Mexico as automakers look to expand in the Latin American nation to take advantage of low labor costs and free trade agreements. The company said in 2015 it would invest $350 million to produce the Cruze at its plant in Coahuila as part of the $5 billion investment in its Mexican plants announced in 2014, creating 5,600 jobs. GM said last year it would import some Cruze cars from Mexico. Trump, a Republican who will succeed Democratic President Barack Obama, campaigned for president using tough rhetoric on trade and promises to protect American workers, and targeted several companies by name. His latest comments come as a congressional Republican tax proposal meant to boost US manufacturing faces mounting pressure from industries that rely heavily on imported goods or parts. ’BORDER ADJUSTABILITY’ Last month, 81 industry groups including several automaker groups rejected the proposal, known as “border adjustability.” The policy would help manufacturers by exempting export revenues from corporate taxes. But it would tax imports, hitting import-dependent industries. According to Automotive News, GM began producing the Cruze in Mexico last year, making 52,631 cars there. In comparison, it built 319,536 of them in the United States. Previous versions of the Cruze sold in Mexico were made in a GM South Korea plant, it reported. The shift is part of a larger trend among Detroit’s Big Three automakers to produce more small cars for the North American market in Mexico in an effort to lower labor costs, while using higher-paid US workers to build more profitable trucks, sport utility vehicles and luxury cars. In November, GM said it planned in early 2017 to lay off 2,000 employees at two US auto plants, including the one in Lordstown. US small car sales have been hurt by lagging consumer demand and low gas prices. GM’s US Cruze sales were down 18 percent through November. GM will halt the third shift at the Lordstown plant on Jan. 23, cutting 1,250 jobs. Representatives for the United Auto Workers union could not be reached immediately for a response to Trump’s comments. Facebook STAY CONNECTED Follow @Arab_News Tweets by @Arab_News Download The App!

His making it clear that the aircraft would be single engine means that double engine aircraft like F/A 18 by Boeing and Rafale by Dassault Aviation, both preparing for India's next round of multi-billion deal for fighters, are out of the race. Just-retired IAF chief Arup Raha had said India required about 200 medium weight category aircraft besides the 36 Rafale fighters. Parrikar also made it clear that navy will continue supporting the development of naval version of Tejas but the current one will be just a technology demonstrator. He said that the navy is seeking a double engine aircraft. He said when India decides to go for a twin-engine fighter to be made here, the government will also consider the Rafale. But as of now there are no plans to procure any additional aircraft, he added. Talking about the next fighter competition of India, Parrikar said the need for a second production line for single engine aircraft is felt besides the one for Tejas. "The second line of single engine requirement is also felt for which we are thinking of using the strategic partnership route," he said. The Defence Minister said once the chapter on strategic partnership is finalised this month, his ministry will start moving in the direction of single engine fighter aircraft. He said by the end of this year, decisions on the next aircraft should be tentatively finished. Parrikar said few of the initial aircraft may come off the shelf by the "rest would be made in India increasing the Indian capability in aviation". He said the process for the next fighter aircraft will include both selection through normal process and government- to-government contract. "Selection of the local partner would be through a transparent and well defined process," he said, adding that capabilities and financial strength would also be looked into. "Once you select the local partner, the OEM obviously will be selected through a process of the way we do it. It means who gives the best offer, Transfer of Technology and many other things and price. There will be weightage to both to both," he said. Parrikar added that once the company is selected, there will be a government-to-government contract to ensure that the other government stands guarantee to the promises made by the firm in terms of technology transfer and other issues.

Kirk Watson, D-Austin State Sen. Kirk Watson, D-Austin Image 2 of 2 State Rep.﻿ Giovanni Capriglione; R-Southlake State Rep.﻿ Giovanni Capriglione; R-Southlake Photo: Ian McVea, MBI Two bills seek to reopen public contracts detail 1 / 2 Back to Gallery AUSTIN -- Legislation was filed Tuesday to lift the curtain of secrecy on taxpayer funds spent by private companies and organizations allowed by separate Texas Supreme Court decisions. The bills by state Rep. Giovanni Capriglione, R-Southlake, and Sen. Kirk Watson, D-Austin, would overturn secrecy provisions sanctioned by the high court which allowed final contract details and bids on public contracts to remain secret. It would also require disclosure of funding details to private organizations and entities in all cases, not just ones that are sustained by public funds. The high court earlier allowed the Greater Houston Partnership to keep secret details about the public funding it receives and allowed the Boeing Co. to keep secret the final details of its contracts as trade secrets. Capriglione and Watson said both decisions significantly undermined the intent of the Texas Public Information Act, which gives citizens the right to monitor what its government is doing and how it is spending taxpayer money. "Unfortunately, these recent decisions from the Texas Supreme Court weakened the law by allowing governmental bodies and private entities that receive public funds to more easily conceal their dealings," Watson said. "I believe it is our duty as the Legislature to ensure the people of Texas can track how government spends public money." Capriglione said if the measures fail to pass, taxpayers will find themselves increasingly unable to know how public funds are being spent -- as has been the norm in Texas for decades. Citizens, businesses and competitors, lawyers and the press all use the public-information act to get information about government. Capriglione and Watson said the law is a capstone for transparency in government, one of the strongest in the nation, and they expect the changes will find wide support during the legislative session. They said a broad coalition of groups support the measures: Attorney General Ken Paxton, the Freedom of Information Foundation of Texas, the Texas Municipal League, the Texas Association of Counties, the Texas Association of Urban Counties, the Texas Press Association and the Texas Association of Broadcasters. Business interests that generally try to keep secret as many details of their operations as possible are expected to oppose the changes, although no public opposition has been announced.

Skip to main content DONATE SIGN UP FOR NEWSLETTER Search form Search Sunday, January 15, 2017 Home World U.S. Canada Climate War & Peace Economy Rights Solutions Ready for the Jawboning Presidency of Donald Trump Published on Tuesday, January 03, 2017 by Common Dreams Ready for the Jawboning Presidency of Donald Trump by Ralph Nader 0 Comments 'Want a New Year’s resolution?' writes Nader. 'Stay alert.' There's an erratic bully on his way to the White House. All signs point to Donald Trump becoming a jawboning president without equal in American history. That is, jawboning by exerting rhetorical bombast focused on people, corporations and institutions, with massive media propulsion behind the very personal presidency he will establish. It will be a natural daily extension of his boundless, easily bruisable ego. Trump has embraced these tactics as both a candidate and president-elect. He went after Carrier Corp. (a subsidiary of United Technologies) and Ford Motor Co. for shipping jobs to Mexico, after Boeing for charging too much for the new Air Force One and after Lockheed/Martin for over-pricing its F-35 fighter planes. Previous presidents, knowing they have the “bully pulpit,” have generally been averse to the sort of jawboning that singles out specific firms and persons. President Harry Truman did take on a newspaper columnist who criticized his daughter, Margaret’s, singing skills. President John F. Kennedy went after U.S. Steel and referred to price hikes from the industry as “a wholly unjustifiable and irresponsible defiance of the public interest.” But generally, presidents do not want to be seen as bullies, preferring one competitor against another or frittering their presidential authority by getting into petty squabbles. In the midst of more serious matters of state, jawboning can be a serious distraction that alienates larger numbers of people who may side with the assailed. With Trump, none of this may matter. He has said repeatedly that he always slams back twenty times harder than anyone who slams him. He revels in his 20 million Twitter followers and loves how his tweets are carried by the mass media. That gives him a personal “mass media” which he controls, unfiltered by his antagonists in the press. Rather than playing the “going-through-channels” game in Washington, he’ll want to throw his opponents off balance through personal attacks, including attacks on members of Congress and Governors. He is into the psychology of human frailties, vanities and occupational vulnerabilities. He knows that jawboning one person, firm or politician will put others on the defensive, and wondering whether they will be next, or putting foreign powers off balance because of his furious unpredictability. The downside for Trump is that he will be so absorbed in jawboning and rebutting critics that he won’t be paying attention to what his underlings are doing until trouble rises to his level for decision. Jawboning can lead to complex consequences when it comes from the most powerful office in the county. Should Trump use jawboning to give corporate gougers of workers, consumers, taxpayers and communities some pause and restraint, if not produce outright reversal of policy, he can become the champion of the underdogs and those bullied. He’s already said that drug prices are too high. If he believes that plain fact, can you guess what he’ll do next with his tweet on a specific company or a pay-or-die drug costing patients $100,000 or more a year? Trump is known not to like detailed immersion into issues or detailed briefings by civil servants. He likes to set the pace, establish the new focus of the day and, above all, get even with anyone who stands up to or embarrasses him. He seems to behave as if rules and norms do not apply to him. The strange Trump personality can radiate in many directions. Some results may be beneficial. Others – such as in the case of a stateless terror attack – may worsen a bad situation because of impulsive and violent over-reaction, leading to a worsening situation overseas and damage to the national interests, civil liberties and other constitutional rights of the American people. Want a New Year’s resolution? Stay alert, keep up with your fellow citizens at the Congressional grassroots, stay informed on current events, and always be ready to foresee and forestall initiatives by politicians and corporatists that recklessly or greedily gobble up your tax dollars and undercut your health, safety and civil rights.

Trump's comments marked his latest broadside aimed at an American company over jobs, imports and costs before he takes office on Jan. 20, signaling an uncommon degree of intervention for an incoming U.S. president into corporate affairs. "General Motors is sending Mexican made model of Chevy Cruze to U.S. car dealers-tax free across border. Make in U.S.A. or pay big border tax!" Trump said in a post on Twitter. Trump did not provide further details but previously vowed to hit companies that shift production from America to other countries with a 35 percent tax on their exports into the United States. He also has denounced the North American Free Trade Agreement between the United States, Mexico and Canada. Trump's tweet came hours before GM's rival Ford Motor Co announced it would cancel a planned $1.6 billion factory in Mexico and would invest $700 million at a Michigan factory, after it also came under criticism from the Republican president-elect for its Mexican investment plans. Ford's executive chairman, Bill Ford Jr., said he personally notified Trump of the decision, but after Trump's early-morning GM tweet. GM, the world's No. 3 automaker, said it sold about 190,000 Cruze cars in the United States in 2016. All of the sedan versions sold in the United States, or about 185,500, were built at its plant in Lordstown, Ohio. About 4,500 hatchback versions of the Cruze were assembled in Mexico and sold in the United States. "GM builds the Chevrolet Cruze hatchback for global markets in Mexico, with a small number sold in the U.S." it said in a statement posed on its website. The Cruze is one of GM's best-selling cars, although its sales numbers were down significantly in 2016. Shares of GM rose 1 percent to $35.19 after falling about 1 percent following Trump's tweet before the market opened. Since winning the Nov. 8 presidential election, Trump has targeted GM's rival Ford Motor Co, United Technologies Inc, Boeing Co and Lockheed Martin Corp. Trump also has touted decisions by companies to keep some production in the United States, including United's Carrier unit in Indiana. "In this case, the tweet was specific to General Motors. But I think you've seen an overall philosophy during the campaign and since he was elected to stand up for American workers and make sure that American companies don't benefit from moving their companies overseas and leaving American workers behind," Trump transition team spokesman Sean Spicer said. Last month, Trump announced the formation of a council to advise him on job creation comprised of leaders from a variety of major U.S. corporations including GM Chief Executive Officer Mary Barra. GM said in 2015 it would build its next-generation Chevrolet Cruze compact in Mexico as automakers look to expand in the Latin American nation to take advantage of low labor costs and free trade agreements. The company said in 2015 it would invest $350 million to produce the Cruze at its plant in Coahuila as part of the $5 billion investment in its Mexican plants announced in 2014, creating 5,600 jobs. GM said last year it would import some Cruze cars from Mexico. Trump, a Republican who will succeed Democratic President Barack Obama, campaigned for president using tough rhetoric on trade and promises to protect American workers, and targeted several companies by name. According to Automotive News, GM began producing the Cruze in Mexico last year, making 52,631 cars there. In comparison, it built 319,536 of them in the United States. Previous versions of the Cruze sold in Mexico were made in a GM South Korea plant, it reported. The shift is part of a larger trend among Detroit's Big Three automakers to produce more small cars for the North American market in Mexico in an effort to lower labor costs, while using higher-paid U.S. workers to build more profitable trucks, sport utility vehicles and luxury cars. In November, GM said it planned in early 2017 to lay off 2,000 employees at two U.S. auto plants, including the one in Lordstown. U.S. small car sales have been hurt by lagging consumer demand and low gas prices. GM's U.S. Cruze sales were down 18 percent through November. GM will halt the third shift at the Lordstown plant on Jan. 23, cutting 1,250 jobs.

GM will halt the third shift at the Lordstown plant on Jan. 23, cutting 1,250 jobs.

Make in U.S.A. or pay big border tax!" Trump said in a post on Twitter.Trump did not provide further details but previously vowed to hit companies that shift production from America to other countries with a 35 percent tax on their exports into the United States. He also has denounced the North American Free Trade Agreement between the United States, Mexico and Canada.GM, the world's No. 3 automaker, said it sold about 190,000 Cruze cars in the United States in 2016. All of the sedan versions sold in the United States, or about 185,500, were built at its plant in Lordstown, Ohio. About 4,500 hatchback versions of the Cruze were assembled in Mexico and sold in the United States."GM builds the Chevrolet Cruze hatchback for global markets in Mexico, with a small number sold in the U.S." it said in a statement posed on its website. The Cruze is one of GM's best-selling cars, although its sales numbers were down significantly in 2016.Shares of GM rose 1 percent to $35.19 after falling about 1 percent following Trump's tweet before the market opened. Since winning the Nov. 8 presidential election, Trump has targeted GM's rival Ford Motor Co, United Technologies Inc, Boeing Co and Lockheed Martin Corp. Trump also has touted decisions by companies to keep some production in the United States, including United's Carrier unit in Indiana.Last month, Trump announced the formation of a council to advise him on job creation comprised of leaders from a variety of major U.S. corporations including GM Chief Executive Officer Mary Barra.GM said in 2015 it would build its next-generation Chevrolet Cruze compact in Mexico as automakers look to expand in the Latin American nation to take advantage of low labor costs and free trade agreements. The company said in 2015 it would invest $350 million to produce the Cruze at its plant in Coahuila as part of the $5 billion investment in its Mexican plants announced in 2014, creating 5,600 jobs.GM said last year it would import some Cruze cars from Mexico. Trump, a Republican who will succeed Democratic President Barack Obama, campaigned for president using tough rhetoric on trade and promises to protect American workers, and targeted several companies by name.His latest comments come as a congressional Republican tax proposal meant to boost U.S. manufacturing faces mounting pressure from industries that rely heavily on imported goods or parts.'BORDER ADJUSTABILITY' Last month, 81 industry groups including several automaker groups rejected the proposal, known as "border adjustability." The policy would help manufacturers by exempting export revenues from corporate taxes. But it would tax imports, hitting import-dependent industries.According to Automotive News, GM began producing the Cruze in Mexico last year, making 52,631 cars there. In comparison, it built 319,536 of them in the United States. Previous versions of the Cruze sold in Mexico were made in a GM South Korea plant, it reported. The shift is part of a larger trend among Detroit's Big Three automakers to produce more small cars for the North American market in Mexico in an effort to lower labor costs, while using higher-paid U.S. workers to build more profitable trucks, sport utility vehicles and luxury cars.In November, GM said it planned in early 2017 to lay off 2,000 employees at two U.S. auto plants, including the one in Lordstown. U.S. small car sales have been hurt by lagging consumer demand and low gas prices. GM's U.S. Cruze sales were down 18 percent through November.GM will halt the third shift at the Lordstown plant on Jan. 23, cutting 1,250 jobs.Representatives for the United Auto Workers union could not be reached immediately for a response to Trump's comments.

While ambitious ideas such as crewed spaceflights to Mars may be out of reach for now, 2017 is still set to be an important one for space exploration and travel. Boeing Starliner Boeing is set to launch its CST-100 Starliner crew capsule in 2017, which aims to restore the USA’s capacity for manned spaceflight missions. The Starliner will make its maiden flight in December and will be used to ferry crew to the International Space Station in 2018. The capsule can support seven passengers and is designed for orbital missions of up to seven months. SpaceX Dragon 2 SpaceX’s Dragon 2 capsule is a manned space capsule capable of supporting a crew of up to seven people. The Dragon 2 capsule will support terrestrial soft landing aided by specially-designed boosters. The first orbital test of the Dragon 2 capsule will be in November 2017. Falcon Heavy The Falcon Heavy rocket is designed by SpaceX to ferry a crew to Mars, and produces a huge amount of power thanks to its large boosters and engines. The rocket is designed to be reusable, similar to previous SpaceX vehicles. The Falcon Heavy is expected to launch in 2017. Chang’e 5 Moon Mission China will conduct an unmanned lunar exploration mission in 2017, which aims to return over 2kg of surface material back to earth. The Chang’e 5 mission probe carries an array of surface analysis technology and will launch in 2017.

News Business Business Comment Britain faces debt crisis as advice charities warn of busiest Christmas in years Regulators would do well to review rules on how lenders deal with distressed borrowers, particularly if the economy takes a hit from Brexit  James Moore @JimMooreJourno Tuesday 3 January 2017 16:31 BST Click to follow The Independent Online Debt charities are being inundated with calls from distressed borrowers Rex Features With retailers preparing to reveal who won Christmas, the Money Advice Trust (MAT) has taken the opportunity of a quiet-ish corporate news day to highlighted the plight of the losers.  No, I don’t mean the chains which undershot analysts’ expectations and are now furiously discounting in an attempt to offload their excess stock. I mean the shoppers who, caught up in the pre Christmas frenzy, with all its special offers and Black Friday deals, over spent. The people for whom the new year will be anything but happy as they try to work out how to pay for everything they bought.  According to the MAT some 5.5m Britons are likely to fall behind with their finances this new year. Only a third have a budget, and perilously few have anything resembling a plan to repay debts that doesn’t involve more debt.  Read more Payday loan companies 'hounding' homeless teenagers, charity warns The Autumn Statement showed Brexit for what it really is Repo man pays off debt on elderly couple's car after towing it The charity is expecting its busiest January in years. During December the National Debtline and its sister service, Business Debtline, took an average of 715 calls a day. More than 40,000 people were helped online making it the busiest Christmas in four years.  The MAT is advising people to set a budget now, to open all their bank statements on the day they arrive, and to seek free advice quickly if things look dicey. All eminently sensible. But the fact is, there are an awful lot of people who will choose not to heed it.  They will instead put dealing with their situations off, and then put it off again. Maybe that scratch card will pay off in the meantime. Perhaps Auntie Nellie will have left more than anyone could have dreamed in her will. Perhaps an unexpected heirloom will be found in the attic. Putting things off in the hope that something turns up is easier than facing up to a harsh reality and you can't really blame people for doing so. It's human nature.  The British consumer has proved remarkably resilient in recent months, doing much to sustain the British economy through a difficult period. A lot of that resilience, however, has been fuelled by debt and debt has to be repaid.  About the best that the MAT, and other charities dealing with people struggling to do that, can do is to keep saying “call us” and “call us soon” because for most people that scratch card won’t come good.  Business picture of the day 31 show all Business picture of the day 1/31 Fiat loses $2.3bn in stock value plunge after diesel emissions accusation - Thursday January 12 Shares in Fiat Chrysler plunged on Thursday after US authorities said that the carmaker had violated the Clean Air Act by allowing excess diesel emissions in some vehicles.

In his speech to the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham today, Mr Hammond made no reference to that 15 per cent goal, merely referencing the existing policy for the levy to decline to 17 per cent. AFP/Getty There is also, however, a role that regulators can play. The rules covering how lenders treat distressed borrowers have been tightened in recent years. Some of the more sensible lenders have also recognised that calling in the heavy mob isn’t generally the best way of getting their money back. Working with borrowers on payment plans can pay dividends to all concerned.  Now would be as good a time as any to review the current framework and assess whether it is fit for purpose.  If the Brexiteers are right, and Britain continues to show resilience in the wake of Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty being triggered, then there will be no harm in doing the work anyway. If they are wrong, and the warnings of Jeremiahs such as myself prove justified, well, there will be a lot of people who have cause to be thankful if the watchdogs heed my advice. There are a large number of heavily indebted households in Britain. They won’t find it easy to weather an economic storm.  More about: consumer debt debt charity average Christmas debt personal borrowing Brexit Reuse content Comments Most Popular Video Sponsored Features Follow us: User Policies Privacy Policy Cookie Policy Code of Conduct Complaint Form Contact Us Contributors All Topics Archive Newsletters Jobs Subscriptions Advertising Guide Syndication Evening Standard Novaya Gazeta Install our Apps Close We've noticed that you are using an ad blocker.

REUTERS/Rebecca Cook/File PhotoMore By Bernie Woodall and David Shepardson DETROIT/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President-elect Donald Trump on Tuesday threatened to impose a "big border tax" on General Motors Co for making some of its Chevrolet Cruze compact cars in Mexico, an arrangement the largest U.S. automaker defended as part of its strategy to serve global customers, not sell them in the United States. Trump's comments marked his latest broadside aimed at an American company over jobs, imports and costs before he takes office on Jan. 20, signaling an uncommon degree of intervention for an incoming U.S. president into corporate affairs. "General Motors is sending Mexican made model of Chevy Cruze to U.S. car dealers-tax free across border. Make in U.S.A. or pay big border tax!" Trump said in a post on Twitter. Trump did not provide further details but previously vowed to hit companies that shift production from America to other countries with a 35 percent tax on their exports into the United States. He also has denounced the North American Free Trade Agreement between the United States, Mexico and Canada. Trump's tweet came hours before GM's rival Ford Motor Co announced it would cancel a planned $1.6 billion factory in Mexico and would invest $700 million at a Michigan factory, after it also came under criticism from the Republican president-elect for its Mexican investment plans. Ford's executive chairman, Bill Ford Jr., said he personally notified Trump of the decision, but after Trump's early-morning GM tweet. GM, the world's No. 3 automaker, said it sold about 190,000 Cruze cars in the United States in 2016. All of the sedan versions sold in the United States, or about 185,500, were built at its plant in Lordstown, Ohio. About 4,500 hatchback versions of the Cruze were assembled in Mexico and sold in the United States. "GM builds the Chevrolet Cruze hatchback for global markets in Mexico, with a small number sold in the U.S." it said in a statement posed on its website. The Cruze is one of GM's best-selling cars, although its sales numbers were down significantly in 2016. Shares of GM rose 1 percent to $35.19 after falling about 1 percent following Trump's tweet before the market opened. Since winning the Nov. 8 presidential election, Trump has targeted GM's rival Ford Motor Co, United Technologies Inc, Boeing Co and Lockheed Martin Corp. Trump also has touted decisions by companies to keep some production in the United States, including United's Carrier unit in Indiana. "In this case, the tweet was specific to General Motors. But I think you've seen an overall philosophy during the campaign and since he was elected to stand up for American workers and make sure that American companies don't benefit from moving their companies overseas and leaving American workers behind," Trump transition team spokesman Sean Spicer said. Last month, Trump announced the formation of a council to advise him on job creation comprised of leaders from a variety of major U.S. corporations including GM Chief Executive Officer Mary Barra. GM said in 2015 it would build its next-generation Chevrolet Cruze compact in Mexico as automakers look to expand in the Latin American nation to take advantage of low labor costs and free trade agreements. The company said in 2015 it would invest $350 million to produce the Cruze at its plant in Coahuila as part of the $5 billion investment in its Mexican plants announced in 2014, creating 5,600 jobs. GM said last year it would import some Cruze cars from Mexico. Trump, a Republican who will succeed Democratic President Barack Obama, campaigned for president using tough rhetoric on trade and promises to protect American workers, and targeted several companies by name. According to Automotive News, GM began producing the Cruze in Mexico last year, making 52,631 cars there. In comparison, it built 319,536 of them in the United States. Previous versions of the Cruze sold in Mexico were made in a GM South Korea plant, it reported. The shift is part of a larger trend among Detroit's Big Three automakers to produce more small cars for the North American market in Mexico in an effort to lower labor costs, while using higher-paid U.S. workers to build more profitable trucks, sport utility vehicles and luxury cars. In November, GM said it planned in early 2017 to lay off 2,000 employees at two U.S. auto plants, including the one in Lordstown. U.S. small car sales have been hurt by lagging consumer demand and low gas prices. GM's U.S. Cruze sales were down 18 percent through November. GM will halt the third shift at the Lordstown plant on Jan. 23, cutting 1,250 jobs.

News Sports Entertainment Life Obituaries E-Edition Cars Jobs Homes Classifieds log in Site Archive Cars We Remember: GMC powered Missile Transporter’ truck memories Tuesday Jan 3, 2017 at 9:44 AM Jan 3, 2017 at 9:44 AM Greg Zyla More Content Now Q: Greg, I recently found an article you wrote about the GMC V-12 engine. It brought back great memories of my time in the Air Force when I worked as a missile tech on the Minuteman Missile transporter (WS133 also known as the TE or TEL). To get to the missile sites we used a transport erector with a long trailer that had three axles. The tractor came with the with the GMC V-12 engine you wrote about in your previous columns. This V-12 was situated right under the (front) of the trailer. The cab was less than 48-inches high and had a two front axle setup that both could steer and also power and then a tag axle, too. The GMC V-12 hooked to a five-speed main transmission with an additional two-speed auxiliary. This GMC V-12 was the only engine the Air Force could find at the time to pull this unit when loaded with the missile. And yes, the GMC V-12 could pull very well. I had to wear ear plugs because you had to sit right next to the GMC V-12. Thanks for your articles.  Sgt. John Jankas, Navasota, Texas. A: Sgt. John what a great letter and I thank you in advance for your service and great memories of the GMC V-12 engine that powered the Air Force Minuteman Missile Transporter. Thanks up front to you and also to www.thunderV-12.com, the latter a company I have written about before that builds and sells the 702 cubic-inch Thunder V-12 to this day and has excellent information on their site about this engine and the missile transporters you drove. Much of the following narrative is not mine as also noted on the Thunder V-12 site as the author/source of the article wishes to remain anonymous. However he hopes the following information will help open a dialog here of an important piece of GMC V-12 truck and USA military history. If any of my readers have more info, please send it to mail@thunderV-12.com and cc me at greg@gregzyla.com. Specifically, back in 1960, some 80 Missile Transporters were scheduled to be built in a cooperative between Boeing, which sub-contracted to GMC for the tractor and engine, and Cessna for the transporters airbag suspension and a hydraulically-powered fifth wheel. As you mentioned and explained further by Thunder V-12, the 48-inch high tractor could be lowered or raised up to engage the emplacer. This allowed either fitting the missile into its tube for transportation or raising it high in the air to install the missile into its launch silo. The first drive axle was always live, while the second axle could be engaged to drive while the third was the tag. As you noted also, both front axles steer. As for the transporters wheels, the Alcoa aluminum rims are some of the earliest known to exist. Top speed in fifth and high gear is 45 mph. The engine supplies both cold and hot water to the huge missile containment fuselage to keep the missile climate controlled. Thunder V-12 also notes that the tractor did have a Pontiac compressor air conditioning unit, but none of it was for keeping the driver cool, it was all for the missile container. The GMC V-12 powered special purpose tractor truck transported the complete Minuteman III missile, without warhead, from the base out to the missile silo. Then the Cessna built monocoque trailer fuselage coupled with pins to huge structural members by the silo. Giant five section hydraulic actuators would then raise the body up vertical, and a winch would lower the missile into the silo. The roll transfer weight including missile and carriages was near 80,000 lbs. and the whole vehicle when loaded weighed about 139,000 lbs. The truck tractor cab was hand built by GMC and powered by the GMC 702-inch V-12. The cab was magnesium to save weight, and the anonymous author did say that this thing was really something else. The units pictured were built in 1961 and 1962 and hauled Minuteman missiles until retirement in 1990. Today, Hill Aerospace Museum in Roy, Utah, has a GMC V-12 powered TEL in place for the world to see. There is also one at Warren AFB, Wyoming, at the front gate and a third GMC V-12 powered Minuteman sits fully restored at Malmstrom AFB in Montana. If my readers would like to see a YouTube video of the GMC V-12 and the Air Force Missile production, its called Minuteman - From Design to Delivery (1963) about the missiles and vehicle in action. If you go to about 14 minutes into the video, youll see the truck in action. I want to thank Thunder V-12, LLC and the U.S. Air Force for supplying interesting information. And thanks again Sgt. John for your info from behind the wheel. Have a great New Year.  Greg Zyla writes weekly for More Content Now and other Gatehouse Media publications, He welcomes reader questions or comments on collector cars, auto nostalgia or old-time racing at 303 Roosevelt St., Sayre, Pa. 18840 or email at greg@gregzyla.com.

He declined to comment on whether the company planned to talk to Trump. Trump’s tweet is the latest example of interventionist behavior toward U.S. companies that have included Boeing Co., Lockheed Martin Corp. and United Technologies Corp. His threats against Mexican-built vehicles have the potential to impact the nine global carmakers, including Toyota Motor Corp. and Nissan Motor Co., that have announced more than $24 billion in Mexico investments since 2010. Volkswagen AG’s Audi, BMW AG and Daimler AG each build or plan to assemble luxury vehicles, engines or heavy trucks in the country. The Trump transition team has said Chief Executive Officer Mary Barra will be among the panel of business leaders giving him strategic advice on the economy after he takes office. GM shares rose about 0.2 percent to $34.90 as of 9:31 a.m. in New York. The Detroit-based company said in November it planned to cut a shift at its Cruze plant in Ohio and furlough 1,200 workers there due to weak demand for small cars. Trump has made a point of pressuring large U.S. manufacturers into keeping production in the U.S. He criticized Ford during the presidential campaign for moving production of the Ford Focus compact and C-Max hybrid to Mexico. In November, he said on Twitter he talked with Chairman Bill Ford and got the automaker to commit to keeping production of the Lincoln MKC sport utility vehicle in Kentucky instead of Mexico. At the time, Trump indicated he’d saved the plant. In reality, the plant was not scheduled to close. Its employees assemble the Ford Escape SUV, a better-selling model. More than 5,000 employees work nearly around the clock on three crews to meet demand for the two SUVs. Trump’s promise to make Mexico pay for a border wall seems less likely to be a burden in 2017 than his threat of retribution against companies that move jobs abroad. If that makes US manufacturers hold off or slow down investment in Mexico, the impact would be significant. More than half of the $30 billion in foreign direct investment in Mexico in 2015 came from the US. Already, Citigroup Inc. has cut its projections for total investment in Mexico from abroad for 2017, to $25 billion from $35.8 billion. Perhaps Trump’s biggest impact will be on the peso, which became a proxy for his election chances. It’s tumbled about 11 per cent since the vote to near record lows, putting pressure on the central bank to intervene as inflation expectations rise. Analysts say Mexico’s economy is in for a nightmare even if the incoming president doesn’t build that wall or ball up North American Free Trade Agreement. Economists forecast gross domestic product will expand just 1.7 per cent this year, according to the latest surveys from Banco de Mexico and Citi/Banamex, as anticipated rate increases weigh on borrowing and spending. That’d be the slowest since the 1.4 per cent achieved in 2013. “It’s going to be a very difficult year for policymakers,” said Benito Berber, the senior economist for Latin America at Nomura Holdings Inc. in New York. “The central bank will have to navigate a lot of different shocks, external and internal.” While forecasts are more dire at Credit Suisse Group AG and Bank of America Corp. — where economists anticipate growth could be the slowest since the height of the financial crisis — any threat to the North American Free Trade Agreement that started January 1, 1994, would make these seem rosy. Mexico sends more than three-quarters of its exports to the US and ran a trade surplus of about $60 billion in 2015, accounting for more than 5 per cent of economic output. Trump lashed out at a US company manufacturing in Mexico early on Tuesday.   Trump Twitter crosshairs: The companies singled out — AP Amazon “If @amazon ever had to pay fair taxes, its stock would crash and it would crumble like a paper bag. The @washingtonpost scam is saving it!” Trump tweeted on December 7, 2015. Carrier “Big day on Thursday for Indiana and the great workers of that wonderful state. We will keep our companies and jobs in the US. Thanks Carrier.” Trump tweeted on November 29, 2016. Ford Motor Co. “Just got a call from my friend Bill Ford, Chairman of Ford, who advised me that he will be keeping the Lincoln plant in Kentucky — no Mexico. I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me!” Trump said in a series of tweets on November 17, 2016 Lockheed Martin Corp. and Boeing Co. “Based on the tremendous cost and cost overruns of the Lockheed Martin F-35, I have asked Boeing to price-out a comparable F-18 Super Hornet!” Trump tweeted on December 22, 2016. “Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!” Trump tweeted on December 6, 2016. General Motors Co. “General Motors is sending Mexican made model of Chevy Cruze to US car dealers-tax free across border. Make in USA or pay big border tax!” Trump tweeted on January 3, 2017. Macy’s Inc. “Good news, disloyal @Macys stock is in a total free fall. Don’t shop there for Christmas!” Trump tweeted on December 4, 2015. T-Mobile US .@JohnLegere @TMobile John, focus on running your company, I think the service is terrible! Try hiring some good managers. Trump tweeted on November 15, 2015 Rexnord “Rexnord of Indiana is moving to Mexico and rather viciously firing all of its 300 workers. This is happening all over our country. No more!” Trump tweeted on December 2, 2016. Businesses in General “The US is going to substantially reduce taxes and regulations on businesses, but any business that leaves our country for another country, fires its employees builds a new factory or plant in the other country, and then thinks it will sell its product back into the U. S ... without retribution or consequence, is WRONG! There will be a tax on our soon to be strong border of 35% for these companies ... wanting to sell their product, cars, A.C. units, etc, back across the border. This tax will make leaving financially difficult, but ... but these companies are able to move between all 50 states and negotiate a tax free deal! Our country cannot keep losing these jobs, & won’t. These companies are able to move between all 50 states, with no tax or tariff being charged. Please be forewarned before making a very ... expensive mistake! THE UNITED STATES IS OPEN FOR BUSINESS.” Trump said in a series of tweets on December 4, 2016.

Ford, meanwhile, has decided to cancel building a new plant in Mexico. Kenneth Craig reports from New York. What is this?

If you'd like to learn more... - A A + Listen U.S. President-elect Donald Trump took aim at General Motors on Twitter Tuesday threatening to impose a “big border tax” on the car maker, alleging the company is sending “Mexican-made” Cruze models to the U.S. And General Motors’ stock fell almost immediately. “General Motors is sending Mexican made model of Chevy Cruze to U.S. car dealers-tax free across border. Make in U.S.A. or pay big border tax,” Trump tweeted Tuesday, before switching his focus to criticizing Obamacare.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 3, 2017 READ MORE: Canada looks to find common ground with US about NAFTA, says Canadian ambassador Shares of GM, which were at $34.38 in pre-market trading, fell about one per cent; however, shares bounced back, rising one per cent before the market opened Tuesday. WATCH: Autotrader analyst Michelle Krebs discusses Trump’s threat to impose a ‘border tax’ on GM vehicles made in Mexico.  However, GM later responded to Trump’s claims, stating most of its Chevy Cruze models are manufactured in the U.S. at it’s Lordstown, Ohio facility – except for the Chevrolet Cruze hatchback, which is made in Mexico for global markets. “All Chevrolet Cruze sedans sold in the U.S. are built in GM’s assembly plant in Lordstown, Ohio. GM builds the Chevrolet Cruze hatchback for global markets in Mexico, with a small number sold in the U.S,” the company said in a statement, according to CNBC. In November, GM said it plans to lay off 2,000 employees at two U.S. auto plants, including the Lordstown plant, in early 2017. READ MORE: U.S. applications to Canadian universities surge following Donald Trump win Reuters reported via sources that GM had planned to build the Cruze hatchback in Mexico while continuing to build the Cruze sedan in Ohio. The shift is part of a larger trend among Detroit’s Big Three automakers to produce more small cars for the North American market in Mexico in an effort to lower labor costs, while using higher-paid U.S. workers to build more profitable trucks, sport utility vehicles and luxury cars. During his campaign, Trump attacked U.S. automakers for threatening to outsource jobs to Mexico. He previously vowed to block Ford from opening a new plant in Mexico and threatened to impose taxes on cars it shipped back across the border. WATCH: Ford announces it will scrap Mexico production plant in response to Trump’s attack Trump would later take credit for stopping Ford from moving its plant to Mexico on Twitter; however, according to the Associated Press, Ford clarified it never intended to move an entire plant, just the production of one of its vehicles. Just got a call from my friend Bill Ford, Chairman of Ford, who advised me that he will be keeping the Lincoln plant in Kentucky – no Mexico — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 18, 2016 And its not just auto companies who are being targeted by the incoming president’s tweets. Trump’s targets have ranged from U.S. retailers and defense contractors, to tech companies. Amazon.com, Boeing and Macy’s have been the subject of Trump tweets in the past. Trump’s tweets have the power to move stocks Social media users were quick to point out Trump’s tweet about GM appeared to have a direct effect on the company’s stock. But this isn’t the first time Trump has influenced the stock market in 140 characters.   In December, Trump tweeted about the “tremendous cost of the Lockheed Martin F-35,” causing the aerospace company’s stocks to tumble. According to The Independent, Lockheed Martin shares fell about two per cent, while Boeing shares saw a one per cent rise that day. Based on the tremendous cost and cost overruns of the Lockheed Martin F-35, I have asked Boeing to price-out a comparable F-18 Super Hornet! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 22, 2016 But, earlier that month, Trump took aim at Boeing tweeting, “Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!” According to Slate, it only took ten seconds for Boeing stock to start trading down, eventually shrinking the stock value by over one per cent. This has raised concerns with several pundits, including LA Times columnist Michael Hiltzik who wrote, “Inevitably, pronouncements about anything by a president have an outsized effect. Sometimes that’s appropriate, but the power to move markets, like the power to deploy armies, is something to be used very sparingly, because people can get hurt by a stray remark or a stray artillery shell.” – With files from Reuters and The Associated Press © 2017 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.

Picture: APSource:AP Donald Trump has hit out at GM on Twitter. Picture: AFPSource:AFP Mr Trump tweeted early on Tuesday that GM is sending Mexican-made Cruzes to the US tax-free. He told GM to stop or pay a big border tax. GM released a statement saying it only brought in a “small number” of the Chevrolet Cruzes from Mexico. “General Motors manufacturers the Chevrolet Cruze sedan in Lordstown, Ohio. All Chevrolet Cruze sedans sold in the US are built in GM’s assembly plant in Lordstown, Ohio. GM builds the Chevrolet Cruze hatchback for global markets in Mexico, with a small number sold in the US,” the company said.

Picture: BloombergSource:Bloomberg Last year Trump threatened to tax Ford, which plans to shift production of the compact Focus to Mexico. Hours after the GM threat, Ford announced that it is cancelling plans to build a $US1.6 billion plant in Mexico and instead will boost US production of electric vehicles. “Ford today announced it is canceling plans for the new plant in San Luis Potosi, Mexico,” the company said in a statement. At the same time, Ford is adding 700 US jobs and investing $700 million during the next four years to expand its Flat Rock Assembly Plant in Michigan so that it can build self-driving and electric vehicles.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 3, 2017 One of Mr Trump’s first tweets after winning the election was aimed at Boeing, claiming he wanted to cancel the construction of the new Air Force One, falsely stating that it was costing $4 billion. After his morning tweets about GM, Trump then shifted gears and attacked the Affordable Care Act, otherwise known as ‘Obamacare’. “People must remember that ObamaCare just doesn’t work, and it is not affordable — 116 per cent increases (Arizona). Bill Clinton called it ‘crazy’,” he wrote. “The Democrat Governor of Minnesota said ‘The Affordable Care Act (ObamaCare) is no longer affordable!’ - and, it is lousy healthcare.” People must remember that ObamaCare just doesn't work, and it is not affordable - 116% increases (Arizona). Bill Clinton called it "CRAZY"— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 3, 2017 The Democrat Governor.of Minnesota said "The Affordable Care Act (ObamaCare) is no longer affordable!" - And, it is lousy healthcare.— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 3, 2017 Former US president Bill Clinton was critical of Obamacare during the election campaign. “You’ve got this crazy system where all of a sudden 25 million more people have health care and then the people who are out there busting it, sometimes 60 hours a week, wind up with their premiums doubled and their coverage cut in half. It’s the craziest thing in the world,” Clinton said. Former US president Bill Clinton has been critical of US President Barack Obama’s health care initiative. Picture: SuppliedSource:Supplied Mr Clinton tried to walk back the comments afterwards. “Look, the Affordable Health Care Act did a world of good ... we, for the first time in our history, at least are providing insurance to more than 90 per cent of our people,” he said. “But there is a group of people — mostly small business owners and employees — who make just a little too much money to qualify for Medicaid expansion or for the tax incentives who can’t get affordable health insurance premiums in a lot of places. And the reason is they’re not in big pools. So they have no bargaining power.” Jump back to top Right now in technology 472Readers Nintendo Switch: Australian price, release date, specs 326Readers This is what the world will look like in 250 million years 125Readers The Light Phone: The anti-smartphone doesn’t have text, emai... 46Readers Spaces launches first rocket since launch pad explosion MORE IN Motoring Diesel engines are damaging your health Aussie car industry’s grim reaper arrives Kia sedan woos the Holden diehards What luxury will look like in 2017 FOLLOW US ADVERTISE ABOUT US JOIN Please enter a valid email address Legal: Privacy Policy Relevant Ads Opt-Out Cookie Policy Terms & Conditions A NOTE ABOUT RELEVANT ADVERTISING: We collect information about the content (including ads) you use across this site and use it to make both advertising and content more relevant to you on our network and other sites.

By: Agencies | Updated: January 3, 2017 7:57 PM Representatives for GM could not be reached immediately for comment. (Reuters) US President-elect Donald Trump on Tuesday blasted US carmaker General Motors Co and threatened to impose a “big border tax” for making some of its Chevrolet Cruze cars in Mexico. “General Motors is sending Mexican made model of Chevy Cruze to US car dealers-tax free across border. Make in USA. or pay big border tax!” Trump said in a post on Twitter. Shares of GM fell about 1 percent in premarket trading after Trump’s tweet. Donald Trump has singled out a number of companies individually before and after winning the US presidential election. His targets have ranged from US retailers and defense contractors, to tech companies. Amazon.com, Boeing and Macy’s have been the subject of Trump tweets in the past. General Motors is sending Mexican made model of Chevy Cruze to U.S. car dealers-tax free across border. Make in U.S.A.or pay big border tax! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 3, 2017 GM imports only hatchback versions of the Cruze from a factory in Ramos Arizpe, Mexico, and it amounts to only a small percentage of the 172,000 Cruzes sold by GM through November, spokesman Patrick Morrissey said. He was working to get the exact number. The hatchback is built in Mexico for global distribution, Morrissey said. Cruze hatchback production amounts to less than a day of output at the Lordstown plant, said Glenn Johnson, president of a United Auto Workers union local at the factory. The union, he said, is not protesting the move to build the hatch in Mexico. “It makes for news, that’s all,” Johnson said of Trump’s tweet. The Lordstown factory, he said, is not equipped to build the hatch. You May Also Like To Watch This:  GM did import some Cruze sedans from Mexico last year to meet demand as it was rolling out a new version of the Cruze, Morrissey said, but that has stopped and all sedans sold in the US are now made in Ohio, he said. The hatchback version just went on sale in the fall. The tweet was the latest threat from Trump to tax automakers that move production to Mexico and ship products back to the US under the North American Free Trade agreement. In November, GM said it planned in early 2017 to lay off 2,000 employees at two US auto plants, including one in Lordstown, Ohio, where it builds the compact Chevrolet Cruze. You May Also Like To Watch This: The shift is part of a larger trend among Detroit’s Big Three automakers to produce more small cars for the North American market in Mexico in an effort to lower labor costs, while using higher-paid US workers to build more profitable trucks, sport utility vehicles and luxury cars. Last year Trump threatened to tax Ford, which plans to shift production of the compact Focus to Mexico. Jobs at the US factory that makes Focuses would be preserved because the plant would get a new pickup and SUV. Trump in a series of tweets on December 4, 2016, said, “The US is going to substantialy reduce taxes and regulations on businesses, but any business that leaves our country for another country, fires its employees builds a new factory or plant in the other country, and then thinks it will sell its product back into the US…without retribution or consequence, is WRONG!

Evan Vucci, File AP Photo i The Associated Press LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story Donald Trump has singled out a number of companies individually before and after winning the U.S. presidential election. Here's a quick rundown of the businesses he's targeted and what he has said. Amazon "If @amazon ever had to pay fair taxes, its stock would crash and it would crumble like a paper bag. The @washingtonpost scam is saving it!" Trump tweeted on Dec. 7, 2015. Carrier "Big day on Thursday for Indiana and the great workers of that wonderful state. We will keep our companies and jobs in the U.S. Thanks Carrier." Trump tweeted on Nov. 29, 2016. Ford Motor Co. "Just got a call from my friend Bill Ford, Chairman of Ford, who advised me that he will be keeping the Lincoln plant in Kentucky - no Mexico. I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me!" Trump said in a series of tweets on Nov. 17, 2016 Lockheed Martin Corp. and Boeing Co. "Based on the tremendous cost and cost overruns of the Lockheed Martin F-35, I have asked Boeing to price-out a comparable F-18 Super Hornet!" Trump tweeted on Dec. 22, 2016.

Businesses in General "The U.S. is going to substantialy reduce taxes and regulations on businesses, but any business that leaves our country for another country, fires its employees builds a new factory or plant in the other country, and then thinks it will sell its product back into the U.S....without retribution or consequence, is WRONG! There will be a tax on our soon to be strong border of 35% for these companies...wanting to sell their product, cars, A.C. units, etc., back across the border. This tax will make leaving financially difficult, but...but these companies are able to move between all 50 states and negotiate a tax free deal! Our country cannot keep losing these jobs, & won't.

Opinion Op-Eds Blumenthal: Messing With The F-35 Would Be Huge Mistake F-35 Getty Images One of the first two F-35 fighter jets bought by Israel is seen after landing at an Israeli base in the Negev desert on Dec. 12.  One of the first two F-35 fighter jets bought by Israel is seen after landing at an Israeli base in the Negev desert on Dec. 12.  (Getty Images) As a businessman about to become president, Donald Trump ought to know better. His threat to sink the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program sows uncertainty among our military and our allies, aids our adversaries, and confounds the companies and workers who make this next-generation combat jet vital to American air, ground and sea superiority. His 140-character tweet — one of a series that seem unwise and unproductive for an incoming commander in chief — jeopardizes jobs and national defense. The F-35 means thousands and thousands of jobs for Connecticut at Pratt & Whitney, where its unrivaled engines are made, but it is also a technological wonder vital to national security. Over the past six years, as a member of the Armed Services Committee, I have fought for the F-35 because it means that our nation and our troops will always have an edge — and never face a "fair fight" in air combat. Hostile nations have long sought to steal its design. The Russians and Chinese have flown prototypes of their own attempts at stealthier aircraft. In an era of mounting military threats, failing to build the F-35 on schedule would seriously risk losing our strategic edge. I have also advocated cutting costs — as has the manufacturer Lockheed Martin itself. As a result, the F-35's expense has been reduced by 70 percent since 2007. But the president-elect's suggestion that Boeing should "redesign" the aging F-18 to be "comparable" to the F-35 is nonsensical. The two jets, by design, are not comparable. The F-35 has stealth and strength that the older fighter cannot match — along with advanced technology that cannot be redesigned into the F-18. Different versions fit the distinct needs of different military services. The F-35A is a conventional multi-role fighter for the Air Force, the F-35B a short-takeoff-and-landing version for the Marine Corps, and the F-35C a carrier-based variant for the Navy. It can fly undetected, transmit sensor information, operate in formation, and conduct air-to-air combat and air-to-ground missions in ways beyond imagination in earlier aircraft. The F-35, of course, must be part of an overarching air strategy working in tandem with the rest of our air, sea and ground elements. No one asset is the answer. In fact, the F-35 can integrate and share information instantaneously with other aircraft and troops on the ground, providing unified situational awareness and coordinating combat power. Fortunately for our nation, we are committed to other stealthy and strong weapons systems, most prominently our submarine fleet, also proudly produced in Connecticut and not yet a target of Trump's tweets. Efforts to further cut costs are already underway. I will continue to press for more innovative ways to make the F-35 even more affordable. Central to this effort will be fulfilling — not cutting — our commitment to build these combat jets at full production of 80 aircraft per year starting in fiscal year 2019. I will be working to secure this outcome in coming years' defense bills. Having made the necessary investment, Congress should expedite using the F-35 and reject outright Trump's misguided call to delay deployment. Jeopardizing the F-35 program would lead to increased cost and risk for our military services and allies. The mere suggestion that production should be slowed or stopped threatens to create confusion and uncertainty among the manufacturers and their supply chain. There are more than 75 hardworking and dedicated businesses in Connecticut — and more than 1,250 suppliers across the country — that need to plan production and hire and train new workers now. The dedicated workforce recruited and trained to make these incomparably complex planes deserves respect and assurance in their jobs. Lowering expense, raising efficiency, improving production — all are good goals, we can agree. The entire military contracting and procurement process requires reform to eliminate the cost overruns and delays endemic to weapons production. That's a cause — bigger and broader than any single weapons platform — that should bring us together. It will require more than a tweet, even from the president, to achieve. It's called leadership.

Search Watch Live Home UK Brexit World Business Politics Technology Entertainment Strange News Weather Donald Trump threatens General Motors with 'big border tax!' The President-elect attacks General Motors over its use of Mexican plants and raises the prospect of steep import tariffs. 15:07, UK, Tuesday 03 January 2017 Image Caption: General Motors has come under fire from Mr Trump for having some production outside the US Twitter Facebook Google+ Whats App Mail Donald Trump has taken aim at US car giant General Motors in his latest clash with big business as he prepares to take office. The President-elect threatened to impose a "big border tax" on the company for making its Chevy Cruze model in Mexico. GM shares slipped 1% in pre-market trading after Mr Trump made the remarks in a tweet - though they later improved and turned 1% higher shortly after Wall Street opened. Mr Trump wrote: "General Motors is sending Mexican-made model of Chevy Cruze to US car dealers tax free across border. "Make in USA or pay big border tax!" General Motors is sending Mexican made model of Chevy Cruze to U.S. car dealers-tax free across border. Make in U.S.A.or pay big border tax!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 3, 2017 GM becomes the latest US industrial giant to feel the brunt of Mr Trump's remarks ahead of his inauguration later this month. Mr Trump has previously taken aim at aerospace manufacturers Lockheed and Boeing over contracts with the US government he has claimed were too expensive. Mr Trump has been critical of car giant Ford in the past over its investments in Mexico. More broadly he has threatened to slap tariffs of 35% on imports of products made by companies that have moved production out of the US, and said he would tear up a major trade agreement with Mexico and Canada. Image Caption: Donald Trump has warned US firms about moving jobs abroad Last month he warned that firms shifting jobs away from America could be "making a very expensive mistake" and  would face "retribution or consequence". Mr Trump has also pledged to lower the corporate tax rate and scale back regulations to create a better climate in the US for business. General Motors brands include the Chevrolet, Cadillac and Buick as well as Germany's Opel and Britain's Vauxhall. GM said that it makes the sedan model of its Chevy Cruze in the US and that all of those sold in the US were made at a plant in Ohio. A hatchback version is made for global markets in Mexico, with a small number sold in the US, it said in a statement.

The aircraft will serve the domestic link on a three times daily basis to ensure crew can secure required flight hours on the airframe ahead of its international debut. Korean Air will initially introduce the Boeing 787-9 into commercial operations on domestic flights from the end of the first quarter of 2017 for crew familiarisation, according to latest schedule changes highlighted by Airlineroute. The Dreamliner will be configured in a three-class seating arrangement and are expected to be mainly used in thinner long-haul markets complementing to Asian carrier’s larger 747-8I, 777-300ER and Airbus A380 equipment. In the latest update of its 2017 flight inventory, Korean Air will introduce the 787-9 on its Seoul Gimpo – Jeju route between March 7, 2017 and March 25, 2017. The aircraft will serve the domestic link on a three times daily basis to ensure crew can secure required flight hours on the airframe ahead of its international debut.  It is not clear when the airline will introduce the type into foreign markets, however, it has already loaded the type on three international routes from the second half of the year. This will see the 787-9 operate three weekly flights between Seoul Incheon and Madrid and four weekly flights between Seoul Incheon and Beijing from the start of August. The aircraft will also substitute an A330-200 on a three weekly Seoul Incheon – Zurich link from October 3, 2017. The Asian carrier has chosen to retain a First Class product onboard the aircraft, according to its aircraft listing, with a small six-seat Premium cabin. It will also fit its aircraft with an 18-seat Business Class cabin and 245 Economy seat to provide a total occupancy for 269 passengers. Korean Air has eleven 787s on order, including a single 787-8 which will be used in a corporate configuration for government flying. The aircraft was among on the first production aircraft, dubbed the ‘terrible teens’ which are much heavier than current production aircraft due to significant retrofits that are now incorporated into original assembly. Nine of its ten 787-9s on order were originally ordered as 787-8 and first due for delivery in 2011, but the order was switched in March that year for the larger variant and deliveries pushed back to this year. An additional order for a single aircraft was added in October 2013, according to Boeing. The initial European route selection for the Dreamliner suggests a move to use the aircraft to right-size capacity to better meet demand. The Seoul Incheon – Madrid route is currently served by a larger 777-300ER, but the introduction of flights to Barcelona from April 2017 may see demand fall a little into the Spanish capital. Meanwhile, in the case of Seoul Incheon – Zurich, the 787-9 will replace an A330-200, retaining a three-class offer but boosting capacity by around 50 seats per flight, albeit with a 25 per cent reduction in Business Class capacity.

News Business Business Comment Government is failing to boost exporters despite millions spent on ad campaign The number of British businesses selling products abroad hasn't changed in the last two years and Brexit will make things harder James Moore @JimMooreJourno Tuesday 3 January 2017 11:51 BST Click to follow The Independent Online Too many British businesses are reluctant to join the nation's exporters Getty Images The battering Brexit delivered to the pound appears to have had one benefit: It has made exports cheaper, and thus helped to narrow Britain’s trade deficit with the rest of the world from the gigantic to the merely large.  According to the Office for National Statistics it fell from £5.8bn in September to £2bn in October. A reason to feel cheerful, as some of the Brexit backing media would have you believe, amid excitable talk of record exports?  Hold on to your shipping containers for just a moment. The Institute of Chartered Accountants in England & Wales (ICEAW) has just released the results of a survey that looks at the Government’s attempts to stimulate exports over a rather longer term. The picture it paints is not a pretty one.  Read more FTSE 100 nears record high as companies take advantage of pound fall UK arms exports to Saudi Arabia ‘must end now’ Tariffs on UK car exports to EU would be 'disastrous' for jobs The ICAEW says that despite a £1tn export target and an extensive Government ad campaign designed to encourage businesses to contribute to reaching it, only 53 per cent of them are actually selling their produce abroad, unchanged from 2014.  Meanwhile nearly all (96 per cent) of the non-exporters that the organisation spoke to have no plans to sell overseas in the next 12 months.  “Come talk to us about exporting,” say the ads. “It’s great!” Or something like that.  Unfortunately the limited number of businesses that are thinking of exporting don’t think much of the idea of approaching the Government for help.  The ICAEW, which talked to 647 members working in private businesses, reports that less than a fifth of would-be exporters would use Government departments which promote international trade, such as the Department for International Trade, for information and advice. It looks very much like the millions of pounds that have been pumped into the campaign over the past two years have been wasted.  So what to do? The ICAEW wants the Government to change its approach, and start funnelling money directly to exporters rather than pouring it into the pockets of ad agencies and broadcasters. It proposes a voucher scheme to help with the (high) cost of researching and entering new markets. That might prove to be rather more cost effective than the current strategy.  If ministers don't like that idea they could, at the very least, talk to some of the businesses that are considering exporting, but aren’t considering approaching government for help, to ask why. And to ascertain what might encourage them to do so in future.  Business picture of the day 31 show all Business picture of the day 1/31 Fiat loses $2.3bn in stock value plunge after diesel emissions accusation - Thursday January 12 Shares in Fiat Chrysler plunged on Thursday after US authorities said that the carmaker had violated the Clean Air Act by allowing excess diesel emissions in some vehicles.

For a report published ahead of its annual summit in Davos next week, the WEF surveyed 750 risk experts and found that rising income and wealth disparity were cited as the most important trends in determining global developments over the next 10 years. Getty 3/31 Mayor Sadiq Khan axes new Routemaster bus from the streets of London - Friday January 6 London Mayor Sadiq Khan has ended any hopes to purchase new Routemasters bus for the capital's streets as he tries to balance the books on London's transport budget. Once called 'Boris buses' named after his the previous mayor, every bus would cost around £350,000 each, or around £50,000 more than an ordinary bus. But the new mayor has promised to freeze purchases of the vehicles, which were criticised for being expensive and sauna-like conditions.

In his speech to the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham today, Mr Hammond made no reference to that 15 per cent goal, merely referencing the existing policy for the levy to decline to 17 per cent. AFP/Getty The trouble is it's often hard to get a message like this through to a government which might very well prefer to point to the figures as evidence of a Brexit export bump. Even if the Office for National Statistics says it’s far to early to read anything into one month of data.  It gets worse when you consider that a large number of the ICAEW members who responded to the survey cited Europe as a key market.  Brexit is going to make exporting into that market very much more difficult. Even if the Government faces down the blinkered backers of a “hard” Brexit, firms will still face the new annoyance of customs checks they didn’t previously encounter, not to mention other barriers and bureaucracy that Brexit will impose on them. Just ask Norway, which is still a part of the single market, a benefit British firms are unlikely to enjoy after this country's EU membership has been consigned to history.  More about: Export exporter ICAEW Department for International Trade British economy Reuse content Comments Most Popular Video Sponsored Features Follow us: User Policies Privacy Policy Cookie Policy Code of Conduct Complaint Form Contact Us Contributors All Topics Archive Newsletters Jobs Subscriptions Advertising Guide Syndication Evening Standard Novaya Gazeta Install our Apps Close We've noticed that you are using an ad blocker.

News Business Business News UK manufacturing growth hits highest level since June 2014 Purchasing Managers Index shows increased orders from home and abroad but cost pressures have also risen Ben Chapman Tuesday 3 January 2017 13:00 BST Click to follow The Independent Online Manufacturers reported increased orders in December despite warnings of gathering clouds on the horizon Reuters UK manufacturing is growing at its strongest rate in two-and-a-half-years, a new survey showed on Tuesday. The UK Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index hit 56.1 in December, up from 53.4 in November and far ahead of analysts expectations of 53.3 and the survey’s long-run average of 51.5. The number is consistent with an increase in output of 1.5 per cent in the quarter. New orders from both home and abroad fuelled the expansion, said Markit who carried out the survey. However, the report sounded a note of caution as cost pressures on factories also increased, as a weakened pound raised import prices while fuel costs have also risen. This is expected to result in higher prices for shoppers in 2017. Read more Manufacturing slows unexpectedly in November Britain’s economy has so far performed better than many economists predicted in the wake of June’s Brexit vote. Consumer spending has remained buoyant, partly fuelled by record credit card debt. “The boost to competitiveness from the weak exchange rate has undoubtedly been a key driver of the recent turnaround, while the domestic market has remained a strong contributor to new business wins,” said Rob Dobson, senior economist at IHS Markit. “Of the companies citing a cause of higher costs, 75 per cent linked the increase to the exchange rate,” Dobson said.

Comment Comment Theresa May’s Government must come clean on a dire defence dilemma - Robert Fox We need a cold, hard look at our defence needs, what we can afford and what can be done with allies ROBERT FOX Tuesday 3 January 2017 11:37 BST Click to follow The Evening Standard Theresa May: expected to announce cutbacks in the UK’s armed forces this year PA Sooner rather than later in this new year, the May Government will have to come clean and announce further cutbacks in the UK’s defences and armed forces. With the slide of the dollar against the pound since June 24, the defence programme looks all but unaffordable, with as many holes in its projections as a Gruyère cheese. From this year on, the huge amounts of equipment, maintenance and support, paid for in dollars, will cost between a quarter and a third more than was budgeted for a year ago. The assumption for many programmes was an exchange rate of $1.51 to the pound. It is now $1.22. This shoves up the price enormously of the 50 new Apache helicopters and the nine P-8A patrol aircraft ordered from Boeing for £6.5 billion last summer. The slide in the pound makes the plans to buy an unspecified number of F-35 fighters for the new aircraft carriers all but unviable. Interestingly enough, Donald Trump seems to think that the $1.5 trillion F-35 programme may be unaffordable for the US too. The present plans on the table are unaffordable at the new prices, particularly if you take the plan to renew the Trident missile system into consideration. By some estimates the whole package could cost £200 billion.  It cannot all be done on a current budget of about £35 billion a year. More to the point, there are projected cuts in personnel. Some serving soldiers are talking about “living with an Army of around 70,000”. The present notional fighting strength is 80,000. Some think the real fighting strength could slip to around 65,000 or slightly lower by 2020. This is the heart of the matter because it raises the question of what we in the UK want, or need, our armed forces for in the mid-21st century? It is something about which most of our politicians, of whatever stripe, and civil servants, seem to have only the haziest notion.  Certainly, we are not asking for big battalions to invade Crimea, or charge recklessly into Iraq, which the UK did twice in 12 years, each time with a force of 45,000.  Read more Sword and body armour among 400 items stolen from Ministry of Defence What is needed is a proper cold, hard look at what we require in defence and security needs, what we can afford, and what can be done with allies. But didn’t we have all this with the so-called Strategic Defence Review of Blair in 1998 and Cameron in 2010 and 2015? To call the reviews strategic is almost an offence against the Trade Descriptions Act. All three reviews led to cuts, and the first item civil servants look at is personnel. “It’s easier to get rid of people than break big equipment contracts,” a former permanent secretary once told me. Not one of the reviews was costed properly, which is part of today’s maelstrom. As for strategic vision or the lack of it, Cameron’s last review made scant mention of the world’s second military power, China. At the centre of Britain’s strategic and defence crisis is the echo chamber that so many of the defence establishment now seem to inhabit. They reiterate their own comforting views that reinforce and flatter their own positions. One of the strongest conclusions of the Chilcot inquiry was that those in charge were reluctant to admit to themselves and others when things were going wrong in Iraq and Afghanistan.  They preferred to kid themselves rather than act on uncomfortable truths. It is time for the kidding to stop.

The assertion about his hacking expertise was a little hard to believe, given that Trump famously doesn't use a computer, and when the issue of cybersecurity comes up, he tends to refer to "the cyber" and tout his young son's supposed wizardry as a reason to be confused and afraid of what these new-fangled machines can do. "I have a son — he's 10 years old. He has computers. He is so good with these computers. It's unbelievable. The security aspect of cyber is very, very tough," he said at one of his debates with Hillary Clinton. His latest remarks simply must be quoted in full to be appreciated: If you have something really important, write it out and have it delivered by courier, the old fashioned way because I'll tell you what, no computer is safe. I have a boy who's 10 years old, he can do anything with a computer. You want something to really go without detection, write it out and have it sent by courier. Perhaps this is a shrewd job-creation initiative, since in Trump's vision half the American population would have to be employed as couriers to deliver the emails the other half will write. And although Trump is blowing off intelligence briefings, he's got some news to break this week. While we wait for the transformation that will result from our new courier-based economy, he'll tell us what's really going on with the Russians. "Hacking is a very hard thing to prove. So it could be somebody else. And I also know things that other people don't know, and so they cannot be sure of the situation," he said. Asked what he knew that others didn't, he said, "You'll find out on Tuesday or Wednesday." As exciting as that prospect may be, I have some bad news: There will be no revelations of what Trump has discovered about the hacking. Not on Tuesday, not on Wednesday, not ever. This is just one example of a disturbing reality that we haven't yet figured out how to deal with: the fact that we can trust almost nothing that comes out of the mouth of the man who is about to be president of the United States. This fact has highlighted the insufficiency of the press' normal way of doing things. For instance, since the president is the most powerful person on earth, pretty much everything he says is, by definition, news. But with Trump, that has led to an entirely new genre of story, which comes down to "Trump Tweets Thing." Since he hasn't held a press conference since July and may never hold one again, reporters are left with his Twitter feed as almost the only source of presidential communication. So they write entire stories about tweets he sends, often without the context that would allow audiences to understand how ludicrous so much of what he claims is. As we try to figure out what's going on, even Trump's closest aides can't really be trusted to tell us what he's thinking or what he'll do, not because they're necessarily lying in a particular moment (they may or may not be) but because even if they're telling the truth as they believe it right then, Trump may contradict them or take another position within hours or even minutes. The confusion this creates is just what Trump wants, whether it's about specific facts or the general feeling of rootlessness we'll get from his rule. Media scholar Jay Rosen calls what Trump is doing "verification in reverse," a process by which he "takes facts that have been nailed down, and introduces doubt about them, which then releases energy (controversy, resistance, ready-to-hate news coverage) which in turn helps power a movement among those who wanted the established facts repealed, as it were." So we're left with a dizzying combination of inaccessibility, communication primarily via a Twitter feed that combines desperately insecure pleading about what a great landslide he achieved (yes, he's still talking about that) with absurd falsehoods, and occasional mini-campaigns meant to cast Trump as racking up heroic accomplishments that don't actually exist. My favorite early example came over Air Force One. Trump tweeted a complaint about the cost of the new versions of the plane (which is still in the development phase), pretending that cost estimates some analysts had made of what we might eventually spend actually represented money we're already spending. The show reached its final act with a meeting between Trump and the company's CEO, as I described here: The chief executive of Boeing comes to meet with Trump and says to him, Oh yes, we'll certainly work hard to bring in the plane for less than $4 billion. He's not making any promises that need to be kept, because as he knows well (though Trump may or may not), military contracting, especially for a complex system such as these planes, is a spectacularly complicated process that plays out over years or even decades and involves not just the White House but also a large Pentagon bureaucracy and Congress — and the latter two are more important to the eventual outcome. But in the short term, what's the result? The chief executive steps out to the cameras after his meeting with Trump and makes clear that Boeing is pledging to do right by the taxpayer, resulting in a whole lot of headlines suggesting that Trump's terrific negotiating skills have given those taxpayers a great deal, when in fact precisely nothing has changed. Trump hasn't actually saved a penny on Air Force One. It was all theater. We've seen similar kinds of showmanship on economic issues, as when Trump claimed that because of his brilliant leadership, Sprint had agreed to bring 5,000 jobs to America. In fact, this was part of an investment Sprint's parent company made last year. But Trump got a raft of glowing headlines out of the story anyway, despite the fact that he was being disingenuous about those jobs. Can you actually govern this way? We just don't know, because no one has ever tried. So far it's working well enough, and I have an idea about where he's going next: He'll claim that all the economic progress under Barack Obama was his doing. Right now the economy is doing extremely well by most measures — unemployment is at 4.6 percent, over 15 million jobs have been created since the Great Recession, inflation is almost non-existent, wages are growing, and GDP growth in the third quarter was a healthy 3.5 percent. During the campaign, Trump described the economy as a nightmare of endless suffering and despair, but he'll now characterize it as a dream of boundless growth and opportunity, brought about by his extraordinary leadership. Not long ago he tweeted, "The U.S. Consumer Confidence Index for December surged nearly four points to 113.7, THE HIGHEST LEVEL IN MORE THAN 15 YEARS! Thanks Donald!" This was despite the fact that the Index has been rising steadily since 2009; December's number was just the latest uptick in a long rise. Some time in March, you can expect Trump to take credit for the arrival of spring. When he does so, it's incumbent upon the media to provide context — not in the 14th paragraph of a story, but right up top, along with whatever claim Trump is making. That means the story should read, "Trump takes credit for continuation of good economy," not "Trump touts good economic news." His spin has to be reported, but his spin doesn't have to be adopted. And when he says he'll do something — like release his tax returns (which he is never, repeat, never going to do) or reveal important new facts about Russian hacking — and then tries to get away with not following through, we all have to hold him to account. Trump exists in a world where facts are irrelevant, lying is permissible, and words are nothing but tools to "win" every encounter and establish his dominance. The question for the rest of us is whether we submit, or hold on to some connection to reality. Try 4 Risk-Free Issues of The Week magazine.

The returns showed a deep red-blue divide between rural and urban areas, as usual emphasized by the divide delineated by the Cascades. Predictably, a new bill has been submitted in the state House of Representatives suggesting that Eastern and Western Washington are just too different to be part of the same state. State Reps. Matt Shea and Bob McCaslin from Spokane Valley and David Taylor of Moxee are proposing to split Washington into two states by making the land east of the Cascades into a new state named Liberty. No one thinks the bill will go anywhere, least of all the hometown newspaper, the Spokane Spokesman-Review, which points to the long, failed history of such schemes and calls it a folly. Disturbing, though, is the rationale put forth by the politicians. The bill says, “Since statehood, the lifestyles, culture, and economics of eastern and western Washington have been very different. The urbanization and rapid growth in the western portions of the state has progressively heightened this divergence of cultural and economic values between the western and eastern portions of the state.” The reaction by some in liberal Seattle was mocking and hostile (see The Stranger’s response by Sean Nelson), one sign of a kind of psychic secessionism going on in Seattle as many seek to hunker down in the sanctuary of the liberal bubble. But the city does not end at the city limits. Read environmental history and you’ll learn that the cities shape the suburbs, exurbs and rural areas, and vice versa. William Cronon’s epic book, Nature’s Metropolis: Chicago and the Great West, is a classic work about the expansive, transformative power of cities that extend far out into the hinterlands, and the symbiotic relationships that result. Cities are vast ecosystems, more than just measures of density or amenities. Seattle needs Eastern Washington in the most basic ways — power, agriculture, access, wine! — and Eastern Washington needs the West Side’s ports, culture, markets, jobs and tax money. While being separate states doesn’t preclude any of these things, it complicates them, not to mention the management of resources. The idea that our differences of “lifestyles,” “culture” and “values” seems to be coded dog whistling — and born of ignorance. The implication is that the state must be defined by ideological or racial, ethnic or religious affiliations. That is in conflict with the concept of the so-called State of Liberty. If liberty means being free of having to deal with people who are different than you, how is that ultimately liberating? Shades of this thinking showed up in a recent article where my colleague David Kroman reported on a trip to Ritzville in Adams County following the November election. He asked folks in a local coffee shop about the election. Their notion of urban people seemed to focus on the perception that certain people (read: African Americans) were looking for a government handout. Which is a funny point of view given how much of the economic activity and employment in Eastern Washington is government dependent. That contradiction, when pointed out, only elicited chuckles. The problems and rifts between urban and rural are anything but new, and rural America has been in one crisis or another for over 100 years. Cities are growing and their economies are becoming less directly dependent on rural economies, but the landscape of agriculture itself is changing: automation, consolidation and corporatization. Those are problems we have in the big city too, whether you’re a Boeing machinist or an Amazon warehouse worker. There seems to be a sense on the part of some rural folks that they’re the only ones who work hard. Urbanites might not have dirt under their fingernails unless they’re working a neighborhood p-patch, but most people I know in Seattle work their asses off. Even the rich ones. For the urban middle and working classes especially, big city life is not easy, even in these boom times. The problem is, rural resentment of lazy city folk and urban resentment of the hicks is the function of separation and disconnection. Which takes me back to the 1980s when I was an editor at an independent magazine that sought to connect the whole state. Washington magazine was founded in Bellevue by Longview Publishing and operated out of Seattle, but editorially we covered all of Washington. Our editorial goal was to lift what we called “the Cascade Curtain.” In those days, there was a sense of rivalry — Huskies vs. Cougars, Dryside vs. Wetside, apples vs. salmon — defined by the Cascade ridge line. The differences then were more a subject of humor, and badges of belonging. There wasn’t the kind of polarization we see now, even politically. The Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, after all, was Tom Foley, a Democrat from Spokane. The governor of Washington was John Spellman, a moderate Republican from Seattle. Both things are hard to conceive of now. Yes, politics in Olympia is nasty — it has always been: An 1863 Seattle newspaper described the territorial capital as a “political trading post or slaughter house” of “official imbecility.” So the state has one longstanding thing in common: dislike of Olympia. I suppose if you are an Eastern legislator who only comes over the mountains during session, your view of Wetside humanity might be skewed. And if you’re a Seattleite who has never visited Eastern Washington because …  —  well, why? — it might be because you’re a smug urban snob who needs to get out more. Washington magazine, long since deceased, gave me a chance to work with writers and photographers all over the state — it was lavishly illustrated and my boss was an old LIFE magazine hand, Ken Gouldthorpe, who was a tireless promoter of state unity (he later headed the state’s tourism division under Gov. Booth Gardner). I had a chance to poke around every corner of Washington, from Oysterville to Usk. Our biggest subscriber penetration, percentage-wise, was Central Washington, from Wentachee to the Tri-Cities — people who knew the state because they traveled in both directions regularly. But what I remember was the sense that people in Washington have a lot in common and are deeply interconnected. Farm kids moved to the city for jobs; city people retired to the country. People in Eastern Washington came West to buy appliances. People in the West went over the mountains to hunt and fish. There was beauty everywhere, and a common devotion to that. In the mid-1980s, the magazine hooked up with a program being revived by the Washington Association of Wheat Growers called the Farm-City Swap. People filled out an application in the magazine to spend a weekend on a wheat ranch in Eastern Washington and agreed to host a farm family at their place in the winter after harvest. Tons of people applied and were linked up — think Match.com. I got matched to a farm near Connell in Franklin County and took my family there. We rode a combine and “helped” with the harvest. We ate as heartily as if we were actually working in the fields, we attended a local church service, and made a run to see Palouse Falls. Most of all, we were impressed by our wonderful hosts — a matriarch who ran things from the family kitchen with the authority of Captain Kirk. We learned about the complexity of the government’s farm program, and why a college degree from WSU was important to keep ahead of business and technological trends. I remember her son who ran the harvest telling me that farming was 24/7 — but that it wasn’t a job, but a way of life. You didn’t count hours, or days off, or overtime. You just did what was necessary each day, and enjoyed the downtime when it came — not unlike the life of a writer, I thought. I remember talking to Swappers including farmers from Eastern Washington who were surprised at the commonalities they found with growers like the tulip farmers of the Skagit Valley or with island dwellers who had similar senses of self-reliance. Living on a farm in the middle of wheat country is a bit like island living. We can lecture each other about the right way to live, we can settle into our prejudices — reinforced, often, by the very media that are supposed to connect us. But nothing substitutes for spending time with each other, learning how others live, finding human commonalities that live outside the voting booth. It behooves us to see each other as three-dimensional, complicated beings, not just the cutouts presented on TV or Twitter. Dividing the state is exactly the wrong answer.

Photo by Angela Lewis Foster /Times Free Press. HUNTSVILLE, Ala. — Donald Trump has only hinted at the future of NASA. But his campaign suggestions — more deep space exploration, less Earth science — seem to bode well for Alabama and for Marshall Space Flight Center. The center's 6,000-person workforce is a key part of Huntsville's economy. And deep space exploration plays to Marshall's strengths as NASA's propulsion center and manager of the Space Launch System (SLS), the new rocket capable of going beyond Earth orbit to deep space. NASA employees here say they heard the question often over the holidays: "How do you feel about Trump?" One employee's answer seemed to stand out: "We're certainly better positioned than last time." The last time the White House changed occupants, incoming President Barack Obama canceled the NASA rocket program being developed in Huntsville. Constellation, as it was called, was designed for America's space goals under Obama's predecessor, former President George W. Bush. It was to enable a permanent moon base to support missions to "Mars and other destinations." Constellation employed 500 NASA civil service workers and nearly 2,000 contractor employees in Huntsville. In the budget fight that followed, only the NASA employees kept their jobs. Obama cut Constellation from his 2010 budget after a study panel found it behind schedule and over-budget. That finding fit with Obama's preference to spend money on Earth science, including climate change research, and developing commercial space companies like SpaceX and Orbital ATK. Those companies are now sometimes referred to as "new space." During Obama's two terms, SpaceX would receive more than $4 billion in government funding to help develop a rocket and capsule that now supplies the International Space Station and will eventually fly astronauts there. But a Senate led by Sen. Richard Shelby and other NASA-state lawmakers forced Obama to also fund a sort of Constellation-light program NASA named the Space Launch System. The SLS booster and Orion capsule are being built by what are called "legacy" space companies such as Boeing and Lockheed Martin. "It seems to me the re-election of Sen. (Richard) Shelby will have more impact on Huntsville than Mr. Trump," George Washington University space policy expert John Logsdon said two days after the election. Logsdon spoke before Sen. Jeff Sessions emerged as Trump's choice for Attorney General and one of his closest advisers. Sessions even has the power to influence NASA's next administrator, according to the Wall Street Journal. During the campaign, Trump surrogate and former Congressman Robert Walker said Trump wants NASA focused on deep space again, not climate science. Talk started about returning to the moon as a first step to Mars. Now, America's government and commercial space workforce waits to see, first, who Trump chooses to lead NASA. That will be a clue to the agency's direction for the next four years. Candidates mentioned for the job include a congressman, Rep. Jim Bridenstine (R-Okla), who favors a return to the moon; former NASA associate administrator Dan Cooke; and former NASA Administrator Mike Griffin. They also like deep space missions. Since the election, the space press has also closely followed the appointments to Trump's NASA transition team. Early reports said Sessions had tilted its makeup toward deep space and the projects NASA in Alabama does best. More recently, advocates for "new space" got Trump's ear and were added to the transition team for "balance." As for Trump, space isn't a priority yet. He tweeted during the campaign that he was "very sad to see what @BarackObama has done with NASA. He has gutted the program and made us dependent on the Russians." That was a reference to NASA having to pay for rides to the space station aboard Russia's Soyuz rocket. But Trump also told a young boy who asked about NASA during a town hall that, "Right now, we have bigger problems - you understand that? We've got to fix our potholes." The agency's future is a question with three parts: What will be its mission under Trump? Who will decide? And who will provide the rockets, probes, and crew quarters for that mission? The first two questions are about national strategy; the third will essentially be a fight over government funding. Here's a fourth question to consider as Trump's NASA plan unfolds. Will a return to the moon, even permanently, excite the young people now dubbed "the Mars generation"? Huntsville attorney Mark McDaniel was on the NASA Advisory Council when George W. Bush was president. He says Bush's old plan might make a good new plan. "I personally think deep space is something the government should do," McDaniel said, noting that the moon is deep space. "We talked about that when I was on the Advisory Council. The key word (in Bush's plan) was 'beyond.' We were going to the moon, Mars and beyond. "If you go back and it's in preparation for going to Mars, an asteroid or beyond Mars, that's great," McDaniel said. "We as a nation have to do things that have never been done before."If you say we're just going back to the moon," McDaniel said, "been there, done that."

By Victoria McGrane Globe Staff  January 03, 2017 WASHINGTON — From the boardroom to the campaign trail, unpredictability has been Donald Trump’s defining trait. Trump’s presidential transition has been similarly marked by unconventional twists and turns. The reality-TV-style auditioning of key Cabinet candidates. Dissonant signals on where he stands on climate change and the use of torture. Twitter blasts at odd hours about the nation’s nuclear arsenal and foreign policy. Kanye. Advertisement His unpredictability — coming after a campaign promise to shake up Washington — is roiling Washington’s lobbyists and intelligentsia, handing those whose business it is to shape the policy-making process in Washington the toughest job they’ve had in decades. “The amount of uncertainty here is just enormous,” said Michael Strain, director of economic policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative-leaning think tank. As the weeks tick down to the president-elect’s inauguration, to a certain extent, he said, “we’re all trying to figure out how to do our jobs.” Get Ground Game in your inbox: Daily updates and analysis on national politics from James Pindell.

So the real estate mogul’s surprise victory sent many lobbyists scrambling to make connections and build relationships with Trump’s close advisers. View Story Trump tweets about N. Korean missiles Donald Trump responded to a North Korean report that it is preparing to launch an ICBM. And scramble they must. He has outlined an ambitious legislative agenda but not been clear on the order of his priorities or policy details. Adding to the unknowns: his incoming administration is not made up of the usual suspects. “He’s completely upended the political establishment,” said one Republican lobbyist with ties to Trump’s inner circle. The people who have had a lock on Washington’s levers of power for the last two decades, many of them alumnus of the Clinton or George W. Bush administrations, are now “outside looking in,” said this lobbyist. Advertisement Little-known rank-and-file lawmakers like Representative Chris Collins of New York, the first member of Congress to endorse Trump who is now serving as the main congressional liaison to Trump’s transition team, are suddenly ascendant power brokers. Meanwhile, Trump — known for prizing loyalty — has complicated relations with many of the GOP elite who were less enthusiastic about his candidacy, including House Speaker Paul Ryan. And then there is Trump himself, the consummate Washington outsider who has never held elected office before storming the highest office in the land. He arrives in Washington with few of the well-established ideological beliefs that typically serve as guideposts to those trying to figure out what a president will do. “President-elect Donald Trump isn’t bound by the same partisan constraints that shackled his predecessors. He won without the explicit backing of many leading Republicans, giving him more flexibility to chart his own course in office,” CGCN Group, a Republican lobbying firm whose major clients include Boeing and Microsoft, wrote to clients in a recent memo on the 2017 outlook. “Public affairs executives must figure out how to adapt to this unpredictably or risk irrelevance.” Trump has been providing observers with a lot of conflicting tea leaves to read. In early December, the president-elect unexpectedly sat down with former vice president and global warming guru Al Gore — a meeting that was initially meant to be just between Gore and Trump’s highly influential daughter Ivanka to discuss “climate issues,” a cause she has hinted she might pursue. Gore emerged from the golden elevators proclaiming the meeting “productive.” A few days later, Trump — who has previously called global warming a “hoax” — tapped a climate change skeptic, Oklahoma attorney general Scott Pruitt, as his nominee to lead the Environmental Protection Agency, a move widely interpreted as a signal Trump wants to roll back climate policies enacted by the Obama administration. On the campaign trail, Trump vowed repeatedly to bring back waterboarding as an interrogation technique for terror suspects, which many critics consider torture. But at the end of November, Trump indicated that a conversation with retired Marine Corps General James Mattis had affected his thinking on the issue, though it remains unclear whether he will seek to revive the banned tactic. Trump ‘won without the explicit backing of many leading Republicans, giving him more flexibility to chart his own course.’ CGCN Group, Republican lobbying firm  “He said, ‘I’ve never found it to be useful,’ ” Trump told The New York Times. “I was very impressed by that answer.” Trump later named Mattis as his pick for defense secretary. Lobbyists point to the waterboarding instance as an example of a Trump’s willingness to turn on a dime with big decisions — or what critics say is his tendency to be swayed by whoever spoke to him last. It also highlights his self-described process of collecting many opinions on key issues, then making a final decision on “gut feeling.” Trump “is more than most presidents . . . influenced by practicality, and how does it move him,” said John Feehery, a Republican strategist and president of QGA Public Affairs, a prominent lobbying and communications firm whose clients include AT&T and US Steel. Feehery and other lobbyists say this increases the importance of crafting the right narrative around issues they are pushing for clients, and on building public support as opposed to working behind-the-scenes connections. Warring power centers have emerged within Trump’s fledgling administration, further complicating efforts to devise what the new administration’s policy priorities will be — since it’s obscuring who will control the agenda. Will it be Trump himself, despite the fact he showed little appetite for policy details during the election? Will it be his adult children? His incoming chief of staff, Reince Priebus? Or maybe Vice President-elect Mike Pence? “I think it’s kind of a jump ball right now,” said Feehery. “There are a lot of minuscule issues that Donald Trump probably doesn’t care about [but] that are very important to some key industries, so people are trying to figure out who’s going to be the decider on those things.” Some things are becoming clearer with time. The American Enterprise Institute’s Strain said Trump’s Cabinet picks telegraph in broad strokes likely policy priorities. His choice of Georgia conservative Tom Price, one of the fiercest critics of the Affordable Care Act, to lead the Health and Human Services Department signals the president-elect is serious about his pledge to repeal that law, said Strain. Likewise, picking Bush administration veteran Elaine Chao, a savvy player of the Washington game, as his nominee to be the next secretary of transportation lends heft to his promise to push a big infrastructure package. But Trump passed over a major critic of the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial regulations when naming his Treasury secretary nominee, suggesting that rolling back that law “is lower on the list of priorities,” said Strain. Still, the actual details of Trump’s proposals remain murkier than usual. George W. Bush campaigned on wanting to enact a big tax cut. When he took office in 2001, “people knew what the basic contours of that were,” said Strain, who was critical of Trump during the campaign. “We do not have that with the president-elect. We do not have a defined starting point” on his tax proposal, among others, he said. Trump has repeatedly sown confusion about his tax plan, most recently when his Treasury secretary pick described features that conflict with the proposal Trump outlined during the campaign. The uncertainty extends beyond Washington’s influence class and think tanks to those charged with steering the economy. Federal Reserve chairwoman Janet Yellen said last month that members of the Fed’s policy-making committee discussed Trump’s economic plans during their most recent meeting in Washington. Their conclusion: “There is considerable uncertainty about how economic policies may change and what effect they will have on the economy,” said Yellen, speaking at a press conference following the Fed’s decision to raise interest rates for only the second time since the 2008 financial crisis. “We’re operating under a cloud of uncertainty at the moment.” The sheer ambition of Trump’s policy agenda adds to the uncertainty, Strain said. Immigration reform, repealing and replacing the health care law, a major tax code overhaul, and new infrastructure spending — each one is a big ticket item that will likely consume healthy amounts of time to negotiate and pass through Congress. And all are likely to be far harder to accomplish than many lawmakers and commentators are currently acknowledging, some observers say. Congressional Republicans are not united in how — and when, and if — to replace the Affordable Care Act. One faction wants to just repeal the law and leave it at that. Others believe Republicans need to replace it with something, but there’s also debate over whether the GOP can pass legislation repealing the measure now but have its demise delayed a few years to buy them time to devise a replacement program. And for many legislative items (though probably not all of the health care law repeal), Senate Republicans will need to gain the support of several Democrats for passage, further complicating matters. The GOP will control 52 Senate seats this year; most bills require a super-majority of 60 votes to succeed. This is where Trump’s reputation for being a deal-maker could come into play, and some insiders are betting that his business background and non-ideological sensibilities will lead him to try to make deals across the aisle. “[D]on’t overlook his ability to forge unconventional alliances,” CGCN, the lobbying firm, advised clients. Still, as the first person to win the presidency with no elected or military experience, how Trump’s business skills will translate in the political context, and how his volatile temperament will respond to the give-and-take of politics, remain two big unknowns. For now, much of Washington is in wait-and-see mode, confident that some of these questions will shake out in the early days of the Trump administration but also bracing for a more tumultuous four years than this town has seen in awhile. For some, it’s a refreshing change. “It’s much more exciting. It’s much more unpredictable. I like that,” said Feehery. “I think we’ve been in an ideological rut that has been very counterproductive. That’s why people have become disgusted with Washington.” Victoria McGrane can be reached at victoria.mcgrane@globe.com. Follow her on Twitter @vgmac. Loading comments...

Later this month, the two companies will reveal the final tally for last year’s orders and deliveries, but both look set to fall short of their goal of achieving a book to bill of about one — essentially replacing almost every aircraft delivery with a new order. This would be the first time since 2009 that either aircraft maker has fallen below the threshold of one, according to aerospace analyst Rob Stallard of Vertical Research Partners. Quotes in the article Boeing Co BOE ▼ 158.61 -0.16 -0.10% “Airline demand indicators are easing,” he said in a recent note to clients. “We could be near or past the peak in this upcycle.” Neither company is including the recent multibillion-dollar orders from IranAir as firm sales, although contracts were signed in mid-December. By December 20, Boeing had 470 orders net of cancellations, against expected deliveries of about 750 aircraft. This compares with 868 net orders in 2015 and 762 deliveries. Airbus had net orders of 410 at the end of November, against 1,185 in 2015, with an order for five more A320 single aisle aircraft announced last month. It had delivered 577 aircraft by the end of November, against a goal of 670 and 635 in 2015. On a brighter note, a late December push will bring Airbus very close to its 2016 target of delivering 50 of its newest twin aisle, the A350 mid-range jet. Having delivered 34 by the end of November, the company is expected to have delivered 48-49 of the passenger jets by December 31, according to Sandy Morris, aerospace analyst at Jefferies, the investment bank. The impact of missing the A350 delivery target will be minimal, he said. “You can say they missed the delivery target or you can look at it and say the A350 has gone into service with six or seven airlines and it seems to be performing absolutely fine,” he said. “That is the most important thing.”© Bloomberg An Airbus SE A350 XWB passenger jet at the China International Aviation & Aerospace Exhibition in Zhuhai, China Deliveries of the A350 were held up earlier this year because of difficulties with French cabin supplier Zodiac. However one big Airbus supplier said the problems with lavatory doors and passenger seats appeared to have been overcome by early December and management at the aircraft maker’s Toulouse headquarters were “sounding pretty bullish”. The group is also struggling to catch up on deliveries of its new A320neo aircraft, after difficulties with engine supplier Pratt & Whitney, and has had to step up deliveries of its existing generation A320 to compensate. While deliveries are expected to accelerate in 2017, the industry is preparing for a slowdown in orders as airlines adjust to rising oil prices and a deceleration of passenger traffic growth. Iata, the airline industry lobby group, is forecasting traffic in 2017 to slow from this year’s 5.9 to 5.1 per cent, while capacity is still showing signs of growing more quickly at 5.6 per cent. However, this is still a slowdown on 2016’s 6.2 per cent expansion. The rate of deferrals and cancellations also appears to be picking up. United Continental announced last month that it would defer 61 Boeing 737 deliveries from 2017-2018 while Southwest has also pushed back delivery of more than 60 737 single-aisle jets. If enough airlines follow suit, this could have an impact on longer-term profit expectations for Boeing and Airbus.

ISIS and U.S. generals Nov. 12, 2015: "I know more about ISIS than the generals do." Sept. 7, 2016: "I will ask my generals to present to me a plan within 30 days to defeat and destroy ISIS." Nuclear warfare Sept. 26, 2016 (debate): "I would certainly not do first strike." Sept. 26, 2016 (same debate): "I can't take anything off the table." Climate change Sept. 24, 2015 (tweet): "The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing noncompetitive." May 17, 2016: "At a minimum I will be renegotiating those agreements, at a minimum. And at a maximum I may do something else," Trump said in regards to the Paris Agreement on climate change. Nov. 22, 2016: "I think there is some connectivity" between humans and climate change, he told the New York Times. As for the Paris Agreement, he said, "I have an open mind to it." Abortion Oct. 24, 1999: On Meet the Press, Trump said he was "very pro-choice." March 30, 2016: When MSNBC pressed him on his current opposition to abortion rights and what should be done to women if they disregard some future abortion ban, he said the "answer is that there has to be some form of punishment" to the women. March 30, 2016: Less than two hours after the above statement, Trump said the person who performed the illegal abortion "would be held responsible, not the woman." Prosecute Hillary Clinton Oct. 9, 2016 (debate): "If I win, I am going to instruct my attorney general to get a special prosecutor to look into your situation." Nov. 22, 2016: "I don't want to hurt the Clintons. I really don't. She went through a lot. And suffered greatly in many different ways." If you struggle to get a handle on some of President-elect Donald Trump's comments, here's a hint: Don't take him literally. Sometimes Trump shoots from the hip, before he's thought things through. Sometimes, at least during the campaign, he'd repeat lines that roused the crowd. And there’s a growing perception that sometimes, he's doing what he’s spent his career doing – being a negotiator, not a typical politician whose words you take at face value. "Part of what he may be doing at times is taking a hardline negotiating position as a starting point," said UC Irvine political scientist Carole Uhlaner. Initial policy stances on undocumented immigrants and Muslims entering the country, both of which have softened in recent months, may have served as such starting points. "Also, people not knowing when to take you seriously can be an advantage," she said. Republican National Committeeman Shawn Steel said fellow committee members have been discussing how to interpret Trump’s comments for more than a year. He agreed that the president-elect is essentially a negotiator. “It’s a different way of statecraft,” the Surfside resident said, adding that Trump’s tweets are about tone rather than precision. “The media has taken him literally, but they never took him seriously,” he said. “The voters took him seriously, but not literally. They didn’t expect a 40-foot wall for 3000 miles along the border. It was symbolic. ... It’s what he actually does that matters to me.” Steel said Trump’s controversial call with the Taiwanese president – which drew criticism from China – was a “masterful” shot over the bow that may be the prelude to a better trade deal. But other Trump comments are clearly not strategic policy ploys. In March, an interviewer described a scenario in which abortion was outlawed and asked Trump what should be done with women who had abortions anyway. Trump said they should be punished – but within two hours, backpedaled and said it was the abortionists who should be penalized. Then there are instances where he appears to say things simply for effect. His campaign vow to hire a special prosecutor to go after Hillary Clinton – which frequently led to the “Lock her up” chant popular at rallies – is something he walked away from once elected. “He says what he thinks will get a good response from whoever he’s talking to,” said Raphael Sonenshein, executive director of the Pat Brown Institute for Public Affairs at Cal State Los Angeles. Sonenshein agrees with Steel that it’s Trump’s actions rather than his words that people should be paying attention to. “I don’t think he takes his own words seriously,’ Sonenshein said. “To me, it’s a whole lot of work to figure out what he means when it might just be a passing thought.” LEFT VS. RIGHT Many Democrats are alarmed by both the policy and style of the president elect, even while they question if he has any core beliefs. Howard Katz, chairman of the Democratic Party of Riverside County, is among those. He dismisses the notion that the skills of a business negotiator are transferable to politics and diplomacy, especially when it comes to staking out extreme starting points. “The problem with those extreme positions with an adversary is that it might end negotiations right away,” said Katz, who spent 30 years with IBM, including a stint negotiating to site factories abroad. “Business and diplomacy are far different from one another. Diplomacy is about consensus and business is cutthroat.” While Trump differs from his predecessors in that he has no governmental or military experience, Katz said the president elect is no different from others in terms of needing to catch up on many aspects of the office. “But every other man I’ve seen take the job has been humble enough not to say, ‘I know better than everybody else. I know better than the generals. I don’t need daily briefings,’” Katz said. Katz disagrees that Trump’s call with the Taiwanese president was a wise move, saying such behavior could result in China shifting its orders for jets from Boeing to the European Airbus consortium. Over the next 20 years, China is expected to buy $1 trillion worth of Boeing aircraft, and in 2016 ordered 163 jets costing $11 billion, according the CNN. Boeing has estimated the China orders support 150,000 jobs. Katz also criticizes Trump’s tweet that “the United States must greatly strengthen and expand its nuclear capability,” saying it could lead to an arms race. “I think we should be extremely concerned by his spontaneity,” he said. “You may end up inciting people to violence that you cannot contain.” But Republican John Cruz applauded that Trump tweet, noting that it came just hours after Russian President Vladimir Putin had said he would enhance his country’s nuclear forces. “That was Trump telling Putin, ‘You don’t want to go there – we’re not going to be at a disadvantage,’” the San Clemente lawyer said. “I think he sent just the right message. I think leaders would be much less likely to challenge the U.S. because of his posture and tone.” Cruz, who supports a path to legalization for those in the country illegally, was initially favoring the presidential candidacies of Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio. But he cast his ballot for Trump and says he has become more “comfortable and confident” with the president elect since the election, thanks to his tone becoming “more measured and presidential.” EVOLVING VIEWS Cruz likes the direction Trump seems to be taking in terms of those in the country without documents, signaling that the president elect is apparently moving away from his initial plan to deport all 11 million. Trump has also made comments about visas for Muslims, climate change and the use of torture that also indicate he may be evolving to softer positions than those touted in the primaries. “I do get the feeling that he’s moderating on some things,” said Jodi Balma, a political scientist at Fullerton College. “But I don’t know what he’s going to do. I don’t know how his decision-making process works.” Fellow political scientist Uhlaner understands the struggle to make sense of Trump’s statements. “He doesn’t filter his comments the way leaders usually do and until he does, it would be a mistake to take every comment equally seriously,” she said. “If he were to put himself in a position where there were questions and answers, it would be a lot easier to understand exactly what he meant. “Instead, we’re left to read the tea leaves of his tweets.” Contact the writer: mwisckol@ocregister.com Related Links Lansner: Will Trump help the economy? 17 trends to watch in 2017 Trump adopting same behavior he criticized Clinton for Gingrich: Trump's ditching 'drain the swamp' Trump says he'll shutter foundation to avoid 'appearance of conflict' Digital & Driveway Delivery - 50% Off Most Popular 4-year-old Irvine boy killed in car accident Update: 5 people shot in Santa Ana on Saturday night Runners pay tribute to Carrie Fisher in Star Wars Half Marathon at Disneyland Surfer pulled unconscious from water at Bolsa Chica State Beach, later dies 4 men injured in 3 unrelated Santa Ana shootings Related Links Lansner: Will Trump help the economy? 17 trends to watch in 2017 Trump adopting same behavior he criticized Clinton for Gingrich: Trump's ditching 'drain the swamp' Trump says he'll shutter foundation to avoid 'appearance of conflict' User Agreement Comments are encouraged, but you must follow our Privacy Policy Policy & Terms of Use Keep it civil and stay on topic.

 This app will send you alerts when Donald Trump tweets about stocks you own Nathan McAlone Jan. 4, 2017, 6:30 PM 12,123 facebook linkedin twitter email print Donald Trump. Carlo Allegri/Reuters When President-elect Donald Trump tweets about a public company, the market listens.  And if you hold the stock of one of the companies that has come into Trump's crosshairs, finance app Trigger thinks you'll want to know about it. The free iPhone app works by letting you set up financial "triggers," which you can then use to guide your investment decisions. For example, you can set a reminder to sell a stock when its price reaches a certain level, moves a specific percentage, hits a one-year low or high, and so on. When the condition occurs, Trigger sends you a notification, and you can decide whether to act on it. Now the company has rolled out a special "Trump trigger." The trigger "gives you the ability to trade stocks based off of Trump’s tweets about public companies," the startup wrote. Basically, the trigger works by notifying you if Trump tweets about a publicly traded stock that you own, in real time. Trump has tweeted about companies from Apple to Amazon to AT&T — and that's just the A's. In some cases, such as when Trump blasted Boeing for the cost of a new Air Force One jet, the aerospace company's stock immediately fell nearly 2%. Should this pattern continue during Trump's presidency, it's not difficult to see why investors might want to be quickly alerted to tweets about their holdings.  Trigger Trigger characterized the Trump trigger as the first step toward the startup using "not just price based data but relevant world events to condense into simple IF this, THEN that rules." Expect a bunch of varied types of financial signals in the future. If the idea of setting up these types of notifications for your investments intrigues you, check out Trigger's website, or its iPhone app. Visit Markets Insider for constantly updated market quotes for individual stocks, ETFs, indices, commodities and currencies traded around the world.

If he targets trade with China, that’s a major trading partner for Wisconsin. By Bruce Thompson - Jan 4th, 2017 01:40 pm Sign-up for the Urban Milwaukee daily email Donald Trump. Image from campaign website. Donald Trump owes his election to former Obama supporters distressed by the economic decline of their communities. Trump was able to channel this concern, particularly in rural and smaller urban areas, into a promise to reverse globalization. Mainstream economics has long accepted the proposition that trade benefits both parties. But even if society as a whole benefits, the gains are not evenly distributed; trade makes winners and losers. Those whose jobs were lost to cheaper imports will not be impressed by arguments that the society as a whole is better off. Branko Milanovic, formerly chief economist for the World Bank, analyzed the change in global income over 20 years as compared to people’s income at the start of the period. He found that most of the gains in income were enjoyed by two groups of people: (1)those who moved into the middle class in emerging third world countries, such as China, Vietnam, India, and Indonesia and (2)the super-rich. By contrast middle class people in the US, Europe, and other rich countries saw little gain. The resulting graph (taken from Quartz) sometimes called the “elephant chart” because of its shape, is shown below. Percentile distribution of global real income growth, 1988-2008 The political implications of globalization, and particularly Chinese imports to the US, were explored by economists David Autor, David Dorn, Gordon Hanson, and Kaveh Majlesi. They examined increased polarization in congressional elections. In an article published in September 2016, they concluded: Analyzing outcomes from the 2002 and 2010 congressional elections, we detect an ideological realignment that is centered in trade-exposed local labor markets and that commences prior to the divisive 2016 U.S. presidential election. In a post-election supplement, they conclude: A counterfactual study of closely contested states suggests that Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and North Carolina would have elected the Democrat instead of the Republican candidate if, ceteris paribus, the growth in Chinese import penetration had been 50 percent lower than the actual growth during the period of analysis. The Democrat candidate would also have obtained a majority in the electoral college in this counterfactual scenario. If “Chinese import gains between 2002 and 2014 were 25 percent smaller Donald Trump would have lost Wisconsin by 1.7 percent instead of winning it by 0.8 percent.” Other economists argue that automation has had a much larger role than China in destroying jobs. They point out that, contrary to Trump’s claims, US industrial output has increased even as employment has declined over many years. One reason many smaller towns are in trouble is that they were originally established to serve the needs of farmers. But technology has allowed farms to employ far fewer people while increasing their output. Farms have grown bigger and more mechanized, becoming multi-million dollar businesses. Towns, built to serve the surrounding farming community, find they no longer have the customer base they need, resulting in the loss of businesses, their school, and ultimately many of their young people. Ironically, Trump’s nominee for Labor Secretary, the fast-food CEO Andy Puzder, made the argument for why businesses prefer machines to people: machines are “always polite, they always upsell, they never take a vacation, they never show up late, there’s never a slip-and-fall, or an age, sex, or race discrimination case.” It is likely technology will continue to destroy jobs. For example, think of the push to develop self-driving vehicles. One labor market growth area recently has been for truck drivers. If self-driving trucks become viable, what happens to this market? Although Trump owes his election to the losers in the evolving economy, he is staffing his administration with the winners, the super-rich. While some very rich people recognize that they are the beneficiary of luck and show compassion for those less fortunate, Trump’s picks are not among them, according to an article by Ray Diulio. Here is his description of the culture of the emerging Trump administration: Regarding economics, if you haven’t read Ayn Rand lately, I suggest that you do as her books pretty well capture the mindset. This new administration hates weak, unproductive, socialist people and policies, and it admires strong, can-do, profit makers. It wants to, and probably will, shift the environment from one that makes profit makers villains with limited power to one that makes them heroes with significant power. Diulio should know the type. The founder of the Bridgewater money management firm, he is a multi-billionaire himself. The Trump supporters were remarkably loyal to Trump, and willing to overlook the many risks that came with his election. Following Trump’s victory, there was a spate of articles profiling Trump voters panicked that they would lose their health insurance through Obamacare. They seemed to be hoping that, in this case, Trump didn’t mean what he said. That’s not the only area where the Trump victory represents a potential threat to the welfare of his supporters. Although he promised to protect Social Security and Medicare, that has not stopped him from appointing people who have a long record of advocating cuts to these programs. And the Medicaid expansion that came with Obamacare is another example of a program whose ending would disproportionately affect areas that supported Trump. Why were the Trump supporters willing to overlook these threats to their welfare? My guess is that Trump’s promise to crack down on Chinese imports dominated every other consideration for his supporters. From their viewpoint, they have a deal: Trump will follow through on his promise to crack down on Chinese imports. Trump’s ability to read audiences and say what they want to hear makes it hard to predict what policies his administration will follow on most issues. However, to back out of the promised crack-down on Chinese imports would be especially costly because it would be a betrayal of his supporters. Thus, it seems safe to assume there will be a turn to protectionism. One plan under consideration by the Trump team is an across-the-board 10 percent tariff on imports. Presumably many of our trading partners would apply similar tariffs on imports from America. As a result, America would likely import less, but also export less. Another approach tries to be more selective. Particular imports from China might be targeted—for examples, browse the shelves of Walmart. The Chinese in turn are likely to put tariffs on selective American products—such as airplanes from Boeing—where China is a rich market for the U.S. The US Census Bureau issues annual reports on exports and imports for each state. For Wisconsin the two are in rough balance, as shown below. 2015 Wisconsin Imports and Exports The Census Bureau also lists the 25 top trading partners. As shown below, the top three for both imports and exports are China, Canada, and Mexico (the numbers on the bars show the rank), although China exports a lot more than it buys and Canada imports well more than it sells. Wisconsin Imports and Exports The bureau also lists the top 25 products exported and imported. Here, the lists are quite different. Wisconsin’s exports are heavy on mechanical equipment (although the top export is adrenal cortical hormones). By contrast, many of the imports are things likely to show up in Wal-Mart. About a quarter of the value of the top 25 imports are clothing, fabrics, and footwear. Wisconsinites could be paying more for these items while its manufacturers lose business in China. Could that hurt manufacturing employment here? But it’s not that simple. A number of the items on both lists are parts likely to be incorporated into other products. Thus a tariff could make a variety of American and Chinese products less competitive. Increased world trade has disrupted many communities as supply chains are continually redesigned. Trying to undo globalization could be equally disruptive, redesigning supply chains once again. Some firms—and their employees—will benefit; others will lose out. Trying to target protectionism so that only workers in some states benefit (say, Rust Belt economies of Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Ohio) could be very difficult to do. And even if it could, it opens the door to complaints from other states. Politically, in my view, Trump has to follow through on his commitment to reverse globalization. The result, however, seems unlikely to benefit those who put their faith in him. More broadly, the administration that is emerging is one that shows remarkable disdain for the people who put them in power. Data Wonk 5 Issues Democrats Must Face Jan 11th, 2017 by Bruce Thompson 2016 Election Results Prove Gerrymandering Dec 28th, 2016 by Bruce Thompson What Do Trump’s Voters Want? Dec 21st, 2016 by Bruce Thompson Categories: Business, Data Wonk 12 thoughts on “Data Wonk: How Will Trumponomics Impact State?” Jason says: January 4, 2017 at 6:30 pm Ayn Rand cheap shot, really. The Trumpist are with out compassion. How do you solve the crisis in social security disability. Under Obama, our country went from 5 million on disability to 10 million as Obama leaves office. As a liberal Bruce Thompson you suggest it can not be reformed. To do so would be heartless, so since the disability funding is insolvent it seems we just combine the problem with another insolvent problem, Social Security. 12.5 percent of every worker’s check in America goes to Social Security and still the program is insolvent. The liberal argument is always more taxation on the working people because that is compassion. Tell that to the veterans promised reliable and speedy government health care at the Veterans Affairs hospitals. Vincent Hanna says: January 4, 2017 at 9:04 pm Is it a cheap shot because it’s true and the truth hurts? Liberals are always calling for an increase on taxes for working people? That isn’t true at all. They are calling for more taxes on the rich. Jason says: January 4, 2017 at 10:56 pm Vince I hope part of your dream comes true. California has a 13 6 percent state tax on the wealthy and a 7.5 percent sales tax. I hope the weak and unproductive keep voting to push businesses and citizens out of that utopia. Rich says: January 4, 2017 at 11:11 pm You should check the definition of “insolvent” before continuing to throw that word around. “Insolvent” implies a present condition, which is not a true statement for Social Security. One of its synonyms, “overleveraged”, is probably more appropriate, but oh-so-less-headline-y. The “cheap shot” is actually in Jason’s response, trying to tie certain policies to “compassion”, as if the political leanings are on completely opposite ends of that spectrum. Since people aren’t just going to magically go away, those with less will continue to be an externality to everyone else’s economic equations — hidden taxes to society. The uber-rich will of course will be able to avoid it and look the other way, but the costs will catch up with the rest of us, maybe in just crime and the prison-industrial complex alone. So, it’s not a “I / You care more about poor people than you / I do” argument…keep your “conservative” hat on, keep with the spirit of Data Wonk columns and consider the economics — Maybe, just maybe, “socialist” things like Social Security and other programs work out for the betterment of society in the end. Vincent Hanna says: January 5, 2017 at 7:33 am And again he doesn’t answer direct questions and puts words in my mouth. You are the worst kind of troll Jason. You also continually get things wrong, but you are post-truth like your hero Trump so you don’t care. Liberals don’t want to raise taxes on working people despite your claim, which you probably know isn’t true but again you don’t care. And California’s economy is strong and thriving. It’s in much better shape than Wisconsin’s. If California’s a ‘bad state for business,’ why is it leading the nation in job and GDP growth? http://www.latimes.com/business/hiltzik/la-fi-hiltzik-california-econ-growth-20160722-snap-story.html You are a deplorable Jason, which I’m sure you’re proud of. How can we chase you away? We’re better off without people like you. Vincent Hanna says: January 5, 2017 at 9:40 am They are talking about this on NPR right now. Experts from across the political spectrum agree that Trump’s methods will not work because he can’t stop or change global trends or economic principles. Obviously companies are most concerned with profits and business decisions that benefit their organization. If they are going to be punished for moving production abroad, they will adjust and move to invest in technology and automate more jobs in the U.S. Carrier and other companies have already said they are doing this or planning to do it. More automation means less jobs. Trump can’t stop that. blurondo says: January 5, 2017 at 9:43 am If a government action does not benefit the common good, it should never be enacted. This standard began with the founding fathers. Neither Trump nor his billionaire appointees believe in the common good. Tom D says: January 5, 2017 at 12:31 pm Jason lies in post 1 when he says that people collecting Social Security disability doubled (from 5 million to 10 million) under Obama. Here are those numbers for Obama’s first 7 years: Social Security Disability recipients on 12/31/2008: 9 million Social Security Disability recipients on 12/31/2015: 11 million Both numbers include disabled workers and their dependents sources: 2009 and 2016 Social Security annual trustee reports (Page 10 on each report.) Mike Carey says: January 5, 2017 at 12:48 pm The Ayn Rand is an appropriate example. If you don’t believe so explain why. There has been plenty of discussion on the influence her fictional writing has had on gop leadership. If you don’t agree, then explain yourself. On other issues raised, the SS system would be an easy fix. 1. Designate the money collected by SS be spent only on that program. Lets quit siphoning off funds to other programs or loans. 2. Lift the cap on taxes from $118,500. Clearly the bulk of earnings has been made by the wealthy in this country. Time for them to pay taxes on 100% of their earnings like almost everyone else. This helps reverse the trend that most earnings have gone to the wealthy and helps stabilize the program. Anothereasy savings would be to hold the military accountable for the funds they receive. They can’t account for trillions over the last 15 years. Republicans are always quick to say you can’t throw money at a problem, if its Education or a social program, but willingly throw billions of dollars away on the military which can’t keep track of it. Until they can acount for the money they are given, no increases. Tom D says: January 5, 2017 at 12:57 pm In post 1, Jason says “12.5 percent of every worker’s check in America goes to Social Security and still the program is insolvent.” Jason is wrong again. First the percentage is 12.4% (not 12.5%) and that only applies to poor and middle-class workers, not all workers. Rich people (anybody making over $127,200 in 2017) pay less than 12.4%. For example, if you make $250,000 this year, you (and your employer) only pay a total of 6.31% instead of the normal 12.4%. If every worker, rich and poor alike, actually paid 12.4%, Social Security would be fine. Tom D says: January 5, 2017 at 1:41 pm Mike Carey (post 9), you say we should “Designate the money collected by SS be spent only on that program.” That’s already true. Over 99% of Social Security spending goes into benefits; the balance is Social Security’s administrative costs (incurred disproportionately on disability benefits, not for old-age pensions). Lending Social Security’s annual surpluses to the federal government (buying Treasury notes, bills, and bonds) is the best option available. (What else could they do? Stockpile $100 bills? Buy gold?) Yes, that money is spent by the feds, but the alternative is having Washington borrow even more from others (including China). I also point out that, when you buy US Savings Bonds (or a bank CD), your money is immediately spent by others. As long as the Tea Party crazies don’t take over Washington (and default on the US debt), the Social Security trust fund assets are real and collectable when needed. If the Tea Party crazies do take over and default on the debt, then every insurance company and bank will also go belly-up, and FDIC insurance will be worthless (because the FDIC’s reserves are 100% invested in Treasury debt). Thomas says: January 6, 2017 at 12:16 am Thanks, Tom D, for factual information re social security in posts 8 & 10, and for reasonable inferences from facts. If everybody in this country paid 12.4% of their income into social security, that program would be solvent for longer than most of us will live. Had W had his way in 2005 – when he promoted partial privatization of social security, the GREAT RECESSION of 2007-2009 could have decimated the program. Paul Ryan and other fans of Ayn Rand are talking again about social security like W used to … Let’s not let that loser dog anywhere near this hunt.

The space agency hopes the missions will help better understand one of the earliest phases of our solar system (less than 10 million years after the birth of our sun). Lucy will launch in October 2021 and will visit the Trojan asteroids that circulate around Jupiter, while Psyche, which will launch in 2023, will study a unique metal asteroid, NASA says. Lucy Lucy, a robotic spacecraft, will launch in October 2021 and is expected to arrive at a main belt asteroid in 2025. Lucy will then explore six Trojan asteroids from 2027 to 2033. The objects, which are trapped by the Jupiter’s gravity, are thought to be relics of the earliest days of the solar system. The objects may have even formed far beyond Jupiter’s current orbit, NASA says. “This is a unique opportunity,” said Harold F. Levison, principal investigator of the Lucy mission. “Because the Trojans are remnants of the primordial material that formed the outer planets, they hold vital clues to deciphering the history of the solar system.” Psyche The Psyche mission will focus on a massive metal asteroid, known as 16 Psych, which is about three times further away from the sun than Earth is. The object, which measures an estimated 130 miles in diameter, is unique because it is made up of mostly of metallic iron and nickel, similar to our planet’s core, as opposed to other asteroids that have rocky or icy bodies. Related Stories SpaceX, Boeing Win NASA Contracts For Crewed ISS Missions NASA To Resume Testing Of James Webb Telescope Scientists hope the Psyche mission will help better comprehend how planets and other objects separated into their layers, including cores, mantles and crusts, early in their histories. “This is an opportunity to explore a new type of world – not one of rock or ice, but of metal,” said Psyche principal investigator Lindy Elkins-Tanton. “16 Psyche is the only known object of its kind in the solar system, and this is the only way humans will ever visit a core. We learn about inner space by visiting outer space.” Psyche, which is also a robotic mission, will launch in October 2023 and will arrive on the unique metal asteroid in 2030. The missions were picked from five proposals through NASA’s Discovery Program. The projects in that program are shorter and are relatively low-cost, with their development capped at around $450 million.

By David Bach, contributor - 01/04/17 04:00 PM EST 5   © Bloomberg/Getty Images Back in September, Ford Motor CEO Mark Fields vehemently denied allegations by then-candidate Donald TrumpDonald TrumpTrump’s healthcare plan will offer ‘insurance for everybody’: report Trump on outgoing CIA director: ‘Was this the leaker of Fake News?’ What Obama will do after his presidency? Sleep. MORE that the second-largest U.S. automaker planned to fire employees in America to expand its production in Mexico. Calling Trump’s allegations “completely wrong,” Fields stressed that Ford’s plans to hire 2,800 workers in Mexico and shift production of smaller vehicles across the border—while necessary to ensure competitive prices for U.S. consumers—would not result in job losses in Michigan since workers there would make larger and more expensive vehicles instead. Having been one of the few CEOs to strongly push back against candidate Trump’s populist attacks on U.S. companies (“It's really unfortunate when politics get in the way of the facts,” Fields said then), his announcement this week that Ford had scrapped its Mexico expansion plans and would instead create 700 new jobs in the United States. raised eyebrows from Washington to Wall Street. Has Ford suddenly discovered a new love of country? Has Trump set off an irresistible patriotic impulse across C-suites? The short answer is no. Then as now, Ford was and is driven by a focus on what it believes best for its shareholders. After the company had placed a big bet on making smaller, more fuel efficient cars in the United States, falling gas prices depressed demand and eventually led to plans to shift production to Mexico in an effort to trim costs. Demand for small fuel efficient cars is unlikely to suddenly spike under a Trump administration, and the mere possibility of a renegotiated North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) suggests that spending $1.6 billion on a new Mexican plant now is not in shareholders’ best interest. This is just business. As Fields explained, “We didn’t need [the Mexican factory] anymore. We just don’t need the capacity anymore given the demand for small cars.” ADVERTISEMENT What is noteworthy, however, is how artfully Fields has sought to turn a straightforward business decision into political capital with the new boss in town. Most CEOs don’t call the president-elect and the vice president-elect to tell them about a plan to create 700 jobs, but that is exactly what Fields did before going public. Even though he did not hide the market rationale, he added, “We are encouraged by the pro-growth plans that President-elect Trump and the new Congress indicate they will pursue.” Fields thus deliberately played into Trump’s own narrative that his mere election is bringing jobs back to the United States. In fact, this was exactly the same tune played by Sprint when it announced in late December that it would bring 5,000 jobs back to the United States. “We are excited to work with President-elect Trump and his administration to do our part to drive economic growth and create jobs in the U.S.,” Sprint CEO Marcelo Claure said last week. “We believe it is critical for business and government to partner together to create more job opportunities in the U.S. and ensure prosperity for all Americans.” Naturally, Trump immediately claimed credit, proclaiming that "because of what's happening and the spirit and the hope, I was just called by the head people at Sprint and they're going to be bringing 5,000 jobs back to the United States and taking them from other countries.” What was predictably missing from the announcement yet surprisingly also from most media coverage was Sprint’s and its owner Softbank’s interest in currying favors with Team Trump. In 2014, the Obama administration rebuffed Sprint’s plans to merge with T-Mobile. Yet according to Forbes, “Marcelo Claure, Sprint’s CEO and Masayoshi Son, the head of its parent Softbank, have previously indicated that they could re-look at the possibility of a deal, if the election brought about changes to the regulatory environment.” A pattern seems to be emerging. When companies’ business interests converge with Trump’s political interests, each has an incentive to make the other look good. While Democrats have pledged to deny Trump a honeymoon, he may well get one courtesy of U.S. business. Trump’s attacks on Carrier, Boeing and most recently (and quite ironically in light of the Ford announcement) GM, have shown CEOs the potential costs of crossing the Twitterer-in-Chief. Ford and Sprint now illustrate the benefits of providing Trump with ostensible quick wins. Expect to see more of the latter in the days and weeks ahead. Yet honeymoons don’t last forever. For one, to say that Trump is prone to changing his views quickly and without prior warning would be an understatement. Making business decision with an eye toward delighting the soon-to-be occupant of the Oval Office thus carries a big risk. More importantly, the interests of major U.S. companies (and their shareholders) and those of the Trump administration are likely to diverge before long. An Obamacare repeal-and-delay might be a winning strategy for the midterms, but prolonged uncertainty will unnerve business. For every company hoping to benefit from an infrastructure spending spree, there will be 10 concerned about a ballooning deficit. While many CEOs might enjoy some praise from the White House, most don’t want the government to pick winners and losers. And virtually without exception, U.S. business leaders shudder at the thought of a trade war with China, Mexico or other key trading partners. How Trump responds when business begins to oppose him, and how CEOs will navigate the increasingly complex political terrain, are among the most critical questions of the next four years. David Bach is senior associate dean and professor in the practice of management at the Yale School of Management, where his research and teaching focus on business-government relations, nonmarket strategy and global market regulation.

Now, it’s time for CEOs to study up. The incoming president has upset a few boardrooms by criticizing companies such as Ford (F), General Motors (GM), Carrier and other manufacturers that move US jobs overseas, or build products in low-cost countries to sell in the United States. Trump’s crusades have come full-circle in a few cases: Ford, for instance, just announced a new investment in Michigan, partly in response to Trump’s entreaties. Carrier modified plans to close an Indiana factory and move the whole thing to Mexico, and will now keep some of those jobs in Indiana. The pattern Trump is establishing sheds light on how he’s likely to impose broader policies meant to bring back jobs from overseas or create new ones, and even renegotiate crucial trade deals. Trump doesn’t always get everything he wants. But he settles for outcomes that look like a win. Here’s the template for Trump’s dealmaking on jobs: Phase 1: The attack. It’s usually a tweet, calling out an American company for building products overseas that it sells in the United States. It doesn’t seem to bother Trump if US companies build stuff overseas and sell it there as well. And so far, he hasn’t gone after any foreign companies that import to the US. American companies that sell to Americans and could seemingly employ more Americans are his principal targets. Trump doesn’t appear to be systematic in terms of the companies he targets; there’s no reason to think there’s a detailed list of offending companies he’s working through, one at a time. More likely, he spots something in the news about offshoring or foreign production, and responds spontaneously. Up till now, most CEOs of targeted companies never saw it coming. Phase 2: The follow-through. Trump has complained about some companies, then dropped it. He urged a boycott of Apple (AAPL) last year, for instance, when it fought an FBI request to unlock the iPhone belonging to a terrorism suspect. But nothing came of that criticism. Trump has also complained about Amazon (AMZN) CEO Jeff Bezos, who owns the Washington Post, which published numerous unflattering stories on Trump during last year’s campaign. Again, nothing has happened (so far). Some companies have battle-ready CEOs and strong reputations that even Trump can’t puncture. Trump seems to know when he’s outmatched, and it’s prudent to fold. Trump kept up his screeds against Ford and Carrier, by contrast, expanding on his critical tweets in speeches and media appearances. In those cases, Trump arguably had a PR edge because neither is a beloved institution that inspires loyalty among millions of consumers. Trump knew they were vulnerable to negative publicity, and exploited the opening. Phase 3: The threat. Trump has threatened Boeing (BA) with canceling defense contracts if it doesn’t reduce costs for the next version of Air Force One. He hinted that United Technologies (UTX), Carrier’s parent company, could also lose defense contracts if the company didn’t budge on the Indiana relocation. And he’s gotten automakers’ attention by threatening to withdraw from the North American Free Trade Agreement, which would upend supply chains for virtually every big car company. This is the stage at which CEOs of vulnerable companies need to engage with Trump and seek a deal. Phase 4: The compromise. Companies that have negotiated with Trump have been fairly shrewd. Carrier said it would keep 1,100 jobs in Indiana instead of moving them to Mexico, in exchange for $7 million in new tax incentives from the state. But it still plans to move 1,300 other jobs from Indiana to Mexico, and possibly more. And the CEO of Carrier’s parent company said keeping those jobs in Indiana—for the time being—would force Carrier to find new ways to automate the work, to save money. Ford, likewise, made no change to its plan to relocate production of its Focus subcompact from Michigan to Mexico, which is what incensed Trump in the first place. Instead, the automaker canceled plans to open a new factory in Mexico, saying the two it already operates there provide enough capacity for the production it has planned. At the same time, Ford announced a new investment in Michigan that will create 700 new jobs. If you didn’t bother to parse the details, you could easily walk away thinking Ford is killing production in Mexico and moving it to Michigan. Nope. One test case that hasn’t been resolved yet is Rexnord (RXN), which Trump criticized for its own plan to move 300 jobs from Indiana to Mexico. Unlike Carrier, Rexnord has held firm, announcing no change to its plan. Will Trump back down? Or will he pursue punitive measures against the company once he’s in office? A lot of CEOs are assuredly watching. Phase 5: The declaration of victory. Trump bends when given an opportunity to claim a win and move on—even if he doesn’t really get what he asked for. The Ford move was good enough for Trump to tweet his approval: Thank you to Ford for scrapping a new plant in Mexico and creating 700 new jobs in the U.S. This is just the beginning – much more to follow — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 4, 2017 And here’s how he praised Carrier after it agreed to keep some jobs in Indiana (and before the CEO made that comment about automation): Big day on Thursday for Indiana and the great workers of that wonderful state.We will keep our companies and jobs in the U.S. Thanks Carrier — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 30, 2016 So here’s the lesson for CEOs who find themselves in Trump’s crosshairs: Defend your company. Gauge who’s likely to win the PR war. And if you must, make a measured battlefield concession that will get Trump off your case. Then you can both declare victory.

The Blue Angels are expected to fly over Huntington Beach on Jan. 12. (File photo by Rob O'Neal, Florida Keys News Bureau) By GREG MELLEN / STAFF WRITER Facebook Twitter Email Comments PRINT SEND PDF An F/A 18 from the famed Blue Angels U.S. Navy flying team will be passing over Huntington Beach and the pier area between 9:30 and 10 a.m., Thursday, Jan. 12 as part of their preparations for the 2017 Breitling Huntington Beach Airshow, Sept. 29-Oct. 1. The Blue Angels plane, piloted by Brandon Hempler and Dave Steppe, respectively, will be conducting a flight survey and technical evaluation of the airspace. Hempler, 32, and Steppe, 31, were announced as members of the demonstration flying team in July. The Blue Angels will be one of the headline acts in the second HB Airshow along with the Royal Canadian Air Force Snowbirds. The inaugural show with the USAF Thunderbirds drew estimated crowds of more than 500,000 to the free weekend shows. “The Huntington Beach Airshow is honored and excited to host two of the world’s premier military jet demonstration teams,” said Michael McCabe, the airshow director, in a statement when the show was announced in December at International Council of Airshows Convention in Las Vegas. “Their spectacular demonstrations will thrill the young and young at heart.” Formed in 1946, the Blue Angels are the second-oldest aerobatic flying team in the world after the French Air Force Patrouille de France, created in 1931. The U.S. team consists of aviators from the Navy and Marine Corps, and flies distinctive blue and gold Boeing F/A-18 Hornets and the C-130, nicknamed “Fat Albert.” Also appearing in the 2017 show will be the Snowbirds, with nine CT-114 Tutors. The team has been flying since 1971. General admission to the Huntington Beach Airshow is free. Premium hospitality options are also available. A portion of the proceeds from the air show support the Aerospace Education Foundation of Huntington Beach, a nonprofit that encourages education and careers in the aerospace and aviation fields.

Transducers), By End-Use And Segment Forecast, 2014 - 2025 News provided by Reportlinker Jan 04, 2017, 14:36 ET Share this article NEW YORK, Jan. 4, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- The global piezoelectric materials market is expected to reach USD 1.68 billion by 2025, according to a new report by Grand View Research, Inc. Rising sales of consumer electronics including LED televisions in developing countries including China, Thailand, and India as a result of product innovation is expected to play a significant role in increasing the requirement of sensors, which in turn will augment industry growth. Piezopolymers are projected to witness growth at a CAGR of 4% from 2016 to 2025. Rising importance of polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) as an electroactive polymer material with low piezoelectric coefficient as compared to ceramic counterparts is expected to increase its demand in hydrophones, clamp-on transducers and pressure-based sensors for diesel injection lines. Further key findings from the report suggest: The market for acoustic devices was valued at USD 83.4 million in 2015 and is expected to foresee significant gains on account of technological advancement regarding smart electric guitars in developed countries including Germany and UK Aerospace & defense sector is projected to grow at a CAGR of 5.3% from 2016 to 2025. Over the past few years, aerospace OEMs including Boeing, GE Aerospace, and Lockheed Martin have launched new aircraft as a result of increasing commercial fleets on a global level, which is expected to promote the usage of piezoelectric materials over the next nine years. Asia Pacific is projected to witness growth at a CAGR of 4.5% from 2016 to 2025. Supporting government policies in China and India to promote investments within the domestic healthcare sector is expected to improve the production of pharmaceutical drugs and devices and thus likely to fuel demand over the forecast period. Major manufacturers include PI Ceramic, Harris Corporation, and APC International, which are concentrating on product innovation where research institutes are developing products that can be commercially utilized. For instance, in July 2014, the researchers of Delft University, Netherlands, announced the development of PZT Composite Touch Sensors for integration with Flexible OLED Technology.

After Falcon 9 Explosion Report, Musk's Company To Carry Iridium Satellite Sunday By Clark Mindock @clarkmindock On 01/04/17 AT 11:46 AM Close Just over four months ago, SpaceX encountered one if its biggest setbacks in the company’s nearly 15 years of existence. A rocket set to carry a satellite into space exploded on a Florida launch pad then, grounding the company for the rest of the year. But, after announcing they had identified the problem this week, the aerospace manufacturer is set to achieve liftoff once again Sunday. The explosion came down to a split second of disaster, SpaceX announced Monday in an anomaly update. After investigators reviewed 3,000 channels of video and data there were just 93 milliseconds between the first sign of a problem and the explosion. After a full review of available information, SpaceX said that the explosion was caused by one of three vessels storing cold helium that are used to maintain tank pressure in a liquid oxygen tank in the Falcon 9 rocket.
