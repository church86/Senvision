More Comments LinkedIn Tumblr Pinterest Digg FarkIt StumbleUpon Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan suggested Wednesday that Boeing, the U.S. aerospace firm from whom the government is considering purchasing billions of dollars worth of fighter jets, can no longer be considered a trusted partner. And though he stopped short of cancelling the Liberal government’s plan to purchase 18 Super Hornet fighters from Boeing, Sajjan said company has damaged its relationship with Canada. Boeing has complained to the U.S. government that Canadian aerospace firm Bombardier is receiving subsidies, allowing it to sell its C-Series aircraft at below-market prices. Boeing convinced the U.S. Commerce Department and International Trade Commission to launch an investigation into Bombardier. “It is not the behaviour of a trusted partner,” Sajjan told industry representatives Wednesday at the CANSEC defence trade show in Ottawa. He called on Boeing to withdraw its complaint, saying Canada requires “trusted industry partners.” Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland also recently chastened Boeing for its actions. But industry representatives consider Sajjan’s dressing down of the company in such a high-profile forum unprecedented. The Liberals are now reviewing the Super Hornet jet proposal and whether they should continue with it. “We are continuing our discussions with the U.S. government and we continue to do that,” Sajjan said. Canada, however, is no longer talking to Boeing officials. Canada has not yet signed the deal to acquire the Super Hornets. It was expected to do so by the end of this year or early next. If it proceeds, the Super Hornet purchase is expected to cost between $5 billion and $7 billion.  It is now unclear when the deal might proceed, or if it will be scuttled if Boeing does not withdraw its complaint against Bombardier. Other aerospace firms are in the wings ready to offer Canada new aircraft, including Lockheed Martin with its F-35 fighter jet. Sajjan said Canada has had a good relationship with Boeing over the decades but is now reviewing all procurement with that company. The defence minister’s dig at Boeing comes as the U.S. firm prepares to announce its industry team members for the Super Hornet interim fighter jet project. That announcement is expected to come at CANSEC on Thursday.

The U.S. investigation into Bombardier will examine the dumping of commercial aircraft into the U.S. market. “The U.S. market is the most open in the world, but we must take action if our rules are being broken,” U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said in a statement after the hearing into Boeing’s claim. • Email: dpugliese@postmedia.com | Twitter: davidpugliese Find National Post on Facebook Twitter Google+ Reddit Email Typo?

Dave Majumdar May 31, 2017 TweetShareShare The Pentagon’s Missile Defense Agency (MDA) demonstrated the ability to intercept an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) using Ground-based Midcourse Defense (GMD) interceptors for the first time during a live test on May 30. According to the MDA, the test looks likely to have been a success—though the agency will have to analyze the data to be sure. During the test, a roughly five-foot long Raytheon-built exo-atmospheric kill vehicle slammed head-on directly into an ICBM-class test target that was launched from the Reagan Test Site on Kwajalein Atoll in the Republic of the Marshall Islands (in the Pacific). The U.S. Air Force’s 30th Space launched the interceptor missile Wing from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. "The intercept of a complex, threat-representative ICBM target is an incredible accomplishment for the GMD system and a critical milestone for this program," MDA Director Vice Adm. Jim Syring said in a statement. "This system is vitally important to the defense of our homeland, and this test demonstrates that we have a capable, credible deterrent against a very real threat. I am incredibly proud of the warfighters who executed this test and who operate this system every day." The MDA notes that intercepting the Orbital-built ICBM target required precise coordination from multiple sensors across the globe.  Northrop Grumman’s sophisticated Command, Control, Battle Management and Communication (C2BMC) system integrated data from Raytheon’s forward deployed AN/TPY-2 and the Sea-Based X-band radar—positioned in the Pacific Ocean— to develop target tracking data and a fire control solution to intercept the target. Boeing, which is the prime contractor for the overall GMD system, was thrilled with the results of the test—which pave the way for expanding the expansion of the entire construct. “This successful test keeps the United States on track for a significant increase in interceptor inventory of 44 in 2017,” Norm Tew, Boeing’s vice president and GMD program director said. “In addition, the GMD program remains on track to evolve and modernize this crucial national defense asset in the face of an evolving threat environment, with system upgrades and future technology including the Boeing-led Redesigned Kill Vehicle (RKV).” The MDA cautions that data from the test still has to be analyzed to be sure that the intercept worked properly. “Initial indications are that the test met its primary objective, but program officials will continue to evaluate system performance based upon telemetry and other data obtained during the test,” the MDA states. Altogether, the test cost roughly $244 million. Though the test has been portrayed as a signal to North Korea, in reality it was a happy coincidence—the intercept test has long been in the works. The MDA argues that the GMD was tested in an operationally setting against a target—complete with decoys—representative of a threat well into the 2020s. “This did represent a very real operational scenario in the Pacific,” Syring told reporters at the Pentagon on May 31. However, critics contend that the GMD system—as it currently stands—has not demonstrated the ability to intercept a real ICBM under wartime conditions. In fact, such a capability is a long way off. Indeed, according to the GAO, the MDA won’t even test the system in the rain. “Not even close,” Jeffrey Lewis, Director of the East Asia Nonproliferation Program at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey told The National Interest. “It's a nice baby step.” Even if the MDA conducted tests under realistic conditions, the program is still essentially a research and development program in many ways. The agency—which is not part of any military service—does not have a strategy or doctrine on how to use the system operationally. “The MDA is still running a technology development program and hasn't really thought about transitioning it to an credible operational capability, despite their silly pronouncements to the contrary,” Lewis said. Moreover, in Lewis’ view, nor does the MDA have the capacity to transition the GMD into a genuine operational capability to defend the United States. “I don't think MDA has the capacity, no. I would return the mission to the services,” Lewis said. “Basically, we should treat missile defense like any other defense program. If it provides a cost-effective military benefit, great.  If not, spend the money on something that does.” Pages 1 2 next › last » TweetShareShare Show full page View the discussion thread.

Harjit Sajjan said Boeing’s action against Bombardier is “unfounded” and not the behavior of a “trusted partner.” He said buying the Super Hornet fighter jets “requires a trusted industry partner.” Sajjan urged Boeing to withdraw the complaint in a speech. Canada’s foreign minister has also threatened to block the order. “Our government – and I stress this – our government is disappointed in the action of one of our leading industry partners,” he said. Register now to learn how DHS and Commerce are implementing CDM strategies. Advertisement Chicago-based Boeing’s trade complaint prompted a U.S. Commerce Department anti-dumping investigation that could result in duties being imposed on Bombardier’s new larger CSeries passenger aircraft. Boeing insists the plane receives Canadian government subsidies that give it an advantage internationally. Canada’s threat is coming amid increasing trade disputes with the U.S. Scott Day, a spokesman for Boeing, noted that Sajjan also recognized Boeing as a strong partner in the past and for the future. Day defended the company’s trade action. “This is a commercial matter that Boeing is seeking to address through the normal course for resolving such issues,” Day said in an email. Boeing petitioned the U.S. Commerce Department and the U.S. International Trade Commission to investigate subsidies of Montreal-based Bombardier’s CSeries aircraft. Boeing says Bombardier has received more than US$3 billion in government subsidies that let it engage in “predatory pricing.” Brazil has also launched a formal complaint to the World Trade Organization over Canadian subsidies to Bombardier. Sao Paolo-based Embraer is a fierce rival of Bombardier’s. The true impact of cutting EPA's budget. The Quebec government invested US$1 billion in exchange for a 49.5 percent stake in the CSeries last year. Canada’s federal government also recently provided a US$275 million loan to Bombardier, which struggled to win orders for its new medium-size plane. But Bombardier won a 75-plane order for the CSeries from U.S.-based Delta Air Lines in 2016. Bombardier said its planes never competed with Boeing in the sale to Delta. The Canadian government said late last year it would enter into discussions on buying 18 Super Hornet jet fighters from Boeing on an interim basis and hold an open competition to buy more planes over the next five years. Canada remains part of Lockheed Martin’s F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program. Sajjan said he would have more to say about the issue next week.

The Pentagon wants to get a head start on the jet that will eventually replace the US Air Force C-32A, the Boeing 757 jets calibrated for flying the vice president and other senior level government officials, Defense One reported. © AP Photo/ Andrew Harnik Problems With Air Force One Mark 'Very Serious Blow to Boeing's Reputation' Longer flying range, more seats, a new private office and “enhanced senior leader communications” are a few of the items on the wish list for the next Air Force Two, which a new $6 million program office will seek to deliver, the budget request states. The “doomsday” fleet of four Pentagon-altered 747s strengthen communications abilities in times of nuclear war and function as a flying executive command and control room. The new budget integrates two worst-case scenario jet programs, the doomsday plane and the Navy’s E-6 Mercury, into one program dubbed the Survivable Airborne Operations Center (SOAC).  SOAC hopes to score $7.8 million to explore new aircraft to replace aging doomsday aircraft.   Air Force Two and Air Force One are supposed to serve the presidents at any time needed, especially in the event of nuclear war. Preparing the planes for atomically induced chaos is why some aerospace analysts argue Boeing’s $3.2-$4 billion new Air Force One is magnitudes costlier than the 747’s commercial price of $378.5 million.  © AP Photo/ Cliff Owen Boeing Pays Tab on $4M Damage to POTUS’ Air Force One After Dangerous Mistake The hope is to “better align” the next generations of Air Force One and Air Force Two, according to the Pentagon. By making a more “robust” Air Force Two, the government says it could “mitigate many capability gaps that exist when the current C-32A aircraft serve as a backup to VC-25A [the current 747 available for the president]” and the new Air Force One.  Boeing swallowed a $4 million expense for mechanical mishaps rendering the POTUS’ personal jet susceptible to fire.  ...

Although he stopped short of cancelling the Liberal government’s plan to purchase 18 Super Hornet fighters from Boeing, Sajjan said the U.S. firm has damaged its relationship with Canada. Boeing has complained to the U.S. government that Canadian aerospace firm Bombardier is receiving subsidies, which in turn, allowed it to sell its C-Series aircraft at below-market prices. Boeing convinced the U.S. Commerce Department and International Trade Commission to launch an investigation into Bombardier. “It is not the behaviour of a trusted partner,” Sajjan told industry representatives Wednesday at the CANSEC defence trade show in Ottawa. He called on Boeing to withdraw its complaint. Sajjan said Canada requires “trusted industry partners.” Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland also recently chastened Boeing for its actions. But Sajjan’s dressing down of the company in such a high profile forum is considered by industry representatives as unprecedented. The Liberals are now reviewing the Super Hornet jet proposal and whether it should continue. “We are continuing our discussions with the U.S. government and we continue to do that,” Sajjan said of talks over the acquisition of the fighter jets. Canada, however, is no longer talking to Boeing officials. The Super Hornet purchase, if it proceeds, is expected to cost $5 billion to $7 billion. Canada has not yet signed the deal to acquire the Super Hornets. That was expected to be in place by the end of the year or early next year. It is unclear now on when that deal might proceed or whether it will be scuttled if Boeing does not withdraw its complaint against Bombardier. Other aerospace firms are in the wings ready to offer Canada new aircraft. Those companies include Lockheed Martin with its F-35 fighter jet. Sajjan said Canada has had a good relationship with Boeing over the decades but it is now reviewing all procurements with that company. Sajjan’s dig at Boeing comes as the U.S. firm prepares to announce its industry team members for the Super Hornet interim fighter jet project. That will happen at CANSEC on Thursday. On the Wednesday at CANSEC the Boeing team was highlighting the company’s long-term commitment to Canada. The U.S. investigation into Bombardier will examine the dumping of commercial aircraft into the U.S. market. “The U.S. market is the most open in the world, but we must take action if our rules are being broken,” U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said in a statement after the hearing into Boeing’s claim.   Boeing Company Harjit Sajjan sponsored Mark Norman’s replacement makes his public debut  Protesters jam up CANSEC traffic Video Connect With Us Email Alerts Get the latest news in your mailbox as it happens Weather Weather Currently Feels Like We want you to have the most accurate weather report you can.

Sajjan said Canada is disappointed by the “unfounded” action by one of its major partners in the defence industry and he delivered that message to hundreds at a breakfast speech at a major trade show for military contractors. Boeing has petitioned the U.S. Commerce Department and the U.S. International Trade Commission to investigate subsidies for Bombardier’s CSeries aircraft that it says have allowed the Canadian company to export planes at well below cost. Sajjan said Boeing is not behaving like a “trusted partner” and the government wants the company to withdraw the complaint. He repeated the Canadian government’s thinly veiled retaliation threat to scrap the planned purchase of 18 Super Hornet fighter jets from the Boeing. “A productive relationship between industry and government is crucial,” the minister said. “That is why our government _ and I stress this _ our government is disappointed in the action of one of our leading industry partners. “We strongly disagree with the decision of the United States Commerce Department to initiate a trade remedy case in response to Boeing’s petition against Bombardier.” Scott Day, a spokesman for Boeing, defended the company’s trade action, suggesting it should not be linked to its military relationship with Canada. “It’s more of a commercial issue with regard to the Bombardier case,” he said. “We’re going to continue working with the U.S. navy, providing information on the Super Hornet that will be provided to the government of Canada.” Day said Boeing operations in Canada account for 14 per cent of the country’s aerospace industry. That includes 560 companies that provide parts to Boeing commercial airplanes and 2,000 company workers in the country. “We value Canada as a supplier-partner.” Sajjan also said the defence policy review that he will unveil next week will be linked to the government’s broader innovation agenda. He said the military wants to help foster a partnership with the defence industry that allows for the development of cutting-edge equipment for Canadian soldiers. Sajjan also made a pitch for the defence industry to help Canada with its broader agenda with the U.S. _ keeping borders open to trade in the face of possible protectionist action by the Donald Trump administration. “We call on all of our industry partners to speak with one voice about the interconnectedness of the defence industry supply chain between Canada and the United States,” Sajjan said. “We need your help in making the clear case of ensuring goods continue to flow freely across our two countries. We need your voices to articulate the consequences should our borders be closed. The government will continue to deliver this same message.” Follow us on Facebook Follow us on Twitter Get our daily briefing on innovation, leadership, technology & the economy. Weekdays at 6 AM ET.

In the prepared text of a speech, Sajjan called on Boeing to abandon an anti-dumping challenge it has launched against Canadian plane maker Bombardier Inc, saying Ottawa was disappointed by the U.S. firm's behavior. Earlier this month, in response to the trade challenge, Canada said it was reviewing the planned purchase of 18 Boeing Super Hornet jets. Boeing accuses Bombardier of selling airliners on the U.S. market at artificially low prices.

Sajjan called on Boeing to abandon the anti-dumping challenge it has launched against Canadian plane maker Bombardier, saying Ottawa was disappointed by the U.S. company's behavior. Canada has threatened to scrap plans to buy Boeing fighter jets over the dispute. "We have a longstanding relationship with Boeing, and as I stated, we're hoping that this can be resolved in a ... manner that respects everyone," Sajjan told reporters on the sidelines of a defence industry event in Ottawa. Boeing accuses Bombardier of selling airliners in the U.S. market at artificially low prices. In response to Sajjan's request to withdraw the petition, Boeing spokesman Dan Curran said by email that "this is a commercial matter that Boeing is seeking to address through the normal course for resolving such issues." Earlier this month, in response to Boeing's challenge at the U.S. International Trade Commission, Canada said it was reviewing the planned purchase of 18 Boeing Super Hornet jets. . When asked whether Ottawa would scrap the order if Boeing failed to drop its complaint, Sajjan said "we need to let the process take its course." The Super Hornets are needed as an interim measure until Ottawa can run a competition to replace its aging fleet of CF-18 fighters. "The interim fleet procurement requires a trusted industry partner. For decades, Boeing has been an outstanding partner with the Canadian Armed Forces ... I expect that to be the case in the decades to come," he said during a speech. "However, our government is of the view that their action against Bombardier is unfounded. It is not the behavior we expect of a trusted partner, and we call on Boeing to withdraw it."

Skip to navigation Skip to content Skip to sidebar News National More Defence minister says Boeing’s complaint about Bombardier means it’s no longer a ‘trusted partner’ David Pugliese, Ottawa Citizen  05.31.2017 The Liberal government announced earlier this year a plan to purchase "interim" Super Hornets form Boeing. Minister of National Defence Harjit Sajjan rises during Question Period in the House of Commons on Parliament Hill, Friday, April 7, 2017 in Ottawa. The Boeing F-18 Super Hornet performs during its demonstration flight, on the first day of the 47th Paris Air Show in Le Bourget, north of Paris on June 18, 2007. ShareAdjustCommentPrint Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan suggested Wednesday that Boeing, the U.S. aerospace firm from whom the government is considering purchasing billions of dollars worth of fighter jets, can no longer be considered a trusted partner. And though he stopped short of cancelling the Liberal government’s plan to purchase 18 Super Hornet fighters from Boeing, Sajjan said company has damaged its relationship with Canada. Boeing has complained to the U.S. government that Canadian aerospace firm Bombardier is receiving subsidies, allowing it to sell its C-Series aircraft at below-market prices. Boeing convinced the U.S. Commerce Department and International Trade Commission to launch an investigation into Bombardier. “It is not the behaviour of a trusted partner,” Sajjan told industry representatives Wednesday at the CANSEC defence trade show in Ottawa. He called on Boeing to withdraw its complaint, saying Canada requires “trusted industry partners.” Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland also recently chastened Boeing for its actions. But industry representatives consider Sajjan’s dressing down of the company in such a high-profile forum unprecedented. The Liberals are now reviewing the Super Hornet jet proposal and whether they should continue with it. “We are continuing our discussions with the U.S. government and we continue to do that,” Sajjan said. Canada, however, is no longer talking to Boeing officials. Canada has not yet signed the deal to acquire the Super Hornets. It was expected to do so by the end of this year or early next. If it proceeds, the Super Hornet purchase is expected to cost between $5 billion and $7 billion.  It is now unclear when the deal might proceed, or if it will be scuttled if Boeing does not withdraw its complaint against Bombardier. Other aerospace firms are in the wings ready to offer Canada new aircraft, including Lockheed Martin with its F-35 fighter jet. Sajjan said Canada has had a good relationship with Boeing over the decades but is now reviewing all procurement with that company. The defence minister’s dig at Boeing comes as the U.S. firm prepares to announce its industry team members for the Super Hornet interim fighter jet project. That announcement is expected to come at CANSEC on Thursday. On Wednesday the Boeing team used the defence industry trade show to highlight the company’s long-term commitment to Canada. The U.S. investigation into Bombardier will examine the dumping of commercial aircraft into the U.S. market. “The U.S. market is the most open in the world, but we must take action if our rules are being broken,” U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said in a statement after the hearing into Boeing’s claim. • Email: dpugliese@postmedia.com | Twitter: davidpugliese Comments We encourage all readers to share their views on our articles and blog posts.

In the prepared text of a speech, Mr Sajjan called on Boeing to abandon an anti-dumping challenge it has launched against Canadian plane maker Bombardier, saying Ottawa was disappointed by the US firm’s behaviour. Earlier this month, in response to the trade challenge, Canada said it was reviewing the planned purchase of 18 Boeing Super Hornet jets. Boeing accuses Bombardier of selling airliners on the US market at artificially low prices. Mr Sajjan said the Super Hornets were needed as an interim measure until Ottawa can run a competition to replace its ageing fleet of CF-18 fighters. "The interim fleet procurement requires a trusted industry partner. For decades, Boeing has been an outstanding partner with the Canadian Armed Forces … I expect that to be the case in the decades to come," he said. "However, our government is of the view that their action against Bombardier is unfounded. It is not the behavior we expect of a trusted partner, and we call on Boeing to withdraw it," he continued. * Reuters business@thenational.ae Follow The National’s Business section on Twitter Pages: Add your comment View all comments More Aviation Boeing still Canada’s friend despite Bombardier spat Norwegian airline to offer ultra-cheap US to Rome flights Take our quick 20-question quiz on May’s business news British Airways pays the price for endlessly cutting costs MOST VIEWED Business | All Adnoc weighs new US$20bn offshore gas project to meet UAE’s growing demand DXB Entertainments appoints Mohamed Almulla as chief executive Opening hours at Abu Dhabi shopping malls during Ramadan Most popular smartphone brands, Q1 2017 – in pictures Dubai’s strategy centre for Islamic finance close to goals UAE climbs competitiveness index on economy ranking ADGM to launch wealth-management foundations Abu Dhabi’s Nimr takes vehicle muscle to Europe DXB Entertainments chief to lead new Meraas-Dubai Holding project group Dubai property marketing permit procedures must be followed More Most Viewed FNC approves bill that limits domestic staff’s work hours Distracted driver crashes into police patrol car in Al Wathba Underperforming private schools in Abu Dhabi - graphic Abu Dhabi taxi fare increase comes into effect UAE Netflix users disappointed as licensing deal leads to House of Cards streaming delay Qatar Emir in Kuwait for talks on resolving GCC row Young, male Emiratis more likely to be involved in car accidents, study shows Adec announces weak private schools banned from registering new pupils Antoine Griezmann keen on Man United but Atletico will demand record fee: Primera Liga in focus Phone addiction ‘leading to less empathy’, Ramadan majlis hears More Most Viewed Back to the top EDITOR'S PICKS The Debt Panel: Philip King on avoiding the debt trap – video The Debt Panel: Gaurav Bhalla on helping people manage their debt – video Where Abu Dhabi rents have risen and fallen, Q1 2017 – in pictures Where Dubai rents have risen and fallen, Q1 2017 – in pictures FOLLOW US Tweets by @TheNationalUAE SPOTLIGHT At least 90 killed and hundreds wounded in car bomb attack in Kabul diplomatic quarter Most popular smartphone brands, Q1 2017 – in pictures Switch to Mobile Site About us Contact us Work with us Privacy policy Terms and conditions Advertise with us Subscribe Sitemap super.ae alittihad.ae thenational.ae anazahra.com ngalarabiya.com adtv.ae adradio.ae admedia.ae

Hainan Airlines unveils third Kung Fu Panda-themed plane as part of collaboration with DreamWorks Animation Hainan Airlines unveils third Kung Fu Panda-themed plane as part of collaboration with DreamWorks Animation TRASPORTI E LOGISTICA Tweet Condividi su WhatsApp Pubblicato il: 31/05/2017 12:47 The plane featuring a design by young American designer Hannah Foss takes its inaugural flight, in celebration of the Chinese airline's 24 th anniversary BEIJING, May 31, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- A Hainan Airlines' Dreamliner, adorned with Po, the main character in the Kung Fu Panda film, and the famous panda's friends, took off on the inaugural flight for its new service HU7181, from Haikou to Beijing, on the morning of May 29, 2017. As the Chinese airline's third Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner in the fleet to receive the "King Fu Panda" makeover, the eye-catching yellow-colored airplane started its maiden flight to the cheers of the crowd. The flight carried a special passenger, Hannah Foss, a young designer from the state of Alaska. When Hannah Foss submitted her "Kung Fu Panda"-themed Dreamliner design last September, she was one of nearly 3,000 online entries that all shared the same dream: To have their design painted on a real-life, Hainan Airlines Boeing 787 Dreamliner. That dream started several months ago when Hainan, Boeing and DreamWorks announced a partnership that would include the introduction of six specially-painted Dreamliners over the next two years, featuring characters and scenes from the popular animated franchise. "I have loved painting and designing since I was a child. I have designed a dinosaur exhibition for a museum and depicted the Northern lights around the Arctic Circle in my artwork. But I never thought that my design would be painted on a plane someday. It feels amazing! This is the first time that I have come to China, taken a Boeing Dreamliner and witnessed the process of the painting of a plane. I really appreciate these "firsts" that Hainan Airlines has offered to me," Ms. Foss said as part of a speech she gave over the plane's announcement system during which she shared her thrilling story with the over 200 passengers on the flight. "This is an exceptional journey for me, giving many Americans like myself the opportunity to learn about Hainan Airlines and better understand the distinguished Chinese company's idea of cherishing every person's dream in addition to its ongoing commitment to fulfilling dreams." Hannah grew up in Adelaide, South Australia and moved to Alaska in 2008.    Some of her adventures include spending several years as a paleontological artist, CGI-animating a couple of museum films, constructing a 16-ft long dinosaur puppet called Snaps, eating tasty muktuk, snow-machining on the Chukchi Sea and meeting a polar bear. In addition to having her design painted on a Dreamlinerand to be part of this amazing journey, Hannah won two round-trip, business class tickets to China, as well as a weeks' accommodations at a luxury hotel. The "Kung Fu Panda" story is deeply rooted in traditional Chinese culture and history. Hannah's design wove together popular characters like Po and Tigress, with traditional Chinese "chops" and a painted sunrise. The design was awarded the top prize based on its originality, creativity, humor, its reflection of Chinese culture, and its wow factor. When Hannah's design is painted onto the new Dreamliner, the airplane will fly several of Hainan's more than 40 nonstop routes between China and North America. It will join two other specially painted airplanes, the first of which touched down at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport last year. That airplane carried over 100 students and teachers from Lincoln High School in Tacoma, WA, who were returning from a life-changing, 11-day trip to China. Hainan Airlines is proud to partner with DreamWorks and Boeing to bring the "Kung Fu Panda" franchise to Hainan's elite service and premier experience. Look forward for more partnerships like this in the future, and be sure to keep an eye out for #TheFlyingPanda throughout our North American network! Hainan Airlines has continued with its strategy of working hand-in-hand with the Chinese government's One Belt, One Road initiative as part of its overall plan to aggressively expand its presence in international markets. Nevertheless, despite the complexities of operating in the highly competitive international markets, the airline has never wavered from its original set of goals of consistently combining the brand's unique Oriental hospitality with modern service standards, a concept which is embodied in the Kung Fu Panda planes. The airline has promoted its image in the global aviation market through the cooperation with DreamWorks, demonstrating the newfound stature of Chinese companies on the world stage while allowing travelers everywhere to gain a better understanding of Chinese culture and its richness.     Photo - https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/517732/3rd_Kung_Fu_Panda_themed_plane.jpgPhoto - https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/517733/Hannah_Foss.jpgPhoto - https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/517731/Hannah_Foss_with_crew.jpg   Tweet Condividi su WhatsApp TAG: Immediapress, comunicati, aziende informano, press release Commenti Per scrivere un commento è necessario registrarsi ed accedere: ACCEDI oppure REGISTRATI "Mia figlia, vittima della Blue whale" Cerca Notizie Più Cliccate 1.

Deal Tweet TEHRAN (FNA)- Head of the Public Relations at Iran's Civil Aviation Organization Reza Jafarzadeh warned Washington that any restriction on Tehran's purchase of passenger planes would violate the 2015 nuclear deal. "Any restriction on the sales of airplanes to Iran violates the nuclear deal by the US," Jafarzadeh said on Wednesday. Stressing that the European governments do not agree with imposition of restrictions on the sales of passenger planes to Iran, he said that they will not allow the US to do so because the interests of their companies will be at risk. On Tuesday, the Iranian government warned the foreign states and companies which have signed contracts to sell passenger planes to Tehran of the country's reciprocal moves if the other parties defy their undertakings. "If any measure is taken in violation of the contract to purchase planes, we will reciprocate," Government Spokesman Mohammad Baqer Nobakht told reporters in his weekly press conference in Tehran. His remarks came after US Secretary of Treasury Steven Mnuchin announced last week that the department is reviewing licenses for Boeing and Airbus to sell aircraft to Iran, telling lawmakers he would increase sanctions pressure on Iran. Mnuchin did not elaborate on the review of the licenses, which were issued under a 2015 agreement between Tehran and world powers to lift sanctions in return for curbs on Iran’s nuclear activities. The review suggests that Trump’s support for Boeing’s defense and jetliner businesses could have political limits. Iran has said that halting the airplane deals would breach the 2015 nuclear agreement. For Boeing, losing the Iran Air deal could affect 777 production, since 15 of the wide-body jetliners are included in the first approved batch of Boeing aircraft due for delivery to Iran Air by 2020. Deliveries start in May next year. Boeing said in December it would cut 777 output by 40% this year under plans that include Iran Air’s still-tentative order. Iran's National Flag Carrier, Iran Air, has agreed to buy 200 US and European passenger aircraft worth up to $37 billion at list prices, though such deals typically include big discounts. They include 80 jets from Boeing, 100 from Airbus and 20 turboprops from Franco-Italian ATR. All the aircraft need US licenses because of their reliance on US parts. Meantime, Managing Director of Iran Air Farhad Parvaresh announced late in March that the giant aviation company Airbus has delivered the third passenger plane to the country. "The third Airbus, an A330, landed at Tehran's Mehrabad airport," Parvaresh said at the time. He noted that the A330 plane which has 32 business class and 206 economy class seats is suitable for long-distance flights.         Related News Iran Issues Stern Warning over Passenger Planes Contracts  LATEST STORIES (10) Saudi Onslaught against Shiites Continues in Awamiyah Adding to Chaos: US Sending More Arms to Imperial Foot Soldiers in Syria Syrian Pro-Government Forces Advance in Strategic Area of Helba Southeast of Palmyra Syria: Drone Footage Shows Russian Navy's Missile Strikes on ISIL Positions Hashid Al-Shaabi on Border with Syria to Begin Operation against ISIL Philippines' Troops Push against ISIL in Marawi City Syria: Army in Heavy Clashes with Militants in Eastern Ghouta More Than 60 Killed by Massive Car Bomb in Kabul's Diplomatic Quarter Iraqis' Lives inside Hassansham U2 Camp during Ramadan Massive Explosion in Kabul's Diplomatic Quarter Leaves at Least 64 Dead, 300 Injured Official: Any Restriction on Sales of Passenger Planes to Iran Violates N.

If you'd like to learn more... - A A + Listen OTTAWA – Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan used a major speech Wednesday to the defence industry to blast American firm Boeing for picking a trade spat with Bombardier. Sajjan said Canada is disappointed by the “unfounded” action by one of its major partners in the defence industry and he delivered that message to hundreds at a breakfast speech at a major trade show for military contractors.

Sajjan said Canada is disappointed by the "unfounded" action by one of its major partners in the defence industry and he delivered that message to hundreds at a breakfast speech at a major trade show for military contractors. Boeing has petitioned the U.S. Commerce Department and the U.S. International Trade Commission to investigate subsidies for Bombardier's CSeries aircraft that it says have allowed the Canadian company to export planes at well below cost. Sajjan said Boeing is not behaving like a "trusted partner" and the government wants the company to withdraw the complaint.

"A productive relationship between industry and government is crucial," the minister said. "That is why our government — and I stress this — our government is disappointed in the action of one of our leading industry partners.

"We're going to continue working with the U.S. navy, providing information on the Super Hornet that will be provided to the government of Canada." "Our government — and I stress this — our government is disappointed in the action of one of our leading industry partners." Day said Boeing operations in Canada account for 14 per cent of the country's aerospace industry. That includes 560 companies that provide parts to Boeing commercial airplanes and 2,000 company workers in the country. "We value Canada as a supplier-partner." Sajjan also said the defence policy review that he will unveil next week will be linked to the government's broader innovation agenda. He said the military wants to help foster a partnership with the defence industry that allows for the development of cutting-edge equipment for Canadian soldiers.

Sajjan used a major speech Wednesday to the defence industry to blast American firm Boeing for picking a trade spat with Bombardier. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Adrian Wyld next play/pause pre OTTAWA — As he highlighted the defence industry as a driver of economic growth, Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan also used a major speech Wednesday to blast American firm Boeing for picking a trade spat with Bombardier. Sajjan said Canada is disappointed by the "unfounded" action by one of its major partners in the defence industry and he delivered that message to hundreds at a breakfast speech at a major trade show for military contractors in Ottawa. Boeing has petitioned the U.S. Commerce Department and the U.S. International Trade Commission to investigate subsidies for Bombardier's CSeries aircraft that it says have allowed the Canadian company to export planes at well below cost. Sajjan said Boeing is not behaving like a "trusted partner" and the government wants the company to withdraw the complaint. The minister stressed the military's links with industry in a speech that also gave new details about the defence policy review that he will unveil next week — it will be linked to the government's broader innovation agenda. He said the military wants to help foster a partnership with the defence industry that allows for the development of cutting-edge equipment for Canadian soldiers. He identified four areas of focus: alternative fuels, surveillance tools, remotely piloted systems and systems to counter IEDs. "We will establish world-class research clusters, comprised of academics, industry leaders, government scientists," Sajjan said, adding that cutting edge research and development "will determine the outcome of tomorrow's conflicts." The Canadian Forces will help companies field test new products to ensure they meet military needs. "It means we give business the experience and exposures they can use to pursue opportunities in global markets." The military's newly installed second-in-command, Lt.-Gen. Alain Parent, said the Canadian Forces will make innovation a priority because it is a "strategic imperative" in the world's complex security environment. "To prevail in that environment, we need to exploit every decisive advantage over potential adversaries," Parent told the same large CANSEC military trade show. Innovation Minister Navdeep Bains, in a separate CANSEC speech, underlined the contribution of the defence industry to the Canadian economy — $9 billion a year of economic activity and 63,000 skilled jobs in small and large firms. "To remain competitive, Canada must be committed to innovation," Bains said. "I appreciate this industry's long history of finding new and better ways to accomplish the mission." Boeing, however, was singled out for pointed criticism. Sajjan repeated the Canadian government's thinly veiled retaliation threat to scrap the planned purchase of 18 Super Hornet fighter jets from the Boeing. "A productive relationship between industry and government is crucial," Sajjan said. "That is why our government — and I stress this — our government is disappointed in the action of one of our leading industry partners. "We strongly disagree with the decision of the United States Commerce Department to initiate a trade remedy case in response to Boeing's petition against Bombardier." Scott Day, a spokesman for Boeing, defended the company's trade action, suggesting it should not be linked to its military relationship with Canada. "It's more of a commercial issue with regard to the Bombardier case," he said. "We're going to continue working with the U.S. navy, providing information on the Super Hornet that will be provided to the government of Canada." Day said Boeing operations in Canada account for 14 per cent of the country's aerospace industry. That includes 560 companies that provide parts to Boeing commercial airplanes and 2,000 company workers in the country. "We value Canada as a supplier-partner." Sajjan also made a pitch for the defence industry to help Canada with its broader agenda with the U.S. — keeping borders open to trade in the face of possible protectionist action by the Donald Trump administration. "We call on all of our industry partners to speak with one voice about the interconnectedness of the defence industry supply chain between Canada and the United States," Sajjan said. "We need your help in making the clear case of ensuring goods continue to flow freely across our two countries. We need your voices to articulate the consequences should our borders be closed. The government will continue to deliver this same message."

Yes No View Results  Loading ... Follow @LethHerald on twitter By Mike Blanchfield, The Canadian Press on May 31, 2017. Minister of National Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan speaks at the Canadian Association of Defence and Security conference in Ottawa, Wednesday May 31, 2017. Sajjan used a major speech Wednesday to the defence industry to blast American firm Boeing for picking a trade spat with Bombardier. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Adrian Wyld OTTAWA – Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan used a major speech Wednesday to the defence industry to blast American firm Boeing for picking a trade spat with Bombardier. Sajjan said Canada is disappointed by the “unfounded” action by one of its major partners in the defence industry and he delivered that message to hundreds at a breakfast speech at a major trade show for military contractors. Boeing has petitioned the U.S. Commerce Department and the U.S. International Trade Commission to investigate subsidies for Bombardier’s CSeries aircraft that it says have allowed the Canadian company to export planes at well below cost. Sajjan said Boeing is not behaving like a “trusted partner” and the government wants the company to withdraw the complaint. He repeated the Canadian government’s thinly veiled retaliation threat to scrap the planned purchase of 18 Super Hornet fighter jets from the Boeing. “A productive relationship between industry and government is crucial,” the minister said. “That is why our government – and I stress this – our government is disappointed in the action of one of our leading industry partners. “We strongly disagree with the decision of the United States Commerce Department to initiate a trade remedy case in response to Boeing’s petition against Bombardier.” Sajjan also said the defence policy review that he will unveil next week will be linked to the government’s broader innovation agenda. He said the military wants to help foster a partnership with the defence industry that allows for the development of cutting-edge equipment for Canadian soldiers. Sajjan also made a pitch for the defence industry to help Canada with its broader agenda with the U.S. – keeping borders open to trade in the face of possible protectionist action by the Donald Trump administration. “We call on all of our industry partners to speak with one voice about the interconnectedness of the defence industry supply chain between Canada and the United States,” Sajjan said. “We need your help in making the clear case of ensuring goods continue to flow freely across our two countries.

Accordingly, we are engaged in a fleet review with Boeing, and are taking up opportunities to accelerate fleet growth in 2018 and 2019 by extending 10 of our planned lease returns in these years, and adding selectively to our current order where Boeing may have some delivery opportunities over the next 24 months,” Ryanair said at the release of its 2016-17 full-year results. Speaking during the question and answer session of the results briefing in London, Ryanair CFO Neil Sorahan said talks are underway to extend leased aircraft into 2018 and into the summer of 2019. New aircraft are also an option, as is retaining older aircraft that were slated to be sold and leave the fleet post 2020-21. “We’ve said to Boeing that if they have two or three aircraft at the right price, we would be more than happy to pick up those slots,” Sorahan said. “We’re in negotiations; we are not over the line yet.” This will give Ryanair “more firepower” for opportunities created by “deep restructuring” at competitor airlines, such as Etihad equity partners Alitalia and airberlin, which Ryanair chief marketing officer Kenny Jacobs said “will continue to get smaller.” “We are aware of the need to have additional short-haul aircraft to respond quickly as these unique growth opportunities arise,” Ryanair said. Ryanair also named Poland and Romania as other targets. One area for fleet growth will be Ryanair’s new Polish charter airline, Ryanair Sun. This airline will launch in summer 2018 under its own air operator’s certificate with a fleet of five aircraft, growing to 15 aircraft by summer 2019. Sorahan told ATW  the new charter airline is purely a niche market opportunity in Eastern Europe—it is unrelated to Brexit and does not form part of a wider plan. Over the last five weeks, Ryanair CCO David O’Brien said the team has met with 180 airports, all of which were willing to improve their proposals to attract Ryanair growth. Ryanair posted a 94% average load factor for 2016-17, demonstrating to airports that the LCC is a “reliable partner” when it comes to delivering aircraft filled with passengers, O’Brien said. Under the existing fleet plan, Ryanair will grow its fleet to 427 aircraft by March 2018. In 2019 the fleet will total 448 aircraft, growing to 481 in 2020, 516 aircraft in 2021, 540 in 2022, 575 in 2023 and 585 in 2024. Ryanair already has Boeing 737 MAXs on order, which will begin arriving in autumn 2019.

REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson/Files 1/2 left right People attend the Bombardier stand during the European Business Aviation Convention & Exhibition (EBACE) at Cointrin airport in Geneva, Switzerland, May 22, 2017. REUTERS/Denis Balibouse/Files 2/2 OTTAWA Canada's defence minister, Harjit Sajjan, said on Wednesday that Boeing Co will be a trusted military ally in decades to come, but that its anti-dumping petition against Bombardier Inc is not behavior expected of a partner. Sajjan called on Boeing to abandon the anti-dumping challenge it has launched against Canadian plane maker Bombardier, saying Ottawa was disappointed by the U.S. company's behavior. Canada has threatened to scrap plans to buy Boeing fighter jets over the dispute. "We have a longstanding relationship with Boeing, and as I stated, we're hoping that this can be resolved in a ... manner that respects everyone," Sajjan told reporters on the sidelines of a defence industry event in Ottawa. Boeing accuses Bombardier of selling airliners in the U.S. market at artificially low prices. In response to Sajjan's request to withdraw the petition, Boeing spokesman Dan Curran said by email that "this is a commercial matter that Boeing is seeking to address through the normal course for resolving such issues." Earlier this month, in response to Boeing's challenge at the U.S. International Trade Commission, Canada said it was reviewing the planned purchase of 18 Boeing Super Hornet jets.. When asked whether Ottawa would scrap the order if Boeing failed to drop its complaint, Sajjan said "we need to let the process take its course." The Super Hornets are needed as an interim measure until Ottawa can run a competition to replace its aging fleet of CF-18 fighters. "The interim fleet procurement requires a trusted industry partner. For decades, Boeing has been an outstanding partner with the Canadian Armed Forces ... I expect that to be the case in the decades to come," he said during a speech. "However, our government is of the view that their action against Bombardier is unfounded. It is not the behavior we expect of a trusted partner, and we call on Boeing to withdraw it."

"Aseman Airlines has recently signed an MoU with the Boeing company to buy 30 Boeing 737 planes but finalization of the contract depends on permission of OFAC (the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the US Department of the Treasury)," Secretary of Iranian Airlines Association Maqsoud Asa'adi Samani said. CEO of Iran's national flag carrier, Iran Air, Farhad Parvaresh announced in April that Boeing will deliver its first passenger plane to the country early next year. "The first Boeing 777 jumbo jet will be handed over to Iran in April 2018," Parvaresh told reporters. In a relevant development in early April, Iran signed a new agreement with Boeing to purchase several twinjet narrow-body passenger planes. The agreement was signed between Iran's Aseman Airlines and Boeing and involves the purchase of 30 Boeing 737 MAX planes. The agreement came after almost a year of negotiations between Aseman Airlines and Boeing. Boeing is to provide 50 planes of the same type to Iran Air through a similar agreement. The overall value of Iran Air’s order that also involves 30 long-range wide-body 777 aircraft is estimated to be $16.6 billion. The planes are expected to be delivered to Aseman Airlines from 2019. The Iranian airline is expected to receive at least five of the purchased aircraft during the same year. Boeing 737 MAX planes - that would enter service in the second half of 2017 – have a passenger capacity of 130 people and are specifically adequate for domestic and regional flights. The planes that Aseman Airlines has purchased from Boeing would increase the company’s passenger transportation capacity to above 8,000 seats. Iran Air said in December 2016 that it had finalized an agreement with Boeing to buy 80 new planes. The company accordingly announced that Boeing would start to deliver the planes in 2018 and the deliveries would be completed within 10 years. Iran has already received the first three of a total of 100 Airbus planes that it has purchased from the European company through an agreement worth around $18 billion. More deliveries are expected to take place over the next months.         LATEST STORIES (10) Saudi Onslaught against Shiites Continues in Awamiyah Adding to Chaos: US Sending More Arms to Imperial Foot Soldiers in Syria Syrian Pro-Government Forces Advance in Strategic Area of Helba Southeast of Palmyra Syria: Drone Footage Shows Russian Navy's Missile Strikes on ISIL Positions Hashid Al-Shaabi on Border with Syria to Begin Operation against ISIL Philippines' Troops Push against ISIL in Marawi City Syria: Army in Heavy Clashes with Militants in Eastern Ghouta More Than 60 Killed by Massive Car Bomb in Kabul's Diplomatic Quarter Iraqis' Lives inside Hassansham U2 Camp during Ramadan Massive Explosion in Kabul's Diplomatic Quarter Leaves at Least 64 Dead, 300 Injured Official: Any Restriction on Sales of Passenger Planes to Iran Violates N.

Arnold Bunch: Air Force to Get KC-46 Tanker Program Schedule Update in June Jane Edwards May 31, 2017 Latest News, Resources 57 Views Lt. Gen. Arnold Bunch, military deputy of the U.S. Air Force’s acquisition office, has said Boeing has begun a schedule risk evaluation and will update the service branch by the first week of June whether the KC-46 tanker aircraft program will face another phase of schedule delays, Defense News reported Tuesday. “Boeing’s design of several subsystems and production of conformed hardware are still pending [Federal Aviation Administration] approval, which is slowing flight test execution,” Bunch said in a written testimony Thursday before a House Armed Services subpanel. He noted that several test planes are still integrating design changes and that Boeing is likely to hand over the first aircraft by Sept. 12. Bunch also called on lawmakers to support further modernization work on the KC-135 aircraft and provide sufficient funds for the development of KC-Y and KC-Z planes as follow-on aircraft programs to KC-46A since the 179 new tankers will only replace less than half of the Air Force’s existing fleet of KC-135 and KC-10 aircraft. His testimony came two months after the Government Accountability Office released a report, which showed a 14-month delay in the delivery of the first 18 KC-46 tanker planes and nine air refueling pods.

B737 and A320 along with their recently launched variants would remain the growth engines of the winglets market in the narrow-body aerospace industry over the next five years.  In terms of winglet type, blended winglet dominates    the global aerospace winglets market, propelled by its certification in Boeing's best-selling aircraft program B737, however, advanced technology winglet is projected to witness the highest growth during the forecast period of 2017 - 2022. Blended winglets offer 3% to 5% increase in fuel efficiency as compared to the aircraft without the winglets. As per the study, North America is projected to remain the largest market for winglets during the forecast period, driven by the presence of assembly plants of Boeing and Bombardier. The region is also manufacturing capital of the aerospace industry with the presence of major composite part fabricators and raw material suppliers. Asia-Pacific is the fastest-growing winglets market over the next five years, driven by upcoming commercial and regional aircraft with winglets as an option and high commercial aircraft fleet size.  The key winglet manufacturers are FACC AG, Korean Air Aerospace Division, RUAG Aerostructures, GKN Aerospace, Winglet Technology LLC, and BLR Aerospace LLC.

The author of the report stated that increasing production rate of commercial and regional aircraft, certification of winglets as a standard equipment in the variants of the best-selling aircraft, such as B737 Max and A320neo family, increasing adoption rate of winglets by airlines in both the new as well as retrofit installations, winglet technology advancement, and increasing fleet size are the key drivers of the global aerospace winglets market. The research's findings suggest that narrow-body aircraft is likely to remain the largest and the fastest-growing segment of the global aerospace winglets market during the forecast period of 2017 - 2022. B737 and A320 along with their recently launched variants would remain the growth engines of the winglets market in the narrow-body aerospace industry over the next five years.  In terms of winglet type, blended winglet dominates    the global aerospace winglets market, propelled by its certification in Boeing's best-selling aircraft program B737, however, advanced technology winglet is projected to witness the highest growth during the forecast period of 2017 - 2022. Blended winglets offer 3% to 5% increase in fuel efficiency as compared to the aircraft without the winglets. As per the study, North America is projected to remain the largest market for winglets during the forecast period, driven by the presence of assembly plants of Boeing and Bombardier. The region is also manufacturing capital of the aerospace industry with the presence of major composite part fabricators and raw material suppliers. Asia-Pacific is the fastest-growing winglets market over the next five years, driven by upcoming commercial and regional aircraft with winglets as an option and high commercial aircraft fleet size.  The key winglet manufacturers are FACC AG, Korean Air Aerospace Division, RUAG Aerostructures, GKN Aerospace, Winglet Technology LLC, and BLR Aerospace LLC. New product development, collaboration with OEMs, and formation of long-term contracts with OEMs are the key strategies adopted by the key players to gain a competitive edge in the market.  Click Here and Ask for Free Sample on 202 Pages Aerospace Winglets Market Report Report Features  This report provides market intelligence in the most comprehensive way.

The airline took the delivery of its 30th Boeing 777-300ER that welcomed with a traditional water salute. The 777-300ER’ arrival, the latest addition to the European carrier’s growing fleet of more than 100 Boeing airplanes, also comes into prominence as a highly significant delivery for the carrier as it is the first aircraft to feature seats by Turkish Seats Industries (TSI), a complete Turkish brand through a close collaboration with Boeing. TSI, the first locally aircraft seat producer in Turkey, which is a joint venture between Turkish Airlines and Assan Hanil, aims to play a key role in the global aircraft seat market with its innovative, lightweight, quality products. “While consistently investing in its overall services, Turkish Airlines has always put special emphasis to further built in its infrastructure investments which also make a major contribution to further progress of Turkish Aviation Industry. Three years ago, we partnered in a significant initiative to pioneer another first in Turkish Civil Aviation. By establishing Turkish Seat Industry (TSI), in collaboration with Assan Hanil, we took a more active role in the industry through logistical support. And now we’re taking the delivery of the first aircraft equipped with those locally produced seats designed by TSI, an installation manufactured in Turkey that conforms to all international standards. With adding this 30th Boeing 777-300ER to our ever expanding fleet, we look forward to TSI to become a leading brand across the industry, and be a substantial part of our aircrafts in the near future.” said M. İlker Aycı, Chairman of the Board and the Executive Committee of Turkish Airlines. Commenting this delivery, Can Şaşmaz, General Manager of TSI, said; “TSI have completed the delivery of economy class seats for a Turkish Airlines’ B777 aircraft which is registered as TC-JLK and with a MSN number 60402, where TSI have completed the design, certification and production of the seats earlier than Boeing’s prediction. As TSI, we are honoured and proud to be an important part of Turkish Aviation History and supply seats to iconic Boeing B777 aircraft, in addition to gain the Turkey’ national flag carrier’, Turkish Airlines’ confidence in supporting the airlines aircraft, to note the airline has one of the youngest aircraft fleet currently in operation worldwide.” “Turkish Airlines has been a long-standing and key partner for Boeing and we are proud of their confidence and trust in Boeing’s technology and industry-leading airplanes such as the 777,” said Marty Bentrott, Vice President for Sales, Middle East, Turkey, Russia and Central Asia, Boeing Commercial Airplanes. “This delivery is especially significant since it is the first to feature seats by Turkish Seat Industries (TSI). We look forward to further developing and strengthening our relationship with Turkish Airlines and the Turkish Aviation Industry.”  Turkish Airlines and Boeing share a long history that goes back to 1945, with the arrival of the airline’s first DC-3/C-47 airliners. Turkish Airlines entered the jet age in the late 1960s, when the airline began operating DC-9, DC-10 and Boeing 707 airplanes. Over the years, the Turkish carrier has also flown the Boeing 727, 757, MD-80 and the most modern 737 and 777 airplanes. Boeing’s backlog with Turkish Airlines includes two 777 Freighters and 75 737 MAXs.  Join Albawaba Business Follow Albawaba Business Rate Article: Select ratingPoorOkayGoodGreatAwesome   Tweet comment (0) Share: Facebook Twitter Google+ Linkedin Pinterest Delicious Stumbleupon Digg Reddit EDITOR’S CHOICE 1 - 4 OF 12 Solar-Powered Hospitals Are Saving Lives in Syria N.J.

(Photo: Wavebreakmedia Ltd./Dreamstime) Share article on Facebookshare Tweet articletweet Plus one article on Google Plus+1 Print Article Adjust font size AA AA AA AA AA AA AA by Jonathan S. Tobin May 31, 2017 4:00 AM @jonathans_tobin On his first official trip abroad, the president rallied Arabs and Israelis to unite against Iran. But by giving Boeing a pass to sell Tehran planes, he’s sending a very different message. During his trip to the Middle East last week, President Donald Trump had one consistent theme and he never wavered from it: The region needs to unite to stop Iran. Mutual antipathy for Tehran has driven Arab regimes such as Saudi Arabia to make common cause with Israel. It was also the motivation for the massive $110 billion arms deal Trump struck with the Saudis, who believe that President Obama’s nuclear agreement with Iran has endangered their security. But while Trump talks tough about the Iranians, the normally bellicose Islamist regime has been restrained, at least by its standards, in response. Why? The Iranians may be unhappy with Trump’s effort to orchestrate the creation of a Middle East NATO that would oppose their dream of regional hegemony, but they are actually quite pleased with other elements of his administration’s Iran policy. For all of Trump’s bluster, his decision not only to leave the nuclear agreement in place but to erect no obstacles to a major U.S. commercial deal with Iran may have convinced the ayatollahs that the president isn’t quite as hostile as he wants to seem. One of the least noticed aspects of the nuclear deal was a provision that granted Tehran an exception to U.S. sanctions that remained in place after it was signed. That provision allowed U.S. companies to sell “commercial passenger aircraft and related parts and services” to Iran, and Boeing took advantage of it, joining European businesses in a race to secure Iranian business. It was a clever strategy that enabled Obama to undermine the remaining resistance to the deal. If, as Obama hoped, a major U.S. firm such as Boeing were to conclude a massive deal of its own with Iran, the jobs created by the sale would build a strong new constituency opposed to retightening the screws on Tehran no matter the regime’s subsequent actions. Boeing’s deal with Iran was concluded in June 2016, and the Obama administration subsequently issued the requisite licenses for it to move forward. But the Trump administration still has a chance to raise objections and to block the delivery of the planes to Tehran. The grounds for objection were already clear last year, when Boeing was celebrating the deal: Many of the companies with which it would be doing business have strong connections to or are owned by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), which coordinates Iran’s international terrorist network. Yet so far, the Trump administration has remained suspiciously silent about the deal, leading Iran to the not unreasonable conclusion that while the president may be willing to talk about its role as the world’s leading state sponsor of terror, he is as reluctant to do something about it as his predecessor was. There’s a glaring contradiction between Trump’s indulgence of Boeing’s desire to profit from its dealings with Iran and his efforts to rein in a dangerous foe of U.S. interests. Trump has no good options when it comes to tearing up the nuclear deal that he spent so much of the 2016 campaign denouncing as a betrayal of U.S. interests. Walking away from the pact at a moment when neither America’s European allies nor Russia and China are willing to re-impose sanctions would simply give the Iranians permission to move quickly toward a bomb without providing a means short of war to stop them. But Trump does have options that can start the process of rebuilding an international quarantine against Iranian terror and punishing the regime for its illegal missile tests. Earlier this month, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee passed a sweeping set of measures designed to impose new restrictions on trade with Iran because of its human-rights violations and support for terror. The point of such efforts is to expand the list of Iranian individuals and companies affected by the sanctions that still remain in place, so as to hamper the ability of the IRGC and other agents of the regime to profit from foreign trade. Moreover, even if other nations won’t re-impose their own sanctions on Iran, U.S. measures that bar foreign banks from the American financial system if they do business with terror-connected Iranian entities can still have a devastating impact on the regime. President Trump mocked John Kerry as the worst negotiator in history for his disastrous role in making the nuclear pact possible. But if he doesn’t move to support the Senate bill and to do something about the Boeing deal, then he will effectively be throwing in his lot with Obama’s secretary of state, who remains a public opponent of increased sanctions on Iran. The reason for Trump’s reluctance to move against Boeing is obvious: Promises to create American jobs were as important to the success of his campaign as were his criticisms of Obama. Putting any further obstacles in the way of the transaction would have a devastating impact on the company and the thousands of workers it employs. Moreover, Boeing is looking to expand its ties with Iran and has applied for another license to sell 30 more planes to entities within the country. But Iran uses commercial planes such as the ones Boeing sells to ferry supplies, munitions, and “volunteers” to Syria, where they have helped preserve the rule of the barbarous Assad regime. No one in the White House can pretend that Boeing’s budding business relationship with the Islamic Republic is unrelated to the security concerns that Trump discussed with the Saudis and Israelis last week. All of which is to say that there’s a glaring contradiction between Trump’s indulgence of Boeing’s desire to profit from its dealings with Iran and his efforts to rein in a dangerous foe of U.S. interests. If he stays silent and/or allows the planes to be delivered, it may preserve jobs for some of the working-class voters who backed him. But it will also validate Tehran’s belief that he is as much a paper tiger as Obama was. And an Iran unfettered by fear of U.S. power, hard and soft, would be an even bigger threat to global security.

Deutsch News provided by Hainan Airlines Co., LTD 31 May, 2017, 02:29 ET Share this article The plane featuring a design by young American designer Hannah Foss takes its inaugural flight, in celebration of the Chinese airline's 24th anniversary BEIJING, May 31, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- A Hainan Airlines' Dreamliner, adorned with Po, the main character in the Kung Fu Panda film, and the famous panda's friends, took off on the inaugural flight for its new service HU7181, from Haikou to Beijing, on the morning of May 29, 2017. As the Chinese airline's third Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner in the fleet to receive the "King Fu Panda" makeover, the eye-catching yellow-colored airplane started its maiden flight to the cheers of the crowd. Hainan Airlines’ third Kung Fu Panda-themed plane starts its maiden flight Hannah Foss, the winner of Hainan Airlines’ Design Your Own Livery contest in North America, visits the airline’s hangar A group photo of Hainan Airlines’ flight attendants with Hannah Foss The flight carried a special passenger, Hannah Foss, a young designer from the state of Alaska. When Hannah Foss submitted her "Kung Fu Panda"-themed Dreamliner design last September, she was one of nearly 3,000 online entries that all shared the same dream: To have their design painted on a real-life, Hainan Airlines Boeing 787 Dreamliner. That dream started several months ago when Hainan, Boeing and DreamWorks announced a partnership that would include the introduction of six specially-painted Dreamliners over the next two years, featuring characters and scenes from the popular animated franchise. "I have loved painting and designing since I was a child. I have designed a dinosaur exhibition for a museum and depicted the Northern lights around the Arctic Circle in my artwork. But I never thought that my design would be painted on a plane someday. It feels amazing! This is the first time that I have come to China, taken a Boeing Dreamliner and witnessed the process of the painting of a plane. I really appreciate these "firsts" that Hainan Airlines has offered to me," Ms. Foss said as part of a speech she gave over the plane's announcement system during which she shared her thrilling story with the over 200 passengers on the flight. "This is an exceptional journey for me, giving many Americans like myself the opportunity to learn about Hainan Airlines and better understand the distinguished Chinese company's idea of cherishing every person's dream in addition to its ongoing commitment to fulfilling dreams." Hannah grew up in Adelaide, South Australia and moved to Alaska in 2008.    Some of her adventures include spending several years as a paleontological artist, CGI-animating a couple of museum films, constructing a 16-ft long dinosaur puppet called Snaps, eating tasty muktuk, snow-machining on the Chukchi Sea and meeting a polar bear. In addition to having her design painted on a Dreamlinerand to be part of this amazing journey, Hannah won two round-trip, business class tickets to China, as well as a weeks' accommodations at a luxury hotel. The "Kung Fu Panda" story is deeply rooted in traditional Chinese culture and history. Hannah's design wove together popular characters like Po and Tigress, with traditional Chinese "chops" and a painted sunrise. The design was awarded the top prize based on its originality, creativity, humor, its reflection of Chinese culture, and its wow factor. When Hannah's design is painted onto the new Dreamliner, the airplane will fly several of Hainan's more than 40 nonstop routes between China and North America. It will join two other specially painted airplanes, the first of which touched down at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport last year. That airplane carried over 100 students and teachers from Lincoln High School in Tacoma, WA, who were returning from a life-changing, 11-day trip to China. Hainan Airlines is proud to partner with DreamWorks and Boeing to bring the "Kung Fu Panda" franchise to Hainan's elite service and premier experience. Look forward for more partnerships like this in the future, and be sure to keep an eye out for #TheFlyingPanda throughout our North American network! Hainan Airlines has continued with its strategy of working hand-in-hand with the Chinese government's One Belt, One Road initiative as part of its overall plan to aggressively expand its presence in international markets. Nevertheless, despite the complexities of operating in the highly competitive international markets, the airline has never wavered from its original set of goals of consistently combining the brand's unique Oriental hospitality with modern service standards, a concept which is embodied in the Kung Fu Panda planes. The airline has promoted its image in the global aviation market through the cooperation with DreamWorks, demonstrating the newfound stature of Chinese companies on the world stage while allowing travelers everywhere to gain a better understanding of Chinese culture and its richness.   To view the original version on PR Newswire, visit:http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/hainan-airlines-unveils-third-kung-fu-panda-themed-plane-as-part-of-collaboration-with-dreamworks-animation-300466031.html SOURCE Hainan Airlines Co., LTD 31 May, 2017, 08:12 ET Preview: Hainan Airlines dévoile son troisième avion aux couleurs de Kung Fu Panda dans le cadre de sa collaboration avec DreamWorks Animation 20 May, 2017, 12:16 ET Preview: Hainan Airlines continúa ofreciendo una mejor experiencia a los pasajeros My News Release contains wide tables.

DreamWorks Animation News provided by Hainan Airlines Co., LTD 31 May, 2017, 07:59 BST Share this article The plane featuring a design by young American designer Hannah Foss takes its inaugural flight, in celebration of the Chinese airline's 24th anniversary BEIJING, May 31, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- A Hainan Airlines' Dreamliner, adorned with Po, the main character in the Kung Fu Panda film, and the famous panda's friends, took off on the inaugural flight for its new service HU7181, from Haikou to Beijing, on the morning of May 29, 2017. As the Chinese airline's third Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner in the fleet to receive the "King Fu Panda" makeover, the eye-catching yellow-colored airplane started its maiden flight to the cheers of the crowd. Hainan Airlines’ third Kung Fu Panda-themed plane starts its maiden flight Hannah Foss, the winner of Hainan Airlines’ Design Your Own Livery contest in North America, visits the airline’s hangar A group photo of Hainan Airlines’ flight attendants with Hannah Foss The flight carried a special passenger, Hannah Foss, a young designer from the state of Alaska. When Hannah Foss submitted her "Kung Fu Panda"-themed Dreamliner design last September, she was one of nearly 3,000 online entries that all shared the same dream: To have their design painted on a real-life, Hainan Airlines Boeing 787 Dreamliner. That dream started several months ago when Hainan, Boeing and DreamWorks announced a partnership that would include the introduction of six specially-painted Dreamliners over the next two years, featuring characters and scenes from the popular animated franchise. "I have loved painting and designing since I was a child. I have designed a dinosaur exhibition for a museum and depicted the Northern lights around the Arctic Circle in my artwork. But I never thought that my design would be painted on a plane someday. It feels amazing! This is the first time that I have come to China, taken a Boeing Dreamliner and witnessed the process of the painting of a plane. I really appreciate these "firsts" that Hainan Airlines has offered to me," Ms. Foss said as part of a speech she gave over the plane's announcement system during which she shared her thrilling story with the over 200 passengers on the flight. "This is an exceptional journey for me, giving many Americans like myself the opportunity to learn about Hainan Airlines and better understand the distinguished Chinese company's idea of cherishing every person's dream in addition to its ongoing commitment to fulfilling dreams." Hannah grew up in Adelaide, South Australia and moved to Alaska in 2008.    Some of her adventures include spending several years as a paleontological artist, CGI-animating a couple of museum films, constructing a 16-ft long dinosaur puppet called Snaps, eating tasty muktuk, snow-machining on the Chukchi Sea and meeting a polar bear. In addition to having her design painted on a Dreamlinerand to be part of this amazing journey, Hannah won two round-trip, business class tickets to China, as well as a weeks' accommodations at a luxury hotel. The "Kung Fu Panda" story is deeply rooted in traditional Chinese culture and history. Hannah's design wove together popular characters like Po and Tigress, with traditional Chinese "chops" and a painted sunrise. The design was awarded the top prize based on its originality, creativity, humor, its reflection of Chinese culture, and its wow factor. When Hannah's design is painted onto the new Dreamliner, the airplane will fly several of Hainan's more than 40 nonstop routes between China and North America. It will join two other specially painted airplanes, the first of which touched down at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport last year. That airplane carried over 100 students and teachers from Lincoln High School in Tacoma, WA, who were returning from a life-changing, 11-day trip to China. Hainan Airlines is proud to partner with DreamWorks and Boeing to bring the "Kung Fu Panda" franchise to Hainan's elite service and premier experience. Look forward for more partnerships like this in the future, and be sure to keep an eye out for #TheFlyingPanda throughout our North American network! Hainan Airlines has continued with its strategy of working hand-in-hand with the Chinese government's One Belt, One Road initiative as part of its overall plan to aggressively expand its presence in international markets. Nevertheless, despite the complexities of operating in the highly competitive international markets, the airline has never wavered from its original set of goals of consistently combining the brand's unique Oriental hospitality with modern service standards, a concept which is embodied in the Kung Fu Panda planes. The airline has promoted its image in the global aviation market through the cooperation with DreamWorks, demonstrating the newfound stature of Chinese companies on the world stage while allowing travelers everywhere to gain a better understanding of Chinese culture and its richness.   Photo - https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/517732/3rd_Kung_Fu_Panda_themed_plane.jpg Photo - https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/517733/Hannah_Foss.jpg Photo - https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/517731/Hannah_Foss_with_crew.jpg   SOURCE Hainan Airlines Co., LTD 19 May, 2017, 13:18 BST Preview: Hainan Airlines continues to enhance the passenger experience My News Release contains wide tables.

Boeing cut nearly 1,600 jobs in the state in April, the biggest one month drop since January 2003. (Andy Bronson / The Herald) Aerospace blog Boeing continues to cut jobs, citing need to stay competitive Dan Catchpole Wed May 31st, 2017 9:14pm Business You must sign in or register to continue reading content. EVERETT — The Boeing Co.’s workforce in Washington dropped by 1,582 in April. That is the biggest month-over-month decline for the airplane maker since January 2003, when it cut approximately 1,800 jobs in the state, according to The Daily Herald’s analysis of employment data on Boeing’s website. At the time, the company was struggling through a downturn begun with the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, which sent airlines reeling as would-be flyers opted to stay grounded. Commercial aviation further was hammered by rising fuel prices, a global recession and other market challenges. As airlines canceled and delayed orders for new jetliners, Boeing slashed its Washington workforce from 80,000 in the fall of 2001 to 62,000 one year later. It bottomed out at 52,763 in June 2004. Boeing executives say the need to curb costs in a competitive market is driving the current paring down of jobs. In 2016, the company cut its global workforce by nearly 11,000. Most of that reduction — 7,357 jobs — came in Washington, where Boeing makes nearly all its commercial airplanes. Company leaders have said they expect to reduce jobs at about the same rate in 2017. Through the first four months of the year, Boeing has shed 2,823 jobs around Puget Sound, dropping to 69,058 on April 27, the most recent data available. After the downturn in the early 2000s, the company’s workforce in the state peaked at 87,023 by October 2012. At the time, it had 175,742 employees around the world, with the vast majority in the United States. Its global payroll by late April had 144,976, a decline of nearly 31,000. Most of the job reductions since early 2016 have come through buyouts, retirements and selective hiring freezes. The company had avoided major layoffs until this year. So far, it has issued 1,162 layoff notices to workers in Washington. That total includes a limited number of notices issued twice. The company has declined to say exactly how many workers have been affected. Dan Catchpole: 425-339-3454; dcatchpole@heraldnet.com.

REUTERS/Christian Hartmann/File PhotoMore By Tim Hepher PARIS (Reuters) - Russia's new jetliner, which conducted its maiden flight on Sunday, may have a hard time challenging the sales duopoly of Boeing and Airbus, but it does point the way to radical changes in how they could be building jets in the future. The MS-21, a new single aisle airliner produced by Russia's United Aircraft Corporation, is the first passenger plane borne aloft by lightweight carbon-composite wings built without a costly pressurized oven called an autoclave. The manufacturing process provides a test for a technology already being assessed by Western rivals, who are looking for cheaper and faster ways to build some of their aircraft with composites, according to aerospace executives and suppliers. Even as it sets up the world's largest autoclaves to make wings for its giant 777X, Boeing is exploring alternatives for its "New Midsize Airplane" (NMA), in the middle of the market between its big wide-body jets and best-selling 737. "There's a good chance part of the NMA will be built without autoclaves," a person familiar with the project said. A Boeing spokesman said it was studying mid-market opportunities and declined further comment. Sources say Boeing's choice of technology for its two-aircraft NMA family will lay the foundation for the next generation of its money-spinning 737, expected to appear from 2030 and last well into the second half of the century. Boeing has not yet discussed this part of its strategy publicly, but industry sources said it may include a trio of jets seating 160 to 210 people and built using broadly the same production system as the one developed for the NMA. Both families of planes are likely to be built for 30 years and stay in service for another 20-30. So today's technology choices represent a colossal 75-year bet. Airbus too is monitoring the technology as it considers how to respond to Boeing's mid-market jet, CNN reported last month. Airbus has declined to comment on the report. PIVOTAL DECISION Composites have been used in aviation since the 1970s but achieved a breakthrough in the past decade as the Boeing 787 Dreamliner and Airbus A350 entered service, promising to save money on fuel by replacing most metal parts with lighter carbon. Those are long-haul jets, which means that the savings on fuel are worthwhile even though the planes are expensive to build. For short-haul planes that burn less fuel, like the NMA or future 737, it is more important to find cheaper ways to build them, and avoiding the need for autoclaves could help. Betting on technology that does not require an autoclave is a gamble also for composite suppliers like U.S.-based Hexcel <HXL.N>, Solvay <SOLB.BR> of Belgium and Toray <3402.T> of Japan, whose share of aerospace manufacturing is growing. At a recent JEC composites fair in Paris, Hexcel and Solvay showcased out-of-autoclave prototype parts as they gear up to supply manufacturers on a bigger scale. "It's one of the big questions now in aerospace: how to produce out-of-autoclave on a large scale and at high speeds," said Henri Girardy, business development manager at Hexcel Composites, adding jetmakers would accept no cut in performance. Boeing's Dreamliner and the Airbus A350 are built from carbon fiber already impregnated with resin, called "prepreg", which is supplied to jetmakers, tailored by machines into plane parts and cured inside giant pressure-cooking autoclaves. Analysts say these parts cost around 30-40 percent more to produce than aluminum. Under the new technology, instead of using fiber that is pre-impregnated with resin, parts are made from a dry-fiber engineered textile which is placed in a mould and then infused with resin under a vacuum. The parts can then be cured in an oven without pressure, a process estimated to cost 25 percent more than metal. Ultimately, that gap needs to narrow significantly or disappear. Boatbuilders and windfarm makers have used this method for years. Secondary airplane parts have also been made that way. But although Canada's Bombardier partly used the technique for its CSeries, it was rare for flight-critical parts before the designers of the new Russian plane chose it for the wing. The MS-21 has yet to score large sales but has been able to catch onto the latest manufacturing wave at a time when Western giants are starting to think beyond their recently upgraded models to future designs. Read More "This is an excellent technology demonstrator because it is on a real programme and a primary-structure part," said Frank Nickisch, global director of strategic projects at Solvay Composite Materials, which provided materials for the MS-21. He noted that the wings on the MS-21 are of comparable size to a Boeing 737 or Airbus A320. Still, more needs to be done to bring down costs. And composite firms are not yet ready to support output at speeds planemakers have in mind. Industry sources say Boeing is expected to build 20-30 of its proposed mid-market planes a month, about twice the rate for the 787. Future 737 and A320 replacements are likely to be closer to the 60-80 mark. Nickisch said the proposed new Boeing middle-market aircraft would be a good test case for whether the industry can switch to a higher tempo using the widely expected composites. Yet tough planemaker targets on cost, performance and output require progress on three fronts: cheaper materials, wider automation and computer simulation to ensure new technology works first time, following widespread delays with new jet programmes. "Prepreg technology has been developing for 40 years, based on day-to-day knowledge. But to bring in a new process we need to be able to predict it first, with databanks," Girardy said.

Photo by David Pugliese Share Adjust Comment Print Boeing will announce its industry team members for the Super Hornet interim fighter jet project on Thursday at CANSEC 2017. On the Wednesday at CANSEC the Boeing team hopes to highlight the company’s long-term commitment to Canada. It’s done that in the past but this time around Boeing is trying to dig itself out of a self-inflicted public relations disaster. The firm has put the proposed Super Hornet purchase by Canada in jeopardy by convincing the U.S. Commerce Department and International Trade Commission to launch an investigation into Canadian aerospace firm Bombardier. The investigation will examine the dumping of commercial aircraft into the U.S. market. “The U.S. market is the most open in the world, but we must take action if our rules are being broken,” U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said in a statement after the hearing into Boeing’s claim. Boeing claims that Bombardier received subsidies, which in turn, allowed it to sell its C-Series aircraft at below-market prices. The Liberal government’s response? It has suggested it might not go ahead with the Super Hornet deal. Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland’s recent chastening of Boeing for its actions and promise to review military procurement involving Boeing leaves in limbo Canada’s purchase of 18 Super Hornet jets, a deal expected to cost $5 billion to $7 billion. Canada has not yet signed the deal to acquire the Super Hornets. That was expected to be in place by the end of the year or early next year.

Called the Experimental Spaceplane (XS-1) program, the new robotic spacecraft would be an autonomous, reusable spaceplane. The spaceplane would be used to lift a small expendable upper stage aloft to where it could launch a small satellite of about 3,000 pounds into low Earth orbit. “Phantom Express is designed to disrupt and transform the satellite launch process as we know it today, creating a new, on-demand space-launch capability that can be achieved more affordably and with less risk,” Darryl Davis, president of Boeing Phantom Works, said in a statement. The idea behind Phantom Express is that as a reusable spaceplane, it could be turned around and launched back into space quickly. Conventional rockets can be used just once while the U.S. Space Shuttle program—which was also reusable spaceplane—is a now a distant memory. But even then, the Shuttle did not have an especially quick turnaround time. Despite being decades newer, the Phantom Express will leverage some of the technology from the Space Shuttle program, which was developed during the 1970s. Indeed, the Phantom Express spaceplane’s engine technology is directly derived from the Space Shuttle. “The Aerojet Rocketdyne AR-22 engine, a version of the legacy Space Shuttle main engine, would power the spaceplane,” reads a Boeing statement. “It is designed to be reusable and operates using liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen fuel.” But while the Phantom Express reuses some of the Space Shuttle’s technology, it offers advances in other areas. It would offer a much more advanced airframe design as well as new third-generation thermal protection. But the air vehicle would be far smaller and lighter than the Space Shuttle—nor would it need to be built to withstand quite the same stresses as its predecessor. “Once the spaceplane – called Phantom Express – reaches the edge of space, it would deploy the second stage and return to Earth,” Boeing states. “It would then land on a runway to be prepared for its next flight by applying operation and maintenance principles similar to modern aircraft.” Boeing and DARPA are planning to jointly invest their money into the development of the Phantom Express. The two entities hope to conduct a demonstration of 10 flights over 10 days—a feat which is unprecedented. If the experiment works, the Phantom Express could be a revolution in space launch technology. Dave Majumdar is the defense editor for The National Interest.

Defense Minister Harjit Sajjan said Boeing's action against Bombardier is "unfounded" and not the behavior of a "trusted partner." He said yesterday buying the Super Hornet fighter jets "requires a trusted industry partner." Sajjan urged Boeing to withdraw the complaint in a speech. Canada's foreign minister has also threatened to block the order. "Our government - and I stress this - our government is disappointed in the action of one of our leading industry partners," he said. Chicago-based Boeing's trade complaint prompted a US Commerce Department anti-dumping investigation that could result in duties being imposed on Bombardier's new larger CSeries passenger aircraft. Boeing insists the plane receives Canadian government subsidies that give it an advantage internationally. Canada's threat is coming amid increasing trade disputes with the US Scott Day, a spokesman for Boeing, defended the company's trade action, suggesting it should not be linked to its military relationship with Canada. "It's more of a commercial issue with regard to the Bombardier case," he said. "We're going to continue working with the US Navy, providing information on the Super Hornet that will be provided to the government of Canada." Boeing petitioned the US Commerce Department and the US International Trade Commission to investigate subsidies of Montreal-based Bombardier's CSeries aircraft. Boeing says Bombardier has received more than USD 3 billion in government subsidies that let it engage in "predatory pricing." Brazil has also launched a formal complaint to the World Trade Organization over Canadian subsidies to Bombardier. Sao Paolo-based Embraer is a fierce rival of Bombardier's. The Quebec government invested US$1 billion in exchange for a 49.5 percent stake in the CSeries last year. Canada's federal government also recently provided a USD 275 million loan to Bombardier, which struggled to win orders for its new medium-size plane. But Bombardier won a 75-plane order for the CSeries from US-based Delta Air Lines in 2016. Bombardier said its planes never competed with Boeing in the sale to Delta.

Harjit Sajjan said Boeing’s action against Bombardier is “unfounded” and not the behavior of a “trusted partner.” He said buying the Super Hornet fighter jets “requires a trusted industry partner.” Sajjan urged Boeing to withdraw the complaint in a speech. Canada’s foreign minister has also threatened to block the order. “Our government - and I stress this - our government is disappointed in the action of one of our leading industry partners,” he said. Chicago-based Boeing’s trade complaint prompted a U.S. Commerce Department anti-dumping investigation that could result in duties being imposed on Bombardier’s new larger CSeries passenger aircraft. Boeing insists the plane receives Canadian government subsidies that give it an advantage internationally. Canada’s threat is coming amid increasing trade disputes with the U.S. Scott Day, a spokesman for Boeing, noted that Sajjan also recognized Boeing as a strong partner in the past and for the future. Day defended the company’s trade action. “This is a commercial matter that Boeing is seeking to address through the normal course for resolving such issues,” Day said in an email. Boeing petitioned the U.S. Commerce Department and the U.S. International Trade Commission to investigate subsidies of Montreal-based Bombardier’s CSeries aircraft. Boeing says Bombardier has received more than US$3 billion in government subsidies that let it engage in “predatory pricing.” Brazil has also launched a formal complaint to the World Trade Organization over Canadian subsidies to Bombardier. Sao Paolo-based Embraer is a fierce rival of Bombardier’s. The Quebec government invested US$1 billion in exchange for a 49.5 percent stake in the CSeries last year. Canada’s federal government also recently provided a US$275 million loan to Bombardier, which struggled to win orders for its new medium-size plane. But Bombardier won a 75-plane order for the CSeries from U.S.-based Delta Air Lines in 2016. Bombardier said its planes never competed with Boeing in the sale to Delta. The Canadian government said late last year it would enter into discussions on buying 18 Super Hornet jet fighters from Boeing on an interim basis and hold an open competition to buy more planes over the next five years. Canada remains part of Lockheed Martin’s F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program. Sajjan said he would have more to say about the issue next week. Copyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Harjit Sajjan said Boeing's action against Bombardier is "unfounded" and not the behavior of a "trusted partner." He said buying the Super Hornet fighter jets "requires a trusted industry partner." Sajjan urged Boeing to withdraw the complaint in a speech. Canada's foreign minister has also threatened to block the order. "Our government - and I stress this - our government is disappointed in the action of one of our leading industry partners," he said. Chicago-based Boeing's trade complaint prompted a U.S. Commerce Department anti-dumping investigation that could result in duties being imposed on Bombardier's new larger CSeries passenger aircraft. Boeing insists the plane receives Canadian government subsidies that give it an advantage internationally. Canada's threat is coming amid increasing trade disputes with the U.S. Scott Day, a spokesman for Boeing, noted that Sajjan also recognized Boeing as a strong partner in the past and for the future. Day defended the company's trade action. "This is a commercial matter that Boeing is seeking to address through the normal course for resolving such issues," Day said in an email. Boeing petitioned the U.S. Commerce Department and the U.S. International Trade Commission to investigate subsidies of Montreal-based Bombardier's CSeries aircraft. Boeing says Bombardier has received more than US$3 billion in government subsidies that let it engage in "predatory pricing." Brazil has also launched a formal complaint to the World Trade Organization over Canadian subsidies to Bombardier. Sao Paolo-based Embraer is a fierce rival of Bombardier's. The Quebec government invested US$1 billion in exchange for a 49.5 percent stake in the CSeries last year. Canada's federal government also recently provided a US$275 million loan to Bombardier, which struggled to win orders for its new medium-size plane. But Bombardier won a 75-plane order for the CSeries from U.S.-based Delta Air Lines in 2016. Bombardier said its planes never competed with Boeing in the sale to Delta. The Canadian government said late last year it would enter into discussions on buying 18 Super Hornet jet fighters from Boeing on an interim basis and hold an open competition to buy more planes over the next five years. Canada remains part of Lockheed Martin's F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program. Sajjan said he would have more to say about the issue next week.Associated Press Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.

For The Boeing Co. (NYSE: BA) that has been something of a headache because the company doesn’t sell a commercial jet for anywhere near that price. But in an agreement announced last Friday, the U.S. manufacturer struck a deal with Italy’s SACE SpA to under which the Italian financial firm will guarantee up to $1.25 billion in loans to finance purchases of new Boeing airplanes. In its announcement of the deal, SACE noted that Boeing purchased $2.5 billion in goods and services from 2015 to 2016 from Italian firms and supported 12,000 jobs in the country. Boeing has about 150 direct employees in Italy according to the announcement. The Ex-Im’s charter was renewed in December 2016, but because no new appointments have been made to the bank’s board it can not authorize a loan or a guarantee valued at more than $10 million.The bank’s rules require a quorum of 60% of its nominal five members in order to make larger deals. The board now has just two members. Some U.S. Senators have blocked new appointments to the board, arguing that the bank is no more than the “Bank of Boeing.” U.S. airlines, not eligible for Ex-Im financing guarantees, also argued against renewing the bank’s charter. President Trump took office opposed to the Ex-Im bank, but after meeting with Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg reportedly changed his mind. That change has not yet filtered down to the Senate nor has it resulted in the President nominating new members to the bank’s board. According to a report in The Wall Street Journal, SACE completed its first deal this month, providing guarantees of around $300 million for three Boeing 737-800s that have been sold to Turkey’s SunExpress. The planes have a list price of $98 million, but the actual price would likely have been 30% or so less than that. Italian aerospace company Leonardo supplies about 14% of the parts, including the center and rear fuselage sections, for Boeing’s 787 Dreamliner at the company’s plant near Taranto. This is Boeing’s first deal with a non-U.S. financial firm to help it finance aircraft purchases. One odd thing about the refusal to appoint new members to the Ex-Im bank’s board is that the bank turns a profit and makes or guarantees loans to hundreds of small U.S. firms.

"I'm looking at the new high list for the S&P 500 today, and you know what I saw? I like what I saw, which is a broad distribution among the 70 companies that hit this august list — 70 out of 500 making new highs," the "Mad Money" host said on Wednesday. While the rally may feel tech-driven, Cramer noticed that only 11 of the 70 companies that hit new highs were tech stocks, mostly from the semiconductor space. Of the rest, 23 were utility companies, an understandable group to be hitting new highs considering the market's worries about a slowing U.S. economy. Watch the full segment here: show chapters Cramer takes to the new high list to prove the rally is wider than it seems    15 Hours Ago | 11:50 "But that leaves 36 stocks that have nothing to do with tech or utilities rallying today, and those are where I gain solace, solace that perhaps things aren't as narrow or as unhealthy as they seem to so many," Cramer said. First, he turned to 3M, an industrial conglomerate that has consistently delivered strong results for shareholders. "I've often called 3M what I call 'a core holding,' meaning it's a stock you never want to sell if you can avoid it," the "Mad Money" host said. "3M is exactly the kind of stock you want on the new high list if you're concerned about a rally being too narrow." Boeing, the largest aerospace company in the world, also hit a new high. Cramer pointed out that as one of the United States' biggest exporters, Boeing would not be able to sell its products if the economy was dramatically slowing. Cramer also noticed that railroad operator CSX was on the list, which would also not be outperforming if the cargo industry was on the verge of collapse. Even with the appointment of new CEO Hunter Harrison, which gave the stock a boost, Cramer takes CSX's success as a sign of strength in commerce. Consumer strength was illuminated by Carnival Corporation's place on the list. Cramer called the cruise line "the ultimate in discretionary spending," meaning that customers do not need to spend on cruises, but since they are, the consumer cannot be as weak as some may think. "And then there's the clinchers, frankly: McDonald's, Yum [Brands] and Starbucks. These are three classic growth names that have all the same concerns: labor costs going up, strong dollar liabilities, higher price-to-earnings multiples than we might otherwise expect. But they're all hitting the new high list nonetheless," Cramer said. Some sectors makes the "Mad Money" host uneasy. One is the downtrodden bank stocks, which have been lower on negative effects of trading, and the oil stocks. "The oils? If you own 'em, it's deathly," he said. "The fact is, there's too much oil. On the other hand, though, I think the group has already gotten pretty cheap. The oils represent value here and that's not a sin." And while retail has been a consistent, market-wide concern, Cramer said that Wal-Mart and Costco's successes are at least challenging Amazon's domination. "Sure, it's easy to point endlessly to the coming FANG apocalypse," Cramer said. "I just want to point out that when you look at the new high list, it's about as broad as you could ask, sans the utilities and their safe dividends. That doesn't mean we should break out the party hats. It does mean that we're in less dangerous territory than many people now think after five fabulous months of 2017 market action."

Dassault Aviation, Boeing, SAAB and Rosoboronexport have responded to the global request for information (RFI) issued in January this year. New Delhi (Sputnik) – Apart from some basic guidelines for procurement, the Indian Navy had sought answers on a range of issues like electronic warfare capability, endurance and payload. The Navy is also desirous of licensed production of the aircraft after acquiring transfer of technology in the case. "We have received the reply from all the four to whom RFI had been issued. Now, we will examine the RFI and will take it forward," Admiral Sunil Lanba, Indian Navy chief said on Wednesday. Multi-role fighters are intended as day-night capable; all-weather multi-role deck based combat aircraft which can be used for air defense, air-to-surface operations, buddy refueling, reconnaissance, and EW missions from Indian Naval aircraft carriers. Solicitation issued on January had asked global vendors if it can perform Short Take-off But Arrested Recovery (STOBAR) or Catapult Take-off But Arrested Recovery (CATOBAR) operations, or both. Swedish SAAB is pitching its single engine Sea Gripen which has capability to operate from both STOBAR/CATOBAR while Russian upgraded MiG-29K can operate from STOBAR. Boeing's F/A-18E/F Super Hornet and Dassault's Rafale M are also in the fray for approximately $15 billion contract. Indian Navy is expected to issue the tender soon following the go-ahead signal from the government. "Hopefully, we will select and shall have deck-based carrier airborne fighter in next 4-5 years," Admiral Lanba added. The selected aircraft will operate from indigenously developed IAC-1 aircraft carrier which will be conventional ski jump based STOBAR layout and INS Vikramaditya. "The IAC-1 which is under-construction at the moment is going as per the timeline and she will start her trial in 2019, we will take delivery in 2020," Admiral Lanba said. © Sputnik NEWSLETTER Join the GlobalSecurity.org mailing list Enter Your Email Address   Advertise with Us | About Us | GlobalSecurity.org In the News | Internships | Site Map | Privacy Copyright © 2000-2017 GlobalSecurity.org All rights reserved.

Environment Minister Catherine McKenna would only say Wednesday that Canada remains committed to the Paris Accord, refusing to speculate about U.S. President Donald Trump's musings about withdrawing from the agreement. "Canada's just going to keep marching on, like the rest of the world," McKenna told an event in Toronto. McKenna has said what the U.S. chooses to do is up to the U.S., but Canada won't wait. Last week in Germany, McKenna met with Chinese special envoy for climate change Xie Zhenhua and European Union environment commissioner Karmenu Vella, where they discussed jointly hosting a meeting of environment ministers this fall to chart a path for implementing Paris among the world's major economies. It very likely will take place in Canada, around the same time as the United Nations General Assembly, which starts in New York City on Sept. 12. Currently the U.S. is not part of that group. "Canada is going to show leadership with China and the EU and we certainly hope the U.S. will be joining us," McKenna told The Canadian Press in a recent interview. ——— WETTLAUFER EXPECTED TO PLEAD GUILTY TO MURDER CHARGES: A former Ontario nurse accused of killing eight seniors in her care is expected to plead guilty to first-degree murder charges in their deaths at a court appearance on Thursday. Elizabeth Wettlaufer currently faces a total of 14 charges, including eight counts of first-degree murder, four counts of attempted murder and two counts of aggravated assault. Police have alleged those crimes involved the use of certain drugs and took place over the last decade in three Ontario long-term care facilities where Wettlaufer worked as a registered nurse, and at a private home. A source close to the case tells The Canadian Press that Wettlaufer is scheduled to plead guilty to eight counts of first-degree murder in a Woodstock, Ont., court on Thursday. Wettlaufer's defence lawyer did not respond to requests for comment on the expected development. A spokeswoman with Ontario's Ministry of the Attorney General says "significant developments" are expected in the case on Thursday, but did not provide further details. ——— DEATH OF ASYLUM SEEKER 'GREATEST FEAR': Officials with an organization that helps asylum seekers say their biggest concern has been that someone could die while trying to illegally cross into Canada. Now a woman, who American officials say may have been trying to reach Manitoba on foot from the United States, has been found dead in a remote part of northwestern Minnesota. "This has been our greatest fear all along, is that people are risking their lives to make this crossing," said Maj. Rob Kerr with the Salvation Army in Winnipeg. "It's surprising now that it's happened at this point in time, at the end of May. It was our greatest fear back in February, March when it was so cold out." The Kittson County sheriff's office says the body of Mavis Otuteye, 57, was found Friday in a field close to the Canadian border near the Minnesota town of Noyes. Authorities believe Otuteye was a citizen of Ghana in western Africa. Chief deputy Matt Vig told WDAZ-TV that Otuteye was reported missing a day earlier and was likely heading to Canada on foot to try to reunite with her daughter. He said Otuteye had been living in Delaware for the last several years. Final autopsy results were pending, but Vig said preliminary results indicate she died of hypothermia. The officer said part of her body was in a shallow pool of water in a drainage ditch. ——— BUSINESS LEADERS EXPRESS CONCERN AFTER B.C. ELECTION: Some business leaders in Canada are expressing concerns that the fallout from British Columbia's election is discouraging the private sector from investing in the province. Val Litwin, the president of the B.C. Chamber of Commerce, says the promises in NDP-Green agreement to block the Trans Mountain expansion, review the Site C dam, increase the hourly minimum wage to at least $15 and hike the carbon tax have done little to calm investor nerves. Litwin says he hopes the NDP, should it form a minority government with the help of the Greens, would consult with businesses before making tax changes or raising the minimum wage as they would end up paying those costs. Gary Leach, the president of the Explorers and Producers Association of Canada, says the resolution to immediately stop Kinder Morgan's Trans Mountain expansion project would send a chilling message to investors across Canada. Liberal Premier Christy Clark has said she will recall the provincial legislature in June where she expects a confidence vote will result in the probable defeat of her government. The Liberals won 43 seats in the May 9 election, one shy of a majority, but the formal, four-year agreement between the Greens and NDP would give them 44 seats, handing them a one-seat majority. ——— SAJJAN BLASTS BOEING OVER TRADE SPAT: As he highlighted the defence industry as a driver of economic growth, Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan also used a major speech Wednesday to blast American firm Boeing for picking a trade spat with Bombardier. Sajjan said Canada is disappointed by the "unfounded" action by one of its major partners in the defence industry and he delivered that message to hundreds at a breakfast speech at a major trade show for military contractors in Ottawa. Boeing has petitioned the U.S. Commerce Department and the U.S. International Trade Commission to investigate subsidies for Bombardier's CSeries aircraft that it says have allowed the Canadian company to export planes at well below cost. Sajjan said Boeing is not behaving like a "trusted partner" and the government wants the company to withdraw the complaint. The minister said the military wants to help foster a partnership with the defence industry that allows for the development of cutting-edge equipment for Canadian soldiers. He identified four areas of focus: alternative fuels, surveillance tools, remotely piloted systems and systems to counter IEDs. ——— COMMISSIONER SAYS INQUIRY WILL RETURN TO YUKON: Chief commissioner Marion Buller says the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Girls will return to Yukon, but perhaps will visit a different community next time. Buller has said previously that the inquiry will need more time and more money to complete its work, but has not said how much is needed or when the request will be made to the federal government. She says after testimony wraps up in Whitehorse this week, the commissioners will discuss how much more time is needed. As for money, Buller says the commissioners will be careful about deciding how much more to ask for because they know they are working with taxpayers' dollars. The federal government gave the commissioners a budget of about $53.9 million and asked them to complete their work by the end of 2018, but most family hearings will not take place until this fall. The commissioners heard emotional testimony on Tuesday from four families who have lost loved ones and Buller says from her perspective the day was a great success. ——— LEADERS CALL FOR RCMP TO PROBE DEATHS IN NORTHWESTERN ONTARIO: Deep distrust of police in a northwestern Ontario city has prompted area indigenous chiefs to ask for the RCMP to investigate the recent deaths of teens in the community. Three chiefs travelled to the provincial legislature Wednesday to plead for the Mounties' intervention as well as increased oversight of the police services board in Thunder Bay, Ont. They say the deaths of two teens whose bodies were pulled from local waterways earlier this month continue what they call an ongoing trend of indifference on the part of Thunder Bay police. They also noted the similar death of another indigenous person in 2015 that touched off an official probe into the force's practices around investigating the deaths or disappearances of indigenous people. Previously, the force's actions were also scrutinized at an inquest probing the deaths of seven students who had come to Thunder Bay to pursue an education beyond their remote fly-in communities. The Thunder Bay Police Services Board said it takes issue with some of the chiefs' assertions. It noted that while systemic racism is an issue plaguing indigenous communities, the problem goes well beyond relationships with police. ——— NOVA SCOTIA VOTER TURNOUT AT ALL-TIME LOW: Voter turnout in Nova Scotia slumped to an all-time low in Tuesday's provincial election, with just over half of eligible voters casting ballots. Fewer than 54 per cent of eligible voters cast ballots, a drop from the 2013 voter turnout of slightly more than 58 per cent. Premier Stephen McNeil called it "alarming," and vowed to take a "hard look" at the issue. Of the 748,633 registered electors in the province, only 400,898 cast a ballot in a race that saw McNeil win a second consecutive majority government. The urban riding of Halifax Citadel-Sable Island recorded one of the lowest voter turnouts on record, with just over 40 per cent of electors registering a vote. Cape Breton-Richmond had the biggest turnout — nearly 70 per cent. Elections Nova Scotia spokesman Andy LeBlanc says the low turnout was a disappointing departure from the strong early voting trend, in which 112,900 voters cast their ballots at advanced polls. ——— FORMER JURORS CALL FOR FEDERAL ASSISTANCE: Former jurors and New Democrat MPs are urging the federal government to create a national support system for Canadians who are called to serve as jurors. Mark Farrant says he developed post-traumatic stress disorder after serving on a jury in 2014 and wants Ottawa to take steps to ensure others don't face similar struggles. Farrant says jurors perform a significant public service, and need federal help to address the emotional toll the task can exact on their lives and families. NDP House leader Murray Rankin says his party is calling for a national standard of support for Canadians serving on juries. He says serving as a juror can be very stressful and traumatizing, and the federal government should stand behind Canadians who carry out their public duties. Farrant says he met this week in Ottawa with MPs including Bill Blair, the parliamentary secretary to Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould, and officials from the Justice Department. ——— EAST COAST TOWN WANTS TO GIVE AWAY ARMOURED VEHICLE: If you're in the market for a large, tank-like vehicle, the Nova Scotia town of New Glasgow has a deal for you. The town's police chief says he wants to give away the department's Cougar light-armoured vehicle, which was a gift from the former local MP, Peter MacKay, when he was defence minister. The 10-tonne vehicle was first used by the Canadian military in the 1970s, but their fleet of Cougars has since been retired, and some were given to other militaries and police forces. New Glasgow officials have been trying to off-load the six-wheeled machine for the past six months, admitting it had rarely been used since it arrived four years ago. It was supposed to be used by the police emergency response team, but that unit was recently disbanded.  Halifax Regional Police have shown some interest in the vehicle, but talks are still underway. ———   The Canadian Press Previous Ex-nurse expected to plead guilty to 8 first-degree murder charges Next Officials warn residents to stay off of Puntledge River due to high water flows Related Articles Switching off: Parents urged to keep infants away from digital screens May 31, 2017 Air pollution results in 7,700 premature deaths in Canada each year: report May 31, 2017 Police dogs from across Canada come to Alberta for training seminar May 31, 2017 CP Regional News Man found guilty in B.C. love triangle murder handed youth sentence May 31, 2017 Collaboration between U.S. and drug companies could benefit Canada: scientist May 31, 2017 B.C. officials continue search for man who is believed to have died in mudslide May 31, 2017 An NDP minority government in B.C. may have to water down its ambitions: experts May 31, 2017 Forecast thunderstorms add to flooding concerns across southern B.C.

Sponsored content is written by Global News' without any editorial influence by the sponsor. If you'd like to learn more... - A A + Listen WASHINGTON – The multiple ways in which Donald Trump could threaten Canada-U.S. trade will be on full display this month, with a series of looming decisions and public events that hold the potential to escalate disputes. One expert counts three pathways to pain: NAFTA negotiations, punitive actions, and pressure on CEOs to shift operations to the U.S. Story continues below Gary Hufbauer says this flurry of individual actions will allow the president to point to immediate results in his “America First” agenda, giving him something to show voters in the 2018 U.S. midterm elections if NAFTA talks languish into the following year. READ MORE:  Harjit Sajjan blasts Boeing over trade spat “I think the NAFTA negotiations are going to be long, and tedious, and difficult, and not yield much fruit between now and the (midterms) in 2018,” said Hufbauer, a prominent trade analyst at Washington’s Peterson Institute. “So… these other parts of the agenda will be what Trump emphasizes when we come down to the congressional and senatorial races.” Lots is happening this month. There are at least four actions on the punitive front that Canada will be watching in June: a report on Bombardier by the Commerce Department around June 12, which could lead to duties; a decision on additional softwood-lumber duties June 23; and investigations into the national-security implications of importing steel and aluminum, which Trump says will be released in June. READ MORE: Chrystia Freeland says feds lobbying Americans hard on benefits of NAFTA There’s also a big hearing on NAFTA on June 27. The U.S. government will collect public input on what it should demand in negotiations later this year, and foreigners are invited to share submissions for the Washington event. The Canadian government is preparing for this multi-front challenge: — On Tuesday, Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan came within a whisker of threatening the U.S. company that launched the complaint against Bombardier. Ottawa has said it is reviewing plans to spend at least $5 billion on Boeing Super Hornet fighter jets. Sajjan said in a speech: “(This) is not the behaviour of a trusted partner.” — On softwood lumber, Ottawa is threatening two other trade actions. It says it might ban exports of U.S. coal from B.C., and is also studying whether the state of Oregon’s business subsidies constitute grounds for punitive action. — On steel and aluminum, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau pushed Trump during a chat in Sicily for a Canada exemption from any punitive action. The countries have relatively balanced trade in steel. In fact, Canada is by far the largest importer of U.S. steel — it took in 51 per cent of U.S. exports last year, Mexico took 39 per cent, and the next four countries took a mere one per cent each. READ MORE: Free trade, climate change on Justin Trudeau’s agenda at G7 summit in Italy The American cabinet official responsible for many of these trade actions is aware of this. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross told a congressional hearing last week: “We actually have steel surplus with Canada and Mexico, so that puts them in a little different position, as well as the fact that they are participants in NAFTA.” The Canadian government will keep taking its message on the road. Transport Minister Marc Garneau will be in Pennsylvania steel country Friday as the latest cabinet minister to travel throughout the U.S., spreading the message about US$635 billion a year in bilateral trade of goods and services, the nine million U.S. jobs related to Canadian trade, and the US$1.2 million of trade occuring every minute of the day. Garneau alone has been in Washington, D.C., Washington State, and Florida recently as the Canadian cabinet scours the continental United States is search of potential allies as these disputes arise. “It’s just making our American neighbours aware of just how much is at stake,” Garneau said in an interview. FULL COVERAGE: Softwood lumber dispute He’ll be meeting in Pittsburgh with two Republican congressman and with the head of the United Steelworkers union — Leo Gerard, who is Canadian. Gerard happened to be inside the Oval Office for the public event where Trump blasted Canadian trade in dairy, lumber, and energy. But Garneau warns against getting too exercised by this daily noise. He says he’s looking farther ahead, past June, at another big date: Aug. 16. That’s when the U.S. will have finished its NAFTA consultations and will be ready to present its demands to Canada and Mexico for the renegotiation. “The vast majority of what we’re looking at will be under NAFTA,” Garneau said in an interview. “There’s a certain amount of stuff that gets out there in the media that may not necessarily be what the United States’ final position is… “We know the art of negotiation. The real serious negotiations will be based on what is put on the table in front of us, three months from now. That’s what we will be focused on… That’s when the rubber hits the road.” Buy American is another issue on the transport minister’s mind. Domestic procurement could be a key sticking point in the NAFTA talks, and also surface as an issue in an eventual U.S. infrastructure bill. The last time it was a major irritant some Canadian companies responded by opening U.S. facilities. That’s the third kind of pressure Hufbauer expects to see, beyond sector-by-sector penalties and NAFTA harball bargaining. He says Trump already has pressed CEOs of major companies, especially in the auto sector but in others as well, with one purpose: “Threatening them to locate in the United States.” © 2017 The Canadian Press Report an error Boeing boeing bombardier dispute Bombardier Canada-US Canada-US Trade Donald Trump Justin Trudeau NAFTA Softwood lumber Editor's Picks Politics Donald Trump's Paris pull-out would put Justin Trudeau, Canadian businesses on alert, critics warn Money New GDP numbers could be bad news for Canadians with debt Canada Who wins and who loses in Ontario's decision to raise minimum wage to $15 an hour?

Airlines use guarantees from export credit agencies to secure cheaper commercial funding, but the U.S. Ex-Im has been closed to deals valued at more than $10 million since July 2015 as some lawmakers blocked the appointment of a new board. During the height of the financial crisis, export-credit agencies supported as much as 30% of commercial aircraft deliveries. The total has fallen to less than 5% as Ex-Im remained on the sidelines and agencies in the U.K., Germany and France that back Airbus SE deals also halted new business because of a probe into alleged corruption. While President Donald Trump has in recent weeks reversed his prior opposition to the Ex-Im, sales supported by overseas agencies would provide additional options for Boeing customers that find it tough to secure commercial finance. The new pact with Italy's Sace SpA is the first between Boeing and an overseas export credit agency and provides a template for the company to secure similar deals with other countries that supply large parts of its jetliners, said Jon Byron, an aviation financier at Apple Bank. Sace's involvement reflects the role of Italian companies such as Leonardo SpA in providing parts for Boeing jets, which Sace said supported 12,000 jobs in the country. It sealed its first deal this month with guarantees for three 737-800 planes acquired by Turkey-based SunExpress. Boeing's best-selling jet has a list price of $98 million, though airlines typically secure large discounts. U.K. Export Finance, Britain's state-owned export agency that has long backed sales of Boeing jets powered by Rolls-Royce Holdings PLC engines, is expanding its offerings. Other countries with large Boeing suppliers -- such as Japan and South Korea -- are expected to follow the path taken by Italy, said bankers. Boeing declined to comment on any pending agreements with other agencies but said the Sace deal provided an alternative for some customers, even as the company continues to push for Ex-Im to be reopened for large deals. Airlines have traditionally been by far the largest user of Ex-Im guarantees and Boeing has led the lobbying battle to keep the bank open, claiming it is at a competitive disadvantage to Airbus without access to comparable U.S. financing. The aerospace giant has resorted to renting some jets to customers unable to secure commercial funding. Aerospace accounted for almost half of Ex-Im's business in fiscal 2015 and had been moving beyond commercial jetliners to back sales of satellites, rocket launches, business jets and helicopters, as well as aircraft repairs and other aviation services.

This year, we plan to take anything between 6-8 aircraft from the open lease market and induct in the fleet, primarily B 737NGs," Jet Airways Chief Financial Officer and acting CEO, Amit Agarwal said during a post- earnings analysts call here. "We have already added one (such) aircraft into the fleet," he added. Je Airways had, in 2015, announced an order for 75 Boeing 737 Max aircraft as a part of its fleet replacement strategy. Delivery of these planes is to commence from next year. Jet Airways has reported nearly 95 per cent fall in consolidated net profit at Rs 23 crore in the three months ended March 2017 as higher fuel prices and lower fares took a toll on its bottomline. In fact, if the other incomes of Rs 310.45 crore, which include income from transfer of frequent flyer programme, sale and leaseback income and real estate income are removed, then its a net loss of Rs 287 crore. The airline plans to reduce debt by USD 200 million by this fiscal, Agarwal said, adding it was cut by Rs 1,900 crore in the last fiscal. "The company has continued to focus on reducing debt despite challenging situation in the market place. The company has been able to reduce its net debt by Rs 468 crore in Q4FY17 and over all by Rs 1,900 crore during the fiscal 2016-17," the official said. According to Jet Airways, its net debt on balancesheet stood at Rs 9035 crore or USD 1.4 billion at the end of March this year. Agarwal also said that the airline is evaluating its participation in the central Government's regional connectivity scheme, UDAN. "In the first round we had not bid for the RCS routes. In the second round, we will continue to evaluate whether it makes sense for us, especially when we are a network carrier," he said adding the airline has to asses as to see how it benefit its network.

Adravida Barata. JAKARTA: A Indonesian passenger plane carrying 146 people skidded off the runway as it landed in the eastern Papua region Wednesday, an official said, the latest mishap to hit the country’s aviation sector. No one was hurt after the Boeing aircraft operated by domestic carrier Sriwijaya Air overshot the wet runway at the airport in Manokwari city, said transport ministry spokesman J. Adravida Barata. TV footage showed people being evacuated from the plane, as it rested on its belly on grass next to the runway. The airport will be closed for several hours so that the plane can be removed, Barata added. It is just the latest of many accidents for Indonesia’s air transport sector. In February, a Sriwijaya plane carrying 192 people from China to Bali was forced to turn back after the crew realised one of its doors was not properly closed. In the same month, a passenger plane operated by Indonesian flag carrier Garuda skidded off the runway as it landed at the airport serving the city of Yogyakarta in heavy rain. The aviation sector has been booming in recent years as a growing middle class increasingly use planes to get around the vast archipelago, but critics say safety standards have not kept pace with the expansion.

The news comes about seven weeks after the fateful incident in which officers dragged a passenger off a plane when he refused to give up his seat for a United employee. The FAA alleged that back in June 2014, United mechanics replaced a fuel pump pressure switch on the Boeing aircraft but failed to perform a required inspection before returning the aircraft to service. A United spokesman said, “The safety of our customers and employees is our top priority. We immediately took action after identifying the issue and are working closely with the FAA in their review.” United has faced public backlash in the wake of April’s incident, which was followed by more public relations fiascos including the death of a large rabbit on a United flight. Last week, a gay dad said he planned to sue the airline after a flight attendant allegedly accused him of molesting his son. Reuters contributed to this report.

Sent off to the store room for a tin of tartan paint. Told to find a new bubble for the spirit level, up on the shelf beside the glass hammers. Today’s modern apprenticeships, run by Skills Development Scotland, are not like that. Every year, 25,000 school leavers start four-year traineeships, earning while learning on the job. They are in every part of the economy, from health and finance to building and IT. At the end, young people have a qualification. There are four levels, with the top one equivalent to a degree. And they have no student debt around their necks. A wide range of career paths will be on show at The Scottish Apprenticeship Shows in Glasgow, Edinburgh and Aberdeen this autumn. Modern apprenticeships are also a great way for young women to get into technical professions. We met three mould-breakers excelling in male-dominated jobs. Read More Scots Muslim convert forced to flee country after sick social media rant on Manchester bombing causes backlash Anna Manson Anna Manson will soon complete her HND in aeronautical engineering (Photo: Daily Record) Anna finished her apprenticeship – “got her time out” – last year. Like the five other young people who started with her at Spirit in Monkton in 2012, she’s been kept on. She has two more exams to get her HND in aeronautical engineering. Anna spent the first year of her apprenticeship Ayr College, learning the basics of aircraft engineering and practical skills such as hand drilling. For the next three years, she spent six months working on each of the models the Ayrshire factory builds. “I now have experience of Airbus and Boeing, the two biggest manufacturers, so I can work anywhere in the world,” she said. Anna’s first day at the vast plant was quite intimidating. She explained: “The interview and testing was in the office, but the factory is huge. “There’s so much going on, it’s so busy, it’s really noisy as well. It’s not like anything at school.” But Anna settled in fine, and is now helping two female friends in engineering apprenticeships adjust to working in male environments – not that she finds it hard. She said: “Most of the time it’s fine, I don’t notice any difference at all. But occasionally when it’s all football chat I start to tune out.” One niggle is the uniform. The boiler suits don’t fit her so she wears a paper one over combat trousers and a polo shirt – plus gloves, boots and ear defenders. “It’s a really great look,” she grinned. “But if you’re too hung up on how you look, it’s probably not the right job for you.” Bethany Welsh Bethany Welsh wants to be a site engineer (Photo: Daily Record) Architecture and design have been Bethany Welsh’s obsessions since first-year at school. The classroom was never her favourite place but she loved technical subjects. She recalled: “I was always outdoors, doing stuff. I didn’t not like going to school, but when the last bell rang it was the best time of my day. “I wanted to be out on the site designing, seeing projects being built, being part of that process.” A graduate-level apprenticeship with Balfour Beatty in the north of Scotland ticked all the boxes. Bethany has worked on major infrastructure projects such as the Inveramsay Bridge outside Inverurie. As a contractor for the RAF, she has been on bases around the north of Scotland, as well as working on the nuclear plant at Caithness. She has also joined smaller projects including a local authority flood protection scheme. And she has run her own concrete-pouring operation – not an achievement on many 20-year-olds’ CVs. There is classroom time involved, but it’s nothing like school. Bethany explained: “It’s much more interesting now. It’s something you want to learn because you’ve got the job and you can relate it to what you’re doing every day.” Now in her fourth year with Balfour Beatty, Bethany is convinced she made the right career move. She said: “I will come out with the same qualification as someone who has been to university, but with years and years of experience, which is ultimately what employers are looking for. “Once I have qualified I want to be a site engineer. “I’ve thought about going into the design side of civil engineering, maybe when I’m older. But that site experience – that’s with me for life. I will remember that more than reading a book.” Read More 18 women on hen do in tears after being kicked off plane for wearing 'offensive' t-shirts Kelsey Pexton Kelsey Pexton When Kelsey first did work experience with Arnold Clark, she had no interest in cars. She hadn’t even started driving lessons. But she got on so well that they invited her back and eventually offered her an apprenticeship. She had planned to go to university to study product engineering but after trying all the different roles in the firm’s body shop, she changed gear. “I did parts, mechanics, reception and spray-painting,” she recalled. “But I’m quite an artsy, designy person and I liked painting, so that drew me towards that side of the job.” Kelsey is the only woman in the body shop. But she insisted: “It’s not as bad as everyone thinks.” Until, that is, her colleagues start on their favourite subject. “They talk about football all the time,” she said. “I have tried, but I don’t really have any interest in football whatsoever. “I put my earphones in and get Netflix on so I don’t have to listen to it.” She is also the only female in her block release class of 15 at West College Scotland in Clydebank. “It was a bit challenging when we started. The boys were saying, ‘Oh, we have a girl in our class, better watch what we’re saying.’ Now they’re fine.” People meeting five-foot Kelsey for the first time often she assumes she works in a traditionally “ladylike” job. She soon puts them right. “They can’t believe such a small petite person can do a big job like spray-painting cars. They think I work in retail until I tell them no no no, I work for Arnold Clark. “My boyfriend is still coming to terms with it. He says I have a more masculine job than he does. He has to deal with it. I’m not changing my job any time soon.” Read More Top news stories today Racist yob tracked down Council flat turned into bomb factory Scot plunge victim in intensive care Boost for Gers bid to bring in Pena Like us on Facebook Follow us on Twitter Daily Newsletter Follow @Daily_Record Subscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribe More On Universities and Colleges Glasgow Edinburgh Aberdeen Education Tartan Schools News all Most Read Most Recent RacismRacist yob who filmed himself in Celtic pub chanting vile abuse about Scott Sinclair is tracked down The Record can today unmask Robbie Anderson as the brainless hooligan who filmed himself branding the Hoops hero a “f****n n****r”.

Thursday, June 1, 2017 Oman Observer Home Top stories Local World Region Asia India Europe America Business Oman Motor Technology Market Sports Oman Sport Football Cricket Golf Tennis Ramadhan Books Entertainment Lifestyle People Spotlight Arts Travel Magazines Weekend National Day 45 Mazoon Duqm The Vision Oman Logistics Aqar Oman Opal Magazine More Main Analysis My Voice Blogs Weekend Health Environment Technology Culture Saturday Editor's choice Gourmet Cartoon Ask your doctor WILDLIFE Auto Videos Archive 2016 2015 E PAPER World  US successfully tests ICBM defence system for first time 31/05/2017 Oman Observer WASHINGTON/VANDENBERG AIR FORCE BASE: The US military on Tuesday cheered a successful, first-ever missile defence test involving a simulated attack by an intercontinental ballistic missile, in a major milestone for a programme meant to defend against a mounting North Korean threat. The US military fired an ICBM-type missile from the Kwajalein Atoll in the Marshall Islands towards the waters just south of Alaska. It then fired a missile to intercept it from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. Experts compare the job to hitting a bullet with another bullet and note the complexity is magnified by the enormous distances involved. The Missile Defence Agency said it was the first live-fire test against a simulated ICBM for the Ground-based Midcourse Defence (GMD), managed by Boeing Co, and hailed it as an “incredible accomplishment.” “This system is vitally important to the defence of our homeland, and this test demonstrates that we have a capable, credible deterrent against a very real threat,” Vice Admiral Jim Syring, director of the agency, said in a statement. A successful test was by no means guaranteed and the Pentagon sought to manage expectations earlier in the day, noting that the United States had multiple ways to try to shoot down a missile from North Korea. “This is one element of a broader missile defence strategy that we can use to employ against potential threats,” Pentagon spokesman Captain Jeff Davis told reporters. Prior to Tuesday’s launch, the GMD system had successfully hit its target in only nine of 17 tests since 1999. The last test was in 2014. North Korea has dramatically ramped up missile tests over the past year in its effort to develop an ICBM that can strike the US mainland. The continental United States is around 9,000 km from North Korea. ICBMs have a minimum range of about 5,500 km, but some are designed to travel 10,000 km or farther. Riki Ellison, founder of the Missile Defence Advocacy Alliance, described the test as “vital” prior to launch. “We are replicating our ability to defend the United States of America from North Korea, today,” Ellison said. Failure could have deepened concern about a programme that according to one estimate has so far cost more than $40 billion. Its success could translate into calls by Congress to speed development. — Reuters ← Previous People smugglers make $35 bn a year on migrant crisis, says IOM head Trump plans to pull US out of climate deal: Source Next → You May Also Like Australia battles 50 fires in heat wave 11/02/2017 Oman Observer Comments Off on Australia battles 50 fires in heat wave 48 Yemeni soldiers dead in IS-claimed bombing 18/12/2016 Oman Observer Comments Off on 48 Yemeni soldiers dead in IS-claimed bombing As summer heat looms, post-IS Mosul faces water crisis 12/05/2017 Oman Observer Comments Off on As summer heat looms, post-IS Mosul faces water crisis Latest News Muscat 7th most important city in Arab world 31/05/2017 Oman Observer Comments Off on Muscat 7th most important city in Arab world TEN arrested for making fraud calls 31/05/2017 Oman Observer Comments Off on TEN arrested for making fraud calls Feast after fast risk to health 31/05/2017 Kabeer Yousuf Comments Off on Feast after fast risk to health Two poachers arrested in Qurayat 31/05/2017 Oman Observer Comments Off on Two poachers arrested in Qurayat Facebook Twitter Instagram Load More...

X Close Regional Home > News > Regional < Back to SMG 45 Thursday, 1 June 2017 Plane overshoots runway in Indonesia Jakarta: An Indonesian passenger plane carrying 146 people skidded off the runway as it landed in the eastern Papua region, an official said, the latest mishap to hit the country’s aviation sector. No one was hurt after the Boeing aircraft operated by domestic carrier Sriwijaya Air overshot the wet runway at the airport in Manokwari city, said transport ministry spokesman J. Adravida Barata. TV footage showed people being evacuated from the plane, as it rested on its belly on grass next to the runway. The airport will be closed for several hours so that the plane can be removed, Barata added.

Harjit Sajjan said Boeing's action against Bombardier is "unfounded" and not the behavior of a "trusted partner." He said buying the Super Hornet fighter jets "requires a trusted industry partner." Sajjan urged Boeing to withdraw the complaint in a speech. Canada's foreign minister has also threatened to block the order. "Our government - and I stress this - our government is disappointed in the action of one of our leading industry partners," he said. Chicago-based Boeing's trade complaint prompted a U.S. Commerce Department anti-dumping investigation that could result in duties being imposed on Bombardier's new larger CSeries passenger aircraft. Boeing insists the plane receives Canadian government subsidies that give it an advantage internationally. Canada's threat is coming amid increasing trade disputes with the U.S. Scott Day, a spokesman for Boeing, noted that Sajjan also recognized Boeing as a strong partner in the past and for the future. Day defended the company's trade action. "This is a commercial matter that Boeing is seeking to address through the normal course for resolving such issues," Day said in an email. Boeing petitioned the U.S. Commerce Department and the U.S. International Trade Commission to investigate subsidies of Montreal-based Bombardier's CSeries aircraft. Boeing says Bombardier has received more than US$3 billion in government subsidies that let it engage in "predatory pricing." Brazil has also launched a formal complaint to the World Trade Organization over Canadian subsidies to Bombardier. Sao Paolo-based Embraer is a fierce rival of Bombardier's. The Quebec government invested US$1 billion in exchange for a 49.5 percent stake in the CSeries last year. Canada's federal government also recently provided a US$275 million loan to Bombardier, which struggled to win orders for its new medium-size plane. But Bombardier won a 75-plane order for the CSeries from U.S.-based Delta Air Lines in 2016. Bombardier said its planes never competed with Boeing in the sale to Delta. The Canadian government said late last year it would enter into discussions on buying 18 Super Hornet jet fighters from Boeing on an interim basis and hold an open competition to buy more planes over the next five years. Canada remains part of Lockheed Martin's F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program. Sajjan said he would have more to say about the issue next week.

The aircraft is indeed huge. It's wingspan is 385 feet, or nearly double that of a Boeing (ba) 787 Dreamliner. Its length is 238 feet, 12 feet longer than the Dreamliner, with a tail that is 50-feet tall, or nearly the height of a five-story building. Here is a picture of the rollout. The goal is for Stratolaunch to carry satellites close to space and then launch them before returning to Earth. Get Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter. To get to this point, technicians had to take down the scaffolding that supported the craft's construction and make sure the Stratolaunch's 28 wheels could support its 500,000-lb. weight. It was designed to handle a maximum takeoff weight, including cargo, of 1.3 million lbs., according to Stratolaunch CEO Jean Floyd. Stratolaunch Systems  The next steps? Ground and flight testing will take place at the Mojave Air and Space Port over the coming months, Floyd wrote.

With Caterpillar’s announcement Tuesday that its top executives will be moving from Peoria, Illinois, to Chicago, that trend appears to be continuing (although it’s not clear yet whether that HQ will be in downtown Chicago or the suburbs). But Caterpillar’s new headquarters isn’t going to be very big: Only about 300 people will work there, compared with 12,000 in and around Peoria. This small-headquarters approach is kind of a thing, especially in Chicago. As Claire Bushey of Crain’s Chicago Business wrote in a big report last year on “The Incredible Shrinking HQ”: “These headquarters represent the pinnacle of the corporate pyramid, snapped off and relocated, free of jobs tied to operations and often mid-level HQ functions such as payroll, human resources or purchasing. To be sure, migrating headquarters offer benefits to the city: They boost demand for business services, their executives join the philanthropic scene and, of course, they confer bragging rights. But in terms of jobs, the farther a company travels to set up shop in Chicago, the fewer people come with it.” Or as the Manhattan Institute’s Aaron Renn, an urban thinker with a tendency to notice things before other people do, observed in 2008: “The ‘headquarters’ is actually splitting into two: an executive headquarters and an operational headquarters.” “The people in ‘executive headquarters’ are precisely those who most need proximity to the global city service providers that increasingly form a key part of company operations. Also, recruiting executive talent and proximity to airports play a role. And when companies want to think in a totally global manner, they can want to have their main office physically separate from any particular operating location.” This phenomenon is real. It’s especially apparent in Chicago, where Boeing, Archer-Daniels-Midland, Conagra Brands, General Electric’s transportation and health-care divisions and now Caterpillar have all chosen to locate new headquarters that hold significantly fewer people than their old HQs elsewhere. But is this the new normal? Is it really true that, as Harvard Business School professor David Collis put it in Bushey’s article, “The notion of the corporate headquarters in the ‘Mad Men’ world when there were hundreds or thousands of people in a building with the company logo . . . those days are gone.” Actually, when I go down a list of the largest US corporations by market capitalisation, they almost all have headquarters with hundreds or thousands of people in a building – or campus of buildings – with the company logo. The only exceptions among the top 25 that I’m aware of are Berkshire Hathaway, with its 25-person office in Kiewit Plaza in Omaha, Nebraska, and General Electric, which has a couple hundred people camped out in a Boston office building waiting for its new three-building headquarters complex to be completed nearby. Berkshire has had a bare-bones headquarters from the beginning, and it’s not in Omaha for the “global city service providers” or the airport. The city just happened to be where Warren Buffett is from, and he happened to see his role as an asset allocator rather than as manager of the many businesses that Berkshire owns. GE is another collection of disparate businesses where a bit more managing is done from the HQ but the executive headquarters and the operational ones have been separate for a long time. When the company settles into its new Boston headquarters, employment will reportedly be about the same – 800 people – as in the old HQ in Fairfield, Connecticut, albeit with a different mix of jobs. Meanwhile, the tech companies that currently dominate the top of the market cap list (Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon.com and Facebook occupy five of the top six spots; Berkshire is the only interloper) are all run out of large office complexes, most in the suburbs, that contain thousands of workers. It’s apparently still deemed crucial for top executives to be near the engineers and others who make the companies go. Also, all these companies grew up in or near big cities with pretty good airports – unlike some older manufacturers that happened to locate a century ago in small cities that never grew big. So maybe the “executive headquarters” is something for a certain kind of corporation – a conglomerate, a manufacturer of heavy equipment, a mature company in retrenchment mode. The bare-bones headquarters is a characteristic of companies controlled by private equity firms, which are often looking to cut costs and bring focus. I think it was also relatively common back in the late 1800s and early 1900s, when New York-based financiers controlled vast operations elsewhere. Maybe it really is on the rise now, and more big companies will follow. But it does seem like the most exciting, dynamic companies are the ones where the top executives aren’t off in a city apart from everybody else. – Bloomberg Justin Fox is a Bloomberg View columnist.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 1 June 2017 by Maciej Heyman Airline Stock Roundup: British Airways’ IT Glitch, Ryanair’s FY17 Results, Laptop Ban Update &amp; More Shutterstock photo The past week saw U.K.-based carrier British Airways suffering a major IT system failure that resulted in the cancellation of flights and untold miseries to passengers. Also, updates (albeit of a mixed nature) on the laptop ban extension on U.S. flights grabbed headlines. Delta Air Lines DAL also made news in the past week, that was a day short of trading owing to the Memorial Day holiday on May 29, as it aims to ease U.S.-Mexico air travel through its association with Aeromexico. On the earnings front, European low-cost carrier Ryanair Holdings plc RYAAY reported modest results in fiscal 2017 (ended Mar 31, 2017) and issued a cautious outlook for fiscal 2018. Transportation – Airline Industry 5YR % Return Transportation – Airline Industry 5YR % Return (Read the last Airline Stock Roundup here ). Recap of the Past Week’s Most Important Stories 1. Delta strengthened its long-standing partnership with Mexico’s largest airline Grupo Aeromexico by implementing a joint cooperation agreement (JCA) to operate flights connecting the U.S. and Mexico. As part of the JCA, the carriers recently stated their intention to launch five flights targeting new markets. Apart from adding new routes, the carriers aim to increase the frequency of flights and use more modern aircrafts in four and two markets, respectively. The measures aimed at facilitating travel between the nations (likely to be implemented as early as this fall) are subject to government clearance. (Read more: Delta Air Lines & Aeromexico Aim to Ease US-Mexico Travel ). 2. Earlier this week, it was reported that the U.S. Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly had said in an interview that passengers may be banned from carrying laptops in all flights to/from the U.S. However, a Politico report on May 30 stated that the US had decided against banning laptops from the cabins of US bound planes from Europe as of now. 3. Ryanair Holdings reported financial and operating numbers with net profit for fiscal 2017 up 6% year over year at €1,316 million despite a 13% decline in average airfares. The top line expanded 2% to €6,648 million on the back of a 13% rise in traffic to 120 million. Lower costs aided the bottom line. Moreover, load factor increased 100 basis points to 94%. The customer friendly „Always Getting Better (AGB)” program aided results. The carrier issued a „cautious” outlook for fiscal 2018 following anticipation of negative Brexit-related developments and repetition of terror attacks. Average fares are expected to decline in the band of 5-7% in fiscal 2018. Net profit for fiscal 2018 is expected in the band of €1.4-€1.45 billion, up approximately 8%. The low-cost carrier expects ancillary sales to account for 30% of the top line by Mar 2020. The company is looking to expedite the growth of its fleet by including more Boeing jets. Ryanair sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here . 4. Passengers at British Airways had to undergo undue harassments as the largest carrier in the U.K. (in terms of on fleet size) encountered a major IT system failure, resulting in cancellation of multiple flights. The global disruption was apparently caused by ” an exceptional power surge, ” which caused the IT system to collapse resulting in the catastrophe. Whatever be the reason, the meltdown affected travel plans of thousands of passengers with chaos at Heathrow and Gatwick airports. The airline, which is investigating the incident, said that it will compensate the concerned passengers. However, costs on that front may exceed the £100 million mark. 5. According to a Bloomberg report , American Airlines Group AAL intends to curtail the legroom for passengers on its newest Boeing 737 planes. By trimming the space between rows more seats/passengers can be accommodated, thereby allowing it to sell more low-priced tickets. It is widely believed that the move is aimed at countering the threat posed by low-cost carriers like Spirit Airlines SAVE and JetBlue Airways Corp. JBLU .

Li made the call during his talks with German Chancellor Angela Merkel in Berlin. He is on an official visit to Germany for an annual meeting between the two heads of government, a mechanism that has been in place since 2004. The twin-engine C919 made a maiden flight on May 5 in Shanghai with five crew members on board but no passengers. The success makes China the fourth jumbo jet producer after the United States, Western Europe and Russia. With a standard range of 4,075 km, the narrow-body jet is comparable with updated Airbus 320 and Boeing's new generation 737 planes, signaling the country's entry into the global aviation market. China has taken pride in developing the homegrown jumbo jet, regarding it as a symbol of national strength. In 2007, the State Council approved plans to develop a large passenger jet. In November 2015, the first C919 jet rolled off the assembly line. More than 200,000 technicians worked on the project. A total of 23 foreign and domestic customers, including China's national carrier Air China, had placed orders for 570 aircraft as of May 5, according to COMAC, the manufacturer. COMAC has to seek airworthiness certificates from domestic and foreign aviation safety regulators before making its first deliveries slated for around 2019. Airworthiness is the measure of an aircraft's suitability for safe flight. | PRINT | RSS SINA English is the English-language destination for news and information about China.

And when someone speaks, listen. It could save a life. Those were the points that Medal of Honor recipient Florent Groberg drove home when he delivered the keynote address at the Shaka Franklin Foundation’s 27th Love Our Children Luncheon. The Shaka Franklin Foundation is a nonprofit organization dedicated to suicide intervention and prevention. Like Groberg, founder Les Franklin, who lost two sons to suicide, knows just how important it is to lend an ear and get people the help they need before they take their own life. On Aug. 8, 2012, Groberg, who is now Boeing’s director of veteran outreach, was serving as a personal security detachment commander for Task Force Mountain Warrior in Kunar Province, Afghanistan, responsible for the safety of 28 coalition and Afghan National Army personnel as they traveled on foot to the provincial governor’s compound.

Instinctively, Groberg knew it was a suicide bomber so he sprinted toward the man and wrestled him to the ground. The bomb he was carrying detonated, killing four members of Groberg’s party. Groberg himself suffered life-threatening injuries and underwent 33 surgeries in the 36 months he spent recovering at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center. He admitted that thoughts of suicide crossed his mind as he lay in that hospital bed. A high school track star whose dreams of competing in the Olympics were dashed after losing half of his calf muscle and sustaining a mild traumatic brain injury in the incident, Groberg advised those attending the event held at the Hyatt Regency Tech Center to not lose hope, no matter the situation. “Life is precious,” he said. “Find the strength to live and open up to others to let them in to help. Share your story and trust loved ones and those who care.” Groberg followed his own advice, and in November 2015, then-President Barack Obama presented him with the Medal of Honor, the nation’s highest military honor for valor in combat. The luncheon, which raised $165,000, also included the presentation of several scholarships. Raul Cardenas, vice chancellor of student affairs at the University of Colorado Denver, accepted a check for $25,000 to add to the Shaka Franklin Foundation for Youth  Scholarship Fund; Dan Ackeren accepted a $15,000 check for the Shaka Franklin Foundation for Youth Athletic Scholarship at the University of Denver; and military veteran Doug Hernandez was given a $2,500 scholarship to help him complete his senior year at CU Denver, after which he will enroll in medical school. Lida Citroen, an international branding specialist, introduced Groberg to an audience that included Matt Vogl, (cq) director of the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus National Behavioral Innovation Center; Karic (cq) Roberts, who served 15 years in the U.S. Army as a combat engineer; and Roger Fink, president of FinkInk and the event’s master of ceremonies.

Last week, MBS, as he’s known in Saudi Arabia, was meeting with President Donald Trump in Riyadh. Pavel Golovkin AP Saudi Deputy Crown Prince and Defense Minister Mohammad bin Salman meets with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow on Tuesday, May 30, 2017. Last week, MBS, as he’s known in Saudi Arabia, was meeting with President Donald Trump in Riyadh. Pavel Golovkin AP Politics & Government May 31, 2017 4:55 PM Trump expects Saudi Arabia to invest billions of dollars in the U.S. By Anita Kumar akumar@mcclatchydc.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story RIYADH, SAUDI ARABIA Saudi Arabia’s young deputy crown prince had a message for America’s new president at their first meeting in March: The kingdom wanted to invest billions of dollars in U.S. companies, creating thousands of jobs. It was just what Donald Trump, the U.S.’s first billionaire president, wanted to hear after winning the White House, in part on his background as a businessman and his pledge to make some deals, according to people familiar with the meeting who are not authorized to speak publicly about it. While Trump repeatedly clashed with the democratically elected leaders of U.S. allies in Europe on his first overseas trip as president, he got along famously with his counterparts in the Middle East, especially in Saudi Arabia, where they treated him like royalty. Here’s one big reason why: Mohammad bin Salman, the influential 31-year-old prince who is helping to run the nation alongside his father, King Salman. Among the deputy crown prince’s plans is the sell-off of a piece of state-owned oil giant Aramco, with the proceeds to be invested in companies at home and abroad, including the United States. Saudi Deputy Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman discusses US-Saudi strategic partnership & global security with @POTUS Trump #RiyadhSummit pic.twitter.com/yA4ItTwaIy— RiyadhSummit (@riyadhsummit) May 20, 2017 “It helps if you have a leader in the White House and the administration receptive to the situation in Saudi Arabia and willing to continue strengthening the ties,” said well-known Saudi economist Ihsan Buhulaiga. “That, of course, is a great help. But also this country thinks highly of the United States and the president of the United States.” The U.S. and Saudi Arabia struck a series of deals totaling more than $350 billion over 10 years during the president’s recent two-day visit to Riyadh, which Trump hopes is the first step toward an even bigger investment when Aramco stock is offered to the public. The two countries signed agreements – including some prospective ones – involving a variety of industries, such as technology, medical equipment, chemicals and real estate, with $110 billion on defense alone. Some of the companies involved are Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Blackstone Raytheon, General Dynamics, Exxon Mobil, General Electric and Dow, according to a White House document. But there’s no guarantee any of the agreements will create jobs in the U.S. or, in some cases, that they will happen at all. In Riyadh, many Saudis worry that the kingdom will give too much money to the United States after Trump repeatedly said before he was president that Saudi Arabia failed to pay its fair share for U.S. defense assistance. The issue dominated social media during the president’s visit, with images like one where Trump slips his hand into King Salman’s pocket to take money as he hugs him. If Saudi Arabia, which has been making one billion dollars a day from oil, wants our help and protection, they must pay dearly! NO FREEBIES.— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 26, 2015 I just want to know how much is Saudi Arabia and others who we are helping willing to pay for our saving from total extinction. Pay up now!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 11, 2014 “In a state where we are suffering from our economy, people are worried about what we are going to pay,” said Aziza al Yousef, 60, a human rights activist, during an interview at her home in Riyadh. “What is he going to make us pay for? Are we getting anything from these deals or not? Is he really doing anything for us or just come here for us to pay a penalty?” But John Sfakianakis, director of economics at the Gulf Research Center in Riyadh and former adviser to the Saudi Arabian government, said there were “huge opportunities” for U.S. companies and Saudi Arabia. “For decades, Saudi private investors have invested in U.S. businesses and real estate,” Sfakianakis said. “Saudi has helped through these investments and buying of U.S. products keep thousands of jobs in America.” President Donald Trump’s nine-day maiden foreign trip began in Riyadh and included stops in Israel, the Vatican, Brussels and Sicily. Prince Mohammad, who serves as chairman of the Council for Economic and Development Affairs and as defense minister, introduced a plan that calls for selling a stake of less than 5 percent of the state-owned oil company, potentially creating the world’s biggest publicly traded firm. The son of King Salman and his third wife, known in Saudi Arabia simply as MBS, quickly became an aide to his father. His influence had already ballooned as his father rose in the government and made young MBS his private adviser. At his visit to the White House in March, Prince Mohammad told Trump and his son-in-law and top adviser, Jared Kushner, about his idea, part of Saudi Vision 2030, which is well known and frequently mentioned in the capital city. Signs touting Saudi Vision 2030 are all over Riyadh, including the airport. “The two countries highlighted that expanded economic cooperation could create as many as 1 million direct American jobs within the next four years, millions of indirect American jobs, as well as jobs in Saudi Arabia,” according to a White House readout of the March visit. So far, there’s no evidence that Saudi Arabia could meet such a lofty goal of 1 million jobs. The move is designed to lessen Saudi Arabia’s dependence on oil. The government has had to take a series of cost-cutting measures in recent months as the cost of oil has dropped. Prince Mohammad’s plan was inspired in part by Abu Dhabi’s national wealth fund, Mubadala Development Co., experts say. The proceeds, estimated to be as much as $2 trillion, would be injected into the Public Investment Fund, a three-decade-old fund that has until recently mostly invested in domestic opportunities. But some are worried about the consequences of a series of lawsuits filed by more than 800 families of 9/11 victims. “The PIF has provided very little information about its strategy or investments to date, which has created some concern among local businesses and technocratic elites,” said Steffen Hertog, a Middle East expert who teaches at the London School of Economics and Political Science. Saudi Arabia has invested more than $114 billion in U.S. Treasury bills. Jean-Francois Seznec, a political scientist specializing in business and finance in the Middle East who teaches at the Johns Hopkins University and Georgetown University, said Saudis were apprehensive about working with the U.S. amid the lawsuits, which could cost the kingdom a significant amount of money. The Saudi government is lobbying Trump and Congress to repeal the contentious 2016 law that allows relatives of 9/11 victims to sue the kingdom for their deaths. “There is a lot of weariness,” he said. Prince Mohammad wants the Public Investment Fund to be split between domestic and international investments. Last year, it invested $3.5 billion in the online taxi company Uber. During Trump’s visit, Blackstone, the world’s biggest private equity manager, and the Public Investment Fund announced plans to invest $40 billion in infrastructure projects, mainly in the United States.　　　 Saudi leaders said the kingdom had much to offer when it came to economic development but the issue was often overshadowed by the headline-grabbing discussion on how to combat terrorism. “Our region, unfortunately, people focus on the problems, the terrorist issue, the wars in Yemen, Iraq and Syria, but there are issues that have been underreported – that’s the innovation and the willingness of our people to invest in their own future –that doesn’t really get that much attention,” said a Saudi official with knowledge of the situation who is not authorized to speak publicly.

The US military fired an ICBM-type missile from the Kwajalein Atoll in the Marshall Islands toward the waters just south of Alaska. It then fired a missile to intercept it from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. Experts compare the job to hitting a bullet with another bullet and note the complexity is magnified by the enormous distances involved. The Missile Defense Agency said it was the first live-fire test against a simulated ICBM for the Ground-based Midcourse Defense (GMD), managed by Boeing Co, and hailed it as an “incredible accomplishment.” “This system is vitally important to the defense of our homeland, and this test demonstrates that we have a capable, credible deterrent against a very real threat,” Vice Admiral Jim Syring, director of the agency, said in a statement. A successful test was by no means guaranteed and the Pentagon sought to manage expectations earlier in the day, noting that the United States had multiple ways to try to shoot down a missile from North Korea. “This is one element of a broader missile defense strategy that we can use to employ against potential threats,” Pentagon spokesman Captain Jeff Davis told reporters. Prior to Tuesday’s launch, the GMD system had successfully hit its target in only nine of 17 tests since 1999. The last test was in 2014. North Korea has dramatically ramped up missile tests over the past year in its effort to develop an ICBM that can strike the US mainland. The continental United States is around 9,000 km from North Korea. ICBMs have a minimum range of about 5,500 km, but some are designed to travel 10,000 km or farther. Riki Ellison, founder of the Missile Defense Advocacy Alliance, described the test as “vital” prior to launch. “We are replicating our ability to defend the United States of America from North Korea, today,” Ellison said. Failure could have deepened concern about a program that according to one estimate has so far cost more than $40 billion. Its success could translate into calls by Congress to speed development. In the fiscal year 2018 budget proposal sent to Congress last week, the Pentagon requested $7.9 billion for the Missile Defense Agency, including about $1.5 billion for the GMD program. A 2016 assessment released by the Pentagon’s weapons testing office in January said that US ground-based interceptors meant to knock out any incoming ICBM still had low reliability, giving the system a limited capability of shielding the United States. — Reuters SHARE Facebook Twitter tweet Previous articleGains in certain sectors send Saudi stocks higher Next articleAramco in joint venture with 3 other firms for building of maritime yard in Ras Al-Khair Mohammed Ahmed Al Aidroos RELATED ARTICLESMORE FROM AUTHOR Kingdom School killer is a disgruntled former employee Kingdom slams deadly Kabul, Baghdad blasts OPEC, non-OPEC committed to inventory cut NO COMMENTS LEAVE A REPLY Cancel reply June 2017 S M T W T F S « May       1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30   STAY CONNECTED 1,641,188FansLike 44,175FollowersFollow Ads Recent Posts Kingdom School killer is a disgruntled former employee June 1, 2017 Kingdom slams deadly Kabul, Baghdad blasts June 1, 2017 OPEC, non-OPEC committed to inventory cut June 1, 2017 Makkah tunnels ready for visitors June 1, 2017 Trump’s Kingdom visit a historic turning point: Spicer June 1, 2017 Archives June 2017 May 2017 April 2017 March 2017 February 2017 January 2017 December 2016 November 2016 October 2016 September 2016 August 2016 July 2016 June 2016 May 2016 April 2016 March 2016 February 2016 January 2016 December 2015 November 2015 October 2015 September 2015 August 2015 July 2015 © Saudi Gazette 2015 All rights reserved.

Pavel Golovkin AP Politics & Government May 31, 2017 4:55 PM Trump expects Saudi Arabia to invest billions of dollars in the U.S. By Anita Kumar akumar@mcclatchydc.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story RIYADH, SAUDI ARABIA Saudi Arabia’s young deputy crown prince had a message for America’s new president at their first meeting in March: The kingdom wanted to invest billions of dollars in U.S. companies, creating thousands of jobs. It was just what Donald Trump, the U.S.’s first billionaire president, wanted to hear after winning the White House, in part on his background as a businessman and his pledge to make some deals, according to people familiar with the meeting who are not authorized to speak publicly about it. While Trump repeatedly clashed with the democratically elected leaders of U.S. allies in Europe on his first overseas trip as president, he got along famously with his counterparts in the Middle East, especially in Saudi Arabia, where they treated him like royalty. Here’s one big reason why: Mohammad bin Salman, the influential 31-year-old prince who is helping to run the nation alongside his father, King Salman. Among the deputy crown prince’s plans is the sell-off of a piece of state-owned oil giant Aramco, with the proceeds to be invested in companies at home and abroad, including the United States. Saudi Deputy Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman discusses US-Saudi strategic partnership & global security with @POTUS Trump #RiyadhSummit pic.twitter.com/yA4ItTwaIy— RiyadhSummit (@riyadhsummit) May 20, 2017 “It helps if you have a leader in the White House and the administration receptive to the situation in Saudi Arabia and willing to continue strengthening the ties,” said well-known Saudi economist Ihsan Buhulaiga. “That, of course, is a great help. But also this country thinks highly of the United States and the president of the United States.” The U.S. and Saudi Arabia struck a series of deals totaling more than $350 billion over 10 years during the president’s recent two-day visit to Riyadh, which Trump hopes is the first step toward an even bigger investment when Aramco stock is offered to the public. The two countries signed agreements – including some prospective ones – involving a variety of industries, such as technology, medical equipment, chemicals and real estate, with $110 billion on defense alone. Some of the companies involved are Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Blackstone Raytheon, General Dynamics, Exxon Mobil, General Electric and Dow, according to a White House document. But there’s no guarantee any of the agreements will create jobs in the U.S. or, in some cases, that they will happen at all. In Riyadh, many Saudis worry that the kingdom will give too much money to the United States after Trump repeatedly said before he was president that Saudi Arabia failed to pay its fair share for U.S. defense assistance. The issue dominated social media during the president’s visit, with images like one where Trump slips his hand into King Salman’s pocket to take money as he hugs him. If Saudi Arabia, which has been making one billion dollars a day from oil, wants our help and protection, they must pay dearly! NO FREEBIES.— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 26, 2015 I just want to know how much is Saudi Arabia and others who we are helping willing to pay for our saving from total extinction. Pay up now!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 11, 2014 “In a state where we are suffering from our economy, people are worried about what we are going to pay,” said Aziza al Yousef, 60, a human rights activist, during an interview at her home in Riyadh. “What is he going to make us pay for? Are we getting anything from these deals or not? Is he really doing anything for us or just come here for us to pay a penalty?” But John Sfakianakis, director of economics at the Gulf Research Center in Riyadh and former adviser to the Saudi Arabian government, said there were “huge opportunities” for U.S. companies and Saudi Arabia. “For decades, Saudi private investors have invested in U.S. businesses and real estate,” Sfakianakis said. “Saudi has helped through these investments and buying of U.S. products keep thousands of jobs in America.” President Donald Trump’s nine-day maiden foreign trip began in Riyadh and included stops in Israel, the Vatican, Brussels and Sicily. Prince Mohammad, who serves as chairman of the Council for Economic and Development Affairs and as defense minister, introduced a plan that calls for selling a stake of less than 5 percent of the state-owned oil company, potentially creating the world’s biggest publicly traded firm. The son of King Salman and his third wife, known in Saudi Arabia simply as MBS, quickly became an aide to his father. His influence had already ballooned as his father rose in the government and made young MBS his private adviser. At his visit to the White House in March, Prince Mohammad told Trump and his son-in-law and top adviser, Jared Kushner, about his idea, part of Saudi Vision 2030, which is well known and frequently mentioned in the capital city. Signs touting Saudi Vision 2030 are all over Riyadh, including the airport. “The two countries highlighted that expanded economic cooperation could create as many as 1 million direct American jobs within the next four years, millions of indirect American jobs, as well as jobs in Saudi Arabia,” according to a White House readout of the March visit. So far, there’s no evidence that Saudi Arabia could meet such a lofty goal of 1 million jobs. The move is designed to lessen Saudi Arabia’s dependence on oil. The government has had to take a series of cost-cutting measures in recent months as the cost of oil has dropped. Prince Mohammad’s plan was inspired in part by Abu Dhabi’s national wealth fund, Mubadala Development Co., experts say. The proceeds, estimated to be as much as $2 trillion, would be injected into the Public Investment Fund, a three-decade-old fund that has until recently mostly invested in domestic opportunities. But some are worried about the consequences of a series of lawsuits filed by more than 800 families of 9/11 victims. “The PIF has provided very little information about its strategy or investments to date, which has created some concern among local businesses and technocratic elites,” said Steffen Hertog, a Middle East expert who teaches at the London School of Economics and Political Science. Saudi Arabia has invested more than $114 billion in U.S. Treasury bills. Jean-Francois Seznec, a political scientist specializing in business and finance in the Middle East who teaches at the Johns Hopkins University and Georgetown University, said Saudis were apprehensive about working with the U.S. amid the lawsuits, which could cost the kingdom a significant amount of money.

The American appliance giant on Wednesday filed a petition with the US International Trade Commission against Samsung Electronics and LG Electronics. The so-called safeguard petition is meant to provide help to domestic manufacturers hurt by importers selling products at excessively low prices. “This filing addresses unprecedented behaviour by two serial violators of US trade laws,” Whirlpool Chief Executive Officer Jeff Fettig said in a statement. In the filing, Whirlpool alleges Samsung and LG pursued a strategy of selling washing machines in the US at artificially low prices, then doing an “end run” around US anti-dumping laws intended to prevent such behaviour. For example, the South Korean companies moved production to Vietnam and Thailand to avoid duties being imposed by the US on machines they made in China, Whirlpool alleges. The long-simmering conflict has the potential to become a high-profile test for President Donald Trump. Trade and domestic manufacturing were signature issues in his campaign, and Fettig serves as a member of the president’s manufacturing council. If the trade commission decides in Whirlpool’s favour, it could recommend that Trump’s administration step in and slap tariffs on the competitors’ products. Whirlpool’s filing would be the latest in a series of complaints companies have filed with the ITC, a federal tribunal that rules on trade disputes. Last month, Boeing accused Bombardier of selling passenger jets in the US at “absurdly low prices,” asking the US to impose duties on the Canadian jet builder. ‘One-Way Street’ Trump has threatened to pull the US out of its free-trade agreement with South Korea, calling the 2012 deal a “one-way street” that has only benefited the Asian country. The US trade deficit with South Korea last year, at about $28bn, was the eighth-largest shortfall among US trading partners, according to Census Bureau data. Whirlpool’s dispute follows cases in which the US government has determined that the South Korean companies injured US manufacturers by selling washing machines in the country at illegal prices, Whirlpool said. “In light of their apparent inability to compete with leading global brands like LG in the US market, Whirlpool has decided to seek government restrictions to limit consumer choices,” LG said in an emailed statement. The company said that in order for Whirlpool to succeed in its petition, it would have to prove that the imported goods are found to be a significant cause of serious injury to US producers - “a high legal standard that Whirlpool cannot meet,” LG said. Representatives for Samsung didn’t have an immediate response to the filing. The disagreement with the South Korean companies dates back years, with victories on both sides. In 2011, Whirlpool alleged that its overseas rivals were receiving unfair government subsidies and selling products in the US at below-market values. In 2013, South Korea filed a World Trade Organisation dispute challenging the US Commerce Department’s calculations. It won a ruling from the WTO last year. Lagging behind The situation has hampered sales at the Benton Harbor, Michigan-based company’s washer division, which has underperformed its other businesses, Fettig said. “If not for this unlawful behaviour, we believe our washer category would have thrived like the rest of our North American business,” he said.

Advertisement Whirlpool Corp. is renewing allegations that its South Korean rivals illegally undercut prices on washing machines, setting up a trade fight that could be settled by the Trump administration. The American appliance giant announced plans on May 31 to file a petition with the U.S. International Trade Commission against Samsung Electronics Co. and LG Electronics Inc. The so-called safeguard petition is meant to provide help to domestic manufacturers hurt by importers selling products at excessively low prices. “This filing addresses unprecedented behavior by two serial violators of U.S. trade laws,” Whirlpool CEO Jeff Fettig said. The long-simmering conflict has the potential to become a high-profile test for President Donald Trump. Trade and domestic manufacturing were signature issues in his campaign, and Fettig serves as a member of the president’s manufacturing council. If the trade commission decides in Whirlpool’s favor, it could recommend that Trump’s administration step in and slap tariffs on the competitors’ products. Whirlpool’s filing would be the latest in a series of complaints companies have filed with the ITC, a federal tribunal that rules on trade disputes. Last month, Boeing Co. accused Bombardier Inc. of selling passenger jets in the U.S. at “absurdly low prices,” asking the U.S. to impose duties on the Canadian jet builder. ‘One-Way Street’ Trump has threatened to pull the U.S. out of its free-trade agreement with South Korea, calling the 2012 deal a “one-way street” that has only benefited the Asian country. The U.S. trade deficit with South Korea last year, at about $28 billion, was the eighth-largest shortfall among U.S. trading partners, according to Census Bureau data. Whirlpool’s dispute follows cases in which the U.S. government has determined that the South Korean companies injured U.S. manufacturers by selling washing machines in the country at illegal prices, Whirlpool said. “In light of their apparent inability to compete with leading global brands like LG in the U.S. market, Whirlpool has decided to seek government restrictions to limit consumer choices,” LG said in an emailed statement. The company said that in order for Whirlpool to succeed in its petition, it would have to prove that the imported goods are found to be a significant cause of serious injury to U.S. producers -- “a high legal standard that Whirlpool cannot meet,” LG said. Representatives for Samsung didn’t have an immediate response to the filing. The disagreement with the South Korean companies dates back years, with victories on both sides. In 2011, Whirlpool alleged that its overseas rivals were receiving unfair government subsidies and selling products in the U.S. at below-market values. In 2013, South Korea filed a World Trade Organization dispute challenging the U.S. Commerce Department’s calculations. It won a ruling from the WTO last year. Lagging Behind The situation has hampered sales at the Benton Harbor, Mich.-based company’s washer division, which has underperformed its other businesses, Fettig said. “If not for this unlawful behavior, we believe our washer category would have thrived like the rest of our North American business,” he said.

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, left, and U.S. President Donald Trump talk as they attend the Summit of the Heads of State and of Government of the G7 on May 26. A lot is happening this month in Canada-U.S. trade with at least four actions on the punitive front that Canada will be watching in June.  (PHILIPPE WOJAZER / AFP / GETTY IMAGES)   By Alexander PanettaThe Canadian Press Wed., May 31, 2017 WASHINGTON—The multiple ways in which Donald Trump could threaten Canada-U.S. trade will be on full display this month, with a series of looming decisions and public events that hold the potential to escalate disputes. One expert counts three pathways to pain: NAFTA negotiations, punitive actions, and pressure on CEOs to shift operations to the U.S. Gary Hufbauer says this flurry of individual actions will allow the president to point to immediate results in his “America First” agenda, giving him something to show voters in the 2018 U.S. midterm elections if NAFTA talks languish into the following year. “I think the NAFTA negotiations are going to be long, and tedious, and difficult, and not yield much fruit between now and the (midterms) in 2018,” said Hufbauer, a prominent trade analyst at Washington’s Peterson Institute. “So... these other parts of the agenda will be what Trump emphasizes when we come down to the congressional and senatorial races.” Article Continued Below Read the latest news on U.S. President Donald Trump A lot is happening this month. There are at least four actions on the punitive front that Canada will be watching in June: a report on Bombardier by the Commerce Department around June 12, which could lead to duties; a decision on additional softwood-lumber duties June 23; and investigations into the national-security implications of importing steel and aluminum, which Trump says will be released in June. There’s also a big hearing on NAFTA on June 27. The U.S. government will collect public input on what it should demand in negotiations later this year, and foreigners are invited to share submissions for the Washington event. Read more: Harjit Sajjan lashes out at Boeing over trade spat with Bombardier Hundreds of Quebec lumber workers among first to lose work after Trump’s softwood tariffs Trump’s ‘America First’ budget makes wall, defence priority over federal agencies Canada ‘very prepared’ for NAFTA renegotiation talks with U.S., trade minister says The Canadian government is preparing for this multi-front challenge: On Tuesday, Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan came within a whisker of threatening the U.S. company that launched the complaint against Bombardier. Ottawa has said it is reviewing plans to spend at least $5 billion on Boeing Super Hornet fighter jets. Sajjan said in a speech: “(This) is not the behaviour of a trusted partner.” On softwood lumber, Ottawa is threatening two other trade actions. It says it might ban exports of U.S. coal from B.C., and is also studying whether the state of Oregon’s business subsidies constitute grounds for punitive action. On steel and aluminum, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau pushed Trump during a chat in Sicily for a Canada exemption from any punitive action. The countries have relatively balanced trade in steel. In fact, Canada is by far the largest importer of U.S. steel — it took in 51 per cent of U.S. exports last year, Mexico took 39 per cent, and the next four countries took a mere one per cent each. The American cabinet official responsible for many of these trade actions is aware of this. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross told a congressional hearing last week: “We actually have steel surplus with Canada and Mexico, so that puts them in a little different position, as well as the fact that they are participants in NAFTA.” The Canadian government will keep taking its message on the road. Transport Minister Marc Garneau will be in Pennsylvania steel country Friday as the latest cabinet minister to travel throughout the U.S., spreading the message about $858 billion a year in bilateral trade of goods and services, the nine million U.S. jobs related to Canadian trade, and the $1.62 million of trade occurring every minute of the day. Garneau alone has been in Washington, D.C., Washington State, and Florida recently as the Canadian cabinet scours the continental United States is search of potential allies as these disputes arise. “It’s just making our American neighbours aware of just how much is at stake,” Garneau said in an interview. He’ll be meeting in Pittsburgh with two Republican congressman and with the head of the United Steelworkers union — Leo Gerard, who is Canadian. Gerard happened to be inside the Oval Office for the public event where Trump blasted Canadian trade in dairy, lumber, and energy. But Garneau warns against getting too exercised by this daily noise. He says he’s looking farther ahead, past June, at another big date: Aug. 16. That’s when the U.S. will have finished its NAFTA consultations and will be ready to present its demands to Canada and Mexico for the renegotiation. “The vast majority of what we’re looking at will be under NAFTA,” Garneau said in an interview. “There’s a certain amount of stuff that gets out there in the media that may not necessarily be what the United States’ final position is. “We know the art of negotiation. The real serious negotiations will be based on what is put on the table in front of us, three months from now. That’s what we will be focused on... That’s when the rubber hits the road.” Buy American is another issue on the transport minister’s mind. Domestic procurement could be a key sticking point in the NAFTA talks, and also surface as an issue in an eventual U.S. infrastructure bill. The last time it was a major irritant some Canadian companies responded by opening U.S. facilities. That’s the third kind of pressure Hufbauer expects to see, beyond sector-by-sector penalties and NAFTA harball bargaining. He says Trump already has pressed CEOs of major companies, especially in the auto sector but in others as well, with one purpose: “Threatening them to locate in the United States.” Read more about: United States, Donald Trump Delivered dailyThe Morning Headlines Newsletter Subscribe The Toronto Star and thestar.com, each property of Toronto Star Newspapers Limited, One Yonge Street, 4th Floor, Toronto, ON, M5E 1E6.

During the test, a Boeing-developed interceptor, carrying the Raytheon-built EKV, was launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base, following the launch of an ICBM from Kwajalein Atoll, stated an Aerojet press release, which added that the Aerojet Rocketdyne Alternate Divert Thruster (ADT) and DACS successfully maneuvered the EKV to destroy the incoming target. This first live-fire test is a major milestone for the decades-long, $330 billion ICBM program. This is akin to one bullet hitting another in terms of complexity and the distances traveled, noted some experts, and the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) called the feat an “incredible accomplishment.” “This system is vitally important to the defense of our homeland, and this test demonstrates that we have a capable, credible deterrent against a very real threat,”said director of MDA Vice Admiral Jim Syring in a statement. Prior to Tuesday’s launch, the last test had taken place in 2014. Success was not guaranteed Tuesday — in fact the GMD system only hit its target nine out of 17 tests since 1999, reports Reuters. The U.S. test comes as North Korea becomes increasingly hostile, increasing its missile tests and developing its own ICBM that can reach the U.S.mainland, around 5,500 miles from the hermit state. “We are replicating our ability to defend the United States of America from North Korea, today,” said Riki Ellison, founder of the Missile Defense Advocacy Alliance, prior to the launch. In this year’s budget proposal, the Pentagon requested $7.9 billion for the Missile Defense Agency and around $1.5 billion for the GMD program specifically. Critics of the program say that the tests do not adequately replicate battlefield conditions, because of the controlled environment and the system having real information no enemy would telegraph. Despite that critique, “this is an important day for homeland missile defense, and a bad day for Kim Jung-un,” said Tom Karako, of the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “Hit-to-kill has once again been validated, this time against an ICBM,” said Karako. “The Missile Defense Agency has been on a long road to improve the reliability and capability of the GBI fleet. For two decades, the United States has expressed an unwillingness to accept vulnerability against certain types of missile threats, like those from North Korea. Today’s test promises good things for the defense of the nation.” Share Facebook Twitter Google + Stumbleupon LinkedIn Tags Aerojet aerojet rocketdyne alaska BAN boeing co Center for Strategic and International Studies feature featured GBI GMD govcon Ground-based Midcourse Defense icbm intercontinental ballistic missile Marshall Islands MDA MDA Director Military.com Missile Defense Advocacy Alliance missile defense agency Reuters Riki Ellison Tom Karako U.S. Military Vandenburg Air Force Base Vice Admiral Jim Syring Related Articles General Dynamics Unit Lands $244M Navy Contract for Surface Combat Training Support June 1, 2017 May 31 Market Close: GovCon Index Closes Up as Indices All Close Down May 31, 2017 Fluor-CH2M-BWXT JV Lands $1.5B DOE Paducah Site Remediation Contract May 31, 2017 Check Also David Funk Named General Counsel, Corporate Secretary of Hitachi Data Systems’ Federal Arm David Funk, former general counsel and director of contracts at information technology services contractor Govplace, has joined Hitachi … Lockheed Martin Wins $19.8 Million for Work on F-35 Fighters Lockheed Martin Corp. ‘s (LMT) business unit, Aeronautics, won a $19.8 million contract modification for … Archives Archives Select Month June 2017 May 2017 April 2017 March 2017 February 2017 January 2017 December 2016 November 2016 October 2016 September 2016 August 2016 July 2016 June 2016 May 2016 April 2016 March 2016 February 2016 January 2016 December 2015 November 2015 October 2015 September 2015 August 2015 July 2015 June 2015 May 2015 April 2015 March 2015 February 2015 January 2015 December 2014 November 2014 October 2014 September 2014 August 2014 July 2014 June 2014 May 2014 April 2014 March 2014 February 2014 January 2014 December 2013 November 2013 October 2013 September 2013 August 2013 July 2013 June 2013 May 2013 April 2013 March 2013 February 2013 January 2013 December 2012 November 2012 October 2012 September 2012 August 2012 July 2012 June 2012 May 2012 April 2012 March 2012 February 2012 January 2012 December 2011 November 2011 October 2011 September 2011 August 2011 July 2011 June 2011 May 2011 April 2011 March 2011 February 2011 January 2011 December 2010 November 2010 October 2010 September 2010 August 2010 July 2010 June 2010 May 2010 April 2010 March 2010 February 2010 January 2010 December 2009 November 2009 October 2009 September 2009 August 2009 July 2009 June 2009 May 2009 April 2009 Recent Popular Comments Tags General Dynamics Unit Lands $244M Navy Contract for Surface Combat Training Support June 1, 2017 May 31 Market Close: GovCon Index Closes Up as Indices All Close Down May 31, 2017 IAP Secures Spot in Potential $37B Army Contract Vehicle; Doug Kitani Comments May 31, 2017 AECOM Names New Business Dev’t SVP Within Mgmt Services Group; John Vollmer Comments May 31, 2017 Northrop Grumman Taps Orbital ATK for B-2 Composite Parts Under $90M Deal May 31, 2017 Vectrus Lands $212M Army Contract Modification for Comms & Info Systems Support May 30, 2017 773 CSRA to Buy IT Firm NES Associates; David Keffer, Larry Prior Comment May 25, 2017 466 Tableau Software’s Sean Brophy: Agencies Should Advance Citizen Engagement Through Data Access May 30, 2017 402 DXC Lands $150M GSA Contract for Federal ID Credential Mgmt Support; Marilyn Crouther Comments May 25, 2017 397 4 Charts That Explain $95.7 Billion Trump IT Budget May 26, 2017 376 Jose: I believe Gregory Reyes is the right person for the job. he's got 28 years of pr...

"Following" : "Follow"}} May 31, 2017 10:26am   Comments Share: The Federal Aviation Administration is proposing a $435,000 fine against United Continental Holdings Inc (NYSE: UAL) for flying a passenger jet 23 times on domestic and international routes even though the plane wasn’t airworthy. The FAA alleged that United mechanics on June 9, 2014, replaced a fuel pump pressure switch on a Boeing Co (NYSE: BA) 787 in response to a problem reported by a flight crew two days previously. The FAA failed to perform a mandatory inspection of the work before returning the plane to service. “Maintaining the highest levels of safety depends on operators closely following all applicable rules and regulations,” FAA Administrator Michael Huerta said in a statement. “Failing to do so can create unsafe conditions.” Two of the 23 commercial flights took place after the FAA told United that it had failed to perform the inspection, which finally took place on June 28, 2014. The FAA says United has asked to meet with agency officials to discuss the incidents. A spokesman for the Chicago-based airline told the Associated Press that it’s working with the FAA on the matter. In an email exchange between Benzinga and United, United issued the following statement: "At United, the safety of our customers and employees is our top priority. We took action after identifying the issue and are working closely with the FAA in their review. United has had a rough year, public relations-wise. In April, a doctor was brutally dragged off a flight waiting to take off from Chicago’s O’Hare International Airport to make room for United employees.

United Airlines Related Media Gallery: Latest developments in cabin interiors Advertisement Chicago-based United Airlines will transition Boston-San Francisco flights to “premium transcontinental” service from July 1, offering 28 lie-flat business-class seats on each flight between the cities. United’s Boston-San Francisco flights will be operated with a mix of Boeing 757s and 777s. The route joins New York Newark-San Francisco and Newark-Los Angeles as United transcontinental routes featuring lie-flat business-class seats. In addition, United said business-class passengers on all three premium transcontinental routes will be offered new amenities starting July 1, including new dessert offerings and pre-arrival hot towel service and pre-arrival snacks. Also starting in July, economy plus passengers on the three routes will get meal service “including a complimentary hot fresh entrée, dessert and fruit, a pre-arrival snack and alcoholic beverages,” United said. United VP-marketing Mark Krolick added, “Flying between Boston or the New York area and the west coast can be akin to flying from the east coast to Europe, and we want to provide a satisfying and unparalleled meal in our economy cabin. This enhancement to economy plus is our first step toward a premium economy offering for our customers.” Dallas/Fort Worth-based American Airlines and Atlanta-based Delta Air Lines have brought back no-fee meals for all economy passengers on select transcontinental flights.

Just a few decades ago, California’s Inland Empire billed itself as “the Orange Empire” for the citrus orchards that fueled its primary industry. Today, many of those groves are gone, and so is the nickname. The landlocked region of 4 million people an hour east of Los Angeles now sprouts more enormous warehouses (a billion square feet of them) than fruit trees. Forty percent of the nation’s consumer goods—iPhones, sneakers, and everything available from Amazon—spend time sitting on those warehouse shelves after coming off ships at nearby ports, awaiting delivery to stores and homes. What was once a mostly rural region finds itself struggling with a high poverty rate and growing population. Residents are plagued by tremendous traffic and air pollution, which recently earned the region an “F” from the American Lung Association.

Thanks, Global Warming Emma Foehringer Merchant Veggies Grown With Toilet Water Could Be Headed to Your Table Emma Foehringer Merchant Silicon Valley’s Mission to Save California Ag From Dying of Thirst Those environmental and health concerns will get much worse, advocates say, if the city of Moreno Valley—a town of 200,000 located in the heart of the Inland Empire—builds the largest warehouse project anywhere in the country. Tom Thornsley is a 60-year-old urban planner who moved to Moreno Valley in 1998, just as the rural-to-warehouse transformation was beginning. He thought he had chosen wisely, settling in a gray, ranch-style home that sat near a wide-open space zoned for more homes, not warehouses. “I know better than to look at dirt and not check what it would be,” he says. But after a developer proposed a project in 2012, city officials rezoned that dirt patch next to Thornsley’s house to make it home to one of the world’s largest warehouse complexes. The World Logistics Center, planned by a company called Highland Fairview, would be the largest such facility in the country, covering 2,610 acres—the size of 700 football fields. It would be more than 25 times bigger than the largest warehouse in the United States, a 98-acre hangar operated in Washington by the airplane manufacturer Boeing. As a planner, Thornsley doesn’t have a problem with industrial development. He’s worked on commercial buildings since 1989. But the environmental costs of the World Logistics Center are too much for his community, he says, so he’s become a leader in the effort to stop it—an effort that might hinge on next month’s special city council election. The World Logistics Center, which is now known locally by the acronym “WLC,” has turned Moreno Valley politics into a bloodsport. Community organizers and environmental groups have fought—in both city hall and the courtroom—to protect residents from the pollution it would cause and save protected species like peregrine falcons and California golden eagles that live in the nearby San Jacinto Wildlife Area. Once built, warehouses don’t pollute the way that factories and power plants do. But a project the size of the WLC would be a magnet for truck traffic, spewing exhaust on 69,000 estimated daily trips in and out of the complex. In a struggling region, though, the lure of jobs has proven difficult to overcome, despite the public health and quality of life concerns. “That’s why people are pressing so hard now,” Thornsley says, “to get somebody elected who’s not going to be, in essence, another developer’s puppet.” Southern California’s two ports are among the deepest on the West Coast, allowing massive ships to dock at Los Angeles and Long Beach. More than $360 billion worth of goods from production centers in the Asian Pacific were offloaded there in 2014. Warehouses originally crowded around the ports, until Los Angeles could no longer contain the growth. Demand for more space at cheaper rates pushed development farther east, and the Inland Empire became the hidden purgatory between production and consumption. Only the Philadelphia area currently has more warehouse space, but projects like the WLC would leave that East Coast hub in the dust. Over the past five years, the logistics industry has delivered a quarter of the new jobs in the region. But the economic boom carries a heavy environmental toll: Diesel trucks zip along the Inland Empire’s roads, carrying cargo to customers and piping particulates into the air. Winds rushing in from the ocean blow added pollution from LA and Orange County, which accumulates in the basin bounded to the north and east by mountains. That makes the Inland Empire one of the unhealthiest places to live in the country. Air pollution leads to higher risk of heart disease, asthma, bronchitis, cancer, and more. The South Coast Air Basin—which encompasses parts of Orange, Riverside, San Bernadino, and Los Angeles counties—exceeds federal and state requirements for lead and small particulate matter, which can lodge in the lungs. San Bernardino and Riverside counties, which make up the Inland Empire, ranked first and second, respectively, among the top 25 most ozone-polluted counties in the American Lung Association’s 2016 air quality report. Low-income neighborhoods and communities of color bear the brunt of this pollution, because they’re often situated near freeways or become sites for warehouses. Moreno Valley’s population is 18 percent African-American and about 54 percent Latino. In a community where nearly 20 percent of people live in poverty, it’s easy for a big developer to gain support for a project like the World Logistics Center—especially with the promise of 20,000 permanent jobs and $2.5 billion a year added to the local economy. But the downside includes 14,000 added diesel truck trips per day and a 44 percent increase in the city’s yearly greenhouse gas emissions. Many warehouse jobs are also low wage, temporary, and unsafe. The facilities rack up a plethora of safety violations, according to California health and safety inspectors, and workers report high levels of injury and illness. Many residents believe “this is the best I can get,” explains Sheheryar Kaaosji, coexecutive director of the Warehouse Workers Resource Center, which advocates for employee rights. “That’s what it comes down to.” Tom Thornsley, who has decades of experience in urban planning, says development decisions are all about weighing the pros and cons. When a project is proposed, environmental risk assessments let you know how harmful the development could be, which tells you whether it’s worth it and if you can do anything to mitigate the harm. Ultimately, he says, if a project’s benefits outweigh its problems, “You just decide you can live with it.” In the case of the World Logistics Center, he can’t. An analysis of health impacts prepared for the developer acknowledges the potential for increased incidences of asthma, heart disease, and premature deaths. Thornsley’s dismay over another warehouse project—for the shoe brand Skechers, which opened in 2011 and brought a net job loss—pushed him to join up with Residents for a Livable Moreno Valley, a community group created to combat rampant warehouse development. The group has found itself battling a formidable nemesis in the person of Highland Fairview’s charismatic CEO, Iddo Benzeevi. During the protracted WLC fight, Benzeevi has become a folk hero to some Moreno Valley residents. When the city council narrowly approved the project in August 2015, residents swayed by the promise of jobs chanted “Iddo, Iddo, Iddo.” “They think he walks on water,” Thornsley says. “I honestly couldn’t tell you why they find him to be so adorable.” In public council meetings ahead of the vote, many residents lauded the project as a game changer for the city. “These are not jobs that are just back and hands, they’re technical jobs, they’re jobs that are going to be able to support a family,” said one woman who has lived in Moreno Valley for more than 30 years. “Most people recognize Moreno Valley as one of three things: crime, corruption, or unemployment,” says resident Leo Gonzalez in a series of 2015 YouTube videos supporting the WLC. “I believe we have the ability to change all that.” In addition to currying favor with residents, Benzeevi skillfully navigated California’s arcane political and environmental laws. Thanks to a 2014 California Supreme Court decision involving Walmart, ballot initiatives that garner enough residents’ signatures can escape the state’s Environmental Quality Act review process. Benzeevi took full advantage of that for the WLC. Meanwhile, Thornsley’s group pushed back. Residents for a Livable Moreno Valley filed lawsuits against the project, which has also faced separate legal challenges from the regional South Coast Air Quality Management District, Riverside County and its transportation commission, and a roster of environmental groups including EarthJustice, the Center for Biological Diversity, and the Coalition for Clean Air. “We already have among the dirtiest air in the nation,” says George Hague, a volunteer for the local Sierra Club chapter. “We keep trying to clean it up, but projects like this put us back.” Benzeevi disputes this, arguing that the benefits of job creation would outweigh the environmental impacts. “There is no better solution to reducing impacts to the environment than creating jobs where people live while utilizing the best available and viable clean technologies,” Benzeevi told Grist via an email from his public relations department. “This is precisely what the WLC does.” Benzeevi notes that Moreno Valley is requiring Highland Fairview to ensure that diesel trucks servicing the WLC meet a 2010 federal government standard for clean diesel. To which Hague counters: “They’re cleaner, but they’re not clean.” With options running out for WLC opponents, the special June 6 city council election to replace a single vacated seat represents a longshot chance to block the megawarehouse project, by putting an opponent on the board who can help overturn previous approvals. The council is now deadlocked 2-2. The open seat was previously held by Moreno Valley’s new mayor, Yxstian Gutierrez. A supporter of the World Logistics Center, Gutierrez won just under a third of the mayoral vote, but that was enough in a multi-candidate race. Benzeevi spent more than $160,000 to help his campaign. Highland Fairview is now backing a preferred candidate for Gutierrez’s open council seat, pouring tens of thousands into canvassing for his campaign through the Benzeevi-sponsored Committee for Ethics and Accountability in Government. WLC opponents are pinning their hopes on the three remaining candidates—one in particular has been an outspoken WLC opponent—who face long odds of winning. Whatever the election outcome, development in the Inland Empire shows no signs of slowing in the short term. But the environmental and health impacts of the logistics industry are starting to spur more awareness of the costs of warehouse growth. The California Air Resources Board voted in March to relocate its research facility to the Inland Empire’s Riverside County, which could potentially offer a more comprehensive understanding of the region’s poor environmental quality. And a bill in the state assembly is challenging the lack of environmental review in the initiative process—the very rule that allowed Benzeevi to push his megawarehouse project through local government. “We have such a disengaged citizenry—most of the people don’t understand the connection of the trucks to city hall,” says Kathleen Dale, a retired urban planner with the Residents for a Livable Moreno Valley group. “When you talk to people, this is a concern of theirs, but they’re not expressing it by going to the polls.” Go Back to Top.

REUTERS/Eduardo Munoz (Copyright Reuters 2017) United Continental (UAL) faces a potential fine by the Federal Aviation Administration for allegedly flying a plane that wasn’t in “airworthy” condition. Continue Reading Below The FAA said late Tuesday it’s seeking a fine of $435,000 over an incident that dates back to June 9, 2014. According to regulators, United mechanics replaced a fuel pump pressure switch on a Boeing (BA) 787, but the aircraft resumed service before the repair work was inspected. United flew that plane on 23 domestic and international passenger flights, the FAA claims. Crews performed the required inspection on June 28, 2014. The FAA believes that two of the flights occurred after the agency informed United of the missed inspection. “Maintaining the highest levels of safety depends on operators closely following all applicable rules and regulations,” FAA Administrator Michael Huerta said in a statement. “Failing to do so can create unsafe conditions.” The FAA said United has asked to meet with the agency to discuss the case.

(AMZN) Stock Really Get Much Better Than This? Buy Fitbit Inc (FIT) Stock for the Turnaround Recent Posts: Buy Fitbit Inc (FIT) Stock for the Turnaround Can Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Stock Really Get Much Better Than This? Why Boeing Co (BA) Stock Will Keep Getting Stronger View All Posts Politically, the U.S. military industrial complex is sacrosanct. It is, for lack of a better phrase, the ultimate trump card. Transcending all other chess pieces invoking race, gender, religion, or any number of social identities, no one dares say anything even remotely critical of the military. Just for that reason alone, Boeing Co (NYSE:BA) — specifically, its defense division — is virtually untouchable. Source: Phillip Capper via Flickr This sentiment for BA stock and defense-related investments is exponentially multiplied in the present geopolitical climate. I’ve got news for you — Russia is not our friend, and probably never will be. Of all the talk emanating from the White House, and curiously, several Republicans, I’m left with a basic question: Since when did friends ever point nuclear warheads at each other? Make no mistake about it, folks! We’re in a cold war. In fact, I don’t think we’ve ever left it. Since the end of World War II, the U.S. has waged a proxy war against the Russians. Even today in the global war against terror, our military operators confront terrorists armed with Russian weaponry. Bluntly speaking, our military industrial complex is in the business of destroying Russia. And as long as Russia exists, so too will demand for BA stock. Please don’t hate me for telling it like it is. I’m sure whatever is the Russian equivalent of Boeing stock is being yakked up by whatever is the Russian equivalent of InvestorPlace. All I’m saying is that ignoring the giant, pink elephant in the room may earn political points, but it’s not helpful profitability wise. Of course, BA stock is more than just Russia, Russia, Russia! Boeing enjoys tailwinds that have almost nothing to do with Russians. Instability May Spell Dollars for BA stock The most recent military-based catalyst is the Saudi Arabia arms deal that President Trump sealed. Worth nearly $110 billion — and the potential to boom to $350 billion — the White House characterized the contract as “a significant expansion of security relationship” between the two countries. Although Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) stands to gain the most from the arrangement, Boeing signed a significant amount of its own deals. In particular, BA stock could get a “two-fer” benefit from its passenger and military aircraft sales. With Raytheon Company (NYSE:RTN) planning to setup a Saudi division, the potential for BA to do more business in the Middle East is far likely than not. President Trump’s visit to the holy lands of the world’s leading monotheistic religions has highlighted an inescapable undercurrent: the U.S. military industrial complex has no shortage of conflicts to exploit. Along with our perpetual game of one-upmanship with Russia, the Trump administration caused waves when it attacked Syrian military targets. On top of that, we’ve launched fierce rhetoric against North Korea. During the campaign trail, Trump has repeatedly accused former President Obama of weakening America’s status on the world stage. Now, the tycoon has the keys to the car, and many American adversaries are egging him on. However this plays out, I imagine Boeing stock investors will at least be happy with their returns.

We will examine the RFI and take it forward," Lanba said on the sidelines of a seminar organised by FICCI on 'Building India's Future Navy Technology Imperatives'.      He, however, did not disclose the name of the companies which have shown interest in the proposal.      At present, the Navy operates 45 MIG-29K jets which face serviceability issues from time to time.     Currently, six planes are compatible for aircraft carrier. They are Rafale (Dassault, France), F-18 Super Hornet (Boeing, US), MIG-29K (Russia), F-35B and F-35C (Lockheed Martin, US) and Gripen (Saab, Sweden).      While F-18, Rafale and MIG-29K are twin engine jets, the remaining three have single engine.      The delivery of deck based fighter jets is expected to take four-five years.      The indigenously built aircraft-carrier Vikrant should complete trials in 2019. It was likely to be commissioned by 2020, Lanba said.      When asked about the recently approved Strategic Partnership (SP) model under which select private firms will be engaged to build military platforms like submarines and battle helicopters, Lanba said the next step would be to identify strategic partners.      "All three service chiefs will have to go and get the AONs (Acceptance of Necessity) on what we want to be built through strategic partners, so that partners in each segment can be identified.      "We are hopeful that we should be able to move this process in next six months," he said.      Four segments -- submarines, fighter aircraft, helicopters and armoured carriers/main battle tanks -- were identified under the new policy, aimed at attracting billions of dollars of investment in defence manufacturing by private defence majors including leading foreign firms.      At the inauguration of the seminar, Lanba stated that the Navy has taken giant strides in the field of indigenous ship design and construction and has made a transition from being a 'buyer' to being a 'builder'.      He, however, stated that despite the achievements in indigenous shipbuilding, the Navy continues to be dependent on external assistance for niche technologies.      "An important aspect in attaining 100 per cent self- reliance in ship design and construction, therefore, is the indigenous development of high-end technologies, their transition into shipborne equipment and systems, induction into service and standardisation," he said.      Holding that self-reliance in defence production is a vital pre-requisite for achieving greater strategic autonomy, Lanba said it is no easy task and would require dedicated efforts by researchers, designers and manufacturers.      Lanba highlighted the three primary requirements that need to be met while inducting a technology or a product – affordability, timely delivery and performance.     To these primary imperatives, the Navy Chief went on to add a fourth dimension – that of life cycle sustenance by providing seamless technical support and making the technology future proof.      He stated that this aspect is most vital for building a navy of the future and the support of the industry therefore extends well beyond just supply to life cycle product support.

The chief of naval staff also said the Scorpene submarine Kalvari is going through its final phase of trials and should be delivered by July-August. Having rejected indigenously built 'Tejas' as too heavy, the Indian Navy in January issued a Request for Information to procure 57 multi-role combat aircraft for its carrier. "The Navy has got response from four players for the RFI. We will examine the RFI and take it forward," Lanba said on the sidelines of a seminar organised by FICCI on 'Building India's Future Navy Technology Imperatives'. He, however, did not disclose the name of the companies which have shown interest in the proposal. At present, the Navy operates 45 MIG-29K jets which face serviceability issues from time to time. Currently, six planes are compatible for aircraft carrier. They are Rafale (Dassault, France), F-18 Super Hornet (Boeing, US), MIG-29K (Russia), F-35B and F-35C (Lockheed Martin, US) and Gripen (Saab, Sweden). While F-18, Rafale and MIG-29K are twin engine jets, the remaining three have single engine. The delivery of deck based fighter jets is expected to take four-five years. The indigenously built aircraft-carrier Vikrant should complete trials in 2019. It was likely to be commissioned by 2020, Lanba said. When asked about the recently approved Strategic Partnership (SP) model under which select private firms will be engaged to build military platforms like submarines and battle helicopters, Lanba said the next step would be to identify strategic partners. "All three service chiefs will have to go and get the AONs (Acceptance of Necessity) on what we want to be built through strategic partners, so that partners in each segment can be identified. "We are hopeful that we should be able to move this process in next six months," he said. Four segments -- submarines, fighter aircraft, helicopters and armoured carriers/main battle tanks -- were identified under the new policy, aimed at attracting billions of dollars of investment in defence manufacturing by private defence majors including leading foreign firms. The Ministry of Defence had recently scrapped navy's decision to appoint Flag Officer Delhi Area (FODA) and Flag officer Gujarat Naval area (FOGNA) without its consent. Responding to this, Lanba said, "We are in discussion with the Ministry of Defence and we will resolve it".

The report provides detailed insights on the market dynamics to enable informed business decision making and growth strategy formulation based on the opportunities present in the market. Winglets Market in the Global Aerospace Industry: Highlights  As per Stratview Research, the global aerospace winglets market offers a healthy growth opportunity of 9.7% CAGR during the forecast period of 2017 to 2022 and reach an estimated $559 million in 2022. The author of the report stated that increasing production rate of commercial and regional aircraft, certification of winglets as a standard equipment in the variants of the best-selling aircraft, such as B737 Max and A320neo family, increasing adoption rate of winglets by airlines in both the new as well as retrofit installations, winglet technology advancement, and increasing fleet size are the key drivers of the global aerospace winglets market. The research’s findings suggest that narrow-body aircraft is likely to remain the largest and the fastest-growing segment of the global aerospace winglets market during the forecast period of 2017 – 2022. B737 and A320 along with their recently launched variants would remain the growth engines of the winglets market in the narrow-body aerospace industry over the next five years.  In terms of winglet type, blended winglet dominates    the global aerospace winglets market, propelled by its certification in Boeing’s best-selling aircraft program B737, however, advanced technology winglet is projected to witness the highest growth during the forecast period of 2017 – 2022. Blended winglets offer 3% to 5% increase in fuel efficiency as compared to the aircraft without the winglets. As per the study, North America is projected to remain the largest market for winglets during the forecast period, driven by the presence of assembly plants of Boeing and Bombardier. The region is also manufacturing capital of the aerospace industry with the presence of major composite part fabricators and raw material suppliers. Asia-Pacific is the fastest-growing winglets market over the next five years, driven by upcoming commercial and regional aircraft with winglets as an option and high commercial aircraft fleet size.  The key winglet manufacturers are FACC AG, Korean Air Aerospace Division, RUAG Aerostructures, GKN Aerospace, Winglet Technology LLC, and BLR Aerospace LLC.

Mathematics, Science subjects to be taught in Hausa, Igbo, Yoruba Home / Cover / World News / US successfully tests ICBM defense system for first time US successfully tests ICBM defense system for first time — 31st May 2017 The U.S. military on Tuesday cheered a successful, first-ever missile defense test involving a simulated attack by an intercontinental ballistic missile, in a major milestone for a program meant to defend against a mounting North Korean threat. The U.S. military fired an ICBM-type missile from the Kwajalein Atoll in the Marshall Islands toward the waters just south of Alaska. It then fired a missile to intercept it from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. Experts compare the job to hitting a bullet with another bullet and note the complexity is magnified by the enormous distances involved. The Missile Defense Agency said it was the first live-fire test against a simulated ICBM for the Ground-based Midcourse Defense (GMD), managed by Boeing Co (BA.N), and hailed it as an “incredible accomplishment.” “This system is vitally important to the defense of our homeland, and this test demonstrates that we have a capable, credible deterrent against a very real threat,” Vice Admiral Jim Syring, director of the agency, said in a statement. A successful test was by no means guaranteed and the Pentagon sought to manage expectations earlier in the day, noting that the United States had multiple ways to try to shoot down a missile from North Korea. “This is one element of a broader missile defense strategy that we can use to employ against potential threats,” Pentagon spokesman Captain Jeff Davis told reporters. Prior to Tuesday’s launch, the GMD system had successfully hit its target in only nine of 17 tests since 1999. The last test was in 2014. North Korea has dramatically ramped up missile tests over the past year in its effort to develop an ICBM that can strike the U.S. mainland. The continental United States is around 9,000 km (5,500 miles) from North Korea. ICBMs have a minimum range of about 5,500 km (3,400 miles), but some are designed to travel 10,000 km (6,200 miles) or farther. Riki Ellison, founder of the Missile Defense Advocacy Alliance, described the test as “vital” prior to launch. “We are replicating our ability to defend the United States of America from North Korea, today,” Ellison said. Failure could have deepened concern about a program that according to one estimate has so far cost more than $40 billion. Its success could translate into calls by Congress to speed development. In the fiscal year 2018 budget proposal sent to Congress last week, the Pentagon requested $7.9 billion for the Missile Defense Agency, including about $1.5 billion for the GMD program. A 2016 assessment released by the Pentagon’s weapons testing office in January said that U.S. ground-based interceptors meant to knock out any incoming ICBM still had low reliability, giving the system a limited capability of shielding the United States.

The airline’s new premium section, to be featured on its Boeing Co. 777-300ERs, will have six private suites instead of eight, Emirates said in an e-mailed statement. The cabins will be presented in November sporting “a totally fresh new look,” said Tim Clark, Emirates president.

To cope with some of the toughest operating conditions in its 30-year history, Emirates is revamping the bars on its Airbus SE A380s, mulling a premium-economy class for the first time and considering introducing narrow-bodies to its all-widebody fleet in cooperation with low-cost sister carrier FlyDubai. The smaller cabins come just after Qatar Airways announced its Qsuite, a new business-class section with double-beds that morph into meeting rooms. The market for the most expensive seats on an aircraft is at a crossroads, with many carriers either scaling back first-class offerings, while others such as Etihad Airways are taking the opposite approach by adding three-room cabins. Emirates, which is also known for onboard showers, will show its new first-class cabins and the corresponding routes at the biennial Dubai Airshow.

Four players have shown an interest in providing the Navy with 57 multi-role combat fighter jets for its aircraft carrier, Indian Navy chief Sunil Lanba said on Wednesday. The chief of naval staff also said the Scorpene submarine Kalvari is going through its final phase of trials and should be delivered by July-August. Having rejected indigenously built 'Tejas' as too heavy, the Indian Navy in January issued a Request for Information to procure 57 multi-role combat aircraft for its carrier. "The Navy has got response from four players for the RFI. We will examine the RFI and take it forward," Lanba said on the sidelines of a seminar organised by FICCI on 'Building India's Future Navy Technology Imperatives'. He, however, did not disclose the name of the companies which have shown interest in the proposal. At present, the Navy operates 45 MIG-29K jets which face serviceability issues from time to time. Currently, six planes are compatible for aircraft carrier. They are Rafale (Dassault, France), F-18 Super Hornet (Boeing, US), MIG-29K (Russia), F-35B and F-35C (Lockheed Martin, US) and Gripen (Saab, Sweden). While F-18, Rafale and MIG-29K are twin engine jets, the remaining three have single engine. The delivery of deck based fighter jets is expected to take four-five years. The indigenously built aircraft-carrier Vikrant should complete trials in 2019. It was likely to be commissioned by 2020, Lanba said. When asked about the recently approved Strategic Partnership (SP) model under which select private firms will be engaged to build military platforms like submarines and battle helicopters, Lanba said the next step would be to identify strategic partners. "All three service chiefs will have to go and get the AONs (Acceptance of Necessity) on what we want to be built through strategic partners, so that partners in each segment can be identified. "We are hopeful that we should be able to move this process in next six months," he said. Four segments -- submarines, fighter aircraft, helicopters and armoured carriers/main battle tanks -- were identified under the new policy, aimed at attracting billions of dollars of investment in defence manufacturing by private defence majors including leading foreign firms. The Ministry of Defence had recently scrapped navy's decision to appoint Flag Officer Delhi Area (FODA) and Flag officer Gujarat Naval area (FOGNA) without its consent. Responding to this, Lanba said, "We are in discussion with the Ministry of Defence and we will resolve it."

A 3D-printed rocket engine just launched a new era of space exploration Technology Wednesday 31 May 2017 - 12:37pm Contributors: The Conversation Africa This handout from Rocket Lab taken on May 25, 2017 shows the Electron rocket lifting off from its launch site on the Mahia peninsular in Hawkes Bay. Photo: Handout / ROCKET LAB / AFP Candice Majewski, University of Sheffield The rocket that blasted into space from New Zealand on May 25 was special. Not only was it the first to launch from a private site, it was also the first to be powered by an engine made almost entirely using 3D printing. This might not make it the “first 3D-printed rocket in space” that some headlines described it as, but it does highlight how seriously this manufacturing technique is being taken by the space industry. Members of the team behind the Electron rocket at US company RocketLab say the engine was printed in 24 hours and provides efficiency and performance benefits over other systems. There’s not yet much information out there regarding the exact details of the 3D-printed components. But it’s likely many of them have been designed to minimise weight while maintaining their structural performance, while other components may have been optimised to provide efficient fluid flow. These advantages – reducing weight and the potential for complex new designs – are a large part of why 3D printing is expected to find some of its most significant applications in space exploration, with dramatic effect. One thing the set of technologies known as additive manufacturing or 3D printing does really well is to produce highly complicated shapes. For example, lattice structures produced in exactly the right way so that they weigh less but are just as strong as similar solid components. This creates the opportunity to produce optimised, lightweight parts that were previously impossible to manufacture economically or efficiently with more traditional techniques. Boeing’s microlattice is an example of taking this to the extreme, supposedly producing mechanically sound structures that are 99.9% air. Not all 3D printing processes can achieve this, but even weight savings of a few percent in aircraft and spacecraft can lead to major benefits through the use of less fuel. 3D printing tends to work best for the production of relatively small, intricate parts rather than large, simple structures, where the higher material and processing costs would outweigh any advantage. For example, a redesigned nozzle can enhance fuel mixing within an engine, leading to better efficiency. Increasing the surface area of a heat shield by using a patterned rather than a flat surface can mean heat is transferred away more efficiently, reducing the chances of overheating. The techniques can also reduce the amount of material wasted in manufacturing, important because space components tend to be made from highly expensive and often rare materials. 3D printing can also produce whole systems in one go rather than from lots of assembled parts. For example, NASA used it to reduce the components in one of its rocket injectors from 115 to just two. Plus, 3D printers can easily make small numbers of a part – as the space industry often needs – without first creating expensive manufacturing tools. In orbit 3D printers are also likely to find a use in space itself, where it’s difficult to keep large numbers of spare parts and hard to send out for replacements when you’re thousands of kilometres from Earth. There’s now a 3D printer on the International Space Station so, if something breaks, engineers can send up a design for a replacement and the astronauts can print it out. The current printer only deals with plastic so it’s more likely to be used for making tools or one-off replacements for low-performance parts such as door handles. But once 3D printers can more easily use other materials, we’re likely to see an increase in their uses. One day, people in space could produce their own food items and even biological materials. Recycling facilities could also enable broken parts to be reused to make the replacements.   Astro printing. Barry Wilmore/NASA Looking even further ahead, 3D printers could prove useful in building colonies. Places like the moon don’t have much in the way of traditional building materials, but the European Space Agency has proven solar energy can power the production of “bricks” of lunar dust, which would be a good start. Researchers are now looking at how to use 3D printing to take this idea further and develop complete printed buildings on the moon. To make many of these applications a reality, we’ll need to research more advanced materials and processes that can manufacture components to withstand the extremely harsh conditions of space. Engineers also need to work on developing optimised designs and find ways of testing 3D printed parts to prove they’re safe. And then there’s the irritating issue of gravity, or rather the lack of it. Many current processes use powders or liquids as their raw materials so we’re likely to need some clever tricks in order to make these function safely in a low or microgravity environment. Some of these barriers may even require entirely new materials and techniques. But as research goes on, 3D printing is likely to be used more and more in space, even if a fully printed space vehicle isn’t going to launch any time soon. The sky is no longer the limit.

Photo - AP/PTI   Sharelines US military successfully tests ICBM defence system for first time #US military successfully tests #ICBM defence system for first time Washington/Vandenberg Air Force Base (Claifornia): The U.S. military on Tuesday cheered a successful, first-ever missile defence test involving a simulated attack by an intercontinental ballistic missile, in a major milestone for a programme meant to defend against a mounting North Korean threat. The U.S. military fired an ICBM-type missile from the Kwajalein Atoll in the Marshall Islands toward the waters just south of Alaska. It then fired a missile to intercept it from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. Experts compare the job to hitting a bullet with another bullet and note the complexity is magnified by the enormous distances involved. The Missile Defence Agency said it was the first live-fire test against a simulated ICBM for the Ground-based Midcourse Defense (GMD), managed by Boeing Co, and hailed it as an "incredible accomplishment." "This system is vitally important to the defense of our homeland, and this test demonstrates that we have a capable, credible deterrent against a very real threat," Vice Admiral Jim Syring, director of the agency, said in a statement. A successful test was by no means guaranteed and the Pentagon sought to manage expectations earlier in the day, noting that the United States had multiple ways to try to shoot down a missile from North Korea. "This is one element of a broader missile defence strategy that we can use to employ against potential threats," Pentagon spokesman Captain Jeff Davis told reporters. Prior to Tuesday's launch, the GMD system had successfully hit its target in only nine of 17 tests since 1999. The last test was in 2014. North Korea has dramatically ramped up missile tests over the past year in its effort to develop an ICBM that can strike the U.S. mainland. The continental United States is around 9,000 km (5,500 miles) from North Korea. ICBMs have a minimum range of about 5,500 km (3,400 miles), but some are designed to travel 10,000 km (6,200 miles) or farther. Riki Ellison, founder of the Missile Defence Advocacy Alliance, described the test as "vital" prior to launch. "We are replicating our ability to defend the United States of America from North Korea, today," Ellison said. Failure could have deepened concern about a programme that according to one estimate has so far cost more than $40 billion. Its success could translate into calls by Congress to speed development. In the fiscal year 2018 budget proposal sent to Congress last week, the Pentagon requested $7.9 billion for the Missile Defence Agency, including about $1.5 billion for the GMD programme. A 2016 assessment released by the Pentagon's weapons testing office in January said that U.S. ground-based interceptors meant to knock out any incoming ICBM still had low reliability, giving the system a limited capability of shielding the United States. < Previous PageNext Page > STAY UPDATED Subscribe to our newsletter and be the first to know all the latest news Sign Up More in World Sukhoi jet crash: Two pilots confirmed dead Cyclone 'Mora' damages houses, triggers landslides in Mizoram Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose died in 1945: Government Gallery Related content TimesTV Pentagon successfully tests ICBM defence system for first time Recommended for you From no-hoper to crowd-puller, British Labour leader Corbyn gains ground Malaysia Airlines flight returns to Melbourne after passenger tries to enter cockpit PREVIOUS ARTICLE Militant attack kills six Pakistan police NEXT ARTICLE In pictures: Fighting continues in southern Philippine Oman #OmanPride Ramadan World Sports Opinion Business Technology Lifestyle Entertainment Advertising RSS Feeds Subscription TOO Apps Classifieds E Paper About us Blog Jobs Contact us Request a Quote Copyright © 2017 Muscat Media Group.

(AFP) The Indonesian passenger plane carrying 146 people skidded off the runway as it landed. A Indonesian passenger plane carrying 146 people skidded off the runway as it landed in the eastern Papua region on Wednesday, an official said, the latest mishap to hit the country's aviation sector. No one was hurt after the Boeing aircraft operated by domestic carrier Sriwijaya Air overshot the wet runway at the airport in Manokwari city, said transport ministry spokesman J. Adravida Barata. TV footage showed people being evacuated from the plane, as it rested on its belly on grass next to the runway. The airport will be closed for several hours so that the plane can be removed, Barata added. It is just the latest of many accidents for Indonesia's air transport sector. In February, a Sriwijaya plane carrying 192 people from China to Bali was forced to turn back after the crew realised one of its doors was not properly closed. In the same month, a passenger plane operated by Indonesian flag carrier Garuda skidded off the runway as it landed at the airport serving the city of Yogyakarta in heavy rain. The aviation sector has been booming in recent years as a growing middle class increasingly use planes to get around the vast archipelago, but critics say safety standards have not kept pace with the expansion.

The U.S. military fired an ICBM-type missile from the Kwajalein Atoll in the Marshall Islands toward the waters just south of Alaska. It then fired a missile to intercept it from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. Experts compare the job to hitting a bullet with another bullet and note the complexity is magnified by the enormous distances involved. The Missile Defense Agency said it was the first live-fire test against a simulated ICBM for the Ground-based Midcourse Defense (GMD), managed by Boeing Co (BA.N), and hailed it as an “incredible accomplishment.” “This system is vitally important to the defense of our homeland, and this test demonstrates that we have a capable, credible deterrent against a very real threat,” Vice Admiral Jim Syring, director of the agency, said in a statement. A successful test was by no means guaranteed and the Pentagon sought to manage expectations earlier in the day, noting that the United States had multiple ways to try to shoot down a missile from North Korea. “This is one element of a broader missile defense strategy that we can use to employ against potential threats,” Pentagon spokesman Captain Jeff Davis told reporters. Prior to Tuesday’s launch, the GMD system had successfully hit its target in only nine of 17 tests since 1999. The last test was in 2014. North Korea has dramatically ramped up missile tests over the past year in its effort to develop an ICBM that can strike the U.S. mainland. The continental United States is around 9,000 km (5,500 miles) from North Korea. ICBMs have a minimum range of about 5,500 km (3,400 miles), but some are designed to travel 10,000 km (6,200 miles) or farther. Riki Ellison, founder of the Missile Defense Advocacy Alliance, described the test as “vital” prior to launch. “We are replicating our ability to defend the United States of America from North Korea, today,” Ellison said. Failure could have deepened concern about a program that according to one estimate has so far cost more than $40 billion. Its success could translate into calls by Congress to speed development. In the fiscal year 2018 budget proposal sent to Congress last week, the Pentagon requested $7.9 billion for the Missile Defense Agency, including about $1.5 billion for the GMD program. A 2016 assessment released by the Pentagon’s weapons testing office in January said that U.S. ground-based interceptors meant to knock out any incoming ICBM still had low reliability, giving the system a limited capability of shielding the United States.

Kennedy airport The following is the full text of the message. “Over the past two decades, I have on several occasions come to the US on business trips and study tours, and every time I was greeted with the warm hospitality of American friends.  During this official visit to the US as Prime Minister of Vietnam, myself and other members of the high-level delegation of the Government of Viet Nam are delighted to see old friends and meet new ones who share our strong desire to promote the friendship and cooperation between Vietnam and the US, so that we can together write a new chapter in the history of the relationship between our two peoples.  Despite ocean apart, Vietnam and the US have bridged the distance and come closer together since the establishment of diplomatic relations 22 years ago.  With the courage to rise above ourselves and the spirit of “shelving the past, heading toward the future,” we have overcome many difficulties and challenges to turn from foes to friends and now comprehensive partnership built on strong foundation. US exports into Vietnam increased five folds in the last 10 years. During this trip, businesses from both sides will sign many deals worth billions of dollars, creating tens of thousands of American jobs and boost exports from the US to Vietnam and vice versa, thus raising the livelihood of workers in both countries.  Our economies are fully complementary and with increasing trade come stronger mutual benefits.  Vietnam is importing in fast increasing number Boeing airplanes, Lockheed Martin satellites to strengthen our transportation and communication systems, as well as GE’s turbines to transition to a greener and cleaner energy sector.  Underwriter Laboratories newly built lab is providing certification services to ensure Vietnamese products meet global standards.  Agricultural imports from the US, including 0.5 million tons of cotton and 1.5 million tons of soybean, maize and corn in 2016 alone, are helping Vietnamese textile and aqua-culture products engage deeper into the global supply chain. In return, we are exporting to the US shrimps, tra/basa fish, tropical fruits, apparels, and footwear that are well liked by American consumers.  In May 2017, Vinamilk, the Vietnamese biggest diary group, imported 2,000 high-yield dairy cows and is expected to buy another 8,000 from the US to produce high-quality milk for Vietnamese children. More than 31,000 Vietnamese students are pursuing their higher education in the US.  They will be enormous resources for development in economic, science and technology fields for Vietnam as well as the strong foundation for bilateral relations.  The Fulbright University Vietnam and the Peace Corps programme will soon be launched in Vietnam to give Vietnamese students access to a world class education system and English language learning opportunities.  Furthermore, they will also stand as the vivid testaments of our growing bilateral relations. In Quang Nam, my beloved hometown, our work to preserve the natural beauty of Cua Dai beach and the heritage of Hoi An Old Town receive the wholehearted support from many American friends.  We are also grateful to the experts and scholars from Harvard University (MA), Portland University (OR), University of Arizona (AZ) and many other US research and training institutions for sharing with us their experience in disaster relief, climate change response and human resource development.  Wounds of the war are being healed with efforts to clean up dioxin hotspots and unexploded ordnance.  This genuine and sincere assistance is the solid building blocks for mutual trust and understanding, hence the foundation for a lasting relationship between Vietnam and the US decades to come. More than 20 years ago, many Americans only heard of Vietnam as the name of a war. But nowadays, they know of Vietnam as a sovereign nation with an independent foreign policy, a partner that deeply values its relations with the US and constantly seeks to reinforce a stable, long-term relationship with the US on the basis of mutual benefits and respect for each other’s sovereignty, political system, in the interest of peace, security, stability, cooperation and development in the region and the world at large. We wish to establish a strong working relationship with the Administration of President Trump to ensure not only the interest of the Vietnamese and American people but also the benefits of the ASEAN Community, for the sake of peace, security, stability, cooperation and prosperity of the Asia Pacific and the entire world.  In November this year, Vietnam will host the APEC Summit 2017 under the theme of “Creating new dynamism, fostering a shared future”.

A lucky few veterans and other passengers had the opportunity to fly aboard the Sentimental Journey B-17 Bomber over the skies of Hays Tuesday. The Commemorative Air Force is a non-profit organization that is the guardian of the restored B-17. The B-17 was the work horse of the bomber fleet during World War II, dropping more than 640,000 tons of bombs during WWII. Boeing, Vega and Douglas produced 12,731 B-17 aircraft in five years during the war. The Sentimental Journey is one of only 10 B-17G’s still flying today. The Sentimental Journey did not serve in combat. It rolled off the Douglas line in Long Beach, Florida, in November 1944, and by the time the military took possession, the war was over. The plane was headed for the scrap heap but ended up being sent to Pacific to do mapping missions. The plane also was used for atmospheric nuclear weapons testing drone control. The plane finally did a stint in firefighting before in became a part of the Commemorative Air Force fleet. It took five years to restore the aircraft to its World War II fighting strength. Charles Vsetecka, 94, leaned on his cane in the shade of the B-17’s massive wing, as he waited for his turn to ride in the B-17. This slideshow requires JavaScript. Vsetecka, of Victoria, was a radar operator in a B-24 in the Pacific Theater during the war. His mission was to detect enemy ships and relay them to the pilot, who would radio the positions to the headquarters. Vsetecka recalled engaging the enemy and loosing comrades in arms. He thought he might lose his own life when a typhoon hit Okinawa. A friend reinforced their tent with boards, and it was one of a handful that were not blown away in the storm. Vsetecka said the B-17 flight was different than his days in the B-24. He spent most his time starring at the radar screen and not peering out at blue sky and green fields. Each of the B-17 bombers carried a crew of 10. Most of the crew were 17 to 19. A pilot might be as old as 22. Most of the men were small to enable easier mobility in the tight spaces of the B-17, usually about 5’2” to 5’4” and 120 to 140 pounds. The smallest crew member was usually the ball torrent gunner. Each crew member was expected to fly 25 missions in a tour, but some crew members flew 100s of bombing runs. The B-17 could carry 8,000 pounds of bombs on short-range missions (400 miles or less) or 4,500 pounds for long-range missions (800 miles). The bombers flew in box or diamond formations in groups of up to 250 to 300 planes per mission. The plane’s max range was 3,259 miles with a service ceiling of 36,400 feet, which made for a long, cold ride for the crew. Temperatures were measured as much as 40 below zero during B-17 missions. The crew members wore fleece-lined flight suits to stay warm. They also had oxygen tanks on board in the time before pressurized cabins. The “Flying Fortress” was so called for its heavy armaments, which were needed in the time before fighter escorts. The B-17 was equipped with 13 .50 M2 Browning Machine Guns. The Sentimental Journey will be available for public flights at the Hays Regional Airport on Saturday and Sunday. Cost is $425 per person for radio room/gunner seats (six total); $850 for bombardier seats (two total) – highly coveted in the nose of the airplane enclosed in see-through plexiglass. Passengers must be able to climb into aircraft. Radio room/waist gunner seats require climbing a three-step ladder; bombardier/navigator seats require climbing a six-step ladder. Earplugs are provided or bring your own. For more information on the Sentimental Journey or the Commemorative Air Force click here.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 31 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Orbital ATK OBV Rocket and ICBM Target Successfully Complete Missile Defense Interceptor Test DULLES, Va.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Orbital ATK (NYSE: OA), a global leader in aerospace and defense technologies, successfully launched and tested its Orbital Boost Vehicle (OBV) rocket for the U.S. Missile Defense Agency (MDA) as part of the Ground-based Midcourse Defense (GMD) FTG-15 Flight Test. The company also supplied its Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) target rocket for this critical national security system test. The OBV was launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base, California, on May 30, 2017. Orbital ATK provides the OBV to MDA as part of an industry team led by The Boeing Company (NYSE: BA). “This flight test was a major undertaking for Orbital ATK as we supplied both the boost vehicle for the interceptor and the target,” said Rich Straka, Vice President and General Manager of Orbital ATK’s Launch Vehicles Division. “Today’s successful test confirms the United States’ missile defense program stands ready to protect against long-range missile attacks, and we are proud to be a part of that team.” FTG-15 was the first flight of the “C2” configuration of the OBV, which includes upgraded avionics and safety systems to address new requirements and obsolescence issues with the legacy vehicles. It was also the first flight of the ICBM range target. MDA’s goal is to expand the Ground Based Interceptor (GBI) fleet to 44 missiles by the end of 2017. “Orbital ATK is honored to be a part of MDA’s charge to strengthen the national defenses from 30 to 44 GBI Interceptors in 2017,” said Straka. “We understand the importance of this goal and, we are focused on mission success.” Following a preliminary post-flight analysis of the data collected from the mission, MDA and the GMD team confirmed all primary OBV objectives for the interceptor test were achieved. These included pre-launch built-in test functionality, silo launch and fly out of the OBV, and accurate booster delivery of the Exoatmospheric Kill Vehicle (EKV) to enable intercept of the target. The MDA/Orbital ATK ICBM Team also confirmed nominal operation of the target, meeting all primary mission objectives. The ICBM is largest target in a broader family of targets that Orbital ATK supplies to the MDA for Ballistic Missile Defense System testing. Orbital ATK’s missile defense interceptors and related target vehicles are primarily produced at the company’s engineering and manufacturing facility in Chandler, Arizona, with solid rocket motor propulsion manufactured in Magna, Utah, and its vehicle assembly and integration facilities at Vandenberg Air Force Base, California, and Huntsville, Alabama. Today’s OBV mission was executed under the GMD Development and Sustainment Contract, which continues through at least 2018. Orbital ATK developed the OBV under a multi-year contract with Boeing that began in 2002. Together the OBV and the EKV comprise the GBI, which is assembled by Boeing. The ICBM target was provided under the Intermediate Range Ballistic Missile contract, which continues at least thru 2019 with options for additional target vehicles and launches. About Orbital ATK Orbital ATK is a global leader in aerospace and defense technologies. The company designs, builds and delivers space, defense and aviation systems for customers around the world, both as a prime contractor and merchant supplier. Its main products include launch vehicles and related propulsion systems; missile products, subsystems and defense electronics; precision weapons, armament systems and ammunition; satellites and associated space components and services; and advanced aerospace structures.

The FIRs, accessed by TOI, said the civil aviation ministry decided to purchase 111 aircraft for Air India costing about Rs 70,000 crore at a time when the airline was showing a profit of about Rs 100 crore and didn't have the capacity to purchase even a few aircraft. Due to this particular decision, the airline immediately went into huge losses, which increased every year to reach tens of thousands of crores, the CBI said, quoting from the allegation levelled by activist-lawyer Prashant Bhushan in his PIL before the Supreme Court. The FIRs mentioned an internal Air India report of 2000-01 which said the airline should only lease aircraft and not go for purchase. The view was overruled by the aviation ministry, the FIR said, quoting from Bhushan's allegations which led the SC to direct a CBI probe. It was decided in 2004-05 that Air India will buy 68 aircraft instead of 28, as originally planned, a decision which quadrupled the expenditure from Rs 10,000 crore, as originally estimated, to Rs 44,000 crore. This apart, the government also decided to buy 43 planes for Indian Airlines at a cost of Rs 8,399 crore. "Concerns regarding potential difficulties of Indian Airlines in successfully funding the acquisition process with a positive NPV (net present value) was raised within civil aviation ministry, but were ignored," the CBI FIR said, referring to one of the main allegations which led the court to direct the CBI to probe the alleged scam. Interestingly, the CBI said the acquisition programme had been under consideration since 1996 but never got traction, until 2004 when it suddenly picked up speed. "Between August 2004 and December 2005, the proposals were formulated by Air India, approved by its board, examined and approved by ministry, Planning Commission, department of expenditure, group of ministers and the cabinet," the FIR said. Not just that, Air India signed the contract with Boeing to buy 68 aircraft on the same day, December 30, 2005, that the government cleared the purchase order. The CBI said NACIL (National Aviation Company of India Ltd), incorporated to merge Indian Airlines and Air India, had an equity base of only Rs 145 crore, yet it made a commitment to pay Rs 44,000 crore for procuring 111 new aircraft. It said loans for the purchase were taken from US and Indian banks, pushing the airline into debt and huge losses. Similarly, the CBI FIR into the leasing of planes said the ministry and officials of Air India/Indian Airlines decided to lease planes "dishonestly without due considerations regarding proper route study and marketing or price strategy". "The leasing was done despite airline running with very low load because of largescale aircraft acquisition and several flights, especially overseas flights running almost empty at a huge loss," the CBI said. For example, Air India leased 15 expensive planes when it did not have pilots to fly the aircraft, the FIR said, emphasising that this was "known to everyone". In another instance of alleged irregularity, Air India dry leased four Boeing 777s for a period of five years in 2006 even when new planes for the airline were set to arrive in July 2007. This "resulted in five Boeing 777s and five Boeing 737s standing idle, leading to an estimated loss of Rs 840 crore during 2007-2009", the CBI said. The third FIR to probe Air India giving up profitable routes and schedules for private airlines alleged that "foreign airlines were given unrestricted entry into India and major routes were given to them without taking any reciprocal benefits". Air India gave up Kolkata-Bangkok, Kolkata-Dhaka, Doha-Kochi, Kochi-Kuwait and domestic routes like Ahmedbad-Jaipur, Mumbai-Vadodara, Pune-Goa and Mumbai-Patna and others. "On all these routes, private airlines like Jet Airways, Kingfisher, Go Air, Indigo, Spicejet, Paramount Airways etc started operating and made profits," the FIR said. On lucrative routes like Mumbai-Dubai and Mumbai-Doha, Air India reduced its flights and gave private airlines major market share, it added.

The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) blamed Ministry of Civil Aviation (MoCA), Public Sector Investment Board and Planning Commission, National Aviation Corporation of India Ltd for entering into a "disastrous" deal of acquisition of 111 Boeing and Airbus aircraft for the national carriers during UPA's regime. The FIR registered by the agency in this connection says all three organisations including MoCA, under the then minister Praful Patel, were fully aware that the purchase would be a recipe for disaster, yet allowed it to happen. MISUSE OF POWER The public servants of MoCA and Air India, by misusing their official positions ordered purchase of 111 aircraft pegged at Rs 67,000 crores. Such an ambitious purchase order was made without studying requirements, requisite transparency, and proper application of mind causing loss to the government exchequer. Reacting to reports, former civil aviation minister Praful Patel said in a statement: "The CBI started a preliminary enquiry in 2013 during UPA regime. I do not wish to comment on CBI action as it does not name any individual. All decisions were multi-tiered and collective. The aircraft purchase order was cleared by an EGOM headed by P Chidamabaram and the merger was cleared by an EGOM headed by Pranab Mukherjee. Both decisions were ratified by the cabinet." The entire acquisition was to be funded through debt (to be repaid through revenue generation), except for a relatively small equity infusion of Rs 325 crore by IAL. It was concluded in the CAG report that large acquisition was driven by the MoCA.

[Photo/Xinhua] China will ramp up resources to accelerate the approval process for C919, the country's first large domestic passenger plane, to obtain an airworthiness certificate, which may require thousands of test flight hours, the industrial regulator and the aircraft's maker said. The C919 is scheduled to go through about 729 test projects and 4,200 hours of flight before it obtains the certificate from the Civil Aviation Administration of China. Such a step is imperative for it to enter the commercial market, according to the Commercial Aircraft Corp of China, the C919's manufacturer. Li Dong, director of the industrial equipment department at the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, said that after C919's successful maiden flight in May, more effort will be made to boost its flight performance, beef up maintenance support and lower its operating cost. The ministry said it also will leverage the experience China has accumulated in certifying the ARJ21, the nation's first domestic commercial regional aircraft, to help accelerate the process for the C919. No specific timetable was discussed. Lin Zhijie, an aviation industry analyst at CARNOC, a major Chinese civil aviation website, said by taking multiple test flights, the C919 aircraft needs to prove it is safe to fly and can meet the operational requirements for commercial use. The ARJ21, for instance, has 3,418 reports showing it meets operational requirements. Lin said it took six years for the ARJ21 to obtain its airworthiness certificate because it was something no Chinese company had never before attempted. The aviation authority had to design the aircraft approval system from scratch. "But now, both the manufacturer and authorities have experience, relevant technology and talent. The process for the C919 will take less time," Lin said The twin-engine, single-aisle C919, which can carry 158 to 174 passengers, made its first flight in early May. It is part of China's broad effort to meet soaring domestic travel demand and break the global market duopoly of Boeing and Airbus. "Since launching the C919 project, China has made more than 100 technological breakthroughs in areas including the integrated design of engines and systems control," said Li, from the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology. He refuted foreign media reports that China was assembling rather than making an airplane. He said it is a common international practice in the aviation industry to source components from other companies. Boeing said 65 percent of the cost of its civilian planes goes to paying suppliers. Aviation Industry Corp of China, a domestic aircraft maker, has set up 16 joint ventures with foreign companies to supply products such as electric power system and braking systems to the C919. Steven Lien, president of Honeywell Aerospace Asia Pacific, said in an earlier interview that the C919 program represents a $15 billion to $16 billion opportunity for Honeywell over the life of the aircraft program.

Modi and Putin will meet on the third leg of the Indian leader's four-nation tour of Europe with the pair looking to bolster declining trade between the once key partners. Modi is the guest of honour at this year's three-day Saint Petersburg Economic Forum -- Russia's answer to Davos -- that Putin will use to push the idea that Russia has turned the page on a brutal recession caused by low oil prices and sanctions over Ukraine. "The message that you will get from government officials and probably President Putin is that Russia has adjusted to life with sanctions, to life with lower oil prices, and is now on the path to recovery," analyst Chris Weafer from Macro Advisory told AFP. For the Kremlin, India represents the sort of major emerging markets it wants to do more business with as it looks to insulate itself against geopolitical shocks with the unpredictable Donald Trump in the White House. "It is very clear that there will be a very strong statement that Russia is looking to diversify its political relations, is not looking to have one best friend," Weafer said. "Rather than praising China or being critical of Europe, they will try to say 'We are going to be diversified, we are going to be open'." - Boosting India trade - Russia and India enjoyed a 70-year alliance forged during the Cold War, when the Soviet Union was New Delhi's largest trading partner, diplomatic ally and main arms supplier, providing everything from tanks to aircraft. AFP/File / Tobias SCHWARZ Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi will be the guest of honour at this year's three-day Saint Petersburg Economic Forum But the relationship became unmoored following the collapse of the USSR, as India underwent an economic transformation and increasingly sought to build trade ties with Western nations. That process has accelerated in recent years as New Delhi has orbited closer to Washington, and Russia has fostered relationships with India's chief regional rivals Pakistan and China. Modi and Putin are expected to oversee a number of deals and discuss a framework agreement for Moscow to supply more reactors to a nuclear plant in southern India as the country seeks to reduce its reliance on highly polluting coal. A revival of two-way trade, which slumped to below $8 billion in 2015 despite an ambitious bilateral target of $30 billion by 2030, will be a key priority during Modi's visit, after he made visits to Spain and Germany and ahead of a trip to France. While India will occupy pole position at the forum, other visiting international leaders will include UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres and Austrian Chancellor Christian Kern. Bosses from US giants Chevron, Exxon and Boeing will be among 144 American firms at the event, the best attendance in years after Washington previously warned business leaders against attending due to political tensions. While Russia will talk up its recovery, the situation remains precarious and attention will also focus on talk of much-needed reforms to modernise its creaking economy. Analysts warned that with Putin likely to bid for another term as president at elections next year there are unlikely to be any radical changes. "The business climate isn't going to improve and the presence of foreigners in the Russian economy won't become more free or competitive," said Andrei Kolesnikov from the Carnegie Center. "Only those who manage to strike deals with people at the very top will be able to get involved." burs-gmo-del/am/kjl 1 Jun 2017 Previous Back to summary Next AFP's worldwide network The global network of Agence France Presse covers 150 countries Find out more Find out more Contact us If you have news to share or a question, comment or suggestion, contact us via...

The 340th EARS, part of U.S. Air Forces Central Command, is responsible for delivering fuel for U.S. and coalition forces, enabling a persistent 24/7 presence in the area of responsibility. (U.S. Air Force photo/Senior Airman Trevor T. McBride) Posted By: Oriana Pawlyk May 31, 2017 The A-10 is a Cold War-era ground-attack plane known for its iconic gun designed to shred tanks and for its tough titanium armor designed to take hits and keep flying. That durability is noticeable not only on the battlefield, but also increasingly on Capitol Hill, where supporters of the Thunderbolt II, popularly known as the Warthog or simply Hog, have seemingly succeeded in dissuading Air Force officials from renewing attempts to retire the snub-nosed plane. The Air Force’s fiscal 2018 budget request released this month calls for keeping its fleet of A-10s — which stood at 283 as of Sept. 30 — in service for at least five more years. To recap: The service — facing financial pressure driven by spending caps known as sequestration — made multiple attempts in recent years to retire the Warthog to save an estimated $4 billion a year and to free up maintainers for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, the stealthy fifth-generation fighter jet designed to replace the A-10 and legacy fighters. In 2016, then-Defense Secretary Ash Carter announced the A-10 retirement would be delayed until 2022 after lawmakers complained that doing so would rid the military of a “valuable and effective” close-air-support aircraft. However, fiscal 2017 budget request documents showed the Air Force still planned to remove A-10 squadrons in increments between 2018 and 2022 to make room for F-35A Lightning II squadrons coming online. RELATED: Air Force Kills Retirement Date for U-2 Spy Plane Members of Congress, notably Arizona Republicans Sen. John McCain, a former Navy pilot, and Rep. Martha McSally, who flew A-10s during her Air Force career, fiercely opposed the move, and included language in the bill that would prohibit retirement of the Warthog until the Air Force could prove the F-35 is able to perform similar missions as effectively on the battlefield. In October, Air Force Materiel Command chief Gen. Ellen Pawlikowski said the depot line for the A-10 was cranking back up as part of an effort to keep the Cold War-era aircraft flying “indefinitely.” The planes, which entered service in 1976 and have deployed to the Middle East, Europe and the Pacific, have played an outsized role in the air campaign that began in 2014 against the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, or ISIS, helping provide close-air support for Iraqi and U.S. partner forces on the ground. (A-10 fans describe the distinctive sound its seven-barrel 30mm GAU-8 Avenger rotary cannon makes when firing as “brrrt.”) So the retirement push appears to have dissipated — at least, for now. Indeed, the Air Force’s budget request for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1 includes modest funding for A-10 modifications in coming years. The service over the past decade worked with Boeing Co. to replace the wings on 173 of the aircraft as part of a program scheduled to wrap up this year. RELATED: Air Force Requests 4K More Airmen, 46 F-35s, No Bonus Changes For fiscal 2018, the service asked for $6 million in procurement funding to upgrade the A-10 with the latest version of the satellite-based transponder known as the Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast, or ADS-B, to comply with a Federal Aviation Administration rule for the new technology, according to budget documents. In addition, the service requested $17.5 million in research and development funding to test the ADS-B Out software on the A-10 squadrons through 2022, budget documents show.   This work “extends the viability and survivability” of the aircraft, according to an Air Force spokeswoman who spoke to Military.com on background because she wasn’t authorized to speak publicly about the budget request. “As long as we can continue to fund these fleets, they will be survivable and lethal.” Through the wing replacement program and maintenance work, the Air Force wants to preserve the longevity of the aircraft, potentially by doubling its life from 8,000 flight hours to 16,000 flight hours. In an interview with FlightGlobal earlier this year, then-Air Combat Commander Gen. Herbert “Hawk” Carlisle suggested new wings on the plane could keep it flying into the 2030s. The spokeswoman couldn’t say whether this program would be expanded into future years. “This is exactly why we need long-term budget stability and flexibility — no longer reacting to make tradeoff decisions year to year,” she said. “We’re not in the position right now, but we don’t know” what could happen next year.

Li made the call during his talks with German Chancellor Angela Merkel in Berlin. He is on an official visit to Germany for an annual meeting between the two heads of government, a mechanism that has been in place since 2004. The twin-engine C919 made a maiden flight on May 5 in Shanghai with five crew members on board but no passengers. The success makes China the fourth jumbo jet producer after the United States, Western Europe and Russia. With a standard range of 4,075 km, the narrow-body jet is comparable with updated Airbus 320 and Boeing's new generation 737 planes, signaling the country's entry into the global aviation market. China has taken pride in developing the homegrown jumbo jet, regarding it as a symbol of national strength. In 2007, the State Council approved plans to develop a large passenger jet. In November 2015, the first C919 jet rolled off the assembly line. More than 200,000 technicians worked on the project. A total of 23 foreign and domestic customers, including China's national carrier Air China, had placed orders for 570 aircraft as of May 5, according to COMAC, the manufacturer. COMAC has to seek airworthiness certificates from domestic and foreign aviation safety regulators before making its first deliveries slated for around 2019. Airworthiness is the measure of an aircraft's suitability for safe flight.

Firebrand cleric Rizieq Shihab, who helped organise mass protests against Jakarta's outgoing Christian governor, is accused of exchanging sexually explicit messages and nude photos with a woman. The warrant issued on Tuesday will be used to put Rizieq on the police's most-wanted list, reported Antara news agency. Rizieq, who is also being investigated by police over a separate defamation case, travelled recently to Saudi Arabia and has failed to return despite repeated summons from the police for questioning.

SECTIONS Home Market Companies Economy Tech Auto Mutual Funds Stocks Currency Opinions Todays Paper E-Paper Horoscope Photos Video Photo Story Home World news US says test shows missile defenses outpacing ICBM threat US says test shows missile defenses outpacing ICBM threat The U.S. military said on Wednesday that a successful test of defenses against an attack from an intercontinental ballistic missile shows the United States is staying ahead of the evolving ICBM threat from countries such as North Korea. By: Reuters | Washington | Published: June 1, 2017 1:55 AM A type of ICBM was fired from the Kwajalein Atoll in the Marshall Islands toward the waters south of Alaska. (Reuters) The U.S. military said on Wednesday that a successful test of defenses against an attack from an intercontinental ballistic missile shows the United States is staying ahead of the evolving ICBM threat from countries such as North Korea. Vice Admiral Jim Syring, the director of the Missile Defense Agency, said Tuesday’s test, at a cost of $244 million, portrayed a “very realistic” scenario based on American intelligence about where it believed North Korean or Iranian missile programs would be in 2020. “I was confident before the test that we had the capability to defeat any threat that they would throw at us. And I’m even more confident today after seeing the intercept test yesterday that we continue to be on that course,” Syring said a news briefing. A type of ICBM was fired from the Kwajalein Atoll in the Marshall Islands toward the waters south of Alaska. The U.S. military then fired a missile to intercept it from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. The test ended with a head-on strike, resulting in complete obliteration. You may also like to watch: Experts compare the feat to hitting a bullet with another bullet and note the complexity is magnified by the distances involved. The continental United States is around 9,000 km (5,500 miles) from North Korea. ICBMs have a minimum range of about 5,500 km (3,400 miles), but some are designed to travel 10,000 km (6,200 miles) or farther. “The interceptor that we flew yesterday certainly keeps pace with and I would actually say helps us outpace the threat through 2020,” Syring said. The test followed an increase in the pace of North Korean missile tests over the past year in its declared effort to develop an ICBM that has the ability to strike the U.S. mainland. Tuesday’s intercept was the first live-fire test against a simulated ICBM for the Ground-based Midcourse Defense (GMD), managed by Boeing Co. Previously, the GMD system had successfully hit its target in only nine of 17 tests since 1999. The last test was in 2014. However, the interceptor technology has been making steady advances throughout the life of the program. Syring said Tuesday’s test was made even more complicated by the use of decoys designed to throw off the interceptor. More tests were planned in coming years to advance U.S. defense capabilities, he said. Syring said the ICBM targeted in the test was representative of potential missiles that could be fielded by North Korea or Iran. Iran’s missile program is considered a threat by the United States and its allies in the Middle East. Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) test-fired several ballistic missiles in May and an IRGC official announced last week that Iran built a third underground ballistic missile production factory and said it would keep advancing its program.

It won’t launch a rocket into space any sooner than 2019, and Stratolaunch faces skepticism about its business plan for delivering satellites to orbit. Share story By Dominic Gates Seattle Times aerospace reporter Paul Allen’s monstrous Stratolaunch airplane finally rolled out of its hangar in Mojave, Calif., Wednesday, showing off its complete twin-hulled majesty for the first time. It will now spend many months on ground tests before a first flight. And it’s not expected to be used to launch a rocket into space — a mission that some observers are skeptical will ever make business sense — any sooner than 2019. Two tugs pulled the 250-ton giant from the hangar where it was built for Allen’s Stratolaunch Systems company by Scaled Composites, the specialty airplane-development firm founded by aviation pioneer Burt Rutan. Over the past few weeks, mechanics removed the last of the three-story scaffolding that had surrounded the aircraft during construction, leaving the aircraft’s full weight to rest on its 28 wheels for the first time.

Get 90% off digital access. Jean Floyd, chief executive at Stratolaunch Systems, said in a statement that the empty airplane, powered by six used 747 engines, weighs approximately 500,000 pounds. “That may sound heavy,“ Floyd acknowledged. “But remember that the Stratolaunch aircraft is the world’s largest plane by wingspan, measuring 385 feet. By comparison, a National Football League field spans only 360 feet.” The plane — nicknamed the Roc, after a mythical Middle Eastern bird so big it could carry an elephant in its claws — will have a three-person crew: pilot, co-pilot and flight engineer. They’ll be in the flight deck of the starboard fuselage, maneuvering the plane from far to the right of its centerline, while the port fuselage cockpit is empty and unpressurized. Stratolaunch is intended to carry a rocket slung beneath the central part of the wing, between the two fuselages, and release it at 35,000 feet. The concept is that the rocket will then launch into space and deliver satellites into orbit. For comparison, the empty weight of the world’s largest airliner, the double-decker Airbus A380 designed to carry around 550 passengers, is 610,000 pounds. And the empty weight of Boeing’s largest jet, the 747-8, is a paltry 435,000 pounds. Paul Allen’s aircraft is 238 feet from nose to tail, and it stands 50 feet tall from the ground to the top of the vertical tail. It will carry about 250,000 pounds of fuel and a rocket payload of up to 550,000 pounds or 275 tons, giving it a maximum takeoff weight of 1.3 million pounds — equal to the fully loaded weight of the A380. There’s plenty of skepticism about Stratolaunch’s business plan for delivering satellites to orbit using this behemoth plane. Related stories Greater Seattle area space entrepreneurs take on the new frontier (2015) Tech billionaires aim for cheaper spaceflight (2015) Since Allen first put forward the idea in 2011, both Elon Musk’s SpaceX and Jeff Bezos’s Blue Origin have successfully pioneered new reusable ground-launched rockets that are already dramatically lowering the cost of access to space. And the satellite business has changed, with demand shifting toward small satellites going to low Earth orbit, not the huge, minivan-sized satellites that used to be standard. The airplane may be simply too colossal and therefore too expensive to be used to launch smaller satellites. Progress on the project has been slow. A year ago, Stratolaunch’s leadership indicated that it hoped for a rollout by the end of 2016. Yet driven by Allen’s passion for space and science fiction and funded by the billionaire — courtesy of co-founding Microsoft more than 40 years ago — construction of the airframe is complete and the Roc has finally emerged to the light of day. Floyd on Wednesday laid out an extended time frame, though he didn’t specify when the aircraft might first take to the air. “Over the coming weeks and months” at the Mojave Air and Space Port, the aircraft will undergo “ground testing, engine runs, taxi tests and ultimately first flight,” Floyd said. “Stratolaunch is on track to perform its first launch demonstration as early as 2019,” he added.

The global graphite market is projected to reach USD 29.05 Billion by 2022, at a CAGR of 5.2% from 2017 to 2022. Steel, automotive, and aerospace are the key end-use industries of graphite-based products. However, graphite-based composites are also being used in other industries, including marine, sporting goods, pipes & tanks, and construction. Owing to the exceptional property of graphite in supporting large batteries, the demand for graphite for the manufacture of commercially viable electric and hybrid vehicles has increased significantly in the last three to five years. Different grades of graphite are available for specific uses in diverse applications. Thus, the use of graphite in an increasing number of applications is expected to provide growth opportunities for the graphite market in the coming years. Graphite is widely used in the aerospace industry, as it facilitates the development of lightweight structural parts that help improve fuel efficiency. Graphite has high strength-to-weight capability as compared to traditional aerospace materials, such as metals, and plastics, among others. This enables the production of efficient designs, both structurally and aerodynamically. Aircraft manufacturers such as Boeing and Airbus are increasingly using composites manufactured using graphite. Graphite is also suitable for use in military applications, where high heat tolerance, strength, and rigidity are required. On the basis of application, the refractory segment led the graphite market in 2016. The growth of this segment can be attributed to the rapid industrial development and the increased demand for graphite from industries, such as automotive, construction, aerospace, and metal production, among others in the region.

Required fields are marked * Comment Some HTML is OK Sign me up for the Money Morning newsletter Name * Email * Website 6  ×  5  =  When you pick up shares of the best dividend stocks to buy now, you get two things – profits as share prices rise, and cash. As you know, companies that have dividend policies pay you money each quarter just for holding their stock. You can take the cash or reinvest it (which is an incredibly profitable strategy that we outline for you in this video). Video How Do Dividend Reinvestment Programs (DRIPs) Work? The best dividend stocks (like the ones we're about to show you here) also outperform the broader stock market because they're financially stable. For example, one of the most stable and popular dividend stocks is McDonald's Corp. (NYSE: MCD). Shares of this company are known for being unaffected by broader market volatility. During the financial crisis that lasted roughly from Aug. 10, 2007, to March 6, 2009, the Dow Jones plunged 46.8%. On the other hand, MCD stock actually gained 7.4% over the same period. McDonald's is also a "dividend aristocrat." This refers to an S&P 500 company that's hiked its dividend at least 25 years in a row. The company has gone far beyond that minimum and raised its dividend once a year for the last 40 years. It last hiked its dividend by 5.6% on Nov. 29, 2016, from a quarterly payout of $0.89 per share to $0.94. That gave the stock a yield of 3.1% — the highest since November 2015. But dividend investing isn't as simple as picking any popular dividend aristocrat, buying the stock, and sitting back. Our Money Morning investing gurus select dividend stocks not only because they have a large dividend, but also because they're poised to keep that large dividend going forward. This ability to maintain payouts to shareholders comes from the company's presence in a strong and profitable market, which will also lead to share-price appreciation over time. Here are seven of the best dividend stocks to buy this year… Best Dividend Stocks to Buy No. 7: Magellan Midstream Partners LP Company: Magellan Midstream Partners LP Share Price: $72.79 Quarterly Dividend Payment: $0.87 Dividend Yield: 4.8% Date of First Dividend Payment: April 27, 2001 One of Money Morning Global Energy Strategist Dr. Kent Moors' favorite energy stocks also happens to boast a strong dividend – Magellan Midstream Partners LP (NYSE: MMP). Magellan is a master limited partnership (MLP), which is a company that makes 90% of its total revenue from oil or other natural resources and usually operates in the midstream sector. In other words, it stores and transports oil instead of producing (upstream) or selling (downstream). Because MLPs only rely on transporting and storing oil, they make money regardless of how oil prices are performing. As long as the oil keeps flowing, companies like Magellan keep raking in revenue. As the WTI crude oil price fell 5.8% during Q1 2017, Magellan posted income of $222.7 million. That was up 7.6% from $207 million in the year-ago quarter. But one of the biggest reasons we like Magellan in 2017 is its strong presence in the $1 trillion "Permania" oil boom. That refers to the insane output growth happening right now in the Permian Basin, which stretches across New Mexico and Texas. The U.S. Geological Survey reported in 2016 there were as many as 20 billion barrels of oil in just one region of the Permian Basin. Since Magellan is one of North America's largest oil transporters with 10,000 miles of pipelines, it stands to earn millions in revenue from this massive oil boom. Magellan is also adding roughly 1.7 million barrels of new oil capacity to its pipelines that stretch from the Permian to its Gulf Coast facilities. In other words, Magellan will be making a lot more money with newly expanded transportation capacity. The company already has a huge 36.4% profit margin, meaning 36.4% of Magellan's revenue becomes profit. As revenue increases from the Permian boom, the firm's big profit margin ensures profits will increase as well. According to a survey of Thomson Reuters analysts, MMP stock could rise 23.6% from its current $72.79 price to $90 by May 2018. And the Magellan dividend makes this an even stronger investment. It currently boasts an annual dividend of $3.48 for a yield of 4.8%. That's more than double the average 1.93% yield of the entire S&P 500. Magellan's combination of a 23.6% return and 4.8% yield make it one of the best oil dividend stocks to invest in this year. Best Dividend Stocks to Buy No. 6: American Water Works Co. Inc. Company: American Water Works Co. Inc. Share Price: $77.93 Quarterly Dividend Payment: $0.41 Dividend Yield: 2.13% Date of First Dividend Payment: Aug. 13, 2008 Freshwater is a much scarcer resource than people realize, and American Water Works Co. Inc. (NYSE: AWK) is the best way to make big returns from the growing problem. Although 70% of the Earth is covered in water, only about 2.5% of it is usable for bathing, drinking, and cooking. National Geographic also estimates that only 0.007% of the Earth's water is available to the global population of 7.5 billion people. This chart shows just how bad the problem could become… As you can see, time is quickly running out to solve the problem. According to data from the United Nations, there will be 40% less water than we need by 2030 if the problem continues at its current rate. This – combined with the global population projected to increase by 29% to 9.7 billion people by 2050 – could turn the freshwater problem into a full-blown crisis. This freshwater scarcity ties into two of Money Morning Keith Fitz-Gerald's "Unstoppable Trends." You see, the trick to making huge profits is to find "must-have" companies that fall into what Keith calls the six Unstoppable Trends: medicine, technology, demographics, scarcity and allocation, energy, and war, terrorism, and ugliness (also known as defense). The Unstoppable Trends are backed by trillions of dollars that Washington cannot derail, the Fed cannot meddle with, and Wall Street cannot hijack. The Unstoppable Trends we're targeting here are "demographics and scarcity/allocation." The demographics trend ties into the massive population growth projected by the UN. Meanwhile, the scarcity/allocation trend ties into the simple fact that Earth's resources – especially water – will run out eventually. And every resource shortage always creates a transfer of wealth that opens up huge profit opportunities for investors who know where to look. That's why Keith's recommended investing in AWK stock since December 2011. American Water Works is the largest public water utility company in the United States and serves 15 million people. It provides maintenance for wastewater facilities and sewer lines that transport water across the country. If you bought AWK stock near $31.20 in December 2011 and held it until $77.93 today, you'd have a 149.8% return. Those returns will only keep growing thanks to the company's presence in a market with everlasting demand. "American Water Works is a rock-solid choice that will shield you from market volatility," Keith said. The quarterly AWK dividend has also grown considerably over the last six years. In fact, it's nearly doubled from $0.23 per share in December 2011 to $0.41 today, currently boasting a 2.13% yield. Since its IPO in April 2008, American Water Works has raised its dividend every single year. The AWK dividend even saw double-digit increases every year between 2013 and 2016, rising 12%, 11%, 10%, and 10%, respectively. Best Dividend Stocks to Buy No. 5: Apple Inc. Company: Apple Inc. Share Price: $153 Quarterly Dividend Payment: $0.63 Dividend Yield: 1.65% Date of First Dividend Payment: Nov. 21, 1988 Yes, its 32.2% return to $153 a share this year has made it one of the most profitable tech stocks of 2017. But Apple Inc. (Nasdaq: AAPL) also boasts one of the strongest dividends on the market despite problems with its dividend policy in the past. You see, Apple paid steady dividends from 1988 to 1995. Over that time period, the quarterly payout increased 20% from $0.10 per share to $0.12. However, the company started mounting huge losses mainly due to the sales failure of the Newton, a line of personal digital assistants that sucked $100 million out of Apple during the mid-1990s. When co-founder Steve Jobs returned to the company in 1997, the dividend policy was nixed so Apple could start growing its cash reserves. By August 2012, Apple's cash reserves had reached around $100 billion. That was when the firm decided to reinstate its dividend at $0.38 per quarter – more than triple its last $0.12 quarterly payout 17 years prior. The quarterly AAPL dividend currently sits at $0.63 per share. With that, Apple is one of the only leading tech companies to pay a dividend. Other giants like Alphabet Inc. (Nasdaq: GOOGL), Amazon.com Inc. (Nasdaq: AMZN), and Facebook Inc. (Nasdaq: FB) don't have dividend policies. That's one reason Money Morning Capital Wave Strategist Shah Gilani considers Apple stock one of the best value stocks to buy. But it's undoubtedly proved to be a great growth stock as it's gained 17.2% to $153 since Shah re-recommended it on Feb. 7, when shares traded at $130.54. "Apple Inc. keeps defying gravity," Shah told Money Morning readers on Feb. 7. "Its most recent earnings story was just extraordinary. Records are just being blown away left and right. And, believe it or not (and you'd better believe it), the stock is still cheap." Apple's share appreciation and generous dividend compared to other tech titans makes it more than worth your money this year. Best Dividend Stocks to Buy No. 4: Scotts Miracle-Gro Co. Company: Scotts Miracle-Gro Co. Share Price: $86.32 Quarterly Dividend Payment: $0.50 Dividend Yield: 2.32% Date of First Dividend Payment: Aug. 16, 2005 Founded in 1868, Scotts Miracle-Gro Co. (NYSE: SMG) manufactures and sells a wide variety of garden products. The uses for its line of products have traditionally included insect control, lawn fertilization, gardening, and landscaping. While it's long been a leader in the gardening and lawn-care market, Scotts Miracle-Gro has recently been pushing into the marijuana sector. This is one of the biggest reasons why Money Morning Director of Tech & Venture Capital Research Michael A. Robinson likes SMG stock. "Scotts is already the world's largest maker of lawn-care and gardening products, and is now making a big push into indoor plant cultivation, as evidenced by its April 2015 $150 million purchase of General Hydroponics and other pot-related acquisitions," Robinson said in November 2016. Must Read: Former Google Exec Quits Dream Job to Launch Marijuana Empire The explosive growth of the marijuana market will be a huge catalyst for the SMG stock price. According to New Frontier Data's 2017 Cannabis Industry Annual Report, medical marijuana sales are expected to soar from $4.7 billion last year to $13.3 billion by 2020. The cannabis industry is also expected to create more than 250,000 jobs in the next three years – more than utilities, manufacturing, or even government jobs. A recent Yahoo Finance survey of analysts show shares of Scotts Miracle-Gro could rise to $105 in the next 12 months. That would be a return of 21.6% from the current price of $86.32. While that may not be a huge profit, SMG stock more than makes up for it with a yield of 2.32% and quarterly dividend of $0.50 per share. The firm's dividend has increased every year since 2013, rising 13.6% from $0.44 to $0.50. The SMG dividend is also bigger than those offered by close peers Central Garden & Pet Co. (Nasdaq: CENT) and Andersons Inc. (Nasdaq: ANDE). Central Garden doesn't offer a dividend, while Andersons only pays $0.16 per share for a 1.82% yield. Best Dividend Stocks to Buy No. 3: Lockheed Martin Corp. Company: Lockheed Martin Corp. Share Price: $279.88 Quarterly Dividend Payment: $1.82 Dividend Yield: 2.6% Date of First Dividend Payment: May 25, 1995 With shares currently at an all-time high and expected to go higher, Lockheed Martin Corp. (NYSE: LMT) is one of the best defense stocks to own that also happens to have a strong dividend. On Monday, May 22, LMT stock climbed 1.5% to a record high of $276.92. The gains came after President Trump made a deal with Saudi Arabia for the country to purchase more than $28 billion worth of missiles, Black Hawk helicopters, and other defense weapons from Lockheed. The Saudi government agreed to spend $110 billion overall on defense contracts, which also lifted shares of peers Raytheon Co. (NYSE: RTN) and Boeing Co. (NYSE: BA). Lockheed Martin stock is up 18.5% since May 2016 thanks mostly to Trump's promise to increase military spending by $54 billion. That – combined with clearly strong international demand for the company's products – could send the LMT stock price soaring this year. Money Morning Technical Trading Specialist D.R. Barton consistently recommends Lockheed Martin stock. Since his last recommendation on May 10, 2016, shares have gained 12.7% from $244.36 to the current price of $279.88. But shares still have more room to run. Analysts say the stock could rise to $330 per share by May 2018. This would represent a 17.9% return for investors if they buy in at the current price. On top of those solid gains, Lockheed offers shareholders a quarterly dividend of $1.82, good for a 2.6% yield. That beats out the Northrop Grumman Corp. (NYSE: NOC) dividend of $1 (1.55% yield) and United Technologies Corp. (NYSE: UTX) dividend of $0.66 (2.18% yield). With growing demand for defense weapons overseas and a big dividend to boot, LMT is a great investment for both growth and value investors. Best Dividend Stocks to Buy No. 2: Sanofi SA Company: Sanofi SA Share Price: $49.41 Quarterly Dividend Payment: $1.58 Dividend Yield: 3.19% Date of First Dividend Payment: May 28, 2003 Another one of the best dividend stocks to buy in 2017 is France's largest pharmaceutical company – Sanofi SA (NYSE ADR: SNY). This pharma giant – which is also the fifth-largest drugmaker in the world – produces some of the most recognizable and consumed medications on the market. These brands include leukemia treatment Lemtrada and sleeping medication Ambien. Michael Robinson likes Sanofi because of its huge pipeline of blockbuster drugs coming to market. Of the 44 total medications in the pipeline, 13 of them are already in phase 3 clinical trials. According to Michael, about half of those drugs in phase 3 have come from partnerships with other companies. Sanofi's collaboration with other firms is a good way to save cash that could later be used to hike its dividend or fund other projects. "This is something we're seeing more and more of in pharma these days," Michael told Money Morning readers on April 26. "In my view, it's a smart move to help split up the costs and risks of new drug development." But the even bigger catalyst for SNY stock will be the company's expansion into the Chinese market. China already makes up one-third of Sanofi's revenue and is the firm's third-largest buyer behind the United States and France. According to a March 21 report by The Wall Street Journal, the company projects sales in China will increase by at least 10% in 2017. That would be up from a strong 2 billion euros ($2.15 billion) last year. With plans to release more than 10 new drugs in China by 2020, Sanofi is perfectly poised for long-term growth just in that market alone. "Given the relative immaturity of China's biotech and generic drugmakers, it will be years until they stop looking to the West for help managing their pharmaceutical demands," Michael said. "Those years of baked-in growth suit Sanofi just fine." Sanofi provides a dividend of $1.58 per share and has a 3.19% dividend yield. For comparison, the SNY dividend beats out Merck & Co. Inc.'s (NYSE: MRK) $0.47 dividend (2.88% yield) and Johnson & Johnson's (NYSE: JNJ) $0.84 dividend (2.62%). Now, our No. 1 dividend stock pick isn't exactly a traditional stock. It primarily focuses on bonds and income investments rather than goods and services, like the previous six companies. However, this company has the highest yield out of any of our picks, meaning it's the company that's arguably the most dedicated to giving most of its profits back to shareholders. Here's our pick… Join the conversation. Click here to jump to comments… (0) COMMENTS FACEBOOK COMMENTS TAGS Tags: Dividends Leave a Reply Click here to cancel reply.

"I was confident before the test that we had the capability to defeat any threat that they would throw at us. And I'm even more confident today after seeing the intercept test yesterday that we continue to be on that course," Syring said a news briefing. A type of ICBM was fired from the Kwajalein Atoll in the Marshall Islands toward the waters south of Alaska. The U.S. military then fired a missile to intercept it from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. The test ended with a head-on strike, resulting in complete obliteration. Experts compare the feat to hitting a bullet with another bullet and note the complexity is magnified by the distances involved. The continental United States is around 9,000 km (5,500 miles) from North Korea. ICBMs have a minimum range of about 5,500 km (3,400 miles), but some are designed to travel 10,000 km (6,200 miles) or farther."The interceptor that we flew yesterday certainly keeps pace with and I would actually say helps us outpace the threat through 2020," Syring said.The test followed an increase in the pace of North Korean missile tests over the past year in its declared effort to develop an ICBM that has the ability to strike the U.S. mainland. Tuesday's intercept was the first live-fire test against a simulated ICBM for the Ground-based Midcourse Defense (GMD), managed by Boeing Co. Previously, the GMD system had successfully hit its target in only nine of 17 tests since 1999. The last test was in 2014. However, the interceptor technology has been making steady advances throughout the life of the program. Syring said Tuesday's test was made even more complicated by the use of decoys designed to throw off the interceptor. More tests were planned in coming years to advance U.S. defense capabilities, he said.Syring said the ICBM targeted in the test was representative of potential missiles that could be fielded by North Korea or Iran. Iran's missile program is considered a threat by the United States and its allies in the Middle East.Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) test-fired several ballistic missiles in May and an IRGC official announced last week that Iran built a third underground ballistic missile production factory and said it would keep advancing its program.

Vice Admiral Jim Syring, the director of the Missile Defense Agency, said Tuesday's test, at a cost of $244 million, portrayed a "very realistic" scenario based on American intelligence about where it believed North Korean or Iranian missile programs would be in 2020. "I was confident before the test that we had the capability to defeat any threat that they would throw at us. And I'm even more confident today after seeing the intercept test yesterday that we continue to be on that course," Syring said a news briefing.
