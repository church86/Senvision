The US aerospace major delivered 748 planes last year, down from 762 in 2015. Boeing booked orders for 668 planes, down 13 per cent in from orders in 2015. The 2016 orders are worth us$94.1bn at list prices, it said. Boeing’s archrival Airbus said in November that it was targeting deliveries of 670 planes for the year. Commercial aircraft deliveries are tied to revenues and are closely monitored as a sign of financial strength. Boeing’s most popular plane, the single-aisle 737, comprised about two-thirds of the deliveries and an even higher percentage of the orders. The company last week announced a new order for 75 of the 737s, worth $8.25bn, from General Electric’s aircraft leasing arm. However, deliveries of the famous 747 jumbo jets fell by half to just nine. The company announced in January 2016 it was cutting production of the planes in half due to weak demand in the cargo market. Airbus has also faired badly with its jumbo offering, the A380. Boeing said in December it also was cutting production of its wide-body 777 planes to five from seven due to slackening demand. It delivered 99 of the planes in 2016, up one from the prior year. * AFP business@thenational.ae Follow The National’s Business section on Twitter Pages: Add your comment View all comments More Aviation Embraer on flight path to strong fourth-quarter results Emirates passengers given option to pay for access to premium lounges Lockheed assures Trump it will cut F-35 fighter jet costs Air France-KLM chief sees storm clouds ahead for airline MOST VIEWED Business | All Emirates passengers given option to pay for access to premium lounges Are tourists or visitors allowed to drive Dubai-registered cars?

News Sports Entertainment Life Obituaries E-Edition Cars Jobs Homes Classifieds log in Site Archive Exclusive: Rockford airport courts Norwegian Air for European flights Saturday Jan 7, 2017 at 8:00 AM Jan 7, 2017 at 11:03 PM Isaac Guerrero Staff writer @isaac_rrs ROCKFORD — Call it a first date with potential: fast-growing, low-cost Norwegian Air flew its first charter flight Friday from Chicago Rockford International Airport to Cancun. Airport officials have courted the Oslo-based airline for three years and hope its executives will choose Rockford as part of its aggressive plan to expand trans-Atlantic routes. Norwegian Air is under contract to operate Apple Vacation charter flights through the end of April from Rockford to Cancun, Mexico; Montego Bay, Jamaica; and Punta Cana in the Dominican Republic. The company's bigger play will happen this summer. It has promised to increase its own flights between London and several U.S. destinations, including Orlando and Fort Lauderdale, Florida; Los Angeles; New York City; and Oakland-San Francisco, California. The company also plans to expand its presence in the Midwest, though it hasn't said where or when it will do so. Worried that Norwegian Air's low-cost business model would stiffen competition, the U.S. airlines and aviation labor unions on both sides of the Atlantic for three years protested the company's bid for a foreign air carrier permit that would pave the way for its U.S. expansion. The federal permit for Norwegian Air's Ireland-based subsidiary was approved late last year. The company is spending significant sums to update its fleet with new, modern aircraft like Boeing's 737 MAX and 787 Dreamliner. And because fuel is typically an airline's biggest expense, Norwegian Air believes its lighter, gas-sipping planes will allow it to offer the type of low-priced fares that it teased in late December: tickets for summer 2017 flights as low as 56 pounds — that's $69 — from London to New York. The modern planes that Norwegian Air is buying feature wider aisles, more comfortable seating and wireless internet service; Norwegian Air offers free Wi-Fi on most of its flights in Europe and on flights between the U.S. and Caribbean. All of that bodes well as the company is poised to make a big push for the U.S. leisure travel market, said J.T. Bjorge, a base captain who has flown for Norwegian Air for 10 years. Bjorge was at the Rockford airport Friday to oversee the company's inaugural RFD charter flight for Apple Vacations. “One of the questions we have always asked is why is the cost from New York to London (is) three to four times what it is to fly from New York to Los Angeles? Because it's not three to four times the distance,” he said. “It's because there's a monopoly. “The biggest expense today for an airline is fuel, and it's expensive to be poor. What you want to have is new fleets and modern airplanes that are fuel efficient so you can compete.” Rockford's airport is a good match for a low-cost trans-Atlantic carrier like Norwegian Air, said Ken Ryan, the airport's director of business development and cargo. The airport has runways long and wide enough to accommodate any aircraft. And looming nearly 10-stories above the airport's midfield is a new, $40 million maintenance, repair and overhaul facility with two bays, each large enough to accommodate the biggest wide-body aircraft that flies today — exactly the kind of planes that Norwegian Air is adding to its fleet. Wood Dale-based AAR Corp. is operating the airport's jet repair hub and is on the hunt for customers. CEO David Storch told the Rockford Register Star in December that Norwegian Air is among his company's prospects. Storch was there when Airport Director Mike Dunn assembled a large local delegation that flew to Washington, D.C., in 2014 to meet Norwegian Air CEO Bjørn Kjos in U.S. Sen Dick Durbin's office in the Capitol. Dunn presented Kjos with the first-ever “Rockford Award.” The shiny, oblong trophy was meant to thank the airline for buying Boeing planes and thus supporting the Rockford region's aerospace cluster, an important link in Boeing's supply chain. The courtship continues, Ryan said. The airport has long marketed itself as a hassle-free alternative to Chicago's busy O'Hare International Airport. Free parking outside the passenger terminal, which is undergoing a $20 million expansion, doesn't hurt either, Ryan said. “From a strategic point of view, our airport works well for exactly the type of low-cost international airliner that is Norwegian Air,” Ryan said. “When you look at the type of trans-Atlantic fares that they are talking about, we feel there's no doubt that a large number of people would drive many, many miles to Rockford to take advantage of that pricing.” Isaac Guerrero: 815-987-1361; iguerrero@rrstar.com; @isaac_rrs Norwegian Air Norwegian is the world’s sixth largest low-cost airline and carried 30 million passengers in 2016. The Oslo-based company employs 6,000 people and operates 450 routes, including 40 nonstop routes from the U.S. to London, Paris, Scandinavia and the Caribbean. Norwegian has a fleet of 120 aircraft, with an average age of 3.6 years, making it one of the world’s youngest fleets. The company was named the World’s Best Low-Cost Long-Haul Airline by SkyTrax World Airline Awards in 2015 and 2016. Norwegian Air flew almost 30 million passengers in 2016, 3.6 million more than the previous year. Also last year, the company took delivery of 21 new aircraft and launched 34 additional routes, mainly in the U.S., Spain and the United Kingdom.

A day after announcing its ticket prices at par with AC II of Rajdhani trains, National carrier Air India today came out with another lucrative offer for its passengers allowing enhanced free check-in baggage on its jumbo 747 flights operating on the trunk Delhi-Mumbai route. Besides, the carrier also announced heavily discounted fares, starting at Rs 15,000 for travel in first class of its Queen of the Skies (Boeing 747) flights to the two cities till January 15, a release said. The revised check-in baggage limit is effective from tomorrow, it said. Air India had commenced the 423 seater Boeing 747 services between New Delhi and Mumbai early last month.

The transaction, which would more than double SpiceJet’s 49-plane fleet, may be closed within weeks after lengthy talks that pitted Boeing against rival Airbus Group SE, people with direct knowledge of the decision said. The deal includes firm orders for at least 50 of Boeing’s 737 Max, and renegotiated terms for 42 of the single-aisle jets that SpiceJet originally ordered in 2014, said the people. The 92 Max jets would be valued at about $10.1 billion at current list prices, before the discounts that are customary for large purchases. The order would be a record for SpiceJet, which was forced to shut down operations for a day two years ago after it ran out of money, prompting co-founder Ajay Singh to bail out the low-cost carrier. The airline may boost the total if final talks yield bigger discounts and favorable maintenance contracts, one of the people said. Boeing would gain a stronger toehold in India, where Airbus dominates narrow-body fleets after a string of order victories. IndiGo, Go Airlines India and the local unit of AirAsia all fly variants of the Airbus A320. “We expect to complete these negotiations and place the order this financial year,” the airline said in an emailed statement. A Boeing spokesman declined to comment. The order would help SpiceJet, India’s second-biggest budget carrier, compete with market leader IndiGo, which has ordered hundreds of Airbus jets to tap surging air-travel demand from a fast-growing middle class.

Boeing's deliveries, orders fell in 2016 Money Friday 6 January 2017 - 10:47pm FILE: Boeing's most popular plane, the single-aisle 737, comprised about two-thirds of the deliveries and an even higher percentage of the orders. Photo: Wikimedia Commons NEW YORK - Boeing said Friday its deliveries of commercial planes fell modestly in 2016 and it saw fewer orders compared to 2015. The US aerospace giant delivered 748 planes last year, down from 762 in 2015.  Boeing booked orders for 668 planes, down 13 percent in from orders in 2015. The 2016 orders are worth R1.2 trillion at list prices, it said. Boeing's archrival Airbus said in November that it was targeting deliveries of 670 planes for the year. Commercial airplane deliveries are tied to revenues and are closely monitored as a sign of financial strength. Boeing's most popular plane, the single-aisle 737, comprised about two-thirds of the deliveries and an even higher percentage of the orders.  The company on Wednesday announced a new order for 75 of the 737s, worth $8.25 billion, from General Electric's airplane leasing arm. However, deliveries of the iconic 747 jumbo jets fell by half to just nine. The company announced in January 2016 it was cutting production of the planes in half due to weak demand in the cargo market. Airbus has also faired badly with its jumbo offering, the A380. Boeing said in December it also was cutting production of its wide-body 777 planes to five from seven due to slackening demand. It delivered 99 of the planes in 2016, up one from the prior year. Shares of Boeing rose 0.1 percent to $158.87 in afternoon trading. AFP Comment Now! Discussion Policy Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

Forbes,St. Louis Post-Dispatch Bob King, 87, talks about how he and his wife, Donamay, raised six kids in the small home they have lived in for more than 50 years in Kirkwood, Mo. next play/pause pre Waterloo Region Record By Jesse Bogan KIRKWOOD, Mo. — The day the boss man finally came for Bob King was July 22. That day started out as routine. King stuffed a low-sodium breakfast and lunch into a brown sack and nosed his 2011 Toyota Camry north on Lindbergh Boulevard all the way to Boeing. The stalwart employee found a parking space on the sprawling lot near the airport and ambled to the front door, cane in hand. Then he went down a long hall to the elevator, up a few floors, across another hallway and a few more stairs to Building No. 32, where he settled into a cubicle. King, 87, ran his blue eyes over spreadsheets and databases. In his latest gig as a systems engineer in Off-Boeing Programs, he kept track of the labyrinth of regulations and directions on how to install new wings on the A-10 Warthog used by the U.S. Air Force. In his seat that memorable day last summer, a manager — about the age of King's children — tapped him on the shoulder. His career, which spanned more than a half-century of aerospace innovation, was coming to an end. "I got caught in a RIF," said King, perturbed. "You know what that is?" King was part of a reduction in force at the $97 billion behemoth. All of a sudden, he had 60 days to prepare for retirement and pass along parting knowledge. There had been celebrations for him throughout his tenure, marking 40 years of service, 45 and 50. In September, after 53 years with Boeing, a cake-cutting marked his forced retirement. A layoff, even this late in life, stings. King was one of the oldest of 14,000 Boeing employees in the St. Louis area. Yet he still sounded a little bitter. Then he yielded. "God knew I was never going to retire and he said, 'I have news for you,'" said King, a devout member of Trinity Lutheran Church. "I'd have worked forever." And so King has come home to Kirkwood. He and his wife, Donamay, live in a ranch home with three bedrooms and one bath. They bought it in 1964 for $18,500 and raised six children there born within a span of seven years. While Bob chipped away at missiles and electronic equipment, Donamay ran the packed home on Cherry Street. "Some guys will do anything to get out of the house and get out of yard work," Donamay, finally coming out to talk, said laughing. "He's a workaholic with airplanes and other stuff. Nothing around here." They met as children in a rural area near Toledo, Ohio, where at times they grew up without running water. Sometimes he cut asparagus and picked tomatoes for Donamay's father, who had a vegetable and fruit business. "Maybe my dad was a little bit like my husband because my dad just worked and worked and worked. So did my mom," Donamay said. "Sometimes he was so tired, he'd be sitting there eating an apple and he'd fall asleep. He was a good guy." Bob King was valedictorian of his high school class of 18 students, according to a newspaper clip. He studied engineering at the University of Toledo and taught radar repair in the Marine Corps. Starting in the 1950s, he cut his teeth for a decade at Convair in San Diego by helping develop flight control systems for the F-102 Delta Dagger and F-106 Delta Dart. "Those were good days when I would go out and work on the aircraft and go down to production and teach them how to rig the flight control," he said. Upon moving to St. Louis in 1963 to work at McDonnell Aircraft, what would eventually become Boeing through a series of mergers, he developed the reputation of a tenacious analyzer. "I have excellent skills at seeing the big picture and the little details all at the same time and keeping it all in the proper perspective," he said. Tim Bartlett, director of Off-Boeing Programs, confirmed as much. King was recently one of 300 employees under Bartlett's wing. He said none of them, other than King, worked beyond their 60s. Bartlett said King was respected late in his career for his intelligence: "A lot of wisdom. A lot of history. He's also attuned to state-of-the-art systems." Bartlett, 47, shares the same birthday with his former employee. "Bob is definitely good at giving me feedback," he said. "I valued it at different times for sure." King previously held management positions and, as part of the corporate planning department, researched ways the company could diversify product lines and possibly get out of others. King's health eventually became an obstacle along his career path. He had a heart attack in 1989. A 2005 stroke limited use of his right arm. More recently, he's had a stent put in his left carotid artery. With congestive heart failure, fluid sometimes needs to be drained from his body. He's limited to consuming no more than 64 ounces of water per day. As part of his layoff package, he was paid one week's salary for every year he worked. Sounding disappointed again, he said Boeing capped the payout at 26 years of service. Not that he needs the extra money. The house and family car are paid for many times over. He said he wants to tutor math and stay involved in other projects. He said it's time to spend time at home with Donamay. "People ask me about Bob, and I say he's going to do what he's going to do," she said. "He probably says the same about me." They are getting to know each other again.

The US aerospace giant delivered 748 planes last year, down from 762 in 2015. Boeing booked orders for 668 planes, down 13 percent in from orders in 2015. The 2016 orders are worth $94.1 billion at list prices, it said. Boeing said it delivered 748 planes last year, down from 762 in 2015 and booked orders for 668 planes, down 13 percent in from orders in 2015 ©Saul Loeb (AFP/File) Boeing's archrival Airbus said in November that it was targeting deliveries of 670 planes for the year. Commercial airplane deliveries are tied to revenues and are closely monitored as a sign of financial strength. Boeing's most popular plane, the single-aisle 737, comprised about two-thirds of the deliveries and an even higher percentage of the orders. The company on Wednesday announced a new order for 75 of the 737s, worth $8.25 billion, from General Electric's airplane leasing arm. However, deliveries of the iconic 747 jumbo jets fell by half to just nine. The company announced in January 2016 it was cutting production of the planes in half due to weak demand in the cargo market. Airbus has also faired badly with its jumbo offering, the A380. Boeing said in December it also was cutting production of its wide-body 777 planes to five from seven due to slackening demand. It delivered 99 of the planes in 2016, up one from the prior year. Shares of Boeing rose 0.1 percent to $158.87 in afternoon trading. Share or comment on this article e-mail Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.

Boeing raked in 668 orders in 2016, down 13% from 2015. The full-year order tally, released Friday, fell from the 768 new orders it won in 2015. The new order totals fell for the second year in a row as airlines slowed new purchases after years of record buying. Boeing and Airbus are facing a challenging landscape for sales and are focusing their attention on delivering on their swollen order books. Boeing ended 2016 with more than 5,700 commercial aircraft on order. One key target missed by the aerospace and defense giant was its aim of winning new orders roughly equal its 2016 jetliner deliveries. The plane maker delivered 748 airliners in 2016, down slightly from its 2015 record of 762. Boeing attributed the expected drop in deliveries to producing some updated 737 Max jets and U.S. Air Force refueling tankers in 2016 that won't be delivered until this year and beyond. Nearly two-thirds of its deliveries last year were for single-aisle 737s, the workhorses of the global airline fleet. The aerospace giant added 278 new orders in its final update, including commitments for 186 airliners for unidentified buyers, a late rally that swelled its orders by nearly 50%, but still fell short of its target. Boeing's customers canceled 180 airplanes in 2016, up from 108 in 2015, a sign of increasing caution by jet buyers. Boeing's European rival, Airbus, will release its full year order and delivery tally on January 11. The Chicago-based company begins 2017 in an uncertain political landscape. President-elect Donald Trump has upended the certainty of Boeing's orders with its biggest single customer block, the airlines of China. And Republican majorities in the House and Senate have vowed to fight Boeing's 80 jet deal with Iran Air. Inside its factories, the aerospace giant begins a busy year. The company will begin introducing to airlines its updated 737 Max single aile jet, but will reduce output by 40% of its most profitable big airliner, the long-range 777. Boeing will also bring a new twin-aisle jet to its lineup this year, a 320-seat version of its 787 Dreamliner currently being assembled in South Carolina. It will also start early production of its new flagship 400-seat 777X airliner, which delivers in 2020. TM & © 2017 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

Deliveries were slightly down compared to 2015 because of a production rate cut for the 747 jumbo jet. Sales slumped compared to previous years as the airline industry faces a capacity glut. Share story By Dominic Gates Seattle Times aerospace reporter Boeing delivered 748 jets last year, 14 fewer than in 2015 but still enough to leave it well ahead of rival Airbus in 2016 production. However, overall sales for the year slumped despite a year-end rush that saw the company book 202 net orders in December, according to data released Friday. Boeing’s final 2016 tally was 668 net orders, exactly 100 fewer jets sold than in the previous year. In a message to employees Friday, the new chief executive of Boeing Commercial Airplanes, Kevin McAlister, also listed the successful achievement of a series of milestones during the year.

At list prices, the total value of Boeing’s 2016 net orders was $94 billion. According to market-pricing data from aircraft-valuation firm Avitas, the real value after standard sales discounts is estimated at about $44 billion. Because the sales total lags the delivery total, Boeing’s backlog of unfilled orders drops by 80, the first time it’s fallen in seven years. Airbus won’t release its corresponding order and delivery figures until next week, but at the end of November its deliveries lagged Boeing’s by more than 100 jets, so it clearly won’t match the U.S. plane maker’s output. Airbus has struggled this year to meet its planned deliveries, beset by issues with the supply of Pratt & Whitney engines for its new A320neo jets and also with shortages of seats and other cabin-interior parts. Of the planes Boeing delivered last year, 490 were the smaller 737 narrowbody jets assembled in Renton. Of the 258 larger widebody jets Boeing built, the Everett plant assembled 197, including 99 large 777 twin-engine jets, 13 mid-size 767s and 76 all-composite 787 Dreamliners. The slight dip in overall production compared to 2015 was largely due to the rate cut in the 747 jumbo-jet program. Boeing in 2016 delivered only nine 747s, exactly half the number delivered the previous year. Boeing’s assembly plant in North Charleston, S.C., built 61 Dreamliners, according to Uresh Sheth, who tracks 787 production on the All Things 787 blog. That means the South Carolina site is running at its full planned rate, building five 787s per month to Everett’s seven per month for a current total of 12 Dreamliners per month. Boeing had said it was considering going up to 14 Dreamliners per month toward the end of the decade, with seven jets built at each site, but lack of new sales now makes that unlikely. Indeed, several analysts, including Bainbridge Island-based industry observer Scott Hamilton, believe Boeing may have to drop the production rate back down to 10 Dreamliners per month. If that happens, it’s likely Boeing will balance production with five jets made at each assembly site — meaning that North Charleston maintains its current rate while Everett loses two jets per month. The 2017 outlook is gloomy for Everett production and also for projected sales. Boeing will cut 777 production in Everett this year in response to slow sales of the current model ahead of the debut of the replacement 777X. It will deliver nearly 30 fewer of the expensive big jets than last year. In contrast, Renton should see more work, with a planned rate hike on the 737 to 47 jets per month from the current 42 per month. Airplane sales in 2017 are expected to continue at a low level as the airline industry worldwide faces a capacity glut. Yet there will be important milestones for Boeing Commercial Airplanes in the year ahead. In his employee message, McAlister said he’s looking forward to the first 737 MAX delivery, the MAX 8 model, as well as the rollout and first flight of two new airplane models, the 737 MAX 9 and 787-10.

  Home U.K. News Sports U.S. Showbiz Australia Femail Health Science Money Video Travel Columnists Wires Home My Profile Logout Login Feedback DailyMail NEW ARTICLESHomeTop Share show ad Boeing's 2016 orders lowest since 2010, deliveries hit target By Reuters Published: 15:36 EST, 6 January 2017 | Updated: 15:36 EST, 6 January 2017 e-mail By Alwyn Scott SEATTLE, Jan 6 (Reuters) - Boeing Co fell 80 planes short of its goal for new orders in 2016, but likely clinched the title of world's biggest planemaker for another year. Boeing on Friday said it delivered 748 jetliners last year and booked net orders for 668 aircraft worth about $94 billion at list prices. Boeing had predicted orders would roughly match deliveries, which it forecast at between 745 and 750 planes. Boeing's delivery total likely means the Chicago-based aerospace and defense company beat European rival Airbus on output. Airbus has forecast at least 670 deliveries in 2016, and is due to reports totals on Wednesday. Investors watch orders and deliveries closely to gauge future aircraft production levels and revenue, since airlines make most of the payment when aircraft are delivered. Boeing shares were up about 0.1 percent at $158.86 in mid-day trading. Airlines have slowed their shopping for jets, especially large widebody models, causing Boeing's "book to bill" ratio of new sales to deliveries to fall to its lowest level since 2004. Even so, Boeing's orders fell less than expected, suggesting aggressive sales campaigns at year-end, analysts said. Airbus has a price advantage thanks to the strong U.S. dollar, putting pressure on Boeing's sales team. Looking to 2017, "it's going to be tough for Boeing not to get more aggressive on pricing," said Ken Herbert, an analyst at Canaccord Genuity. Boeing's deliveries also slowed as the company began building the new 737 MAX narrowbody at its factory in Renton, Washington. The first MAX planes take longer to assemble than older 737 models, and cannot be delivered until Boeing finishes flight tests and gets government certification. Even so, Boeing delivered two more 737s in the latest quarter than in the same quarter of 2015. "That says something about the production system," said Howard Rubel, analyst at Jefferies. OUTPUT RISING AS SALES SLOW Deliveries likely will rise this year as MAX planes that welled up in inventory are delivered. But the gain will be tempered by a 40 percent cut in production of 777 widebodies. Analysts expect 777 deliveries will fall to 3.5 a month in 2018, from 8.3 currently, as the successor 777X model enters production. "What we'll be interested to hear is whether (Airbus and Boeing) expect orders to continue to decline in 2017 at the same time that they are raising production," said Rob Stallard, analyst at Vertical Research Partners. The forecasts are typically released with fourth-quarter results. The final days of 2016 marked a busy time for Boeing's new sales chief Ihssane Mounir. The sales force booked 198 net new orders since Dec. 20, including 189 orders from unidentified customers. The tally did not include any of its pending orders for Iran, the company said. The total included 194 orders worth about $21 billion at list prices for Boeing's 737 MAX. It also included an order for four 787 Dreamliners from Uzbekistan Airways. Boeing had already disclosed a large part of the tally earlier in the week, when it said it booked 80 orders for its 737 MAX. The new tally lifts Boeing's total backlog to 5,715 commercial jets, equivalent to about seven years of production, the majority of which are 737 planes. Sales of more expensive widebodies such as the 777 and 787 remain sluggish.

The transaction, which would more than double SpiceJet’s 49-plane fleet, may be closed within weeks after lengthy talks that pitted Boeing against rival Airbus Group SE, people with direct knowledge of the decision said. The deal includes firm orders for at least 50 of Boeing’s 737 Max, and renegotiated terms for 42 of the single-aisle jets that SpiceJet originally ordered in 2014, said the people, who asked not be identified because the discussions are private. The 92 Max jets would be valued at about $10.1 billion (Dh37 billion) at current list prices, before the discounts that are customary for large purchases. The order would be a record for SpiceJet, which was forced to shut down operations for a day two years ago after it ran out of money, prompting co-founder Ajay Singh to bail out the low-cost carrier. The airline may boost the total if final talks yield bigger discounts and favourable maintenance contracts, one of the people said. Boeing would gain a stronger toehold in India, where Airbus dominates narrow-body fleets after a string of order victories. IndiGo, Go Airlines India Pvt. and the local unit of AirAsia Bhd. all fly variants of the Airbus A320. “We expect to complete these negotiations and place the order this financial year,” the airline said in an emailed statement. A Boeing spokesman declined to comment. Crucial market The order would help SpiceJet, India’s second-biggest budget carrier, compete with market leader IndiGo, which has ordered hundreds of Airbus jets to tap surging air-travel demand from a fast-growing middle class. While IndiGo controls about 42 per cent of a market that has seen local carriers almost double to 11 in the past four years, SpiceJet’s share is about 13 per cent. SpiceJet shares closed up 0.63 per cent at 63.55 rupees in Mumbai on Friday, after jumping to their the highest intraday level since November 30. Boeing shares were little changed at $158.71 in New York on Thursday. India is crucial for Boeing and Airbus, and both offered aggressive discounts to SpiceJet, Bloomberg News reported in July. Boeing, whose jets dominate the current SpiceJet fleet, has the advantage of close financial ties. As the carrier’s financial condition worsened, Boeing provided assistance with payments to help it cope with the situation. That earlier deal, which is still on the manufacturer’s books, will now become a part of the new order, the people said. SpiceJet operates a fleet of 32 Boeing 737 jets and 17 Bombardier Q400 turboprops, according to the company. IndiGo, operated by InterGlobe Aviation Ltd., in 2015 ordered 250 Airbus A320neo jets. That order followed a 2006 deal for 100 A320 planes, and 180 A320neos ordered in 2011. IndiGo has 126 jets in its fleet. The South Asian country has been among some of the toughest markets for airlines, with some carriers failing due to fuel taxes, tariffs and low fares. As many as 17 airlines in India have shut down in the past two decades, according to consulting company KPMG and the Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry of India. Indian Airlines posted a combined profit of $122 million in the year through March 31, 2016, the first time in a decade, according to CAPA Centre for Aviation. However, the industry is set to post losses for two more years hurt by excess capacity and low fares, CAPA said in a report in December.

See related  Donald Trump's most outrageous quotes Melania Trump: 15 things you didn't know about Donald's wife How did Donald Trump win the presidency? He told a press conference yesterday that he was handing control of the vast Trump Organization to his two sons, Eric and Donald Jr. He said that the company would not make any new foreign deals during his presidency. The measures were immediately criticised by Walter Shaub, the director of the US Office of Government Ethics, who said they would leave the president vulnerable to "suspicions of corruption", says the New York Times. He added that Trump should sell his company and place the assets in a blind trust run by a truly independent trustee approved by the ethics office, not a family member.  "His sons are still running the businesses, and, of course, he knows what he owns." Shaub was appointed by Barack Obama, but also served during the presidency of his Republican predecessor George W Bush. The ethics office "sets standards for 2.7 million employees in the White House and more than 130 executive branch agencies". "No modern president has entered the White House with such a complicated array of holdings," says the Times. According to Shaub, "every modern president has taken the strong medicine of divestiture". It's a very rare step for the ethics chief to comment publicly on a President-elect's plans. The Guardian says that Trump's team did not informed Shaub's office of his plans. The paper quoted Shaub as saying that he was "especially troubled" by plans to put liquid assets in a portfolio approved by ethics officials. "No one has ever talked to us about the idea, and there's no legal mechanism to do that," he said. Sheri Dillon, a lawyer for the Trump Organization, told the Times that many of the alternatives the ethics lawyers had advocated, such as selling off Trump's business assets entirely or putting them in a blind trust, were not practical. Responding to calls to put his assets in a blind trust, she said that Trump "can't unknow he owns Trump Tower, and the press will make sure that any new developments at the Trump Organization are well publicised". "In addition, Dillon said, the price of a sale of assets would draw scrutiny, and… Trump would still be owed royalties". Donald Trump has to 'grow up', Joe Biden says 6 January Joe Biden has publicly declared that Donald Trump needs to "grow up" as he criticised the president-elect's attacks on the US intelligence community.   In a damning interview on PBS NewsHour, the outgoing vice president told the businessman: "Grow up, Donald. Grow up. Time to be an adult. You're president. You've got to do something. Show us what you have." He added it was "worrisome" that Trump, who takes power in two weeks, was still questioning the intelligence agencies' "overwhelming consensus" that Russia deliberately meddled in the US presidential election by hacking Democratic computers.  "For a president not to have confidence in, not to be prepared to listen to, the myriad intelligence agencies, from defence intelligence to the CIA, is absolutely mindless," he said. "The idea that you may know more than the intelligence community knows - it's like saying, 'I know more about physics than my professor. I didn't read the book, I just know I know more.'" Biden also criticised Trump's vow to repeal the Obamacare healthcare plan, saying the future president, while a "good man", lacked knowledge of the system. This is not the first time he has rounded on the Republican; the pair often clashed during the election campaign, particularly after a tape emerged of Trump talking about groping women, which the vice president said was "a textbook definition of sexual assault. Biden also told PBS that he will pursue non-political activities, including working with universities on domestic and foreign policy issues, after leaving office this month. He has said previously that he regrets not running for the White House "every day", although he has not ruled out what would be a third tilt at the presidency in 2020.  In one of his last acts as vice president, Biden will today preside over a joint session of Congress to formally confirm Trump's presidency, the Daily Telegraph reports. Donald Trump: Why he is siding with Julian Assange against US intelligence community  5 January Donald Trump has set himself on a collision course with US intelligence services after publicly criticising senior officials and siding against them with WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange. The president-elect mocked the US intelligence agencies due to brief him on alleged Russian hacking of US political groups in a tweet on Wednesday. The "Intelligence" briefing on so-called "Russian hacking" was delayed until Friday, perhaps more time needed to build a case. Very strange! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 4, 2017 "It was his latest attack on a key body he will rely on as commander in chief," says CNN, and again put him at odds with the agencies' unanimous conclusion that Russia hacked Democratic groups and individuals to interfere in the US presidential election. Despite being elected in November, Trump is yet to meet the heads of US intelligence agencies, although he has repeatedly questioned their assessment of Russian cyber activity. In another sign of increasing tension between the intelligence community and the president-elect, Trump also tweeted his support for Assange after he told Fox News that Moscow was not the source for WikiLeaks's mass leak of emails from the Democrats. Both the FBI and CIA say the leaked information was intended to sway the presidential election in Trump's favour. However, Assange claimed a 14-year-old boy could have carried out one of the hacks and accused the Obama administration of attempting to "delegitimise" a Trump presidency by falsely tying Russia to the attack. Trump's support represents an astonishing change in fortunes for the Australian hacker, who was publically vilified by conservatives, including Fox News, when he leaked US military secrets and published classified diplomatic cables in 2010. However, while Trump appears to be on his side, Assange has continued to face criticism from other Republicans. House Speaker Paul Ryan called him a "a sycophant for Russia", later adding: "He leaks, he steals data and he compromises national security."  Senator Mark Warner, vice president of the US intelligence committee, also said the president-elect should have more "respect" for intelligence professionals. Trump has previously criticised the spy agencies for the faulty intelligence about Iraq's supposed possession of weapons of mass destruction before the US invasion in 2003. However, "to publicly embarrass some of the most senior intelligence officials in the country and question their motives is unprecedented for a president-elect or incumbent president", says The Independent. Donald Trump dismisses North Korean missile tests in tweet 3 January Donald Trump has shot down North Korea's claim that it is close to testing long-range missiles capable of targeting the United States. North Korean leader Kim Jong-un made the claim in his New Year message, saying the country was almost ready to test intercontinental ballistic missiles that could carry nuclear warheads. However, the US president-elect derided the suggesting, tweeting simply: "It won't happen!" North Korea just stated that it is in the final stages of developing a nuclear weapon capable of reaching parts of the U.S. It won't happen! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 2, 2017 Trump also took aim at China over the issue, writing: "China has been taking out massive amounts of money & wealth from the U.S. in totally one-sided trade, but won't help with North Korea. Nice!" See related  Donald Trump's most outrageous quotes Melania Trump: 15 things you didn't know about Donald's wife How did Donald Trump win the presidency? It is Trump's first comment on North Korea's nuclear plans since the US presidential election in November. Prior to that, he had said he might be prepared to have a burger with Kim. South Korea said Trump's message showed he understood the seriousness of the situation and could be interpreted as a "clear warning" to Pyongyang.    "President-elect Trump and US officials are clearly aware of the gravity and urgency of the North Korean nuclear threat," ministry spokesman Cho June-hyuck told a briefing, reports Reuters. "There are no ifs or buts in Mr Trump's tweet," the BBC says, adding that the message could mean the president-elect believes North Korea will not be able to finalise the technology or that he thinks the two countries could reach an agreement for it to terminate its nuclear programme. It could also imply Trump is considering military action, although experts, who calculate Pyongyang is less than five years from conducting successful tests, believe that would be ineffectual. Methods such as "bunker-busting" bombs would be unlikely to halt the programme, while cyber warfare or the assassination of top scientists would also be difficult. The US has dismissed North Korea's attempts to hold talks over the years, saying it must disarm first.

International Business Times, India Edition International Business Times, India Edition India US World Business Technology Sports Entertainment Auto Photos Video Search Search Home Companies Boeing strikes big deal with SpiceJet for 92 Boeing 737 jetliners: Report The SpiceJet-Boeing deal is pegged at $10.1 billion as per current list prices. Kalyani Pandey January 6, 2017 14:06 IST A SpiceJet Airlines aircraft at Bengaluru airport in March 2012.Reuters file SpiceJet, India's second-largest budget carrier is expected to place an order for 92 Boeing 737 jetliners. The carrier's new order is part of its rapid expansion plan in the world's fastest-growing aviation market.  The SpiceJet-Boeing deal includes at least 50 Boeing 737 Max and another 42 single-aisle jets, which the budget carrier had ordered two years ago. The deal value is pegged at $10.1 billion as per current list prices, Bloomberg reported. Also read: SpiceJet AGM to decide on Ajay Singh's salary, perks The latest order will take SpiceJet's fleet size up to 141 (which stands at 49 at present). The transaction is expected to be finalised over the next few weeks. A person aware of the development told the agency that the airline may boost the total number if the final talks result in bigger discounts and other favourable maintenance contracts.  The deal would increase Boeing's presence in the Indian aviation market, which so far is dominated by its rival Airbus. Domestic carriers like GoAir, IndiGo and AirAsia India operate variants of Airbus A320. "We expect to complete the negotiations and place the order this financial year," SpiceJet was quoted as saying by Bloomberg.  The Ajay Singh-founded airline's budget carrier rival IndiGo dominates the market and has a controlling market share of 42 per cent, whereas SpiceJet's market share remains around 13 per cent.  Flight makes emergency landing at Delhi airport In other news, a SpiceJet flight from Bengaluru made an emergency landing at Delhi's Indira Gandhi International Airport early on Friday (January 6) morning. The reason for the emergency landing was a partial hydraulic failure. All passengers and crew of flight SG136 were safe, the Indian Express reported.  The SpiceJet stock was trading at Rs 63.70 around 1:24 pm on Friday, up 0.87 per cent from its previous close on the Bombay Stock Exchange.  Related Air fares set to rise after jet fuel prices increase by 8% in the new year?

(Reuters/Amit Dave) Share Written by Manu Balachandran January 06, 2017 Quartz india Two years ago, India’s fourth-largest airline by market share, SpiceJet, was about to shut shop. The budget carrier had been making losses for three straight years and its creditors were lining up to recover dues. The company was even forced to ground its aircraft for a few days after retailers refused to supply fuel, citing past dues. But, the once-beleaguered airline has registered a remarkable turnaround since then. On Jan. 06, Bloomberg reported that SpiceJet is all set to order 92 jetliners from Boeing, worth $10.1 billion (Rs 68,000 crore). The deal includes an order of at least 50 new Boeing 737 Max airplanes—a narrow-bodied model— and renegotiated conditions for another 42 Boeing 737 jets that the company had ordered in 2014. “The airline may boost the total (order) if final talks yield bigger discounts and favorable maintenance contracts,” Bloomberg reported, quoting an unnamed source. “We expect to complete these negotiations and place the order this financial year,” SpiceJet told Bloomberg. SpiceJet’s decision to aggressively pursue new orders comes at a time when India’s airline companies are finally making profits after several years of gloom. In 2016, all three of India’s publicly-listed airlines—Jet Airways, IndiGo, and SpiceJet—recorded substantial profits. GoAir, a privately-held company, was also believed to have raked in over $20 million in profits during fiscal 2016, while Air India recorded operational profits for the first time in nine years. For SpiceJet, the turnaround was the result of many months spent recalibrating its strategy. “We stuck to the very basics of operating a low-cost carrier—a two-pronged strategy of reducing cost and maximising revenues,” a SpiceJet spokesperson had explained to Quartz in 2015. That year, SpiceJet had emerged as the world’s best performing airline stock after the company’s share price soared by 340%, the highest for any airline in the world for that period. SpiceJet isn’t the only Indian airline expanding its fleet. For instance, the country’s largest airline by market share, IndiGo, has finalised orders for 250 carriers from Airbus, and Air India, the government-controlled airline, is set to add 35 new jets to its fleet this year. Other domestic airlines, including Go Air and Vistara, are also lining up plans to increase their fleet sizes. “Last year represented a turnaround in the fortunes of India’s aviation industry after several very difficult years,” consultancy firm CAPA said in a statement. “Lower fuel prices combined with modest capacity growth and strengthening economic fundamentals were largely responsible for surging traffic and an improvement in airline financials in fiscal 2016. Domestic traffic was up 21.2%.” Read full story home our picks popular latest obsessions search

[https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6d/Pray_for_my_compatriots_on_Malaysia_Airlines_flight_MH370._%2813010243353%29.jpg] Close to two years and 10 months after the disappearance, the predicament offers more questions than answers. Here is a flight MH370 update. The Boeing 777 class aircraft belonging to the Malaysian Airlines went off grid without leaving any trace in March, 2014. Since its mysterious disappearance, efforts to unearth its status was underway. Not with much of success, of course. Rationally speaking, there’s no foul play here other than a crash and sink, prima facie. Sporadic flight MH370 update with the findings of flight debris gave some room for optimism too. Nothing substantial, however. Flight MH370 Update Latest developments have it that a private company could take over the search operations. Besides, Boeing might break the bank on the said search operation too. An authoritative figure spoke to the Popular Mechanics earlier to confirm the ongoing talks on change of search party. Australian Transfer Safety Bureau [ATSB], along with Malaysian and Chinese officials did their best to get to the bottom of the accident, but without much success. Turns out, the crux is the inability to locate the wreckage site precisely. Due to the vastness of the oceans and plethora of possibilities and hindrance, it’s indeed a gargantuan task. As this incident marks the second deadliest one involving a Boeing 777, the aviation giants are likely to take a keen interest.

China initially threw shade at Malaysia for its negligence in the wake of disappearance. Not to mention the loss incurred by the Malaysian government in the aftermath due to plummeting ticket sales. ATSB, on the other hand, will pull the plug on its operations once its contract expires in January.

Due to the total six debris found in the East African coast that are believed to be a part of MH370, optimism is at large. Giving the benefit of doubt to the latest flight MH370 update, it’s welcoming that Boeing is stepping up. A tad optimism and support is something the families can find comfort in.

REUTERS/Amit Dave/File Indian budget airline SpiceJet Ltd. is poised to order at least 92 Boeing Co. 737 jetliners as the carrier plots rapid expansion in the world’s fastest growing aerospace market. The transaction, which would more than double SpiceJet’s 40-plane fleet, may be closed within weeks after lengthy talks that pitted Boeing against rival Airbus Group SE, people with direct knowledge of the decision said. The deal includes firm orders for at least 50 of Boeing’s 737 Max, and renegotiated terms for 42 of the single-aisle jets that SpiceJet originally ordered in 2014, said the people, who asked not be identified because the discussions are private. The 92 Max jets would be valued at about $10.1 billion at current list prices, before the discounts that are customary for large purchases. The order would be a record for SpiceJet, which was forced to shut down operations for a day two years ago after it ran out of money. Current chairman and co-founder Ajay Singh bailed out the low-cost carrier. The airline may boost the total if final talks yield bigger discounts and favorable maintenance contracts, one person said. Boeing would gain a stronger toehold in India, where Airbus dominates narrow-body fleets after a string of order victories. IndiGo, Go Airlines India Pvt. and the local unit of AirAsia Bhd. all fly variants of the Airbus A320. “We expect to complete these negotiations and place the order this financial year,” the airline said in an e-mailed statement. A Boeing spokesman declined to comment. Crucial Market The order would help SpiceJet, India’s second-biggest budget carrier, compete with market leader IndiGo, which has ordered hundreds of Airbus jets to tap surging air-travel demand from a fast-growing middle class. While IndiGo controls about 42 percent of a market that has seen local carriers almost double to 11 in the past four years, SpiceJet’s share is about 13 percent. SpiceJet shares rose 4.6 percent on Thursday in Mumbai, paring past year’s losses to 23 percent. Boeing shares were little changed at $158.71 in New York. India is crucial for Boeing and Airbus, and both offered aggressive discounts to SpiceJet, Bloomberg News reported in July. For more on the Boeing-Airbus rivalry, click here Boeing, whose jets dominate the current SpiceJet fleet, has the advantage of close financial ties. As the carrier’s financial condition worsened, Boeing provided assistance with payments to help it cope with the situation. That earlier deal, which is still on the manufacturer’s books, will now become a part of the new order, the people said. SpiceJet operates a fleet of 26 Boeing 737 jets and 14 Bombardier Q400 turboprops, according to its website. IndiGo, operated by InterGlobe Aviation Ltd., in 2015 ordered 250 Airbus A320neo jets. That order followed a 2006 deal for 100 A320 planes, and 180 A320neos ordered in 2011. IndiGo has 126 jets in its fleet. India has been among some of the toughest markets for airlines, with some carriers failing due to fuel taxes, tariffs and low fares. As many as 17 airlines in India have shut down in the past two decades, according to consulting company KPMG and the Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry of India.

ChartsValuation & Peer ComparisonCommunity Buzz Close ✕ Indian budget airline SpiceJet Ltd is poised to order at least 92 Boeing Co 737 jetliners as the carrier plots rapid expansion in the world’s fastest growing aerospace market. The transaction, which would more than double SpiceJet's 49-plane fleet, may be closed within weeks after lengthy talks that pitted Boeing against rival Airbus Group SE, people with direct knowledge of the decision said. The deal includes firm orders for at least 50 of Boeing’s 737 Max, and renegotiated terms for 42 of the single-aisle jets that SpiceJet originally ordered in 2014, said the people, who asked not be identified because the discussions are private. The 92 Max jets would be valued at about $10.1 billion at current list prices, before the discounts that are customary for large purchases. The order would be a record for SpiceJet, which was forced to shut down operations for a day two years ago after it ran out of money. Current chairman and co-founder Ajay Singh bailed out the low-cost carrier. The airline may boost the total if final talks yield bigger discounts and favorable maintenance contracts, one person said. Boeing would gain a stronger toehold in India, where Airbus dominates narrow-body fleets after a string of order victories. IndiGo, Go Airlines India Pvt and the local unit of AirAsia Bhd all fly variants of the Airbus A320. "We expect to complete these negotiations and place the order this financial year," the airline said in an e-mailed statement. A Boeing spokesman declined to comment. Crucial Market The order would help SpiceJet, India's second-biggest budget carrier, compete with market leader IndiGo, which has ordered hundreds of Airbus jets to tap surging air-travel demand from a fast-growing middle class. While IndiGo controls about 42 percent of a market that has seen local carriers almost double to 11 in the past four years, SpiceJet’s share is about 13 percent. SpiceJet shares extended gains for a third day, rising 2.3 percent to 64.60 rupees as of 9:25 a.m. in Mumbai on Friday, the highest intraday level since Nov. 30. Boeing shares were little changed at $158.71 in New York on Thursday. India is crucial for Boeing and Airbus, and both offered aggressive discounts to SpiceJet, Bloomberg News reported in July. Boeing, whose jets dominate the current SpiceJet fleet, has the advantage of close financial ties. As the carrier’s financial condition worsened, Boeing provided assistance with payments to help it cope with the situation. That earlier deal, which is still on the manufacturer’s books, will now become a part of the new order, the people said. SpiceJet operates a fleet of 32 Boeing 737 jets and 17 Bombardier Q400 turboprops, according to the company. IndiGo, operated by InterGlobe Aviation Ltd., in 2015 ordered 250 Airbus A320neo jets. That order followed a 2006 deal for 100 A320 planes, and 180 A320neos ordered in 2011. IndiGo has 126 jets in its fleet. The South Asian country has been among some of the toughest markets for airlines, with some carriers failing due to fuel taxes, tariffs and low fares. As many as 17 airlines in India have shut down in the past two decades, according to consulting company KPMG and the Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry of India. Indian airlines posted a combined profit of $122 million in the year through March 31, 2016, the first time in a decade, according to CAPA Centre for Aviation. However, the industry is set to post losses for two more years hurt by excess capacity and low fares, CAPA said in a report in December.

Lion Group 2016 fleet analysis: slower growth following 737 cancellations & increased focus on FSCs CAPA > Aviation Analysis > Lion Group 2016 fleet analysis: slower growth following 737 cancellations & increased focus on FSCs 6-Jan-2017 Tweet © CAPA Lion Group significantly slowed its rate of expansion in 2016 and cancelled 21 Boeing 737 orders. The Indonesia-based airline group took 36 aircraft in 2016 compared to 57 aircraft in 2015, as the rate of 737 deliveries was slashed in half from an average of two per month to one per month. Most of the growth in 2016 was at Lion Group’s two full service airlines, Indonesia’s Batik Air and Malaysia’s Malindo Air. Malindo expanded its fleet by a staggering 15 aircraft, for a total of 42, making it one of the fastest-growing airlines in the world. Batik expanded its fleet by eight aircraft in 2016, for a total of 41. The rate of expansion slowed at all three of Lion Group’s low cost airlines – Lion Air, Thai Lion Air and the turboprop operator Wings Air. The fleet at the main Lion Air brand only expanded by three aircraft, while Wings added four turboprops. The group’s JV in Thailand added six aircraft, which was fewer aircraft than initially planned. Lion now has the largest fleet in Asia Pacific ex China The Lion Group ended 2016 with 272 aircraft – making it the largest airline group in Asia Pacific outside China, based on fleet size. Lion Group overtook the AirAsia/AirAsia X Group in 2015, when it added 57 aircraft for a total of 236. Lion Group overtook the Garuda Indonesia and Singapore Airlines groups in terms of fleet size in 2014, when its fleet expanded by 42 aircraft. See related report: Lion Group added 57 aircraft in 2015, overtaking AirAsia as SE Asia’s largest airline group fleet In late 2016 Lion Group overtook ANA Holdings, which currently has a fleet of 268 aircraft. It overtook the Japan Airlines Group, which currently has a fleet of 242 aircraft, in early 2016. While Lion continues to take delivery of aircraft at a rapid rate, the frequency of deliveries slowed significantly in 2016. The group took delivery of 36 aircraft in 2016, according to the CAPA Fleet Database. This represents the slowest rate of fleet expansion for Lion since 2013, when it took delivery of 33 aircraft and expanded its fleet by 22 aircraft (net of aircraft retirements). Lion did not phase out any aircraft in 2016 or in 2015. Lion Group cuts 737 delivery rate in half as 21 orders are cancelled The 36 deliveries in 2016 consisted of 14 A320s, 10 737-800s, three 737-900ERs and nine ATR 72-600s. The Airbus and ATR deliveries were broadly in line with Lion Group's initial fleet plan for 2016, whereas Boeing deliveries were significantly less than the original plan. Lion Group had initially planned to continue taking delivery of at least two 737s per month in 2016. The group ramped up its Boeing delivery rate to at least two aircraft per month in 2013 and maintained this rate in 2014 and 2015. Lion took delivery of 25 737s in 2015 and initially was expected to take a similar number of 737s in 2016. However, challenging market conditions prompted Lion to pursue a slowdown in deliveries. Lion has taken broadly one 737 per month since the beginning of 2016. In 2016 Lion was apparently able to negotiate a cancellation of 21 737s that were initially slated to be delivered in 2016 and 2017. As of the beginning of 2016 Lion had 44 737NGs remaining on order (a mix of 737-800s and 737-900s). Boeing currently only lists 10 outstanding 737NG orders for the Lion Group. Given the 13 deliveries but reduction in 34 orders, this indicates there were 21 cancellations. According to the CAPA Fleet Database, these cancellations were recorded in Sep-2016 and Oct-2016. The CAPA Fleet Database also shows that Lion Group converted 16 737-900ER orders to 737-800s in 2016, continuing a trend over the last few years in which it has opted mainly for the smaller -800 despite initially ordering the -900ER.

Lion Group is expected to take its last batch of 737NGs in 2017 while also starting to take delivery of the new generation 737 MAX. Lion ordered 201 737 MAX 9s in early 2012 and is planning to take its first 737 MAX 9 in 2Q2017. The decision to take 21 fewer 737NGs than initially planned is not surprising. The original delivery schedule proved to be overambitious, particularly in its home market of Indonesia where the group has been set back the past two years by unexpected regulatory constraints and challenging market conditions. Deciding to slow fleet growth at this juncture is also logical given that the 737 MAX, which offers improved efficiencies and range, is about to enter service. Lion is better off taking fewer 737s until the MAX arrives. Lion, it seems, was able to get off the hook on its final 21 737NG commitments without increasing its 737 MAX commitments. Boeing still lists Lion Group with 201 737 MAX 9 orders. There are also no apparent unidentified MAX orders that could have been placed by Lion in compensation for cancelling the 737NG orders. Therefore it appears the 21 aircraft were cancelled outright, rather than converted. Lion potentially had the right to cancel some of its 737NGs without penalty as part of its last order at Boeing. Lion ordered another 29 737-900ERs as part of the 2012 MAX order. Lion reduces A320ceo order but will likely take additional A330s in exchange Lion Group also reduced its A320ceo order book by another eight aircraft in 2016. The group ordered 60 A320ceos in 2013 as part of a blockbuster deal that also included 109 A320neos and 65 A321neos. This was the group’s first deal with Airbus. In 2015 Lion converted nine of its A320ceo orders to A320neos, lifting its A320neo commitments from 109 to 118 aircraft. Lion Group therefore began 2016 with 13 A320ceos and 38 more on order. Lion Group took 14 A320ceos in 2016 but currently only has commitments for another 16 A320ceos. This indicates that another eight A320ceos have been converted or cancelled. Airbus still lists Lion Group with 118 A320neo and 65 A321neo orders – an indication the eight A320ceos were not converted to A320neos. However, these eight aircraft were likely converted to A330-300s. Airbus has three unidentified A330-300 orders which were placed in Sep-2016 – the same month Lion reduced its A320ceo order by eight aircraft. Lion Group took three A330-300s in late 2015. Airbus currently does not list any additional A330 orders for Lion, but Lion is expected to take additional A330s in late 2017. Lion could be using deposits initially placed for A320ceos to expand its A330 fleet. Accelerated transition to A320neos is sensible Reducing A320ceo commitments is sensible as it enables the group to transition faster to new-generation A320neos. Lion Group is planning to start taking delivery of A320/A321neo aircraft in mid-2017. Lion Group began taking A320s in late 2014, with an initial delivery rate of one aircraft every two months. Approximately a year later, in late 2015, it accelerated its rate of A320 deliveries to broadly one aircraft, or slightly more than one aircraft, per month. So far Lion Group’s Indonesia-based full service airline subsidiary Batik Air has taken all of the group’s A320s. Batik is again earmarked to take all of Lion Group’s A320 family aircraft deliveries in 2017 – including a mix of ceos and neos. Lion prefers to focus on A320s at Batik while maintaining all-Boeing narrowbody fleets at Lion, Thai Lion and Malindo. Batik Air fleet expands by eight aircraft Batik also still operates 14 737s, but it has already reduced its 737 fleet by six aircraft and is expected to remove its remaining 737s by the end of 2018, becoming an all-Airbus operator. Batik expanded its fleet by eight aircraft in 2016 as the 14 A320 deliveries more than offset the removal of six 737-800s. However, Batik’s rate of expansion slowed compared to 2015, when it added an astonishing 15 aircraft. Batik commenced operations in 2013 with an initial fleet of six 737s, and added 12 aircraft in 2014. Batik Air fleet summary: as of 01-Jan-2017 vs 01-Jan-2016 vs 01-Jan-2015 and 01-Jan-2014 Aircraft 01-Jan-2017 01-Jan-2016 01-Jan-2015 01-Jan-2014 Airbus A320-200 27 13 6 0 Boeing 737-800 8 14 6 0 Boeing 737-900ER 6 6 6 6 TOTAL 41 33 18 6 Source: CAPA - Centre for Aviation. The slower expansion at Batik was driven by regulatory constraints and tough market conditions in Indonesia, which also impacted growth at Lion’s other two Indonesian subsidiaries. Batik is expected to reaccelerate growth in 2017 and start focusing on expanding its international network, which currently includes only one destination (Singapore). Lion Air added only three aircraft in 2016 Lion Group added 15 aircraft in Indonesia in 2017 – a modest figure given the huge size of Indonesia’s domestic market. Along with the eight additional aircraft at Batik, Lion Air expanded its fleet by three aircraft while Wings Air added four aircraft. Lion Air is the group’s original airline and remains by far the largest. However, Lion Air faced regulatory constraints in 2016 which prevented it from launching new routes for several months and registering additional aircraft. Market conditions in Indonesia were also challenging for most of 2015 and 2016. While Lion added seven aircraft in 2015, its passenger traffic declined slightly. Its passenger traffic was likely up only slightly in 2016, putting it very close to 2014 levels.

Lion strategically needs to regain market share at the budget end of the Indonesian market, which has been ceded over the past two years to the fast-growing Garuda Indonesia LCC subsidiary Citilink. While Lion Air will likely take delivery of more aircraft than it did in 2016, there is also an opportunity to boost capacity by improving utilisation levels which were reduced back in 2015 as market conditions became more challenging. Wings Air growth also slows significantly in 2017 Wings Air may also accelerate expansion in 2017 following a unusually slow 2016. Wings added 16 turboprops in 2015, but only four turboprops in 2016.

Lion slowed its rate of ATR deliveries compared to 2015, but this had been expected. Malindo accelerates expansion Malindo took five ATR 72-600s in 2016, picking up the slack as the group decided to slow the expansion at Wings. Malindo also took delivery of four 737-800s and inherited the six 737-800s that were removed by Batik.

As CAPA highlighted in a Nov-2016 analysis report, Malindo was initially only planning to add five or six aircraft in 2016. In 1Q2016 it accelerated expansion and decided to add 10 aircraft, which would have matched the figure from 2015, and decided on a further acceleration in 2Q2016. See related report: Malindo Air plans more rapid expansion in 2017 as it rebrands, and closes in on Malaysia Airlines The much faster than planned expansion was partially a response to relatively favourable conditions and opportunities in the Malaysia market. But it was also driven by Lion Group’s need to find alternative homes for aircraft that were initially intended for Indonesia but could not be delivered to Indonesia due to regulatory constraints. Malindo is planning more rapid fleet expansion in 2017 as it continues to pursue strategic expansion, despite intensifying competition in the Malaysian market. Thai Lion only added six aircraft in 2017 Thai Lion could also have been an outlet for aircraft initially intended for Indonesia, but Lion Group instead decided to slow its expansion in Thailand. Thai Lion added six aircraft in 2016 – three 737-800s and three 737-900ERs. In 2015 it added 10 aircraft, and the original fleet plan for 2016 was to add 10 aircraft again. Thai Lion initially adjusted its 2016 fleet plan in early 2016 from 10 to seven aircraft. Ultimately it fell one aircraft short of the revised target. Thai Lion Air fleet summary: as of 01-Jan-2017 vs 01-Jan-2016, 01-Jan-2015 and 01-Jan-2014 Aircraft 01-Jan-2017 01-Jan-2016 01-Jan-2015 01-Jan-2014 Boeing 737-800 8 5 0 0 Boeing 737-900ER 16 13 8 2 TOTAL 24 18 8 2 Source: CAPA – Centre for Aviation. The slowdown in expansion at Thai Lion, which launched services at the end of 2013, is likely an indication of challenging market conditions. Thailand’s domestic market – which Thai Lion focused on in its first two years of operations – has reached saturation. Thai Lion started to focus more on international expansion in 2016, but Thailand’s international market is extremely competitive and most regional routes are already oversupplied. The outlook in Thailand for 2017 is relatively bleak, and therefore Lion Group may refrain from reaccelerating expansion at Thai Lion. Lion Group focuses growth at the full service end In general overcapacity is a concern in Southeast Asia, particularly in the LCC sector. Given the current irrational level of competition between LCCs in the region it is not a surprise that Lion Group is focusing increasingly on the full service sector. Batik and Malindo are both full service airlines, providing two classes of service and offering the full package of frills in economy, including checked bags, seat assignments, seat-back inflight entertainment, meals and drinks. Malindo has also emerged as a network airline, relying heavily on transfer traffic and interlines with foreign full service airlines. Batik is likely to adapt a similar network and partnership model as it starts to expand internationally. At the same time as being full service airlines, Batik and Malindo have extremely low cost structures because they were developed by an LCC group that knows how to keep costs at an absolute minimum. Therefore Batik and Malindo are able to compete effectively against full service airlines, undercutting competitors without necessarily impacting profitability. There are still opportunities for Lion Group’s LCCs to expand. However, in 2016 the opportunities were better at the full service end of the market. By pursuing faster FSC growth Lion is also now a more balanced company. Lion currently has 31% of its fleet at FSCs – compared to 25% at the beginning of 2016 and 20% at the beginning of 2015. Lion will come back strong The relatively slow growth in 2016 at Lion’s LCCs – and the slower than typical growth at the overall group – is hardly surprising. The group’s rate of growth in prior years was staggering and it was not realistic to believe it could be maintained every year. The 36 aircraft deliveries in 2016 is still an impressive figure by almost any measure. No other airline group in Southeast Asia came close to adding that many aircraft in 2016, including AirAsia. The fact Lion has slowed down growth and cancelled some orders will be highlighted by sceptics as an indication that Asia’s largest airline group outside China (based on fleet size) is in a tailspin However, the reality is Lion has endured a difficult period, is still growing faster than virtually any airline group in the world and remains an extremely tough competitor.  Want more analysis like this?

Indonesia's Lion Group plans up to 10 new routes to Australia under the Batik Air brand by end-2018 11-Jan-2017 Lion Group is planning major expansion in Australia using its full service brand Batik Air. The group’s Australia operation could grow from one route currently to five routes by the end 2017, and potentially 10 routes by the end of 2018. Lion Group launched services to Australia in late 2015 when its Malaysian full service airline, Malindo Air, launched services from Kuala Lumpur to Perth. Malindo is planning to adopt the Batik Malaysia brand in 2017 and expand its Australia network. Meanwhile Indonesia’s Batik Air is preparing to launch services to Australia, initially with flights from Bali to Perth. The fast-growing Indonesian airline secured Australian Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) approval in late 2016 and could eventually serve several destinations in Australia from both Bali and Jakarta. Malindo Air Part 1: Lion Group Malaysian JV accelerates fleet expansion as Indonesia growth slows 16-Sep-2016 Malindo Air is pursuing rapid expansion as the Lion Group’s Malaysian joint venture embraces a full service network model. Malindo plans to add 13 or 14 aircraft in 2016 – making it one the fastest growing airlines in Asia and yet another thorn in the side of Malaysia Airlines. Malindo has added seven aircraft over the past four months, giving it an active fleet of 34 aircraft. Malindo is now in the process of putting into service two more aircraft, and expects to add another five to six aircraft by the end of 2016. This is Part 1 in a series of reports on Malindo. This part will focus on its plans for fleet expansion. Subsequent analyses will examine Malindo’s network expansion, its partnership strategy and its overall outlook. © 2017 CAPA Centre for Aviation :: Contact Us :: Terms & Conditions :: Cookies & Privacy Policy :: Glossary :: Feedback :: All times are in AEST (GMT +11)

The $10.1 billion transaction, which would more than double SpiceJet’s 49-plane fleet, may be closed within weeks, after lengthy talks that pitted Boeing against rival Airbus Group SE, people with direct knowledge of the decision said. The order would be a record for SpiceJet, which was forced to shut down operations for a day two years ago after it ran out of money, prompting co-founder Ajay Singh to bail out the low-cost carrier. The airline may boost the total order if final talks yield substantial discounts and favorable maintenance contracts, one of the people said. Boeing would expand its footprint in India, where Airbus dominates narrow-body fleets after a string of order victories. IndiGo, Go Airlines India Pvt. and the local unit of AirAsia Bhd. all fly variants of the Airbus A320. The deal includes firm orders for at least 50 of Boeing’s 737 Max, and renegotiated terms for 42 of the single-aisle jets that SpiceJet originally ordered in 2014, said the people, who asked not be identified because the discussions are private. The 92 Max jets would be valued at about $10.1 billion at current list prices, before the discounts that are customary for large purchases. “We expect to complete these negotiations and place the order this financial year,” the airline said in an e-mailed statement. A Boeing spokesman declined to comment. Crucial Market The order would help SpiceJet, India’s second-biggest budget carrier, compete with market leader IndiGo, which has ordered hundreds of Airbus jets to tap surging air-travel demand from a fast-growing middle class. While IndiGo controls about 42 percent of a market that has seen local carriers almost double to 11 in the past four years, SpiceJet’s share is about 13 percent. SpiceJet shares closed up 0.63 percent at 63.55 rupees in Mumbai on Friday, after jumping to their the highest intraday level since Nov. 30. Boeing shares rose less than 1 percent to $159 in New York premarket trading Friday. India is crucial for Boeing and Airbus, and both offered aggressive discounts to SpiceJet, Bloomberg News reported in July.

As the carrier’s financial condition worsened, Boeing provided assistance with payments to help it cope with the situation. That earlier deal, which is still on the manufacturer’s books, will now become a part of the new order, the people said. SpiceJet operates a fleet of 32 Boeing 737 jets and 17 Bombardier Q400 turboprops, according to the company. IndiGo, operated by InterGlobe Aviation Ltd., in 2015 ordered 250 Airbus A320neo jets. That order followed a 2006 deal for 100 A320 planes, and 180 A320neos ordered in 2011. IndiGo has 126 jets in its fleet. The South Asian country has been among some of the toughest markets for airlines, with some carriers failing due to fuel taxes, tariffs and low fares. As many as 17 airlines in India have shut down in the past two decades, according to consulting company KPMG and the Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry of India. Indian airlines posted a combined profit of $122 million in the year through March 31, 2016, the first time in a decade, according to CAPA Centre for Aviation. However, the industry is set to post losses for two more years hurt by excess capacity and low fares, CAPA said in a report in December. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

The American manufacturer previously said it hoped to sell as many commercial jets as it delivered in 2016, estimated to be above 700. But even after clinching two last-minute orders, a combined 80 737 MAX 8 aircrafts from GE Capital Aviation Services and Czech airline Travel Service that was announced Wednesday, Boeing's order tally is seen around 536. Ken Herbert, managing director and senior aerospace and defense analyst at Canaccord Genuity, expects a number in the 550-600 range. While it is below the one-to-one or the one book-to-bill guidance provided at the beginning of 2016, it's not a drastically low number that will spook investors, he explained, adding that 2016 saw good 787 order activity, but 777 orders were lower than expected. Both the 787 Dreamliner and the 777 are wide-body planes with high fuel efficiency levels and are typically used for long-haul flights. The 737 MAX meanwhile is a narrow-body jetliner that Boeing calls the fastest-selling airplane in the firm's history. Going forward, 777 orders are seen recovering. "Boeing just made an announcement about (777 production) rates going to 5 a month later in 2017. The real rate is closer to 3.5 a month, so this reflects the bottom of this plane. There's a backlog to support rates at around 4 a month so I'm not expecting any more bad news for 777s," Herbert said. He anticipates some new orders for the 737 MAX, but warned that the real focus will be on execution and delivery. "The real story for Boeing now is their ability to deliver on [production] rate increases and watch macro issues, such as currencies, that could negatively impact them, especially as they plan significant upward movement in 737 production numbers." Boeing is due to release financial results for the fourth quarter on Jan. 25. New York-listed shares ended flat on Thursday. —Follow CNBC International on Twitter and Facebook.

According to Reuters, customs spokesman Huang Songping said China is the biggest loser in the anti-globalization trend. He added it will be difficult for China's foreign trade to improve in 2017 due to rising costs and other factors. China is the world's largest trading nation. It could be heavily exposed to protectionist measures this year if Trump follows through on campaign pledges to brand it a currency manipulator and impose heavy tariffs on imports of Chinese goods.

The Wall Street Journal. 2:10 Legal experts: Trump's business plan falls short CNN Money 3:21 UP NEXT Hey, what about the Oreo? During the campaign, Mondelez International Inc., the owner of the iconic cookie brand, was one of the companies that President-elect Donald Trump railed against for sending jobs overseas, alongside the likes of Ford, Carrier and Boeing. But while those other three have already had post-election run-ins with Trump in one fashion or another -- triggering wild stock gyrations and corporate pledges to rework investment plans -- Mondelez curiously has not. Given the president-elect’s current tweeting pace, it feels like it’s just a matter of time before the company comes back under scrutiny. Mondelez wasn’t interested in discussing its game plan for when that moment comes, but experts said it undoubtedly has scrambled to prepare a rapid-fire response. “The last thing they want to do is have a brand out there being attacked,” said Richard Frisch, a crisis-communications consultant. “There’s no question they have a crisis plan in place.” The stakes are high. Last month, when Trump wrote on Twitter that the costs of the F-35 program were “out of control,” shares of defense manufacturer Lockheed Martin Corp. tanked, wiping out almost $2 billion in market share. “We’ve never had a president-elect who could move stocks at will,” said Richard Levick, founder of the communications firm that bears his name. “A Trump tweet rates among the top risks of the year.” ‘Never Eat’ When a company makes nice, on the other hand, it can be rewarded. Ford Motor Co.’s stock rose nearly 4 percent after it announced it was canceling a $1.6 billion Mexican expansion. Hope Hicks, a spokeswoman for Trump, didn’t respond to a request for comment. Mondelez first drew Trump’s ire back in August 2015, when he claimed that the company was eliminating 1,200 jobs in the U.S. as it moved Oreo production to Mexico. “I’ll never eat them again,” Trump vowed. His assertion wasn’t quite true. The global snack giant had decided to invest $130 million in an existing plant south of the border to upgrade cookie and cracker production, rather than putting the money into a factory in Chicago. The move eliminated approximately 600 positions. Stephen Colbert Democratic candidates Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton soon jumped on, too, and The Late Show’s Stephen Colbert mocked Trump’s vow not to eat Oreos by shoveling them into his mouth one night. But the controversy eventually faded into the background. Mondelez, which generates more than 70 percent of its revenue outside North America, said it has invested about $450 million in U.S. manufacturing facilities since 2012, when the company split from Kraft Foods. The company still produces Oreos, the world’s top-selling cookie, at three domestic facilities. “We continue to make investments where it makes sense and that includes the United States,” said Laurie Guzzinati, a spokeswoman for the Deerfield, Illinois-based snack maker. She said the company hasn’t heard from the incoming administration. Mondelez might be better positioned than, say, Boeing Co. or Ford, to resist the pressure of a Trump tweet. It isn’t a big government contractor -- making planes for the military, for instance -- and getting consumers to boycott a favorite snack is difficult. That could weaken Trump’s ability to have a lasting negative impact on the $26.5 billion company, according to Frisch. Still, that may be little comfort. Large food companies tend to be conservative, perpetually seeking to stay away from controversy, particularly of the political variety. And in this unprecedented atmosphere, where the next squabble with the federal government is seemingly just a click away, Mondelez executives are hoping to avoid the glare of Trump’s aggressive Twitter persona. “If you’re Mondelez,” said Tim Calkins, a marketing professor at Northwestern University’s Kellogg School of Management, “the last thing you want is to be a target of Donald Trump." ©2017 Bloomberg L.P.

Boeing’s first 737 MAX jet makes its way through the production line at the Renton assembly plant. Most of the orders that Boeing booked in 2016 were for 737 jets. (Boeing Photo) The Boeing Co. says it delivered 748 commercial jets last year and booked net orders for 668 aircraft, including a burst of 202 orders in December. As furious as that pace was, it didn’t quite match Boeing’s performance in 2015 or analysts’ year-end expectations for 2016. Nevertheless, the count seems likely to leave Boeing ahead of its European rival, Airbus, which is due to report its final 2016 figures next week. Boeing’s tally doesn’t include its multibillion-dollar sale to Iran, which is still contingent on financing, but it does take 180 canceled orders into account. The company said its order backlog remains at roughly seven years’ worth of production at current rates. Most of last year’s orders were for single-aisle 737 jets, which says as much about the softness in the market for wide-body planes as it does about the appeal of Boeing’s next-generation, fuel-efficient 737 MAX. That market softness, plus the drive to compete with Airbus, led Boeing Commercial Airplanes to reduce its workforce by about 8 percent in 2016, with more reductions to come in 2017. The sales trend suggests a cloudier outlook for operations in Everett, where Boeing’s wide-body jets are made, than for the plant in Renton where 737s are assembled. In November, Boeing named GE executive Kevin McAllister to become president and CEO of the commercial airplane division, transitioning into the post held by Ray Conner. Today, McAllister sent a message to employees recapping the past year and looking ahead to the next year’s challenges. Here’s the full text of the message: “Thanks to the efforts of the entire Commercial Airplanes team, we finished 2016 strong. In December alone we delivered 67 airplanes and won 202 net orders. Overall we delivered 748 airplanes and won 668 net orders for the year. “During the holiday break I had the chance to visit employees in Everett working to deliver 777s. It was truly inspiring to see firsthand the dedication and passion our employees have to get airplanes into the hands of our airline customers. I also want to send huge kudos to the Seattle Delivery Center team and the teams at our other sites for their outstanding performance in helping us meet our delivery commitments. “While orders and deliveries are a big part of the story, BCA achieved a number of key milestones in 2016, including the first flight of the 737 MAX, the beginning of final assembly on the new 787-10 Dreamliner, the opening of the 777X Composite Wing Center in Everett, the delivery of the 500th 787 Dreamliner and the debut of the 737 MAX at the Farnborough Airshow. “In addition to visiting several of our BCA sites in December, I’ve also been listening to our airline customers. Their expectations are very clear: They are depending on Commercial Airplanes to continue to execute on every part of our strategy to operate faster and more efficiently, remain steps ahead of the competition, provide superior value at a competitive price and deliver on our commitments. “This year we will focus on differentiating our value with our customers, delivering on our operational and financial commitments, and focusing on meeting our plan so we can continue to invest in new products, develop the team and build a strong One Boeing culture. We’re also looking forward to the first 737 MAX 8 delivery, as well as the rollout and first flight of both the 737 MAX 9 and 787-10. “Seeing BCA from the outside, as I have over many years, is impressive. Seeing BCA from the inside, up close as a new member of the team, is incredible. In the coming weeks and months I’ll continue to listen, learn and hopefully meet more of you as I travel around the company. I also look forward to continuing to work with Ray and seeking his advice and counsel as we face the challenges and opportunities 2017 will bring. “I’m excited to begin this year with you and to be part of this amazing team.” Finally, here’s the rundown on 2016 deliveries and orders by airplane type: 737s: 701 gross orders, 550 net orders, 490 deliveries, 4,452 unfilled orders. 747s: 18 gross orders, 17 net orders, 9 deliveries, 28 unfilled orders. 767s: 26 gross orders, 26 net orders, 13 deliveries, 93 unfilled orders. 777s: 23 gross orders, 17 net orders, 99 deliveries, 442 unfilled orders. 787s: 80 gross orders, 58 net orders, 137 deliveries, 700 unfilled orders. Total: 848 gross orders, 668 net orders, 748 deliveries, 5,715 unfilled orders.

No one was injured, but the incident again raises concerns about the possibility of collisions between commercial aircraft and drones—a topic that in the United States continues to rankle both the Federal Aviation Authority (FAA), who are adamant about public safety (and keeping control of the skies) and the enormously large drone hobbyist community, who are keen on flying their beloved robots in the sky the way they enjoy. The Linhas Aereas de Mocambique (LAM) jet was on a routine domestic flight from the capital Maputo, in the south, to Tete, in the Northwest near Malawi. As the aircraft approached the runway in Tete, the pilots reported hearing a loud bang on the front of the plane. According to the Aviation Herald, no abnormalities followed, so the crew—believing it to be a bird strike—continued to proceed with the landing. After the passenger jet was on the ground and its 80 passengers disembarked, authorities examined the damage and concluded that the crumpled side of the nose cone was in fact caused by a drone. The damaged Boeing aircraft is currently under repair and a replacement one was sent to Tete to perform the return flight to Maputo. What type of drone caused the damage, or who was piloting it is still unclear. Surprisingly, this is only the second recorded occurrence of a drone colliding with a passenger aircraft. The other happened in April 2016, when a British Airways Airbus A320 collided with a drone around Heathrow Airport in London as it was flying in from Geneva. As with the most recent incident in Mozambique, however, no was was hurt. Despite the lack of injuries and few collisions, there have been plenty of near-misses and airports across the U.S. regularly report incidents with drones flying in or around the port’s airspace. For example, in a five-month period from August 2015 to January 2016, the FAA received 582 reports of drones in what it considers to be dangerous flying areas. That is an average of 116 a month. Deep confusion has swirled around drone regulations for a number of years in the U.S. with the commercial drone and hobby pilots flying under little or heavy handed supervision, depending, and the FAA stalling to release a report of rules and regulations on the matter until just this past June. When a drone operator was charged for dangerous flying behavior, it was under the careless and reckless distinctions used for large scale aircraft.

Flight TM136 departed from Maputo at 1535 local time on Jan. 5 and was scheduled to arrive at Tete in north west Mozambique at 1715. There were 80 passengers and six crew members on board at the time of the incident. In a statement, LAM said the aircraft was on approach to Tete when the crew heard a loud noise, suggesting a collision with a foreign object. The aircraft landed normally; a follow-up ground inspection revealed that the aircraft’s nose had been damaged. Photographs posted to social media show several serious dents and tears to the right-hand side of the 737-700’s nose cone. There is no obvious bird debris on the aircraft and unconfirmed media reports suggest the aircraft could have collided with a drone, although this has not been substantiated by ATW. LAM reported the incident to the Mozambique authorities and the aircraft has since been grounded, causing some disruption to LAM’s operations. A Boeing spokesman said it far too early to give a comment, as too little information is currently available. Drone regulation has become a high-priority topic over recent months after several near misses with commercial aircraft in 2016.

The haul still lifted Boeing's backlog of jet deals to 5,715 planes, but the 668 orders fell short of the 748 deliveries the company booked in 2016, as it prepares to boost output of its best-selling 737 single-aisle jets. Rapid growth in air travel in Asia and the arrival of new more fuel-efficient jets, just as oil prices started to spike, fueled demand from airlines and leasing companies for planes from Boeing and rival Airbus SE. However, growth has cooled, particularly for larger twin-aisle jets used for international flights, leading both companies to trim production of these models. Boeing's final order tally, including 180 cancellations over the year, was 848. Many cancellations were customers switching to the new 737 Max model that is due to start operating later this year. While carriers such as Southwest Airlines Co. and Turkish Airlines have deferred some deliveries, Boeing executives have said such moves remain below their historical average. The company's share price used to be closely correlated to order activity but this has waned in recent years, supplanted by free cash flow used to fund new jet development and a huge share buyback program. Boeing spent more than $7 billion on buybacks last year and in December the company raised the authorization for future repurchases to $14 billion. Airlines pay the bulk of an aircraft's price on delivery, and Boeing shipped 748 planes last year compared with 762 in 2015. Deliveries of military jets and helicopters slipped to 185 last year from 186 in 2015. Boeing shares climbed 8% last year, and Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg has said he expects sales to be flat in 2016 while cash flow rises. Mr. Muilenburg has played down the significance of matching orders to deliveries, and in September warned the target usually unveiled with fourth quarter earnings each January would be tough to achieve. However, he pointed to the huge backlog of undelivered planes as well as ongoing sales campaigns that could slip into 2017. Boeing has yet to book an 80-plane contract completed with Iran Air in December, citing the need for further government approvals. Airbus plans to book a 100-plane deal with Iran Air in its 2016 tally, due to be released on Jan. 11. Analysts expect the European manufacturer to have secured orders for around 600 jets last year compared with 1,080 in 2015. While the big backlogs help counter the impact on investor sentiment from the dip in orders, it also focuses more attention on the fate of some big deals signed at the start of the boom. Low-cost carriers such as Indonesia's Lion Air and Malaysia-based AirAsia Berhad rank among the top 10 customers of Airbus and Boeing, and some analysts doubt they will take all of the hundreds of planes they've ordered as airline industry profits decline. Both manufacturers deliberately book more orders than they can produce, expecting some cancellations or deferrals. Such moves can actually help profits as bigger deals usually attract larger discounts, so parceling up smaller lots of aircraft to new customers eager to avoid a wait of several years for jets can enhance earnings. Boeing aims to boost profit margins to the midteens from around 10%, excluding one-off charges at present. It has cut staff and introduced more automated manufacturing to boost productivity, as well as branching into more profitable services work. Analysts remain doubtful it can reach the target -- which is shared by its defense arm -- by the end of the decade, in part because of the dip in orders and its intense competition with Airbus. The new 737 Max is central to Boeing's expansion plans, and unlike the 787 Dreamliner, its development has been relatively smooth. Norwegian Air Shuttle ASA expects to take its first planes in May, well ahead of Boeing's original target of delivering the initial planes by the third quarter. Southwest Airlines Co. also expects to receive the planes this year. Boeing is boosting monthly 737 output to 47 jets this year and plans to raise this to 52 and then 57 as it transitions to the Max model.

Jet2 has now ordered a further four Boeing 737-800NG jets at a cost of more than £300 million which is in addition to the 30 aircraft the airline ordered from Boeing earlier this year, bringing the total number to 34. So far, Jet2 has taken delivery of eight of those aircraft and the extra four is set to be delivered between August, 2018 and January, 2019. Jet2 has been expanding rapidly in recent years and has enjoyed good growth particularly at East Midlands Airport Steve Heapy, chief executive of Jet2.com and Jet2holidays, said: "This is the next exciting phase in our ongoing growth. These four new aircraft will further increase our fleet size, allowing us to offer even more flights and holidays to top European destinations. "We are now recognised as the UK's top airline and the expansion of our brand new fleet will further enhance the quality and award-winning experience our customers have come to expect." READ MORE: What are the most popular destinations for a New Year break from East Midlands Airport? Earlier this year, the firm, which employs around 300 people at East Midlands Airport, announced a number of new destinations for its 2017 schedule. The new routes are Almeria, Girona, Halkidiki, Naples, Split and Paris. It means that in the summer, Jet2, which flies to several destinations from the Castle Donington airport, will be increasing its number of routes from 29 to 34. In September, the airline confirmed that at least one of the new planes it had on order would be based at the airport. *Read more of today's top news stories here.

Trump in recent days has used Twitter to issue edicts to General Motors and Toyota about where to build their cars. He has claimed at least some credit for Ford’s turnabout on building another plant in Mexico and Sprint’s pledge to create or bring to America 5,000 jobs. General Motors is sending Mexican made model of Chevy Cruze to U.S. car dealers-tax free across border. Make in U.S.A.or pay big border tax!&mdash; Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 3, 2017 On Twitter, he also has gone after air conditioner maker Carrier, industrial parts maker Rexnord and aerospace giants Boeing and Lockheed Martin. The bully pulpit of the presidency historically comes with the White House, but some are questioning what they see as Trump’s early and capricious use of it. He has targeted specific companies and put boardrooms everywhere on notice: Trump’s watching and ready to call out malefactors as he sees them. “This is a very new way of governing,” said Diane Lim, a public policy economist at The Conference Board, who stressed she was not speaking for the business organization. “Presidents usually don’t govern one company at a time. That’s exactly why it’s a very confusing time for companies.” Yep, @JustinWolfers, Trump gives new, more literal meaning to the notion of POTUS having the &quot;bully pulpit&quot; https://t.co/XxgS15jHNE&mdash; Diane Lim (@economistmom) December 7, 2016 Yet some are impressed. “It’s extraordinary what Trump has been able to do, with the jawboning and potentially holding out the possibility of whatever presidential actions he may take,” said Marc Selverstone, chairman of the presidential recordings program at the University of Virginia’s Miller Center. “He’s able to move the needle without invoking the levers of formal power.” At any rate, Trump’s maneuvers are stirring unease even within the political right, which includes the conservative minds at Missouri’s Show-Me Institute, a free-market think tank. Patrick Ishmael, director of government accountability in the institute’s Kansas City office, said market forces and consumers should determine whether an enterprise succeeds or fails or decides where to locate. “We’re not for government getting involved and putting its thumb on the scale.” Trump’s public comments have focused on restoring manufacturing jobs within America’s borders, though some in labor harbor doubts about his sincerity in putting workers ahead of big business. So who falls into Trump’s Twitter sights next? What can they do about it? And what difference can 140 characters from @realDonaldTrump make? Historical precedent Prior presidents have used the bully pulpit against business and labor alike. The phrase itself came from President Theodore Roosevelt, noted for breaking up powerful American business trusts early in the 20th century. Roosevelt saw public office as a platform for advocacy and meant the word “bully” to mean outstanding or first-rate. “I suppose my critics will call that preaching, but I have got such a bully pulpit!” the nation’s 26th president declared. A generation later, Harry Truman battled to transition the economy from war to peace in 1946. Labor strikes by railway workers and coal miners, the president believed, most threatened the nation. After efforts to negotiate the disputes had failed, Truman assembled not the media but the Congress on May 25. He already had seized the railroads and asked lawmakers for authority to draft the striking workers into the Army so it could then run the railroads. It worked. In the 1946 equivalent of a news-breaking tweet, Truman received word midspeech that the railway strike had been settled, as he told members of Congress, “on terms proposed by the president.” In April 1962, President John F. Kennedy held a news conference to call out U.S. Steel and other domestic steelmakers. Their public sin was a $6-a-ton hike in steel prices as the nation’s economy recovered and crises brewed in Berlin and Southeast Asia. Privately, Kennedy believed he’d gotten commitments that they wouldn’t raise prices. Kennedy called the simultaneous price increases an “irresponsible defiance of the public interest” and said the executives showed a “ruthless disregard of their public responsibility.” U.S. Steel’s chairman Roger Blough struck back the next day at his own news event. The White House responded by leaking Kennedy’s comments that the steel executives were “sons of bitches,” though that remark was a cleaned up alternative to what the president actually called them, Selverstone said. He said the Kennedy administration took private steps to pressure the executives and companies, and they ultimately rolled back prices. In 1981, Ronald Reagan used his bully pulpit moment to make good on a threat against striking air traffic controllers. He had assembled the media to blast members of the PATCO union, or Professional Air Traffic Controllers Organization, and read aloud the oath he said each had taken not to strike against the U.S. government. Those who failed to report to work in the next 48 hours will have “forfeited their jobs,” Reagan said. Populist appeal Trump’s bully pulpit moments also feed his populist message. He wants people to cheer him on, and many do. Enough Michigan voters switched loyalties this year to support the Republican Trump, who during the campaign regularly blasted Ford’s plans to build a plant in Mexico. Four years earlier, Michigan voters sided with President Barack Obama over GOP nominee Mitt Romney, a native son who nevertheless attacked the Obama-supported bailout of the auto industry. Romney called it “crony capitalism on a grand scale.” Trump’s tactics also excite his supporters who desire a forceful leader able to make change without subjecting proposals to what he calls “the swamp” of Washington as usual. “Politics from the outside looks bad to people who are impatient with the many, many steps that need to be taken to get things done,” said Chris Crandall, a social and political psychologist at the University of Kansas. He added that Twitter is the “perfect” platform for Trump to pressure companies. “Trump lives in the now, and Twitter is all about now,” Crandall said. “And what he says can be discounted to some extent because it’s just Twitter.” Since the November election, public-opinion polls show an uptick in optimism about Trump’s potential to lift the economy. His emphasis on boosting U.S. manufacturing jobs falls in line with a survey released this month in which 48 percent of respondents said it was “very important” that Trump raise the topic in his inaugural speech on Jan. 20. The only issue that Americans ranked higher in the Politico/Morning Consult survey was the need for Trump to speak about “healing the nation.” Still, Trump’s pressure tactics — reflective of the bluntness he showcased in the reality TV series “The Apprentice” — defy how policymaking ought to be carried out in a democracy, with inclusion and careful deliberation, said professor Crandall: “He’s playing a dangerous game.” Labor members largely voted for Trump, but some leaders remain skeptical. “Donald Trump is a dealmaker” capable of helping the big businesses that his tweets deride, said Mike Louis, president of the Missouri AFL-CIO, which represents 183,000 active workers. “He’s for large corporations, and that’s reflected in the billionaire executives he’s picked for his Cabinet. They’re not worker-friendly people.” Other labor groups are withholding judgment on Trump’s support for workers until he takes action as president. “I think it’s too early to tell,” said Joe L. Hudson, political director for the St. Louis-Kansas City Carpenters Regional Council. Bully chill Even if his policies turn out to be good for the economy, Trump’s bully pulpit tweets have cast a chill over how he might treat individual businesses. Since the election, Trump has turned on aircraft maker Boeing over complaints that the next Air Force One was costing too much and threatened, “Cancel order!” Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!&mdash; Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 6, 2016 Trump challenged Lockheed Martin two weeks later for costs and overruns on a military jet, adding that he had “asked Boeing to price-out” a competing aircraft. Based on the tremendous cost and cost overruns of the Lockheed Martin F-35, I have asked Boeing to price-out a comparable F-18 Super Hornet!&mdash; Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 22, 2016 Trump also has publicly hailed Overland Park-based Sprint and its Tokyo billionaire chairman Masayoshi Son for their pledges to create thousands of jobs in the United States. Some have seen those commitments to the president-elect as a preamble to seeking a controversial merger with T-Mobile. facebook twitter email Share More Videos 1:45 Deep Background: Automated cars at CES 2017 Pause 3:16 After nearly 50 years in exile, former KC Black Panther leader Pete O'Neal speaks from Africa 0:41 Kansas trooper’s dashcam shows semitrailer losing control on I-70 3:35 KU coach Bill Self on win over Oklahoma State: 'I didn't think it was one of our better games' 15:59 Facebook Live highlights: Terez A.

Trump made the remarks with Masayoshi Son, chairman of Sprint and CEO of SoftBank G The Associated Press Others have questioned whether Trump meaningfully influenced Ford’s decision to change plans that he had criticized. Whether Trump’s hand or agenda made a difference in those decisions, his public involvement has shown business leaders that the rules have changed. Public policy economist Lim said that new uncertainty has caused businesses to delay big decisions. Some also are waiting to see how much of the president-elect’s economic agenda comes to fruition. Her advice to CEOs weighing decisions, especially involving jobs or non-U.S. production, is to be proactive instead of waiting for the next Trump tweet to land. Reach out and bring him into the announcement. It’s late advice for Japanese automaker Toyota, which became Trump’s target on Thursday. He tweeted that Toyota said it would build an assembly plant in Mexico to build Corollas for the U.S. market. General Motors is sending Mexican made model of Chevy Cruze to U.S. car dealers-tax free across border. Make in U.S.A.or pay big border tax!&mdash; Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 3, 2017 “NO WAY! Build plant in U.S. or pay big border tax,” Trump’s post said. The assembly plant in question, in Guanajuato, Mexico, was one that Toyota announced in 2015 for production starting in 2019. Who’s next? The impact Trump’s bully pulpit moments have, or any president’s can have, may depend largely on how critical a company’s decision is to its pocketbook. A decision to locate a manufacturing plant in Mexico or the United States often is a close call, said Chris Kuehl, an economist at Armada Corporate Intelligence in Kansas City, Kan. Labor, transportation, energy, taxes, personnel and other costs all weigh on the outcome. Ford’s decision to scrap plans to build in San Luis Potosí, Mexico, certainly reflected more than political pressure. It wanted to move production of the Focus out of Michigan to the new plant, but sales of the small car have slumped badly. It already had moved the Fusion family sedan production in Michigan to a Fusion plant in Hermosillo, Mexico. Ford said last week that it would also move the Focus to Hermosillo. Trump’s praise was for $700 million and 700 jobs Ford said it would bring to the Flat Rock, Mich., plant to build an electric SUV and a hybrid vehicle for commercial ride-hailing operations. Kuehl’s point is that presidential pressure, backed by the threat of a future tariff or other policy action, can make the difference in big-dollar decisions that play out over years. The negative publicity of being singled out for criticism can be bad for business. “If you change that equation a little bit,” Kuehl said, “that’s enough to tip the scales.” I am working hard, even on Thanksgiving, trying to get Carrier A.C. Company to stay in the U.S. (Indiana). MAKING PROGRESS - Will know soon!&mdash; Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 24, 2016 One risk for Trump is picking the wrong battle and confronting a corporate decision whose scales he can’t tip. Failure to follow through would weaken his influence. It also is risky for the president-elect to use a mostly punishment-based approach, rather than favoring a carrot over the stick. Carrier did win some economic incentives with its decision to stay, but repeated threats can carry backlash. “It may end up being a serious misstep by Trump. He’s not making any friends this way,” Kuehl said. Still, there are many potential candidates for future bully pulpit moments. Airlines may consider whether Trump would weigh in on a decision to buy aircraft from U.S.-based manufacturer Boeing or Airbus, the European company that already has a heavy presence at U.S. airports. Orders for smaller aircraft from Brazil’s Embraer or Bombardier in Canada similarly could draw Trump’s attention as both supply the U.S. market, at least partly, from production abroad. Trump’s promised infrastructure spending means ordering a lot of steel for construction projects. That could prompt presidential scrutiny of companies that import girders, rails or other elements for bridges, towers and the like. Kuehl said there’s even a case that Trump could hope to protect coal miners’ jobs by calling out utilities that aggressively pursue alternative energy sources. “It’s a brave new world,” Lim added.

Boeing on Friday said it delivered 748 jetliners last year and booked net orders for 668 aircraft worth about $94 billion at list prices. Boeing had predicted orders would roughly match deliveries, which it forecast at between 745 and 750 planes. Boeing's delivery total likely means the Chicago-based aerospace and defence company beat European rival Airbus (AIR.PA) on output. Airbus has forecast at least 670 deliveries in 2016, and is due to reports totals on Wednesday. Investors watch orders and deliveries closely to gauge future aircraft production levels and revenue, since airlines make most of the payment when aircraft are delivered. Boeing shares were up about 0.1 percent at $158.86 in mid-day trading. Airlines have slowed their shopping for jets, especially large widebody models, causing Boeing's "book to bill" ratio of new sales to deliveries to fall to its lowest level since 2004. Even so, Boeing's orders fell less than expected, suggesting aggressive sales campaigns at year-end, analysts said. Airbus has a price advantage thanks to the strong U.S. dollar, putting pressure on Boeing's sales team. Looking to 2017, "it's going to be tough for Boeing not to get more aggressive on pricing," said Ken Herbert, an analyst at Canaccord Genuity. Boeing's deliveries also slowed as the company began building the new 737 MAX narrowbody at its factory in Renton, Washington. The first MAX planes take longer to assemble than older 737 models, and cannot be delivered until Boeing finishes flight tests and gets government certification. Even so, Boeing delivered two more 737s in the latest quarter than in the same quarter of 2015. "That says something about the production system," said Howard Rubel, analyst at Jefferies.   OUTPUT RISING AS SALES SLOW Deliveries likely will rise this year as MAX planes that welled up in inventory are delivered. But the gain will be tempered by a 40 percent cut in production of 777 widebodies. Analysts expect 777 deliveries will fall to 3.5 a month in 2018, from 8.3 currently, as the successor 777X model enters production. "What we'll be interested to hear is whether (Airbus and Boeing) expect orders to continue to decline in 2017 at the same time that they are raising production," said Rob Stallard, analyst at Vertical Research Partners. The forecasts are typically released with fourth-quarter results. The final days of 2016 marked a busy time for Boeing's new sales chief Ihssane Mounir. The sales force booked 198 net new orders since Dec. 20, including 189 orders from unidentified customers. The tally did not include any of its pending orders for Iran, the company said. The total included 194 orders worth about $21 billion at list prices for Boeing's 737 MAX. It also included an order for four 787 Dreamliners from Uzbekistan Airways. Boeing had already disclosed a large part of the tally earlier in the week, when it said it booked 80 orders for its 737 MAX. The new tally lifts Boeing's total backlog to 5,715 commercial jets, equivalent to about seven years of production, the majority of which are 737 planes. Sales of more expensive widebodies such as the 777 and 787 remain sluggish.

Where, for instance, is my vision? Where are my dreams? Where, above all, is my house made out of the repurposed wings and tailfin of a Boeing 747 and nestling, in all its effortful whimsicality, in the Santa Monica mountains and providing me with sea views throughout? Said aeronautical pile belonged to Francie, a retired Mercedes-Benz dealer. It looked ridiculous – the Boeing’s wings sat atop a glass and concrete building and screamed: “Look at us! Are we cute enough to kiss or WHAT?” It also cost millions upon millions of dollars (which reminds me – where are my millions?) and required clearance by 17 authorities and the closing of five freeways and a highway patrol escort during construction. But Francie and her architect seem happy. Facebook Twitter Pinterest ‘It’s so lovely!’ … Caroline Quentin and Piers Taylor. Photograph: Jack Dwyer/BBC/Wall to Wall “Actor and passionate property developer” Caroline Quentin and architect Piers Taylor present. She does the feelings, he does the facts. Their conversation goes roughly like this: CQ (gazing round the wood-panelled/poured-concrete/rammed-earth house): “It’s beautiful!” PT (pointing up): “Sun comes in here. And here. It makes it light.” CQ: “It’s so lovely!” PT (pointing down): “This is a floor. Otherwise your feet would have nowhere to go, and that is what we would call Bad Architecture.” I enjoyed it very much. It’s moving wallpaper, basically. Beautiful homes merging perfectly with beautiful landscapes, put together by people with enough style, money and talent to do it properly. Grand Designs on a grander scale – and after the hard bit’s been done and the mess tidied away. I did enjoy Karen and Dave – who had his dream eco-friendly home built deep in the Arizona desert. He reminisced fondly outside with Piers about only having to replant three cacti while, inside, Karen told Caroline how close she came to killing him during the build. She has a look about her that suggests she is still rarely more than one cracked bathroom tile away from doing so. Home is where the willingness to endure your spouse is. If you’re lucky, you get a nice view while you do it.

Posted By: Nithya Nair Published: Saturday, January 7, 2017, 12:23 [IST] Subscribe to GoodReturns A day after announcing its ticket prices at par with AC II of Rajdhani trains, National carrier Air India came out with another lucrative offer for its passengers allowing enhanced free check-in baggage on its jumbo 747 flights operating on the trunk Delhi-Mumbai route. Besides, the carrier also announced heavily discounted fares, starting at Rs 15,000 for travel in first class of its Queen of the Skies (Boeing 747) flights to the two cities till January 15, a release said, PTI reports. After Rajdhani Fares, Air India Offers Enhanced Baggage The revised check-in baggage limit is effective from tomorrow, it said. Air India had commenced the 423 seater Boeing 747 services between New Delhi and Mumbai early last month. At present, Air India allows 25kg in economy class and 35kg in business class of free check-in baggage on its flights, which has now been increased to 40 kg and 50 kg, respectively, on Boeing 747 Delhi- Mumbai service, the airline said in the release. As against this, private carriers allow only 15 kg of free baggage to passengers across their domestic flights. "Following its successful decision to deploy the iconic Boeing 747 on Delhi-Mumbai route from December 13 last year, Air India will now allow up to 40kg and 50kg of free check-in baggage for both economy and business class passengers on these flights," it said. Air India is the only carrier to operate the 423 seater, four-engine jumbo jet B747, on this busiest route (Delhi-Mumbai) of the country, the release said adding the aircraft offers a premium value to passengers with the most private and exclusive accommodation in the sky with 12 First class seats on the upper deck of the aircraft, 26 seats in business, and the rest 385 in economy.

(NYSE: BA) reported Thursday morning that it delivered a total of 748 commercial jets in 2016, slightly above its delivery target of 740 to 745 commercial planes. Boeing delivered 185 commercial planes in the fourth quarter. Boeing’s book-to-bill ratio plummeted from 0.975 in 2015 to 0.893. Of the company’s 668 new orders in 2016, 353 are attributed to unidentified customers and appear not to include the 80 planes ordered by Iran Air. A recent order for 75 737s from General Electric Co.’s (NYSE: GE) GECAS is included. Here is a list of 2016 deliveries by family, along with a comparison to 2015 totals. Boeing delivered a record total of 762 new commercial planes in 2015. 737: 490 (down five year over year) 747: nine (down nine) 767: 13 (down three) 777: 99 (up one) 787: 137 (up two) Boeing arch-rival Airbus reports 2016 deliveries and orders next week. The company has projected deliveries of 670 for 2016 and had booked just 410 net new orders through the end of November. The European aircraft maker delivered 635 planes in 2015 and wrote 1,036 net new orders. Net new orders in 2014 totaled 1,456 for Airbus and 1,432 for Boeing. Boeing’s backlog at the end of December totaled 5,715 commercial jets. Because Boeing values its backlog as contract prices rather than list prices, we won’t have a value on the backlog until the company reports quarterly results later this month. At the end of December 2015, Boeing’s backlog totaled 5,795. Here’s Boeing’s current price list for its commercial jets. Deliveries of military aircraft were slightly better in 2016. New and remanufactured Apache AH-64 attack helicopter deliveries rose from 61 in 2015 to 65. F/A-18 deliveries dropped from 35 to 25, and F-15 deliveries rose from 12 to 15. Boeing delivered 50 new and renewed CH-47 Chinook helicopters in 2016, down from 57 in 2015. Boeing’s shares traded up about 0.5% in the noon hour Friday, at $159.44 in a 52-week range of $102.10 to $160.07. The stock’s consensus 12-month price target is $156.20.

A half-century after MLK's death is Baltimore less segregated? Yes and no. Business Money Baltimore-area investors and wealth managers talk strategy for 2017 J. David Wagner Karl Merton Ferron / Baltimore Sun J. David Wagner, manager of T. Rowe Price Group's Small-Cap Value Fund, was named 2016's top stock picker by Bloomberg News. J. David Wagner, manager of T. Rowe Price Group's Small-Cap Value Fund, was named 2016's top stock picker by Bloomberg News. (Karl Merton Ferron / Baltimore Sun) Sarah GantzContact ReporterThe Baltimore Sun After a tumultuous 2016, Baltimore-area investors and wealth managers say they're preaching diversity for 2017 Boeing's stock tumbled in December after President-elect Donald J. Trump questioned the cost of Air Force One. Markets plummeted overnight on news of his upset election win, then rallied to record-setting levels by the end of the year as investors took stock of his promises to cut regulation and taxes, and raise spending. Earlier this year, Britain's vote to leave the European Union similarly sent shock waves through financial markets. One of the most successful stock pickers in 2016 tuned it all out. T. Rowe Price Group's $9.4 billion Small-Cap Value Fund, managed by J. David Wagner, had a one-year return of just under 30 percent in 2016, beating the S&P 500 and Russell 2000 Index, which reported one-year returns of 12 percent and 21 percent, respectively. Wagner's strategy is straightforward: He bets on individual companies. Specifically, very small companies with strong books and low stock prices that are off Wall Street's radar and, as a result, undervalued. The 336 stocks in the fund are almost exclusively U.S. businesses in evergreen industries such as financial services, energy and health care that, even if they've had a rough year, will never go entirely out of style.

The company said it has expanded its U.S. workforce by more than 150,000 people in the last five years. "We're focused on our companies. We don't worry that much about Trump or whether the Fed is going to hike interest rates," said Wagner, a vice president at the Baltimore-based money manager who has overseen the small-cap fund since 2014. "We want to create a portfolio that can be ready for everything, objective and agnostic as events unfold." As investors and wealth managers in the Baltimore-area look ahead to 2017, they say geopolitical events and a new U.S. administration led by a businessman with no governing experience will continue to be leading factors influencing financial markets and shaping investment strategy. To navigate the new year, they'll apply lessons learned from 2016 and its success stories, like Wagner, to maintain a diverse portfolio, focus on the long-term outcome, and try to not freak out when something unexpected happens. Passive investing is no fad, financial experts say Sarah Gantz Passive investment strategies, which aim to match market benchmarks like the Standard & Poor's 500 rather than beating them, have been gaining popularity for years. Easier to manage, such funds typically charge lower fees, which explains part of their appeal to investors. But as the trend accelerates,... Passive investment strategies, which aim to match market benchmarks like the Standard & Poor's 500 rather than beating them, have been gaining popularity for years. Easier to manage, such funds typically charge lower fees, which explains part of their appeal to investors. But as the trend accelerates,... (Sarah Gantz) "It's not that we did anything different," Wagner said of the fund, which launched in 1988. "It's just our style came back into favor." When it comes to Trump's domestic policies, investors and analysts are watching whether he delivers on promises to cut taxes, increase infrastructure spending and relax banking regulations, all which could spur economic growth and influence investors, said Dale Horn, a senior vice president of wealth management for UBS who is based in Baltimore. Three areas that stand to benefit the most are financial services and banking, pharmaceuticals and technology, he said. Community banks have struggled under tougher regulations that followed the 2008 financial crisis and could begin to grow again under looser rules, Horn said. If the Republican-led Congress pays less attention to rising drug prices, as some expect, that could bode well for pharmaceutical companies. And Trump's plans to encourage the repatriation of money stashed in foreign countries by U.S. businesses, largely technology companies, could spur investments in and acquisitions of smaller tech firms, he said. Meanwhile, investors may have a more cautious outlook on global markets, as they wait to see what comes of Trump's campaign promises to renegotiate key international trade policies, his comments goading international leaders, and a perceived coziness with Russia. "Whether it's real or not, it's perception, and perception is reality in the markets," Horn said. "Whether he behaves in that manner or not, it's fear and it's a risk." Trump's election wasn't 2016's only market-moving event. Global events, most notably Britain's decision to leave the European Union, also rocked markets last year. Analysts say there are plenty more international events ahead, with German Chancellor Angela Merkel's term coming to an end and other shifts in European leadership, and China's rising economic and military power. Some of the uncertainty associated with such events is already priced into international markets, which are more accustomed to upheaval, said Paul Ehrlichman, a managing director and head of global value at ClearBridge Investments, a global investment manager owned by Baltimore-based money management firm Legg Mason. For example, he said, while it took a few months for the waves created by Brexit to settle, markets recovered in less than an hour after Italy's prime minister announced his resignation following a failed attempt to change the country's constitution, a sign foreign investors anticipate and accept higher rates of political turnover in some countries, he said. What's more, signs of growth in Europe, such as lower unemployment, job growth and a rise in manufacturing, provide some balance to the region's political uncertainty, and could make for a fruitful investment environment, Ehrlichman said. "Investors get paid for courage, not comfort," Ehrlichman said. "Uncertainty and opportunity go together, particularly uncertainty related to bad news. If you go into those places, that's where there's money to be made and Europe is one of those places where there's a lot of uncertainty." For Mark A. Johnson, an associate professor of finance at Loyola University Maryland, 2016 illustrated two investing values he tries to impart on his students: diversity and consistency. Johnson teaches students to invest over weeks or months, rather than in one lump sum. "One good workout isn't going to reach your goal," he said, "just as investing a lot of money all at once isn't necessarily going to get you to your goal." Betting exclusively on domestic or international growth, small or large companies, active or passive portfolios isn't a smart strategy, Johnson said. Everyone loses at some point, and diversity helps hedge against losses in one area. Passive investing, or a strategy that relies on funds that aim to mirror benchmark indexes rather that beat them and often have low fees, has been growing in popularity. But actively managed funds have been cutting their fees, and funds like Wagner's at T. Rowe that offer a unique strategy will be the ones that stand out, said Drew Cook, director of investment management for Berman McAleer, a Timonium wealth manager. "What he is showing is we're really going to go to two styles of investing — benchmarking and truly active," Cook said. With 336 stocks, Wagner's fund is invested in more companies than other small-cap funds at T. Rowe, a move the man identified by Bloomberg News as 2016's best stock picker said reduces the risk of investing in very small companies. To further spread the risk, no one company accounts for more than 1.3 percent of the fund's value. Wagner's fund isn't a core holding for Berman McAleer, but it's something Cook offers clients looking to add more risk to their portfolio. Cook, who manages $700 million in assets, likes that the fund is full of diamond-in-the-rough companies that, as he said, "most of us have never even heard of." Cook thinks T. Rowe's distance from Wall Street and Wagner's nose for sniffing out good off-the-radar companies gives the fund an edge on competitors. "He blazes his own trail and deviates from the benchmark," Cook said. At the same time, "that means in the future, there are going to be years he underperforms," Cook said, "and that's OK." sarah.gantz@baltsun.com Copyright © 2017, The Baltimore Sun, a Baltimore Sun Media Group publication | Place an Ad Europe Donald Trump European Union Angela Merkel 'Passive' investing is no thrill, but it beats the alternatives Index funds gain in popularity, posing challenges for Legg Mason, T.

Business News Home > Business > Business News < Back to SMG 45 Saturday, 7 January 2017 | MYT 8:10 AM Boeing's 2016 orders lowest since 2010, deliveries hit target SEATTLE: Boeing Co fell 80 planes short of its goal for new orders in 2016, but likely clinched the title of world's biggest planemaker for another year. Boeing on Friday said it delivered 748 jetliners last year and booked net orders for 668 aircraft worth about $94 billion at list prices. Boeing had predicted orders would roughly match deliveries, which it forecast at between 745 and 750 planes. Boeing's delivery total likely means the Chicago-based aerospace and defense company beat European rival Airbus on output. Airbus has forecast at least 670 deliveries in 2016, and is due to reports totals on Wednesday. Investors watch orders and deliveries closely to gauge future aircraft production levels and revenue, since airlines make most of the payment when aircraft are delivered. Boeing shares were up about 0.1 percent at $158.86 in mid-day trading. Airlines have slowed their shopping for jets, especially large widebody models, causing Boeing's "book to bill" ratio of new sales to deliveries to fall to its lowest level since 2004. Even so, Boeing's orders fell less than expected, suggesting aggressive sales campaigns at year-end, analysts said. Airbus has a price advantage thanks to the strong U.S. dollar, putting pressure on Boeing's sales team. Looking to 2017, "it's going to be tough for Boeing not to get more aggressive on pricing," said Ken Herbert, an analyst at Canaccord Genuity. Boeing's deliveries also slowed as the company began building the new 737 MAX narrowbody at its factory in Renton, Washington. The first MAX planes take longer to assemble than older 737 models, and cannot be delivered until Boeing finishes flight tests and gets government certification. Even so, Boeing delivered two more 737s in the latest quarter than in the same quarter of 2015. "That says something about the production system," said Howard Rubel, analyst at Jefferies. OUTPUT RISING AS SALES SLOW Deliveries likely will rise this year as MAX planes that welled up in inventory are delivered. But the gain will be tempered by a 40 percent cut in production of 777 widebodies. Analysts expect 777 deliveries will fall to 3.5 a month in 2018, from 8.3 currently, as the successor 777X model enters production. "What we'll be interested to hear is whether (Airbus and Boeing) expect orders to continue to decline in 2017 at the same time that they are raising production," said Rob Stallard, analyst at Vertical Research Partners. The forecasts are typically released with fourth-quarter results. The final days of 2016 marked a busy time for Boeing's new sales chief Ihssane Mounir. The sales force booked 198 net new orders since Dec. 20, including 189 orders from unidentified customers. The tally did not include any of its pending orders for Iran, the company said. The total included 194 orders worth about $21 billion at list prices for Boeing's 737 MAX. It also included an order for four 787 Dreamliners from Uzbekistan Airways. Boeing had already disclosed a large part of the tally earlier in the week, when it said it booked 80 orders for its 737 MAX. The new tally lifts Boeing's total backlog to 5,715 commercial jets, equivalent to about seven years of production, the majority of which are 737 planes. Sales of more expensive widebodies such as the 777 and 787 remain sluggish. - Reuters Tags / Keywords: Corporate News , Airlines You May Be Interested Boosting women's libido Glass discards now included in waste separation law Better rates via online forex services Paying high interest rates for personal loans Purple should be your favourite CNY colour Chinese herb Dang Shen helps to boost strength Others Also Read Goodies for readers Parents want to settle payment directly with loan shark Do we really need to fear China money?

Beijing is planning to step up scrutiny of U.S. companies in the event that Donald Trump flips from trash-talking the cost of presidential aircraft to taking punitive measures against Chinese exports to the U.S., people familiar with the matter told Bloomberg News Friday. That's particularly bad news for Boeing because its Chinese business is unusually vulnerable to retaliatory action from the government. The measures could include scaling back government purchases or alternatively, investigations by tax, antitrust or anti-dumping authorities, the people said. Fission Chips Boeing and Yum! Brands are the only non-tech U.S. companies getting more than $5 billion in annual revenue from China Source: Bloomberg data Note: Shows latest fiscal year revenues from China. Texas Instruments figure includes Hong Kong. Just eight U.S. companies earned more than $5 billion in revenue from China in their last fiscal year. Five of them are semiconductor and electronics companies whose products are central to China's high-tech manufacturing ambitions. One -- Apple Inc. -- is a consumer business whose demand is driven by public taste rather than government fiat, while Yum! Brands Inc. has already spun off its China arm into a separate business. Boeing is in a different (flying) boat. Its biggest customers in the country -- Air China Ltd., China Eastern Airlines Corp., and China Southern Airlines Co. -- are all state-controlled. Even private carriers such as Hainan Airlines Co. know better than to go against the will of the government by ordering aircraft from a company in Beijing's bad books, especially when Airbus SE is offering comparable aircraft. The Peripheral Kingdom China doesn't make up a particularly significant share of aircraft manufacturers' unfilled order books Source: Airbus and Boeing orders and delivery books, Gadfly calculations There's a catch, though. While Boeing counts highly in the ranks of Chinese revenue earned by U.S. businesses, China isn't such an important part of the planemaker's order book. The 292 undelivered aircraft ordered by Chinese airlines and lessors make up just 5.5 percent of Boeing's total outstanding orders -- and just 4.4 percent of the total at Airbus. Boeing's China orders as a percentage of total 5.5% India's SpiceJet Ltd. is close to finalizing an order for 92 Boeing 737s, people familiar with the matter told Anurag Kotoky and Julie Johnsson of Bloomberg News Friday, about a third the size of China Inc.'s entire outstanding order book. Looked at in those terms, China's aviation sector is only a bit more important to Boeing than its biggest customers Southwest Airlines Co. and Ryanair Holdings Plc, and significantly less important to Airbus than InterGlobe Aviation Ltd., known as IndiGo, and AirAsia Bhd. Other Fish in the Sea If China Inc. were a single company, it would still only reach major-customer status for the big plane-makers Source: Company order books Note: Air Lease, AerCap, GECAS, SMBC are lessors. All other customers are airlines. Shows only customers with at least 100 aircraft awaiting delivery from either Airbus or Boeing. That's somewhat cold comfort. China's domestic aviation market will still be the world's biggest within 20 years, according to Boeing's 2016-2035 market outlook, outstripping North America and Europe. The relatively slender nature of Chinese carriers' order books doesn't mean there's no demand pending. Rather, it's a sign that the country's airlines are holding fire until Commercial Aircraft Corp. of China Ltd., or Comac, starts producing its C919 in competition with the 737 and A320 in a few years. In that sense, the trade war Boeing needs to fear isn't just around the corner. It's already begun. This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners. That doesn't account for the different profitability of different aircraft models but it's a decent back-of-the-envelope figure.

This line of thought does hold some merit given the fact that the airplane maker is among a handful of U.S.-based companies with an annual revenue base of more than $5 billion from China. However, Gadfly's David Fickling made the case that China's business isn't all that important to Boeing as a whole. So Much More Than China According to Fickling, Chinese airliners as a whole account for 292 undelivered aircraft orders, which represents just 5.5 percent of Boeing's total outstanding orders. The same holds true for Boeing's largest competitor, Airbus, whose total outstanding orders from Chinese clients amount to just 4.4 percent of its worldwide outstanding orders. Put into perspective, just one client in India alone, SpiceJet Ltd., is close to finalizing a deal to order 92 of Boeing's 737s airplanes. This one order alone is about one third of the size of all outstanding Chinese orders. Bottom line, all the Chinese airlines combined is roughly equal in size to Southwest Airlines Co (NYSE: LUV) and Ryanair Holdings plc (ADR) (NASDAQ: RYAAY).

The transaction, which would more than double SpiceJet’s 49-plane fleet, may be closed within weeks after lengthy talks that pitted Boeing against rival Airbus Group SE, people with direct knowledge of the decision said. The deal includes firm orders for at least 50 of Boeing’s 737 Max, and renegotiated terms for 42 of the single-aisle jets that SpiceJet originally ordered in 2014, said the people, who asked not be identified. The 92 Max jets would be valued at about $10.1 billion at current list prices, before the discounts that are customary for large purchases. The order would be a record for SpiceJet, which was forced to shut down operations for a day two years ago after it ran out of money, prompting co-founder Ajay Singh to bail out the low-cost carrier. The airline may boost the total if final talks yield bigger discounts and favourable maintenance contracts, one of the people said. Boeing would gain a stronger toehold in India, where Airbus dominates narrow-body fleets, after a string of order victories. IndiGo, Go Airlines India  and the local unit of AirAsia Bhd all fly variants of the Airbus A320. “We expect to complete these negotiations and place the order this financial year,” the airline said in an e-mailed statement. A Boeing spokesman declined to comment. The order would help SpiceJet compete with market leader IndiGo, which has ordered hundreds of Airbus jets to tap surging air-travel demand from a fast-growing middle class. While IndiGo controls about 42 per cent of a market that has seen local carriers almost double to 11 in the past four years, SpiceJet’s share is about 13 per cent. SpiceJet shares closed up 0.63 percent at Rs 63.55 on Friday, after jumping to their the highest intra-day level since November 30. Boeing shares were little changed at $158.71 in New York on Thursday. India is crucial for Boeing and Airbus, and both offered aggressive discounts to SpiceJet, Bloomberg News reported in July.  Boeing, whose jets dominate the current SpiceJet fleet, has the advantage of close financial ties. As the carrier’s financial condition worsened, Boeing provided assistance with payments to help it cope with the situation. That earlier deal, which is still on the manufacturer’s books, will now become a part of the new order, the people said.

Posted 07 Jan 2017 00:05 Updated 07 Jan 2017 04:45 Invited guests for the world premiere of the Boeing 787 Dreamliner are reflected in the fuselage of the aircraft at the 787 assembly plant in Everett, Washington, July 8, 2007 REUTERS/Robert Sorbo/File Photo Enlarge Caption  Email More A A SEATTLE: Boeing Co fell 80 planes short of its goal for new orders in 2016, but likely clinched the title of world's biggest planemaker for another year. Boeing on Friday said it delivered 748 jetliners last year and booked net orders for 668 aircraft worth about US$94 billion at list prices. Boeing had predicted orders would roughly match deliveries, which it forecast at between 745 and 750 planes. Boeing's delivery total likely means the Chicago-based aerospace and defense company beat European rival Airbus on output. Airbus has forecast at least 670 deliveries in 2016, and is due to reports totals on Wednesday. Investors watch orders and deliveries closely to gauge future aircraft production levels and revenue, since airlines make most of the payment when aircraft are delivered. Boeing shares were up about 0.1 percent at US$158.86 in mid-day trading. Airlines have slowed their shopping for jets, especially large widebody models, causing Boeing's "book to bill" ratio of new sales to deliveries to fall to its lowest level since 2004. Even so, Boeing's orders fell less than expected, suggesting aggressive sales campaigns at year-end, analysts said. Airbus has a price advantage thanks to the strong U.S. dollar, putting pressure on Boeing's sales team. Looking to 2017, "it's going to be tough for Boeing not to get more aggressive on pricing," said Ken Herbert, an analyst at Canaccord Genuity. Boeing's deliveries also slowed as the company began building the new 737 MAX narrowbody at its factory in Renton, Washington. The first MAX planes take longer to assemble than older 737 models, and cannot be delivered until Boeing finishes flight tests and gets government certification. Even so, Boeing delivered two more 737s in the latest quarter than in the same quarter of 2015. "That says something about the production system," said Howard Rubel, analyst at Jefferies. OUTPUT RISING AS SALES SLOW Deliveries likely will rise this year as MAX planes that welled up in inventory are delivered. But the gain will be tempered by a 40 percent cut in production of 777 widebodies. Analysts expect 777 deliveries will fall to 3.5 a month in 2018, from 8.3 currently, as the successor 777X model enters production. "What we'll be interested to hear is whether (Airbus and Boeing) expect orders to continue to decline in 2017 at the same time that they are raising production," said Rob Stallard, analyst at Vertical Research Partners. The forecasts are typically released with fourth-quarter results. The final days of 2016 marked a busy time for Boeing's new sales chief Ihssane Mounir. The sales force booked 198 net new orders since Dec. 20, including 189 orders from unidentified customers. The tally did not include any of its pending orders for Iran, the company said. The total included 194 orders worth about US$21 billion at list prices for Boeing's 737 MAX. It also included an order for four 787 Dreamliners from Uzbekistan Airways. Boeing had already disclosed a large part of the tally earlier in the week, when it said it booked 80 orders for its 737 MAX. The new tally lifts Boeing's total backlog to 5,715 commercial jets, equivalent to about seven years of production, the majority of which are 737 planes. Sales of more expensive widebodies such as the 777 and 787 remain sluggish.

The U.S. space agency’s Commercial Crew Program is intended to pay these companies to ferry astronauts up to the ISS, ultimately ending the U.S.’s  sole reliance on Russia for transporting American astronauts to and from the station. “Awarding these missions now will provide greater stability for the future space station crew rotation schedule, as well as reduce schedule and financial uncertainty for our providers,” Phil McAlister, director of NASA’s Commercial Spaceflight Development Division, said in a press statement. “The ability to turn on missions as needed to meet the needs of the space station program is an important aspect of the Commercial Crew Program.” NASA will remain dependent on  Russian rockets to ship astronauts to the ISS until the agency’s long list of stringent safety and reliability requirements for humans on private missions is met. SpaceX has already successfully resupplied the ISS seven times, but one SpaceX resupply mission in June of 2015 resulted in an explosion and a total loss of the spacecraft. The private company Orbital Sciences is also under contract with the space agency to resupply the ISS, but has also had failures. SpaceX and Russian company NPO Energomash are locked in a struggle to supply rocket engines to the U.S. military. Boeing and SpaceX are both competing to be the first private company to send humans to the International Space Station (ISS). SpaceX has a human test flight planned for October 2017, while Boeing has a flight scheduled for May 2018. America’s plans to return to Earth’s orbit are entirely dependent on private companies, some of which are scheduled to launch by the end of next year. Astronauts installed adapters that allowed commercial spacecraft to dock with the ISS in August and give NASA less expensive options to resupply the station. Currently, the U.S. pays Russia more than $70 million dollars per astronaut sent to the ISS. Russia has repeatedly threatened to block America access to the $150 billion ISS in response to U.S. sanctions even though the U.S. paid for 84 percent of the cost of building the station. The last U.S. Space Shuttle to the ISS launched five years ago in July, but NASA still can’t put men into space without Russian cooperation due to President Barack Obama’s cuts to the agency’s exploration and spaceflight capability. SpaceX and Boeing, along with other companies, have made huge advancements in reusable rocketry. Reusable space technology is considered a major advance because it has the potential to lower the costs of getting into orbit, which are high due to expensive rocket components.

EVERETT — The Boeing Co. booked a big flurry of last-minute orders. But it was not enough to defy expectations that the annual tally would fall for a third year in a row. The late additions put Boeing in a position to pass rival Airbus Group in new orders, something it has not done since 2012. Airbus is expected to post its annual tally later this month. Boeing booked 668 new orders in 2016. Most of those — 550 — are for its popular single-aisle 737. It delivered 748 commercial airplanes last year. The 11th hour orders include 75 737s for GE Capital Aviation Services, a deal that was announced Wednesday. They also include another 189 737s for unidentified customers. The boost continues the trend of declining airplane orders in recent years, as airlines pause following a roughly decade-long spending spree. Demand especially has dropped most for bigger, twin-aisle airplanes. The biggest jetliners, Boeing’s iconic 747 and Airbus’ mammoth A380, have collected paltry few orders in recent years. Boeing received orders for 18 747s, the most since 2007. Company executives indicated that they were considering closing the airplane line. However, the new orders gave the 747 program a stay of execution. Through the end of November, Airbus had booked 600 orders, including 509 for its single-aisle A320 family. Deferrals, too, are on the rise as more airlines delay deliveries due to revenue concerns and persistently cheap oil prices. There were 251 delivery delays in 2016, the most since 2001, according to Flight Fleets Analyzer data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence. Last month, Delta Air Lines cancelled orders for 18 787 Dreamliners, orders it inherited from its 2008 merger with Northwest Airlines. Earlier in 2016, Delta pushed back delivery of four Airbus A350s from 2018 to as late as 2020. American Airlines Group also delayed delivery of 22 A350s by an average of 26 months. Competition is picking up, as well. Bombardier beat Boeing this year when it won an order from Delta for 75 of its new C Series airplanes. Both Bombardier in Canada and Embraer in Brazil are trying to break into the narrow-body airplane market. Dan Catchpole: 425-339-3454; dcatchpole@heraldnet.com; Twitter: @dcatchpole.

Posted 07 Jan 2017 00:05 Updated 07 Jan 2017 04:45 Invited guests for the world premiere of the Boeing 787 Dreamliner are reflected in the fuselage of the aircraft at the 787 assembly plant in Everett, Washington, July 8, 2007 REUTERS/Robert Sorbo/File Photo Enlarge Caption  Email More A A SEATTLE: Boeing Co fell 80 planes short of its goal for new orders in 2016, but likely clinched the title of world's biggest planemaker for another year. Boeing on Friday said it delivered 748 jetliners last year and booked net orders for 668 aircraft worth about US$94 billion at list prices. Boeing had predicted orders would roughly match deliveries, which it forecast at between 745 and 750 planes. Boeing's delivery total likely means the Chicago-based aerospace and defense company beat European rival Airbus on output. Airbus has forecast at least 670 deliveries in 2016, and is due to reports totals on Wednesday. Investors watch orders and deliveries closely to gauge future aircraft production levels and revenue, since airlines make most of the payment when aircraft are delivered. Boeing shares were up about 0.1 percent at US$158.86 in mid-day trading. Airlines have slowed their shopping for jets, especially large widebody models, causing Boeing's "book to bill" ratio of new sales to deliveries to fall to its lowest level since 2004. Even so, Boeing's orders fell less than expected, suggesting aggressive sales campaigns at year-end, analysts said. Airbus has a price advantage thanks to the strong U.S. dollar, putting pressure on Boeing's sales team. Looking to 2017, "it's going to be tough for Boeing not to get more aggressive on pricing," said Ken Herbert, an analyst at Canaccord Genuity. Boeing's deliveries also slowed as the company began building the new 737 MAX narrowbody at its factory in Renton, Washington. The first MAX planes take longer to assemble than older 737 models, and cannot be delivered until Boeing finishes flight tests and gets government certification. Even so, Boeing delivered two more 737s in the latest quarter than in the same quarter of 2015. "That says something about the production system," said Howard Rubel, analyst at Jefferies. OUTPUT RISING AS SALES SLOW Deliveries likely will rise this year as MAX planes that welled up in inventory are delivered. But the gain will be tempered by a 40 percent cut in production of 777 widebodies. Analysts expect 777 deliveries will fall to 3.5 a month in 2018, from 8.3 currently, as the successor 777X model enters production. "What we'll be interested to hear is whether (Airbus and Boeing) expect orders to continue to decline in 2017 at the same time that they are raising production," said Rob Stallard, analyst at Vertical Research Partners. The forecasts are typically released with fourth-quarter results. The final days of 2016 marked a busy time for Boeing's new sales chief Ihssane Mounir. The sales force booked 198 net new orders since Dec. 20, including 189 orders from unidentified customers. The tally did not include any of its pending orders for Iran, the company said. The total included 194 orders worth about US$21 billion at list prices for Boeing's 737 MAX. It also included an order for four 787 Dreamliners from Uzbekistan Airways. Boeing had already disclosed a large part of the tally earlier in the week, when it said it booked 80 orders for its 737 MAX. The new tally lifts Boeing's total backlog to 5,715 commercial jets, equivalent to about seven years of production, the majority of which are 737 planes. Sales of more expensive widebodies such as the 777 and 787 remain sluggish.

Investigators looking for missing Malaysia Airline flight MH370 made a "high-speed dash" to a new search site, the Daily Beast reports. On Friday, Dutch-owned vessel Equator reportedly raced to an area in the southern Indian Ocean recently identified as being a more likely location for the plane's debris. It pushed further north on Saturday before tracking back slightly. See related  MH370 conspiracy theories: What happened to the missing plane? The mystery of MH370, EgyptAir flight MS804 and seven other planes that vanished EgyptAir MS804: 'Traces of explosives' found on victims' bodies Dr Richard Cole, of University College London, who has been following the hunt, said: "After its run north, Equator has now tracked back south-west at high speed to a point at 35.3 degrees south where it seems that the [autonomous underwater vehicle] is deployed again." The Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB), which is directing the search, admitted in late December that the area it has scoured for 26 months was unlikely to contain the wreckage of the MH370. Spokesman Dan O'Malley told the Beast yesterday: "Equator is completing its final swing and gathering some sonar data in areas we haven't previously completed. Equator's search operations are expected to be completed by the end of January." Flight MH370 disappeared without trace while flying from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing in March 2014. There were with 239 people on board. The current search, which began in October 2014, is scheduled to end this month. However, families of the victims are stepping up pressure to fund a new investigation in an area to the north of the previous search site.  Voice 370, which represents the relatives, said: "Extending the search to the new area defined by experts is an inescapable duty owed to the flying public in the interest of aviation safety." MH370: Search 'to continue after funding runs out' 6 January Malaysian and Australian officials say the hunt for missing flight MH370 will continue after the original 46,000sq-mile search has concluded, the Daily Beast reports. Since June 2014, two ships using sonar have been combing the area in the southern Indian Ocean where the Malaysia Airline plane was believed to have come down.  The search, which has so far cost £122m, is almost over - the Daily Mail says it could end in just two weeks - but nothing has been found. Last July, Australia, Malaysia and China agreed that "in the absence of credible new evidence leading to the identification of a specific location of the aircraft, the search would be suspended on completion of the existing search area". When asked about this by the Daily Beast this month, the Joint Agency Co-ordination Centre in charge of the search said the position of the three countries "has not changed". However, says the website, "24 hours later", the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) told the website: "Ministers have reiterated that this does not mean the termination of the search," prompting it to ask: "Will Malaysia fund a new search?" The Beast also claims there will be a continuation of the "cutting-edge scientific effort" to find the plane's wreckage, which utilises "resources from all over the world, including from the US". Tests are being carried out to establish how the pieces of wreckage found so far might have floated. The ATSB confirmed two weeks ago it now believes the entire search has been a waste of time because the ships have been looking in the wrong place, CNN reported. Investigators also did not believe the wreckage would be found in the last few weeks of looking. It said: "Given the high confidence in the search undertaken to date, the experts agreed that the previously defined [search] area is unlikely to contain the missing aircraft." New analysis of ocean currents at the time of the plane's disappearance and the positions of the 20 or so pieces of wreckage washed up thousands of miles away suggest the actual crash site was 9,600 miles further north. In fact, says the Beast, scientist now have a far more precise estimate of where the plane came down than the one used to determine where the sonar survey took place. Responding to the ATSB report in December, Australia's transport and infrastructure minister, Darren Chester, said the search would not be extended without new evidence.  Putting himself at odds with the ATSB, Chester said: "We are very close to completing the 120,000 square kilometre underwater search area, and we remain hopeful that we will locate the aircraft." Flight MH370 disappeared on 8 March 2014, flying from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing with 239 people on board. MH370: Boeing could fund private search for plane 3 January A private company is likely to take up the search for the wreckage of Malaysia Airlines flight MH370, according to a distinguished aviation safety expert. John Goglia, a member of the US National Transportation Safety Board, says the private sector will step in after the official Australian-led salvage efforts are called off. "The search will continue, but it will be privately run," he told Popular Mechanics. "It'll be smaller and more focused, but that's probably better." Several aviation experts have suggested that Boeing is the most likely candidate as the plane, which disappeared on a routine flight from Beijing to Kuala Lumpur in March 2014 with 239 people on board, was a Boeing 777. The US manufacturer has not commented on the rumours. A joint search operation by Australian, Malaysian and Chinese authorities, led by the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB), is due to end in January, despite evidence that a revised search zone could hold the key to the plane's final resting place. In its latest report, the ATSB concluded that investigators have been looking in the wrong place for the wreckage of the plane and called for an extension of the search operation to examine the recalculated search area, which lies to the north of the current site. The Australian government has rejected the idea on the grounds that the new evidence is not sufficiently specific to warrant further funding. MH370: Families hit out at decision to abandon search 22 December Families of the 238 people who died on Malaysian Airlines flight MH370 have condemned the Australian government's announcement that the search for the plane is coming to an end, with investigators still no closer to finding the crash site. Flight MH370 lost contract with air traffic controllers and went off radar in March 2014, before apparently crashing somewhere over the Indian Ocean, where the hunt has been focussed. This week, however, a panel of experts from the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) concluded the plane "is probably not in the stretch of ocean a $200 million, Australian-led search effort has combed for the past two years," the Sydney Morning Herald reports. Based on new analysis of MH370's final moments and drift patterns of debris found on east African beaches, investigators now believe the likely location is within a 15,000sq-mile area to the north of the current search zone and have recommended that salvage teams be redeployed there. However, the final resting place of the passengers and crew is likely to remain a mystery, as the Australian government confirmed that countries working on the search were planning to end the costly operation in January unless the ATSB could produce a more specific location. Families of the victims responded with anger and disbelief to the news. Danica Weeks, whose husband Paul was among the passengers, described the decision as "a kick in the guts", the Herald reports. "We've had so much hope and then each time we've got the hope up and it's been washed away," she said. Jiang Hui, whose 72-year-old mother Cuiyun was on the flight, told Fairfax Media "three governments all told us the search would be continuous, would not end, and would not be given up on". He said: "It is a promise to all families and to the international community." MH370: Why have investigators been searching in wrong area?  20 December Investigators searching for missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 have admitted they have been looking in the wrong location and new data indicates the plane is most likely to the north of the current search area. MH370 disappeared on a routine flight from Beijing to Kuala Lumpur in 2014. The search has centred on the southern Indian Ocean, but two years on, no wreckage has been found. Where have investigators been looking? Search teams have been scouring a 46,332sq-mile area of the southern Indian Ocean. However, in November, the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB), which has overseen the search, mounted a review of the investigation that concluded: "There is a high degree of confidence that the previously identified underwater area searched to date does not contain the missing aircraft." Why has the search been unsuccessful? After putting together new flight simulations, modelling drift patterns based on debris matched to the missing plane and conducting further analysis of satellite communications, experts now believe an area immediately to the north of the current search area is most likely to contain the missing plane, the BBC says. "The participants of the First Principles Review were in agreement on the need to search an additional area representing approximately 25,000 sq km (9,700sq-miles)," says the broadcaster. Will the search now continue in this area? Probably not. Australia's transport minister Darren Chester said the search will probably end in January or February, given the new report doesn't identify a "specific location" for the aircraft. The governments of Australia, China and Malaysia had previously decided "we will be suspending the search unless credible evidence is available" identifying the location, he added. MH370 search: What do families of passengers hope to find in Madagascar? 5 December Relatives of passengers lost on Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 are in Madagascar to personally search for debris from the missing aircraft. The group of families, known as Voice 370, has called on the governments of Malaysia, China and Australia to search for wreckage along the east African coast. "All debris thought to be from the plane has so far been found in east Africa," says the BBC. At least six pieces from the area are considered "certain or highly likely" to have come from the missing flight. Flight MH370 disappeared en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing on 8 March 2014. A search operation was launched shortly afterwards, but the main wreckage is yet to be found. Investigators believe it crashed into the Indian Ocean, killing all 239 passengers and crew on board. The search is expected to be suspended by around January or February 2017, when an Australian-led team completes its scouring of a 46,000sq-mile target area. However, Voice 370 has expressed its disappointment at the scale and effectiveness of the search effort. Grace Subathirai Nathan, whose mother, Anne Daisy, was on the flight, has made the self-funded trip along with three relatives from Malaysia, two from China and one from France. They plan to speak to as many people as possible on the island and hand out leaflets about how to recognise plane parts. "We can talk to people who work as fishermen, people who live on the coastline. We hope that we can raise awareness, teach them how to identify debris, how to collect debris, what to do with it when they find it," she said.

The business mogul has caused several stocks to slump — including Boeing, Lockheed Martin, General Motors and, most recently, Toyota — and later rebound, thanks to his Twitter commentary. Toyota Motor said will build a new plant in Baja, Mexico, to build Corolla cars for U.S. NO WAY! Build plant in U.S. or pay big border tax. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 5, 2017 Story continues below In lieu of this new stock market phenomenon, investment monitoring app Trigger has come up with a new feature called “Trump Triggers” which gives users the ability to trade stocks based on Trump’s tweets about publicly traded companies. READ MORE: Donald Trump tweet threatens ‘big border tax’ on General Motors, stocks fall almost immediately The feature will notify you, in real time, when Trump tweets about one of your stocks; you can then move or manage your holdings based on the market’s reactions to his musings. “No one anticipated that a single tweet could potentially eradicate billions of dollars in market cap from large companies,” read a company blog post announcing the feature. “This increased political ‘tweet’ risk is familiar to professional investors and hedge funds on Wall Street, which have traders 24/7, smart algorithms and models to account for this tweeting risk. However, individual investors do not have the appropriate tools to react in an automatic fashion.” Trump’s market moving power was put on display earlier this week after he took aim at GM, threatening to impose a “big border tax” on the carmaker for allegedly sending “Mexican-made” Cruze models to the U.S. General Motors’ stock fell almost immediately. WATCH: President-elect Donald Trump is using Twitter to single out General Motors, which he says is sending Mexican-made cars into the U.S. without paying a penalty. Kenneth Craig reports from New York. General Motors is sending Mexican made model of Chevy Cruze to U.S. car dealers-tax free across border. Make in U.S.A.or pay big border tax! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 3, 2017 Shares of GM, which were at $34.38 in pre-market trading, fell about one per cent; however, shares bounced back, rising one per cent before the market opened. In December, Trump tweeted about the “tremendous cost of the Lockheed Martin F-35,” causing the aerospace company’s stock to tumble. According to The Independent, Lockheed Martin shares fell about two per cent, while Boeing shares saw a one per cent rise that day.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 7, 2015 Justin Connidis, a Toronto-based lawyer and expert in securities law, told Global News Trump’s tweets likely wouldn’t be in violation of securities laws in the U.S., providing they are “valid political comments, or otherwise protected by free speech.” READ MORE: Biden tells Trump to ‘grow up’ in response to transition tweets However, the phenomenon has raised concerns with several pundits, including LA Times columnist Michael Hiltzik who wrote, “Inevitably, pronouncements about anything by a president have an outsized effect.

International Business Times, India Edition International Business Times, India Edition India US World Business Technology Sports Entertainment Auto Photos Video Search Search Home Society So this is what happened before the B-52 bomber's engine fell off A US Air Force B-52 bomber's engine dropped off during training. Aditya Bhat   January 6, 2017 20:22 IST B-52 Stratofortress taking off from Tinker Air Force Base, US.Wiki Commons/Balon Greyjoy The possible reason why US Air Force's B-52 bomber's engine fell off while on a routine training mission has now come to light- an engine failure, top Air Force leaders told Defense News. Will Indian Air Force opt for Boeing KC-46 Pegasus for its six tanker requirements? The Boeing B-52 Stratofortress is a massive aircraft which has eight Pratt & Whitney TF33-P-3/103 turbofan engines mounted under its wings. These are seated in pods of two engines encased by "cowling," a protective structure. It has been suggested that the engine had an internal problem and eventually cracked the protective casing before it fell through. "The engine didn't just fall off. The engine had a failure inside the engine, and it shelled itself," said Gen Robin Rand, head of Air Force Global Strike Command, Air Force is currently conducting an investigation to get to the bottom of the mishap. The aircraft was from the 5th Bomb Wing assigned to Minot Air Force Base, North Dakota. Rand also noted that the mishap would not be used as a justification to procure new propulsion systems. "Re-engining the B-52s makes sense from an operational and an efficiency [standpoint] because there is better technology today then there was when we made the B-52s," he said.  This would reduce the maintenance time for the personnel and  fuel costs, he added. The report also noted that US Air Force does not have budgetary plans in 2018 to fund for the re-engining the 78 B-52s. But it remains to be seen if the new administration under Donald Trump will be able to change it.  Related It can't get stranger!

Business & Tech Picture by Gerry Broome AP/Press Association Images 13:36 6 Jan 2017 Craig Fitzpatrick 13:36 Friday 6 January 2017 Toyota has become the latest company to be on the end of a Donald Trump Twitter lashing, as US President-elect slammed the Japanese car manufacturer’s plans to build a new plant in Mexico.  His threat to impose a “big border tax” on Corollas imported into the US if the factory is constructed south of the Rio Grande echoed tweets directed at the likes of General Motors and Boeing, but marked the first time he laid down a black-and-white ultimatum to a company that does have its roots in America. Toyota Motor said will build a new plant in Baja, Mexico, to build Corolla cars for U.S. NO WAY! Build plant in U.S. or pay big border tax. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 5, 2017 Toyota lost $1.5 billion in value in the five minutes after the tweet. It responded that it contributes nearly $22 billion to the US economy and employs 136,000 people in the country. The company said it looks forward to collaborating with the Trump administration to “serve in the best interests of consumers and the automotive industry". In truth, the New York mogul need not have worried. As announced in 2015, the $1 billion Corolla-making plant is expected to open in 2019 and will be replacing Toyota's plant in Ontario, rather than the US factory in Mississippi. As Business Insider also points out, the plant will be in Guanajuato rather than Baja. The latter already has a Toyota plant, which has been making Tacoma pick-ups since 2002. Toyota joins an ever-expanding list of companies that have raised Trump's ire on social media. General Motors was also threatened with a "big border tax" if it sent its "Mexican made model of Chevy Cruze" into the US. he opined in December that Amazon's "stock would crash and it would crumble like a paper bag" if it "ever had to pay fair taxes. Lockhead Martin Corp and Boeing were accused of demanding "out of control" costs for a brand new 747 Air Force One with the closer: "Finish order!" Giant retail chain Macy's was called out as "disloyal", T-Mobile's service described as "terrible" and Indiana bearing and gears maker Rexnord was attacked for moving to Mexico. On the flipside, Trump has been full of praise for Ford this week after it announced that it was cancelling plans for a new $1.6bn plant in Mexico. Its next-gen Focus will instead by made at an existing plant in Hermosillo, Mexico, to improve profitability, with an investment of $700m and 700 direct new jobs also pledged to its Flat Rock facility in Michigan. expansion of its facility in Flat Rock, Michigan. But Ford says it will build its next-generation 'Focus' at an existing plant in Hermosillo, Mexico "to improve company profitability". The common denominator with the above is that they have been US firms. Today's stand against Toyota expands Trump's protectionist policy to include foreign businesses with US interests. Japan responds Japanese officials and business leaders rushed to highlight the benefits the automotive manufacturer's US ties provides.  Finance minister Taro Aso said: "Toyota is responsible for large employment at US plants such as in Kentucky. It’s questionable whether the new US president has a grasp of how many vehicles Toyota builds in the US." CEOs of companies such as Sony and Nissan also weighed in., hoping to nip any widespread deterioration of Japan-US trade in the bud.  Toyota's full statement reads: "Toyota has been part of the cultural fabric in the US for nearly 60 years. Production volume or employment in the US will not decrease as a result of our new plant in Guanajuato, Mexico, announced in April 2015. With more than $21.9 billion direct investment in the US, 10 manufacturing facilities, 1,500 dealerships and 136,000 employees, Toyota looks forward to collaborating with the Trump administration to serve in the best interests of consumers and the automotive industry. "In 2015, Toyota exported more than 160,000 US-built vehicles to 40 countries, helping to establish the US as a global export hub. "Our manufacturing facilities in Baja, Mexico, established in 2002, support production at our San Antonio, Texas, plant, where 3,300 team members produced over 230,000 Tundras and Tacomas in 2016. "Recent manufacturing expansions by Toyota in the US include: $360 million investment in Toyota's Georgetown, Kentucky, plant, adding 750 new jobs $150 million investment at its Huntsville, Alabama, plant $100 million investment in Toyota's Princeton, Indiana, plant, adding 300 jobs $90 million investment at its Buffalo, West Virginia, plant, adding 80 jobs" 13:36 6 Jan 2017 Craig Fitzpatrick 13:36 Friday 6 January 2017 3 Related articles US Fed is bracing itself for 'Trumpflation' Joe Biden tells Donald Trump to 'grow up' and 'show us what you have' Donald Trump claims any US money spent on border wall 'will be paid back by Mexico later' most popular latest sport The most expensive street in Ireland has been named "I was pissed off": Dublin club footballer fuming that GAA player-coach contract was leaked onto social media Senegal beat Tunisia 2-0 in the African Nations Cup Brendan Rodgers aiming to keep Celtic progressing in 2017 site terms privacy advertise with us contact competitions apps appliancesdelivered.ie © Copyright 2015 - Newstalk Ltd.

Dan Caplinger (TMFGalagan) Jan 6, 2017 at 7:41AM Dividend stocks offer current income and growth potential, and the dividend stocks that you'll find among the 30 stocks of the Dow Jones Industrials (DJINDICES:^DJI) are some of the best-known, highest-quality dividend payers you'll find. Rather than simply buying the entire Dow, however, many dividend investors choose instead to follow a strategy called the Dogs of the Dow. These stocks offer better yields than the Dow as a whole, and often, they've been able to outperform the Dow over the course of the year. Let's take a first look at 2017's Dogs of the Dow to see what you should watch out for over the coming year. The 2017 Dogs of the Dow Stock Dividend Yield Verizon 4.3% Pfizer 3.9% Chevron 3.7% Boeing (NYSE:BA) 3.7% Cisco Systems 3.4% Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) 3.4% IBM 3.4% ExxonMobil 3.3% Caterpillar 3.3% Merck 3.2% Data source: DogsoftheDow.com. 2 new Dogs for 2017 Because of the way that the Dogs of the Dow get picked every year, you can count on seeing some turnover among the 10 stocks that make the cut. However, 2017 is a remarkably stable year for the Dogs, with just two new entrants joining eight carryover picks from 2016. Leaving the Dogs this year are Wal-Mart and Procter & Gamble. Interestingly, neither of the two consumer giants had particularly good years, with both stocks underperforming the broader Dow in 2016. However, a combination of factors resulted in their falling to the No. 11 and 12 spots on the Dow yield list. First, the addition of Coca-Cola came from even worse performance from the beverage giant than its consumer goods peers. Coca-Cola saw its share price fall more than 3% during 2016, as ongoing challenges related to its long-struggling carbonated beverage segment continued to weigh on its prospects. The threat of greater regulation and taxation in some areas has hit Coca-Cola, and efforts to find efficiency gains haven't been adequate to give investors the optimism in the company's future prospects to justify share-price gains. Moreover, the recent strength in the U.S. dollar could once again create difficulties for Coca-Cola, given how much it relies on foreign currency for its revenue and profits. The much more unusual move in the Dogs came from Boeing, which saw its yield jump not because of a decline in share price but rather from a huge raise that the aerospace giant made late in the year. Boeing boosted its quarterly payout in December by 30%, making its quarterly payout $1.42 per share. That helped send its yield up by more than a full percentage point compared to where it started 2016, despite Boeing's solid share-price increase of 8% for the year. The move shows how much confidence Boeing has in its recent success, despite some concerns among investors that the volume of new orders in the future might begin to slow from its breakneck pace of recent years. Image source: Getty Images. Can the Dogs of the Dow beat the market in 2017? You can't count on the Dogs of the Dow always beating the entire Dow, but it has had a recent string of good outcomes. For 2016, the strategy led to a rise of about 16%, topping the 13% gain in the overall Dow. Moreover, the Dogs paid higher dividends that gave the strategy another percentage point of outperformance compared to the overall Dow. That good result brought the Dogs of the Dow's track record to six wins in seven years. The strategy didn't manage to match the Dow in 2012, and in 2014, it took the added returns from dividends for the Dogs to pull ahead. A small win in 2015 also didn't bring much outperformance, but better performance in 2010, 2011, and 2013 has many investors convinced that the Dogs of the Dow are back for good. Yet when you go back 20 years, the win-loss record is much closer to .500 than investors would like to see. The main reason to follow the Dogs of the Dow is that it's a simple way to get performance that's roughly in line with the Dow. Some years will be winners and others losers, but if you want a conservative dividend strategy that emphasizes blue-chip stocks, it's hard to beat the Dogs of the Dow.

During the campaign, Mondelez International Inc., the owner of the iconic cookie brand, was one of the companies that President-elect Donald Trump railed against for sending jobs overseas, alongside the likes of Ford, Carrier and Boeing. But while those other three have already had post-election run-ins with Trump in one fashion or another -- triggering wild stock gyrations and corporate pledges to rework investment plans -- Mondelez curiously has not. Given the president-elect’s current tweeting pace, it feels like it’s just a matter of time before the company comes back under scrutiny. Mondelez wasn’t interested in discussing its game plan for when that moment comes, but experts said it undoubtedly has scrambled to prepare a rapid-fire response. “The last thing they want to do is have a brand out there being attacked,” said Richard Frisch, a crisis-communications consultant. “There’s no question they have a crisis plan in place.” The stakes are high. Last month, when Trump wrote on Twitter that the costs of the F-35 program were “out of control,” shares of defense manufacturer Lockheed Martin Corp. tanked, wiping out almost $2 billion in market value. “We’ve never had a president-elect who could move stocks at will,” said Richard Levick, founder of the communications firm that bears his name. “A Trump tweet rates among the top risks of the year.” ‘Never Eat’ When a company makes nice, on the other hand, it can be rewarded. Ford Motor Co.’s stock rose nearly 4 percent after it announced it was canceling a $1.6 billion Mexican expansion. Hope Hicks, a spokeswoman for Trump, didn’t respond to a request for comment. Mondelez first drew Trump’s ire back in August 2015, when he claimed that the company was eliminating 1,200 jobs in the U.S. as it moved Oreo production to Mexico. “I’ll never eat them again,” Trump vowed. His assertion wasn’t quite true. The global snack giant had decided to invest $130 million in an existing plant south of the border to upgrade cookie and cracker production, rather than putting the money into a factory in Chicago. The move eliminated approximately 600 positions. Stephen Colbert Democratic candidates Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton soon jumped on, too, and The Late Show’s Stephen Colbert mocked Trump’s vow not to eat Oreos by shoveling them into his mouth one night. But the controversy eventually faded into the background. Mondelez, which generates more than 70 percent of its revenue outside North America, said it has invested about $450 million in U.S. manufacturing facilities since 2012, when the company split from Kraft Foods. The company still produces Oreos, the world’s top-selling cookie, at three domestic facilities. “We continue to make investments where it makes sense and that includes the United States,” said Laurie Guzzinati, a spokeswoman for the Deerfield, Illinois-based snack maker. She said the company hasn’t heard from the incoming administration. Mondelez might be better positioned than, say, Boeing Co. or Ford, to resist the pressure of a Trump tweet. It isn’t a big government contractor -- making planes for the military, for instance -- and getting consumers to boycott a favorite snack is difficult. That could weaken Trump’s ability to have a lasting negative impact on the $26.5 billion company, according to Frisch. Still, that may be little comfort. Large food companies tend to be conservative, perpetually seeking to stay away from controversy, particularly of the political variety. And in this unprecedented atmosphere, where the next squabble with the federal government is seemingly just a click away, Mondelez executives are hoping to avoid the glare of Trump’s aggressive Twitter persona. “If you’re Mondelez,” said Tim Calkins, a marketing professor at Northwestern University’s Kellogg School of Management, “the last thing you want is to be a target of Donald Trump." (Corrects to specify that Lockheed Martin lost $2 billion in its market value, not its market share, in sixth paragraph.) Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Search For Missing Malaysia Airlines Plane Ends In 2 Weeks By Suman Varandani @suman09 On 01/06/17 AT 3:36 AM Close The underwater search for Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 ends in two weeks, Malaysia's transport minister said Friday as no concrete clues have been found about the plane's whereabouts. Last month, investigators said in a report that the missing Boeing 777-200 won't be found in the area searched for the past two years. "We're at the final lap within these two weeks," Liow Tiong Lai told reporters, according to the Straits Times. "We hope we can find the plane." Liow added that a tripartite meeting will be held after a final report is released when the 46,000-square-mile search ends, but did not mention a date. Investigators with the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB), the agency leading the hunt for the missing plane, said this week that bad weather was hampering the final stage of the search. Related Stories Bad Weather Impacts MH370 Search In Final Days Boeing To Lead New Search, Aviation Expert Claims Flight MH370 went missing on March 8, 2014, with 239 people on board while on its way from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. Authorities earlier said that the plane may have crashed in a remote part of the southern Indian Ocean. A $145 million search for the aircraft has yielded no clues as to what happened to the plane. Over the last few months, several debris pieces have been found, of which six pieces have been considered certain or highly likely to have come from the missing Flight MH370. The families of those on board the jet have urged authorities to continue the search for the plane, and also blamed officials for not taking debris pieces found in Madagascar, Tanzania and other nearby islands seriously. Last month, some relatives of victims traveled to Madagascar to conduct an independent search for the plane debris. While several conspiracy theories have surfaced since the plane's disappearance, ATSB said in November that the plane was likely out of control when it plunged into the ocean with its wing flaps not prepared for landing, casting doubt on theories a pilot deliberately crashed the plane.

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court ordered the CBI on Thursday to complete probe into the alleged Rs 70,000 crore scam in purchase and leasing of aircraft by Air India during UPA-I government in 2005-06. Attorney General Mukul Rohatgi informed a bench of Chief Justice J S Khehar and Justices N V Ramana and D Y Chandrachud that CBI had registered an FIR in 2013 and has already examined 55 witnesses. "CBI has requested UK for certain information and has so far examined 55 witnesses. Investigations are likely to be completed by June," Rohatgi said. An Empowered Group of Ministers under chairmanship of then finance minister P Chidambaram and comprising then law minister H R Bharadwaj and civil aviation minister Praful Patel was constituted on December 20, 2005. It held discussions with Boeing and GE on December 24, 2005. A note signed by Chidambaram submitted for information and approval of the then Prime Minister for placing orders for 68 aircraft with Boeing with a caveat that Boeing would complete delivery of the planes by 2011 instead of 2012. The PMO on December 30, 2005 informed that the PM has seen note and directed that the ministry of civil aviation "may inform the CCEA about the finalised transaction". The bench headed by the CJI asked CBI to look into all allegations levelled by petitioner, Centre for Public Interest Litigation through advocate Prashant Bhushan, including alleged irregularity in purchase of biometric system for Air India at a cost of Rs 1,000 crore. Bhushan said a Canadian superior court had already found that bribes were paid in bagging the contract for biometric systems by Air India. The petitioner had also questioned allocation of lucrative routes to private airliners at the cost of Air India. When the AG said that looking into all the charges levelled by the NGO would drag the investigation, the bench firmly told him: "We are not going to allow you too much of time given the fact that the FIR was registered in 2013." After the allegations about irregularities in the purchase and hiring of 111 aircraft by Air India surfaced, the Comptroller and Auditor General had given a stinging report questioning the procedure and modus operandi adopted by the civil aviation ministry. On tabling of the CAG report in Parliament, it was referred to the Public Accounts Committee. The PAC had sought certain clarifications and the ministry had given its response on May 3, 2016.

The transaction, which would more than double SpiceJet’s 40-plane fleet, may be closed within weeks after lengthy talks that pitted Boeing against rival Airbus Group SE, people with direct knowledge of the decision said. The deal includes firm orders for at least 50 of Boeing’s 737 Max, and renegotiated terms for 42 of the single-aisle jets that SpiceJet originally ordered in 2014, said the people, who asked not be identified because the discussions are private. The 92 Max jets would be valued at about US$10.1 billion (RM45.15 billion) at current list prices, before the discounts that are customary for large purchases. The order would be a record for SpiceJet, which was forced to shut down operations for a day two years ago after it ran out of money. Current chairman and co-founder Ajay Singh bailed out the low-cost carrier. The airline may boost the total if final talks yield bigger discounts and favorable maintenance contracts, one person said. Boeing would gain a stronger toehold in India, where Airbus dominates narrow-body fleets after a string of order victories. IndiGo, Go Airlines India Pvt and the local unit of AirAsia Bhd all fly variants of the Airbus A320. “We expect to complete these negotiations and place the order this financial year,” the airline said in an e-mailed statement. A Boeing spokesman declined to comment. Crucial market The order would help SpiceJet, India’s second-biggest budget carrier, compete with market leader IndiGo, which has ordered hundreds of Airbus jets to tap surging air-travel demand from a fast-growing middle class. While IndiGo controls about 42 per cent of a market that has seen local carriers almost double to 11 in the past four years, SpiceJet’s share is about 13 per cent. SpiceJet shares rose 4.6 per cent yesterday in Mumbai, paring past year’s losses to 23 per cent. Boeing shares were little changed at US$158.71 in New York. India is crucial for Boeing and Airbus, and both offered aggressive discounts to SpiceJet, Bloomberg News reported in July. Boeing, whose jets dominate the current SpiceJet fleet, has the advantage of close financial ties. As the carrier’s financial condition worsened, Boeing provided assistance with payments to help it cope with the situation. That earlier deal, which is still on the manufacturer’s books, will now become a part of the new order, the people said. SpiceJet operates a fleet of 26 Boeing 737 jets and 14 Bombardier Q400 turboprops, according to its website. IndiGo, operated by InterGlobe Aviation Ltd, in 2015 ordered 250 Airbus A320neo jets. That order followed a 2006 deal for 100 A320 planes, and 180 A320neos ordered in 2011. IndiGo has 126 jets in its fleet. India has been among some of the toughest markets for airlines, with some carriers failing due to fuel taxes, tariffs and low fares. As many as 17 airlines in India have shut down in the past two decades, according to consulting company KPMG and the Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry of India. — Bloomberg                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week World’s eight richest as wealthy as half of humanity, Oxfam tells Davos Trump threatens BMW with border tax on cars built in Mexico Sterling hammered on Brexit reports, Asia markets sink Job cuts, fewer flights?

Final 2016 tallies to be unveiled over the next few days will probably show aircraft orders trailing shipments, a sign of a weakening market. Airline profits are poised to fall from last year’s peak, with even Persian Gulf juggernauts Emirates and Etihad Airways PJSC tempering growth. Advertisement Unlike past retrenchments triggered by terrorism or recession, demand has also been hurt by the relatively low cost of fuel. While oil has risen in the past year, prices are hovering at about $50 a barrel, half of what they were in mid-2014. That gives airlines less incentive to retire older jetliners or order newer, more efficient models. The glut of jets is sapping interest in wide-body planes and threatening production increases that Boeing and Airbus have plotted over the next two years for the lucrative 737 and A320 families of single-aisle aircraft. With last week’s revelation that Emirates is postponing a dozen Airbus A380 superjumbos, the total number of delivery delays for the year reached 251, the most since at least 2001, according to Flight Fleets Analyzer data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence.

Sign up for more newsletters here “It’s not that the sky is falling, but we are definitely late in the cycle,” said Ron Epstein, an analyst at Bank of America Corp. So far, planemakers have been able to find other takers for production slots that have been vacated as carriers such as United Continental Holdings Inc. and Southwest Airlines Co. postpone deliveries and scan the secondary market for bargains. “The real question becomes how long are they able to do that for,” Epstein said during a presentation last month. Advertisement Nobody knows how steep the downturn will be or how long it will last, and the trade war with China threatened by President-elect Donald Trump only adds to the uncertainty. In contrast to previous slowdowns, global air travel is still growing and airlines are mostly making money, providing assurance they’ll follow through on the bulk of their orders. Airbus and Boeing are sitting on a near-record $1.2 trillion order backlog, and to some extent are victims of their own success. Airlines aren’t racing to close deals for jetliner models that are sold out for the rest of the decade, such as Airbus’s A350 and Boeing’s 787 Dreamliner. As the second-largest US defense contractor, Chicago-based Boeing has an added cushion: Weapons sales seem likely to increase because Trump has vowed to boost military budgets, even as he’s railed against costs. There are signs, however, that the aerospace cycle has peaked. Global airline profit this year is forecast to fall 16 percent to $29.8 billion from 2016’s apex, according to the International Air Transport Association, an industry trade group. Another indicator of the aircraft manufacturing’s health, a measure of sales to shipments known as the book-to-bill ratio, is expected fall to the weakest level since the 2009 recession, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. Boeing had netted 470 orders through Dec. 20, well short of its targeted deliveries of 740 to 745 planes for the year. Airbus reported 410 net orders through November. The European planemaker had been aiming to deliver 670 jetliners in 2016, 20 more than it forecast at the start of the year. Loading comments...

There’s an app for that The Trigger Finance app has a feature that notifies, or “triggers,” users about changes in market indicators. The Trump trigger is the most popular on the app, says the company. This app will notify you if Trump tweets about a company you're invested in.  (Star file photo)   By Karen TurnerThe Washington Post Sat., Jan. 7, 2017 Trump’s tweets are proving again and again to have the capacity to make significant waves. Now there’s an app that will send a phone notification to users if Trump tweets about any companies where they own stock. The feature was created by Trigger Finance, an app that notifies, or “triggers,” users about changes in market indicators, Business Insider reported. Since the launch of the feature Wednesday, it’s become the most popular trigger on the app, according to the company. After Trump tweeted about the cost for Boeing to build Air Force One, the company’s stock took a downturn, and a similar stock slump happened for Lockheed Martin after he tweeted about the company’s F-35 jet program, MarketWatch reported. Some company leaders are saying that their PR employees are up around 3 a.m. in case Trump sends out an early-morning tweet that could devastate the company’s stock, CNN wrote in a dispatch from this year’s CES tech trade show. Rachel Mayer, co-founder and chief executive of Trigger Finance, said she’s been hearing “overwhelming” demand from the app’s user base for a Trump tweet notification after his electoral victory in November. “When he tweets, the market moves,” she said by phone. “Our users see this as an investment opportunity and a way for them to manage their portfolio risk.” Article Continued Below Trigger Finance launched last year as a simple tool to help investors monitor the real-world events that affect their stock portfolio. Mayer said that they have long been interested in developing triggers for more non-traditional market indicators, such as announcements from important figures like Janet L. Yellen, head of the Federal Reserve, or billionaire investor Warren Buffett. A Trump trigger is their first foray into this realm, although they’ve been hearing demand from customers for similar triggers for others, such as secretary of state nominee Rex Tillerson and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. “Tweets really do matter,” Mayer said. The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.

Hong) By Marisa Kendall | mkendall@bayareanewsgroup.com | PUBLISHED: January 7, 2017 at 8:00 am | UPDATED: January 9, 2017 at 12:43 pm LOS ANGELES — The upcoming Snap IPO stands to break records and make billions for investors, but the company’s Southern California neighbors hope it will benefit them in a different way — by shining a spotlight on their flourishing tech industry. The startup community in the Los Angeles area has already spawned success stories like Oculus VR and Dollar Shave Club. Now one of the year’s  most anticipated IPOs could be a defining moment for the region as a major tech destination. Venice-based Snap, which reportedly plans to go public with a $25 billion valuation as early as March, would be the biggest offering of a U.S. tech company since Facebook’s 2012 debut. “Snapchat is really the first Silicon Valley-scale company that’s been created in the L.A. area,” said Mitch Lasky, a partner at Menlo Park-based venture capital firm Benchmark, which invested in the company, “and I think that’s going to have profound implications for the future.” Already executives from Uber and Facebook have defected to Southern California, as Silicon Valley struggles with an exorbitant cost of living and a yawning income gap brought on by fast-growing tech companies competing for highly skilled employees. Several Bay Area startups also have packed up and headed for burgeoning tech hot spots in Los Angeles, Venice and Santa Monica. And industry giants like YouTube, Facebook, Google, Yahoo and Netflix have opened offices in the area — known by some as “Silicon Beach” — hoping to capitalize on the region’s media and entertainment legacy. At least by some metrics, Los Angeles already has surpassed the Bay Area in startup activity. In 2016 the City of Angels ranked as the third-most active city in the U.S. for entrepreneurs — beating both San Francisco and San Jose, according to the nonprofit Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation, which studied new business creation. That represents an upset from the year before, when Los Angeles came in fourth, right behind San Jose. Companies in the L.A. area pulled in $4.5 billion in funding in 2015 — up 40 percent from 2014, according to the National Venture Capital Association. “More and more I’m finding companies that I’m excited about investing in that are here,” said Mike Jones, co-founder and CEO of Santa Monica-based accelerator Science. “I’m also finding a surprising number of startups that are willing to move here.” Reading this on your iPhone or iPad? Check out our new Apple News app channel here. L.A.-area startups are a unique breed — they tend to focus on content creation instead of gadgets, building services and apps to run on the computers, tablets and smartphones designed by their Silicon Valley neighbors. That has led to a proliferation of Silicon Beach media startups like Fullscreen Media and Zefr, social apps like Snapchat, Tinder and Whisper, and e-commerce companies like Dollar Shave Club and MeUndies. There’s also a thriving virtual reality scene in the area — Oculus VR was based in Irvine before its $2 billion acquisition by Facebook — thanks in part to talent poached from Hollywood’s film and special effects industry. And the region houses a niche of next-generation transportation companies like Hyperloop One and Elon Musk’s SpaceX that are taking a page from Boeing and other aviation companies with a long history in the region. Experts agree the SoCal tech scene, which has seen major growth in the past five years, is on the upswing, and a successful public debut from Snap will help recruit tech talent to the region and prevent existing talent from leaving. And when Snap employees cash out after the IPO, they’ll have the money to launch their own startups or become angel investors. Snap is one of several companies that have eschewed Silicon Valley in recent years. Snap’s founders, who reportedly dreamed up the idea for their disappearing photo app at a Stanford fraternity house, brought the startup to Venice instead of staying in Palo Alto. Startup Soylent, which makes meal replacement drinks popular with techies, moved from the Bay Area to L.A. shortly after it was founded. One noteworthy benefit to living down south: “You’re not socked in by fog,” said Simon Cassels, who surfs every morning before heading into work as chief marketing officer for Santa Monica-based smart doorbell company Ring. While some Silicon Valley cities attempt to curtail new business development — Palo Alto recently capped construction of new office spaces — Los Angeles is courting tech startups. The city offers some startups free and discounted rent for their first year in downtown Los Angeles and provides tax exemptions for small businesses and companies that recently moved to the city. In October the city held the grand opening of its La Kretz Innovation Campus, a 60,000-square-foot, $47 million accelerator for cleantech startups in the Arts District of downtown Los Angeles. The district, a gritty, street-art-covered neighborhood of old warehouses on the eastern edge of downtown L.A., is becoming a hot spot for startups such as Hyperloop One, the company building the high-speed transportation tubes first conceptualized by Tesla’s Musk. The startup’s sprawling industrial complex, which Hyperloop CEO Rob Lloyd described as “an engineer’s dream come true,” has room for offices, an outdoor space to store segments of prototype tubes, and a lab where engineers test the magnets that will make its passenger pods float as they zip through the tubes. It’s the kind of space that’s rare — and costly — in Silicon Valley. “It’s easier for us to do that than any company in San Francisco when there’s 10 times more people demanding space than available space,” Lloyd said. On the western side of Los Angeles, a cluster of abandoned airplane hangars has become a high-tech hub known as Playa Vista. In 2012 YouTube opened its largest “Space” campus there — a facility where YouTubers can film using professional equipment — in eccentric aviation billionaire Howard Hughes’ former private airport and manufacturing facility. Other companies followed, gradually transforming the ghost town into a crowded tech campus. Blocks of gleaming office buildings sprang up, as did a beach volleyball court, hammocks and outdoor couches. Now Google reportedly is opening a facility across the street from YouTube, and Facebook, Yahoo and startups Rubicon Project and Fullscreen Media have offices nearby. “It really feels like this weird ‘Truman Show’ village,” said Christopher Webb, CEO of ChowNow, a startup that builds online ordering systems for restaurants. ChowNow moved into Playa Vista almost two years ago, after outgrowing its office in Venice.  “Everything is so clean and new and perfect.” A look at some Los Angeles area startups — Snap: Venice.

Now there's an app that will send a phone notification to users if Trump tweets about any companies where they own stock. The feature was created by Trigger Finance, an app that notifies, or "triggers," users about changes in market indicators, Business Insider reported. Since the launch of the feature Wednesday, it's become the most popular trigger on the app, according to the company. After Trump tweeted about the cost for Boeing to build Air Force One, the company's stock took a downturn, and a similar stock slump happened for Lockheed Martin after he tweeted about the company's F-35 jet program, MarketWatch reported. Some company leaders are saying that their PR employees are up around 3 a.m. in case Trump sends out an early-morning tweet that could devastate the company's stock, CNN wrote in a dispatch from this year's CES tech trade show. Rachel Mayer, co-founder and chief executive of Trigger Finance, said she's been hearing "overwhelming" demand from the app's user base for a Trump tweet notification after his electoral victory in November. "When he tweets, the market moves," she said by phone. "Our users see this as an investment opportunity and a way for them to manage their portfolio risk." Trigger Finance launched last year as a simple tool to help investors monitor the real-world events that affect their stock portfolio. Mayer said that they have long been interested in developing triggers for more non-traditional market indicators, such as announcements from important figures like Janet L. Yellen, head of the Federal Reserve, or billionaire investor Warren Buffett. A Trump trigger is their first foray into this realm, although they've been hearing demand from customers for similar triggers for others, such as secretary of state nominee Rex Tillerson and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). "Tweets really do matter," Mayer said. business technology the-switch true Please provide a valid email address. Sign up You’re all set!

(Brendan Smialowski / The New York Times) James Mattis, Donald Trump’s nominee for defense secretary, still lists a modest wood-framed house in Richland, built by the government for Hanford workers, as his residence. He serves on the board of a food bank, stops by the VFW and in November reported for jury duty. Share story By Hal Bernton and David Gutman Seattle Times staff reporters RICHLAND, Benton County — James Mattis, the retired Marine Corps general President-elect Donald Trump plans to nominate for defense secretary, came of age in a cloistered community created by the federal government at the dawn of the nuclear age. In this town carved out of the sagebrush lands of Eastern Washington, nearly everyone had a parent working at the nearby Hanford Engineer Works, site of a large-scale nuclear reactor. The atom bomb was the town’s business, and Columbia High School, Mattis’ alma mater, bore a mushroom cloud atop its crest. Mattis graduated in 1968, as a shy, skinny kid whose parents never bought a television and encouraged him to read from a big home library. In a storied Marine career, he emerged as a keen student of history known for compassion and respect for those he commanded, impatience with bureaucracy and a relentless determination to pursue enemy forces in Afghanistan and Iraq. More on Mattis Mattis to continue reporter access to troops in war zones Mattis has called for 2-state solution in Mideast All the while, Mattis has returned home again and again. In recent years, he has spent most of his time at Stanford’s Hoover Institution, a conservative think tank in California. But he still lists a modest wood-frame Richland house, built by the government for Hanford workers, as his residence. He serves on the board of a food bank, stops by the VFW, and in November reported for jury duty on a gross-misdemeanor case. “I owe this town a great deal because it gave me the values that allowed me to be where I’m at today,” Mattis told the Richland Rotary Club during a 2011 visit. “It was this town that formed me.” Most Read Stories Michael Bennett explodes at reporter following Seahawks-Falcons game Anti-Trumper John Kasich to doubters: I'm no lame duck Can’t make it to D.C.?

Mattis, at the age of 66, is being drawn back into government service by a man with a strikingly different life experience. Trump grew up in a wealthy corner of Queens, promoted himself through New York gossip columns and reality TV, and lives in a gilded Manhattan penthouse in a skyscraper that bears his name. While Trump has long sought the limelight, Mattis, in a brief interview with The Seattle Times, said he was “kind of brought up more to do the job than attract attention to myself.” If Mattis gets a congressional waiver, exempting him from a law that requires a defense secretary to have been out of the military for at least seven years, the relationship that emerges between Mattis and Trump will be an intriguing subplot in the new administration. In a 2014 interview at the University of California, Berkeley, Mattis said leaders without experience in the military can have an exaggerated view of its power. So he sees himself as duty-bound to offer blunt talk about what the armed forces can and — more importantly — cannot do. Mattis gave Trump an early taste of such counsel in November, according to Trump’s account of their meeting. The retired general said waterboarding, advocated by the president-elect, did not work as well as offering a detainee cigarettes and a beer. The Washington Post reported that, in recent weeks, Mattis has clashed with Trump’s transition team over who will get top jobs in the Defense Department. His views on Israel also could put him at odds with Trump. Mattis, in public remarks, has repeatedly supported a two-state solution to the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians. Meanwhile, Trump’s pick for U.S. ambassador to Israel, David Friedman, has called the two-state solution “an illusion.” Mattis’ willingness to serve was indicated in his speech more than five years ago to the Richland Rotary. Mattis said he would be comfortable with whomever the American people elected as commander in chief, and would strive to carry out that president’s orders. But if ever asked to do something he considered “immoral,” Mattis declared, he “would be back fishing on the Columbia River tomorrow.”   The gym floor at Richland High School, formerly Columbia High School, displays a mosaic of the school’s “Bombers” emblem. (Alan Berner / The Seattle Times)   A tight-knit town apart The Richland of Mattis’ youth was born of a radical intervention by the federal government. In 1943, the Army Corps of Engineers, as part of the Manhattan Project to develop the first atomic weapons, took over what was then a rural hamlet of a few hundred people, evicting nearly all the residents. Contractors then moved in to build a boomtown open only to the families of the thousands of men and women working at the secretive Hanford site. The plutonium they made was used in Fat Man, the bomb dropped in 1945 on the Japanese city of Nagasaki that killed more than 70,000 people as World War II drew to a close. After the war, as a new conflict emerged with the Soviet Union, Hanford kept producing plutonium and Richland kept growing with more workers joining the bomb-making effort. Among the recruits was Mattis’ father, John Mattis, who moved his family from Pullman to Richland in the early 1950s to take a job as a power-plant operator at Hanford after a career that had included sea duty as a merchant mariner during World War II. Mattis’ mother, Lucille, was a war veteran, too, having served as an Army intelligence officer based in South Africa. “They had both traveled around the world,” Mattis recalled in the 2014 interview. “They introduced us to a world of great ideas — not a fearful place — but a place to enjoy.” Mattis was drawn to books on geology and the American West, and relished the opportunity to hike, camp and hunt for jack rabbits in the desert around Richland, according to interviews with childhood friends. Most everyone in Richland came from someplace else. But it was a tight-knit town, with residents united by a common pride and purpose in their Hanford work. James Mattis’ 1968 high school senior picture. “Nobody had extended families, so the families that you relied on were neighbors,” recalled Jim Albaugh, a retired CEO of Boeing’s commercial airplanes division and a classmate and childhood friend of Mattis. By the 1960s, Richland had opened to anyone who wanted to take up residence. But Hanford was still the dominant employer, and the town remained largely apart from the decade’s counterculture and Vietnam War protests. As a teenager, Albaugh recalls a life centered on the Spudnut Shop that featured potato-flour doughnuts, the Uptown movie theater and the high school, where Albaugh played on the Bombers basketball team and Mattis was the JV team manager In a class of nearly 600 students, Mattis didn’t rank in the top 10 percent, according to the program from his high school graduation. He was thoughtful and interested, Albaugh said, but “I don’t think anyone would have singled him out for greatness.” And, although Mattis, the never-married Marine, would later gain the nickname “Warrior Monk,” Albaugh says his friend enjoyed high school social life and was no straight arrow. Others recall a kid willing to stand up for the underdog. “I was bullied a lot, but this was one of the … guys who respected me for who I was and what my character was,” said Lloyd Campbell, a high school classmate. After graduation, Mattis went to what is now Central Washington University, where he majored in history and followed his older brother Tom into the Marines as he enrolled in ROTC and obtained a commission as a second lieutenant in 1972. In the 2014 interview, Mattis noted there was a draft back then and little choice about military service. “I don’t think I had the intention of making it a career at that point,” Mattis recalled.   Then-Brig. Gen. James Mattis walks past an honor guard as he arrives at a funeral service in Afghanistan in December 2001. (Dave Martin / EPA)   ‘Have a plan to kill’ Mattis would stick with the Marines for more than 40 years, achieving the rank of four-star general. He joined at the tail end of the Vietnam era, and didn’t face combat, yet he would eventually lead Marines into battle in three other wars. He commanded a battalion in the Persian Gulf War against Iraq in 1991. He led an air-ground assault in Kandahar province, Afghanistan, in the aftermath of 9/11 and a Marine U.S. division during the 2003 Iraq invasion, returning again as the U.S. forces faced a growing uprising in Anbar province. “Be polite, be professional, but have a plan to kill everybody you meet,” was some of the advice Mattis gave his Marines in Iraq, according to author Thomas Ricks. In his book “Fiasco,” Ricks called Mattis one of the U.S. military’s more “intense intellectuals,” who could quote Homer and brought along the Meditations of Marcus Aurelius, when he deployed to a war zone. Yet Mattis could also be coarse and profane. While a lieutenant general, talking on a 2005 panel in San Diego, he offered this view of fighting the Taliban: “You go into Afghanistan, you got guys who slap women around for five years because they didn’t wear a veil. You know, guys like that ain’t got no manhood left anyway. So it’s a hell of a lot of fun to shoot them …” Those comments stirred controversy for the general who acquired the nickname “Mad Dog” in Iraq and a commander’s admonition to choose his words more carefully. But they did not slow his career. Within two years, Mattis was the NATO Supreme Allied Commander Transformation, then chosen to head U.S. Central Command, in charge of all U.S. forces in the Middle East. Retirement, in January 2013, came earlier than expected. Some analysts attributed it to friction with the Obama administration, including Mattis taking a more hostile view of Iran than other high-level officials. Mattis’ perspective on Iran was reflected in his talk to the Richland Rotarians when he pointed to a map of the Middle East and noted the actions of Iranian-backed forces in various locations. “Everywhere you go, you find Iran’s hand …”   James Mattis, fourth from left, at his Columbia High School 45-year class reunion in 2013. The school name was later changed to Richland High School. (Courtesy of Rick Valentine)   ‘Just that kind of guy’ After leaving the military, Mattis deepened his ties to Richland, a city that by then had a population of more than 50,000. Though Hanford in the post-Cold-War-era remains the main employer, the work has shifted from generating plutonium to cleaning up the radioactive waste at the most-polluted nuclear site in America. Mattis put his skills to work on the board of the Tri-Cities Food Bank, which offers groceries to about 1,000 families a week. ValJeanne Meadows, the board president, said she sought out Mattis for the post three years ago, and they connected over shared concerns for their aging mothers. “All moms wish that our sons care about us like that,” Meadows said. “She is just very important to him.” Mattis has been an active board member, asking lots of questions, taking time to unload trucks and distribute food to families. He reaches out in other ways around town, too. At the VFW this fall, he ran into an old childhood friend who served in Vietnam. “He saw me and gave me a big hug,” said Dwight Carey. “He’s just that kind of guy.” Visits home are likely to be less frequent if Mattis takes over at Defense. And some who have enormous respect for him question whether overseeing a massive bureaucracy would play to his strengths. “Budgets, white papers, and service rivalries, not to mention the interagency meetings and White House meddling — these tasks are not what you go to Jim Mattis for,” wrote Erin Simpson, a former assistant professor at the U.S. Marine Command and Staff College, in a commentary. But Albaugh, the former Boeing leader, thinks Mattis would delegate wisely. Albaugh rekindled his childhood friendship with Mattis after the two had an unexpected encounter in the Pentagon in the late 1990s, and he says they “compare notes” whenever they find themselves in the same place. “I think it was a terrific pick,” Albaugh said. Mattis certainly has long pondered one of the most grave questions a defense secretary may confront: When should a country go to war? In the 2014 interview, he said you must start with a clear political goal, and that the costs of a war must be clearly spelled out, regardless of career consequences. “You do what your duty tells you, and let God sort out the rest,” Mattis said. Even as he heads off to Washington, D.C., and his expected new job, Mattis appears to be thinking beyond this next stint of government service to life back in Richland. When he is finished as defense secretary, Mattis told Meadows, he hopes to get back to work for the food bank. Hal Bernton: 206-464-2581 or hbernton@seattletimes.com.

It’s a Chevrolet Suburban. Made in the USA,” Donald Trump told the Detroit News last year when the then presidential hopeful was asked to name his favorite car from his 100-plus vehicle fleet that includes a scissor-door Lamborghini Diablo and a 1956 Rolls-Royce Silver Cloud. 'Just the beginning': Trump may disrupt 20-year boom for Mexico auto industry Read more For General Motors, Chevy’s owner, it was nice PR, the latest in a series of endorsements from the Trumps that reach back like a stretch limo to the Cadillac Trump’s landlord father Fred used to pick up his rent checks. In the 1980s Donald Trump even worked on building a Trump-branded Cadillac, complete with VCR and paper shredder. The Trumps may be fans of the US’s largest car manufacturer but GM, and the car industry in general, should have been paying more attention to the final sentence of his pre-election endorsement: “Made in the USA.” Trump hit out at the car industry last week like a drive-by shooter, firing off a series of angry tweets about their outsourcing of US jobs. Those tweets will be the hottest topic this week as Detroit’s annual car jamboree, the North American International Auto Show, gets started. It’s a chance for the industry to show off all its latest products and for its executives to address the media about the future. Trump’s blimp-like shadow is overhanging the event as executives and analysts fret about how this overtly interventionist president will use the bully pulpit of his office, and his Twitter account, to try and force a radical change in the way they do business. “Pretty much everybody is dreading being the subject of a tweet. Getting hauled out into the court of public opinion with virtually no warning is not something anybody wants to get engaged with,” said Kristin Dziczek, director of the industry, labor and economics group at the Michigan-based Center for Automotive Research (CAR). Facebook Twitter Pinterest Inside Donald Trump’s 1988 Cadillac: the ‘best limo in the world’ had rosewood interiors and was equipped with a fax machine, TV, VCR, paper shredder and built-in safe. Photograph: Jules Annan / Barcroft Images The auto industry matters to the US and to Trump. Six years after a recession that almost destroyed it, the US car industry has made a miraculous recovery. Last week it reported record sales for 2016. Auto manufacturers, suppliers and dealers employ over 1.5 million people and directly contribute to the creation of another 5.7m jobs, according to the CAR. Trump won thanks in large part to states where the auto industry is strongest. The Republican candidate took Michigan, home to the auto show and still the industry’s hub, from the Democrats for the first time since 1988 with a campaign that tore into companies that have sent those voters’ jobs abroad, especially to Mexico. Ford bore the brunt of Trump’s attacks during the election. Last week it was GM’s turn. Then Toyota’s. “General Motors is sending Mexican-made model of Chevy Cruze to US car dealers-tax free across border. Make in USA or pay big border tax!” the president elect warned via his favorite megaphone, Twitter. Two days later, he was after Toyota. “Toyota Motor said will build a new plant in Baja, Mexico, to build Corolla cars for US. NO WAY! Build plant in US or pay big border tax,” he tweeted. Toyota’s plans were old news but the tweet came on the same day that its president, Akio Toyoda, had told reporters he was keen to work with the president-elect. Auto industry jobs across the US. These were the latest in a series of attacks on major US employers, including Carrier, Boeing and Lockheed Martin, that have so far brought CEOs running, cap in hand, to Trump Tower to make up for their alleged corporate misdeeds. Shortly after the GM tweet, Ford announced it had canned plans to open a $1.6bn plant in Mexico and would add new jobs building electric and hybrid vehicles at a plant in Flat Rock, Michigan. Trump hailed the move: “Thank you to Ford for scrapping a new plant in Mexico and creating 700 new jobs in the US. This is just the beginning – much more to follow,” he tweeted. Matt DeLorenzo, managing editor for Kelley Blue Book, said Trump was “playing to his base and a lot of the voters who put him in office were industrial midwest, blue collar, union workers. All his tweets and pronouncements have been geared to addressing that audience,” said Matt DeLorenzo, managing editor for Kelley Blue Book. Ford had already warned that the car industry was expecting a slowdown in sales, especially of smaller vehicles like the ones that would have been built in Mexico. So scrapping the plan makes economic as well as political sense for the company, but market watchers doubt the industry and Trump’s agendas will remain compatible. GM is expected to start laying off more than 3,000 factory workers in Michigan and Ohio, another state that voted for Trump, starting later this month. Will they defend that decision if Trump goes on the attack? The car industry is truly international and China is its largest market. GM and its joint venture partners sold 3.87m vehicles in China in 2016, up 7.1% from the previous year. China accounts for a third of GM’s sales. Like its corporate peers, GM has – so far – remained silent over Trump’s anti-China rhetoric, but a trade war would be a disaster for the company. Facebook Twitter Pinterest What will be the first actions Trump takes as president? Some wonder if Trump will really translate tough talk into policy. “There is always a difference between campaigning and governing and we have not yet seen what governing looks like,” said Dziczek. Others are more concerned. Trump is in a honeymoon period because “there is nobody speaking out”, said Daniel Ikenson, director of the Herbert A Stiefel Center for Trade Policy Studies at the Cato Institute. Republicans have remained silent as he has attacked businesses they once defended and the business community has even gone out of its way to endorse Trump cabinet picks that have overt protectionist views, he said. 'Fear and threats': Mexico hits back after Trump pressures automakers Read more The incoming president has clearly signalled that Obama’s trade-friendly, internationalist era is over, said Ikenson. The US steel industry lawyer Robert Lighthizer is Trump’s choice for United States trade representative, the anti-China economist Peter Navarro is set to head the newly created National Trade Council at the White House and the billionaire investor Wilbur Ross, a staunch critic of the US’s existing trade agreements, is Trump’s pick to lead the commerce department. “These are people who if you mentioned them a few months ago, businesspeople would shudder. Now: ‘Hey, great idea, we like the enforcement mentality.’ They are scared. To me, this is extremely disconcerting and dangerous. This silence of people who should be speaking out is reminiscent of the 1930s. The stakes might be different but the it’s a similar sort of thing,” Ikenson said. So far, corporate reaction to Trump’s election has been bland; business leaders like that he’s is “pro-growth” and wants to cut red tape. But that may change once Trump is in office. The president may also find that changing the industry is harder than he thinks. The auto industry is a global supplier with a global supply chain. While it’s politically easy to target US neighbours like Mexico for “taking American jobs”, the real picture is more nuanced than anything you could fit into a 140-character tweet. Forty per cent of the parts that make up the average vehicle imported to the US from Mexico were made in the US. “We are sending them parts, engines, transmissions that then come back to us as vehicles that have been assembled,” said Dziczek. Imposing duties on foreign imports makes about as much sense as “building a concrete wall in the middle of what used to be Ford’s Dearborn plant”, said Ikenson. “The factory floor spans borders and oceans now. Imposing tariffs like this is like separating the chassis line from the engine line.” Mexico CAR is predicting Mexican auto assembly capacity will more than double in size between 2010 and 2020, thanks in part to lower labour costs but also to Mexico’s free trade agreements with 40 countries that give it access to 47% of the world’s automotive market. In the next five years, CAR predicts, most Mexican car exports will go to countries outside the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta), which Trump has attacked for taking US jobs. Dziczek doubts one man, even the US president, can hold back those forces. “You put a plant in place for 30 or 40 years. You don’t worry about four to eight years. Plants last a lot longer than presidents,” she said. As Trump prepares to take office, Ikenson said he worried that autoworkers and other voters who backed Trump in part as a protest against the impact of decades of free trade may not like what they get. If trade agreements are scrapped and imports imposed on foreign goods, “they will be the first wave of casualties. We went from 19m workers in manufacturing in 1979 to about 12m today. That goes down to 10m workers,” he predicted. But Trump and Trump’s voters have heard this argument before and they aren’t buying it. On the crowded floor of Detroit’s Cobo Center this week, and in the suites and conference rooms of its hotels, the car industry’s biggest brains will all be working overtime trying to figure out how to deal with the man their workers elected.

The world's largest aerospace company by sales closed 2016 with 668 net new orders worth $94.1 billion at list price, missing its goal of matching new deals with deliveries as it shipped 748 jets over the year. Rapid growth in air travel in Asia and the arrival of new more-fuel-efficient jets, just as oil prices started to rebound, fueled demand from airlines and leasing companies for planes from Boeing and rival Airbus SE. However, growth has cooled, particularly for larger twin-aisle jets used for international flights, leading both companies to trim production of those models. Boeing still has a backlog stretching out for seven years of production and this week added deals for almost 200 new jets secured in the final days of last year. The late surge lifted its book-to-bill ratio -- which measures incoming orders against deliveries -- to 0.9. "To many investors, a book-to-bill [below one] is traditionally the end of the cycle," said Buckingham Research analyst Richard Safran. The Chicago-based plane maker had 768 net new jet orders in 2015 and an average of more than 1,300 in each of the prior three years as the boom lasted longer than previous industry cycles. Airline profits and jet purchases are closely tied to global economic growth, which in turn fuels passenger and cargo traffic. The sluggish pace of new orders in the second half of last year led most investors to expect Boeing to miss its internal target of matching orders and deliveries, with more attention focused on its ability to deliver more jets as it prepares to boost output of its best-selling 737 single-aisle jets. The company secured deals for 848 new jets last year but had cancellations for 180, the majority of them from customers switching to the new 737 Max model that is due to start operating later this year. Boeing has yet to book an 80-plane contract completed with Iran Air in December, citing the need for further government approvals. Airbus plans to include a 100-plane deal with Iran Air in its 2016 tally, due to be released on Jan. 11. Analysts expect the European manufacturer to have secured orders for around 600 jets last year compared with 1,080 in 2015. While carriers such as Southwest Airlines Co. and Turkish Airlines have deferred some deliveries, Boeing executives have said such moves remain below their historical average. Airlines pay the bulk of an aircraft's price on delivery, and Boeing's 748 deliveries last year compared with 762 in 2015. The new 737 Max is central to Boeing's expansion plans, and unlike the 787 Dreamliner, its development has been relatively smooth. Norwegian Air Shuttle ASA expects to take its first planes in May, well ahead of Boeing's original target of delivering the initial planes by the third quarter. Southwest Airlines also expects to receive the planes this year.

This photograph of Azalea Park was used often to promote the area. Click here to enlarge image 1947: Serious matters and a newfangled invention Claudia Elliot Published Jan 6, 2017 at 07:30PM Three important matters found their way onto the pages of the Pilot in the fall of 1947: taxes, a landmark decision about Indian lands, and the arrival of a new-fangled invention in Brookings. Also worth noting, a young man named Gene Gould — who graduated in the spring from high school in Brookings and had been working for the Pilot for 15 months, headed off to Eugene to enroll in the University of Oregon School of Journalism. Gould had moved to Brookings from Los Angeles with his parents (who later owned a shoe store). At his high school in California he had taken a course in printing, and his skills were highly valued by the Pilot. Through other research, I learned that Gould served in the Air Force in Korea after he graduated from college in 1951. He later settled in Seattle, beginning a long career with Boeing. He retired in 1990, and continued living in Virginia until his death on March 17, 2016. School opening delayed Brookings schools were set to open Sept. 15, but the opening was postponed after voters refused to approve an increase in the tax levy. “We have no money on which to open,” a school district official said. Without approval by voters the district would have only $26,058.53 to operate. The proposed budget was $34,840. There were 142 students in grades one through six and 133 in grades seven through 12. Finally, on Oct. 2, the school budget carried by a vote of 219-120. It was the largest vote in the history of the school. Opponents were unsuccessful in their appeal to the state tax commission. Sales tax vote A statewide vote was held in October in an attempt to impose a sales tax throughout the state to support schools, welfare and other government. Supporters said the measure would reduce property taxes by 22 percent and also lower income tax, support school districts without increasing property taxes and guarantee old-age assistance by making up whatever is lacking from declining liquor revenues. Like earlier attempts to impose a sales tax, the measure failed. Indian Lands settlement A big story throughout the latter half of 1947 concerned the value of more than 2.7 acres of Oregon land that a court had ruled (in 1946) was taken from Native Americans without compensation. In August more than 70 people attended a special meeting of Curry County Indian Heirs Association in Brookings. Attendees were assisted in filling out identification blanks and heard a report from geologists, who were making an appraisal of the amount of minerals taken from area since 1855. An appraisal of timber values of 1855 had been completed. Reports were to be submitted to courts on Oct. 20. In October, a front page story reported that a ruling was expected by early 1948 following hearings in which more than three-score documents introduced by the Tillamook, Coquille, Too-Too-To-ey and Chetco indians to bolster their claim the land was worth more than $13 million in 1855. According to the Pilot, the hearings were the result of a U.S. Supreme Court decision declaring that the Indians had the right to recover the 1855 value of the land taken from them by settlers after they were moved to the Siletz Reservation through a treaty never ratified by the United States Senate. The Pilot and the Indians had no way of knowing at the time that the landmark court decision (United States v. Alcea Band of Tillamooks) was just one more chapter in the complicated story of the relationship between the government and the native people of Western Oregon. The complete story is beyond the scope of this column, but I can find no evidence that the native people of Curry County received the payments they thought might be coming in 1947. “Automatic laundry” With all of that serious news was interesting coverage of an “automatic laundry” with three washing machines and one clothes dryer that C.A. MacKenzie opened in Brookings in the fall of 1947. This was big news, as the washing machines would automatically wash and rinse and leave the wash “drier” than a wringer-type machine. And the installation of a clothes dryer meant people wouldn’t have to hang their clothing inside on rainy days. “This automatic laundry idea is not new,” the Pilot reported, “for many cities all over California have such establishments, and women use them, even if they do have washing equipment at home, all because of the time saving. Washing is done on a per pound-hour basis and said to be low in cost.” An advertisement suggested making an appointment to avoid waiting your turn. The interior of the new “Launderall” was “a pleasing light green” with chairs and tables provided so that wash day can be used by the women to write letters, do some fancy work or visit, the newspaper reported. Bridge games were also anticipated. The innovation was celebrated by an editorial in the Pilot. “When we think of how our grandmothers (and mothers to many of us) used to use the old washboard and the boiler sitting on the range, and then look at this new convenience Brookings has, we see that we have come a long way, in some things,” editor Dewey Akers wrote. “After a woman puts her wash in these machines, she never touches them until they are completely rinsed. The hands never really get wet while transferring the clothes to the dryer, something to remember, while attempting to do the family wash in any other manner.” ~~~ Claudia Elliott is a freelance writer.

Country(s) United States Australia India Hong Kong England - - - More Countries Industry News January 2017 Su Sa Fr Th We Tu Mo 15 14 13 12 11 10 9 New Business Book Summary Available for The Network Imperative     The Network Imperative   Spread the Word Listed Under Tags: • Technology • Digital Technology Industry: • Business Location: • Ipswich - Massachusetts - USIPSWICH, Mass. - Jan. 6, 2017 - PRLog -- Digital transformation is impacting every industry, and the performance gap between the early and late adopters of digital platforms and networks is widening. Considering this accelerating reality, organizations need to transform their business models to keep pace or they will fall prey to today's digital elite. In The Network Imperative, Barry Libert, Megan Beck, and Jerry Wind demonstrate how incumbent (non-digital, non-network, non-platform) organizations can grow and profit by shifting their capital (time and money) from tangible, physical, firm-based offerings to embracing intangible, digital, network-based business models. The authors provide 10 levers every organization can pull and a 5-step process to pivot toward greater growth and profits in today's hyperconnected world. The author believes that today's digital network businesses--best exemplified by Amazon, Alphabet (aka Google), Apple, Facebook, and Microsoft--deliver far greater growth, profits, and value than traditional, incumbent firms like Walmart, GE, GM, and Boeing. However, the best practices they have implemented in their firms are available to every organization. They include: 1. Recognizing the value of digital networks and platforms. Organizations that invest their resources in digital platforms and virtual network business models outpace the market by growing faster, scaling with lower marginal costs, and generating greater value. Leaders, partners, and customers of network organizations also benefit from the fulfilling, mutually rewarding relationships that successful network organizations create. 2. Developing digital strategies and platforms to create network effect. Network and platform organizations operate with a different mindset than traditional organizations. They see excess capacity and under-utilization (homes, friends, knowledge, and capabilities) where others see limited opportunity and full utilization. They focus on "access" versus assets. 3. Implementing customized network and platform business models. Business leaders can customize their growth and profits by identifying their current business models, evaluating all their assets (especially intangibles), envisioning their new digital business models, building the right team and board, and measuring the right metrics using today's machine learning and big data. 4. Becoming network leaders in every sector. Top-performing business leaders are adaptive. They invert their old beliefs, take in new ideas, and adjust their mental models to operate in new ways that focus less on what they have or do and more on what the network has, can do, and can offer. In addition, they are open to exploring new ventures and business models as market needs change.

An in-flight emergency was declared Wednesday and the crew landed the plane safely, according to Minot Air Force Base. No injuries were reported on the ground or among the plane's five crew members. No weapons were on board, according to the military. A B-52 has eight engines, according to Boeing, the plane's manufacturer. The Air Force said the engine fell in a remote area about 25 miles northeast of the base that's near Minot, a city about 110 miles north of Bismarck. "They do believe at this point that it was really a catastrophic failure of that one engine," James told the Minot Daily News. "Another way of putting that is it disintegrated and then fell out of the aircraft upon disintegration. "They think it's at the bottom of a river, so recovery of that is something we would like to do because that helps in understanding what happened," she said. Dom Christianson, who lives in Upham, told KXMC-TV that he saw several military helicopters flying over the J. Clark Salyer National Wildlife Refuge northeast of Minot. The Souris River runs through the refuge. "Average day until about noon, when we had helicopters flying over town and flying really low out across the refuge out here," he said. "It went on for about four hours." Base spokesperson Maj. Jamie Humphries told The Associated Press on Friday that a military team is surveying the area but is hampered by large amounts of snow. Former National Transportation Safety Board chair and retired Air Force Maj. Gen. Mark Rosenker told KFGO-AM radio that the incident is "absolutely extraordinary." James said there is "zero indication" the engine incident is a widespread problem within the B-52 fleet. "There's no evidence of that. It appears this was a one-off situation, but again I want to emphasize it just happened and it will be fully investigated," James said. The investigation is expected to take months, Air Force officials said. In the meantime, there are no restrictions on the roughly two dozen other bombers at the base, Humphries said.

Privacy Policy The market has been positively ebullient since Donald Trump’s unexpected election victory. Though much remains to be seen, investors have been giddy about the prospect of corporate tax cuts, a regulatory rollback, and a presumably more business friendly executive branch. Of course, as with any new presidential administration, there are significant caveats. And for a politician as unconventional as Donald Trump, there are probably more caveats than usual. Even if Trump and the Republican Congress deliver on these goodies, there’s still the ever-present risk of the president-elect’s itchy Twitter trigger finger. And it’s possible that could curtail some of the appetite for risk among corporate America’s leading executives. Such animal spirits have been sorely lacking since the downturn, and a return to risk-taking (and business investment) is necessary to kick off the next growth cycle. However, Trump’s very unpredictability could end up keeping the atmosphere of uncertainty alive for businesses, perhaps limiting the effect of certain growth-oriented policies. After all, CEOs never know when a populist president might single out their company for a social-media thrashing, and whether they’ll have to reallocate their firm’s resources accordingly. Trump has previously put Boeing, Carrier, Ford, General Motors, and Toyota in the spotlight, among others. And he has even won apparent concessions from some of these companies, thus putting the presidential bully pulpit to effective use before even taking the oath of office. In the Crosshairs A couple of Utility Forecaster’s favorite cable and telecom companies have also faced unwelcome attention from the president-elect. Perhaps chafing at the media pile-on during the final weeks of the election, Trump declared that he would oppose AT&T Inc.’s (NYSE: T) $85.4 billion mega-merger with Time Warner Inc. (NYSE: TWX), which owns CNN in addition to other plum media assets. Speaking about the deal during a campaign rally, Trump said his administration would not approve the merger “because it’s too much concentration of power in the hands of too few.” The would-be trust buster then vowed to find a way to separate Comcast Corp. (NSDQ: CMCSA) from NBCUniversal, a merger that was consummated several years ago. While some observers speculated that these remarks were probably just campaign-trail bluster, Bloomberg reported on Thursday that one Trump confidant claims the president-elect remains opposed to AT&T’s deal, as does Trump’s chief strategist, Steve Bannon. Of course, as we’ve seen with previous speculation surrounding Trump’s positions, third-party accounts of his actual thinking on a matter aren’t worth all that much. Even so, the news sparked a modest selloff among cable, media, and telecom companies. Shares of Time Warner currently trade at an 11.7% discount to the deal price of $107.50 per share. The stock’s narrowest discount on a closing basis was 10% and occurred earlier this week. Although shares of AT&T are down about 3.9% from their high earlier this week, they’re still up 12.6% from their post-election low.   Meanwhile, AT&T has already found a way to possibly sidestep the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), the quasi-independent federal agency that wields the most power when reviewing such deals. The companies believe that the merger will not require any of Time Warner’s FCC licenses to be transferred to AT&T in order to conduct normal operations. The media giant could also divest such licenses prior to the deal’s close, a move that would require the FCC’s review, but one that would theoretically be separate from any consideration regarding the merger. Though both the U.S. Dept. of Justice (DOJ) and the FCC exercise oversight on such deals, the FCC is the entity that would hold the proverbial (and actual) trump card. That’s because the DOJ’s review is limited to anti-trust concerns, and the agency is unlikely to reject a deal between two entities that operate in different industries. The FCC, however, has far broader latitude when reviewing such deals and has blocked similar tie-ups in the past. So if the merger can avoid FCC scrutiny on a technicality, then it would save both companies a lot of potential heartache. As for Trump’s own attitude toward the deal? We don’t need to rely on anonymously sourced articles. We expect the freewheeling president-elect will offer his latest take soon enough via Twitter.

Shortly after graduating with a bachelor’s degree in political science from New York University, Ari sampled some of Wall Street’s best-known brokerages and investment banks for several months as a temporary associate. His favorite memory was being paid an absurdly high hourly wage to point and yell at the bond salesmen on the legendary Bear Stearns trading floor when they had incoming phone calls. Thereafter, Ari spent a substantial portion of his career at financial industry rating services. First, he pored over spreadsheets for the corporate accounting department at Moody’s Investors Service. Later, he analyzed investment newsletters for nearly eight years at The Hulbert Financial Digest (HFD). While working for the HFD, Ari discovered his passion for helping self-directed investors select the right investment newsletter. Since joining Investing Daily, he’s extended that passion further by guiding investors toward the right securities for their portfolios. In addition to writing about investment newsletters for the HFD and MarketWatch, Ari has also written about food, music, comics and culture for publications ranging from Mass Appeal to Punk Planet. In his free time, he and his wife tote their son along on their ethnic dining adventures in pursuit of the fabled Bosnian burger and the Thai restaurant with the secret Laotian menu. show more Market Overview Free E-letters We offer a variety of FREE analysis delivered weekly to your inbox.

Banking & Finance Construction Education Energy Healthcare Media Real Estate Retail Technology Transport Travel & Hospitality Qatar Airways plans major expansion of Americas cargo network Doha airline says it will launch freighter operations to four new destinations in the Americas, starting in February Article Photos By Staff writer Friday, 6 January 2017 1:43 AM Qatar Airways Cargo has announced that it will launch freighter operations to four new destinations in the Americas, starting in February. Boeing 777 freighters will fly twice a week to the South American cities of Buenos Aires, Sao Paulo, Quito and the North American city of Miami, the airline said in a statement. The twice weekly freighter service will depart from Doha via Luxembourg, the cargo carrier’s European hub, with stops at Sao Paulo in Brazil, Buenos Aires in Argentina and Quito in Ecuador. On the return leg, the freighter will stop in Miami, Florida and Luxembourg before arriving in Doha. The airline said the new freighter services aim to meet the growing demand for import and export trade in the region and will supplement the belly-hold cargo capacity on Qatar Airways daily flights to Sao Paulo, Buenos Aires and Miami. Ulrich Ogiermann, Qatar Airways chief officer cargo, said: “We are excited to start 2017 with the launch of four new freighter destinations. These new destinations will connect the burgeoning import and export markets in the Americas region with the rest of the world.” The launch brings the cargo carrier’s total freighter destinations in the Americas to 12 while offering belly-hold services to 13 cities on the continent.

Idaho Business Health Nation/World Elections Photos Business Drone engine maker to set up facility in Columbia Gorge FRIDAY, JAN. 6, 2017, 10:14 A.M. The Seattle Times Twitter Facebook  Email  Reddit  SMS SEATTLE – An Australian company that makes engines for aerial drones is planning to set up a facility in the Columbia Gorge, following a $90 million agreement to supply engines for a Boeing subsidiary. Orbital, based in Perth, signed a three-year deal to supply Insitu, a major drone manufacturer, with a new unmanned aerial engine. The compnay plans to move into an existing facility within six months, probably in the Washington town of Bingen where Insitu is headquartered. Bingen is next to White Salmon, across the river from Hood River, Oregon. Orbital will initially bring about 15 jobs to the area, with more expected later. Orbital has been working with Insitu for four years on a new propulsion system for Insitu’s ScanEagle UAV, a long-endurance drone that features a sophisticated digital imaging system. It’s used extensively by the U.S military for surveillance in combat zones such as Afghanistan and Iraq.

By KristianoAng The stuff that Hollywood dreams are made of come from a workshop in Oklahoma. It took six artisans and some very high-tech machines in a factory in Grove, Okla. to produce 100 statuettes for this weekend’s Golden Globes ceremony. Since 2009, the Golden Globes statuette has been produced by Society Awards, the New York trophy designer and manufacturer. While the company had originally manufactured at a workshop in its Long Island City headquarters, it recently shifted production to a five-acre facility in Grove after outgrowing its former space. Society Awards is the brainchild of David Moritz, an Oklahoma high school kid who fled to the bright lights of the big city to attend college in New York. A trained attorney, the 35-year-old Moritz, set up the company in 2007 after noticing a gap in the market for high-end trophy producers. Society Awards has also made trophies for the MTV VIA, +1.30%  Video Music Awards, the Clio Awards for advertising professionals and Boeing Co. BA, +0.34%   You can pick up a replica trophy on Amazon for as little as $4, but Mortiz puts the golden in the globes. He spent two years working with the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, the Golden Globes’ organizer, tweaking the statuette design. Its artisans are all college-educated, many with electronic engineering degrees. And he won’t disclose the unit price of each Golden Globe, but experts ballpark the cost at around $800 each. “You need to be happy to work with your hands but also have the education to use the software,” says Moritz, who moved production to Grove partly because there were more skilled laborers there. The Golden Globe statuettes are made of marble and zinc and covered in real gold. Society Awards won’t make unauthorized replicas, but for a trophy of similar quality, the company sources Eastern European marble, which is then hand cut and polished. The zinc metal globe on the statuette is run through an industrial die casting process typically reserved for engine parts. It is then hand finished and electroplated with gold. Industry sources say they can spend 12 to 20 man hours making trophies as intricate as the Golden Globe and Oscar statuettes. How credit scores predict what you will buy next(2:22) For decades, FICO has used big data and mathematical algorithms to calculate people's three-digit credit scores. Now it's using the same technology to predict whether a consumer's likely to buy a product in-store or click on a link online. Even after the trophies are shipped to California, Society Awards will see them again. When Jennifer Lawrence and Leonardo DiCaprio won their respective Golden Globes last year, the awards didn’t come with their names engraved. To personalize the 10.5 inch-high, roughly six pounds-heavy statuette, the owners had to temporarily return them to Society Awards. Society Awards, which makes approximately 100,000 trophies annually, is one of a few specialty manufacturers whose products line the glass cabinets of Hollywood royalty and big-shot executives. The Oscars are made by Polich Tallix Fine Art Foundry, a Rock Tavern, N.Y.-based studio that has worked with art world superstar Jasper Johns. Chicago manufacturer R.S. Owens, which now contracts for the Emmy Awards, crafted the Oscars from 1982 to 2015. Employees do occasionally get to brush up against Tinseltown royalty. While Moritz won’t be at the awards ceremony this Sunday, he has attended past Golden Globe events. “I hope everybody drinks a lot and has a good time, but I really want ‘Deadpool’ to win,” he says.

Post Your Comments Share Cancel | 1 Comments Bullish on growth prospects, budget carrier SpiceJet today said it expects to complete negotiations and place orders for new aircraft this fiscal ending March. The airline, which has been profitable for seven straight quarters after battling financial turbulence, is believed to be looking for around 100 aircraft. "Negotiations are going on for quite some time. We expect to complete these negotiations and place the order this financial year," a SpiceJet spokesperson said in a statement. However, he did not divulge details about the number or type of aircraft that are likely to be ordered. Currently, the airline has 47 aircraft in its fleet comprising 29 Boeing 737s and 18 Bombardier Q400s. In October 2016, SpiceJet Managing Director Ajay Singh had said the airline would not be rushed into a decision on placing order for new aircraft and emphasised that it has to be done at right price. "We are going to finalise in a month. It will be either Boeing or Airbus. We will not be rushed into a decision. It will not be mix of both. It has to be done at right price. So, we have to be very careful. We have closed many issues related to aircraft purchase. It could be more than 100 aircraft," he had said. Back in March 2014, SpiceJet had announced an order for 42 Boeing 737 MAX 8 planes under the then ownership of Marans -- who later sold their entire 58.46 percent stake in the airline to Singh in January 2015. For the 2016 July-September quarter, the airline had posted highest-ever quarterly profit of Rs 59 crore. In the year-ago period, the same stood at Rs 29 crore.

News Business US wage growth accelerates but job creation slows as Donald Trump prepares for the presidency President-elect will inherit a solid economy Sho Chandra Friday 6 January 2017 16:18 BST Click to follow The Independent Online Workers construct the viewing stands ahead of Trump's inauguration at the U.S. Capitol in Washington Reuters The US labour market turned in a solid performance at the end of 2016, putting job gains above 2 million for a sixth year as paychecks rose by the most during the current expansion. The 156,000 increase in December payrolls followed a 204,000 rise in November that was bigger than previously estimated, a Labour Department report showed Friday in Washington. The median forecast in a Bloomberg survey of economists called a 175,000 advance. The jobless rate ticked up to 4.7 per cent as the labour force grew, and wages rose 2.9 per cent from December 2015. Worker shortages may become more frequent in the coming year, which means employers could have to give out bigger wage hikes even as hiring cools. That would buoy consumer spending and underscore the case for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates several more times in 2017, as policy makers deem the situation at or close to full employment. Treasuries fell and the dollar strengthened following Friday’s report. Read more Donald Trump threatens Toyota over 'plan to build new plant' in Mexico “It’s a very strong job market overall,” said Scott Brown, Florida-based chief economist for Raymond James Financial Inc., who projected a 155,000 gain in payrolls. “There’s a further tightening in labour market conditions. Wage pressures are certainly building, and we should continue to see further upward pressure this year.” As the Fed looks for signs of faster inflation, wages are showing their fastest gains since the last recession ended. Average hourly earnings advanced by 2.9 per cent over the 12 months ended in December, the most since June 2009, following a 2.5 per cent boost the prior month. Compared with November, worker pay increased 0.4 per cent. “That’s a very decent report,” Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester told Fox Business Network in an interview after the report was released. “We’re basically at full employment.” The December results were helped by more hiring in healthcare and social assistance, whose gain of 63,300 workers was the most since October 2015. Factories added employees, along with leisure and hospitality businesses. Revisions to prior reports added a total of 19,000 jobs to payrolls in the previous two months. The latest payrolls tally brought the advance for 2016 to 2.16 million, after a gain of about 2.7 million in 2015. The streak of gains above 2 million is the longest since 1999, when Bill Clinton was president. December payroll estimates of economists surveyed by Bloomberg ranged from gains of 125,000 to 221,000. November was initially reported as a 178,000 increase.

The jobless rate matched the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey. Also on Friday, the Labour Department released revisions dating back to 2012 for data from the household survey, including the unemployment rate. October’s rate was revised to 4.8 per cent from 4.9 per cent and September’s was lowered to 4.9 per cent from 5 per cent. Payroll figures from the survey of employers will be revised when the January data are released next month. Among the details of the December report, the participation rate, which shows the share of working-age people in the labour force, increased to 62.7 per cent, from 62.6 per cent. It has been hovering close to the lowest level in more than three decades. Private employment, which excludes government agencies, rose by 144,000 after a 198,000 increase the prior month. Government employment rose by 12,000.

Getty 31/31 Philip Hammond ditches George Osborne's 15% corporation tax cut target - Monday October 3 Chancellor Philip Hammond has apparently rejected the plan of his predecessor George Osborne to slash corporation tax to just 15 per cent in the wake of the UK’s Brexit vote. In early July Mr Osborne said he wanted to push the levy on company profits to 15 per cent as a bold signal to global companies that the UK is still “open for business” despite the vote to leave the EU. In his speech to the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham today, Mr Hammond made no reference to that 15 per cent goal, merely referencing the existing policy for the levy to decline to 17 per cent. AFP/Getty Factory payrolls gained by 17,000, after a 7,000 decline in the previous month. Compared with manufacturers, service providers including restaurants, business services and health-care providers are typically less exposed to headwinds such as the stronger dollar and overseas economies. Retailers increased payrolls by 6,300. Employment in leisure and hospitality rose by 24,000. Barclays  economists Rob Martin and Michael Gapen found the employment figures to be “somewhat softer than we had anticipated,” owing to “tepid” growth in services employment. They cited a slowdown in retail and business and professional services, and declines in temporary help and department stores. The average work week for all workers was unchanged at 34.3 hours. Some measures of labour-market slack showed improvement. Americans who are working part time though would rather have a full-time position, or the measure known as part time for economic reasons, fell to 5.6 million. The underemployment rate, which includes part-time workers who’d prefer a full-time position and people who want to work but have given up looking, dropped to 9.2 per cent from 9.3 per cent. At the Fed’s December meeting, where the central bank raised interest rates by a quarter per centage point, officials noted that the job market had improved appreciably over the past year and slack had declined. Most participants viewed the cumulative progress as “having brought labour market conditions to or close to those consistent with the Committee’s maximum-employment objective,” according to minutes of the session, released Wednesday. “We expect unemployment will keep falling and wage gains will continue to accelerate in the year ahead, putting pressure on the Fed to keep tightening,” Jim O’Sullivan, chief US economist at High Frequency Economics in Valhalla, New York, said in a note. The acceleration in worker pay may have, in part, reflected the unwinding of a calendar quirk that subdued the November tally. Because the 15th of the month fell within the employment survey week, increases in bi-monthly pay are more likely to have been captured. The slowdown in payroll gains in December may have resulted from weather effects, judging from data on the number of non-farm workers with a job who didn’t work because of bad weather, according to O’Sullivan.

Shows Good Morning America Good Morning America World News Tonight World News Tonight Nightline Nightline 20/20 20/20 This Week This Week Live Watch Engine Drops From B-52 Bomber in Rural North Dakota By The Associated Press MINOT, N.D.  Jan 6, 2017, 1:11 PM ET 0 Shares Email Star 0 Shares Email The military believes an engine that dropped from a B-52 bomber during a training mission this week in rural North Dakota suffered a "catastrophic failure," disintegrated and fell into a river, Air Force Secretary Deborah Lee James said. An in-flight emergency was declared Wednesday and the crew landed the plane safely, according to Minot Air Force Base. No injuries were reported on the ground or among the plane's five crew members. No weapons were on board, according to the military. A B-52 has eight engines, according to Boeing, the plane's manufacturer. The Air Force said the engine fell in a remote area about 25 miles northeast of the base that's near Minot, a city about 110 miles north of Bismarck. "They do believe at this point that it was really a catastrophic failure of that one engine," James told the Minot Daily News. "Another way of putting that is it disintegrated and then fell out of the aircraft upon disintegration. "They think it's at the bottom of a river, so recovery of that is something we would like to do because that helps in understanding what happened," she said. Dom Christianson, who lives in Upham, told KXMC-TV that he saw several military helicopters flying over the J. Clark Salyer National Wildlife Refuge northeast of Minot. The Souris River runs through the refuge. "Average day until about noon, when we had helicopters flying over town and flying really low out across the refuge out here," he said. "It went on for about four hours." Base spokesman Maj. Jamie Humphries told The Associated Press on Friday that a military team is surveying the area but is hampered by large amounts of snow. Former National Transportation Safety Board chairman and retired Air Force Maj. Gen. Mark Rosenker told KFGO-AM radio that the incident is "absolutely extraordinary." James said there is "zero indication" the engine incident is a widespread problem within the B-52 fleet. "There's no evidence of that. It appears this was a one-off situation, but again I want to emphasize it just happened and it will be fully investigated," James said. The investigation is expected to take months, Air Force officials said. In the meantime, there are no restrictions on the roughly two dozen other bombers at the base, Humphries said. 0 Shares Email Star Comments Engine Drops From B-52 Bomber in Rural North Dakota " Trump Suggests CIA Director 'Leaker' Behind Unsubstantiated Report " Central US Ice Storm Falls Short of Dire Forecasts " Meet Thumbelina, a Tiny Chihuahua Who Weighs Only 1.54 Pounds " 8-Year-Old Battling Cancer Gets Birthday Wish to See Amazon Facility " Twin's Mom Reacts to Emotional Reunion: 'It Didn't Feel Real' " Man Finds Forgotten Lotto Ticket, Wins $1 Million " Newlyweds Nail Iconic 'Dirty Dancing' Routine at Wedding " 2 Women Share How They Collectively Lost 100s of Pounds " Americans Think Obama, Kennedy, Reagan Gave Best Inaugural Speeches " Standing in for the Incoming President and First Lady at Inauguration Rehearsal " Jennifer Holliday Pulls Out of Trump's Inauguration After Backlash President Obama's Inauguration Day Plans " 5 Takeaways From Scathing Department of Justice Report on Chicago Policing " When Working 2 Fast Food Jobs, 16 Hours a Day Still Isn't Enough " Paris Jackson Pleased, 'Surprised' Network Canceled Michael Jackson Episode

Gulliver Business travel Previous Next Latest Gulliver All latest updates Little pascals Plastic planes will allow airlines to increase cabin pressure Jan 6th 2017, 15:19 by A.W. | WASHINGTON, DC Add this article to your reading list by clicking this button Tweet A FELLOW Gulliver, cheery chap that he is, kicked off the new year explaining why 2017 might be even worse for business travellers than the year we have just put behind us. The reasons are largely geopolitical: the fallout from Brexit, the uncertainty surrounding soon-to-be-President Donald Trump, the likely rise in oil prices, the Chinese economic slowdown and the threat of terror. But there’s one trend that could have a pleasant effect on travel, making flying more comfortable despite efforts by airlines to pack passengers in tighter and charge for the most basic amenities. No doubt you’ve beaten me to it: carbon-reinforced plastic composites. Much of the discomfort of flying—whether reclining in a private first-class suite or jammed into coach—comes from two factors: air pressure and humidity. At 35,000 feet, the air pressure outside an aeroplane is extremely low, so the cabin is pressurised to bring it to a level closer to what we experience on the ground. The trouble is that raising it all the way to sea-level pressure would put tremendous strain on the body of the plane, which would have to contend with the sharply contrasting PSIs on the inside and outside. And so most airliners maintain a cabin pressure equivalent to the one we experience at 8,000 feet above sea level. That is approximately the elevation in Bogota, Colombia or Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. As anyone who has visited the Andes or the east African highlands knows, spending time there is exhausting for those not accustomed to the thinner air. Your lungs and heart have to work harder to deliver oxygen to your body and brain. One reason that marathon winners tend to come from east African countries such as Ethiopia is that their hearts and lungs have grown stronger from training at that altitude. Flying is a considerably more sedentary activity, but as George Hobica explains on his Airfarewatchdog blog, altitude can also interfere with sleep and cause exhaustion while flying. This is where those carbon-reinforced plastic composites come in. The aluminum bodies of most existing planes would struggle to withstand the larger pressure differential that would come from bringing cabin pressure below the 8,000-foot level. But new aircraft are being built with these stronger composites. The Boeing 787 Dreamliner, for example, is constructed with such plastic and features a cabin pressure equivalent to 6,000 feet. A study conducted in coordination with Boeing found that while flying at 8,000 feet can cause a 4% decline in blood oxygen, flying at 6,000 feet is similar to being on the ground, in terms of the effects on passengers’ bodies. Now, on to humidity. Air passengers generate quite a bit of water vapour by exhaling and perspiring, but planes expel much of it in order to maintain a certain humidity level. The problem is that metal aeroplane frames corrode if there is too much humidity, so planes generally have a level that is optimal for them, not for passengers. That can lead to dry eyes and throats. Again, enter those carbon-reinforced plastic composites. As a Boeing representative told Hobica, “Carbon fibre doesn’t care if it gets wet.” Like the Boeing 787, the Airbus A350 features a composite plastic frame with a cabin pressurised to 6,000 feet. Both aircraft are in operation, but in limited numbers. However, as they become more common—according to the respective manufacturers there are currently 810 orders for the A350 and 1,210 for the 787—and as other models follow suit, cabins with more pleasant pressure and humidity levels will become the norm. Even planes with metal frames could adopt these changes: Boeing claims that the durable fuselage on its 777X, set to enter operation in 2019, will also be able to handle a lower cabin altitude. In other words, with each successive year, flyers’ likelihood of suffering fatigue, sleeplessness, scratchy throats and eyes, and the jet lag to which these symptoms contribute will diminish. Unfortunately, carbon-reinforced plastic composites can’t do much to shorten airport lines, restore complimentary bag check or raise the value of the pound.  Previous Flying solo together: Virtual-reality headsets on planes mean we can isolate ourselves from irritating cabin-mates Next The weigh forward: MasterCard could estimate passengers’ weight for airlines based on what they buy Tweet Submit to reddit View all comments (27)Add your comment Comment (27) Timekeeper reading list Reprints & permissions Print About Gulliver Our correspondents inform and entertain business travellers with news and views to help them make the most of life on the road Follow us on Twitter @EconBizTravel RSS feed Advertisement Doing business in Follow The Economist Facebook Twitter Linked in Google plus Tumblr Instagram YouTube RSS Newsletters Latest updates » Special no more: An end to wet foot, dry foot The Americas 3 hrs 2 mins ago The faith of Barack Obama: A president with a feel for the spiritual who...

Competition heats up for Google's Lunar X Prize. The United States is supposed to be a government of laws, not of edicts. Yet Trump’s tweets are gaining power even though they aren’t legislation, argues public policy expert Robert Reich. By Robert Reich, Robertreich.org January 6, 2017 Save for later Saved In this Dec. 28, 2016 photo, President-elect Donald Trump listens to a question as he speaks to reporters at Mar-a-Lago, in Palm Beach, Fla. AP Photo/Evan Vucci, File View Caption About video ads View Caption of Trump’s tweets are a new form of governing by edict. They’re tweedicts. Incoming White House press secretary Sean Spicer says “Whatever he tweets, he is going to drive the news.” That’s the problem. In driving the news, Trump’s tweedicts gain the power of  implied threats – that he’ll, for example, sanction a particular company (Ford, General Motors, Carrier, or Boeing); unilaterally alter foreign policy (recognize Taiwan, encourage Israel to expand on the West Bank, not back NATO against Russian aggression); unleash his angry followers on a particular critic  (a local union leader in Michigan, a teenage girl in New Hampshire, a TV news host); cause customers or readers to boycott a media outlet (CNN, the Arizona Republican, Saturday Night Live, the cast of Hamilton); or impose high political costs on Republican members of Congress (for pursuing an investigation against Russia, gutting an ethics office). Recommended: How 17 famous tech companies got their names  They aren’t executive orders (which can be reviewed and overturned by courts). They aren’t even the statements of a president using his “bully pulpit” to make a general point, because they single out particular companies and people.  How 17 famous tech companies got their names Photos of the Day Photos of the weekend They are arbitrary and capricious, reflecting the daily whims of Donald Trump.  And he’s not even president yet.  The media argue that the thoughts of a president-elect are “inherently newsworthy.” Rubbish.

News Business Business News UK productivity growth still well below pre-financial crisis levels British workers are far less efficient than their French and German counterparts and the problem isn't getting any better Ben Chapman Friday 6 January 2017 14:37 BST Click to follow The Independent Online Manufacturing has experienced a particularly marked decline in productivity growth Reuters UK productivity growth remained well below its pre-financial crisis levels in the three months following June’s Brexit vote, new official figures show. The amount each UK worker produces is falling further behind other advanced economies and the country has “a lot of catching up to do”, economists said Productivity growth is crucial to raising living standards and has been particularly weak since the 2008-9 recession. The figure rose by an annualised rate of 0.4 per cent in the three months to September 2016 – far below its average of 2.1 per cent for the decade before 2008. The malaise is particularly acute in manufacturing which had been growing at 4.3 per cent a year, but is now at just 0.8 per cent. Read more Industrial production falls at fastest pace in four years The Office for National Statistics said British workers are producing 15.5 per cent less than they would have been if productivity growth had returned to its pre-crisis trend. Andy Haldane, the Bank of England’s chief economist, said on Thursday that more than three quarters of firms are not becoming any more productive at all. Raising productivity is vital as the UK enters an uncertain economic future amid Brexit negotiations, according to Howard Archer, chief UK and European economist at IHS Global Insight. The UK lags behind most other advanced economies on this measure and has “a lot of catching up to do”, he said. “Part of the UK’s recent poor labour productivity performance has been due to the fact that employment held up well during the downturn and then picked up markedly,” he explained.

Getty 31/31 Philip Hammond ditches George Osborne's 15% corporation tax cut target - Monday October 3 Chancellor Philip Hammond has apparently rejected the plan of his predecessor George Osborne to slash corporation tax to just 15 per cent in the wake of the UK’s Brexit vote. In early July Mr Osborne said he wanted to push the levy on company profits to 15 per cent as a bold signal to global companies that the UK is still “open for business” despite the vote to leave the EU. In his speech to the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham today, Mr Hammond made no reference to that 15 per cent goal, merely referencing the existing policy for the levy to decline to 17 per cent. AFP/Getty “Low wage growth increased the attractiveness of employment for companies. This meant that it was easier for companies to hold on to workers even when they did not really need them in order to retain their experience and knowledge. “A major risk now is that prolonged uncertainty and concerns over the UK’s economic outlook ends up weighing down markedly on business investment and damages productivity. This could be compounded if foreign companies reduce their investment in the UK and this dilutes any beneficial spill-over of skills and knowledge.” In November’s Autumn statement, Philip Hammond pledged to spend £23bn tackling the problem. Explanations for weak productivity vary. Highly productive sectors such as financial services and oil and gas contracted after the financial crisis and there has been rapid growth in low-skilled, low-paid jobs. Low public infrastructure investment and a patchy education system that has produced weak results for poorer and less able pupils have also been blamed. Future restrictions on migration and an increased regulatory burden when trading with Europe as a non-EU nation are both predicted to damage productivity growth. “As we leave the EU, the country needs to work harder than ever to demonstrate our doors remain open to the world,” said Yael Selfin, an economist at accountants KPMG.

During the campaign, Deerfield-based Mondelez International Inc., the owner of the iconic cookie brand, was one of the companies that President-elect Donald Trump railed against for sending jobs overseas, alongside the likes of Ford, Carrier and Boeing. But while those other three have already had postelection run-ins with Trump in one fashion or another -- triggering wild stock gyrations and corporate pledges to rework investment plans -- Mondelez curiously has not. Given the president-elect's current tweeting pace, it feels like it's just a matter of time before the company comes back under scrutiny. Mondelez wasn't interested in discussing its game plan for when that moment comes, but experts said it undoubtedly has scrambled to prepare a rapid-fire response. "The last thing they want to do is have a brand out there being attacked," said Richard Frisch, a crisis-communications consultant. "There's no question they have a crisis plan in place." The stakes are high. Last month, when Trump wrote on Twitter that the costs of the F-35 program were "out of control," shares of defense manufacturer Lockheed Martin Corp. tanked, wiping out almost $2 billion in market share. "We've never had a president-elect who could move stocks at will," said Richard Levick, founder of the communications firm that bears his name. "A Trump tweet rates among the top risks of the year." When a company makes nice, on the other hand, it can be rewarded. Ford's stock rose nearly 4 percent after it announced it was canceling a $1.6 billion Mexican expansion. Hope Hicks, a spokeswoman for Trump, didn't respond to a request for comment. Mondelez first drew Trump's ire back in August 2015, when he claimed that the company was eliminating 1,200 jobs in the U.S. as it moved Oreo production to Mexico. "I'll never eat them again," Trump vowed. His assertion wasn't quite true. The global snack giant had decided to invest $130 million in an existing plant to south of the border to upgrade cookie and cracker production, rather than putting the money into a factory in Chicago. The move eliminated 600 positions, though Oreos are still produced at three domestic facilities. Democratic candidates Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton soon jumped on, too, and The Late Show's Stephen Colbert mocked Trump's vow not to eat Oreos by shoveling them into his mouth one night. But the controversy eventually faded into the background. Mondelez said it has invested about $450 million in U.S. manufacturing facilities since 2012, when the company split from Kraft Foods. "We continue to make investments where it makes sense and that includes the United States," said Laurie Guzzinati, a spokeswoman for the snack maker. She said the company hasn't heard from the incoming administration. Mondelez might be better positioned than, say, Boeing or Ford, to resist the pressure of a Trump tweet. It isn't a big government contractor -- making planes for the military, for instance -- and getting consumers to boycott a favorite snack is difficult. That could weaken Trump's ability to have a lasting negative impact on the $26.5 billion company, according to Frisch. Still, that may be little comfort. Large food companies tend to be conservative, perpetually seeking to stay away from controversy, particularly of the political variety. And in this unprecedented atmosphere, where the next squabble with the federal government is seemingly just a click away, Mondelez executives are hoping to avoid the glare of Trump's aggressive Twitter persona. "If you're Mondelez," said Tim Calkins, a marketing professor at Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management, "the last thing you want is to be a target of Donald Trump."

ETF News Best ETFs Top Rated ETFs Best ETF Categories ETF Screener Tools ETF Screener Find Whats In Your ETF Find What ETFs Hold Your Stock Find ETFs By Leverage Find ETFs By Asset Class Free Newsletter Search Here’s How Gold Fared Against Major Currencies In 2016 January 6, 2017 9:11am NYSE:GLD ShareTweet From GoldCore: Gold was the best performing currency in 2016, rising as it did in all major currencies. It again performed the function as a hedge against currency devaluation and this was seen particularly in sterling terms with gold rising 31.5% in British pounds after the Brexit shock. Gold in USD in 2016 Gold prices closed 2016 at USD 1,159.10, EUR 1,098.36 and GBP 942.58 per ounce. Gold prices closed 2015 at USD 1,062.25, EUR 974.32 and GBP 716.36 per ounce. (Gold AM fixes on December 30th 2016 and December 31st 2015 respectively) UK investors and savers who had an allocation to gold protected their wealth from the Brexit debacle and the sharp falls in sterling seen in its aftermath. Gold rose over £220 per ounce and acted as a classic safe haven for investors exposed to the pound, and markets and assets denominated in British pounds. Gold in GBP in 2016 The gains in euro terms were more modest but robust. The gains seen are likely due to the continuing massive ECB money printing and debt monetisation programme and heightened risk of contagion in the Eurozone. Brexit and the elections in France, Germany and Holland will support gold in euro terms in 2017 and there is the possibility of sharp gains in euro terms should the Eurozone debt crisis return. Gold in EUR in 2016 What drivers will gold respond to in 2017? Italian, Greek, Irish, Spanish and other banks and risk of bail-ins Dutch, German, French elections … Eurozone contagion Continuing ultra loose monetary policies by Fed, BOE, BOJ and especially ECB Trump policies and tweets … Geo-politics, cyber war & terrorism, conventional war & terrorism President Trump has already shown himself as a man who likes to tweet and knows the power of the short sound bite and the medium that is Twitter. His skill in this regard was one of the factors which helped him become President. However, this asset may become a liability for him and for markets when he becomes President. The art of diplomacy will become more important and 140 characters of unfiltered Trump is likely to create tensions with America’s largest trading partners such as China. This has been seen with China recently and his accusation that China “stole” the U.S. drone on Twitter. It has already impacted markets as seen when he tweeted about Boeing and Boeing shares fell sharply. Should he continue in this vein, it could lead to jitters in markets and a safe haven bid for gold in the event of ‘inflammatory’, tension creating and damaging tweets. His capacity to comment without fully understanding all the facts may be his ‘Achilles heal’ in this regard. Overnight Trump’s tweet regarding Toyota saw the Japanese car maker lose $1.2 billion in value in five minutes. Shares plummeted after the president-elect vowed in a tweet to stop the car manufacturer from moving abroad. Stocks, bonds and property markets have performed very well in recent years. However, there gains are artificial and are based on near zero percent interest rate policies and from being bloated by monetary stimulus on a scale that the world has never seen before. These bubble like conditions look increasingly vulnerable and will likely burst – the question is when rather than if. Indeed, the turmoil that we have seen on international markets in 2016 appears a foretaste of a very volatile 2017. We continue to see conditions akin to those seen in 2007 and 2008. Many leading experts have echoed these concerns. Geopolitical risk intensified in 2016 with Brexit, the Italian referendum and of course the election of Trump. The risk of terrorism and war remain ever present and gold will continue to act as an important hedge against geopolitical risk. The risk of contagion in the EU – both political and financial and monetary now looms large. Today there is the added risk of bail-ins and deposit confiscation which will be see savings and capital confiscated from savers and companies in the next financial crisis. Conclusion It is worth remembering – as many seem to have forgotten – that gold was one of the few assets to rise in the financial crash of 2008 and in the debt crisis in the 2007 to 2012 period. It has under performed since as stocks and bonds roared to artificially induced record highs. The strong performance of gold in all currencies including the very strong dollar in 2016 bodes well for 2017. It is due a period of out performance and we believe it will outperform other assets in the coming Trump Presidency years from 2017 to 2020.

Top US firms such as Emerson, CME Group, 3M Company, Varian Medical, Dell, Boeing, BIO, Lockheed Martin, FedEx, Gilead, Huntsman Corporation and MasterCard, who are member companies of the US-India Business Council (USIBC), will participate in the summit to be inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on January 10.

And even before taking office, he seems to be trying to do that using his favorite weapon: Twitter. He has publicly attacked and tried to shame numerous companies in the last one month, referring to negotiations regarding their plans to open plants in or move jobs to other countries, on his Twitter account. The list includes air conditioner manufacturer Carrier, air plane makers Boeing and Lockheed Martin, as well as automaker General Motors. He also routinely targeted Ford Motor while on the campaign trail. And in a tweet Thursday, Trump picked on another automaker, this time a non-U.S. company. Related Stories Ford Cancels $1.6 Billion Plant, Pledges Domestic Investment Trump Tweet Sends GM Shares Down Toyota Motor Corp., the world’s largest automaker, has manufacturing plants in many places across the world. Its vehicles made in Mexico account for less than 10 percent of its sales in the U.S., according to estimates. Along with other Japanese car manufacturers — Honda, Mazda and Nissan — it produced about 1.4 million vehicles in Mexico in the financial year ended March 2016, and production is planned to be ramped up to 1.9 million vehicles by 2019, according to Japan External Trade Organization. However, the total production in Mexico is only a fraction of the number of cars the same companies produce in the U.S. The top three Japanese automakers produced about 4 million vehicles in the U.S. in 2015, Reuters reported. And according to estimates by JP Morgan, an increase in tariffs on cars imported from Mexico will have an impact of only about 0.7 percent on the operating profit of Toyota. None of the Japanese automakers have any plans to change their operations, at least as of now. But the stock market still punished Toyota, whose shares dropped 1.69 percent on the Tokyo Stock Exchange during Friday trade. Its ADR shares traded on the New York Stock Exchange were lower by 0.57 percent during trade Thursday and fell another 0.42 percent after hours.

The president-elect’s followers include many who distrust both main parties and, if handed a pitchfork, might skewer half the Republicans in Congress. Undaunted, party bigwigs and intellectuals have begun making the case that, for all its rough edges, “Trumpism” is a recognisably conservative way of viewing the world, with the potential to rescue swathes of America from feelings of abandonment and despair, securing majorities for Republicans for years to come. Republican leaders who clashed with Mr Trump during the election campaign now urge colleagues to see his victory as a lesson in humility. After the new Congress was sworn in on January 3rd Paul Ryan, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, told members that for too long leaders in Washington had treated complaints about closed factories with “condescension”. Now Americans had let out a “great roar”, Mr Ryan continued: they have given Republicans control of Congress and the White House not as an act of generosity but as a demand for “results”. Embracing the results sought by Trumpism will not be easy for convinced free-marketeers such as Mr Ryan. On the day that Congress returned to work, Ford announced that it is cancelling plans for a $1.6bn plant in Mexico and will create 700 jobs in Michigan building electric vehicles. This follows months of public browbeating by Mr Trump, including threats of punitive tariffs on firms making things abroad—though Ford’s chief executive cast the decision to invest in America as a vote of confidence in “pro-growth” policies outlined by the president-elect. Ford joins Carrier, Lockheed Martin and Boeing as companies that have changed investment or pricing decisions after Trumpian arm-twisting (hailing Carrier’s climb-down, eased by tax breaks from the state of Indiana, Mr Trump declared that the free market had failed American workers “every time”). As Mitt Romney’s vice-presidential running-mate in 2012, Mr Ryan scorned the idea of governments picking “winners and losers”. Today the Speaker talks up the prospects of tax reforms and deregulation giving all companies good cause to stay in America. Other conservative grandees wonder if a dose of economic nationalism is the price of solidifying the coalition that carried Mr Trump to power, including blue-collar voters in the Midwest who abandoned the Democrats in droves. They praise Mr Trump as a patriot-pragmatist in the spirit of Lincoln or Theodore Roosevelt. They are slower to note more recent models for Trumpism, starting with populist-nationalist movements sweeping Europe. Parallels with Nicolas Sarkozy, France’s centre-right president from 2007-12 and a hyperactive corporatist, are startling. Mr Sarkozy denounced French carmakers for producing cars in eastern Europe (“not justifiable”, he growled), and rushed to a steelworks to promise workers he would save their jobs (a pledge he could not keep). Hugh Hewitt, a conservative talk-radio host, this month will publish “The Fourth Way”, a book-length guide to how Trumpism might advance bits of the Reagan agenda, by promoting conservative judges, stronger armed forces (Mr Hewitt likes Mr Trump’s talk of a 350-ship navy) and free enterprise (above all rolling back “the vast and growing regulatory state”). To that he would add a “repatriation window” for corporate profits held abroad, and a new, voter-pleasing wave of infrastructure projects, including reopened shipyards, modernised airports, local sports facilities and other visible signs of Trumpian largesse. Billions would be disbursed by temporary, county-level commissions appointed by Congress and the White House (“the patronage!” sighs Mr Hewitt) and as classic pork-barrel spending by members of Congress. To break the partisan stalemate over immigration Mr Hewitt would have Mr Trump lay out detailed plans for a double-row border fence along the southern border, which when half- or three-quarters built would trigger a legalisation programme for most of the 11m immigrants in America without the right papers. Get all this right, Mr Hewitt says, and Mr Trump can realign national politics. Get it wrong and Mr Trump could face “catastrophic” midterm elections in 2018, a primary challenger in 2020 or, if embroiled in scandals, impeachment. Seeking Mr Trump’s inner Reagan In the spring Newt Gingrich, a former Speaker and adviser to Mr Trump, will publish “Understanding Trump.” He calls the president-elect the third attempt, after Reagan’s election in 1980 and his own Contract with America in 1994, to break free from the big-government mindset of Franklin Roosevelt’s New Deal. To square that claim with Mr Trump’s free-spending, distinctly statist campaign promises, Mr Gingrich portrays the businessman as a disruptive innovator, using social media and a genius for publicity to win a presidential election on the cheap. That thriftiness, also displayed in Mr Trump’s business life, tells Mr Gingrich that President Trump will run a lean federal bureaucracy, root out waste and generally “kick over the table”. Pondering Mr Trump’s desire for better relations with Russia, Mr Gingrich has called its president, Vladimir Putin, “a thug” but at the same time scolded Republicans who treat Russia as if it were still the Soviet Union, rather than a competitor that needs dealing with “as it is”. Some conservative enthusiasm for Trumpism reflects a sincere desire to grapple with voter angst. Some is born of opportunism and fear that the next president will set his voters on Republicans who defy him. Yet Mr Trump will need allies in Congress, too, if he is to rack up achievements to impress supporters. Trumpism, born as a populist revolt, must become a programme for government. That’s harder than leading a parade. twitter icon facebook icon more iconMore linkedin icon googleplus icon mail icon print icon purchase-rights icon Be the first to comment Editors’ picks Manufacturing industryPoliticians cannot bring back old-fashioned factory jobs They don’t make ’em like that any more Non-stick NarendraIndia’s prime minister has a knack for shrugging off embarrassmentAsia Battling for survivalThe French left faces a grim election yearEurope A walk across WashingtonA tour of a changing capitalCulture Latest Updates Special no moreAn end to wet foot, dry foot Americas The faith of Barack ObamaA president with a feel for the spiritual who was hated by the pious Erasmus Police forceChicago’s police regularly use excessive force, says the Department of Justice Democracy in America The ElbphilharmonieA new concert hall is worth the wait, and the cost, for Hamburg Daily chartThe curious case of high blood pressure around the world Graphic detail England’s National Health ServiceNo more money for the NHS, says Philip Hammond Britain Something nasty from the tail pipeAmerican regulators accuse Fiat Chrysler of emissions cheating Business and finance Pistols at 30,000 feetThousands of flyers have been caught trying to smuggle loaded guns onto American planes Gulliver Podcast: The week aheadHacks, leaks and videotape International Swimming together, living togetherThe meaning of a European court verdict on Muslim girls and school swimming lessons Erasmus The Netanyahu tapesA new scandal rocks Israel’s prime minister Middle East and Africa The Economist explainsWhy Indonesia is unlikely to ban booze The Economist explains Global exchange rates, to goThe Big Mac index Graphic detail Special educationThe Supreme Court considers what states owe to disabled students Democracy in America Daily chartHuman and pet health-cost trends are strikingly similar Graphic detail Contracts in American footballHow to lose quarterbacks and alienate people Game theory Resurrecting JFKNew York’s airports may finally be upgraded Gulliver Podcast: The Economist asksShould education last a lifetime?

The free Trigger app will enable users to set up notifications for Mr Trump’s tweets, allowing investors to keep a close eye on stocks in real time. The company said it had rolled out the new feature because of the incoming President’s potential to “eradicate billions of dollars in market cap from large companies”. Watch | Bernie Sanders prints out giant poster of Trump tweet 00:30 The impact of Mr Trump’s social media activity was made clear last month when he sent the share price of manufacturer Boeing tumbling after posting a tweet that called for a multi-billion dollar order for a new Air Force One plane to be scrapped. He has also tweeted about a string of other companies, including urging a boycott of Apple products last year. Just this week Mr Trump used the social media site to attack General Motors, suggesting it was sending its “Mexican-made model of Chevy Cruze to US car dealers tax free across border [sic]”. General Motors is sending Mexican made model of Chevy Cruze to U.S. car dealers-tax free across border. Make in U.S.A.or pay big border tax!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 3, 2017 Within hours rival car giant Ford had cancelled plans to build a new $1.6bn plant in Mexico, saying it would instead invest $700m in a manufacturing base in Michigan. “These triggers can help you capture moves or manage your holdings based on the market’s reaction to the future President’s remarks,” Trigger wrote on its blog. “While it’s no surprise that Trump has been actively tweeting since the election, no one anticipated that a single tweet could potentially eradicate billions of dollars in market cap from large companies. “His tweets on prices and contracts with public companies have had significant market-moving events that make it more difficult for the everyday investor to stay on top of their investments.” Donald Trumps team The app allows users to set a variety of other triggers, such as a reminder to sell a stock when it reaches a certain price, or hits a one-year high or low.

Trump told a friend in the last few weeks that he still considers the merger to be a bad deal, said one of the people, who asked not to be identified because the conversation was private. Trump’s chief strategist, Steve Bannon, is also opposed to the deal, another person said. While Trump blasted the deal during the campaign, Time Warner shares have climbed 10 per cent since the election on speculation that a Republican administration would be friendlier to the US$85.4 billion (RM382 billion) merger. The stock closed Wednesday at US$96.71, compared with AT&T’s offer price of US$107.50 a share. Time Warner shares dropped as much as 3.8 per cent yesterday after Bloomberg’s report on Trump’s thinking about the transaction. Hope Hicks, a spokeswoman for Trump, didn’t respond to a request for comment. AT&T and Time Warner both declined to comment. Trump’s opposition to the deal is “mildly negative,” but everything is negotiable with the president-elect, Cowen & Co analyst Paul Gallant said Thursday in a note to clients. The review process is still in the very early stages, he said. Limited options It remains unclear whether Trump would try to influence the regulatory review of the merger, either by pushing officials to impose conditions or to block the deal entirely. The transaction, which would combine the biggest U.S. pay-TV and internet provider with one of the largest creators of TV programming, will be reviewed by the Justice Department and possibly by the Federal Communications Commission. Trump, who takes office Jan 20, has nominated Senator Jeff Sessions, an Alabama Republican, to lead the Justice Department, and hasn’t named a successor to departing FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler. In October, before the election, Trump said his administration wouldn’t approve the merger, saying, “It’s too much concentration of power in the hands of too few.” He cited the deal as “an example of the power structure I’m fighting.” Trump has said little publicly about the deal since, but has taken on several major corporations in recent weeks after winning the election, including Ford Motor Co, Carrier and Boeing Co. If Trump wants to influence the review, he would have more success with the FCC, which weighs deals based on a more subjective public-interest standard, said Craig Moffett, an analyst at MoffettNathanson. In 2014, for instance, President Obama issued a statement and video urging the commission to impose stronger regulations on high-speed Internet service to protect “net neutrality,” which the agency later did. “If the FCC takes the case, President Trump could influence the decision in any number of ways,” Moffett said. “He can effectively turn up the heat and make it very difficult for the FCC to disagree with him.” AT&T, however, could avoid a FCC review by divesting licenses owned by Time Warner, Moffett said. Trump would have a harder time influencing the Justice Department review of the deal, because any decision the agency makes can be challenged in court, Moffett said. “It would be naive to say DOJ operates utterly without political intervention,” he said, “but the potential for partisan meddling is much lower at DOJ than at FCC.” Trump’s opinion is unlikely to lead to the merger being blocked unless the president chooses to get heavily involved in the approval process, said Barry Diller, a media veteran who’s now chairman of IAC/InterActiveCorp. “Unless he’s going to micromanage and now he’s going to be head of antitrust and go through the whole legal process, he’s just doing what he does,” Diller said in an interview Thursday on Bloomberg Television. CNN frustration Trump’s opposition to the AT&T-Time Warner deal stems partly from his frustration with CNN, which is owned by Time Warner, one of the people said. Trump has repeatedly criticised the cable news network for what he sees as unfair coverage of him. AT&T could sell CNN to appease Trump and get the deal approved, Moffett said. “If that’s the primary concern, you’d have to wonder whether AT&T wouldn’t prefer to sell CNN for Trump to claim victory and still get this deal across the finish line,” Moffett said. Trump is also frustrated with Comcast Corp, which in 2011 bought NBCUniversal in a similar deal that was cleared with conditions. Trump is upset with Comcast and NBC because he sees them as being responsible for the October leak of a 2005 “Access Hollywood” video in which he made degrading comments about women, the person said. Trump sees himself as a victim of a concentrated media landscape, the person said. In the coming months, federal regulators will scrutinize the deal, which would create a telecommunications and media empire that will own much of the programming it provides to subscribers of its wireless, internet and pay-TV services. AT&T serves 133 million US wireless customers and 25 million video subscribers. During a congressional hearing last month, the chief executives of AT&T and Time Warner defended their transaction, arguing that it would raise a challenge to cable companies by making it easier to create new online TV packages and help them compete with tech giants in online advertising, among other benefits. That same month, AT&T Chief Executive Officer Randall Stephenson said at an investor conference that the regulatory review of the deal “should be fairly straightforward” and “based on the facts of the law, we expect a good outcome from that.” He said AT&T was open to conditions to get the deal approved but said “it’s too early to tell” whether AT&T would divest Time Warner’s licences to avoid an FCC review. — Bloomberg                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week World’s eight richest as wealthy as half of humanity, Oxfam tells Davos Trump threatens BMW with border tax on cars built in Mexico Sterling hammered on Brexit reports, Asia markets sink Job cuts, fewer flights?

Though we are anxious about the economic and political uncertainties that await the Valley this year, we also recognize that 2016 did not end without its fair share of positive developments and that 2017 does not begin without some room for spillover confidence. From growth in our tech sector to progress in downtown Youngstown redevelopment to a near billion-dollar investment in clean-energy production, the Valley can boast many 2016 assets, some of which are bound to increase in value throughout this new year. Prime among them is America Makes, the National Additive Manufacturing Innovation Institute based in downtown Youngstown. In 2016, it continued to expand as the nation’s leading partner in additive manufacturing and 3-D printing research. Projects in partnership with such blockbuster corporations as General Electric, Honeywell Aerospace and Boeing continued to fuel its growth in 2016. America Makes clearly has established itself as one of the enduring positive legacies of the administration of President Barack Obama, who spearheaded its creation in 2012. Its success should be clearly evident to the incoming administration of Donald Trump, which should continue Uncle Sam’s support and funding. SUCCESS AT YBI Speaking of Youngstown’s growth as a tech hub, the next-door neighbor to America Makes made significant advancements in 2016. The internationally acclaimed Youngstown Business Incubator acquired and began massive renovations of The Vindicator’s former office building for use as a startup center for advanced manufacturing enterprises. Elsewhere downtown, ongoing rejuvenation continued at a brisk pace. Among projects of note included the full opening of the renovated Wick Tower apartment complex, completion of the massive Wells Building renovation and early work to transform The Downtown Circle deli into the downtown’s first full-line grocery store in decades. On tap for construction and completion this year include two significant pieces of downtown reinvention. The NYO Property Group is continuing renovations to the 110-year-old landmark Stambaugh Building into DoubleTree Hotel opening by year’s end. A few blocks down from Central Square, a 3,250-seat amphitheater and a riverfront park are expected to open to complement the Covelli Centre’s increased success in attracting big-name acts and tens of thousands of patrons downtown. Up the street, Youngstown State University enjoyed a banner year as well. For the first time in six years, enrollment increased and the urban college received many prestigious honors, not the least of which is selection of one of its students as a Rhodes Scholar. Physical growth continued with the opening of the University Edge apartment complex with plans on tap for substantially more student housing and retail growth in the university corridor this year. 2016 ended with the university’s football team advancing to the FCS national championship game on Saturday, an apt metaphor for the optimism and positive spirit that pervade YSU as 2017 classes begin. $900 MILLION ENERGY CENTER Elsewhere in the Valley, ground was broken last summer for the $900 million Lordstown Energy Center. The massive project to construct a plant to generate electricity from natural gas will move into high gear this year with approximately 500 workers involved in its construction. The economic impact of that project to the Valley economy over the next 40 years is predicted to be about $14 billion. To be sure, the projects and success stories noted above represent only a partial slice of 2016’s success stories. Others include the growth of downtown Warren’s Tech Belt Energy Innovation Center, renewed excitement at the recently renovated Stambaugh Auditorium, and ongoing commercial growth in the Valley’s largest suburban communities of Boardman and Austintown. In a new year sure to be filled with many uncertainties and challenges, the promise of the plethora of uplifting projects and developments must not be forgotten in our collective community consciousness.

By RobertSchroeder Fiscal policy reporter President-elect Donald Trump threatened Toyota with a border tax if it builds a new plant for cars for the U.S. market in Mexico instead of in the U.S., in his latest Twitter barrage against a major corporation. “No way!” Trump said in a tweet Thursday afternoon. “Build plant in U.S. or pay big border tax.” In his tweet, the president-elect referred to a plant in “Baja, Mexico.” But he appeared to be confusing that location with Guanajuato, Mexico, where the Japanese automaker broke ground on a plant in November of last year. The plant will produce Corollas beginning in 2019, the company said. Toyota Motor said will build a new plant in Baja, Mexico, to build Corolla cars for U.S. NO WAY! Build plant in U.S. or pay big border tax.— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 5, 2017 Shares of Toyota TM, +0.14%   fell about 0.4% after Trump’s tweet. The president-elect has publicly threatened other companies, including Ford F, +0.32%  , Boeing BA, +0.34%   and General Motors GM, -0.45%  . Ford said earlier this week it was scrapping plans for a new $1.6 billion assembly plant in Mexico, and would instead build small cars in an existing Mexican factory, as well as invest $700 million in a facility in Michigan. Read: Opinion: Ford’s Mexico shift shows Trump’s bully pulpit has some value. In a statement, Toyota defended its decision to build the new plant and trumpeted its history in the U.S. “Toyota has been part of the cultural fabric in the U.S. for nearly 60 years,” the statement read. “Production volume or employment in the U.S. will not decrease as a result of our new plant in Guanajuato, Mexico announced in April 2015.” Statement in response to the President Elect's recent comment.

The 29th edition of the show, held in the American car capital, will showcase the increasingly prominent role of digital and electric advances, starting with its unofficial kickoff on Sunday, when Google will showcase a self-driving car partnership with Chrysler. While the show will be looking to the future, prior to the show’s public opening on January 14 many industry insiders likely will be focused on the present, notably the increased uncertainty from an incoming Trump administration. The president-elect has shown a willingness to apply pressure, especially via Twitter, on US manufacturers like Boeing, Carrier, Lockheed, GM and Ford to criticize corporate strategies, especially those involving investment and employment outside the United States. He has vowed to preserve American jobs or bring them back, threatened to impose tariffs on American goods made in Mexico and China, and tear up the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico. NAFTA and the US economy  While the Detroit auto show will be looking to the future, many industry insiders likely will be focused on the increased uncertainty from an incoming Trump administration “We’ve never experienced anything quite like this,” said Alan Deardorff, a professor at the University of Michigan who focuses on international trade policy. Trade deals take years to have an effect as economies adjust, he said, so it is unclear what would happen to the US car industry should those deals be abruptly canceled or changed. “We’ve never gone in this direction, not in recent history,” he said. But he warned one likely outcome is an increase in the car prices, making them less competitive in a global economy. Matt DeLorenzo, who tracks the auto industry for Kelley Blue Book, said US carmakers “will have to reassess their whole Mexico strategy and NAFTA.” An early sign of that reassessment came in dramatic fashion Tuesday when Ford appeared to capitulate to months of Trump’s criticism by scrapping plans to build a $1.6 billion plant in Mexico. Instead it will use $700 million of those funds to expand a Michigan plant, creating 700 new jobs. “It’s literally a vote of confidence around some of the pro-growth policies that (Trump) has been outlining and that’s why we’re making this decision to invest here in the US,” Ford CEO Mark Fields said. Ford has been investing in high-tech, electric vehicle development, and beefing up higher-skilled American manufacturing can help better accomplish that goal, while its cheaper, less technology-laden car models are produced in Mexico. Ford’s decision to cancel plans to build a new factory in Mexico was widely interpreted in Mexico as the result of Donald Trump’s repeated criticism of the $1.6bn project Trump also targeted GM in a tweet Tuesday, threatening to impose a tariff on the car giant’s Mexican-made Chevrolet Cruze cars. GM responded quickly, emphasizing that the vast majority of its US-sold Cruze vehicles are made in Ohio. Despite the rhetoric, the worst fears of what a Trump administration might do in 2017 are unlikely to come to pass, said Christopher Wilson, who studies US-Mexico policy at the Wilson Center, a Washington think tank. “The incoming administration is coming to terms with the reality” of the cross-border car manufacturing process, Wilson said. He warned that there may be other efforts undertaken to address negative effects from globalization, including new tax policies and a renegotiation of NAFTA. “Anything that puts NAFTA at risk, puts the US economy at risk,” he said.  Full automation? Not yet  With those high stakes in play, the auto industry will open the Detroit auto show that this year focuses on autonomous car technologies, amid the usual array of vehicle debuts and demonstrations. The bulk of the show’s more than 300 exhibitors are start-ups boasting new technologies for connected and self-driving cars. Major manufacturers also are in the game. Volkswagen, seeking to turn the page from the diesel emissions scandal that led to a 7.6 percent sales tumble in 2016, plans to unveil an electric, autonomous concept car. Google’s self-driving car subsidiary Waymo will showcase a Chrysler Pacifica minivan outfitted with self-driving technology. “The race has accelerated in the last 12 months between car groups, Silicon Valley giants and consumer electronics groups to be the first in market” with an autonomous car, said Karl Brauer of Kelley Blue Book. Despite that onslaught, analysts say autonomous technology is currently in the early stages, in which human intervention is still required. Volkswagen, seeking to turn the page from a diesel emissions scandal in 2016, plans to unveil an electric, autonomous concept car at the Detroit auto show “Full automation is the ultimate goal, but at the moment, no company has fully autonomous vehicles in production,” Jefferies & Co. tech analyst Brian Fitzgerald said. Michelle Krebs, an industry analyst with AutoTrader, said part of the challenge is overcoming hesitant consumer sentiment, which has been evolving from suspicious to cautious. “There’s going to be a lot of experimentation … in terms of how do we make autonomous available to consumers,” Krebs said. An AutoTrader annual survey of consumer sentiment found shifting attitudes. After initially considering autonomous technologies too dangerous, consumers were becoming more accepting, Krebs said. “Consumers want more and more driver assist technology,” she said, “and they are warming up to the idea of autonomous, fully self-driving” cars. The production of these technology-packed cars will require a highly-skilled workforce. Robert Scott of the Economic Policy Institute said that is an opportunity for American manufacturing to catch up, should policymakers in the Trump administration take steps to invest in labor force training and other services for displaced workers. “They’re going to have to do more than renegotiate NAFTA,” to bring manufacturing jobs back at a large scale, Scott said. -AFP  basil RELATED ARTICLES Entertainment Jazz artist Thandi Klaasen dies aged 86 Entertainment Top DJ David Guetta’s Mumbai concert gets go-ahead Cricket Stubborn Latham keeps New Zealand afloat Comments and Analysis Analysis:Social media threat to democracy Comments and Analysis Opinion: ANC’s soul-searching works NO COMMENTS LEAVE A REPLY Cancel reply You must be logged in to post a comment.

CNN Money China fears protectionist Trump may thwart its exports China's customs agency said on Friday U.S. President Donald Trump may limit the growth of China's exports by imposing greater trade protectionist measures. According to Reuters, customs spokesman Huang Songping said China is the biggest loser in the anti-globalization trend. He added it will be difficult for China's foreign trade to improve in 2017 due to rising costs and other factors. China is the world's largest trading nation. It could be heavily exposed to protectionist measures this year if Trump follows through on campaign pledges to brand it a currency manipulator and impose heavy tariffs on imports of Chinese goods.

Its strength will hurt U.S. manufacturing while triggering capital flight from emerging markets, economists say. The appreciation “is a real serious noose around the neck of the global economy,” David Beckworth, a senior research fellow at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University in Arlington, Va., said in November. What’s really alarming, though, is that even though the dollar has jumped 6 percent against the euro and 12 percent against the yen since the U.S. presidential election, it remains well below its historic highs. If its rise to date is causing trouble, imagine how much worse things could get if it went on a serious upward run.

It’s the Federal Reserve’s index of the value of the dollar against a basket of currencies of 26 trading partners, with each one’s value adjusted for that nation’s inflation rate. This is a better indicator of the dollar’s strength than the frequently cited U.S. Dollar Index, which covers just six currencies and isn’t adjusted for inflation. The Fed’s index remains 10 percent below its 2002 high and fully 19 percent below the lofty high of 1985, which led to an emergency international accord to lower the greenback’s value through official, coordinated sales of dollar reserves. Fundamental factors are driving the dollar upward. Because U.S. growth is strong and unemployment low, Fed policymakers are projecting three more quarter-point increases in short-term rates in 2017. That will tend to push up the dollar by making U.S. Treasurys and other fixed-income investments more lucrative. Investors are also betting President-elect Donald Trump will touch off a growth spurt through tax cuts and infrastructure investment. Meanwhile, “The euro zone debt crisis and the travails of the Chinese renminbi have weakened the dollar’s main rivals and cemented its dominance as a key benchmark for other currencies,” Cornell University economist Eswar Prasad wrote in an e-mail. ABN Amro, a Dutch bank with a more extreme forecast than most, projects that the euro, worth $1.15 as recently as May, will be only 95¢ for most of 2017. Trump Gives the Dollar Wings, it headlined a November research report. A strong dollar is bad for U.S. growth, making American goods and services less competitive in world markets. A rule of thumb says that a 10 percent rise in the dollar increases the trade deficit by 1 percent of gross domestic product, and that translates into the loss of hundreds of thousands of jobs, says Brad Setser, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York. Warnings about the damage from dollar strength have come recently from U.S. companies including Boeing, Emerson Electric, 3M, and United Technologies. The greenback’s strength could cause problems in emerging markets such as Mexico and Turkey, because it increases how much of the local currency borrowers need to spend to make payments on bonds they issued in dollars. And bond issuers in those countries must pay higher interest to attract buyers when the Fed raises rates. Petróleos Mexicanos pointed to the peso’s depreciation as a factor in a 23 percent increase in the peso value of its debt in the first three quarters of 2016. In China, debt-laden builders are suddenly having trouble selling dollar-denominated bonds. At the end of 2015 there was $9.7 trillion in nonfinancial debt outside the U.S. issued in dollars, and one-third of it was owed by issuers in emerging markets, according to the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), which is run jointly by the central banks of several countries. “If the current trend of dollar strength persists, it is very likely that we will see emerging market currency crises,” Variant Perception, a London-based research firm, wrote to clients in December. Whatever gains in trade competitiveness that emerging-market economies get when the dollar rises against their currencies can be outweighed by the rise in their borrowing costs, says a December research report by BIS economists Nikola Tarashev, Stefan Avdjiev, and Ben Cohen. That’s true mostly for countries whose finances are already fragile. Plenty of analysts see little reason for concern about the dollar’s rise. “We think the dollar has pretty much run its course,” says Gorky Urquieta, co-head of emerging-markets debt for Neuberger Berman, an asset management firm. Most emerging-market issuers of dollar debt are protected against a big dollar rise, either because they have offsetting financial hedges or because they receive a steady income of dollars from trade, says Joe Kogan, co-head of Latin America strategy at Scotia Capital Markets in New York. Emerging-market economies are in better shape than they were in 1997, when rising rates caused a financial crisis in Asia, says Mark Follett, managing director for emerging Asia debt capital markets at JPMorgan Chase in Hong Kong. Then again, Follett doesn’t know where the dollar is headed from here. “No one,” he says, “has any idea at the end of the day.” The bottom line: Several factors, from higher interest rates to a hoped-for Trump tax cut, are making the dollar stronger. ©2017 Bloomberg L.P.

On Monday night, seven American Airlines flight attendants were rushed to an Orlando, Fla. hospital after experiencing headaches due to a foul odor. On Oct. 25, a dozen British Airways attendants on a flight from San Francisco began babbling, forgetting where they were, and stuffing their mouths full of food, after breathing in suspected toxins, the Sunday Times of London reported last week. The crew exhibited signs of “forgetfulness, confusion and inability to think straight” as well as nausea, headaches and dizziness, an internal airline report read. In both cases the airlines found no fault with their planes. The Aerotoxic Association — a watchddog group founded and run mostly by former airline pilots and attendants — claim 96 percent of “fume events” go unreported. It estimates 360 incidents occur each day in the US and 1,300 worldwide. Experts differ wildly on the frequency of such events which, according to the flight attendants union manual, are usually caused when oil or hydraulic fluid leaks onto hot engine compressors, releasing fumes that can leak into the cabin through old or faulty seals. A 2015 study by Kansas State University claims fumes seep into cabin air about 5.5 times a day on U.S.-based flights. According to the Federal Aviation Administration, “the events are rare,” with 900 reported incidents over the last 10 years — much fewer than one a day. “It just goes to show you how there’s such a massive discrepancy between what’s getting officially recorded and what’s not,” said John Hoyte, an English pilot who founded Aerotoxic Association in 2007. He claims his group’s estimates come from internal reports obtained through sources. SEE ALSO Flight attendants can't 'think straight' after 'toxic fumes' leak :0 British Airways attendants began babbling, stuffing food in their mouths... Flight attendants can't 'think straight' after 'toxic fumes' leak Hoyte said he had to quit his job with a regional carrier because “I felt like a zombie and like I was constantly intoxicated,” he said. “I had very bad memory problems, difficulty processing thoughts and terrible fatigue.” The FAA only requires airlines to report fume events if the cause is a confirmed mechanical failure, said Judith Anderson, a health and safety specialist with the Association of Flight Attendants. Fumes from leaking oil wouldn’t necessarily be reported. “Nobody is really keeping track of this — or at least not close track,” said Anderson. “We know this is happening and we see a consistent pattern of symptoms, but people don’t make the connection that toxic fumes are making them sick.” In April 2016, former Alaska Airlines flight attendant Vashti Escobedo sued Boeing after allegedly developing a stutter, a right-hand tremor and memory loss. She blames “contaminated cabin air” on an August 2015 flight from Seattle to Austin, TX, for making her “extremely disoriented” and ending her career, according to legal papers. Toxic fumes can also affect passengers, but flight staff experience worse problems because of repeated exposure, Anderson said. Jet engine oil contains an aromatic compound called tricresyl phosphate, which first developed for chemical warfare, according to published reports and advocates. It’s added to the engine oil as an anti-wear agent, necessary because of the extremely high temperature jet engines reach. When inhaled, such organophospates attack and kill brain cells. The FAA maintains that “studies have indicated that cabin air is as good as or better than the air found in offices and homes,” and that “the cabin environment in the vast majority of commercial flights is safe,” a spokeswoman said.

At a time when a number of airlines are downsizing, Qatar Airways continued to see strong growth and inaugurated 14 new destinations across its global network and welcomed 19 new aircraft to its fleet, taking the count to 192, as well as placing a record aircraft order to power future growth. Qatar Airways has made a number of strategic investments in other airlines and airline groups, while investing heavily in the continued evolution of its own passenger experience. Lauded for its success, Qatar Airways received a number of awards throughout the year, confirming it as one of the world’s leading carriers for business and leisure travel. Fans or followers can enjoy a video created by the airline, highlighting it’s most special moments here. The airline also celebrated its strong financial performance, having finished the 2016 fiscal year with an operating profit of more than QAR 3 billion – the best yet for the Qatar Airways Group. Qatar Airways Group Chief Executive Akbar Al Baker, said: “I am extremely proud of the success that Qatar Airways has achieved together with our employees and partners in 2016. I’d like to extend my sincere gratitude to all staff for their discipline and tireless pursuit for excellence. I’d also like to extend my gratitude to our loyal passengers for their continued support. Our passengers will see a continuation of our commitment to providing the very best travel experiences in the year to come. This past year has truly been an exceptional year and, and as we turn to 2017 to celebrate Qatar Airways 20th Anniversary, I look forward to celebrating future successes with our employees, partners and passengers in the years to come as we go places together.” Route expansion Qatar Airways is one of the fastest growing airlines in aviation history, with the airline now serving over 150 destinations following the inauguration of 14 new destinations in 2016 alone. Providing even more choice for travellers, the airline introduced exciting destinations such as Adelaide (Australia), Atlanta (USA), Birmingham (UK), Boston (USA), Helsinki (Finland), Los Angeles (USA), Marrakech (Morocco), Pisa (Italy), Ras Al-Khaimah (UAE), Sydney (Australia), Windhoek (Namibia),  Yerevan (Armenia), Krabi (Thailand) and Mahe (Seychelles). Fleet expansion Qatar Airways took delivery of 19 new aircraft in 2016, creating a total fleet of 192 aircraft. Having been the global launch customer of the A350, Qatar Airways continued to deliver on its fleet expansion and renewal strategy, having placed a record $11.7 billion order for 30 B787-9 Dreamliners and 10 777-300ERs, as well as signing a Letter of Intent for up to 60 737 Max 8s valued at $6.9 billion. The landmark order, combined with previous orders results in a total of 350 Airbus and Boeing aircraft to be delivered to the airline over the coming years valued at more than $90 billion. Qatar Airways enjoys one of the youngest fleets in the world, averaging just five years, and the combination of its short and long haul mixed fleet provides the airline with the operational agility to maximize efficiency and profit by putting the right aircraft on the right route – every time. Qatar Airways’ private jet arm, Qatar Executive, was the global launch customer for the Gulfstream G650ER, and placed an order for a further three G650ERs – the fastest and longest range private jet aircraft in the world – at the Farnborough Airshow in July. The latest order will make Qatar Executive the largest dedicated G650 operator globally. Qatar Airways’ A380 is welcomed by a water cannon solute on its inaugural flight to Atlanta, USA in June.

Can The Businessman Do What Politicians Cannot? Published January 7, 2017 Facebook0 Twitter0 livefyre0 Email Print AP By Joe Bilello -  Fox News @Joe_Bilello Have you ever read your morning paper and thought to yourself, "Why did it cost $17 million to plant some flowers in the town square?" Perhaps they had to pay a union crew to survey the land (drink coffee and talk about baseball) for a few months before starting the project. Then they had to pay a master electrician thousands of dollars to be on-call because of the underground power line 300 yards away. Then they heard that a family of pygmy turtles may be living in the area, so the project was delayed for six months. But payments continued. Or perhaps the town supervisor’s brother-in-law is a florist, a very wealthy florist. Whatever the reason, when the government gets involved, the price tag never seems to match the project at hand. Is it incompetence, carelessness, corruption or a combination of all three? Or just human nature? Wasting other people's money is not always a sign of corruption and criminality. Very often, it is merely a character trait of being human. When on their lunch break, many people often think, "How many White Castles can I get for five bucks?" But when in possession of the company credit card, the mentality suddenly shifts to, "Who's got the best porterhouse in town?" The guy who seems to drink responsibly when his cocktails are $12 a pop is the same guy who always has to be carried out of the company's open-bar Christmas party. Spending other people's money can be a very attractive prospect. So attractive, you can find yourself $20 trillion in debt before you know it. Can the new president change the mentality that is bankrupting future generations of Americans? Donald Trump’s promise to build a wall along the southern border was perhaps the primary rallying cry of his presidential campaign. His desire to curb illegal immigration and prevent potential terrorists, drug couriers and sex traffickers from entering the United States was very appealing to many voters. But for others, the true appeal of having a cutthroat businessman in the White House was when he spoke of the wall in a different context. In a February 2016 CNN-hosted GOP primary debate, moderator Wolf Blitzer questioned the cost of Mr. Trump’s proposed border wall, to which the candidate responded, "Now, the wall is $10 billion-$12 billion, if I do it. If these guys do it, it'll end up costing $200 billion." That one quote summed up the appeal of Donald Trump to millions of true fiscal conservatives. He envisions a project, sets a cost and timeframe and commits to completing the project on time, on or under budget. The government, on the other hand, envisions a project, estimates an absurdly bloated price tag and then ultimately spends ten times more time and money than originally estimated. Prior to the presidential election, the aircraft manufacturing company and major Clinton Foundation donor, Boeing, drew up plans for a new $4-plus billion Air Force One project. Their assumption was that newly-elected President Hillary Clinton would sign off on the plan, no questions asked, except perhaps whether they could sneak a few more luxuries in before production. Other people's money would be no object. But newly-elected businessman Trump did have some questions. Do we even need a new Air Force One? Why does it cost over $4 billion? After evaluating the situation, Mr. Trump concluded it was an unnecessary expenditure and simply proclaimed, "Cancel it!" Trump critics claim that the sophistication of the aircraft warrants a $4 billion price tag. But does anyone actually believe that there is no correlation between the cost of the plane and the cozy relationship between Boeing and the Clintons? After rejecting the proposal for a new Air Force One, at least under the current terms, Mr. Trump met with Lockheed Martin CEO Marillyn Hewson about bringing down the cost of the F-35 fighter jet.  Although not even president yet, it appears as though Donald Trump is asking the few simple questions that past presidents seemed incapable of asking – like why does it cost this much and do we really even need this? Not all politicians are corrupt thieves. Many are just human beings who suddenly have unlimited access to other people's money. And their frugality goes out the window the minute they get that taxpayer-funded, no-limit credit card. Donald Trump may not be any more ethical than anyone else. But the hope is that decades of a shrewd business mentality has been permanently ingrained in his mind, and he does not succumb to the usual inevitable corruption, or at least carelessness, that accompanies public office. Mr. Trump has always dealt with his own money and it remains to be seen whether or not his mindset will change when dealing with other people's money. But so far, he appears to be doing the right thing.

By Kali Holloway / AlterNet January 7, 2017 Print Comments Photo Credit: YouTube / CNN Every post-election week with Donald Trump feels like an eternity. The details change but the story stays the same: Trump whines, lies and pleads for attention, scrambling facts, fiction and conspiracy into a fatiguing, but now familiar blend. Last week followed the same formula, with Trump pretending not to know what he knows and to be an expert in everything he doesn’t know, all while waging petty wars using time that could be spent boning up on policy. He ended the week with an intelligence briefing (we’ve sunk so low, PEOTUS doing his job qualifies as news), but it did little to markedly shift the tone. And in that tone is the message, "We are so screwed." So we don’t forget, here’s a look back at just 10 of Trump’s most recent lies and fails. 1. Calling for an investigation of NBC instead of the Russian hacks. Trump’s denial of Russian cyberattacks in the face of tremendous evidence may be because he 1) actually thinks he knows more than the generals do; 2) is the ultimate Putin fanboy and debtor to Russia; or 3) is a Kremlin puppet. Add to this the fact that Trump refuses to have daily intelligence briefings because he’s “like, a smart person,” and the knowledge gap makes yet more sense. After making a big show of his disinterest in national security issues, Trump got huffy after NBC News offered a sneak peek into the findings detailed in an intelligence report on the Russian hacks. Though he’s steadfastly stood against an investigation into Russian cyberespionage against American democracy, he’s now calling for an investigation into “top secret intelligence shared with NBC prior to me seeing it.” He cares because he was left out. Trump only wants to be in a club that won’t have him as a member. After finally sitting down to be briefed by intelligence officials Friday, Trump released a statement saying the meeting was "constructive," but he still failed to focus on Russia as the primary culprit, talking in circles. He announced that he'll be putting together a team to broadly combat cyberattacks, but said nothing about digging into the hacking the entire rest of the country wants to know about.  2. Making personal calls instead of doing his friggin’ job. A bitter, pathetic man who has dedicated his life to seeking revenge, Trump is still duking it out with Ohio governor John Kasich, who dropped out of the GOP presidential race nearly a year ago. Instead of attending to the things an incoming president should be, Trump took a break from hate-tweeting at TV shows to make personal phone calls to Ohio voters, all because he wants a Kasich-backed candidate to lose in the state GOP race. Funny what he finds time for. 3. Accepting Julian Assange’s word over 17 intelligence agencies. Trump doubts the experts of 17 U.S. intelligence agencies who contend they have concrete proof of Russian hacking, and thinks we should just go with Wikileaks founder and rape suspect Julian Assange on this one. Trump sent multiple tweets this week pushing Assange’s claims on the matter, along with bloviations from Fox News blowhard Sean Hannity. When called out on it, Trump tweeted, “The media lies to make it look like I am against 'Intelligence' when in fact I am a big fan!” 4. Admitting he duped his know-nothing voter base on the border wall, then lying again. As was apparent to any non-delusional person since Trump launched his campaign, there is no way Mexico is going to pay for Trump’s big, dumb wall. Trump, correctly estimating the sky-high gullibility of his base, knew this the whole time. In recent days, his team reportedly told House Republicans “that [Trump’s] preference is to fund the border wall through the appropriations process,” i.e., taxpayer dollars. After news leaked that Trump’s central campaign promise was a big lie, he told another lie to cover it up, insisting, “that any money spent on building the Great Wall...will be paid back by Mexico later!” Except no, it won’t. You can’t just invoice a country for your nonsense bad ideas, sorry. 5. Lying about having a hand in every job-saving deal. Trump has lied about creating or saving jobs for Sprint, Carrier and Ford. 6. But refusing to take credit for job losses. After Macy’s responded to Trump’s racist comments about Mexicans by removing his clothing line from the store (though his daughter Ivanka’s label is still sold there), he demanded his supporters boycott the department store chain for being “disloyal.” Whether that boycott was the source of Macy’s recent financial woes is up for debate, but since Trump has taken credit where it definitely isn’t due for the last 18 months (and pretty much his whole life), he deserves at least part of the blame for the 10,000 job cuts and 68 store closings the retailer announced days ago. That’s also true for Boeing, which saw stocks tumble after Trump tweeted negatively about it because he was angry about a magazine article. The company has announced it’s cutting 8 percent of jobs in 2017. And what about the 109 Kmart and 41 Sears stores that are shuttering? Or the jobs McDonald’s is outsourcing to India? Not a peep from Trump, despite that fact that those unemployment numbers will be absorbed by the working class he lies about defending. All in all, the thousands of people who will be losing their jobs far outpaces the people whose jobs Trump only pretended to save.  7. Calling Democratic senator Chuck Shumer a 'clown,' then saying we need to unite 9 minutes later. The Democrats, lead by head clown Chuck Schumer, know how bad ObamaCare is and what a mess they are in. Instead of working to fix it, they..— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 5, 2017   ...time for Republicans & Democrats to get together and come up with a healthcare plan that really works - much less expensive & FAR BETTER!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 5, 2017 8. Throwing Obama’s political ambassadors and their families out on short notice. According to the New York Times, Trump’s team has “issued a blanket edict requiring politically appointed ambassadors to leave their overseas posts by Inauguration Day...breaking with decades of precedent by declining to provide even the briefest of grace periods.” There are reportedly “no exceptions,” including those previously granted to ambassadors who will need to uproot their families, especially those with school-age kids. The Times reports that the Trump decision “threatens to leave the United States without Senate-confirmed envoys for months in critical nations like Germany, Canada and Britain.” “It feels like there’s an element just of spite and payback in it,” Derek Shearer, a former U.S. ambassador to Finland, told the newspaper. “I don’t see a higher policy motive.” 9. Scheduling a news conference to distract from his appointee hearings. Trump tweeted a few days ago that he “will be having a general news conference on JANUARY ELEVENTH in N.Y.C.” That means nothing, considering Trump is a pathological liar who promises things all the time. Still, this press conference may happen, if only because it’s scheduled the same day as confirmation hearings for his cabinet picks. As Media Matters notes: “The strategy seems designed to ensure that the media is unable to devote sufficient scrutiny to each story and to reduce the possibility of an educated public responding...[B]y refusing to give a press conference for so long...Trump has created such a backlog of potential issues that it will be impossible for reporters to give all of them the time and coverage they deserve. Meanwhile, McConnell has done his best to fracture journalist attention by ensuring that six different confirmation hearings are scheduled for the same day...Several of these nominations are extremely controversial...But with all the hearings stacked on the same day, on top of Trump’s press conference, it’s impossible for the media to provide the information people need. And that’s the point—it appears to be a deliberate effort to manipulate both the press and the public.” 10. Still publicly smarting about being dissed by all the cool-kid pop stars for his little inauguration thing. He’s super bad at playing it cool.  Jackie Evancho's album sales have skyrocketed after announcing her Inauguration performance. Some people just don't understand the "Movement"— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 4, 2017   Hopefully, all supporters, and those who want to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, will go to D.C. on January 20th. It will be a GREAT SHOW!— Donald J.

Ford announced it would cancel its $1.6 billion plans to build a plant in San Luis Potosi, Mexico, and instead invest an additional $700 million to expand an existing plant in Michigan to make autonomous and electric vehicles. That comes on the heels of another decision in November to keep production of some small SUVs at its plant in Kentucky. That announcement came a couple of hours after Trump took to Twitter to criticize General Motors: "General Motors is sending Mexican made model of Chevy Cruze to U.S. car dealers-tax free across border. Make in U.S.A.or pay big border tax!" GM responded that only a small number of hatchback models are manufactured in Mexico and sold at U.S. car dealers. "All Chevrolet Cruze sedans sold in the U.S. are built in GM's assembly plant in Lordstown, Ohio. GM builds the Chevrolet Cruze hatchback for global markets in Mexico, with a small number sold in the U.S." Why did Ford change its mind? The move marks a departure for Ford, whose CEO last month said it was looking forward to working with the Trump administration on trade but that it very likely wouldn't change plans for its $1.6 billion factory. Now CEO Mark Fields tells NPR that Trump's rhetoric was a factor in reversing the earlier decision, but one of several factors. He says the carmaker was influenced by promises of new tax and regulatory reforms and the prospect of keeping jobs at home. "Ford is a global automaker, but our home ... is right here in the United States," he said. What is the significance of this change? It means 700 additional Ford jobs will come to Michigan, and Ford says every factory job is likely to create another seven related jobs. "We've created 28,000 jobs and we've invested $12 billion in the U.S. in our plants in the last five years," Fields said in a press conference. Shifting a factory itself would not be news but for the fact that it is highly unusual for companies to respond to direct, public pressure from an incoming president. "I know from talking to business people that no major firm wants to be a subject of a Trump tweet," says Gary Hufbauer, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. He says companies realize Trump controls the Justice Department, the Defense Department, the IRS, Treasury and regulatory agencies, and "the amount of control that intersects with what companies are doing is enormous." Will such moves inspire retaliatory trade barriers that hurt other U.S. firms and cost American jobs? Trump has pledged to rework U.S. trade agreements, including the North American Free Trade Agreement. Trump has also called for high tariffs on companies that manufacture products overseas and then import them for sale in the U.S. The question is how broad such tariffs would be, and whether American trading partners would object and retaliate with similar measures. So far, Trump has (or claims to have) put pressure on American companies including Carrier, Sprint, Ford, Boeing, Lockheed Martin and GM. But Hufbauer says if Trump makes good on actually raising tariffs, "I think some form of retaliation [from other countries] is almost certain." Who's next, and what is the possible economic impact? So far, tweeting trade and other corporate policy has played well for Trump. He has targeted Boeing for a potentially large contract to build a new Air Force One, and he criticized Lockheed Martin for its expensive F-35 fighter jet contracts. Hufbauer says it remains unclear what the economic impact of all this will be. So far, the tweets have gotten a massive amount of media attention, and that may mean it will continue and that others — consumer brands in particular — could find themselves targets. "Some people may wrongly think this is the way to create jobs in the U.S.," Hufbauer says. "My estimate is that this kind of thing [companies responding to tweets] is not going to have a major effect," and it is not in keeping with a well-functioning economy," says David Dollar, senior fellow for the Brookings Institution.

File Picture: EPA/NEELS KRUGER Kuala Lumpur — The hunt for missing flight MH370 will end in two weeks, Malaysia’s transport minister said on Friday, as relatives of passengers demanded that authorities push on with the search. "We’re at the final lap within these two weeks," the minister, Liow Tiong Lai told reporters. "We hope we can find the plane." Liow did not specify a date but said that a tripartite meeting will be held after a final report is released when the 120,000km² search ends. Authorities had previously said the search would end early this year. The last search vessel embarked on its final sweep across the southern Indian Ocean last month. The Malaysian Airlines jet disappeared en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing on March 8, 2014, carrying 239 passengers and crew. It is believed that the Malaysian Airlines plane crashed into the Indian Ocean, but an extensive deep-sea hunt off Australia’s west coast has failed to find a single piece of debris. The Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB), which has been leading the search mission, said in a report last month that the Boeing jet is almost certainly not in the current search zone and may be further north. The report was based on a review of evidence by Australian and international experts. Australia has said that it did not view the report findings as credible. The governments of Australia, Malaysia and China, where most of the passengers were from, previously agreed to pull the plug on the operation once the current search area was fully scoured unless "credible new information" emerged. "We cannot just base [a search] on assumptions. We need credible clues to look for the plane," said Liow when asked about the possibility of a search further north. Many families have been long sceptical about whether the ongoing search is in the right place. In a statement late on Thursday, the international group of MH370 next-of-kin, Voice 370, called on Malaysia, Australia and China to consider the next step before the current search ends. "Extending the search to the new area defined by experts is an inescapable duty owed to the flying public in the interest of aviation safety," it said. AFP Please login or register to comment.

Recapping the Airline's performance in 2016, Group CEO Ethiopian Airlines, Mr. Tewolde GebreMariam, said: “2016 has been an exceptionally challenging year for the African Aviation industry. Commodity exporting countries in general and oil exporting African countries in particular have been hit hard by the global decline of commodity prices. As a result, demand for air travel has been suppressed and the shortage of foreign exchange has severely affected the financial performance of airlines in the continent.” “We celebrated our 70th anniversary, inaugurated the largest and the finest Aviation Academy in Africa and a state-of-the-art In-flight Catering facility which is the largest in the continent of Africa, introduced Africa's first Ethiopian Airbus A350, and spread our wings to more countries on 5 continents. Despite the sluggish growth in the world's matured market, all of our 12,000 colleagues remained focused on the robust execution of our vision 2025, which has proved to be a winning strategy in today's hyper-competitive and complex airline business. We wish to thank our valued customers for their continued vote of confidence on our services and for making Ethiopian as their airline of choice.” Major Diversification on the Core Fleet According to Mr. GebreMariam, Ethiopian has increased its fleet by 8 aircraft in 2016 and has closed the year with 82 airplanes in service. For the first time in its history, Ethiopian has diversified to include Airbus aircraft, with Africa's first A350. “With an average fleet age of just five years, Ethiopian has one of the youngest and most modern fleet in the world. Ethiopian has heavily invested in the two most technologically advanced fleet of our time; the B787 Dream Liner and the A350. With high performance, less carbon emission, advanced cabin features, and superior customer comfort, these airplanes are game changers in today's civil aviation industry. “Efficient Network of Convenient connectivity Living its motto of Bringing Africa Together and Closer to the World, Ethiopian has continued to connect the African continent with its major trading cities and markets. With connections as short as 30 minutes at our Addis Ababa hub airport, we offer the fastest travel time between Africa and the rest of the world for our customers. Both through our main hub in Addis and our regional hubs in Lomé (Togo) and Lilongwe (Malawi), we are connecting African brothers and sisters scale up tourism, trade and investment with in the continent.” He said in 2016 Ethiopian Airlines launched new international flights to the Comoros Islands, Windhoek, and Newark and domestic routes to Hawassa, Kebridahar and Dembidolo. “Ethiopian Cargo Services has also remained to be the largest cargo airline in Africa. Customer experience investments We have also been honored by the ways our world class service has been recognized: SKYTRAX World Airline Award for Best Airline Staff in Africa and Rising Star Carrier of the Year Award (both for the second year in a row), Cargo Airline of the Year, and African Airline of the Year Award are few to mention. “Redefining our passengers' onboard experience, we have successfully completed the modification of all our Boeing 787 Dreamliners with lie-flat beds. We have expanded and renovated our lounges in our Addis hub. In line with our new Inflight catering facilities, we have invested in upgrading our inflight meals with new menus, new cutlery, on board plating, new chinaware and new service delivery. We have also revamped our ShebaMiles Frequent Flyer Program with a major focus on enhancing our customers' experience. On ground, new advance check-in procedure to enable customers check-in at their convenience, newly designed website, self-check-in and self-boarding.” Infrastructure Aviation Academy: Under infrastructure, Mr. GebreMariam said Ethiopian has built largest and the latest Aviation Academy in Africa, with an investment of USD 100 million. “The Academy has the best aviation training technology that an airline academy can offer; full range of fleet cabin emergency, evacuation and door trainers fitted with a high standard swimming pool for cabin crew ditching exercises and more than 20 pilot training aircraft, Class Rooms, Student Cafeteria, Auditorium Hall, Student dormitory, Green compound with space for outdoor sports.” Cargo According to Mr. GebreMariam, the New Cargo Terminal, 82% complete, is expected to be operational towards April 2017, which will have an annual storage (for both dry and perishable goods) of 1.2 million tons and a capacity to handle eight B747-800 freighters at a time. Construction of the first phase only will cost approximately US$ 150 million. “Upon completion, our uplifting capability will be equivalent to the cargo terminals at Amsterdam Schiphol, Singapore Changi or Hong Kong. A Four Star Hotel construction: with the booming construction in our capital Addis Ababa, Ethiopian's four star hotel construction is progressing, with 30 percent completion. The hotel will have 330 rooms, a banquet hall to accommodate 2000 guests, restaurants, a swimming pool, gym, and spa. Catering: Ethiopian has inaugurated the largest Catering Facility in Africa, with a capacity more than all hotels in the city combined: 100,000 meals per day. It will soon commence third-party service and generate revenue to continue as an independent profit center.” Maintenance Hangar He said the newly built wide body maintenance hangar is now 97% completed. The hangar has two bays equipped with latest technologies; a full Paint hangar, and Maintenance hangar. The facility is capable of accommodating 2-B747-800 (the biggest Boeing airplane) at a time or more other type of aircraft in different arrangements. Simulator: Ethiopian has constructed a state-of–art flight simulator building and installed five of the latest full flight simulators (FFS). This includes; the Boeing 787, 777, 757, 767, 737NG and the Bombardier Q400. Likewise, we are on our way to have full flight simulators for A350XWB and Boeing B737 MAX aircrafts. Corporate Social Responsibility According to Mr. GebreMariam, during the 2016 Ethiopian has partnered with significant number of local and international organization to discharge its corporate Social responsibility including Free Shipment of Medicine by Airlink USA, Shipment of Colonel John Charles Robinson's Sculpture, humanitarian shipment for UNICEF Ethiopia and free ticket grants to support medical travelers abroad. – By: citifmonline.com/Ghana Comments: This article has 1 comments, leave your comment.

(View our Privacy Policy) Former MOSI employee contends for 'Hidden Figures' award By Joyce McKenzie, Times Correspondent JOYCE MCKENZIETampa Bay Times Friday, January 6, 2017 5:26pm Print 0 My Edition I want to see more articles tagged I'm already following articles tagged Previous Next Previous Next TAMPA — A 2010 Wharton High School graduate has been named as a top contender in The Search for Hidden Figures contest, a scholarship competition aimed at recognizing the nation's most talented emerging female leaders in science, technology, engineering and math. Related News/Archive New movie 'Hidden Figures' resonates with local black women who pioneered in STEM fields 4 Days Ago Little girl's dreams grow into stellar career for winner of MOSI Hispanic scientist award 5 Months Ago A little change helps MOSI kids change the summer for other kids 5 Months Ago From a field of more than 7,300 applicants Midori Maeda, 24, the daughter of Tampa residents Cesar and Zonia Maeda, is among the 50 semi-finalists selected in a competition that will honor two grand prize winners in each of two categories that include students ages 13-19, and professionals ages 20 and older. If chosen as one of the final winners, she will take home $50,000 in research grant money, a year's worth of free access to STEM training materials and programs at the New York Academy of Sciences, and a trip to the Kennedy Space Center in Orlando. The winners will be announced on Thursday (Jan. 12). The contest, sponsored by PepsiCo and 21st Century Fox, was inspired by the production of the movie Hidden Figures, which depicts the careers of African American female mathematicians Katherine Johnson, Dorothy Vaughan and Mary Jackson, who worked behind the scenes of the NASA Manned Space Program during the days of Jim Crow when blacks were relegated to the status of second class citizens. The film debuted on Friday (Jan. 6) in theaters across the country. "I'm very excited to see the movie and these women who paved the road for women in the STEM field," Maeda said. "Along the way I've had some great female mentors and I really want to lead by example." Unlike John Glenn, who gained instant fame in 1962 when he became the first American to orbit the earth, this trio of pioneering professionals performed their critical work toward the space mission's success in a segregated wing of NASA's Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia, absent of any accolades. Maeda — whose mother emigrated to the U.S. from Ecuador and whose father was from Mexico — graduated cum laude in 2014 from the University of Florida, where she earned a bachelor's degree in material sciences and engineering from the University of Florida. Last month she received a master's degree in macromolecular science and engineering from the University of Michigan, where in August she plans to begin work toward her doctorate degree. During her summer breaks she did various high-tech internships in South Carolina at Boeing, in Ohio at Proctor and Gamble and at the Air Force Research Laboratory. She currently works in a biomedical engineering lab in Ann Arbor, Mich., creating artificial tissues in an effort to better understand abnormal matter. Maeda attributes much of her love for science and engineering to her affiliation with Tampa's Museum of Science & Industry in her youth. "I volunteered over 100 hours at MOSI as a Wharton High School student and that fueled my passion for STEM," she said. In the summer of 2015 she returned to MOSI as a technology instructor in the Idea Zone, where she taught guests how to build robots, program computers and design 3D models for 3D printing. "I've always held a passion for hands-on work and therefore it was so rewarding to help kids gain confidence in their design and building skills," Maeda said. "The Idea Zone is one of the largest makerspaces in the Southeast and I'm proud to live in a city that fosters this forward-thinking initiative." Tony Palaez, MOSI's director of Innovations, described Maeda as a wonderful asset to the organization. "She's such an inspiration for any young person, especially women, and she's definitely the perfect person to win this award," Palaez said. Her dad, who also holds a master's degree in biology and is aiming toward earning a doctoral degree at the University of Florida, said Midori, the eldest of his family's three children, has always loved to do investigative-type work. "I think the main thing about Midori is her will to always learn new things," Cesar Maeda said. Contact Joyce McKenzie at hillsnews@tampabay.com.

Alts Currency-Hedged Equities Fixed-Income New ETFs Webcasts ETF Newsletter Video Podcasts ETF Strategist Channel 2017 Outlook Channel Search You Are Here: Home → 2017 → January → Getting a Handle on Dow ETFs as DJIA Eyes 20,000 Getting a Handle on Dow ETFs as DJIA Eyes 20,000 January 6, 2017 at 5:50 pm by Tom Lydon The Dow Jones Industrial Average was one point short of 20,000 on Friday, bringing renewed attention on the storied benchmark index and related exchange traded funds. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, or simply the Dow, rose to as much as 19,999.63 on Friday or just shy of the widely anticipated 20,000 landmark as a strong jobs report helped further fuel the post-election rally. The equities rally has been bolstered by hopes of business-friendly policies under a new Donald Trump administration after the President-elect promised to enact $1 trillion in infrastructure spending, corporate tax cuts and potentially repeal regulatory hurdles. Furthermore, many anticipate earnings to return to growth after five consecutive quarters of declines, especially with energy stocks rebounding on rising crude oil prices and the strengthening economic outlook. With the renewed focus on the Dow, ETF investors have also jumped on the momentum with Dow-related ETFs, such as the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF (NYSEArca: DIA), which tracks the Dow Jones Industrial Average, and the Guggenheim Dow Jones Industrial Average Dividend ETF (NYSEArca: DJD), which weighs the 30 Dow stocks by yield. Potential investors, though, should be aware that the Dow isn’t like your normal market capitalization-weighted index, such as the S&P 500. The major difference between the two indices is found in their indexing methodology. The Dow focuses on a price-weighted average of 30 stocks while the S&P 500 is a market capitalization-weighted index of 500 large companies. The Dow is composed of the 30 largest companies in the U.S. across a number of sectors. Holdings are selected by the editors of the Wall Street Journal. Since the index follows price-weighted methodology, components with higher prices will have a larger impact on the daily movements in the Dow, which has drawn some criticism over its somewhat arbitrary weighting method. Daily changes in the Dow are calculated by adding prices of the 30 Dow stocks and then divided by the “Dow Divisor.” Currently, DIA’s top holdings include Goldman Sachs Group (NYSE: GS) 8.3%, 3M Co. (NYSE: MMM) 6.1%, International Business Machines (NYSE: IBM) 5.8%, UnitedHealth Group (NYSE: UNH) 5.6% and Boeing Company (NYSE: BA) 5.5%. Sector weights include industrials 19.7%, financials 17.9%, information technology 17.0%, consumer discretionary 14.3%, health care 12.8%, Energy 7.1%, consumer staples 6.7%, materials 2.5% and telecom services 1.9%. In contrast, the S&P 500 is more diversified, with its largest holding Apple (NasdaqGS: AAPL) account for a little over 3%. Additionally, The S&P 500 overweights information technology, with more evenly spread out weights in its other sector positions. Meanwhile, the newer DJD weights positions on dividends, with top holdings including Chevron (NYSE: CVX) 5.7%, Verizon Communications (NYSE: VZ) 5.3%, Caterpillar (NYSE: CAT), 5.0% Boeing (NYSE: BA) 4.8% and International Business Machines (NYSE: IBM) 4.4%. Sector allocations include industrials 18.9%, information technology 18.4%, healthcare 13.4%, consumer staples 11.4%, financials 11.0%, energy 9.5%, consumer discretionary 9.5%, telecom services 5.3% and materials 2.6%. Due to its weighting methodology, DJD comes with a slightly higher 2.47% 12-month yield, compared to DIA’s 2.26% 12-month yield. However, DIA shows a cheaper 0.17% expense ratio, compared to DJD’s 0.30% expense ratio, which diminishes the positive effect from the dividend-focused ETF’s higher yield.

(AP Photo/Andrew Harnik) Written by Alan Freeman Published Friday, January 6th, 2017 Featured Opinion Facebook Twitter Imagine if U.S. dairy farmers got to Donald Trump and explained to him how American butter, cheese and yogurt are essentially blocked from entering Canada by astronomical tariffs under our supply management system. In a minute, he’d be on Twitter denouncing Canada for being “unfair” to farmers in Wisconsin and Vermont and vowing to slap an onerous import tax on Alberta bitumen, Quebec maple syrup and Bombardier business jets in retaliation. Canadian farmers, fearful that their comfortable marketing arrangement was under threat, would plead that supply management is perfectly legal under the North American Free Trade Agreement. The Trudeau government, petrified about unleashing a trade war, would mumble support for farmers while quickly trying to figure how to assuage the 45th U.S. president by showing  how “open” it is to renegotiating NAFTA, including when it comes to agriculture. Supply management could face its greatest existential challenge ever, thanks to a single tweet. Sounds crazy but that’s the new world we’re living in. The world’s leading superpower and our most important trading partner is about to be led by a man who tweets before he thinks and who isn’t bothered by the niceties of international diplomacy and the legalities of world trading rules. As Canadians, we are trying to convince ourselves that somehow we’re exempt from Trump’s economic nationalism and anti-free trade sentiments. When Trump goes after NAFTA, he’s really targeting Mexico and when he wants to slap duties on imports, he means China, we tell ourselves. We’re Canadians after all. We’re nice guys and almost American. Brian Mulroney, who never met a billionaire he didn’t like, says he knows Donald Trump as a neighbour and buddy in Palm Beach, and assures us that we have nothing to fear. “Donald Trump, I think, wants to be known as a great president, and that’s entirely up to him,” he recently told an interviewer. “And one of the ways he can do it is by co-operating with a great ally like Canada and I think it’s going to happen.” Really, Brian? Donald Trump, who has not hesitated to go after Boeing, Lockheed Martin, United Technologies, GM and Toyota let alone the FBI, the CIA and the U.S. intelligence establishment, is somehow going to spare Canada from his ravings if he thinks it’s politically expedient? Don’t think so. Take the auto industry. Trump is fixated on bringing back industrial jobs to rust-belt states like Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania, which made his victory on Nov. 8 possible. So far he has focused on Mexico, where the industry has committed to huge investments in recent years, but that doesn’t mean Canada’s industry will be exempt. Next time GM, Ford or Chrysler has to choose between placing a new product or an extra shift at a plant in Ontario or one in the U.S., it will have to weigh the potentially explosive political impact of its decision as well as the economic and business case. As a Detroit executive, will it be worth provoking an angry tweet from President Trump for the sake of saving a few hundred jobs north of the border? We may have had cross-border free trade in autos for half a century, but nobody in Oshawa or Woodstock voted for Donald Trump in November. What can Canada do? Probably not a lot. Seeking out allies in Congress, which must ultimately pass trade legislation and may take a more reasoned look, is useful. The welcome video to members of the new Congress hosted by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Canada’s Ambassador to the U.S., David McNaughton, was a nice effort though it seems far more likely than Canadians will watch it than a newly minted Member of the House of Representatives or a Senator. Both Trudeau and McNaughton have said that Canada is open to talking about NAFTA and modernizing it, without providing details, which is fine but unlikely to stave off a wholesale redo of NAFTA if that’s what Trump wants. They may talk lots about how important cross-border trade with Canada is to a few dozen U.S. states but if it’s a question of favouring a U.S. supplier of steel or city buses over one from Canada, Buy America is likely to win with the public every time. Canada’s best policy may be to play a low-key game. When we seek attention on bilateral files, it often ends unhappily. One of the stupidest policies ever was for Alberta, abetted by the Harper government, to boast about the development of the oil sands to Americans, as if it was a beautiful thing. Better to keep quiet about the fact that northern Alberta had been turned into a giant open-pit mine. There was no better argument against the Keystone XL pipeline with environmentalists than a look at the oil-sands facilities around Fort McMurray. As Canadians, we’re often better off staying under the radar, doing our business quietly across the border, making sure not to attract too much attention. Our best hope may be that the tweeter in chief gets so busy waging trade wars elsewhere that we can somehow escape his notice.

Furious relatives of the missing passengers have called the cancellation of the search a ‘kick in the guts’. ‘Obviously ‘it’s another kick in the guts for the families,’ Danica Weeks, whose husband Paul was on board the jet told Fairfax Media. ‘We’ve had so much hope and then each time we’ve got the hope up and it’s been washed away.’ Authorities had previously said the search will end early this year. The last search vessel embarked on its final sweep across the southern Indian Ocean last month. The Malaysian Airlines jet disappeared en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing on March 8, 2014, carrying 239 passengers and crew. It is believed that the Malaysian Airlines plane crashed into the Indian Ocean, but an extensive deep-sea hunt off Australia’s west coast has failed to find a single piece of debris. The Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB), which has been leading the search mission, said in a report last month that the Boeing jet is almost certainly not in the current search zone and may be further north. The report was based on a review of evidence by Australian and international experts. But Australian experts have questioned if the report’s findings are credible. The governments of Australia, Malaysia and China, where most of the passengers were from, previously agreed to pull the plug on the operation once the current search area was fully scoured unless ‘credible new information’ emerged. ‘We cannot just base [a search] on assumptions. We need credible clues to look for the plane,’ said Liow when asked about the possibility of a search further north.   Liow Tiong Lai Malaysian Airlines MH370 Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

Pretty fly for a South African guy 6 Jan 2017 at 20:32, Iain Thomson America's Federal Aviation Administration has cleared SpaceX to launch satellites into Earth's orbit using the science upstart's rockets. This comes after the watchdog scrutinized the cause of last year's dramatic explosion on a SpaceX launchpad: on September 1, a refueling cockup strongly encouraged a Falcon 9 rocket, along with a $200m internet relay satellite on top, to spread itself finely over Cape Canaveral. SpaceX's own report came out earlier this week, tracing the problem back to helium containers that got too cold. SpaceX's short-term solution is to store the gas at a higher temperature; the long-term solution will involve redesigning the tanks. The FAA seems happy with this arrangement, and has given Elon Musk's space biz a license [PDF] for orbital deliveries. "The FAA accepted the investigation report on the AMOS-6 mishap and has closed the investigation," the agency said in a statement. "SpaceX applied for a license to launch the Iridium NEXT satellites from Vandenberg Air Force Base. The FAA has granted a license for that purpose." The news comes just in time for SpaceX, but wasn't entirely unexpected. The organization was obviously anticipating clearance, as it has been prepping a rocket at Vandenberg Air Force Base carrying a cluster of Iridium communications satellites, and there's a launch window open early next week. Hold-down firing of @SpaceX Falcon 9 at Vandenberg Air Force completed. All systems are go for launch next week. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) January 5, 2017 The Iridium contract is important for SpaceX's cash flow. The satellite communications business has already cancelled one contract with SpaceX, and if the Falcon's flight had been delayed further, more contracts could have been in the balance. Iridium is excited to share we're planned to launch on Monday, Jan 9 at 10:22am PST weather permitting. https://t.co/wiHgvdD6lk #IridiumNEXT — Iridium Corporate (@IridiumComm) January 6, 2017 Having said that, SpaceX's main customer, NASA, is going to keep the funds coming in for Elon's crew. On Tuesday the agency awarded Boeing and SpaceX four launch contracts to deliver astronauts to the International Space Station, once the two companies have been cleared for human cargo. "Awarding these missions now will provide greater stability for the future space station crew rotation schedule, as well as reduce schedule and financial uncertainty for our providers," said Phil McAlister, director, NASA's Commercial Spaceflight Development Division. "The ability to turn on missions as needed to meet the needs of the space station program is an important aspect of the Commercial Crew Program." On Friday, Elon Musk paid a visit to US president-elect Donald Trump, ostensibly to discuss renewable energy – but we're willing to bet rockets were part of the conversation as well. SpaceX is going to try for a launch of its Falcon Heavy superlifter, and having a friend in government could help the massive rocket get some lucrative payloads. ® Sponsored: DevOps and continuous delivery Tips and corrections 32 Comments More from The Register Weather stops SpaceX from blowing up more satellites Launch lovers and explosion enthusiasts wait another week 31 Comments SpaceX delays manned Dragon capsule launch Setback follows Falcon 9 explosion 22 Comments SpaceX Dragon capsule lands in Pacific carrying 12 moustronauts NASA to watch Musketeer relatives carefully 44 Comments Patience is SpaceX's latest virtue Falcon's return to space delayed until January 16 Comments Dragon capsule bids adios to ISS Departs orbiting outpost today bearing return cargo 10 Comments SpaceX to explosion conspiracy theorists: There's no grassy knoll at Cape Canaveral Video Investigation replicates cryogenic helium #FAIL 18 Comments Whitepapers Building your DLP strategy and process Forcepoint works with its clients around the world to develop effective strategies and processes for implementing data loss prevention (DLP) programs. 5 Steps to Good Governance Why it should be done efficiently and seamlessly, so that employees can focus on more exciting goals—innovative, business-growing goals The platform explosion: harness it or lose agility This report helps enterprise architects navigate the mushrooming software platform market.

The establishment doubles down on the phony ‘Russia hacking’ narrative despite zero evidence Posted on January 6, 2017January 9, 2017 by Bob Livingston Views: 2,867 226 Shares John Harwood, the Hillary Clinton operative who poses as a CNBC correspondent and New  York Times contributor, got a bit of surprise when he put a poll on his twitter feed asking, “Who do you believe America? Wikileaks, or US intel officials.” By more than 2 to 1, respondents chose Wikileaks. Clearly, only the most ignorant and rabid of statists are falling for the notion that Russians hacked the election. Americans are far more savvy than the pundit and political class believe. No amount of talk about closed door intel briefings or open door intel briefings, media claims, Insane John McClain claims or James Clapper pronouncements can cover the fact that fewer and fewer people believe anything emanating from bowels of the cesspool that is Washington, D.C. After all, CNN reports that the FBI was not allowed to examine DNC servers to determine whether hacking took place, much less to discover who might be behind it. Instead, the FBI is taking the word of a private corporation named Crowdstrike. The good people over at Zero Hedge did a little digging into published information available about Crowdstrike and its major players. Crowdstrike’s chief technology officer and co-founder, and the person who wrote a report linking Russia to the DNC hack is a man Dimitri Alperovitch. Previously, Aperovitch was behind a largely debunked report linking the same hackers to alleged hacks of cellphones of Ukrainian artillery by Russians seeking to find their location for bomb targeting. Alperovitch also happens to be a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, a globalist think tank with ties to the Council on Foreign Relations and the Trilateral Commission. The Atlantic Council is funded by the U.S. military along with defense contractors Lockheed Martin, Raytheon, Northop Grumman and Boeing. Also recall that the intelligence community claiming Russian involvement in the DNC email leaks is the same intelligence community that has recently told us such whoppers as weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, Saddam Hussein had ties to al-Qaida, there were moderate rebels in Syria, Bashar Assad used chemical weapons and Russia was bombing civilians in Allepo. Is it any wonder the people – thinking ones, at least – don’t buy the narrative that Russia hacked the election?

Sleep. MORE, Ford chief executive Mark Fields announced that his company had canceled plans to build a $1.6 billion plant in Mexico. ADVERTISEMENT Instead, Ford was going to pump $700 million into Michigan and create 700 new jobs in the process.   “We are encouraged by the pro-growth policies that President-elect Trump and the new Congress have indicated they will pursue,” Fields said: “And we believe that these tax and regulatory reforms are critically important to boost U.S. competitiveness, and, of course, drive a resurgence in American manufacturing and high-tech innovation.” Fields stressed that, unlike Carrier in Indiana, his company had not “struck a deal” with the incoming President. Ford was investing in America because it saw America had a president who was going to put her first. #Ford adds 700 new jobs at Flat Rock Assembly Plant in Mich. to produce high-tech electrified and autonomous vehicles. pic.twitter.com/UHeUTcX73T— Ford Motor Company (@Ford) January 3, 2017 While that was undoubtedly true, one must believe that Fields also sees the writing on the wall. The same day Fields announced Ford’s plans to invest in the country it calls home, Trump tweeted that car companies who make cars overseas to be sold in the U.S. should pay a price. “General Motors is sending Mexican made model of Chevy Cruze to U.S. car dealers-tax free across border. Make in U.S.A. or pay big border tax,” Trump tweeted. General Motors is sending Mexican made model of Chevy Cruze to U.S. car dealers-tax free across border. Make in U.S.A.or pay big border tax!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 3, 2017 Trump was telling U.S. manufactures that his promise to keep manufacturing in the U.S. was about to move from rhetoric to reality. Throughout the 2016 election Trump refused GOP demands that he genuflect to the golden calf of free trade. Instead, Trump mocked politicians who have struck disastrous trade deals that undercut U.S. manufacturing and allowed corporations to move production overseas with no consequence. Since President Bill ClintonBill ClintonDem boycotts of inauguration grow Dems 'outraged' with Comey after House briefing Poll: Trump enters office with historically low approval rating MORE grabbed free trade by the horns and worked with Republicans to enact the North American Free Trade Agreement, the issue of trade has become a truth to be honored; not a policy to be debated. It is under this framework that free traders exiled those who wanted to protect American manufacturing as heretics. Free trade, thus, morphed into a utopian dream in which commerce binds the nations of the world together in a manner that prevents global conflict and advances mankind. It is the same dream peddled by Woodrow Wilson in the aftermath of World War I; it is the same dream that fails to understand human nature. “The thing about trade is, it can feel like a competition, where there’s always a winner and always a loser,” Speaker Paul RyanPaul RyanSchumer puts GOP on notice over ObamaCare repeal GOP must avoid Dems' mistakes when replacing ObamaCare Trump, House GOP could clash over 'Buy America' MORE said in February 2015 in support of giving President Obama “trade promotion authority.” “But really, it’s more like a collaboration because both sides succeed. Otherwise, they wouldn’t do it. More trade means more people from every country, buying, selling, investing, creating — all working together to build a better world.” Ryan is willfully clueless. Nations (other than the United States) enter trade deals that are beneficial and, if they aren’t, find ways around the rules and/or break the deals. China manipulates her currency with no fear of reprisal from free traders like Ryan who fear “trade wars” more than being fleeced. European nations use subsidies to get a leg up on U.S. manufacturing. One need only ask Boeing about how Europe’s illegal subsidization of Airbus has worked for them. And while U.S. “trading partners” steamroll us, Third World nations court U.S. companies like cheerleaders court the all-star high school quarterback. Why stay in America when America doesn’t put out, these nations ask. Why stay in a nation that has an EPA & OSHA looking over your shoulder, demands a minimum wage be paid, and is home to one of the highest corporate tax around? Why buy the American cow when you can get the Third World milk for free? The very reason free trade fails is that nations are inherently tribalistic and corporations are inherently greedy. They are going to put themselves before any ideology. The problem is that the politicians spouting free trade, like Ryan, are so enamored by the dream that they are blind to the reality; a reality the four men on Mount Rushmore warned against. “We allowed foreign countries to subsidize their goods, devalue their currencies, violate their agreements and cheat in every way imaginable, and our politicians did nothing about it,” Trump said during a June 2016 campaign speech in Monessen, Penn. Ryan is one of those politicians. Trump was right in Monessen and he is right today. The president-elect is opening our eyes to a new reality; a reality in which free trade is no longer infallible. When NAFTA was debated we were told those manufacturing jobs that went overseas would never come back. Manufacturing was a sunset industry. Trump, even before he has raised his hand to take the oath of office, is showing that when a president vows to take care of his own those will jobs never leave. It appears the sun is setting on America’s ill-advised flirtation with a failed free trade. Joseph R.

"We're at the final lap within these two weeks," the minister, Liow Tiong Lai told reporters. "We hope we can find the plane." Liow did not specify a date but said that a tripartite meeting will be held after a final report is released when the 120,000 square kilometer (46,000 square mile) search ends. Authorities had previously said the search will end early this year. The last search vessel embarked on its final sweep across the southern Indian Ocean last month. The Malaysian Airlines jet disappeared during a flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing on March 8, 2014, carrying 239 passengers and crew. It is believed that the Malaysian Airlines plane crashed into the Indian Ocean, but an extensive deep-sea hunt off Australia's west coast has failed to find a single piece of debris. The Australian Transport Safety Bureau, which has been leading the search mission, said in a report last month that the Boeing jet is almost certainly not in the current search zone and may be further north. The report was based on a review of evidence by Australian and international experts. Australia has said that it did not view the report findings as credible. The governments of Australia, Malaysia and China, where most of the passengers were from, previously agreed to pull the plug on the operation once the current search area was fully scoured unless "credible new information" emerged. "We cannot just base (a search) on assumptions. We need credible clues to look for the plane," said Liow when asked about the possibility of a search further north. Many families have been long skeptical about whether the ongoing search is in the right place. In a statement late Thursday, the international group of MH370 next-of-kin, Voice 370, called on Malaysia, Australia and China to consider the next step before the current search ends.

While volume growth has been steadily improving, revenues and yields have been slower to rise but improved in the second half of 2016. There is, however, some uncertainty over whether recent growth will continue into 2017. IHS Global Insight managing director of transportation advisory services Chuck Clowdis said, “We really don’t know if we should expect to see a continuation of this growth in 2017 ….” WorldACD reported that exports from China and Hong Kong “played a major role” in November results. Year-over-year volume growth from Hong Kong improved by 30% while Shanghainese volume growth rose 17%. The WorldACD also noted a marked shift in cargo traffic between Europe and Asia-Pacific: [From 2010 to 2016], there was hardly any growth from Asia Pacific to Europe, but growth was 39% in the opposite direction, creating a reversal of the balance: air cargo volumes from Europe to Asia Pacific have now overtaken the volumes in the opposite direction, speaking for the increasing purchasing power of Asia. President-elect Donald Trump’s threats to slap tariffs or taxes on imports have worried some in the industry. IHS Global Insights’ Clowdis told Logistics Management that Trump’s election has increased uncertainty for air freight carriers: [T]here’s also been talk of certain goods shifting manufacturing and assembly to the U.S. from overseas. Will this have a positive or negative impact on air cargo rates and volumes? It’s too hard to predict at this stage. So far Trump has blasted companies like Boeing and Lockheed with charging too much for goods they sell to the U.S. government and slapped carmakers Ford, GM and now Toyota for importing vehicles that could just as well be made in the United States. We have our own list of 10 more companies that could rouse Trump’s ire, mostly for sending manufacturing and service jobs outside the country. A likely possibility is that Congress could enact a Trump plan for a “border adjustment tax.” Such a tax can eliminate the advantages that follow from U.S. firms manufacturing and retaining profits overseas. Such a tax could be trade neutral because changes to prices consumers pay for imported goods would be offset by increased strength in the U.S. dollar. The downside is that U.S. exports then become more expensive. One industry a border adjustment tax would hit particularly hard is energy. The incoming Trump administration has proposed a 20% tax on crude imports while leaving exports untaxed. Energy economist and analyst Philip Verleger estimates that border adjustment taxes would drive the spread between West Texas Intermediate and Brent as high as 25%. A barrel of WTI that costs around $54 today would cost nearly $68 under such a tax scheme. U.S. retail prices would jump and exports of U.S. crude (and even some finished products) would vanish.

Image Credit: Gage Skidmore As Donald Trump has moved from being just another Republican candidate to the president-elect, speculation has intensified about the “loose cannon” approach he appears to take when it comes to using Twitter. Does he just tweet whatever he feels like saying at any moment, or are his tweets crafted by a PR team? According to Sean Spicer, who will soon become the Trump’s press secretary, no one — including Spicer — has any idea what the incoming president is going to say until they see it on Twitter (or get the blowback from one of his statements, presumably). “I do not get a memo [about what the tweets will contain]. He drives the train on this,” Spicer said during an event on Wednesday night in Chicago, according to a report by the Wall Street Journal. The event also included President Obama’s former press secretary, Robert Gibbs, as well David Axelrod, a former Obama adviser. Although Spicer said Trump chooses what to tweet and when, he hasn’t always had that kind of control. His campaign staff took over his Twitter account just before the election, although he regained his control over it after winning the campaign. Spicer said that he checks Trump’s Twitter feed as soon as he wakes up because “it drives the news.” And he suggested that it’s not the incoming president’s job to fact-check everything before he posts it on Twitter. At the same time, however, Spicer rejected the idea that Trump doesn’t consider what he is going to say, or what the potential outcome of his comments might be. It’s a “misconception… that he is just randomly tweeting,” Spicer said. “He is a very strategic thinker.” So far, that strategic thinking has led to a political faux pas involving relations with China, repeated allegations about millions of illegal voters — a claim that has been repeatedly proven false — and what appeared to be a threat that the U.S. would enhance its nuclear-weapons program, followed by a comment encouraging a potential arms race. Trump has also complimented Russian president Vladimir Putin on his political strategy and used his Twitter account to criticize the CIA. The United States must greatly strengthen and expand its nuclear capability until such time as the world comes to its senses regarding nukes — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 22, 2016 Trump’s Twitter comments have also caused often dramatic movements in stock prices, including a drop in Boeing shares after he criticized the company’s Air Force One contract (using inaccurate numbers) and a similar decline after he said the Lockheed-Martin F-35 program was too expensive. After Trump’s remarks about nuclear weapons, senior staff rushed to qualify his comments, saying there were no plans to add more weapons. Similar qualifications were required after Trump suggested he was not confident in the work of the U.S. intelligence community, comments that came just before a report that his administration may cut back or reorganize the existing intelligence agencies in some way — a claim that Spicer says is untrue. Despite the impression that much of his job will consist of trying to put out fires that President Trump starts on Twitter, the incoming press secretary said he didn’t see it that way at all. He described it at the Chicago event as “an exciting part of the job.” Spicer also said that Trump will likely continue to pursue the same approach on Twitter once he becomes the president, because it gives him a direct way to communicate to the American people. The administration is also considering other ways to do this, Spicer said, including reaching out to bloggers and other non-traditional media outlets that aren’t usually part of White House briefings. Trump’s chief of strategy, Steve Bannon, is the chairman of one such outlet known as Breitbart News, a right-wing publication that has boasted about its ties to so-called “alt-right” conservative groups, many of whom advocate a form of economic nationalism that includes overt racism. In any case, if you enjoy the prospect of having the U.S. president pursue various aspects of national and foreign policy via Twitter, and engage in public attacks on those he perceives as his enemies, it would appear that you are in for an exciting four years.

By: AFP | Kuala Lumpur | Published:January 6, 2017 6:58 pm The Malaysian airline MH370 disappeared in March 2014 with 239 people on board. (Source: Reuters) The hunt for missing flight MH370 will end in two weeks, Malaysia’s transport minister said on Friday, as relatives of passengers demanded authorities push on with the search. “We’re at the final lap within these two weeks,” the minister, Liow Tiong Lai told reporters. “We hope we can find the plane.” Watch What Else Is Making News Liow did not specify a date but said that a tripartite meeting will be held after a final report is released when the 120,000 square kilometre search ends. Authorities had previously said the search will end early this year. The last search vessel embarked on its final sweep across the southern Indian Ocean last month. The Malaysian Airlines jet disappeared en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing on March 8, 2014, carrying 239 passengers and crew. It is believed that the Malaysian Airlines plane crashed into the Indian Ocean, but an extensive deep-sea hunt off Australia’s west coast has failed to find a single piece of debris. The Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB), which has been leading the search mission, said in a report last month that the Boeing jet is almost certainly not in the current search zone and may be further north. The report was based on a review of evidence by Australian and international experts. Australia has said that it did not view the report findings as credible. The governments of Australia, Malaysia and China, where most of the passengers were from, previously agreed to pull the plug on the operation once the current search area was fully scoured unless “credible new information” emerged. “We cannot just base [a search] on assumptions. We need credible clues to look for the plane,” said Liow when asked about the possibility of a search further north. Many families have been long sceptical about whether the ongoing search is in the right place. In a statement late Thursday, the international group of MH370 next-of-kin, Voice 370, called on Malaysia, Australia and China to consider the next step before the current search ends. “Extending the search to the new area defined by experts is an inescapable duty owed to the flying public in the interest of aviation safety,” it added.

Build plant in U.S. or pay big border tax“, a tweet which sent shares of Japanese carmakers sliding on Friday with a 1.7% fall for Toyota, 2.2% for Nissan and 3.2% for Mazda, an angry Japanese government and corporate establishment pushed back against Trump’s criticism of Toyota as the attack on the country’s most powerful corporate name sent shockwaves across “Japan Inc.” As the FT notes, CEOs of Japanese companies including Sony’s Kazuo Hirai and Nissan’s Carlos Ghosn weighed in, while analysts feared the president-elect’s targeting of Toyota would lead to a broader fallout on Japan-US trade relations, similar to concerns about an escalating trade war between the US and China. “Toyota is responsible for large employment at US plants such as in Kentucky. It’s questionable whether the new US president has a grasp of how many vehicles Toyota builds in the US,” said Taro Aso, Japan’s finance minister. Hiroshige Seko, minister for trade and industry, added that the Japanese government would do its part to explain to the US administration about the contribution of the country’s car industry to the US economy. “Toyota is equivalent to Japan as a whole, so Mr Trump’s criticism could be interpreted as a message to the Japanese government,” said Koji Endo, motor industry analyst at SBI Securities, expressing concerns about the impact on bilateral trade negotiations once Mr Trump is officially appointed later this month. Analysts said Trump’s focus on Toyota, after Ford this week announced that it would pull plans for a $1.6bn Mexican plant, is not surprising but ironic for the Japanese carmaker who was the latecomer among global rivals in shifting production to Mexico. They noted that Toyota, which has an existing manufacturing facility in Baja to build the Tacoma pick-up truck, only made about 6% of 2.2m vehicles sold in the US in Mexico during the January to November period, compared with 33% for Nissan and 47 per cent for Mazda, according to SBI Securities, both of which companies are said to be far more exposed to Trump’s future ire than Toyota. As the FT adds, in 2015, Toyota announced plans to spend $1 billion building a new facility in the central state of Guanajuato that will make Corolla vehicles from 2019. The decision was a symbolic one for Akio Toyoda, Toyota’s chief executive, as it marked the lifting of a three-year moratorium on plant construction. It also underscored the company’s recovery since Mr Toyoda faced a US congressional grilling in 2010 in the wake a massive recall of spontaneously accelerating Toyota vehicles. Having experienced the US recall crisis and the subsequent political backlash, analysts say Toyota may eventually adjust its strategy in Mexico, either by reducing the planned number of vehicle production or increasing the capacity of existing US plants in Texas or Mississippi. “The company will carefully try to avoid taking action that would leave a negative impression on the new US administration,” said Masahiro Akita, analyst at Credit Suisse. “Considering how Toyota has operated in the past, it wouldn’t be surprising if the company makes a policy shift.” In response to Trump’s tweet, Toyota has said no US jobs would be lost as a result of its planned new plant in Mexico. CEO Toyoda also said the company would “see what policies the incoming president adopts” before deciding whether to take action. Still, Mr Akita said a complete reversal of Toyota’s plan to construct a new plant in Guanajuato was unlikely considering Mr Toyoda’s concerns about the impact on employment and the regional economy. Then again, the Trump twitter effect may soon fizzle according to Reuters Breakingviews, which noted that Toyota’s day in Donald Trump’s crosshairs “could mark peak Twitter-Trump.” On Thursday, the U.S. president-elect threatened tariffs on the Japanese carmaker, if it sold Mexico-made Corollas in the United States. Yet a 2 percent fall in Toyota’s Tokyo-listed shares looks muted considering Ford and General Motors performed as poorly or worse on New York trading. That’s because it quickly became clear Trump had all his facts wrong. The more that happens, the less impact his tweet storms will have. Trump’s bully pulpit, both online and at rallies, can certainly be effective. General Motors, Lockheed Martin and Boeing have all scrambled to respond. This week Ford ditched a plan to build a new plant in Mexico that Trump had slated. In Toyota’s case, a 35 percent import tax on 200,000 Corollas built annually at its new plant in Mexico would add $1.4 billion to their overall cost, assuming a $20,000 sticker price per car. That’s around 10 percent of this year’s expected earnings, which either Toyota or customers would have to swallow. That’s never going to happen, though, for one very simple reason: Toyota’s new plant would replace one in Canada, not America. All Corolla production for U.S. sales remains in the company’s Mississippi factory. The plant is also in Guanajuato, not Baja, as Trump asserted. Getting such basic facts wrong might not bother Trump’s supporters. But shareholders are more likely to get wise to such antics and start focusing on more concrete issues. Contrast Toyota with Constellation Brands, the $30 billion alcoholic drinks firm. Its shares dropped more than 7 percent on Thursday, despite strong earnings. The maker of Corona and other Mexican brews faces higher costs if tax breaks are scrapped for overseas costs. That’s a central tenet of tax reforms sought by congressional Republicans and Trump. And these would be easier to put in place than long-term cross-border tariffs, which break trade agreements. None of this means Trump’s ability to micromanage via social-media bullying is over. But the more his punches fall wide of the mark, the more inclined investors will be to ignore him. While that may eventually pan out, for now the market (and various Trump tweet scanning apps) is far more transfixed by what Trump tweets in his daily social media sermons than even statements made by many if not all Fed members. iShares MSCI Japan ETF (NYSE:EWJ) was unchanged in premarket trading Friday.

(Spencer Platt, Getty Images; John Bazemore / AP; Kamran Jebreili, AP) Robert ReedContact ReporterChicago Tribune Every U.S. presidential administration is a pacesetter, and the same will be true for the incoming Trump administration. Here are business-related trends, large and small, that could end up being considered either "in" or "out" during Donald Trump's regime, which begins with his Jan. 20 presidential inauguration. What's "in": Private jets. Remember the public outcry in 2008 when U.S. auto executives flew in their private planes to ask Washington power brokers for an industry bailout? Throughout the years of the Obama administration, private jets were branded as examples of corporate excess and business jet sales have been lackluster for years. Now, the makers of private aircraft see an ally in Trump, who flies around in his own namesake plane and even prefers it over Air Force One. Industry analysts expect the new president will destigmatize private plane use and that will translate into more business jet orders. Shares of small aircraft makers have gained altitude since Trump's election. What it says about Trump that his neckties are too long Eric Zorn I once picked on Democratic Vice President Al Gore in a column because he claps like a child, so be assured there's nothing partisan in my attack today on Republican President-elect Donald Trump for wearing his neckties like a little boy. When we're young and small and compelled by social circumstance... I once picked on Democratic Vice President Al Gore in a column because he claps like a child, so be assured there's nothing partisan in my attack today on Republican President-elect Donald Trump for wearing his neckties like a little boy. When we're young and small and compelled by social circumstance... (Eric Zorn) Golf. Presidents liking golf is nothing new. Eisenhower, Kennedy, the Bushes, Clinton and Obama all hit the links during their terms. Trump, however, loves the game of golf, which reportedly has an annual U.S. economic impact of nearly $70 billion. His privately held company owns or operates 17 golf courses, some of which host major tournaments. Still, golf has been in the rough for years as the number of younger, recreational players has dipped. But one legendary player, Jack Nicklaus, told Yahoo Finance that Trump will reinvigorate the game and, when it comes to golf, who disagrees with The Golden Bear? Fast food. First lady Michelle Obama strongly advocated on behalf of children and families eating freshly made, healthy and organic foods. President Obama provided wing support. But President-elect Trump? Not so much. Throughout the campaign, he gobbled fast food fare. During a CNN Republican presidential town hall, Trump noted he was an aficionado of Burger King and KFC, but added that what he really enjoys is locally based McDonald's Big Macs, Quarter Pounders with cheese and even the fish. Will the presidential seal be good for the Golden Arches? It could be. Social media. Trump and Twitter. The two have become synonymous in today's real-time information age. Trump shows no signs of easing back on his personal tweets, especially those aimed at U.S. corporations doing something that peeves him. Trump has already lobbed critical tweets at Boeing, Lockheed Martin, General Motors and Toyota. At the very least, CEOs who probably never tweeted in their lives are now aware of the power of social media. They're especially learning how it can turn public opinion, and rattle a company stock price, with just one early morning tweet from the nation's next chief executive. Moonlighting. Although Trump is rich, he is one of millions of Americans supplementing their incomes with second jobs. But instead of renting short-term residential space via Airbnb or driving part time for ride-sharing firms Uber and Lyft, Trump's side gig is being an executive producer of NBC's "The New Celebrity Apprentice." The TV show is an offshoot of the "The Apprentice," which then private citizen Trump hosted and helped to start years ago. In what seems to be a first for a sitting president, Trump's name will appear on the new show's credits. What's "out": Trump says president 'can't have a conflict of interest,' suggests he could continue to run company Elise Viebeck President-elect Donald Trump shrugged off rising concerns Tuesday about the potential conflicts-of-interest between his ongoing participation in the Trump Organization and his future as president, saying the president "can't have a conflict of interest" and that the law is "totally" on his side.... President-elect Donald Trump shrugged off rising concerns Tuesday about the potential conflicts-of-interest between his ongoing participation in the Trump Organization and his future as president, saying the president "can't have a conflict of interest" and that the law is "totally" on his side.... (Elise Viebeck) Conflicts of interest. Typically, when new presidents take office, they put their financial assets into a blind trust and hire somebody to manage them throughout their term. President-elect Trump, a lifelong business executive with a vast array of holdings, is not buying into that traditional approach. He'll soon hold a news conference about how he intends to deal with this issue. What Trump does, or doesn't do, regarding potential conflicts will resonate as an example throughout government and commerce. Business regulations. If President Obama was chided by business leaders for being the great regulator, President-elect Trump is being hailed as the great un-regulator. Trump's vowing to roll back financial, environmental, workplace and other regulations. Ditching many business regulations could boost short-term economic growth but potentially open the door to corporate excess and trouble for taxpayers, as in 2008 when Wall Street and the financial industry had to be bailed out. Overseas trade. "Made in the USA" will be a Trump administration mantra. On the outs will be trade pacts, corporate international expansion and addressing of global issues such as climate control. Trump's core constituency of middle-America workers, who saw manufacturing jobs shipped overseas, will back this strategy. However, the bicoastal tech industry, which depends on China to manufacture its many wares, is worried about what's next. Oh, and there's one more trend: men's business dress. President Obama prefers dark suits, crisp white shirts and neatly knotted solid-colored ties. President-elect Trump dresses in a similar manner with two sartorial differences. While in a suit, Trump will occasionally sport a red baseball cap with a slogan ("Make America Great Again") stitched on it. He also prefers long solid-color ties that go a couple of inches past his belt buckle and look sort of like an airport runway. Already, we're seeing a proliferation of red caps, but those extra-long ties? Thankfully, that craze hasn't caught on, yet. roreed@chicagotribune.com Twitter @reedtribbiz Copyright © 2017, Chicago Tribune Donald Trump Michelle Obama Barack Obama McDonald's Lockheed Martin Corp.

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    China is prepared to step up its scrutiny of U.S. companies in the event President-elect Donald Trump takes punitive measures against Chinese goods and triggers a trade war between the world’s two biggest economies after he takes office, according to people familiar with the matter. The options include subjecting well-known U.S. companies or ones that have large Chinese operations to tax or antitrust probes, the people said, asking not to be identified because the matter isn’t public. Other possible measures include the launch of anti-dumping investigations and scaling back government purchases of American products, according to the people. The move illustrates how the fallout from escalating tensions between the two nations could spread to companies. Trump has made China a frequent target of his attacks and nominated trade-related officials that the Communist Party’s Global Times newspaper said would form an "iron curtain" of protectionism. Any retaliation by China against Trump could be risky. A backlash may result in China damaging access to its biggest trading partner, said Michael Every, head of financial markets research at Rabobank Group in Hong Kong. "When you have a country with a large trade deficit that retaliates against a country with a large trade surplus with it, it’s the country with the trade deficit that wins," said Every. "The country with the surplus loses, every time." America’s trade deficit with China narrowed to $31.1 billion from $32.5 billion in October as U.S. exports to the nation were the strongest since December 2013, according to the most recent data available. That brought the trade deficit to $288.78 billion for the ten months to the end of October. Playing Chicken China’s central government compiled the possible countermeasures after collecting opinions from various departments, the people said. The punitive steps would only be carried out if the U.S. acts first and after senior Chinese leaders sign off on them, they said. In response to Bloomberg queries, China’s Vice Minister of Commerce Wang Shouwen touted the benefits of maintaining good bilateral relations, saying that U.S. investments have not only helped Chinese employment but have also led to immense wealth for American companies. "I believe win-win economic ties between the two nations will keep moving forward," Wang said. "No one wants a lose-lose scenario, and no one will want to harm the win-win ties. I’m still optimistic about future China-U.S. economic relations." Wang also said the Ministry of Commerce will seek to level the playing field for foreign companies pitching to win government contracts and that it wouldn’t discriminate against foreign companies’ products made in China. Representatives at China’s State Administration of Taxation and General Administration of Customs either didn’t respond or couldn’t immediately comment to Bloomberg queries. Representatives at Trump’s transition team didn’t respond to a request for comment. Late last year, China fined General Motors Co., the second-largest foreign carmaker in the country, nearly $30 million for antitrust violations after the company was accused of setting minimum prices on some models made by its SAIC General Motors joint venture. GM said at the time it respects local laws and that it would fully support its venture in China to ensure all appropriate actions are taken. Given how much they have at stake -- Rhodium Group estimates American multinational corporations have poured more than $228 billion into China since 1990 -- U.S. business groups have a history of pushing back against Washington on trade issues with China. In the 1990s, companies including Boeing Co., Motorola Inc. and American International Group Inc. were involved in lobbying efforts in the annual battle to renew China’s most-favored nation status that gave its exports low-tariff status in the U.S. In 2011, trade groups representing companies including Microsoft Corp. and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. lobbied against legislation to pressure China to raise the value of its currency. "Discriminating against foreign companies in the enforcement of laws and regulations harms not just those companies, but also the millions of Chinese who work for them, their local partners and those who use their products and services," said William Zarit, chairman of the Beijing-based American Chamber of Commerce in China. "We urge the governments of both countries to find ways to build trust through increasing transparency, and to establish a level trade and commercial playing field.

REUTERS/Regis Duvignau PARIS Airbus (AIR.PA) reached a target for at least 50 deliveries of its A350 wide-body jetliner in 2016, two industry sources said on Friday. Widely watched deliveries of the newest European long-haul jet had been delayed by problems in supplies of cabin equipment, notably from France's Zodiac Aerospace (ZODC.PA). Airbus declined to comment ahead of an annual news conference on orders and deliveries on Jan 11. It has predicted more than 670 total deliveries for 2016, including at least 50 A350s. It has also predicted it would sell at least as many planes as it delivered in 2016. Rival Boeing (BA.N) was due to issue 2016 data later on Friday, maintaining its position as the world's largest planemaker by the number of units delivered.

News Business Business News Amazon email scam could cost up to £750 - here's what you should look out for One shopper lost £750 after clicking on the link in what looks like an automatic customer email Zlata Rodionova Friday 6 January 2017 09:42 BST Click to follow The Independent Online Emails from Amazon will never ask you for personal information Reuters Amazon customers have been warned they could lose hundreds of pounds if they fall for a “convincing” fake email scam. Action Fraud, the UK’s fraud and cyber-crime centre, said the spoofed emails from “service@amazon.co.uk” claim recipients have made an order online and mimic an automatic customer email notification.  The number of people who have been sent the fake email is unclear, although Action Fraud said it had received several reports about the scam.

In order to get a shopper’s financial information, the email cleverly indicates that if the recipient didn’t authorise the transaction they can click on the supposed help centre link provided to receive a full refund. One shopper lost £750 after clicking on the link. After the victim notified their bank, Nationwide, their credit card was cancelled and the lost money refunded in full. Amazon completes first drone delivery in the UK So what should you look out for to make sure you don’t fall for the scam? Suspicious links Amazon said that scam emails will often contain links to websites that look like Amazon.co.uk, but aren’t Amazon.co.uk. Legitimate sites have a dot before “amazon.co.uk”, such as http://“something”.amazon.co.uk (usually “www”). Sites such as “payments-amazon.com” aren’t Amazon sites. Amazon will also never send emails with links to an IP address (string of numbers), such as “http://123.456.789.123/amazon.co.uk/”. Beware of attachments Don’t click on attachments or prompts to install software on your computer. If you’ve already opened an attachment or clicked a suspicious link, go to Protect Your System. Typos or grammatical errors An official email from Amazon will not contain typos. Delete it. American spellings in emails purporting to be from Amazon in the UK can also be a giveaway. Make sure your computer is configured securely Candid Wüest, Threat Researcher at Symantec, told The Independent: “Configuring popular internet applications such as your web browser and email software is one of the most important areas to focus on.  “The strongest security settings will give you the most control over what happens online but may also frustrate some people with a large number of questions (‘This may not be safe, are you sure you want do this?’) or the inability to do what they want to do. Often security and privacy settings can be properly configured without any sort of special expertise by simply using the ‘help’ feature of your software or reading the vendor’s website.” Gadgets and tech news in pictures 43 show all Gadgets and tech news in pictures 1/43 Engineers test a four-metre-tall humanoid manned robot dubbed Method-2 in a lab of the Hankook Mirae Technology in Gunpo, south of Seoul, South Korea Jung Yeon-Je/AFP/Getty Images 2/43 Engineers test a four-metre-tall humanoid manned robot dubbed Method-2 in a lab of the Hankook Mirae Technology in Gunpo, south of Seoul, South Korea Jung Yeon-Je/AFP/Getty Images 3/43 The giant human-like robot bears a striking resemblance to the military robots starring in the movie 'Avatar' and is claimed as a world first by its creators from a South Korean robotic company Jung Yeon-Je/AFP/Getty Images 4/43 Engineers test a four-metre-tall humanoid manned robot dubbed Method-2 in a lab of the Hankook Mirae Technology in Gunpo, south of Seoul, South Korea Jung Yeon-Je/AFP/Getty Images 5/43 Waseda University's saxophonist robot WAS-5, developed by professor Atsuo Takanishi Rex 6/43 Waseda University's saxophonist robot WAS-5, developed by professor Atsuo Takanishi and Kaptain Rock playing one string light saber guitar perform jam session Rex 7/43 A test line of a new energy suspension railway resembling the giant panda is seen in Chengdu, Sichuan Province, China Reuters 8/43 A test line of a new energy suspension railway, resembling a giant panda, is seen in Chengdu, Sichuan Province, China Reuters 9/43 A concept car by Trumpchi from GAC Group is shown at the International Automobile Exhibition in Guangzhou, China Rex 10/43 A Mirai fuel cell vehicle by Toyota is displayed at the International Automobile Exhibition in Guangzhou, China Reuters 11/43 A visitor tries a Nissan VR experience at the International Automobile Exhibition in Guangzhou, China Reuters 12/43 A man looks at an exhibit entitled 'Mimus' a giant industrial robot which has been reprogrammed to interact with humans during a photocall at the new Design Museum in South Kensington, London Getty 13/43 A new Israeli Da-Vinci unmanned aerial vehicle manufactured by Elbit Systems is displayed during the 4th International conference on Home Land Security and Cyber in the Israeli coastal city of Tel Aviv Getty 14/43 Electrification Guru Dr. Wolfgang Ziebart talks about the electric Jaguar I-PACE concept SUV before it was unveiled before the Los Angeles Auto Show in Los Angeles, California, U.S Reuters 15/43 The Jaguar I-PACE Concept car is the start of a new era for Jaguar.
