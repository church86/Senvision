Business News Home > Business > Business News < Back to SMG 45 Tuesday, 18 October 2016 | MYT 9:39 PM Japanese aerospace parts maker Asahi opens facility in Klang Asahi's new facility will play a role of supporting parts manufacturing for all of Boeing’s commercial airplane programmes. The Reuters photo shows the Boeing Company logo projected on a wall at the "What's Next?" conference in Chicago earlier this month. KUALA LUMPUR: Japanese aerospace parts maker Asahi Kinzoku Kogyo Inc, through Asahi Aero Malaysia Sdn Bhd, has set up an aircraft parts surface treatment facility in Klang -- its first in South-East Asia.  Asahi Aero Malaysia said in a statement that the RM18mil facility, jointly owned with Toyota Tsusho Corp, specialised in cadmium and Zn-Ni plating, as well as boric surifuric and phosphoric acid anodise processing.  Managing director Go Yamanaka said the one-stop processing facility was opened in order to be closer to Asahi’s customers and meet their needs for quality, on-time delivery and greater affordability.  “The new facility will rapidly play a role of supporting parts manufacturing for all of Boeing’s commercial airplane programmes,” he added. Asahi has five facilities in Japan and one in the United States.  It was the first company in Japan to receive the National Aerospace and Defence Contractors Accreditation Programme (Nadcap) certification, a global cooperative accreditation programme for aerospace engineering, defence and related industries, which is a prerequisite to work with companies such as Boeing.  Boeing Commercial Airplanes director of supplier management (Asia) Troy Kim said Asahi is a trusted partner to Boeing.  “They have helped meet Boeing’s requirements for high quality, competitive pricing and on-time delivery while expanding our supply chain capability in South-East Asia,” Kim said. The Malaysian Investment Development Authority has identified the aerospace industry as a key source of growth for the Malaysian economy. Asahi believes that its expertise and investment in aircraft parts surface treatment technology will help expand Malaysia’s manufacturing sector. “We are committed to creating local employment opportunities and aspire to become the employer of choice in Malaysia,” said Yamanaka.  Tags / Keywords: Airlines , Boeing , Asahi Aero Malaysia Sdn Bhd Related Stories Boeing Q3 profit jumps, raises revenue forecasts Boeing Q3 profit jumps; raises delivery and revenue outlook Airbus net orders fall as it draws line under Kingfisher failure MAS orders RM22b jets Boeing's US$2bil charge may not be its last hard landing You May Be Interested Al-`Aqar Healthcare REIT selling Johor property for RM100m Malaysian palm oil/Vegoils: Market factors to watch Monday Nov 14 Trading ideas: IOI Properties, CAM, IHH, WCT Where are you on the journey to financial freedom?

The 424,000-square-foot building will serve as site to manufacture parts of the 777X, the next generation of the massive, twin-engine wide-body jet Boeing first delivered 21 years ago. The parts the St. Louis plant will produce are separate from the forward fuselage, engine nacelles and pylons that Spirit AeroSystems in Wichita manufactures for the Boeing 777 – and the 777X when production begins in 2017. Specifically, St. Louis will produce the 777X’s wing edge and parts of its empennage, or tail, all made from composites. facebook twitter email Share More Videos 1:35 Textron AirLand Scorpion in the air Pause 1:25 First flight of Citation Longitude super-midsize jet 1:18 Cessna Citation Longitude test pilot 7:07 Marshall breaks down big Shocker win 0:26 Nov. 14 supermoon is closest moon to Earth since 1948 3:17 Shockers won big over Long Beach State 1:39 Who is BTK? 0:23 Klutzy robber sets self ablaze in convenience store heist 5:11 Michael O'Donnell wins County Commission race 0:36 Possible assault in Valley Center Share Video Video link: Select Embed code: Select facebook twitter email Boeing 777X St. Louis manufacturing Crews move an autoclave, used to harden aircraft parts made of composites, to Boeing's new 424,000-square-foot composite center in St. Louis, where workers will manufacture the 777X's composite wing edge and parts of its tail. (Video courtesy of Boeing Co. and Unbridled Media) jsiebenmark@wichitaeagle.com   Boeing’s St. Louis site, which it acquired from its 1997 merger with McDonnell Douglas, has largely been a center of production of military aircraft, including more than 12,000 fighter jets. “With the opening of this new composite center, our well-trained, high-quality workforce is able to demonstrate its versatility and expertise, positioning our region for additional commercial and defense work in the future,” Bob Ciesla, vice president and 777X program manager, said in a statement. Boeing spent $300 million on the new facility, which it said will have about 700 workers supporting it in the next four years. Final assembly of the 777X will be done at Boeing’s Everett, Wash., plant. Unlike the current generation 777, the 777X will have a composite wing and new, GE9X engines that Boeing says will be 5 percent more efficient than other engines in its class. The first 777X delivery is expected in 2020. Boeing so far has 320 orders and commitments for the airplane that will come in two variants: the 777-8, which will have seating for 350 passengers and a 9,300 nautical-mile range; and the 777-9, with seating for 400 passengers and a range of 8,200 nautical miles.

  Home U.K. News Sports U.S. Showbiz Australia Femail Health Science Money Video Travel Columnists Wires Home My Profile Logout Login Feedback DailyMail NEW ARTICLESHomeTop Share show ad New Boeing 737 economy seat supplier books initial sales By Reuters Published: 16:26 EST, 17 October 2016 | Updated: 16:26 EST, 17 October 2016 e-mail By Alwyn Scott NEW YORK, Oct 17 (Reuters) - A new supplier of economy-class seats for Boeing Co's top-selling 737 jetliners has signed its first two airline customers, allowing it to begin production, a person familiar with the matter said on Monday. The agreements with Huntington Beach, California-based LIFT by EnCore, which are due to be announced as early as this week, are the first in which Boeing buys the seats from the supplier, known as "seller-furnished equipment," essentially guaranteeing they will arrive on time. With other seat makers, which include B/E Aerospace and Zodiac Aerospace, airlines are required to buy the seats and have them delivered to aircraft factories, a process that has led to problems for the plane makers when seat deliveries are late. European plane maker Airbus made a similar move in 2015 when it chose German seat maker Recaro to supply seats for the A320 family. Recaro and LIFT are privately held. LIFT's initial orders will equip at least 50 of Boeing's 737 MAX aircraft with seats designed for the Boeing 737 Sky Interior, with deliveries beginning in 2017, said the source, who could not be named because the negotiations are private. The airline customer names could not be learned. The deals for seats on Boeing's top-selling 737 show initial market acceptance and would allow LIFT to begin certification and production, the source said. Boeing's choice of LIFT as its sole seller-furnished seat supplier prompted drops in B/E Aerospace and Zodiac shares when the deal became public in April. Boeing currently has orders for 4,350 of its 737 jetliners. Boeing declined to comment on LIFT's orders, but said it is seeking new seat suppliers to solve capacity problems that have hampered its assembly lines in the past. "To bring more capacity into the market ... we are looking for and helping to develop more seat companies," Boeing spokeswoman Jessica Kowal said. Boeing shares were up 0.37 percent at $134.00 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Boeing also has been working with Chinese seat maker Ali-Jiatai, which delivered its first set of 737 seats to a Chinese airline over the summer, Kowal said. LIFT by EnCore, founded in 2011, has not delivered seats before. Founders Tom McFarland and Jim Downey sold their previous company, C&D Aerospace, to Zodiac in 2005. EnCore has produced galleys and other aircraft fixtures for customers such as Southwest Airlines.

He said the operation of these routes would likely to start in next summer that is from March 28. Replying to a query, Meraj said now Biman has 12 Boeing new generation aircraft in its fleet by which it can operate more flights. On the other hand, the state-owned carrier has initiated a process to lease two more Boeing 737-800 aircraft by December this year. It has taken the move to replace two decades-old aircraft Airbus A310-300 that were grounded last month. Shakil Meraj said the process is under way to lease the two Boeing 737-800 aircraft for “a long period”. “We are optimistic of completing the process by December this year,” he hoped. He said several companies have submitted proposals after Biman had invited the request for proposal (RFP). “Now, we are evaluating the proposals and the appropriate one would be picked soon,” he added. With the inclusion of the two new aircraft in its fleet, the total number of aircraft of Biman will be 14. “Now, Biman fleet is younger and stronger,” said the Biman general manager. Besides, Biman has an agreement with Boeing for two modern and updated Boeing 787 Dreamliners which would be added to the carrier by 2019. “The Dreamliners would strengthen Biman’s capability for long-haul routes,” said Shakil Meraj. “With the Dreamliners, Biman would operate more long-haul routes like New York and Sydney,” he added. Earlier, Biman had brought four new 777-300 ER aircraft from Boeing as part of its modernisation initiative. Later, the national carrier procured two Boeing 777-200 ER aircraft, four Boeing 737-800 aircraft and two Dash  8-Q400 aircraft to strengthen its fleet.     Biman planning to spread wings to China, Sri Lanka, Maldives BSS Biman Bangladesh Airlines is planning to expand its destination to four new routes - China, Sri Lanka and the Maldives in March next year, reports BSS.

Investors don't seem to have noticed. Adam Levine-Weinberg (TMFGemHunter) Oct 17, 2016 at 1:30PM Embraer rolled out the first E190-E2 earlier this year. Image source: Embraer. Whenever an aircraft manufacturer introduces a new model, it risks cannibalizing demand for its existing products. This is aggravated by the length of development cycles in the industry -- it usually takes more than five years for production of a new model to ramp up. As a result, maintaining stable production rates during model transitions is very challenging. Boeing (NYSE:BA) has learned this lesson the hard way with its 777 aircraft program. While it had hoped to maintain production at 8.3 aircraft per month through the transition to the 777X, Boeing has been forced to reduce production to seven per month in 2017 due to slow sales. Many analysts believe that Boeing will have to cut production further in 2018 or 2019. By contrast, Embraer (NYSE:ERJ) is doing an excellent job of transitioning from the first-generation E-Jets to the new E2-series models. It isn't getting any credit for this success, though. Embraer shares have lost half of their value in the past two years. Embraer Stock Performance, data by YCharts. A tough transition After a stretch of slow sales, by late 2012, Embraer's backlog had fallen to its lowest level in more than six years. Many analysts were worried that it would have to drastically reduce production. The company reeled in a boatload of orders from U.S. regional airlines during 2013. However, Embraer also launched the E2 series of its E-Jets product line during the year. The new versions will offer up to 24% improvements in fuel efficiency, which clearly could deter airlines from buying the outgoing model. Maintaining a smooth transition was particularly essential for Embraer because the E-Jets are its only commercial aircraft family in production. By contrast, Boeing can fall back on its other models to offset slumping 777 production. Embraer pulls a rabbit out of the hat Impressively, Embraer has managed to land order after order for its current-generation E-Jets over the past three years. Most of its orders have come from U.S. regional airlines looking to refresh their fleets with the market-leading E175, but it has also received dozens of orders from airlines in Europe and Asia. U.S. regional airlines have ordered hundreds of E175s since early 2013. Image source: Republic Airways. Thus, there has been more than enough demand for Embraer to hold production steady. In fact, Embraer has been ramping up its commercial jet deliveries lately. After delivering 92 E-Jets in 2014, Embraer delivered 101 in 2015 and expects further growth in 2016 to 105-110 deliveries. To win these orders, Embraer has had to offer bigger discounts, but it has hardly faced drastic pricing pressure. Its commercial aviation segment continues to earn double-digit margins: something that Boeing hasn't been able to deliver in recent memory. Looking ahead to 2017, Embraer has already locked in nearly all of its production, although it will probably end up delivering somewhat fewer aircraft than in 2016. Embraer has also sold about 65% of its planned production for 2018, the last year for which E1-series planes are likely to represent the majority of its output. Other headwinds are fading Embraer's weak stock performance over the past two years can probably be traced to disappointments outside its commercial jet business. The executive jet market has been weak for years. Overproduction has led to severe pricing pressure, undermining profitability. Meanwhile, revenue for Embraer's defense segment plunged last year, due to a combination of budget cuts in Brazil and the impact of the weak Brazilian real. Finally, Embraer recently took a $200 million charge to reflect the cost of settling a years-long corruption probe. However, all of these problems should fade in the next year or two. Embraer recently reduced its workforce by about 9% through voluntary buyouts, which will help offset margin pressure in the executive jet and defense businesses. Additionally, Embraer's new KC-390 multi-role military plane should be ready for its first delivery in 2018, driving a return to growth for the defense segment. As Embraer gets its other business segments back on track, the strength of its commercial aviation business should start to shine through. With 272 firm orders and another 400 options and letters of intent, Embraer's E2-series E-Jets are on their way to becoming a big success. Embraer has almost completed the difficult step of lining up a smooth transition to the new generation of jets. Sooner or later, investors are bound to recognize this achievement.

To expedite the handling process, the container was loaded on board the AN-124 freighter using one of Volga-Dnepr's bespoke loading ramps. From Paine Field, the unit was transported to the nearby Boeing factory in Everett. In July 2016, Boeing and Volga-Dnepr Group finalised a cooperation agreement, which involved the group's subsidiaries AirBridgeCargo Airlines (ABC) and Volga-Dnepr Airlines providing long-term logistics support for Boeing Commercial Airplanes using its B747-8 and AN-124 freighters.  The agreement also included Volga-Dnepr Group confirming an order for 20 new B747-8 freighters, which will join the ABC fleet.     www.volga-dnepr.com www.boeing.com www.airbridgecargo.com Comments Post a comment Be the first to comment on this.

American Airlines became the first U.S. carrier to offer such a seat on Oct. 4. That's when it began flying an entirely new "premium economy" cabin on its first Boeing 787-9 "Dreamliner" aircraft. The 787-9 is the second version of the Dreamliner to fly for American, joining the smaller 787-8 variant that's already in its fleet. But it's the 787-9 that now offers American's premium economy cabin, which will eventually expand to more of the planes American uses for long-haul international flying. Today in the Sky recently took to the air in American's new premium economy cabin, checking it out on an Oct. 14 domestic flight between Los Angeles and Dallas/Fort Worth. American's premium economy seats will transition to international flights next month. In the meantime, you can review the seats yourself in the photos above. The seats mark a notable change for travelers on U.S. airlines. Until now, "premium economy"' has meant little more than the same old economy seat with a bit of extra legroom. There have been moderate other perks, such as enhanced snack options or priority boarding. But the experience has been more "economy with a snack" than anything approaching an actual premium cabin. With American’s new premium economy cabin, fliers will notice a distinct difference. It bears little semblance to typical economy, instead looking more like "business-class lite." Gone are the economy seats. Instead, customers will find recliner seats that look more like what one would expect in domestic first-class. They feature extra seat width, additional recline, individual armrests and a lot more legroom. USA TODAY Premium economy: Is it worth the upgrade? The new premium economy cabin is set up in its own private mini-cabin: 21 seats arranged in a 2-3-2 configuration that sit right behind the (admittedly much swankier) business class cabin and ahead of economy. The experience is noticeably roomier than standard coach, making this particular three-hour flight much more pleasant. But this product wasn’t meant for three-hour flights. The jet will soon shift to long-haul intercontinental flights, where airlines sense demand for a product that is better than economy but not as pricey as business class. American's new cabin goes beyond the seat. The airline also will introduce a number of "soft product" perks to the premium economy experience. Better meals, free alcohol, amenity kits, a free checked bag and noise-reducing headphones are among the additional features premium economy fliers can expect on long-haul flights. For seasoned travelers used to premium economy on international carriers, American’s effort isn't ground-breaking. Such cabins have existed in various forms since the early 1990s, when it was added by Taipei-based EVA Air and British carrier Virgin Atlantic. Those earlier iterations, which U.S. carriers had never evolved from until now, focused on little more than extra legroom. But as the chasm between business class and economy has grown in recent years, a middle ground has taken root. A number of Asian and European airlines have already added the version of premium economy similar to what American is now introducing. USA TODAY Delta: New international premium economy cabin coming next year USA TODAY Singapore Airlines gives a boost to premium economy American may be the first U.S airline to introduce a "true" premium economy cabin, but it won’t be the only one. Delta Air Lines is also planning to join the pack with its own such version, expected to come sometime in 2017. The moves promises to make the two U.S. carriers more competitive with global airlines like Lufthansa, Air France, British Airways, Singapore Airlines and others that already have such cabins. American’s new premium cabin will begin flying internationally next month on routes to Sao Paulo and Madrid. For those that can’t wait that long to give it a try, American is currently breaking in the cabin through the end of October on flights between Dallas/Fort Worth and Los Angeles. The airline stressed that passengers on those domestic runs will not receive the full experience, only the seat. Long-term pricing for the new cabin isn't yet clear. For now, American is selling the seats as Main Cabin Extra, a name given to the airline’s standard extra legroom offering in economy. A quick search on some early long-haul routes showed the newest premium economy seats going for between $150 and $200 extra, one way. Prices hovered around $70, one-way, for a domestic flight. By comparison, similar premium economy cabins on other airlines typically sell for several hundred dollars above the base economy fare, though they are often dramatically cheaper than business-class fares. Eventually, American's soft launch of the product is expected to give way to the carrier selling it as a distinctly different cabin.

The center is a visible representation of the company’s efforts to diversify and grow its St. Louis-area operations. The 424,000-square-foot facility will initially build composite parts for the company’s newest commercial jetliner, the 777X. Boeing has committed more than $300 million in company funds to construct and outfit the center. “Boeing has had a presence in St. Louis for nearly 80 years. We’ve built more than 12,000 fighter jets here,” said Bob Ciesla, vice president and program manager for the 777X St. Louis work. “With the opening of this new composite center, our well-trained, high-quality workforce is able to demonstrate its versatility and expertise, positioning our region for additional commercial and defense work in the future.” Production of 777X wing edge and empennage parts will begin at the new composite center in early 2017. The first 777X delivery is expected in 2020. As a result of this 777X work in St. Louis, a total of approximately 700 jobs are expected to be generated in production, engineering, and multiple support areas by the early 2020s timeframe.

(AP Photo/Ted S. Warren) UPDATED at 1 p.m. Tuesday with information from new finance reports Political friction over the Iran nuclear deal has filtered down to the race for Missouri treasurer, with Republican Eric Schmitt and Democrat Judy Baker at odds over how far the state should go in restricting financial ties to the Mideast nation. Whether Boeing Co.’s agreement to build 80 passenger planes for Iran should spur the state to block tax credits for the firm is among various issues in the down-ballot Nov. 8 election contest. Schmitt, a state senator from Glendale, says Boeing should be barred from getting up to $229 million in tax credits pledged previously by the state if it maintains and expands employment in Missouri. “I don’t think any taxpayer dollars should go to any company that does business with Iran,” Schmitt says, noting that the country remains on a State Department list of terrorism-sponsoring nations despite the lifting of some international sanctions. Baker, a former state representative from Columbia, opposes ending the state tax credit package for Boeing, saying that such a move could kill Missouri jobs. She said she supported a longstanding policy in the treasurer’s office that prohibits investing state money in terrorism-related nations. But when a U.S. company sells planes to Iran, she said, “we’re not giving money to Iran, money is coming to us.” Moreover, she said, yanking tax credits after they’re awarded sends a message to companies in general that the state’s business climate is unstable. The treasurer’s office doesn’t oversee the Boeing tax credit package but is in charge of some investment of state dollars. Also in the race are Libertarian nominee Sean O’Toole of Kansas City and Green Party candidate Carol Hexem of St. Louis County. Democratic incumbent Clint Zweifel is barred by state law from seeking a third four-year term. Schmitt, 41, a lawyer, and Baker, 56, a former health care administrator and college economics teacher, both cite their experience. Schmitt, a senator since 2009, had a key role restricting municipal court fines and mandating cuts in the state income tax when state revenue reaches a certain level. He also sponsored a new law giving families the ability to open a tax-exempt savings account for expenses related to a disability — a program overseen by the treasurer’s office. He also cites his chairing a Senate panel on economic development. “Running for state treasurer is an extension of that service,” said Schmitt, who got started in elective office as a Glendale alderman. Baker, during her 2005-2008 House tenure, also was an active lawmaker. She tried unsuccessfully to get the GOP-run Legislature to do things such as keep carbonated beverages out of school vending machines and bar younger teen drivers from using cellphones. She worked with a state agency to offer online drivers education for teens after her bill didn’t pass. She laid groundwork for requiring physical education in schools, which passed the year after she left the Legislature to run for Congress — a race she narrowly lost in 2008. While in the House, she said, she started a bipartisan caucus on economic problems keeping people in poverty. She said she would bring to the treasurer’s office the same focus on helping lower-income working families. “Most people have jobs, some have two, some have three, and still can’t make ends meet,” she said at a campaign stop last week at Greater Mount Carmel Missionary Baptist Church in St. Louis. She plans a statewide program — perhaps jointly funded by the state and private entities — to open a $50 bank account for every kindergartner, regardless of family income. The program would be paired with a financial literacy education effort for elementary and high school students. Voters guide:  Detailed looks at the candidates and issues Baker as treasurer also would provide “equal-pay tool kits” for businesses to assess whether women and minority employees are treated fairly. She and Schmitt both say they’ll work to make online information on state finances more understandable to residents and to increase access to information about unclaimed bank accounts. Baker suggests doing that when Missourians renew vehicle licenses. Schmitt says his experience raising an autistic son, Stephen, spurred him to get involved in public service. With bipartisan support, he won passage of a 2010 bill requiring insurance companies to cover autism treatment. “There’s plenty that divides us, but these are the kind of things that should bring us together,” Schmitt says in a TV ad which began running Tuesday. Schmitt first commented about rescinding Boeing tax credits, some of which stem from a 2013 bill he sponsored, when asked last month by a reporter in Columbia. At the time, he said, he was discussing his push in the Legislature earlier this year for a constitutional amendment barring state and local government investment in companies doing business with Iran and other nations on the terrorism list. The unsuccessful measure didn’t deal with tax credits. Schmitt said that if someone in the Legislature next year proposed doing that, he would support it. The treasurer’s office policy prohibits investments by the state in companies known to back terrorism or which “aid the government” in countries that sponsor terrorism. Baker said that policy had worked well and that she would stick with it. Meanwhile, Schmitt has attacked Baker on the Affordable Care Act, noting that she was regional administrator of the federal Department of Health and Human Services during President Barack Obama’s first term. In that job, he said, Baker was “the architect of Obamacare in Missouri.” He contends the law has resulted in higher health insurance premiums. Baker said she played no role in creating the program but did help prepare educational materials on it. She said that she supported the program but that fixes were needed, including cutting costs by focusing reimbursements on quality and value instead of quantity of care. Meanwhile, Baker criticizes Schmitt for opposing Medicaid expansion, which backers say would bring more federal dollars to Missouri and spur new health care jobs. “I want to create jobs in Missouri, and he is killing jobs,” Baker said. Schmitt has a big fundraising lead in the race. Updated finance reports submitted Monday showed Schmitt raising about $3 million and Baker about $551,000 throughout the campaign. The reports cover activity through the end of last month. The reports also showed Schmitt had $2.5 million on hand left to spend and Baker with $350,314. See who is making donations to candidates in Missouri Nevertheless, Baker said she would be able to afford enough commercials to get her message across. Meanwhile, the Libertarian nominee, O’Toole, wants to stop state efforts to get businesses to move from other states with negotiated incentives. Instead, he wants to make Missouri more attractive to business by ending the state income tax and business and occupational licensing. He also wants to end a state program that makes deposits in banks agreeing to issue low-interest loans to small businesses. He said that was unfair to competing banks. Hexem, of the Green Party, said she would establish an ombudsman’s office to advise student borrowers and represent their concerns to the Legislature. She also said she would fight for better options for low-income housing and to reduce homelessness, from the treasurer’s seat on a state housing commission.

"These talks include detailed and complicated technical as well as legal aspects," he told ICANA news agency. "Both Airbus and Boeing had applied to the US Treasury for permit to sell airplanes to Iran. The permits were the major issue, but they have been granted now." Boeing’s Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg recently said his company make take one to three years to deliver airplanes to Iran. According to US law, any company using a minimum 10 percent of US-made parts in their products should have a Treasury authorization to sell the products to Iran. The sale of passenger airplanes and their parts to Iran was banned by the US after the group "Muslim Student Followers of the Line of Imam" stormed the US Embassy in Tehran in 1979 in what came to be known as Iran hostage crisis.

Mounir takes over from John Wojick, who will retire in 2017. Ihssane Mounir will be responsible for sales and marketing of all airliners and related services to airlines and leasing companies, in all markets worldwide. This nomination will come with big challenges for the Moroccan expatriate, as Boeing is striving to keep up with other aviation giants, such as Airbus. According to the American news source Seattle Times, Boeing needs to sell more Boeing 777s to avoid serious production cuts on the jet line. Mounir has a reputation of being an “unusually able and aggressive executive”, as described by the Seattle Times. Ray Conner, the President and Chief Operating Officer of Boeing Commercial Airplanes, said in a statement that Mounir is “a seasoned sales leader.” The 45-year-old executive joined Boeing in 1997 as a senior aerodynamics engineer. His talent in sales oriented him toward the company’s business side, where he sold jets in Africa, Latin America, Europe, Russia, and Asia. At the age of 17, Ihssane Mounir set foot in the United States with no knowledge of the English language. Wichita State University offered him a conditional acceptance to study aerospace engineering. Therefore, he studied English at a language school in Wichita, Kansas. Subsequently, he was admitted into Wichita State University, where he obtained bachelor’s and master’s degrees in aerospace engineering. Mounir’s nomination comes few days after the signing ceremony, chaired by King Mohamed VI at the Royal Palace of Tangier, of a draft agreement for the establishment of a Boeing industrial ecosystem in Morocco. The structuring project will allow the Moroccan aviation industry to improve its position significantly at the international level. Join the Conversation. What do you think?

Updated: November 13, 2016 @ 10:53 pm Full Forecast Close A man walks out of the Export-Import Bank of the United States in Washington, D.C., on July 28, 2015. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin, File) top story Reporter's Notebook: Ex-Im Bank again stymied by political gridlock By Mai Hoang maihoang@yakimaherald.com Mai Hoang Oct 16, 2016 (…) A man walks out of the Export-Import Bank of the United States in Washington, D.C., on July 28, 2015. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin, File) YAKIMA, Wash. -- Nearly a year ago, Dan Roberts was at Boeing in Seattle celebrating the reauthorization of the Export-Import Bank. Roberts is general manager of Yakima’s Manhasset Specialty Co., one of many small businesses nationwide that benefited from the federal agency, which makes and funds loans to enable countries to purchase U.S. goods. Reauthorization of the Ex-Im Bank, which came as part of a $305 billion transportation bill, was to last until 2019, a welcome extension for Roberts, who had been tapped by Washington state representatives to tout the bank’s benefits for smaller businesses. That’s because the bank’s critics, primarily Republican lawmakers, spent months stalling reauthorization, calling it “corporate welfare” for larger companies such as Boeing. But in the last few months, the Ex-Im Bank has again fallen victim to political gridlock. Its five-member board has dropped to two, one short of a quorum, leading to a $10 million limit in the loans the bank can approve. Meanwhile, efforts to confirm President Barack Obama’s nominee to the bank, which was made back in January, have stalled. And the lack of a quorum has opponents calling for the bank’s demise, again. Roberts said Manhasset, whose transactions don’t reach $10 million, hasn’t been hurt by the funding limit. But recent events reinforce the need of the business community — with the help of supportive federal legislators from this state — to continue to tout the bank’s benefits to small businesses such as Manhasset, which exports its music stands to more than 20 countries. Roberts is personally frustrated by the continued gridlock and the uncertainty it’s creating. “I think everyone felt great that there was the reauthorization of the bank,” he said. “Now with the lack of follow-up action ... it is really frustrating to see that’s not the case. There’s still a great deal left not resolved.” Take the survey Later this month, I’m running a story package exploring the minimum wage and Initiative 1433, which aims to raise that wage to $13.50 an hour by 2020 in Washington state. As part of this effort, I would love to hear from you. I am collecting thoughts on the minimum wage and I-1433 through a short online survey. I am also seeking people willing to do a brief video interview. If interested, provide your contact information when prompted. To access and fill out the survey, go to http://bit.ly/yhrminimumwage.

November 14, 2016 0728 GMT Home Iran Africa Asia Europe International U.S. Middle East Culture Business Health Sport Society Video News ID:170541 Publish Date: Tue, 18 Oct 2016 18:54:12 GMT Service: Iran Boeing, Airbus grant Iran 'maintenance, part manufacturing' permits Airline industry giants Airbus and Boeing granted Iran permissions for plane maintenance and repair operations and manufacturing spare parts, announced the secretary of Society of Iranian Airlines. Maqsoud Asadi-Samani told Mehr News on Tuesday that a draft of a deal with the two giant holdings had stipulated the permissions for Iranian airline industries — a demand long overdue.  "The negotiations with Airbus and Boeing authorities had been underway at a satisfactory pace. In the negotiations, a possibility was addressed under which a Japanese and an American bank would finance Iran's deal with Airbus and Boeing in which billions of dollars would be at stake," he added. Asadi-Samani rejected claims by the airline industry community that Iran suffered lack of necessary permits by air industry giants which would permit repair and maintenance activities in Iran. "It is far too early to make untimely claims about that possibility, and would be legally inaccurate. The buyer, according to the conventions, would receive such rights and we believe the agreements as well are not silent about that, and Iran has received maintenance, repairs, and spare part manufacturing permissions," he underlined. President Hassan Rouhani's visit to Paris was a turning point in Iran's deal with Airbus, a European air industry giant, during which he effectively hammered out a lucrative deal with the company to buy brand new planes to refurbish Iran's antiquated air fleet. Iran still works to make operative a deal to buy aircraft from the two companies. Iran's vision for renewal of its air fleet is rather ambitious, with 118 Airbus and 108 Boeing planes which would transform the country's airline industry into a new world class quality. Under new conditions, the government should turn to domestic companies to provide them with new technology coming from outside through agreements on making such transfers possible. During the four decades of sanctions during which Iran had not bought new planes, Iranian planes still succeeded in landing in European airports, with few exceptions.     KeyWords Boeing Airbus permit   Comments Comment Name: Email: Comment: Security Key: Latest News Iran, Russia cooperating on Middle East issues: Larijani EU must play more active role on regional, global issues: Zarif Iran beats USA in world kabaddi meet to reach semifinals Iran seeks secure, stable Iraq: Parliament speaker Iran crowned at 1st world Pahlavani bouts Iran fit enough to win world physique title Top Iranian, Russian parliamentarians meet in Tehran President Rouhani inaugurates three oilfields in Khuzestan Official: Over 1m Iranians enter Iraq for Arba’een rituals Iran to join Paris climate change treaty Most Visited Trump looking at 'quick ways' to ditch Paris climate accord: Report Protests erupt in Cincinnati after mistrial in police shooting of black male Sanders popular policies could have made him president: Analyst www.irandailyonline.com All rights reserved by iran Daily Online Copyright Page Generated in 0/3213 sec

They soon could be if you book this quirky new party package offered by Middlesbrough College. At the themed birthday celebration, children are given the chance to check in, wear cabin crew uniform and then board the college’s own mock 757 jet - that was once part of an actual Boeing. As well as that they’ll be given safety demonstrations, the chance to use the on board equipment and given in flight food and treats from the trolley. Julie King, commercial booking officer at the college, says other party packages at the venue will include a nail and hair pamper package in the college’s own salon, a cupcake party and a pizza-making party. She said: “We have been running a range of children’s parties here at the college for the past four years. “We started out with our very successful football parties hosted on the AstroTurf pitches and these proved successful for both parents due to their affordable prices and children with the fun-filled content." Middlesbrough College set to offer 'plane parties' for children Middlesbrough College set to offer 'plane parties' for children She added: “We also host a summer school during August which features dozens of exciting day activities for children to keep entertained whilst learning in holidays. “Middlesbrough College principal and chief executive Zoe Lewis was keen to replicate the success of this party and the summer school across the college to appeal to a wider range of children.” The Boeing 757 aircraft was salvaged by Tees Valley specialists Sycamore Aviation and installed in the college to create a life-like training environment. Julie added: “I was approached by Carole Bennett, director of sport, travel and public services, who felt it would be a brilliant idea to incorporate our brand new simulated aircraft cabin into children’s parties. “Once part of a Boeing 757 aircraft, this is a unique party for children. Middlesbrough College set to offer 'plane parties' for children Middlesbrough College set to offer 'plane parties' for children “We try to make our parties as fun and educational so that children go home with fantastic memories. “We’d love to inspire children to new career paths in their future such as the travel and tourism industry!” After the fun on the plane the young guests are then taken through to ‘arrivals’ and given birthday cake. The new range of parties will be available from January. There is a fixed price of £180 for up to 16 children for the plane party, which includes party invites.

Feared mercenary commander was killed in explosion in his apartment block as masked ‘Nazi’ group vows more assassinations  Arseniy Pavlov, known as Motorola, was killed by a bomb in his Donetsk apartment on Sunday A video purportedly showing anti-Moscow fighters claiming to have 'liquidated' Motorola has emerged Experts believe, however, that Russia may be behind the killing, possibly because of his knowledge about the MH17 attack Other theories include allegations that he was murdered in an effort to reignite tensions in the Ukraine, or because of a black market dispute  By Will Stewart and Dave Burke For Mailonline Published: 04:56 EST, 18 October 2016 | Updated: 05:44 EST, 18 October 2016 e-mail 65 shares 208 View comments A pro-Moscow warlord was killed because he knew who shot down flight MH17, killing nearly 300 passengers and crew, according to disturbing new claims. New video purporting to show a pro-Ukrainian death squad giving a Nazi salute after killing warlord Arseniy Pavlov, nicknamed Motorola, has emerged. But doubts have been voiced about whether Ukrainian forces were behind the 33-year-old's killing - with some commentators suspecting Moscow carried out the assassination. Scroll down for video  A video was released by supposedly anti-Moscow fighters claiming to have killed warlord Arseniy Pavlov, nicknamed Motorola The killers were seen doing a Nazi salute after announcing that Pavlov, 33, had been 'liquidated' Motorola, pictured on his wedding day with bride Elena Kolenkina, died in the attack on Sunday The death of the Russian-born mercenary commander - a key figure in the self-proclaimed Donetsk Peoples Republic (DPR) defence forces - has prompted warnings of violent retribution and a return to war between Russian rebels and Ukraine. Pavlov died alongside a bodyguard on Sunday when an improvised bomb detonated in a lift in his Donetsk apartment block. Bloodstains were seen on the road outside after the men were removed from the lift. There are suggestions his death on Sunday could have been ordered by the Kremlin because he 'knew too much' about the downing of the Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777 by a BUK missile in July 2014. His bride reportedly wore a handgun under her bridal gown, and also brandished a Kalashnikov on their wedding day RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Putin says the West can 'screw themselves' over the threat...

Share this article Share 65 shares Russian journalist Yulia Latynina linked his death directly to his knowledge as a field commander of those guilty of shooting down MH17. Pavlov was 'the one who knew who hit the Boeing', she said. It has also been suggested that Russian forces want to purge figures linked to war crimes.  Alex Kokcharov, a Ukraine and Russia risk analyst at London-based IHS Markit defence and security consultancy, said Moscow may want 'more acceptable civilian faces not directly implicated in MH17 or war crimes'. Pavlov and a bodyguard were killed in his apartment block in Donetsk after a bomb exploded in a lift Arseniy Pavlov, well known as warlord Motorola, was 'paranoid' about his security and that of his family, according to sources in Donetsk Another theory is that he was killed in a dispute over control of Donetsk's black market. A source with links to senior separatists told The Telegraph: 'Some suspect that Motorola was killed over an internal fight over control of the black market. 'Others are saying that handlers higher up the chain are cleaning up first-generation rebels to destroy any incriminating evidence and remove witnesses to war crimes. 'The Kremlin needs its proxies to have a more acceptable public face.'   The 33-year-old was purportedly killed by anti-Moscow fighters, but experts and sources close to the warlord have cast doubts on the claims A source close to the warlord voiced doubts over whether Ukrainian forces were behind the killing. 'Motorola was very careful with his security, he was paranoid about his safety and that of his family,' the source said.  It looks like he was eliminated by his cousins in crime of this anti-human terrorist gang. This is a sad but just end. Artyom Shevchenko, Ukrainian Interior Ministry spokesman 'So the idea you could do a sophisticated hit like this requiring such close access requires someone in the inner circle. The official version is pretty doubtful.'  Motorola was described as a 'warrior from God' in Russian newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda after his death, and had previously featured on a set of commemorative stamps in the region.  Footage supposedly taken by Pavlov's killers, who claim to be anti-Moscow rebel factions, shows fighters giving the Nazi salute after a masked figure declares: 'Good day, this video is being recorded in Donetsk, where we have just liquidated the well known terrorist Motorola.' Pools of blood were seen in the road outside Pavlov's apartment block after the bodies of the warlord and his bodyguard were removed The masked killers made threats against Igor Plotnitsky and Alexander Zakharchenko in a video released after Pavlov's death A man in a skeleton-style mask continues, referring to other key pro-Kremlin rebel leaders: 'Zakharchenko, Plotnitsky, you're next.' The threats refer to Igor Plotnitsky, leader of the self-proclaimed Luhansk People's Republic, and Alexander Zakharchenko, prime minister of the Donetsk People's Republic. The authenticity of the footage could not be verified, although pro-Vladimir Putin forces are using it to blame Kiev for the death of the rebel leader, who is hailed as a hero by Russia. 'It looks like he was eliminated by his cousins in crime of this anti-human terrorist gang,' Ukrainian Interior Ministry spokesman Artyom Shevchenko said on social media. 'This is a sad but just end.' Pavlov was already married when he tied the knot with bride Elena Kolenkina in July 2014 The voices speak in Russian, not Ukrainian. Pavlov is known to have departed Donetsk region for Crimea on July 18 2014, the day after MH17 was downed, with new wife Elena Kolenkina, then 21, who he was suspected of marrying in a bigamous ceremony. MH17: INVESTIGATION TEAM HAD FOUND THAT RUSSIAN MISSILE WAS FIRED FROM UKRAINE  The plane crashed in eastern Ukraine in July 2014, killing 298 passengers and crew A report by the Dutch-led Joint Investigation Team (JIT) found that MH17 was shot out of the sky by a Russian missile from a BUK M1 launcher, but it did not name those who it believes carried out the act. The strike was from a location in eastern Ukraine, controlled by pro-Moscow rebels. The launcher had arrived from Russia. And after the strike, it was driven back to Russian territory, according to the JIT. Moscow has strenuously denied the allegations, and accused the investigators of ignoring crucial evidence suggesting the Ukrainian army was to blame for the loss of the MH17.  An earlier attempt on Pavlov's life was made on 24 June. He headed the Sparta battalion in the Ukraine, which was notorious for being one of the most ill-disciplined and ruth  Kiev blamed Pavlov, a former lifeguard and car wash worker, for 'murdering' at least 15 prisoners of war in the bloody Ukrainian conflict. Pro-Kremlin Russian analyst Igor Korotchenko warned: 'In light of recent events, a new round of war in the Donbas, unfortunately, becomes almost inevitable.' Putin supporters in the region blamed Kiev president Petro Poroshenko for Pavlov's death, which they saw as a ceasefire violation. Alexander Zakharchenko, head of Donetsk People's Republic, warned: 'I understand it that Poroshenko has broken the ceasefire and declared war. 'Now you wait. This is enough. We have coped with it enough. We promised enough. My close friend was killed .... It is no ordinary challenge for us.' He warned: 'I'd like to tell the armed forces of Ukraine, national security services and intelligence services: you should be very afraid.' Another source warned: 'Having killed Motorola, Ukraine has declared a start of a terror war.' A spokesman for the neighbouring so-called Lugansk People's Republic - also controlled by pro-Moscow rebels - warned: 'Those involved in this crime will be found and eliminated.' Pavlov was seen as a war hero to Putin but as a criminal to Ukraine, where Poroshenko had been quoted saying last month: 'During questioning, against all international conventions, Ihor (Branovytsky, a Ukrainian prisoner of war) was shot dead personally by one inhuman gangster with the nickname Motorola. Motorola's first Russian wife Victoria Kondrashova, mother of their son Danya, has said she will go to his funeral 'It won't be forgiven. This beast will be made responsible. He will be punished for the death of a Ukrainian hero.' Kiev did not initially officially comment but sources voiced the suspicion that Moscow could be behind his death in order to provoke a new round of war in eastern Ukraine. In one interview Pavlov admitted to allegations that he killed Branovytsky and went on to say: 'I don't give a f*** about what I am accused of, believe it or not. 'I shot 15 prisoners dead. I don't give a f***. No comment. I kill if I want to. I don't if I don't,' he was quoted as saying. He is believed to have been awarded medals by Putin for his role in the Russian military operation to return to Crimean Peninsula to rule by Moscow in defiance of international law. Pavlov suffered serious injuries to his head, arm and leg during fighting in Sloviansk. He was at the centre of the fierce military battle for control on Donetsk airport during the conflict with his Sparta Battalion. There were accusations that his wedding to Elena Kolenkina, now 23, in June 2014 came when he was already married to a wife in Moscow with whom he had a son, then five. Pavlov's bride was seen carrying weapons on her wedding day, and he was described as 'paranoid' about his security Questions have been raised about whether Moscow was behind the warlord's murder, with claims that he knew the identity of those behind the downing of flight MH17 His wife in Moscow, Victoria Kondrashova, confirmed today he was married to her when he died despite his 2014 wedding to Elena. She plans to take their son Danya, now seven, to his father's funeral. Pavlov had told how he met the then 21 year old met in a cellar where she was hiding from shell fire together with her mother. Motorola and his wife Elena were married in Grushevka village in Crimea, at a time when he was already married Motorola's death has been met with threats of violent retaliation It was about two months before their marriage in July 2014, when she reportedly wore a handgun under her bridal gown, and also brandished a Kalashnikov. His death was being treated as a 'terrorist act' likely conducted by Kiev, said head of the rebel parliament in Donetsk, Denis Pushilin. Gevorg Mirzoyan, an expert from the Russian Government Financial University, said: 'Murdering Motorola is not one time shell fire. It is the liquidation of one of the best known field commanders of the DPR. 'And now Kremlin is in a hard position. On the one hand, Russia should not follow Poroshenko's plan to start a war. 'On the other, this murder cannot be left aside either by Donetsk, or by Moscow.' Pavlov was a veteran of fighting in Chechnya, it was reported.  Read more: 'Declaration of war' in Ukraine as pro-Russian rebel commander Arseniy 'Motorola' Pavlov is assassinated in Donetsk lift bombing Share or comment on this article e-mail 65 shares Most watched News videos SNL mocks confident Clinton supporters with Dave Chappelle Havelock resident shocked as he films earthquake hitting NZ Trump supporter spews ignorant racist rant at young woman Adorable boxer dog jumps far better than the John Lewis dog Mother kicks her young child out for voting Trump in school Dashcam footage captures moment van swerves before crashing Michael Moore tries to meet with Trump at Trump Tower Clinton makes final appearance at campaign headquarters Nigel Farage avoids questions as he enters Trump Tower Malcolm Turnbull accuses Lisa Wilkinson of 'interrogating' him SNL mocks government shutdown with Gravity skit Terryfing video of ground shaking as earthquake hits Christchurch Trump says he will 'immediately' deport two to three million...

The budget airline has already broken the mould of transatlantic services by adopting the fuel-efficient long-haul Boeing 787 Dreamliner and running return services from £300 return out of Gatwick. The Boeing 737 Max is a super-efficient longer-range version of the 737, a workhorse of the European short-haul market. Its 4,000-mile range could be used to reach the east coast of the US.

Home Mail Flickr Tumblr News Sports Finance Celebrity Answers Groups Mobile More Yahoo Search Search 0 Mail Tech Home Follow Us Reviews How To Deals Video Games Pogue Apple Exclusive: New Boeing 737 economy seat supplier books initial sales By Alwyn Scott ReutersOctober 18, 2016 Reblog Share Tweet Share The Boeing logo is seen at their headquarters in Chicago, in this April 24, 2013 file photo. REUTERS/Jim Young/File PhotoMore By Alwyn Scott NEW YORK (Reuters) - A new supplier of economy-class seats for Boeing Co's <BA.N> top-selling 737 jetliners has signed its first two airline customers, allowing it to begin production, a person familiar with the matter said on Monday. The agreements with Huntington Beach, California-based LIFT by EnCore, which are due to be announced as early as this week, are the first in which Boeing buys the seats from the supplier, known as "seller-furnished equipment," essentially guaranteeing they will arrive on time. With other seat makers, which include B/E Aerospace <BEAV.O> and Zodiac Aerospace <ZODC.PA>, airlines are required to buy the seats and have them delivered to aircraft factories, a process that has led to problems for the plane makers when seat deliveries are late. European plane maker Airbus <AIR.PA> made a similar move in 2015 when it chose German seat maker Recaro to supply seats for the A320 family. Recaro and LIFT are privately held. LIFT's initial orders will equip at least 50 of Boeing's 737 MAX aircraft with seats designed for the Boeing 737 Sky Interior, with deliveries beginning in 2017, said the source, who could not be named because the negotiations are private. The airline customer names could not be learned. The deals for seats on Boeing's top-selling 737 show initial market acceptance and would allow LIFT to begin certification and production, the source said. Boeing's choice of LIFT as its sole seller-furnished seat supplier prompted drops in B/E Aerospace and Zodiac shares when the deal became public in April. Boeing currently has orders for 4,350 of its 737 jetliners. Boeing declined to comment on LIFT's orders, but said it is seeking new seat suppliers to solve capacity problems that have hampered its assembly lines in the past. "To bring more capacity into the market ... we are looking for and helping to develop more seat companies," Boeing spokeswoman Jessica Kowal said. Boeing shares were up 0.37 percent at $134.00 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Boeing also has been working with Chinese seat maker Ali-Jiatai, which delivered its first set of 737 seats to a Chinese airline over the summer, Kowal said. LIFT by EnCore, founded in 2011, has not delivered seats before. Founders Tom McFarland and Jim Downey sold their previous company, C&D Aerospace, to Zodiac in 2005. EnCore has produced galleys and other aircraft fixtures for customers such as Southwest Airlines.

Beranek in Symphony Hall in Boston in 2003. An expert in acoustics, he improved the sound in several concert venues. Credit Rick Friedman/Corbis, via Getty Images Leo L. Beranek, an engineer whose company designed the acoustics for the United Nations and concert halls at Lincoln Center and Tanglewood, then built the direct precursor to the internet under contract to the Defense Department, died on Oct. 10 at his home in Westwood, Mass. He was 102. His death was confirmed by his son James. Dr. Beranek taught acoustic engineering at Harvard and M.I.T. for more than three decades after World War II, conducting research there that laid the groundwork for acoustic advances with wide social impact, including noise standards for public buildings and airports. But one of his most notable achievements was well outside the field of acoustics. In 1969, the company he helped found, Bolt, Beranek & Newman, won a contract from the Defense Department’s Advanced Research Projects Agency to build the first computer-based network, which came to be called Arpanet. By demonstrating the ability to share data and messages through vast computer networks, Arpanet, a product of government-sponsored research, paved the way for the creation of the internet. Among its many breakthrough achievements, his company sent the first email message that used the @ symbol, in 1972. Continue reading the main story Advertisement Continue reading the main story Dr. Beranek was a sought-after acoustics genius, and Bolt, Beranek & Newman’s first contract was to design the acoustics of the United Nations General Assembly Hall in New York. He also improved the acoustic environment in such landmark concert venues as the Koussevitzky Music Shed at the Tanglewood Music Center in Lenox, Mass., and Philharmonic Hall (now David Geffen Hall) at Lincoln Center in New York. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Dr. Beranek’s most successful book, “Acoustics,” published in 1954, remains a textbook for acoustic engineering students around the world. From 1948 to 1958 he did work on noise control, creating standards that are used internationally today. “I looked into how quiet do spaces have to be to be pleasant for people,” he told an interviewer in 2009. “In other words, can you write a specification saying that if you’re going to have an office, the noise should not be any greater than so much? What are acceptable noise standards in a home, in a factory, in a concert hall? I wrote those.” At the advent of the jet age, Dr. Beranek’s work on noise control became a factor in the controversy over noise levels near the world’s airports when the Boeing 707 jet began flights to Europe from Idlewild (now Kennedy International) Airport in 1958. Despite claims by the airlines and Boeing that jets were no louder than propeller aircraft, Dr. Beranek’s tests showed otherwise, and the airlines were compelled to install mufflers on their jets and make steep climbs during takeoffs to control the noise levels. These standards were adopted around the world. Dr. Beranek was also a founder of a Boston television station, WCVB, and a major donor to arts institutions, including the Boston Symphony Orchestra. Leo Leroy Beranek was born on Sept 14, 1914, in Solon, Iowa. His mother died when he was 11. His father was a farmer and later an owner of a hardware and farm machinery store in Mount Vernon, Iowa. When he was a junior in high school, Dr. Beranek took a correspondence course on radio that sparked a love affair with the medium that lasted for the rest of his life. He opened a radio repair business as a high school senior and became known in Mount Vernon as “the radio man.” His business paid his tuition and living expenses at Cornell College in Mount Vernon, where he enrolled in fall 1931. He graduated with a degree in physics and mathematics in 1936. Advertisement Continue reading the main story During his senior year, a chance encounter outside the Mount Vernon town library changed his life. One afternoon, Dr. Beranek noticed a Cadillac with a flat tire stopped on the street. A middle-aged man emerged from the car, and Dr. Beranek offered to help him change the tire. He chatted with the grateful driver, Glenn Browning, a businessman from Massachusetts, who suggested he apply to Harvard for graduate studies in engineering. Mr. Browning had once taught at Harvard and offered himself as a reference. Dr. Beranek applied and was offered a full scholarship. With a master’s degree in physics and communication engineering from Harvard, he worked with a professor of acoustics, Frederick Hunt, and earned a doctorate in 1940. He became an assistant professor at Harvard that year and held that position until 1946. In 1943 Dr. Bernanek married Phyllis Knight. She died in 1982. He later married Gabriella Sohn, who survives him. Beside his son James, other survivors include another son, Thomas Beranek Haynes; two stepsons, and a granddaughter. During World War II, Dr. Beranek became director of Harvard’s Electroacoustic Lab, where he worked to improve voice communication with airplanes at the request of the military. Until then, voice communication from the ground to airplanes at high altitude was impossible. After the war, Dr. Beranek was recruited to teach at M.I.T., where he was named technical director of the engineering department’s acoustics laboratory. The administrative director of that lab was Richard Bolt, who later founded Bolt, Beranek & Newman with Dr. Beranek and Robert Newman, a former student of Dr. Bolt’s. The company was conceived as a center for leading-edge acoustic research. But Dr. Beranek changed its direction in the 1950s to include a focus on the nascent computer age. “As president, I decided to take B.B.N. into the field of man-machine systems because I felt acoustics was a limited field and no one seemed to be offering consulting services in that area,” Dr. Beranek said in a 2012 interview for this obituary. Advertisement Continue reading the main story He hired J.C.R. Licklider, a pioneering computer scientist from M.I.T., to lead the effort, and it was Dr. Licklider who persuaded him that the company needed to get involved in computers. Under Dr. Licklider, the company developed one of the best software research groups in the country and won many critical projects with the Department of Defense, NASA, the National Institutes of Health and other government agencies. Though Dr. Licklider left in 1962, the company became a favored destination for a new generation of software developers and was often referred to as the third university in Cambridge. “We bought our first digital computer from Digital Equipment Corporation, and with it we were able to attract some of the best minds from M.I.T. and Harvard, and this led to the ARPA contract to build the Arpanet,” Dr. Beranek said. “I never dreamed the internet would come into such widespread use, because the first users of the Arpanet were large mainframe computer owners,” he said. “This all changed when the personal computer became available. With the PC, I could see that computers were fun, and that is the real reason why all innovations come into widespread use.” Daniel E. Slotnik contributed reporting. A version of this article appears in print on October 18, 2016, on page B15 of the New York edition with the headline: Leo L. Beranek, 102, Who Pivoted From Acoustics to Computers, Dies .

Photo: Reuters mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 5:30 AM, October 18, 2016 Updated: 1:50 PM, October 18, 2016 NEW YORK - A new supplier of economy-class seats for Boeing Co's <BA.N> top-selling 737 jetliners has signed its first two airline customers, allowing it to begin production, a person familiar with the matter said on Monday. The agreements with Huntington Beach, California-based LIFT by EnCore, which are due to be announced as early as this week, are the first in which Boeing buys the seats from the supplier, known as "seller-furnished equipment," essentially guaranteeing they will arrive on time. With other seat makers, which include B/E Aerospace <BEAV.O> and Zodiac Aerospace <ZODC.PA>, airlines are required to buy the seats and have them delivered to aircraft factories, a process that has led to problems for the plane makers when seat deliveries are late. European plane maker Airbus <AIR.PA> made a similar move in 2015 when it chose German seat maker Recaro to supply seats for the A320 family. Recaro and LIFT are privately held. LIFT's initial orders will equip at least 50 of Boeing's 737 MAX aircraft with seats designed for the Boeing 737 Sky Interior, with deliveries beginning in 2017, said the source, who could not be named because the negotiations are private. The airline customer names could not be learned. The deals for seats on Boeing's top-selling 737 show initial market acceptance and would allow LIFT to begin certification and production, the source said. Boeing's choice of LIFT as its sole seller-furnished seat supplier prompted drops in B/E Aerospace and Zodiac shares when the deal became public in April. Boeing currently has orders for 4,350 of its 737 jetliners. Boeing declined to comment on LIFT's orders, but said it is seeking new seat suppliers to solve capacity problems that have hampered its assembly lines in the past. "To bring more capacity into the market ... we are looking for and helping to develop more seat companies," Boeing spokeswoman Jessica Kowal said. Boeing shares were up 0.37 percent at $134.00 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Boeing also has been working with Chinese seat maker Ali-Jiatai, which delivered its first set of 737 seats to a Chinese airline over the summer, Kowal said. LIFT by EnCore, founded in 2011, has not delivered seats before. Founders Tom McFarland and Jim Downey sold their previous company, C&D Aerospace, to Zodiac in 2005. EnCore has produced galleys and other aircraft fixtures for customers such as Southwest Airlines.

News United Sees Unit Revenue Improving In Q4 But Labor Pact To Lift Costs United expects consolidated passenger unit revenue to fall 4%-6% in Q4, largely marking an improvement from Q3's 5.8% drop. (Boeing) BILL PETERS 10/17/2016 Reprints United Airlines' (UAL) on Monday said it expects to continue shoring up unit revenue during the fourth quarter, but new labor contracts will also drive up costs. The company expects consolidated passenger unit revenue to fall 4%-6% in Q4, largely marking an improvement from Q3's 5.8% drop and the bigger declines seen in Q2 and Q1. The Q3 unit-revenue decline was partly the result of the strong dollar, weakness in fare-pricing power and "reductions from energy-related corporate travel," the company said. The carrier said it expects flight capacity to grow 1%-2% in Q4 vs. growth of 2% in Q3. United said that consolidated unit costs excluding special charges, third-party business expenses, fuel and profit sharing rose 3.4% during Q3. The increase, the company said, primarily reflected recent labor deals. The company anticipates those unit costs will be up 4.75%-5.75% during Q4. Earnings per share tumbled 31% in Q3 to $3.11, but that was better than the $3.06 analysts expected. Overall revenue fell 4% to $9.91 billion, just above views for $9.90 billion. United's conference call takes place on Tuesday. Shares fell 0.15% in extended trading in the stock market today. Delta Air Lines (DAL), which reported third-quarter results last week, closed down 1.7%. American Airlines (AAL), which reports Thursday, rose 0.3% after dipping 0.2% in regular trading. IBD'S TAKE: In addition to capacity concerns, analysts say the labor deals that airlines have made recently with employees could weigh on profits in the coming year. With oil prices rising, the cheap-fuel tailwind that kept airlines' profits aloft last year is fading. As with other airlines, Wall Street has been looking to see whether United could tighten flight-capacity growth and continue to improve unit revenue. Fare cuts, expansion and the stronger dollar have hurt unit revenue. But Delta has said that rising oil prices in the fourth quarter could prompt the airline industry to pass costs onto travelers — bad news for passengers but better news for the key metric, which measures revenue in relation to capacity.

Most Popular Boom Technology By Jay Bennett Oct 14, 2016 Building a new supersonic airliner has been the elusive dream of aerospace manufacturers ever since the Concorde made its last flight in 2003. But despite four decades of aviation advancements since the Concorde was introduced in 1976, no one else has managed to achieve the supersonic holy grail: New York to London in just 3 or 4 hours. That might finally be changing. Boom Technology, a small aerospace company with funding from Virgin Galactic, is made up of aviation and propulsion experts from the likes of NASA, Pratt & Whitney, Lockheed Martin, Boeing, and Northrop Grumman subsidiary Scaled Composites. The Denver-based team recently redesigned the plans for their Mach 2.2 supersonic airliner, stretching the aircraft to about 155 feet to accommodate 50 passengers rather than 40. They increased the wingspan of the delta-wing slightly as well.

A third engine, embedded in the tail cone section fighter-style, has also been added to the aircraft's design. Boom Technology Most Popular "Moving from a twinjet to a trijet is a better answer," Boom Technology CEO Blake Scholl told Aviation Week. "A twinjet is more challenging to certify for early ETOPS [extended twin operations], while a trijet will enable unrestricted travel on routes with up to 180 minutes diversion time with an engine out." Related Stories NASA to Build a Supersonic Jet Without the Boom Could Boom Be the Next Concorde? NASA Tests Its Quiet-Boom Supersonic Jet Engine Boom is currently working on a one-third-scale prototype of their aircraft, called the XB-1, which will be powered by General Electric CJ610 turbojet engines. Flight of the sub-scale prototype is planned for late 2017 to test the design and aerodynamic structure. The full aircraft, which Boom hopes will enter service by 2023, will be powered by an as-yet unselected engine, modified by Boom with a low-pressure spool so the jet can take off and fly at all stages without afterburner.

"One commercial and one military, the latter with good exportability. ... Making the whole flight profile possible without afterburner is crucial to making it viable." Things appear to be on track for Boom, depending on how their prototype flight testing goes next year. What's more, an independent report provided to Aviation Week by Boyd Group International Strategic Aviation Solutions suggests the market is ready to implement supersonic passenger airliners, with an estimated demand for as many as 1,300 aircraft worth $260 billion across multiple airlines (300 planes more than Boom's in-house estimates). NASA's Quiet Supersonic Technology (QueSST) demonstrator aircraft, an X-plane being developed in partnership with Lockheed Martin to prevent pressure waves from coalescing into a single shockwave as the aircraft breaks the sound barrier, significantly reducing the noise of a sonic boom. NASA/Lockheed Martin The stars might be aligning for Boom, but they still have some hurdles to overcome. Keeping engine noise down on takeoff to adhere to aviation regulations is one of them, and while Scholl said it "can be done with a propulsion system that will make it [noise] compliant for takeoff and be efficient in cruise," he also admitted hitting Mach 2.2 and meeting noise regulations would come with design compromises and "with pain, for sure." Boom isn't alone in its quest for supersonic passenger flight. Aerion plans to launch the certification program for its Mach 1.4 AS2 supersonic trijet by the end of 2017, achieve first flight by 2021, and enter service in 2023. The project is receiving engineering support from aviation giant Airbus. The 12-seat Aerion AS2 supersonic business jet, designed to use natural-laminar-flow over the wings to remain efficient at supersonic speeds. Aerion Corporation NASA is also working to build a new supersonic aircraft, an X-plane called the Quiet Supersonic Technology (QueSST) demonstrator that will be used to test new aerodynamic designs to quiet the noise of a sonic boom. The X-plane will also test new engines capable of supersonic propulsion that are quiet enough to adhere to FAA airport noise regulations. Until the thunder clap of a sonic boom is quieted, companies like Boom can only hope to fly commercial routes over the oceans. But even with only transoceanic routes available to Boom for their first aircraft, airlines are seemingly ready to accept supersonic planes into their fleets. It might not be too much longer until you can take that 3.5-hour flight from JFK to Heathrow, traveling faster than the speed of sound at 60,000 feet, with the curvature of the Earth out your window for a view.

Iran says technical issues are to blame for the delay in receiving the airplanes it has purchased from global aviation giants Airbus and Boeing.  Iran’s Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi said what was previously obstructing the delivery of the planes were the related authorizations by the US Treasury Department which were issued last month.  “The delivery of the planes now depends on the finalization of negotiations between Iran Air from one side and Airbus and Boeing from another,” Araqchi told Iran’s ISNA news agency. He emphasized that negotiations on plane purchases are complicated and comprise many technical and legal issues.  The official added that Iran Air hopes to receive the first planes it has purchased in the near future.  On 21 September, Airbus said it had obtained an initial license from the US Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) for the early delivery of 17 A320 or A330 jets to Iran. This will be part of a deal worth above $10 billion that was signed in January for the delivery of above 100 planes to the Islamic Republic.  The announcement by Airbus was immediately followed by a similar move by Boeing which said OFAC had given the authorization for the company to proceed with a deal it had signed with Iran in June to sell 80 planes to the country.  The company is also expected to lease 29 other planes to the Islamic Republic under the same deal which is estimated to be worth $25 billion.  Officials in Tehran have already announced that Iran needs to purchase between 400 and 500 commercial airliners over the next decade to rejuvenate its ageing aviation fleet.  The country’s current aviation fleet is comprised of around 140 planes with an average age of around 20 years, with many in desperate need of replacement.     Join Albawaba Business Follow Albawaba Business Advertisement Copyright © 2016 Press TV.

MUNICH: European aircraft maker Airbus (AIR.PA) aims to overtake arch rival Boeing (BA.N) in terms of annual plane deliveries by 2020, having fallen behind in recent years, Chief Executive Fabrice Bregier said in a German newspaper interview published on Monday. “In 2020 we will deliver more planes than Boeing again,” Fabrice told the Welt daily newspaper. While Airbus has been leading in terms of new orders for years, its American rival has been ahead since 2012 in terms of deliveries. Bregier said Airbus would particularly focus on its A320 neo narrowbody and A350 widebody planes. He said that Airbus was hopeful it would deliver 50 A350 aircraft this year, although deliveries by the end of September stood at only 26.

The push in the personal transportation sector is strong, with all major manufacturers like Ford, Volkswagen, BMW, Mercedes, and GM (among others) all pushing their own hybrid and electric technology in next-level cars. Eventually, there won’t be a car on the road that has a fuel-powered drivetrain, but what the mass transportation sector? I’m not talking about your municipal public transportation service; no, I’m talking about long-distance travel or, more specifically, airplanes. You can look really hard, but you won’t find any in-service hybrid or electrical planes, but if NASA has its way, all that will change soon enough. How you ask? Well, the U.S. Government’s space agency has recently announced its newest facility – NASA’s Electric Aircraft Testbed (NEAT) – where engineers will design, develop, and test electric aircraft. That’s right! NASA is officially designing and testing all-electric aircraft. Things are still in the early stages, however, so don’t expect to board an all-electric Boeing anytime soon. But, NEAT ran its first test last September in which 600 volts of electricity to test an electric power system that was large enough to power a small, one- or two-person aircraft. “As large airline companies compete to reduce emissions, fuel burn, noise and maintenance costs, it is expected that more of their aircraft systems will shift to using electrical power,” Said Dr. Rodger Dyson – Technical Lead of NASA Glenn Hybrid Gas Propulsion. “What we’re hoping to learn now is how to make it more efficient and light-weight. Next year we’re going to upgrade the size of these motors – we’ll use the same technology to test the higher-power stuff next.” For now, NEAT is just in the beginning stages, but give it time and it will be a “world-class, reconfigurable testbed” that will be able to create and test systems rated at over 20 Megawatts of power – the massive amount of electrical energy it will take to propel a large passenger aircraft like the Boeing 747, for example. Note: The image above shows two engineers conducting the first test of an electric aircraft engine at NEAT Keep reading for the rest of the story. continue reading Source: NASA An Electrified Future is Coming Think about what you just read for a moment. Just 30 years ago, the concept of even electrical cars was dismissed fairly quickly. Fast forward to today, and we have electric cars buzzing around, and gaining momentum in the public eye every day. 30 years from now your children, or maybe even grandchildren, could be traveling across the country in an all-electric airplane that produces zero emissions. On a side note, I can’t help but think about how NEAT could implement solar power into these electric aircraft. Once it gets the point of testing larger, all-electric aircraft, I wouldn’t be surprised if we started seeing large jets layered in solar panels, potentially preventing the need to ever charge the aircraft. That is, of course, assuming we can manage to harness that much energy from the sun. Either way, electric transportation isn’t going away, and NEAT is making the first crucial strides in bringing electrification to aviation. Photo Credit: NASA What is your take?

Yinyi and Impro are major China-based companies employing thousands of people in operations around the world. People close to an ongoing auction of Doncasters, which is being handled by Goldman Sachs, said the Chinese companies' expressions of interest were tentative and may not lead to formal offers. Goldman is in the process of narrowing the field of bidders into a second round, they said. Midlands-based Doncasters, which traces its roots back to 1778, specialises in working with metals and alloys that are difficult to shape, and employs more than 5,000 people. It is expected to fetch well over £1bn from a sale and potentially as much as £1.5bn. If they do proceed with formal offers, the Chinese groups would be pitted against interest from private equity firms including Blackstone, Carlyle and Clayton Dubilier & Rice. One factor mitigating against any possible concern from the UK Government about Chinese ownership is that Doncasters is already in the hands of foreign backers; since 2006, it has been part of the portfolio of Dubai International Capital, a private investment vehicle of the emirate's ruling family which is now being wound down. In the three months since Theresa May entered Downing Street, a number of cross-border deals involving British companies have prompted suggestions from Downing Street that new scrutiny will be applied to foreign takeovers. Last week, it was reported that the Prime Minister wanted to introduce a new vetting system for such transactions in a bid "to get the best deal" for Britain, although no details have emerged about how such a regime would operate. Prospective deals involving Chinese investment into data centre operator Global Switch, Sheffield Forgemasters, a steel supplier to the UK's nuclear submarines, and the Hinkley Point C nuclear power station have sparked opposition from some parts of Whitehall. Doncasters supplies both the civil and military aerospace markets, although there is no suggestion that ministers would seek to block a takeover by a privately-owned Chinese company. In 2014, the British manufacturer made underlying pre-tax profit of about £136m, roughly flat on the previous year. Its accounts for 2015 are expected to be filed at Companies House shortly. A spokeswoman for Doncasters declined to comment.

File N&O photo i LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story Wegmans giveaway I strongly urge our Chapel Hill/Orange County leaders to reconsider their proposed $4 million “giveaway” to Wegmans. They call it an incentive, but it’s clearly a giveaway. There is absolutely no need to lure a luxury grocery chain to a well-known, wealthy, “foodie” town. They’ve done their market research – they already want to come here. And our leaders’ other rationales for the incentives are flawed as well. Why incentivize low-paying, part-time jobs that offer no benefits? Save those dollars for the businesses we really need to attract – ones that offer real living wages and benefits that support a middle-class lifestyle. No new business is going to be created. Don’t we already have more than enough luxury grocery stores? Within an easy drive of the Wegman’s proposed location we have Whole Foods, Southern Season, Fresh Market, and Weaver Street. Even Harris Teeter has upped their game over the years. Existing businesses who have proven to be good citizens of the community will only see their pieces of the upscale food market shrink. If our leaders still think it’s a good idea to spend $4 million of local taxpayer dollars on a grocery store, spend them where it will actually do some good in this town. Use the money they foolishly want to give away to a store that’s probably going to build here anyway to fund incentives that will finally lure a full-service grocery store to the food desert that is downtown and slightly to its north. Jack and Jo Vest Chapel Hill 4 reasons to have voted no I don’t agree with the Town Council decision. 1) Subsidizing Wegmans is not fair to the other five grocery stores (Whole Foods, Trader Joes, Harris Teeter, Food Lion, and Fresh Market) in Chapel Hill. 2) If Chapel Hill leaders are going to subsidize a business, it should be one we don’t already have and one who pays their employees a wage that permits them to actually live in Chapel Hill. 3) Money should go to things we need ... like affordable housing and building a park on the Legion Road property. 4) Wegmans built stores in Cary without subsidies from Cary. Ken Larsen via Facebook For a grocery store? I have long supported bribes, er, incentives because that is how the game is played. A lack of incentives and for many years, an unwillingness to even consider them has meant no automobile plant and no aircraft plant while places like Other Carolina and Alabama plucked corporate gems like BMW, Airbus, Mercedes-Benz, Boeing and others. Those things generate permanent economic multipliers far in excess of the original spending. But $4 million? Or any amount of money. To lure a Wegmans? A grocery store? No, seriously? Dave Thompson via chapelhillnews.com An oasis of fru-fru Can we not? The Chapel Hill-Carrboro area is already overstuffed and catered-to already. We have: ▪ 2 Weaver Street Markets ▪ 4 Harris Teeters ▪ 2 Food Lions ▪ 1 Fresh Market ▪ 1 Trader Joe’s ▪ 1 Whole Foods ▪ 1 Southern Season ▪ 1 Lowe’s Foods ▪ 1 Super Walmart ▪ several ethnic markets ▪ farmer’s markets all week long, and ▪ a Target coming to downtown Franklin in 2017 It’s not an embarrassment of riches. It’s an embarassment. When I first got to town in 2006, I worked at the IFC Men’s Shelter & Community Kitchen as a social worker. To stay physically busy, I worked in the kitchen, as well. The fancy foods we had in that kitchen! Because shelf-space rotation required foods to be moved along to make room for EVEN fresher foods, these places were donating copious amounts of relatively fresh fine foods. Swedish rolls, star fruit, Thai larb mix, on and on and on. If foods could not be prepared for the whole meal, they didn’t work. What happened to them I don’t know and I’m sure good decisions were happening all along. What I am describing was 10 years ago, but the dynamic hasn’t changed. Chapel Hill-Carrboro is the opposite of a food desert; it’s an oasis of fru-fru foods. Don’t get me wrong: I adore unusual foods and I know Wegmans is popular among my friends. In the end, this store makes more sense in Hillsborough where they have only Food Lion and Walmart grocery options, or Chatham County, which is the direction of growth for the western Triangle. Lois Winkler via Facebook Our tax money’s worth? A few weeks ago the Chapel Hill News had an ad from the Chapel Hill-Carrboro City Schools for a New Developments in Education forum. Being new to the community I was taken aback by the fact that you had to pay to attend and that it was an hors d’oeurves and cash bar event at a country club. The topics that were being covered were topics that should be covered in an open town forum where a talk is given and the floor then opened for comments and questions. In fact there should be several forums at schools around the district where all may participate, especially on how tax dollars are allocated and spent. Taxes here are very high and 48 percent of that goes to the schools, yet looking at the state report card for the last two years I do not see outstanding scores. I was a teacher in a school system in Virginia for 20 years with a community very similar in makeup to the community here. Our taxes were lower with similar services you offer here. Our lowest elementary school had end of year (Standards of Learning) test scores of 72 percent. Our high schools had 84 percent in the lowest SOL and up to 96 percent in other SOLs – English, World History, American History, Algebra 1 and 2, Geometry, Biology, Earth Science and Chemistry. I think all in this community needs to take a good look at what is happening in the schools for the amount of taxes being paid. The community has a right to know what is happening in their schools funding-wise, and it should not be a country club, pay-to-come event. Linda Wells Chapel Hill More about the bombings Hans Wuerth’s column “Do we not hear the bombs, see the blood? (CHN, Aug. 31) invites a reaction. Mr. Wuerth’s view of aerial bombings is certainly heartfelt, though short on he facts. Let’s, for insight, consider the Allied bombing campaign of WWII, something he experienced firsthand in Stuttgart, his hometown. Certainly the Allied bombings of German cities were deadly and devastating. But this would not have occurred had Germany not instigated WWII by invading Poland in 1939. (Nor would Hiroshima and Nagasaki have been bombed had the Japanese not bombed Pearl Harbor in 1941.) Yes, thousands were victims in the Allied bombings, but at least 10 times more succumbed in the ground war, including those of the Holocaust and the Germans’ use of slave labor. Another point to be made is that the Gerham fuehrer did not favor the bombing of Allied cities, thus the German Luftwaffe had no large, long-range bombers necessary for a strategic campaign. Hitler’s war strategy was to invade, conquer and occupay. And once he conquered he did not desire detsroyed cities. What about the Blitz of London and other British cities? The Blitz, which cost the Germans in airmen and aircraft more than they gained, was simply Hitler’s being piqued at being thwarted by the British RAF Fighter Command in his plan to invade, conquer and enslave the British people. And to eliminate a powerful enemy on his western flank as he intended to invade the Soviets in the east. An enraged dictator can produce a foolish decision! Finaly, Mr. Wuerth might well realize his hope that aircraft cease being bombers and relegated to transportng people. Ballistic rockets, perfected by Dr. Wernher von Braun for his fuehrer, are much cheaper to produce and more deadly as no defense has yet to be perfected. Aa for the situation in Iraq and Syria, my sense is that absent aircraft bombings the savagery would continue, perhaps even increase.

By Richard Tomkins   |   Oct. 18, 2016 at 7:53 AM Follow @upi Comments Sign up for our Security newsletter CANBERRA, Australia, Oct. 17 (UPI) -- Boeing Australia is to provide sustainment support for P-8A Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft flown by the Royal Australian Air Force. Australia's Department of Defense said that under a contract with the company the services will occur over the next four years. The government was quoted as saying the contract will result in local jobs. "Developing this kind of indigenous capability -- where we can maintain our own military hardware -- is critical for our national security and is good for Australian jobs," said Defense Industry Minister Christopher Pyne. "The P-8A is a world-class maritime patrol and response aircraft and Australian Defense industry support will be a critical enabler to our military's operational capability in the region." The P-8A from Boeing is used for anti-submarine warfare, anti-surface warfare, shipping interdiction and electronic signals intelligence missions. It has a maximum speed of more than 500 miles per hour and a combat radius of 1,200 nautical miles.

Feared pro-Putin warlord who revelled in killing POWs ‘was killed because he knew dark secrets about who downed doomed flight MH17’ Arseniy Pavlov was given war medals by Putin himself over actions in Crimea and eastern Ukraine By DANNY COLLINS and WILL STEWART 18th October 2016, 10:53 am Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window) Comments A PRO-Russian warlord could have been killed in the Ukraine on orders from Moscow because he knew too much about the MH17 crash, it has been claimed. Several influential figures in the Ukraine believe pro-Russian mercenary Arseniy Pavlov, 33, was handed a death sentence because he knew who shot down the jet. WILL STEWART 12 Arseniy Pavlov, pictured here on his wedding day, was killed by Moscow because he knew too much about the MH17 crash, it has been claimed WILL STEWART 12 The pro-Russian Ukraine separatist was blown up alongside his bodyguard in a lift at his home WILL STEWART 12 The 33-year-old had spent the past years fighting against Ukraine forces in both Crimea and eastern Ukraine Russian troops storm Ukrainian bases in Crimea The Kuala Lumpur-bound Malaysia Airlines jet was blasted out of the sky in July 2014 killing all 298 on board. And Russian journalist Yulia Latynina believes Pavlov's death warrant was signed at the very highest level because he knew who shot down the doomed liner. He was "the one who knew who hit the Boeing", she said. related stories CRASH FACTS When was the MH17 plane crash, how many people died and has Malaysia Airlines recovered? VLAD IN THE DOCK Missile that downed MH17 over Ukraine DID come from Russia, damning probe reveals HORROR ON FLIGHT MH17 Chilling animation reveals how doomed MH17 was downed by missile TERROR ARREST First pictures of Brit charged with two terrorism offences linked to the conflict in eastern Ukraine PUTIN THE BOOT IN Satellite images show Russian missile launcher hours before MH17 was shot down Moscow may want "more acceptable civilian faces not directly implicated in MH17 or war crimes", added Alex Kokcharov, a Ukraine and Russia risk expert. But Russia insists a pro-Ukrainian death squad killed Pavlov – nicknamed Motorola - after footage emerged of them giving the Nazi salute on camera following his death. And experts fear the murder could see Russian rebels and the Ukraine return to war before long. Pavlov and his bodyguard died in a bomb attack on a lift in his Donetsk apartment block, the latest of several attempts to assassinate him. WILL STEWART 12 And it is alleged during that time he came to know who shot down the Malaysia Airlines jet, leading to orders that he should be killed WILL STEWART 12 However, a Ukrainian group has claimed responsibility for the death in a video during which they perform a Nazi salute WILL STEWART 12 Pavlov was "the one who knew who hit the Boeing", a prominent journalist has said Blood stains were seen on the road outside after the men were removed from the lift. Footage supposedly from anti-Moscow rebel factions shows a group of fighters giving the Nazi salute after a masked figure declares: "Good day, this video is being recorded in Donetsk, where we have just liquidated the well-known terrorist Motorola." A man in a skeleton mask and speaking Russian and referring to other key pro-Kremlin rebel leaders, adds: "Zakharchenko, Plotnitsky, you're next." The authenticity of the footage could not be verified, but pro-Vladimir Putin forces are using it to blame Kiev for the death of the rebel leader, who is hailed as a hero by Russia. The warlord is known to have left the Donetsk region for Crimea on the 18 July, the day after the MH17's downing. A Dutch-led Joint Investigation Team (JIT) found the plane was shot out of the sky by a Russian missile from a BUK M1 launcher, but it did not name those who it believes carried out the act. WILL STEWART 12 The warlord is also accused of carrying out summary executions of prisoners of war WILL STEWART 12 He is even believed to have received medals from Russian President Vladimir Putin over his actions against the Ukraine WILL STEWART 12 In another bizarre revelation it was claimed he married Elena Kolenkina (pictured) when he was already married to a wife in Moscow with whom he had a five-year-old son Russian denial on rocket which took down Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 The strike was from a location in eastern Ukraine, controlled by pro-Moscow rebels. The launcher had arrived from Russia.  And after the strike, it was driven back to Russian territory, according to the report. Moscow has strongly denied the allegations, and accused investigators of ignoring crucial evidence suggesting the Ukrainian army was to blame for the loss of the MH17. Pavlov’s actions during the conflict are thought to have earned him hundreds of enemies. He had boasted of executing several prisoners of war, saying: “ I shot 15 prisoners dead. I don't give a f***. No comment. I kill if I want to. I don't if I don't.” An earlier attempt on his life was made on 24 June. He is believed to have been awarded medals by Putin for his role in the military operation to return Crimea to Russian rule in defiance of international law. WILL STEWART 12 Experts on the Russia-Ukraine conflict have warned that his death could lead to a resumption of hostilities Reuters 12 MH17 was brought down over eastern Ukraine, killing all on board. An investigation ruled it had been taken down by pro-Russian rebels Universal News And Sport (Europe) 12 An investigation ruled that it was shot down by a BUK rocket launched (circled) that had been brought across the border from Russia Final moments of MH17 And fears are rising that Motorola's slaying could spark a new cycle of bloody violence in a region known as Donbass and even lead to a resumption of hostilities. Pro-Kremlin Russian analyst Igor Korotchenko warned: "In light of recent events, a new round of war in the Donbas, unfortunately, becomes almost inevitable." The Chechnya-conflict veteran continues to create problems in death, as it emerged this week that he was married TWICE. There were accusations that his wedding to Elena Kolenkina, 23, in June 2014, came when he was already married to a wife in Moscow with whom he had a five-year-old son. His wife in the Russian capital, Victoria Kondrashova, confirmed today he was married to her when he died. We pay for your stories! Do you have a story for The Sun Online news team?

On Sept. 9, the two-year-old Incarcerated Workers Organizing Committee (IWOC) announced a nationally coordinated work stoppage and protest across American prisons. Organizers say there have been strikes at 29 prisons in 12 states — Virginia, Ohio, California, Florida, Alabama, South Carolina, Michigan, and more. "There are probably 20,000 prisoners on strike right now, at least, which is the biggest prison strike in history, but the information is really sketchy and spotty," the IWOC's Ben Turk told The Intercept last month. This new round of protests was meant to commemorate the 1971 takeover of Attica prison, which was brutally put down by the New York state government and its troopers. Just as the uprising of Attica's prisoners was in protest of abuse, racism, and abysmal prison conditions, the new wave of prison strikes has its own grievances: Mass incarceration, three-strikes laws, abusive and dismal conditions — but above all, prison labor. By some estimates, the prison labor economy brings in $2 billion annually, and employs 900,000 people or more. The labor is often used by state governments to offset costs in their own budgets, and many companies — including IBM, Boeing, Microsoft, AT&T, and Macy's — either currently make use of prison labor or have in the past. At Perry Correctional Institution in South Carolina, for example, where The New Yorker spoke with a striking inmate, the work can range from furniture manufacturing to kitchen duties, landscaping, and janitorial jobs. Across the nation, inmates make clothes, laundry supplies, name plates, park equipment, and food equipment, renovate buses, repair tires, and more. Supporters of prison labor argue that these work programs give inmates structure and a sense of meaning and purpose — along with increasing their chances of finding employment when they're released. And indeed, there's some research to back up those claims. The problem, critics say, is that inmates are required to work. They don't have a choice in the matter, and they're often punished (sometimes with solitary confinement) for refusing to work. Prisoners have essentially no way to argue for better compensation or better working conditions. And while inmates are ostensibly supposed to be paid prevailing wages, reality often falls far short of that. Fees, taxes, and deductions eat into inmates wages: everything from deductions for victims' compensation or restitution funds, child support, co-pays for medical treatment, or even to cover the overhead costs of the very work-release programs that give inmates the jobs in the first place. Actual pay at federal prisons runs from 12 to 40 cents an hour, and at state prison systems, sometimes the inmates are paid nothing. It would cost prison systems hundreds of millions more each year to pay all their inmates minimum wage. Hence the enormous incentive to get by on paying the inmates a pittance. But it's also the strikers' source of leverage: At this point, the prison systems can't operate without their (nearly free) labor. Almost two-thirds of the prisoners who work under these conditions are not white, versus just 30 percent of the American population as a whole that's non-white. The IWOC has clearly connected the dots between modern prison labor and America's shameful past use of slavery: "Overseers watch over our every move, and if we do not perform our appointed tasks to their liking, we are punished," the union's announcement read. "They may have replaced the whip with pepper spray, but many of the other torments remain: isolation, restraint positions, stripping off our clothes, and investigating our bodies as though we are animals." Getting solid information on the scale and nature of the strikes is difficult, since prison officials can maintain pretty tight control over the information that gets out of their facilities. The Department of Corrections, not surprisingly, has denied that any work stoppages are occurring. Inmates themselves, along with their families and the IWOC, had to coordinate their activities via mail, stealth conference calls, lawyers and advocates, social media, online forums, and the occasional smuggled cell phone. Prison strikes have a mixed record of success, and this round may already be winding down. If they don't break through now, organizers hope to boycott the outside world — namely, the companies that rely on prison labor. It's sort of the point of the American incarceration system to consign people to oblivion; to remove them from our shared social life as punishment for their crimes. But that's also what makes it so hard to show the outside world — or get it to care — when prisoners are the ones being victimized. Try 4 Risk-Free Issues of The Week magazine.

Also, if the operation to free Mosul (with a population of over 500,000 from the Islamic State) turns out to be a success, it will destroy terrorists’ base in Iraq, but it may lead to a new wave of refugees. Read also Russia urges France, US to be careful about actions in Iraq’s Mosul Alexander Shumilin, Director of the Center for Middle East Conflict Analysts at the Institute of the US and Canadian Studies told RBC newspaper that "the capture of Mosul will seriously diminish IS’ presence in Iraq and may become a watershed moment in the anti-terror campaign. According to Vladimir Sotnikov, a senior researcher with the Institute of Oriental Studies of the Russian Academy of Sciences, and director of the Russia - East - West Strategic Research and Analysis Center, "the operation is unique and has been prepared by all sides for a long time." "If the Iraqi forces get closer to the city and street clashes begin, the chances for success will increase," he stressed. However, Boris Dolgov, an expert at the Institute of Oriental Studies of the Russian Academy of Sciences, is more skeptical about the outcome of the operation. Dolgov explained to Nezavisimaya Gazeta that even if the city is retaken IS (terrorist organization banned in Russia) would not be utterly defeated, whereas Mosul would remain an important territory for the insurgents. He noted that financial support for IS goes through Mosul. Terrorists had also seized the Iraqi army’s military warehouses there. "If street fighting starts in Mosul the operation will linger on, and in this case aviation and heavy armor should not be used," Dolgov said, adding that "militants are likely to use civilians as human shields."   Izvestia: Russia and China to carry out joint military exercises regularly Concerns about the US global ballistic missile defense (BMD) system on the Korean Peninsula has pushed Moscow and Beijing a step closer to decide on launching joint military drills, which would include anti-missile exercises, on a perpetual basis, Izvestia writes on Tuesday. A source in the Chinese Foreign Affairs Ministry told the newspaper that the decision to carry out anti-missile exercises on a regular basis was made after the two countries had their first successful computer-assisted command-staff exercise on anti-missile defense in May 2016. The Russian and Chinese foreign ministries say the exercises are not aimed at any third country. However, the Beijing source told the newspaper that the danger of tensions escalating looms on the Korean Peninsula, with Washington being the primary threat.

In September, a joint exercise was carried out in the South China Sea by Russia and China, which will be continued further on in order to maintain military cooperation between Moscow and Beijing, Congyou told Izvestia. He added that "if certain countries assume this kind of cooperation between Moscow and Beijing is directed against them, this only means that they themselves have malicious intentions." Speaking about the agreement between the United States and South Korea on the THAAD anti-missile complex on the Korean Peninsula for potential protection from the North Korean threat, Gui Congyou said that both Russia and China are concerned that the system would not facilitate de-escalation of tensions in the area and undermine their security. "Regarding the issue of the US’ BMDs in Europe and the Asian-Pacific region, I can say that China and Russia have similar positions that this sort of action by the United States only shatters the strategic stability in the world and deepen tensions. We’re absolutely against it," he said.   Izvestia: More anti-Russia sanctions may bring down Europe’s aircraft industry Another round of sanctions against Russia to be considered at the upcoming EU summit in Brussels on October 20-21, possibly affecting some areas of military-industrial complex and aircraft manufacturing, will hurt European aircraft makers themselves. According to a source in one of Russia’s defense corporations speaking with Izvestia daily, European airline manufacturers cannot operate without Russia’s titanium supplies.

Moreover, they are used for constructing Boeing-787s, Dreamliner, Boeing-747-8s, Airbus A-350s and A-380s. "The Russian company cooperates with both Boeing and Airbus, and all titanium parts in their airplanes are of Russian origin," the source added. So far, Moscow is not considering reciprocal measures since it does not see economic sanctions as an efficient instrument of ironing out differences, Deputy Chairman of the State Duma’s (lower house of parliament) International Affairs Committee Aleksey Chepa told Izvestia. "All sanctions imposed against any country are counterproductive. I do not think that a new package of sanctions will affect aircraft manufacturing or the military-industrial complex, as western countries purchase both titanium and aluminum from Russia. I’m confident that the companies that have been cooperating with us for many years, will continue doing so as sanctions batter not only our economy but western companies and the EU’s economy as well," he explained.   Komsomolskaya Pravda: Truck toll system gaining traction The Platon system of charging fees for trucks and other long-haul vehicles is now yielding results despite the uproar against it earlier this year, Russia’s Special Presidential Envoy for Environmental Activity, Ecology and Transport Sergey Ivanov said in an interview with Komsomolskaya Pravda newspaper. According to the official, people now acknowledge its necessity. The truck toll scheme known as Platon is a system of fees for heavy trucks weighing in excess of 12 tonnes for using the federal roads has been in effect since November 15, 2015. The plan is to raise the rate in the future from the initial 1.53 rubles (roughly 4 US cents) per kilometer. The money is to be earmarked for road repairs.

Now that the funds are there and are being spent on construction of bridges and junctions, they say, "yes, it looks fine," he said. Also, the official criticized manufacturers for not properly using the existing road network. "Until recently there was no fee for using roads for consumers. As a result, we had a situation when manufacturers transported coal and metals on small distances - of 500 kilometers - on long-haul vehicles instead of using railroads. What will the condition of the roads be, if we are going to have 60-tonne trucks on them," he told the newspaper. According to Ivanov, high-quality highways are being constructed in Russia now, though most of them are federal highways, which have required trillions of rubles of investment over the past years. "However, the regional and municipal road network is a mess. Of course, they lack funds," he said, adding that he does not expect sufficient funds to be invested to provide "a totally free of charge road network" any time soon. Ivanov added that he sees no future for Russia without the development of the country’s transport infrastructure.   Gallery 10 photo © AP Photo/Sony Pictures Classics, Anna Matveeva Russian Academy Award winners and nominees RBC: Netflix buys Russian TV series for the first time The Sreda Production company, founded by producer Alexander Tsekalo, has sold the rights to its TV series ‘Silver Spoon’ in what has become the first transaction between the global streaming service and a Russian film producer on worldwide, readymade video on demand basis, RBC business daily writes. The series will be available on Netflix in autumn 2016, the newspaper says. Alexander Tsekalo told RBC that "the series had been sold at the international market price." "The deal makes me proud of the results of my own work and encourages to produce high-quality series," he added. Also, he said, the talks on potential purchases of some other series produced by Sreda, are currently underway.   TASS is not responsible for the material quoted in the press reviews {{item.group_date}} {{item.suffix?", "+item.suffix:""}} Show more Share Top News November 14, 8:26 Russian military to perform observation flight over US November 14, 8:26 November 14, 9:01 Czech PM calls initiatives to deploy US radar in republic 'pure fiction' November 14, 9:01 November 13, 16:17 Foreign ministry’s spokeswoman translates Stoltenberg into "comprehensible" language November 13, 16:17 November 14, 8:30 Socialist leader wins presidential election in Moldova November 14, 8:30 In other media Реклама Photo 9 Results of Vladimir Putin's visit to Serbia 11 38th mission to the International Space Station over, cosmonauts back to earth 11 First woman in space Infographics Russia's gas pipelines to Europe by 2018 Russia’s state defense order in 2015 Chinese Lunar Exploration Program Russia’s Angara A5 heavy-load space carrier rocket Most read Now Today This week 1 Russian military to perform observation flight over US 2 MP: Protests against poll results in Moldova depend on political culture of lost parties 3 Diplomat: Withdrawal of Russian troops from Transnistria is 'Ukraine’s provocation' 4 Russian energy minister sees risks for gas transit through Ukraine in winter 5 Igor Dodon standing for closer relations with Russia leading Moldovan presidential polls 6 Socialist leader wins presidential election in Moldova 7 Czech PM calls initiatives to deploy US radar in republic 'pure fiction' 1 Foreign ministry’s spokeswoman translates Stoltenberg into "comprehensible" language 2 Erdogan says protests in US only temporary 3 Crimea to supply gas to Ukraine’s town till March - legislator 4 Karjakin-Carlsen Game 2 ends in draw 5 International military drills 'Slavic Brotherhood' closed near Belgrade 6 Putin reiterates Russian Armed Forces not threatening anybody 7 Russia to attend talks with OPEC on November 26-28 - Novak 1 Dutch sub tried to approach Russian aircraft carrier in Mediterranean — defense ministry 2 Trump elected president of the United States — live coverage 3 Source: 16 US servicemen killed, 27 injured in fighting for Iraq’s Mosul 4 Putin congratulates Donald Trump on winning US presidential election 5 Russia-US discord will leave with Obama administration: lawmakers' reaction to Trump's win 6 US election results in animated graphics 7 Foreign ministry’s spokeswoman translates Stoltenberg into "comprehensible" language TOP STORIES US presidential election 2016 Conflict in Syria Russia's defense industry Oil & Gas Industry Space programs Реклама News World Russian Politics & Diplomacy Business & Economy Military & Defense Science & Space Society & Culture Sport Press Review Sections Tags Media Press Releases Infographics About us TASS TODAY AGENCY NEWS TASS HISTORY MANAGEMENT CONTACTS Services TASS-PHOTO TASS-ONLINE TASS Beta-version.

Rough Cut (no reporter narration). ▲ Hide Transcript ▶ View Transcript (ROUGH CUT ONLY - NO REPORTER NARRATION) Japan News Network (JNN), a network of local broadcasters, put out dramatic footage on Wednesday (January 16) of passengers being evacuated from the ANA 787 Dreamliner which was forced to make an emergency landing at an airport in western Japan, following a malfunction in the plane's batteries. Japan's two leading airlines grounded their fleets of Boeing 787s on Wednesday following the incident which triggered renewed, global safety concerns over a plane many see as the future of commercial aviation. ANA flight 692 left Yamaguchi Airport in western Japan shortly after 8 a.m. local time (2300 GMT Tuesday) bound for Haneda Airport near Tokyo, a 65-minute flight. About 18 minutes into the flight, at 30,000 feet, the plane began a descent. It descended to 20,000 feet in about four minutes and made an emergency landing 16 minutes later, according to flight-tracking website Flightaware.com. A spokesman for Osaka airport authority said the plane landed in Takamatsu at 8:45 a.m. All 129 passengers and eight crew were evacuated safely via the plane's inflatable chutes. Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said 5 people were slightly injured when they jumped out using the emergency chutes. All Nippon Airways Co said it was grounding all 17 of its 787s and Japan Airlines Co said it suspended all 787 flights scheduled for Wednesday. ANA said its planes could be back in the air as soon as Thursday (January 17) once checks were completed. The two carriers operate around half of the 50 Dreamliners delivered by Boeing to date. Wednesday's incident follows a series of mishaps for the new Dreamliner. The sophisticated plane, the world's first mainly carbon-composite airliner, has suffered fuel leaks, a battery fire, wiring problem, brake computer glitch and cracked cockpit window in recent days.

Bizarre spot for a nice cold beer travel advice flights Why plane windows don’t always match the seats next to them October 18, 20168:49pm What’s the point of having a window when it’s nowhere near you? Lauren McMahnews.com.au@lauren_mcmah  Share Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Google+ Share on Reddit Email a friend FOR air passengers who love to gaze out at wide blue yonder, few things are more frustrating than finding your carefully selected window seat and realising there’s no window next to it. It seems that in every few rows on a commercial jet, the windows don’t quite line up with the seats, rendering the window pretty much useless. So what’s the deal with this annoying design oddity? The team behind YouTube channel Today I Found Out has dug into the issue and shared the fairly rational explanation. And it is this: while aircraft manufacturers decide where the windows go, it’s up to the airlines to decide where the seats go — and neither decision is necessarily made with the other in mind. Manufacturers such as Boeing and Airbus arrange where windows will be located in the cabin, with some thought as to where seats should go, and will pass on their seating recommendation to the airlines. The arrangement of rows and seats on the plane is totally up to the airline.Source:ThinkStock But airlines usually disregard those recommendations in favour of their own seating plans, usually so they can squeeze more and more rows of seats into the aircraft and decrease the seat pitch, or legroom, in order to raise more revenue and keep fares competitive. Tracks on the floor of aircraft cabins allow rows of seats to be pushed closer together or further apart at the airline’s discretion. It is also up to the airline to decide what seating configuration is used, such as a 3-4-3 arrangement, a 2-3-2, or the universally dreaded 3-5-3. So the reason windows don’t always match up with the seats is usually because the airline has crammed an extra couple of rows onto the plane, probably to make more money, and thrown the perfect alignment of seats and windows out of whack.

Manufacturing output was up a little faster, but a major drop in aerospace restrained activity. Boeing still has a huge backlog, so that is not likely to continue. Advertisement More worrisome was continued weakness in machinery. That may indicate uncertainty on the part of businesses about the future direction of the economy and an unwillingness to make any major bets. Overall activity was restrained by declining utility production. It’s tough to seasonally adjust for the weather when there is climate change. (No, I don’t think it is a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese.) But the most optimistic number in the report was the robust gain in petroleum production. Output is now actually up over the year. While there may be some hints at conditions improving in the Industrial Production release, conditions in the New York Fed’s regional manufacturing sector faltered further. Orders are still declining, but less so. However, optimism about the future is improving. This part of the country is not a hot bed of industrial activity, but a decline there is another indication that manufacturing has a way to go before it can start adding greatly to the economy. MARKETS AND FED POLICY IMPLICATIONS: >> While manufacturing has been soft, that doesn’t mean the domestic economy is falling apart. Remember, we are in a global economy and world growth and the value of the dollar matter. Those factors have been working against the sector. In addition, the collapse of the oil complex has hurt firms that provide goods, much of them manufactured, to the energy companies. But as Nobel Laureate Bob Dylan wrote: The times, they are a changin’. Energy prices are no longer sinking like a stone and firms are starting to swim again (apologies to those who know the lyrics). Indeed, rig counts are rising consistently and are up sharply from the bottom reached in the spring. We might even see some investment in the industry in 2017. That would be a great turnaround that could help the manufacturing sector. But that remains a hope, not a reality. For the markets, though, Monday’s reports probably will not have much of an impact. We are in earnings season. But for the Fed, which produces the industrial production data, the recent data provide a little for everyone. The production rise was modest enough so those that want to wait can say economic conditions are still not great. Meanwhile, those who want to hike rates can say the worst looks to be over, especially with the dollar off its highs and reasonably stable. Which means, we are still nowhere when it comes to having data that demands a Fed rate hike. Of course, that is only a concern to those who actually think the Fed is data driven. Joel L.

The KC-135 Stratotanker’s 60 years of service were recognized during a ceremony at Dock 5 ½ in Bldg. 3001. The KC-135’s actual anniversary coincides with the first flight on Aug. 31, 1956, so the fall celebration at the home of all organic depot workload was perfectly suited. Guest speakers from the Air Force Sustainment Center, Air Force Life Cycle Management Center, Rockwell Collins and Boeing credited the longevity of the KC-135 fleet in large part to the skilled workforce at Tinker Air Force Base, which was instrumental in putting a record 75 KC-135 aircraft through programmed depot maintenance in fiscal 2016. Col. Mark Mocio, Legacy Tanker Division commander and program manager for the KC-135 was one of the featured guest speakers at the KC-135 60th Anniversary event Oct. 7 and spoke on the legacy of the Stratotanker. The other distinguished visitor guest speakers included Air Force Sustainment Center Commander Lt. Gen. Lee Levy II; Donald Thompson, deputy program executive officer for Tanker with the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center; Ryan Roseke, with Rockwell-Collins; and Pam Valdez, with Boeing. (Air Force photo by Kelly White) “As we celebrate the birthday of a national treasure today, we do so realizing that the 60 years of success of the KC-135 is due to generations that preceded us, this generation and the generations to come that have invested their lives in the tanker fleet — contractor, civilian and military personnel,” said Col. Mark Mocio, Legacy Tanker Division commander and program manager for the KC-135. “Because of your efforts, the KC-135 has served as the backbone of military aerial refueling for 60 years and will continue for decades to come.” The Legacy Tanker program office at Tinker is responsible for life cycle management of the KC-135 fleet, while the maintenance, repair and overhaul is performed by the Oklahoma City Air Logistics Complex, including the 76th Aircraft Maintenance Group. They have separate organizational chains and separate responsibilities, but the two groups work together to provide combat power to the Airmen. Cooperation is the key to getting the job done, Colonel Mocio said. Col. Kenyon Bell, 76th AMXG commander, agrees. “Our strength really lies in our people,” he said. “We can’t do anything without our talented and dedicated workforce. Our collective team is laser focused daily on providing safe, quality aircraft back to the operational forces.” Donald Thompson, deputy program executive officer for Tankers with the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, said those flying the first KC-135 in 1956 probably never imagined that the same aircraft would be flying 60 years later, much less continue until the 2040’s. “None of that would be possible without you, the men and women of the Air Force and those working for our mission partners,” he said. “For 60 years you have been the unsung heroes on the KC-135.” Members of Team Tinker gathered together Oct. 7 to celebrate the KC-135 Stratotanker’s 60 years of service. (Air Force photo by Kelly White) Addressing the maintainers in attendance, Mr. Thompson urged them to never forget the importance of their role. “Each of the KC-135 crew members and passengers put their lives in your hands every day,” he said. “You see, each of you is just as critical to the KC-135 mission execution chain as the pilot and boom operator. Without you, they will never offload another gallon of gas, they will never save another life and they will never transport another short ton. Thank you for taking this responsibility so seriously and thank you, Tanker family, for all you do.” Air Force Sustainment Center Commander Lt. Gen. Lee K. Levy II said there are many more chapters to be written in the history of the KC-135 and he’s looking forward to seeing what the next chapter will be. The KC-135 60th Anniversary brought a huge crowd to the programmed depot maintenance line in Bldg. 3001 Oct. 7. The event featured guest speakers from the Air Force Sustainment Center, Rockwell-Collins, Boeing and the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center. (Air Force photo by Kelly White) “I don’t know what it will say, but I can tell you it will be impressive,” the general said. “I know it will help the United States Air Force, the world’s most respected and powerful aerospace and cyber force, remain on top in its preeminent role. And whatever it is that the KC-135 is called on to do next, it will be because of everyone in this room and everybody that you represent. It’s an amazing legacy.”   2:34 pm Mon, October 17, 2016 The Tinker Take Off jilliancoleman Related Articles PHOTO: Energy aware November 7, 2016 AF takes initial steps to reduce training unrelated to primary missions November 7, 2016 The importance of Veterans Day November 7, 2016 My Account SUBSCRIBE MANAGE ACCOUNT PRIVACY POLICY SUBSCRIBER AGREEMENT Recent Posts PHOTO: Energy aware AF takes initial steps to reduce training unrelated to primary missions The importance of Veterans Day 552nd ACW awarded Meritorious Unit Award Journal Record ABOUT CONTACT US FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS DOLAN BUSINESS BOOKS LAWYERS WEEKLY BOOKS Copyright © 2016 Tinker Take Off 101 N.

(AP) — One of NASA’s main delivery companies made a triumphant comeback seen up and down the East Coast Monday night, launching its first space station shipment from Virginia since a rocket explosion two years ago. The Orbital ATK Antares rocket lifts off from the the NASA Wallops Island flight facility in Wallops Island, Va., Monday, Oct. 17, 2016. The rocket is carrying supplies to the International Space Station. (AP Photo/Steve Helber) It was the first flight of Orbital ATK’s unmanned Antares rocket since the Oct. 28, 2014, blast that wrecked the pad and destroyed everything on the space station supply run. The launch provided a show for sky gazers along much of the East Coast. Reports poured in via Twitter from observers in Washington, Baltimore, Philadelphia, New York, and even Raleigh, North Carolina. For Antares’ long-awaited return, the pad underwent a $15 million restoration, and the rocket got new Russian engines to replace the vintage ones from a half-century earlier. As the Antares streaked through the night sky from NASA’s Wallops Flight Facility, it appeared as though all the work had paid off. Launch controllers applauded when the supply ship reached orbit and victory was declared. WATCH: An Orbital ATK rocket was launched from NASA’s Wallops Island Flight Facility at 7:45 p.m. Monday. See the full launch in the video above. WAVY App Users: Click here to watch. NASA Administrator Charles Bolden described the launch as “magnificent” and personally thanked the Orbital ATK team. “It’s been a very difficult two years, and I can’t imagine what those of you in the Orbital team went through. I can’t imagine how long you were holding your breath tonight,” Bolden told the launch control crowd. “But you know, we made it and that’s what’s all important.” Lift off! @OrbitalATK's #Antares rocket launches to deliver science & supplies to @Space_Station. Keep watching: https://t.co/KX5g7zfYQe pic.twitter.com/OIbREmBJg1 — NASA (@NASA) October 17, 2016 Getting a lift from the Antares was Orbital ATK’s Cygnus capsule, loaded with more than 5,000 pounds of food, equipment and research, including some experiments to study flames in space and the robotic toy ball Sphero, part of an educational effort. The Cygnus — named after the swan constellation — will have to hang around in orbit until Sunday before delivering the goods. That’s because three astronauts are awaiting launch from Kazakhstan on Wednesday, which would get them to the space station on Friday. NASA wants the new crew to settle in before the Cygnus pulls up. PHOTOS: NASA releases new images of Antares launch explosion This will be the sixth Cygnus to arrive at the orbiting outpost since 2013. While the Antares was being redesigned, Orbital ATK made good on two deliveries using another company’s rockets flying from Cape Canaveral. NASA’s other commercial shipper, SpaceX, has made nine station deliveries since 2012, but is currently grounded, pending an investigation into last month’s rocket explosion during prelaunch testing at Cape Canaveral. Given the riskiness of space flight, Orbital ATK officials expressed nervousness before the launch, but said they had full confidence in the rocket. Photos: Anteres rocket launches from Wallops NASA has been relying on Orbital ATK and SpaceX to keep the space station stocked ever since the shuttles retired in 2011. Next up will be private flights for the station crews, as the space agency works on getting astronauts to Mars in the 2030s. SpaceX and Boeing are building capsules to carry U.S. astronauts to the 250-mile-high station; those launches are expected in the next couple of years. Until then, NASA will keep flying its astronauts on Russia’s Soyuz spacecraft. The space station is currently home to an American, a Russian and a third astronaut from Japan. They will be joined by an American and two Russians. Orbital ATK weathered brief hurricane delays over the past 1½ weeks, then a bad cable at the pad on Sunday bumped the launch by a day.

Last quarter, the company posted a positive earnings surprise of 18.97%. Over the past four quarters, the company has posted an average positive earnings surprise of 11.49%. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement. Factors at Play for Microsoft  Microsoft reported better-than-expected fiscal fourth-quarter results with both the top and the bottom lines exceeding the Zacks Consensus Estimate. While increased investment in the cloud impacted margins, forex was surprisingly an offsetting factor. The company has a hybrid and hyperscale cloud spanning multiple jurisdictions, which makes it ideal for multinational companies and banks that have operations all over the world and are required to be in compliance with laws of the countries in which they operate. This is what Microsoft says has drawn some of the world’s largest banks to Azure. Microsoft also offers 33K cloud services, which helps it capture big customers like Boeing, Rolls-Royce and Schneider Electric. Another important customer it won in the fourth quarter was Facebook, which currently uses Office 365 for its 13K employees. For fiscal first-quarter of 2017, Microsoft expects Productivity & Business Process revenues of $6.4-6.6 billion, Intelligent Cloud revenues of $6.1-$6.3 billion and More Personal Computing revenues of around $8.7-9.0 billion. This amounts to total revenue between $21.2 billion and $21.9 billion. Microsoft expects COGS of $7.5-$7.6 billion, opex of $7.35-$7.45 billion and other income/expense of $0. 10 Stocks That Every Investor Should Own Management said that 2017 opex will be in a range of $31.1-$31.4 billion as investments in strategic growth opportunities continue. Non GAAP tax rate is expected to be 20% (+/-2%), depending on the variability of factors such as mix of services revenue versus licensing revenues, the geographic mix of revenues and the timing of equity. A higher mix of cloud revenues is also expected to increase the tax rate. Earnings Whispers Look Good for MSFT  Our proven model does not conclusively show that Microsoft will beat earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below. Zacks ESP: Both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at 68 cents per share. Hence, the difference is 0.00%. Zacks Rank: Microsoft has a Zacks Rank #2, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult. We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions momentum. MICROSOFT CORP Price and EPS Surprise MICROSOFT CORP Price and EPS Surprise | MICROSOFT CORP Quote Other Tech Stocks to Consider You could consider the following stocks with a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank: Asure Software Inc (ASUR), with an Earnings ESP of +14.29% and Zacks Rank #1. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here. Barracuda Networks Inc (CUDA), with an Earnings ESP of +25.00% and Zacks Rank #1. Barracuda Networks Inc. (NYSE:CUDA) a Big Buy after Earnings NetApp Inc. (NTAP), with an Earnings ESP of +2.63% and a Zacks Rank #1.

Here’s how it could affect the markets   1 by Bryan Borzykowski October 17th, 2016 Online only.   1 Share: Facebook Twitter Google+ Share LinkedIn Email U.S. elections are known for their outsized hyperbole, but once the ballots are cast any lingering concerns about what it could mean for Canada-U.S. trade typically dissipate. But this is not your typical U.S. election. Canadian investors anxiously awaiting the outcome are smartly asking what it could mean for their portfolios. There is no shortage of bravado in the prognostications about what a Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton win would mean for the markets. Mark Cuban, tech entrepreneur and owner of the Dallas Mavericks, is convinced a Trump win would plunge stock markets and upend the bond market, should he find a way to follow through on a plan to renegotiate the U.S. national debt. Whereas Marc Faber, a respected market voice and author of the “Gloom, Boom & Doom Report”, cautions Clinton’s US$1 trillion tax hike “will destroy the whole world.” As divergent as these viewpoints are, the takeaway is clear: The outcome of the U.S. election will impact your money. Depending on who gets into the Oval Office, our economy, and our portfolios, could be in for a wild ride, even if it’s much less dramatic than the destruction of the world. If you’re looking for prognostications, there are hundreds—mostly in the event of a Republican win. Some have even the 13% run up in the S&P/TSX Composite this year is due in part to large U.S. investors positioning their portfolios in the event of a Trump win. Here’s a sample: Invest in companies that are sensitive to exchange rates like Dollarama and Baytex, because a Trump win would put pressure on the U.S. dollar and lift the loonie. Buy Lockheed Martin Corp., Northrop Grumman Corp. and Boeing Co., as they’d benefit from increased defence spending. Be on the lookout for The GEO Group, the private prison real estate investment trust, which would likely be an important cog in Trump’s pledge to round up and deport illegal immigrants. And lastly don’t forget Cemex, the Mexican cement company—because if they’re going to pay for the wall, then they aren’t going to buy American. For the political neophyte, reality TV has never been so captivating. For investors, it’s unnerving. If you’re rooting—or cringing—on the sidelines, Clinton is the better bet for your portfolio. Trump is such a divisive figure that markets around the world will likely experience more volatility under his watch, says Stephen Lingard, a portfolio manager with Franklin Templeton Solutions. The former First Lady, on the other hand, represents the status quo. Expect volatility if Trump beats the odds » Before you start altering your portfolio, here is a look at some of the larger ways a Clinton or Trump win would affect Canadian portfolios. Let’s start with Trump. Trump on trade Trump is trying to capitalize on a populist anti-trade sentiment in the U.S.  The Republican Presidential nominee’s feelings for the Trans-Pacific Partnership and the North American Free Trade Agreement is clear, repeatedly saying he would love to tear them up. At least when it comes to the TPP, Clinton and Trump appear to be somewhat on the same page. The Democratic Presidential Nominee agrees the TPP has its flaws, even though she once supported it, and now pledges to renegotiate the agreement if elected. Trade is the issue that will impact us the most, says Lingard. The North American economy has more than doubled in size since NAFTA was signed in 1994. According to Global Affairs Canada, “NAFTA has had an overwhelmingly positive effect on the Canadian economy,” and its increased trilateral trade within North American from $288 billion in 1993 to more than $1 trillion in 2015. If NAFTA changed in any significant way, Lingard says it could send Canada into a recession. Scrapping the TPP may not plunge Canada into recession since the agreement isn’t in force, but it could hobble future growth. In September, André Downs, chief economist at the department of Global Affairs Canada, said that the TPP would expand economic output by $4.3 billion thanks to increased access to hard-to-tap markets like Japan. Crossing the border could be harder under Trump » A Trump win would be positive for Canadian stocks Beyond trade, though, the differences between the two candidates are much more pronounced. Matthew Barasch a Canadian equity strategist at RBC Capital Markets, goes as far to say that Trump presidency would be good for Canada. Barasch zeros in on Trump’s tax cuts. “The broad cuts of the magnitude that Mr. Trump is calling for would most likely provide a big boost to the U.S. economy, at least for a period of time, and considering that the U.S. remains by far Canada’s largest trading partner, the flow through to Canadian growth would likely be fairly meaningful,” he writes in a note to clients. Are low interest rates doing more harm than good? If you are willing to put your portfolio before the environment then Trump is good news again. Barasch argues that Trump’s energy policy would be another positive for Canada. Trump is a major proponent of Keystone, a pipeline that would likely spur investment in the oil sands. Iran becomes another wildcard under a Trump presidency. “Should the nuclear agreement with Iran be jeopardized in any way and thus Iranian barrels be put at risk, the positive impact on oil prices could be significant,” writes Barasch in his note. On the flip side, Trump’s plan would reduce federal revenues by $9.5 trillion over 10 years, and that would require the government to massively reduce spending, which could negatively affect Americans, according to the Tax Policy Center. Will markets rally around Clinton? If Clinton gets elected, not much would change, says Bob Sewell, president and CEO of Oakville’s Bellwether Investment Management, though one policy that could impact Canadian health care companies is her desire to cap drug pricing. She’s also said that she’s against Keystone XL, but that she does want North America to invest more in clean energy, which our Prime Minister has expressed an interest in as well. Healthcare stocks might fall under Clinton, while energy companies and defence operations could see gains under Trump. It’s worth noting that overall, markets have done better under a Democrat president than a Republican one. On average, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has a 7% annualized return under a Democrat leader, while it’s only grown by 3% annualized under a Republican, according to Bespoke Investment Group. All that said, it’s likely that stocks will see more ups and downs as the election draws nearer, and especially if the race tightens even further, says Sewell. He’s getting more cautious and says that now’s not the time to be taking any sort of substantial risks. “Reduce your beta, reduce the volatility of your equity holdings and keep more cash in your pocket,” he says.   Share: Facebook Twitter Google+ Share LinkedIn Email Advertisement Advertisement    Show comments Hide comments (1) One comment on “What Trump could mean for your portfolio” Too many grammatical or spelling errors Reply ↓ Don Dutton on October 17, 2016 at 4:09 pm Leave a comment Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

WikiLeaks just released the 9th set of intercepted emails from Hillary Clinton’s campaign boss John Podesta. The current batch contains clues that suggest corporate control mechanisms that lead straight to President Obama. © AP Photo/ Twitter via AP WikiLeaks Releases 9th Batch of Clinton Campaign Chairman's EmailsAt least one email shows how those mechanisms ultimately affect United States policy abroad. As election day approaches, more and more evidence suggests Donald Trump is right in his accusations that a corporate oligarchy runs America. By now all the world knows about Obama administration’s funding and arming of so-called “moderates” inside Syria. It’s also widely accepted Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Jordan, and Turkey have ended up assisting terrorists. What few people understand, however, is exactly how America’s foreign policy on Syria was and is formulated. Most people assume Barack Obama and his cabinet hashed out the now failed scheme to overthrow Assad and to install “somebody” or “something” in his place. The “somebody” is still ambiguous if anyone ever had a plan for after Assad. Just “who” formulated this “genius” plan to kill terror is made clearer by the communiqués of Podesta, who’s the former Chief of Staff to President Bill Clinton, Counselor to President Barack Obama, and aspiring Hillary Clinton Chief of Staff. The email entitled; “Re: Here's where we are coming down on recommendations,” from August of 2014 to Vikram Singh, who’s Vice President for National Security and International Policy at American Progress (CAP), may finally tell us who runs American policy. “Nearly all men can stand adversity, but if you want to test a man's character, give him power.” – Abraham Lincoln © AFP 2016/ JIM BOURG / POOL Hillary Clinton's Leaked Emails Show US Aware of Qatar, Saudi Arabia Supporting DaeshSimplification has never been my journalistic strong-suit, but characterizing the disease Washington politics has become easier than I ever imagined. Giving people like John Podesta too much power is a time proven method for screwing up. Ask anyone who ever knew disgraced President Richard Nixon. This new batch WikiLeaks cable pulls the curtain back on a land of political “Wizards of Oz” in America’s capital. When Podesta was characterized as a kind of “savior” for the Obama White House by Politico back in early 2014, somebody should have been watchful of the trouble to come. The magazine offered this about his “unofficial” position with Obama: “…his (Podesta’s) impact is being felt throughout the West Wing, where he’s helping the Obama White House, five years in, grow up.” Now we begin to see why hackers picked on John Podesta, if the gravity of his role spirals any further downward, he’ll be on the same book circuit as H. R. Haldeman. It is my believe Assange has found the “go between” in the middle of a controlled White House, a government Trump and others say is a sellout. Keep mental track of Podesta’s email recipient at the Center for American Progress, Vikram Singh, while I frame this a bit better. Some months before Politico framed Podesta as a “second coming” of a political advising god, The Nation ran a story about the secret donors behind CAP. Ken Silverstein, the author of the piece, received a lot of flack from CAP’s chief mouthpiece, Andrea Purse. © AP Photo/ Manu Brabo, File WikiLeaks Podesta Files: Hillary’s No-Fly Zone Means ‘Killing a Lot of Syrians’The article focuses on the unusual activities surrounding CAP’s donors/sponsors and foreign policy toward Turkey, for instance. Not many people realize it was John Podesta who founded the Center for American Progress, but the fact The Nation reportage implicated CAP for being a corporate control mechanism back in 2013 is a bombshell all its own. The Podesta efforts toward the Turkey-America business end of things now looms large. Silberstein pretty much had the goods on Podesta and the bigger corporate levers in Washington, but few noticed. No wonder Podesta is now taking pot shots at Julian Assange, he’s all done in Washington if worse comes to worse. Here’s another revelation from Silverstein: “A confidential CAP donor pitch I obtained describes the Business Alliance as “a channel for engagement with the corporate community” that provides “the opportunity to…collaborate on common interests. It offers three membership levels, with the perks to top donors ($100,000 and up) including private meetings with CAP experts and executives, round-table discussions with Hill and national leaders, and briefings on CAP reports relevant to your unique interests.” The Nation unknowingly discovered a way for Donald Trump to fend off allegations he and Russia’s Vladimir Putin are in cahoots, for Silverstein uncovered the fact sister think tanks The Atlantic Council took donations from Kazakhstan and Nursultan Nazarbayev! I doubt you find that tidbit in the New York Times tomorrow, though. © AFP 2016/ Jim Watson Obama’s Legacy: US Strategy of Chaos Got Out of ControlAccording to Silverstein’s investigations, the CAP is propped up by donations from the likes of Comcast, Walmart, General Motors, Pacific Gas and Electric, General Electric, Boeing, and Lockheed. As a potent note here, it’s probably no coincidence Zack’s just announced in June a Lockheed helicopter deal for $3.5 billion for the TUHP-Turkish Utility Helicopter Program, or that Boeing and Turkish Airlines just inked a new deal. If my suspicions are right, lots of deals will be finalized before Obama leaves office. What about the Syria-Podesta-CAP-Obama connection, you ask? Well, besides the fact the chief Obama think tank man is sending Singh at CAP containing vital intel foreign nationals may be interested in, via gmail  (Ouch!), this is about Barack Obama forging policies for America almost perfectly aligned with an NGO’s recommendations. The Podesta-Singh mail exchange seems to be a draft copy of Syria/ISIL policy Obama ended up using. CAP recommended five steps to advance the objectives of the United States. The steps were fairly detailed but mirror US actions after the date of the email. After that, the communiqué also reveals the level of failure in these CAP recommendations, as well as Obama, Podesta, and Hillary Clinton foreknowledge they knew about Saudi Arabia and other Gulf entities: “One area in which these countries should take more action is cracking down on private financing that flows from some Gulf countries to terrorist groups such as ISIS—and the United States should increase its Treasury and Justice Department efforts to cut the financial links between the Gulf and extremist groups such as ISIS.” As we can see now, no valid effort was made to curtail the monies and arms flowing to Daesh (also known as ISIS/ISIL/IS/ Islamic State). Secondly, no sustained or real effort was ever made by CENTCOM to destroy Daesh oil revenues; it was Russia’s Ministry of Defense that first blasted terrorist black market oil tankers on YouTube. © REUTERS/ Leonhard Foeger Oil, Power and Daesh: World Leaders to Talk Libya Amid Security ConcernsThe cable in question also damns CAP for being the first to suggest to the US president the need to arm Assad’s opposition. Furthermore, it reveals the “think tank’s” erroneous strategic pondering by creating an armed force pinched in between two powerful combatants, the Syrian Army on one front, and Daesh on the other. This strategy alludes to military morons at CAP, and I am sure the “moderates” really appreciate being put in that cauldron today. Further “advisement” by CAP shows my point AND the reason Daesh still exists: “In the event that ISIS comes to pose a credible and direct threat to the United States, we should be prepared to undertake limited air strikes against ISIS targets inside Syria.” Clearly, these “geniuses” never played military strategy board games as kids, but the larger indications are far more damning. They speak of the refugees, the war, and these plans as if it is a game. As a writer, reading these calculating assessments reveals a disturbing fact about our leadership – their utter detachment from any conscience or accountability. Podesta, the CAP people, and ultimately Obama himself come off like bean-counters at a big bank, callous as hell over the human loss or misery. They even discuss altering Americas laws to suit their agenda: “While the threat to the United States does not yet appear to be imminent, the evolution of ISIS in Iraq and Syria may well require the United States to update the legal framework developed after the September 11th attacks to ensure any president has the authority to combat terrorist groups that threaten America with proper oversight from Congress and accountability to the American public.” © AFP 2016/ DON EMMERT New WikiLeaks Dump Reveals 1000s of Emails from Clinton Campaign Chair PodestaSo here is where we are, the American people have been asleep at the controls of a runaway policy train. The people behind the liberals in America (the Boeings let’s say) have begun steering the engine of America off the tracks. Podesta and his cohorts, whoever they are, have been given far too much power, and far too much leeway. Amazingly, and with the utmost irony, if it were not for Julian Assange and the people of WikiLeaks, we would know nothing of this catastrophic situation. And if Podesta could decide, America and the world would never have known. Think about this for a moment. Obama and other presidents are clearly not running our country; the money interests seem absolutely in control. This explains entirely the steamrolling money machine bent on Hillary for president. As demoralizing and horrid as this is, though, the situation is made worse by the fact we are almost at war with Russia, China, and the “East.” © REUTERS/ Mike Segar Trump Can Still Win US Presidential Election Amid WikiLeaks’ Clinton RevelationsFinally, in all the Podesta and Clinton emails, I have read there are plenty of references to the negative about opponents, Trump especially. One I found made light of how the Republicans put politics above even patriotism, but here’s the thing. I have yet to find one instance of humanity or patriotism in these people’s rhetoric or tone. Not one. There’s speak on “patriotism” in Palestine and elsewhere, but never in America. What I do consistently find is the proof individuals outside the White House running things, and I don’t find the people anywhere in the equation.  The views expressed in this article are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the official position of Sputnik. ...

There is, as they say, a problem. But there’s no use telling Houston—by the time a distress message reaches home more than 30 million miles away, either the astronauts on board will be space dust or humanity will have become an interplanetary species. That’s the premise of National Geographic’s new series, Mars, which mixes documentary and speculation to tell the parallel stories of two groups: the fictional future explorers who will make that first journey, and the pioneers of today—scientists, astronauts, and strategists—who are blazing the trail. In the premier episode, for example, that white-knuckle landing scene is spliced with a look at Elon Musk’s SpaceX as engineers test a real retropropulsion landing system. Every piece of tech in the show was designed to accurately reflect the current scientific vision of how we’ll get to Mars—and to avoid the gaffes that have undermined recent films and invited the wrath of astrophysicist/space ombudsman Neil deGrasse Tyson. As executive producer Ron Howard puts it, “It’s not sci-fi!” (Indeed, President Obama has outlined a vision to send humans into Mars’ orbit by the mid-2030s.) Here’s how Mars envisions our red future. The Crew The Mission The six astronauts in Mars travel to their new home in a rocket called the Daedalus, and their ship is based on science that’s more than simply plausible—it’s coming, and fast. “This is technology that will probably be tested in the next five years,” executive producer Justin Wilkes says. The spacecraft is heavily inspired by SpaceX, but it also borrows design elements from NASA, Boeing, and even the Russian space program. “Other films say ‘Let’s make it look cool,’” production designer Sophie Becher says. “We asked, ‘How’s this going to function? Where are they going to use the bathroom?’” Slide: 1 / of 7 .

Launch While it’s not shown in the series, Daedalus launches from low Earth orbit. Landing In the show, Daedalus lands on the planet directly rather than from an orbital docking station, using a protective aeroshell to absorb the friction of reentry and help the craft decelerate without, y’know, burning up. Supersonic retropropulsion further slows and stabilizes the ship. In the final seconds, legs deploy for greater stability.

Producers picked a specific location on Mars to replicate: the foothills of Olympus Mons, the planet’s tallest mountain, where underground lava tubes provide shelter and protection from cosmic radiation. (Scientists are studying Mars-like isolation in the lava tubes of Mauna Loa volcano in Hawaii.) The first Mars settlers would construct a bare-bones underground habitat in the tubes; over time, future missions would deliver additional materials, and the colony would expand, module by module. Once the original six welcome more inhabitants, this is how they would live. Slide: 1 / of 6 .

Lava Tubes Subterranean lava tubes may offer the greatest radiation protection, so the show’s fictional settlers will go underground. “It’s like Homo sapiens have returned to our roots as cave dwellers,” ­Wilkes says. “Here we are on a new planet, and we’re huddling in a cave around a pro­verbial fire.” Modular Housing Building on uneven ground in unpredictable conditions without bulldozers and cranes, settlers will have to improvise. The dwelling design is inspired by Buckminster Fuller’s geodesic domes: lightweight, inflatable modular structures that can be connected by flexible concertina-­style corridors. Pieces of Home After consulting with Mae Jemison, who took a brightly hued Swatch watch and some colorful earrings into space, Becher added color to the living area. “No one wants to live in a place that’s completely alien,” Becher says. To make Mars more cozy—and less Star Trek—she spruced up Olympus Town with warm tones and family mementos. Ask an Astronaut How show adviser Mae Jemison kept Mars real. Mae Jemison knows what it’s like to do brave work in dire conditions: She was a Peace Corps medical officer in Liberia and Sierra Leone. She’s also a former astronaut who became the first African American woman in space in 1992, aboard the Endeavour. Today she runs the 100 Year Starship project to support long-term interest in space exploration, and she was an adviser for Mars. It’s a good fit: She has some (very) strong opinions about how Hollywood gets space wrong. What type of astronaut would take such a huge risk to go so very far away? The world has changed because of going to the moon. People think it’s just the astronauts going up into space, but it’s the technology: Magnetic resonance imaging, miniaturization, GPS—we couldn’t have Pokémon Go without it! It’s about the mission and what we’re going to gain from it. These are pioneering days. Why did you start the 100 Year Starship program? Our tagline is “Space isn’t just for billionaires and astronauts.” It’s a place for everyone to participate. But we’re in this time period where our fantasyand our virtual reality havein some ways superseded what we do in reality. Our reality doesn’t seem as thrilling. So how do we include more people and make it more thrilling? How did you advise the producers and the writers for Mars? I wanted to help support the drama and the suspense with plausible operational and physiological activities: What would happen, logistically, in a particular circumstance? So you aren’t saying “Oh, come on now!” What do most movies get wrong about astronauts? When actors play astronauts, they often take them off the deep end. Astronauts are driven, but they’re not crazy. They’re passionate but prac­tical, energetic but measured, decisive but willing tocompromise. What else drives you crazy? When I go to the movies, I can suspend disbelief, as long as it’s not egregious. But would people shout when things go to hell? No. You train so much on so many contingencies, you know how to do things. Think about it: If you’re all screaming on top of each other, you’re not going to be able to work it through. If you can’t hear, that’s a surefire way to get dead. What else? Interstellar did incredible work around relativistic physics, but they couldn’t have given a damn about biology. On Earth, you can’t grow grain and foodstuffs—but you’re driving through lush countryside with trees? You can’t figure out what else to eat? And? When you resort to stuff that physically could not happen. Not like warp drive, but more that somebody didn’t take the time to think this through—like putting a hole in the glove in The Martian. Or my ship is all busted up, so my first reaction is to beat on all the control panels and the switches? What the hell? If I’m already about to die, I’d hit myself in the face before I’d beat on the panels! This article appears in our special November issue, guest-edited by President Barack Obama. Subscribe now.

The benchmark CAC 40 index is currently down 25 points or 0.55 percent at 4,446 in late opening deals after gaining as much as 1.5 percent in the previous session. Airbus shares are little changed. Chief Executive Fabrice Bregier said in a German newspaper Welt daily interview that the aerospace giant aims to overtake its rival Boeing co (BA) in terms of annual plane deliveries by 2020. Energy major Total SA is declining more than 1 percent as oil prices edged lower in European trade on a firmer dollar as well as data showing a rising rig count in the United States. Peugeot is gaining half a percent on a report that the automaker plans to cut more than 2,000 jobs in France next year. In economic releases, a Eurostat report released today showed that Eurozone inflation accelerated as estimated in September to the highest level since late 2014. Inflation rose to 0.4 percent from 0.2 percent in August, matching the preliminary estimate published on September 30. Nonetheless, headline inflation has been below the European Central Bank's target of 'below, but close to 2 percent' since early 2013. Elsewhere, Asian stocks recovered from early losses to end mixed today, while U.S. stock futures indicate a lower open. Oil prices dipped slightly in European trade and London copper prices held above a one-month low, while gold traded flat to slightly higher to hover near four-month lows. by RTT Staff Writer For comments and feedback: editorial@rttnews.com Fed Chatterbox: Economic Preview Week of November 14 Forget Canada: The Best Places To Flee Trump's America These Companies Are Sitting On Mountains Of Cash More Commentary -Global European Shares Seen Up Despite Weak Asian Cues Indian Markets Closed For Public Holiday Asian Markets Mostly Lower Thai Bourse Draws Flat Lead For Monday Indonesia Shares May Find Traction On Monday Hong Kong Shares May Find Support On Monday China Bourse May Flirt With 3,200-Point Level Little Movement Expected For Taiwan Bourse Singapore Market May See Support At 2,800 Points Malaysia Stock Market To Remain Rangebound South Korea Shares May Be Stuck In Neutral Stocks Close Mixed On The Day But Sharply Higher For The Week - U.S. Commentary Stocks Seeing Modest Weakness Following Post-Election Rally - U.S. Commentary European Markets Finish Mostly Lower As Trump Rally Fizzles Stocks Turning In Lackluster Performance In Early Trading - U.S. Commentary <<Previous        118 Articles Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus Follow RTT Editor's Pick Most Read Most Emailed Nasty Gal Files For Bankruptcy Allianz Stock Climbs On Q3 Profit Growth, Confirms FY16 Profit View Walt Disney Q4 Profit Down - Update Forget Canada: The Best Places To Escape Trump's America Continental Stock Dips On Weak Q3 Profit; Sees Strong Earnings In Q4 AstraZeneca Q3 Pre-tax Profit Down On Crestor Generic; Backs FY View Alphabet Cancels Drone Deal With Starbucks As Project Leaders Pushed Out Viacom Q4 Adj.

Source: US Air Force The US Air Force (USAF) briefed six original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) on its UH-1N Huey Replacement Program during an industry day at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base (AFB) in Ohio, it was disclosed on 14 October. AgustaWestland, Airbus, Bell Helicopter, Boeing, Northrop Grumman, and Sikorsky, were each briefed during the event in late September, as were a number of sub-contractors including FLIR Systems, GE Aviation, L-3 Communications, Orbital ATK, and Rockwell Collins. The industry day follows the release on 9 September of a Request for Information (RfI) for the procurement of up to 84 new helicopters to replace the USAF's ageing Bell UH-1N 'Huey' platforms. The industry day briefing schedule posted on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website did not disclose potential platform offerings, but given the RfI requirement that they be "of the same configuration" as the UH-1N it is possible to identify some likely candidates. Bell Helicopter could offer to refurbish and upgrade the USAF's UH-1Ns as the OEM, or could offer the 412 (an improved variant of the 212, on which the UH-1N is based), or even the UH-1Y Venom as fielded by the US Marine Corps. Airbus has a number of potentially suitable offerings in its portfolio, chief of which would be the EC145 flown by the US Army as the UH-72A Lakota, or the latest-variant H145 / H145M. AgustaWestland has previously offered its AW139 for the predecessor Common Vertical Lift Support Platform (CVLSP) programme, and could do so again for this latest effort, while Sikorsky will no doubt offer its ubiquitous UH-60 Black Hawk (the USAF's preferred choice before the requirement was opened up to competition). Boeing's and Northrop Grumman's interest in the programme is harder to gauge, given that the former does not have a helicopter in its portfolio in the same configuration as the UH-1N, and the latter has no manned helicopter at all.

Home Fe columnist MSMEs eye defence windfall, but here’s what they must do first MSMEs eye defence windfall, but here’s what they must do first It is imperative for Indian MSMEs to integrate themselves into the global supply chain of defence majors New Delhi | Published: October 17, 2016 6:15 AM The Defence Procurement Procedure (DPP), announced recently, finally delivers Indian MSMEs, a growth opportunity they have long been waiting for. The advantages that MSMEs will leverage are their innovative capabilities in niche manufacturing, greater flexibility, lower overhead costs and their ability to learn and absorb new technologies quickly. MSME sector already contributes a significant 38% to the nation’s GDP and 40% and 45% to the overall exports and manufacturing output, respectively. It is engaged in the manufacturing of over 6,000 products ranging from traditional to hi-tech items. However, till now the MSMEs contribution in defence sector was limited to just 9%. According to figures shared by the defence minister, Manohar Parrikar, last year procurement from MSMEs reached 9%, and in the current year, it will reach 15%. Volumes are also set to increase from R40,000 crore in 2014, to R52,000 crore in the current year. There are nearly 6,000 MSMEs across the country supplying components and sub-assemblies to the DPSUs, ordnance factories, DRDO and private industries. As per latest industry reports, India’s defence budget accounted for nearly 17.2% of the total central government expenditure, at R19.78 lakh crore (about $294.36 billion). In terms of defence spends as a percentage of the GDP, India stands fifth globally. Nearly 60% of the defence need is met through imports putting a huge dent on India’s fiscal health. Therefore, boosting ‘Make in India’ initiative via MSMEs and integrating this sector with global supply chain can be a panacea for managing current account deficit, when oil prices rise again. As a sequel to 100% FDI in defence production sector, several foreign majors have already made their entry into India. Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Saab, Bell Helicopter, Rolls Royce, Northrop Gruman, Rolta, BAE Systems, Dassault, Honeywell, Thales and Finmeccanica are some of the big foreign players actively looking at Indian market. These companies will have to depend on MSMEs to meet their offset obligation for a host of purposes: equipment, spares, IT-related services and other techno-commercial services. The government has initiated host of measures for simplification of procedures to policy change for boosting manufacturing in defence sector based on priority of MSMEs Sector, these include:  Allowing 100% FDI in defence sector and announcement of DPP. The new DPP encourages the MSMEs associated with the industry with funding up to 90% of their project’s prototype development cost. Adding another safeguard, the MoD has also stated that it will reimburse the remaining 10% prototype development cost, if the request for proposal (RFP) is not called within a stipulated timeframe after the successful test of prototypes. Outsourcing and Vendor Development Guidelines for DPSUs and OFBs have been formulated and circulated to them. The guidelines also include vendor development for import substitution. The Exchange Rate Variation (ERV) protection has been allowed on foreign exchange component to all Indian companies including private companies in all categories of capital acquisitions. The anomalies in excise duty/custom duty have been removed. Now, Indian industries (public and private) are subjected to the same kind of excise and custom duty levies. The defence products list for the purpose of issuing Industrial Licences (ILs) under IDR Act has been revised and most of the components, parts, sub-systems, testing equipment, and production equipment have been removed from the list. The initial validity of the IL granted under the IDR Act has been increased from 7 years to 15 years with a provision to further extend it by 3 years. The Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the issue of no-objection certificate (NOC) for export of military stores has been revised wherein; end-user certificate (EUC) to be countersigned/stamped by the government authorities has been done away with for the export of parts, components, sub-systems, etc. With these policy shifts taking place, MSMEs can complement large defence hardware manufacturing industries as ancillary units in time to come. In the case of indigenous manufacture of defence hardware, a substantial portion of the work can be transferred to the MSMEs by the DPSUs and OEMs. They can now act as strategic partners with DPSUs, foreign defence manufacturers and the larger corporates. The first steps have to come from MSME-based industries followed by a government push. MSMEs need to understand OEM expectations in terms of quality and supply commitments which require them to invest in technology, research and manpower training in anticipation of a contract. The government and private players have acknowledged the fact that India needs to increase self-reliance in defence production. Today, it is imperative for Indian companies, especially MSMEs, to integrate themselves to global supply chains of national and international defence majors, to reduce dependence on foreign supplies.

(Lindsey Wasson / The Seattle Times) As leaders in King, Pierce and Snohomish counties, we represent 3.5 million people. And we share an interest in making sure that all of those people, and a million more to come, can get where they need to go. With Proposition 1, we have the plan. Now we need your vote. Share story By Dow Constantine, Dave Somers and Marilyn Strickland Special to The Times WE hear it all the time: Somebody’s got to do something about traffic. Gridlock is stealing time from our families and money from our pocketbooks. And with each new person — about 236 every day — congestion on our roads and highways gets worse and worse. For more than three years, commuters, community members and transportation experts participated in an intense conversation about how to move the greatest number of people — especially with increased backups on roads and highways. Dow Constantine is King County executive. And we have the solution: Proposition 1. Proposition 1 would add 62 new miles of light rail with 37 new stations, completing a network that would span 116 miles. Dave Somers is Snohomish County executive. And by expanding Sounder commuter rail, Proposition 1 would allow for 40 percent more passengers to travel from Lakewood, Tacoma, Puyallup, Sumner, Auburn, Kent and Tukwila. Proposition 1 would create bus rapid transit on Interstate 405 and Highway 522, add express buses and improve parking, bicycle and pedestrian access to stations. Marilyn Strickland is mayor of Tacoma. This is the comprehensive system our region has needed for 40 years. And light rail is key because it carries more people, more reliably. When completed, Proposition 1 would connect Everett, Tacoma, Ballard, West Seattle, Bellevue, Redmond, Kirkland and Issaquah. Twenty hours of service each day, with a train every three to six minutes at peak times. We know our transportation future includes cars, buses, car-shares and autonomous vehicles. But nothing — not new highway lanes, not self-driving cars — can move the number of people, nor move them as reliably, as light rail. Proposition 1 wouldn’t make our highways traffic-free. With a million more of us living here over the next three decades, nothing will. Light rail does more than change commutes. It provides access to jobs and education.” But Proposition 1 would give you options to avoid getting stuck. Just ask the 100,000-plus riders who took light rail on Sept. 30 to the Huskies’ or Mariners’ games. No panicky apprehension about missing kickoff or the first pitch. No circling the neighborhood in search of parking. No staring at brake lights all the way home.

Have you seen the faces of the tens of thousands more people who are leaving the car at home since light rail opened to Capitol Hill and at the University of Washington? Relaxed. Free from the stress of fighting traffic. Free from the worry of being late to work or late getting home to the kids or grandkids. And light rail does more than change commutes. It provides access to jobs and education. It encourages new investments in housing so people can live in vibrant neighborhoods linked by transit. It creates family-wage jobs. It provides an alternative to the automobile, our region’s single largest source of climate pollution. It improves our quality of life. The cost of Proposition 1 is $53.8 billion in year-of-expenditure dollars. It would increase the sales tax by 0.5 percent, license tabs by 0.8 percent and property tax by 25 cents for each $1,000 of assessed value. For the average adult, that’s $14 per month. (You can find the Sound Transit calculator here.) Opponents say the investments aren’t worth it. They throw around a lot of numbers and then claim the measure doesn’t pencil out. But remember, these folks always say, “Not this time, not this plan.” It’s true. Sometimes light rail or express bus isn’t right for a trip to the dry cleaner or day care. But that doesn’t mean we don’t need it. High-capacity systems are intended to move the most people quickly and predictably, especially at rush hour, to key destinations, including job centers like Costco, Amazon, Microsoft and Boeing. So it’s no surprise that those companies and many others support Proposition 1, along with environmental, labor and community groups. City councils including Bellevue’s, Issaquah’s, Redmond’s, Shoreline’s, Auburn’s, Tukwila’s, Kenmore’s and Tacoma’s have endorsed Proposition 1. This measure truly represents our entire region coming together around a common option to avoid gridlock and a stifled economy. Proposition 1 is an investment in our future. The benefits would begin as soon as the service expands and would continue long past the system’s completion. A Citizen Oversight Panel, our local elected officials and state, federal and private-sector auditors would oversee construction and operations. As leaders in King, Pierce and Snohomish counties, we represent 3.5 million people. And we share an interest in making sure that all of those people, and a million more to come, can get where they need to go. With Proposition 1, we have the plan. We have the capability. All we need is your vote. Dow Constantine is King County executive. Dave Somers is Snohomish County executive. Marilyn Strickland is mayor of Tacoma.

 YOUR E-MAIL VERIFICATION CODE Istanbul's new airport is now seeking companies to start leasing spaces to in the first terminal building, which is planned to open Feb. 26, 2018 to serve 90 million passengers annually The Istanbul Grand Airport (IGA) company announced that space leasing processes have started for companies that want to form part of the Istanbul New Airport.While 128 airlines currently fly to 276 destinations in 110 countries from Istanbul's Atatürk International Airport, the third airport will double this number, hosting 250 airlines when completed. IGA will determine rental values per square meter based on the latest public-private cooperation wage scale issued by the General Directorate of State Airports Authority (DHMİ) before the Istanbul New Airport opens. The fee schedule will become official after receiving approval from the DHMİ. IGA has sent invitations to more than 60 airlines and airline service companies to submit their request forms by Nov. 18. The first terminal building, currently under construction on an area of 1.3 million square meters, will have capacity for 90 million passengers annually, and will eventually manage to host 110 million more. This is compared to Atatürk Airport, which currently serves over 60 million passengers on an annual basis with a terminal building of about 400,000 square meters. The first stage of the new airport is planned to open on Feb. 26, 2018. IGA Executive Chairman Hüseyin Keskin said that the company will offer an utterly different passenger and aviation experience in Turkey soon after the airport comes into operation, adding, "The trouble-fee progress of activities, from passenger to cargo services, and from hospitality services to duty-free spots, is crucial for us. With respect to square-meter rental fees, we abide by the fee schedule determined by DHMİ which is one of the most important architects of Turkey's aviation potential and it becoming a leading country in the aviation industry in the future."IGA's invitation for airline companies to make applications attracted great interest, according to Keskin, showing that airlines which already have operations in Turkey want to strengthen their presence, while new companies eye opportunities to offer services to passengers in the country. Keskin stated, "The IGA family are happy to give them this opportunity, make Turkey an important aviation hub and contribute to its competitive environment through this giant airport project." IGA, which was founded to carry out the construction work and operate the airport for 25 years, shared the latest aerial images of the number 1 runway through its social media accounts. Bulky planes like Airbus A380s and Boeing 747s can easily land and take off from the 3,750-meter-long and 60-meter-wide runway. Being constructed on an area of 76.5 million square meters, which is 35 kilometers from the city center, the airport project consists of four stages with different designs. The first phase of the project's first stage consists of two detached parallel runways 1,700 meters apart, two attached runways and a main terminal building that is capable of serving 90 million passengers. Following the finalization of construction work on the second phase of the first stage, the third detached parallel runway will come into service. When all phases are completed, the airport will be able to host 200 million passengers a year, as well as providing flights to more than 350 destinations and serving more than 150 airlines. The airport will provide 100,000 new jobs on its own and 1.5 million through secondary sectors. The 1.4 million-square-meter Cargo City within the airport's customs zone will include 300 cargo agency offices, on which the book-building process has already begun. There are three different price categories for 300 offices varying in size between 13 and 19 square meters.

The vendors are identified taking into account their revenue, technology, geographical presence, and end-users. The global torque sensor market was valued at USD 1.20 billion in 2015 and is likely to reach USD 1.92 billion by 2020, growing at a CAGR of almost 10% during the forecast period. The market is largely driven by the automotive industry, as torque sensors are widely used in various automobile components for torque measurement. Competitive vendor landscape The global torque sensor market is a highly technology intensive market. Vendors compete with each other on the basis of technological advances in their products and the delivery of high-quality and accuracy in measurement of torque. Industries require customized torque sensors to monitor and measure the torque acting on a variety of machine components. While large scale industries and MNCs prefer to procure torque sensors through well established players in the market, SMEs and small scale industries usually face budget constraints in procurement from larger vendors. Consecutively, SMEs focus on procurement of torque sensors via smaller domestic or local players, as they get customized solutions at affordable prices. Due to the presence of a large number of vendors, both large scale and small scale, the global torque sensor market is highly fragmented. The lack of technological standardization in the market further intensifies the competition, as vendors are open to use their preferred technologies for torque sensors. These technologies are governed by quality and safety standards. "Industries also have the flexibility to get customized torque sensors based on their preferences and thus, the scope of expansion in providing customized torque measurement solutions to industries is extensive," says Navin Rajendra, an industry expert at Technavio for sensors research.

There are three distinct models that take off and land in conventional ways, do short takeoffs and vertical landings, and that are launched from air craft carriers using a catapult. Last year, a squadron of F-35B fighters tailor made for the Marines was first declared ready for deployment, and this summer those aircraft withstood intensive testing at Eglin Air Force Base in Florida. Also last August, the Air Force declared its F-35A Lightning II fighter jet “combat ready,” marking another important milestone for the controversial aircraft. “It has been trash-talked a lot, but this is one mean machine and it will prove its combat value,” Rebecca Grant, president of the Washington-based firm IRIS Independent Research and a consultant to the Air Force, told FoxNews.com. “It’s ready to go to war, it’s ready to keep the peace.” Ironically, just as the F-35 is getting up to speed, the Air Force and Navy have begun preliminary planning for a long-term successor to the single seat F-35 jet fighter – one that includes futuristic features that once seemed out of reach. Twenty years from now, fighter jets likely will contain the latest breakthroughs in stealth technology, sophisticated computer processing and algorithms, hypersonic weapons and “smart-skins.” Those smart-skins are sensors that would be built into the aircraft itself to reduce drag assure maximum connectivity with battle field intelligence-gathering technology. Writing last weekend in the on-line defense systems publication Scout Warrior, managing editor Kris Osborn observed that some of these unique characteristic may already have been on display early this year when Northrop Grumman aired a commercial during the Super Bowl revealing “a flashy first look” at its concept of a new sixth-generation fighter jet. Northrop Grumman is almost certain to be competing with Boeing-Lockheed and other major defense manufacturer for the contract to build the next generation of fighter jets when the time is ripe. “Maximum connectivity would mean massively increased communications and sensor technology such as having an ability to achieve real-time connectivity with satellites, other aircraft and anything that could provide relevant battlefield information,” Osborn wrote in assessing the evolving design. He said that the new aircraft might be equipped to fire hypersonic weapons, although such a design breakthrough would hinge on “successful progress with yet-to-be proven technologies such as scramjets traveling at hypersonic speeds.” So far, early testing of this technology has been a mixed bag.  Related: F-35 Nears Production, but It’s Still Having Trouble Booting Up  The Air Force and Navy reportedly are holding joint conceptual talks about the technologies and capabilities of the future sixth-generation fighter aircraft, according to Scout Warrior. While the Air Force has not yet identified a platform for the new aircraft, the Navy’s new aircraft will at least partly replace the existing inventory of F/A-18 Super Hornets, which will be retired beginning in 2035, according to Navy officials.

Veteran of the Week Lew McCreary� HIROSHI SAKAHARA of Conroe, Texas Hiro is second generation Japanese American (Nisei) and he is 93. At 18 he volunteered (US Army) after a six months stint harvesting sugar beets in Montana. The army told him that if a regiment (3000 men) of Japanese American could be raised and trained for a year they would fight in the European Theatre of War as the 442nd Regiment, serving in regimental combat teams. Even so, at that time other branches of US armed services discriminated against them early on. After training (Camp Shelby) they shipped out for Naples, Italy in converted Liberty ships then deployed up north of Rome. He was part of the 5th Army, traveling on foot and by truck to the front opposite the German adversaries. By late 42 they had pushed them back north as Hiro carried ammo at first, then the BAR (automatic rifle) itselfand made PFC. They dug fox holes each night led by American officersand later redeployed to southern France, then eastern France where they helped the US 36th Divisiona bunch of Texans who were temporarily cut off by the Axis Powers. They made Hiro an honorary Texan! He also received a Congressional Gold Medal in 2011. Combat in France was some of the most perilous because of winter and the German artillery that fired down burst salvos in the Bruyers Forest. Many officers and enlisted were casualties on Hill #140. Therefore they waited on replacements, then moved back to northern Italy. It was spring of 44 when Hiro pulled guard duty until May when Germany surrendered. He returned to New York harbor aboard an aircraft carrier and released in Utah during June. Hiro put his agricultural skills to use raising fruit in Idaho for a season before selling out and attending U. of Illinois and Purdue securing a B.A. in electrical engineering. It prepared him well for employment with major corporationslike Douglas Aircraft, Hercules Powder, Brown & Root, Fluor Corporation and Boeing Aircraft. During in a small prayer group membership in college he had earlier gotten saved, and married Alice. They raised four children together. Very paramount to Hiro...hed experienced the saving grace of Jesus Christ. Compared to his Shinto ancestors traditional beliefs in Japan, this spiritual awakening dramatically changed his personal life for eternity. Until recently Hiro lived in Sun City, TX., but now resides in assisted living near Rivershire to be closer to his daughter Ruth. Would Hiro change any aspects of his life journey had he the opportunity? Certainly notdespite the persecution endured due to President Roosevelts Internment Policy for Japanese Americans whose only flaw was having ancestors in Japan and Hiro is not bitter. Shortly after Pearl Harbor nearly 130,000 Japanese Americans spent most of WW II in 10 resettlement locations that were more like concentration camps. They were torn away from their homes, assets and even family pets. Known as Nisei (rhymes with we say), they were first sent to assembly points, then relocation centers before incarceration behind barbed wire fences, guards and machine guns. Most of these locations were in western USA, two in Texas, and with some in the midwest and east. Not a single resident alien Niseior American of Japanese ancestry, committed sabotage or espionage during WW IIand by 43-44 many had relocated westward from Midwestern and eastern camps. Unfortunately there had been more than 100 instances of US race-baiters committing arson, beatings and shootings against Nisei. By late 44 the Supreme Court ruled Nisei could not be detained, and the Pacific coast was also re-opened. By 1948 amounts of compensation had been distributed, but Hiros came in the 70s. Nisei received ill treatment despite the fact that 10,000 served America with honor in both theatres of war. Many sacrificed their lives for their homeland. What advice would Hiro give to graduating US seniors? Hiros response is to first develop a love relationship with Jesus Christ, then go to college and earn a degree.

The 14-story-tall rocket, powered by a pair of new Russian-made engines, lifted off from Wallops Island at 7:45pm, a NASA TV broadcast showed. Launch was delayed five minutes to give the team extra time to review their checklists, Orbital president Frank Culbertson told reporters. “It’s such a feeling of elation to see the vehicle take off... I’m very happy to see Antares back,” Orbital director of program engineering Amanda Davis said. The rocket carried a Cygnus capsule loaded with 2,400kg of food, supplies, equipment and science experiments for the space station, a US$100 billion laboratory in orbit about 400km above Earth. The capsule is expected to reach the station on Sunday after lingering several days in orbit to allow time for a Russian Soyuz capsule carrying three new crew members to reach the outpost on Friday. The Soyuz is slated to launch today from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan. DOWNTIME The last Antares launch, on Oct. 28, 2014, ended in disaster a few seconds after liftoff due to a problem with the booster’s refurbished, Soviet-era engines. After the accident, Orbital sped up plans to replace the motors. During the downtime, Orbital bought rides for two Cygnus cargo ships aboard Atlas rockets, built and flown by United Launch Alliance, a partnership of Lockheed Martin Corp and Boeing Co. Orbital conducted a 30-second engine test firing of the Antares at the Virginia launch pad on May 31, but had never flown the refurbished rocket before Monday. The mission became more crucial for the US space agency after a Sept. 1 accident destroyed a Falcon 9 rocket operated by Elon Musk’s SpaceX and a US$200 million Israeli communications satellite. The accident, which occurred while the rocket was being fueled for a routine prelaunch test, has temporarily grounded SpaceX, the only company apart from Orbital contracted by NASA to fly cargo to the space station. Private contractors for the cargo runs became necessary following the retirement of the space shuttles in 2011. With SpaceX sidelined, NASA said it added extra food, clothing, laptop computers and spacesuit parts to the Cygnus cargo list. This story has been viewed 857 times. Comments will be moderated.

He promised to work with private companies, “to build new habitats that can sustain and transport astronauts on long-duration missions in deep space.” “We have set a cler goal vital to the next chapter of America’s story in space: sending humans to Mars by the 2030s and returning them safely to Earth, with the ultimate ambition to one day remain there for an extended time,” Obama wrote in an opinion editorial for CNN. He mentioned leading scientists and engineers from around the U.S. will soon meet in Pittsburgh to discuss the plan. In 2010 Obama set a goal to send humans to Mars by the 2030s. This reiteration demonstrates he is still committed six years later. The U.S. government has also awarded contracts to six companies to build prototypes for space habitats capable of sustaining human life in deep space. One of which is already attached to the International Space Station. These private companies will soon ferry astronauts to and from the ISS, wrote Obama. Private sector interests in space have been on the rise, such as Elon Musk’s SpaceX which has spent the last few years developing and testing reusable rockets. Musk recently revealed his plan to get humans to Mars in the next decade. He pitched the journey as insurance for the human race should we befall some catastrophic event, which he said is likely at some point. The SpaceX founder hopes to send a craft with at least 100 people to Mars in as little as 80 days of travel. Such a journey is likely to be incredibly challenging both technologically and economically, Musk acknowledged, and will require cooperation between both the private and public sectors. “Right now, we’re just trying to make as much progress as we can with the resources we have available to keep moving forward,” said Musk. “And if we show that this is possible, that this dream is real — not just a dream but something that can be made real — I think the support will snowball over time.” The increase in collaboration in space related projects between government and private entities has been the trend the last few years ; since 2011 when the U.S. ended their 30-year space shuttle program, losing the ability to send astronauts to the ISS. This duty has been picked up by private companies such as SpaceX and Boeing. “Just five years ago, US Companies were shut out of the global commercial launch market. Today, thanks to groundwork laid by the men and women of NASA, they own more than a third of it. More than 1,000 companies across nearly all 50 states are working on private space initiatives,” wrote Obama. “If we make our leadership in space even stronger in this century than it was in the last, we won’t just benefit from related advances in energy, medicine, agriculture and artificial intelligence, we’ll benefit from a better understanding of our environment and ourselves.” 2016governmentmarsObamapolitics About Luiz Brasil View all posts by Luiz Brasil → Tweet Pin It Related Posts Late Trent comeback ends Brock’s bid for...

The Pressure is On for SLS Hardware in Upcoming Test by Kim Henry for MSFC News Huntsville AL (SPX) Oct 18, 2016 A test version of the launch vehicle stage adapter (LVSA) for NASA's Space Launch System rocket is loaded into the test stand at the agency's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama. Two simulators and four qualification articles of the upper part of the SLS will be stacked in the stand and subjected to forces similar to those experienced in flight. The LVSA joins the core stage simulator, which was loaded into the test stand Sept. 21. The other three qualification articles and the Orion simulator will complete the stack later this fall. Image courtesy NASA/MSFC/Brian Massey. For a larger version of this image please go here. Engineers are getting ready to put the pressure on hardware for the world's most powerful rocket, NASA's Space Launch System, as part of a rigorous test series to ensure each structure can withstand the incredible stresses of launch. SLS and the agency's Orion spacecraft will travel to new destinations in deep space as NASA continues to prepare for its Journey to Mars. "Not only is this series more cost effective by testing several qualification articles together, but it also helps us to understand how the flight-like hardware will interface together," said Mike Roberts, mechanical team lead in the Engineering Directorate at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama. A 65-foot-tall test stand at Marshall is being readied for the upcoming test series, where two simulators and four qualification articles of the upper part of the SLS will be stacked and then pushed, pulled and twisted by forces similar to those experienced in flight. "We have to make sure all the hardware is structurally sound and will not compromise under the incredible amounts of force," said Dee VanCleave, lead test engineer for the structural loads test at Marshall. "The best way to verify these major structures are ready for launch is to test them." The qualification articles and simulators will be stacked in order from bottom to top in a test structure with "spiders" - given that name because the hardware has 8-16 legs that span out from the center. The spider's design helps distribute the load evenly in the test stand. The pieces are: + Core stage simulator - a duplicate of the top of the SLS core stage that is approximately 10 feet tall and 27.5 feet in diameter. It was designed and built at Marshall. + Launch vehicle stage adapter (LVSA) - connects the SLS core stage and the interim cryogenic propulsion stage (ICPS). The ICPS is a liquid oxygen/liquid hydrogen-based system that will give Orion the big, in-space push needed to fly beyond the moon before it returns to Earth on the first flight of SLS in 2018. The LVSA test hardware is 26.5 feet tall, with a bottom diameter of 27.5 feet and a top diameter of 16.8 feet. It was designed and built by prime contractor Teledyne Brown Engineering of Huntsville. + Frangible joint assembly - part of the separation system on the SLS. The flight version will have small explosive devices installed that will separate the ICPS from the rest of the rocket in space. Only the structural part of the frangible joint assembly is included for this test series. It was designed and built by The Boeing Co. in Huntsville and United Launch Alliance of Decatur. + ICPS - The qualification test article, without the engine, is around 29 feet tall and 16.8 feet in diameter. It will be filled with liquid nitrogen for testing, rather than liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen. "Liquid nitrogen is the safest cryogenic media to use for testing," VanCleave said. The ICPS was designed and built by Boeing and United Launch Alliance. + Orion stage adapter - connects the Orion to the ICPS. It is 4.8 feet tall, with a 16.8-foot bottom diameter and 18-foot top diameter. It was designed and built at Marshall. The adapter technology was used for Orion's first test flight in December 2014. + Orion spacecraft simulator - a replica of the bottom portion of the exploration vehicle that will carry the crew to space, provide emergency abort capability, sustain the crew during the space travel, and provide safe re-entry from deep space return velocities. + The simulator also was designed and built at Marshall, and is 4.5 feet tall and 18 feet in diameter. The qualification articles are almost exact to flight hardware specifications. The core stage simulator was loaded into the test stand Sept. 21, with the LVSA following on Oct. 12. The other three qualification articles and the Orion simulator will complete the stack later this fall. Testing is scheduled to begin in early 2017. Ready, Set, Test Approximately 50 test cases are planned for the series. The qualification test articles will be outfitted with 28 mechanical load lines, which will use hydraulic pressure to push and pull on the test articles. The ICPS tanks also will be filled with liquid nitrogen, which will subject the hardware to pressure as high as 56 pounds per square inch - relative to atmospheric pressure. More than 170,000 pounds of liquid nitrogen will be used in the tanks for most of the load cases, and 500,000 pounds of axial hydraulic force will be applied to the entire test stack. Engineers will not test to failure for this series. Data from the tests will be recorded through 1,900 instrumentation channels, measuring the strain on the test articles, temperature, deflection and other factors. The test data will be compared to computer models to verify the integrity of the hardware and ensure it can withstand the forces it will experience during flight. This also will be a type of practice run for assembly operations before the rocket hardware is stacked in the Vehicle Assembly Building at Kennedy Space Center in Florida ahead of launch. The initial SLS configuration will have a minimum 70-metric-ton (77-ton) lift capability and be powered by twin solid rocket boosters and four RS-25 engines. The next planned upgrade of SLS will use a powerful exploration upper stage for more ambitious missions with a 105-metric-ton (115-ton) lift capacity. A third configuration will add a pair of advanced solid or liquid propellant boosters to provide a 130-metric-ton (143-ton) lift capacity. In each configuration, SLS will continue to use the same core stage and four RS-25 engines.

(AP) — One of NASA's main delivery companies made a triumphant comeback seen up and down the East Coast on Monday night, launching its first space station shipment from Virginia since a rocket explosion two years ago. It was the first flight of Orbital ATK's unmanned Antares rocket since the Oct. 28, 2014, blast that wrecked the pad and destroyed everything on the space station supply run. The launch provided a show for sky gazers along much of the East Coast. Reports poured in via Twitter from observers in Washington, Baltimore, Philadelphia, New York, and even Raleigh, North Carolina. The Orbital ATK Antares rocket, with the Cygnus spacecraft onboard, launches from Pad-0A, Monday, Oct. 17, 2016 at NASA's Wallops Flight Facility in Wallops Island, Va. Orbital ATK's sixth contracted cargo resupply mission with NASA to the International Space Station is delivering over 5,000 pounds of science and research, crew supplies and vehicle hardware to the orbital laboratory and its crew. (Bill Ingalls/NASA via AP) For Antares' long-awaited return, the pad underwent a $15 million restoration, and the rocket got new Russian engines to replace the vintage ones from a half-century earlier. As the Antares streaked through the night sky from NASA's Wallops Flight Facility, it appeared as though all the work had paid off. Launch controllers applauded when the supply ship reached orbit and victory was declared. "It is great to be back," said Frank Culbertson, president of Orbital ATK's space systems group. NASA Administrator Charles Bolden described the launch as "magnificent" and personally thanked the Orbital ATK team. "It's been a very difficult two years, and I can't imagine what those of you in the Orbital team went through. I can't imagine how long you were holding your breath tonight," Bolden told the launch control crowd. "But you know, we made it and that's what's all important." Getting a lift from the Antares was Orbital ATK's Cygnus capsule, loaded with more than 5,000 pounds of food, equipment and research, including some experiments to study flames in space and the robotic toy ball Sphero, part of an educational effort. The Cygnus — named after the swan constellation — will have to hang around in orbit until Sunday before delivering the goods. That's because three astronauts are awaiting launch from Kazakhstan on Wednesday, which would get them to the space station on Friday. NASA wants the new crew to settle in before the Cygnus pulls up. This will be the sixth Cygnus to arrive at the orbiting outpost since 2013. While the Antares was being redesigned, Orbital ATK made good on two deliveries using another company's rockets flying from Cape Canaveral. NASA's other commercial shipper, SpaceX, has made nine station deliveries since 2012, but is currently grounded, pending an investigation into last month's rocket explosion during prelaunch testing at Cape Canaveral. Given the riskiness of space flight, Culbertson and other Orbital ATK officials expressed nervousness before the launch, but said they had full confidence in the rocket. Although it took longer to resume flights at Wallops than expected, he noted, "it was done right, and that was the most important thing." NASA has been relying on Orbital ATK and SpaceX to keep the space station stocked ever since the shuttles retired in 2011. Next up will be private flights for the station crews, as the space agency works on getting astronauts to Mars in the 2030s. SpaceX and Boeing are building capsules to carry U.S. astronauts to the 250-mile-high station; those launches are expected in the next couple of years. Until then, NASA will keep flying its astronauts on Russia's Soyuz spacecraft. The space station is currently home to an American, a Russian and a third astronaut from Japan. They will be joined by an American and two Russians. Orbital ATK weathered brief hurricane delays over the past 1½ weeks, then a bad cable at the pad on Sunday bumped the launch by a day. ___ Online: Orbital ATK: http://www.orbitalatk.com/ NASA: http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/main/index.html The Orbital ATK Antares rocket lifts off from the the NASA Wallops Island flight facility in Wallops Island, Va., Monday, Oct. 17, 2016.

By Marcia Dunn / Associated Press CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. — One of NASA’s main delivery companies made a triumphant comeback seen up and down the East Coast on Monday night, launching its first space station shipment from Virginia since a rocket explosion two years ago. It was the first flight of Orbital ATK’s unmanned Antares rocket since the Oct. 28, 2014, blast that wrecked the pad and destroyed everything on the space station supply run. The setback had touched off a wave of concern about the company and NASA, which relies on the commercial sector to fly cargo to the station. For Antares’ long-awaited return, the pad underwent a $15 million restoration, and the rocket got new Russian engines to replace the vintage ones from a half-century earlier. As the Antares streaked through the night sky from NASA’s Wallops Flight Facility, it appeared as though all the work had paid off. Launch controllers applauded when the supply ship reached orbit and victory was declared. The launch provided a show for sky gazers along much of the East Coast. Reports poured in via Twitter from observers in Washington, Baltimore, Philadelphia and New York, even Central Pennsylvania and Raleigh, N.C. Getting a lift from the Antares was Orbital ATK’s Cygnus capsule, loaded with more than 5,000 pounds of food, equipment and research, including some experiments to study flames in space and the robotic toy ball Sphero, part of an educational effort. Before the launch, Amanda Davis, of Orbital ATK, said that preparation had been going smoothly: “Everyone is feeling really good about today.” The Antares’ new engines are designed to give the rocket more reliability and performance, she said. Swapping out rocket engine sis no small feat. But they “checked out great” during testing, she said. The company has also upgraded its Cygnus spacecraft to be able to carry more cargo to the station. The Cygnus — named after the swan constellation — will have to hang around in orbit until Sunday before delivering the goods. That’s because three astronauts are awaiting launch from Kazakhstan on Wednesday, which would get them to the space station Friday. NASA wants the new crew to settle in before the Cygnus pulls up. This will be the sixth Cygnus to arrive at the orbiting outpost since 2013. While the Antares was being redesigned, Orbital ATK made good on two deliveries using another company’s rockets flying from Cape Canaveral. NASA’s other commercial shipper, SpaceX, has made nine station deliveries since 2012, but is currently grounded, pending an investigation into last month’s rocket explosion during prelaunch testing at Cape Canaveral. Given the riskiness of space flight, Orbital ATK officials expressed nervousness before the launch, but said they had full confidence in the rocket. NASA has been relying on Orbital ATK and SpaceX to keep the space station stocked ever since the shuttles retired in 2011. Next up will be private flights for the station crews, as the space agency works on getting astronauts to Mars in the 2030s. SpaceX and Boeing are building capsules to carry U.S. astronauts to the 250-mile-high station; those launches are expected in the next couple of years. Until then, NASA will keep flying its astronauts on Russia’s Soyuz spacecraft. The space station is currently home to an American, a Russian and a third astronaut from Japan. They will be joined by an American and two Russians. Orbital ATK weathered brief hurricane delays over the past 1½ weeks, then a bad cable at the pad on Sunday bumped the launch by a day. Amid the triumph Monday, however, there was some concern after NASA days earlier announced that its Juno spacecraft’s engines seem to be on the fritz as it orbits Jupiter. It’s not as if Juno is in grave danger, but scientists have opted to delay the next phase of the spacecraft’s mission until they can fully investigate the problem. The Washington Post contributed.

Published on October 17, 2016 at 10:32 pm Last update on October 17, 2016 at 10:33 pm By Sam Groves Let’s say you backup your computer to an external hard drive. Your computer works fine — better than fine, actually. Let’s say it’s the best computer in the world. But there’s a tiny chance that, for whatever reason, some or all of the data on that computer could be lost. Even if that doesn’t come to pass, your computer doesn’t have infinite storage space. Having a repository for excess data would be convenient, if nothing else. Over seven billion people live on Earth. That number is expected to exceed eleven billion by 2100. Our planet is supporting a growing population with a shrinking number of natural resources. Meanwhile, at present rates of global climate change, the next century will see a rise in temperature of somewhere between 2.5 and 10 degrees Fahrenheit. In many parts of the world, this will precede rising sea levels, more powerful storms, droughts, heat waves, crop failures as well as greater poverty and famine. The relatively stable climate Earth has enjoyed over the last ten thousand years may not survive the next hundred years. Anyway, out of an abundance of caution and a desire for convenience, you go to the store to buy this hard drive. By coincidence, there’s only one left in stock. It doesn’t come cheap, but it’s a prudent investment, and you’re glad you got to it before someone else did. Last week, President Obama declared in an op-ed for CNN that the United States would send humans to Mars by the 2030s “with the ultimate ambition to one day remain there for an extended time.” He highlighted the role that the commercial space industry would play in this effort. Two weeks before that, SpaceX CEO Elon Musk said he wants to send people to Mars by 2022 and build a city-sized colony of as many as one million people there in the next 40 to 100 years. The CEO of Boeing said he would beat Musk to it. The goal, in short, is to make human beings an interplanetary species. The commercial space industry will play an essential role in that process. But we have to make sure they don’t own Mars, and that means confronting the question of who, if anyone, can own the Red Planet, and more broadly, who can own outer space. The SPACE Act of 2015 allows US citizens to explore and exploit resources on celestial bodies, providing a framework for private property in outer space. But according to the Outer Space Treaty, effective since 1967, “outer space, including the Moon and other celestial bodies, is not subject to national appropriation by claim of sovereignty, by means of use or occupation, or by any other means.” The SPACE Act insists that allowing Americans to claim private property does not amount to a claim of sovereignty. But it’s not clear. We didn’t buy Mars like you buy a hard drive. But having purchased this hard drive, you would be troubled to learn that you didn’t own it and didn’t have a right to the storage space it provides. Should a day come when Mars can support human life, every human being should have a right to live there, just as we all have the right to live on Earth and just as you have a right to that hard drive. After all, Earth may be the most hospitable planet for life in our galaxy today. But things could go wrong, and someday we all might need our next-door neighbor.

(AP) — One of NASA's main delivery companies made a triumphant comeback seen up and down the East Coast on Monday night, launching its first space station shipment from Virginia since a rocket explosion two years ago. It was the first flight of Orbital ATK's unmanned Antares rocket since the Oct. 28, 2014, blast that wrecked the pad and destroyed everything on the space station supply run. The launch provided a show for sky gazers along much of the East Coast. Reports poured in via Twitter from observers in Washington, Baltimore, Philadelphia, New York, and even Raleigh, North Carolina. For Antares' long-awaited return, the pad underwent a $15 million restoration, and the rocket got new Russian engines to replace the vintage ones from a half-century earlier. As the Antares streaked through the night sky from NASA's Wallops Flight Facility, it appeared as though all the work had paid off. Launch controllers applauded when the supply ship reached orbit and victory was declared. "It is great to be back," said Frank Culbertson, president of Orbital ATK's space systems group. NASA Administrator Charles Bolden described the launch as "magnificent" and personally thanked the Orbital ATK team. "It's been a very difficult two years, and I can't imagine what those of you in the Orbital team went through. I can't imagine how long you were holding your breath tonight," Bolden told the launch control crowd. "But you know, we made it and that's what's all important." Getting a lift from the Antares was Orbital ATK's Cygnus capsule, loaded with more than 5,000 pounds of food, equipment and research, including some experiments to study flames in space and the robotic toy ball Sphero, part of an educational effort. The Cygnus — named after the swan constellation — will have to hang around in orbit until Sunday before delivering the goods. That's because three astronauts are awaiting launch from Kazakhstan on Wednesday, which would get them to the space station on Friday. NASA wants the new crew to settle in before the Cygnus pulls up. This will be the sixth Cygnus to arrive at the orbiting outpost since 2013. While the Antares was being redesigned, Orbital ATK made good on two deliveries using another company's rockets flying from Cape Canaveral. NASA's other commercial shipper, SpaceX, has made nine station deliveries since 2012, but is currently grounded, pending an investigation into last month's rocket explosion during prelaunch testing at Cape Canaveral. Given the riskiness of space flight, Culbertson and other Orbital ATK officials expressed nervousness before the launch, but said they had full confidence in the rocket. Although it took longer to resume flights at Wallops than expected, he noted, "it was done right, and that was the most important thing." NASA has been relying on Orbital ATK and SpaceX to keep the space station stocked ever since the shuttles retired in 2011. Next up will be private flights for the station crews, as the space agency works on getting astronauts to Mars in the 2030s. SpaceX and Boeing are building capsules to carry U.S. astronauts to the 250-mile-high station; those launches are expected in the next couple of years. Until then, NASA will keep flying its astronauts on Russia's Soyuz spacecraft. The space station is currently home to an American, a Russian and a third astronaut from Japan. They will be joined by an American and two Russians. Orbital ATK weathered brief hurricane delays over the past 1½ weeks, then a bad cable at the pad on Sunday bumped the launch by a day. ___ Online: Orbital ATK: http://www.orbitalatk.com/ NASA: http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/main/index.html Tags Science Space Launches Accidents Accidents And Disasters General News Transportation Space Exploration Aerospace And Defense Industry Industrial Products And Services Business Locations Virginia Florida United States North America Raleigh Russia North Carolina Eastern Europe Europe We have recently upgraded our commenting system.

The 14-story-tall rocket, powered by a pair of new Russian-made engines, lifted off from Wallops Island, Virginia, at 7:45 p.m. EDT (2340 GMT), a NASA TV broadcast showed. Launch was delayed five minutes to give the team extra time to review their checklists, Orbital President Frank Culbertson told reporters. "It’s such a feeling of elation to see the vehicle take off. ... I’m very happy to see Antares back," said Amanda Davis, Orbital’s director of program engineering. The rocket carried a Cygnus capsule loaded with 5,290 pounds (2,400 kg) of food, supplies, equipment and science experiments for the space station, a $100-billion laboratory in orbit about 250 miles (400 km) above Earth. The capsule is expected to reach the station on Sunday after lingering several days in orbit to allow time for a Russian Soyuz capsule carrying three new crew members to reach the outpost on Friday. The Soyuz is slated to launch Wednesday from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan. The last Antares launch, on Oct. 28, 2014, ended in disaster a few seconds after liftoff due to a problem with the booster’s refurbished, Soviet-era engines. After the accident, Orbital sped up plans to replace the motors. During the downtime, Orbital bought rides for two Cygnus cargo ships aboard Atlas rockets, built and flown by United Launch Alliance, a partnership of Lockheed Martin Corp and Boeing Co. Orbital conducted a 30-second engine test firing of the Antares at the Virginia launch pad on May 31, but had never flown the refurbished rocket before Monday. The mission became more crucial for the U.S. space agency after a Sept. 1 accident destroyed a Falcon 9 rocket operated by Elon Musk’s SpaceX and a $200 million Israeli communications satellite. The accident, which occurred while the rocket was being fueled for a routine prelaunch test, has temporarily grounded SpaceX, the only company apart from Orbital currently contracted by NASA to fly cargo to the space station. Private contractors for the cargo runs became necessary following the retirement of the space shuttles in 2011. With SpaceX sidelined, NASA said it added extra food, clothing, laptop computers and spacesuit parts to the Cygnus cargo list.

It was the first flight of Orbital ATK's unmanned Antares rocket since the Oct. 28, 2014, blast that wrecked the pad and destroyed everything on the space station supply run. The launch provided a show for sky gazers along much of the East Coast. Reports poured in via Twitter from observers in Washington, Baltimore, Philadelphia, New York, and even Raleigh, North Carolina. For Antares' long-awaited return, the pad underwent a $15 million restoration, and the rocket got new Russian engines to replace the vintage ones from a half-century earlier. As the Antares streaked through the night sky from NASA's Wallops Flight Facility, it appeared as though all the work had paid off. Launch controllers applauded when the supply ship reached orbit and victory was declared. "It is great to be back," said Frank Culbertson, president of Orbital ATK's space systems group. NASA Administrator Charles Bolden described the launch as "magnificent" and personally thanked the Orbital ATK team. "It's been a very difficult two years, and I can't imagine what those of you in the Orbital team went through. I can't imagine how long you were holding your breath tonight," Bolden told the launch control crowd. "But you know, we made it and that's what's all important." Getting a lift from the Antares was Orbital ATK's Cygnus capsule, loaded with more than 5,000 pounds of food, equipment and research, including some experiments to study flames in space and the robotic toy ball Sphero, part of an educational effort. The Cygnus — named after the swan constellation — will have to hang around in orbit until Sunday before delivering the goods. That's because three astronauts are awaiting launch from Kazakhstan on Wednesday, which would get them to the space station on Friday. NASA wants the new crew to settle in before the Cygnus pulls up. This will be the sixth Cygnus to arrive at the orbiting outpost since 2013. While the Antares was being redesigned, Orbital ATK made good on two deliveries using another company's rockets flying from Cape Canaveral. NASA's other commercial shipper, SpaceX, has made nine station deliveries since 2012, but is currently grounded, pending an investigation into last month's rocket explosion during prelaunch testing at Cape Canaveral. Given the riskiness of space flight, Culbertson and other Orbital ATK officials expressed nervousness before the launch, but said they had full confidence in the rocket. Although it took longer to resume flights at Wallops than expected, he noted, "it was done right, and that was the most important thing." NASA has been relying on Orbital ATK and SpaceX to keep the space station stocked ever since the shuttles retired in 2011. Next up will be private flights for the station crews, as the space agency works on getting astronauts to Mars in the 2030s. SpaceX and Boeing are building capsules to carry U.S. astronauts to the 250-mile-high station; those launches are expected in the next couple of years. Until then, NASA will keep flying its astronauts on Russia's Soyuz spacecraft. The space station is currently home to an American, a Russian and a third astronaut from Japan. They will be joined by an American and two Russians. Orbital ATK weathered brief hurricane delays over the past 1½ weeks, then a bad cable at the pad on Sunday bumped the launch by a day. ___ Online: Orbital ATK: http://www.orbitalatk.com/ NASA: http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/main/index.html Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

The 14-story-tall rocket, powered by a pair of new Russian-made engines, lifted off from Wallops Island, Virginia, at 7:45 p.m. EDT (2340 GMT), a NASA TV broadcast showed. Launch was delayed five minutes to give the team extra time to review their checklists, Orbital President Frank Culbertson told reporters. "It's such a feeling of elation to see the vehicle take off. ... I'm very happy to see Antares back," said Amanda Davis, Orbital's director of program engineering. The rocket carried a Cygnus capsule loaded with 5,290 pounds (2,400 kg) of food, supplies, equipment and science experiments for the space station, a $100-billion laboratory in orbit about 250 miles (400 km) above Earth. The capsule is expected to reach the station on Sunday after lingering several days in orbit to allow time for a Russian Soyuz capsule carrying three new crew members to reach the outpost on Friday. The Soyuz is slated to launch Wednesday from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan. The last Antares launch, on Oct. 28, 2014, ended in disaster a few seconds after liftoff due to a problem with the booster's refurbished, Soviet-era engines. After the accident, Orbital sped up plans to replace the motors. During the downtime, Orbital bought rides for two Cygnus cargo ships aboard Atlas rockets, built and flown by United Launch Alliance, a partnership of Lockheed Martin Corp and Boeing Co. Orbital conducted a 30-second engine test firing of the Antares at the Virginia launch pad on May 31, but had never flown the refurbished rocket before Monday. The mission became more crucial for the U.S. space agency after a Sept. 1 accident destroyed a Falcon 9 rocket operated by Elon Musk's SpaceX and a $200 million Israeli communications satellite. The accident, which occurred while the rocket was being fueled for a routine prelaunch test, has temporarily grounded SpaceX, the only company apart from Orbital currently contracted by NASA to fly cargo to the space station. Private contractors for the cargo runs became necessary following the retirement of the space shuttles in 2011. With SpaceX sidelined, NASA said it added extra food, clothing, laptop computers and spacesuit parts to the Cygnus cargo list.

The orders, which are effective immediately in Canada and at noon EDT October 15 in the U.S., say the phones may not be carried on board or packed in checked bags on flights to and from Canada and the United States or within either country. The phones also can’t be shipped as air cargo. Passengers with the phones will not be allowed to board planes. And those who try to evade the U.S. ban by packing the phones in checked luggage may be subject to criminal prosecution in addition to fines. Transport officials in both countries warned that carrying the phones in checked luggage increases the potential danger to the flight. Samsung has recalled more than 2.5 million of the smartphones, citing a battery manufacturing error. The South Korean company discontinued the product earlier this week, less than two months after its August release. The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission says there have been nearly 100 reports of batteries in Note 7 phones overheating in the United States. One fire erupted on a Southwest Airlines flight earlier this month. In another case, a family in St. Petersburg, Florida, reported a Galaxy Note 7 phone left charging in their Jeep caught fire, destroying the vehicle. Transport Canada and the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration had previously warned passengers not to pack the phones in their checked bags and to power them off and not charge them while on board planes. “We recognize that banning these phones from airlines will inconvenience some passengers, but the safety of all those aboard an aircraft must take priority,” said U.S. Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx. “We are taking this additional step because even one fire incident inflight poses a high risk of severe personal injury and puts many lives at risk.” Samsung said in a statement that it is working with the department to make customers aware of the ban. The company also urged Note 7 customers to get a refund or exchange their phones by visiting their wireless carrier or retail store. Samsung has a website at http://www.samsung.com/us/note7recall/ and a phone number, 1-844-365-6197, for customers with questions. The Note 7 isn’t the only gadget to catch fire thanks to lithium-battery problems, which have afflicted everything from laptops to Tesla cars to Boeing’s 787 jetliner. At least three U.S. airlines are adding new fire-suppression equipment to fleets in case a cellphone or laptop battery overheats, catches on fire and can’t be extinguished. Rechargeable lithium batteries are more susceptible to overheating than other types of batteries if they are exposed to high temperatures, are damaged or have manufacturing flaws. Once overheating starts, it can lead to “thermal runaway” in which temperatures continue escalating to very high levels. Water can extinguish the flames, but doesn’t always halt the thermal runaway. Flames will often reappear after initially being quenched. Lithium batteries are ubiquitous in consumer electronic devices. Manufacturers like them because they weigh less and pack considerably more energy into the same space than other types of batteries. Earlier this year, the International Civil Aviation Organization, a U.N. agency that sets global aviation safety standards, banned bulk shipments of rechargeable lithium-ion batteries as cargo on passenger planes until better packaging can be developed to prevent a fire from spreading and potentially destroying the plane.

CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. Orbital ATK Inc plans to launch a revamped Antares rocket on a mission to supply the International Space Station on Monday, returning to flight for the first time since an older version of the booster exploded during liftoff two years ago.The Antares, now outfitted with a pair of Russian-made engines, is scheduled to blast off at 7:40 p.m. EDT (2340 GMT) from a repaired launch pad on Wallops Island, Virginia.Perched on top of the rocket is a Cygnus cargo ship loaded with 5,290 pounds (2,400 kg) of food, supplies, equipment and science experiments for the space station, a $100 billion laboratory in orbit about 250 miles (400 km) above Earth.“We’ve missed these guys," Joel Montalbano, NASA's deputy station manager, told reporters during a prelaunch press conference on Saturday, referring to the Antares team.The mission became more crucial for the U.S. space agency after a Sept. 1 accident destroyed a Falcon 9 rocket operated by Elon Musk’s SpaceX and a $200 million Israeli communications satellite. The accident, which occurred while the rocket was being fueled for a routine prelaunch test, has temporarily grounded SpaceX, the only company apart from Orbital currently contracted by NASA to fly cargo to the space station.Private contractors for the cargo runs became necessary following the retirement of the space shuttles in 2011.With SpaceX sidelined, NASA added extra food, clothing, laptop computers and spacesuit parts to the Cygnus cargo list, Montalbano said. The last launch of an Antares rocket, on Oct. 28, 2014, ended in disaster a few seconds after liftoff. After the accident, Orbital sped up plans to replace the rocket’s Soviet-era engines with the new Russian-made motors.During the downtime, Orbital bought rides for two Cygnus cargo ships aboard Atlas rockets, built and flown by United Launch Alliance, a partnership of Lockheed Martin Corp and Boeing Co.Orbital conducted a 30-second engine test firing of the Antares at the Virginia launch pad on May 31. “We’re always nervous, but we wouldn’t have a rocket out there if we weren’t confident we were ready to go,” Orbital vice president Mike Pinkston told reporters on Saturday.Orbital is counting on a smooth Antares launch to help attract other customers for the rocket besides NASA. The booster, designed to put up to about 17,000 pounds (8,000 kg) into orbit close to Earth, flew four times successfully before the 2014 failure.

Subscribe Information that drives Canadian industry News Features Insights Technology Centre Events Plant Expo Upcoming Events More Digital Edition Plant West E-newsletter Salary Calculator Contacts Advertise US, Canada ban Samsung Galaxy Note 7 from airliners Those who try to evade the US ban by packing the phones in checked luggage may be subject to criminal prosecution and fines October 17, 2016 by CP Staff Topics General Industries Electronics Manufacturing Tags Galaxy Note 7 manufacturing Samsung Samsung Galaxy Note 7 smartphones Transport Canada US Department of Transportation WASHINGTON — Passengers and flight crews will be banned from bringing Samsung Galaxy Note 7 smartphones on airline flights under emergency orders issued Oct. 14 by both Transport Canada and the US Department of Transportation in response to reports of the phones catching fire. The orders say the phones may not be carried on board or packed in checked bags on flights to and from Canada and the United States or within either country. The phones also can’t be shipped as air cargo. Passengers with the phones will not be allowed to board planes. And those who try to evade the US ban by packing the phones in checked luggage may be subject to criminal prosecution in addition to fines. Transport officials in both countries warned that carrying the phones in checked luggage increases the potential danger to the flight. Samsung has recalled more than 2.5 million of the smartphones, citing a battery manufacturing error. The South Korean company discontinued the product earlier this week, less than two months after its August release. The US Consumer Product Safety Commission says there have been nearly 100 reports of batteries in Note 7 phones overheating in the US. One fire erupted on a Southwest Airlines flight earlier this month. In another case, a family in St. Petersburg, Florida, reported a Galaxy Note 7 phone left charging in their Jeep caught fire, destroying the vehicle. Transport Canada and the US Federal Aviation Administration had previously warned passengers not to pack the phones in their checked bags and to power them off and not charge them while on board planes. “We recognize that banning these phones from airlines will inconvenience some passengers, but the safety of all those aboard an aircraft must take priority,” said US Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx. “We are taking this additional step because even one fire incident inflight poses a high risk of severe personal injury and puts many lives at risk.” The Note 7 isn’t the only gadget to catch fire thanks to lithium-battery problems, which have afflicted everything from laptops to Tesla cars to Boeing’s 787 jetliner. At least three US airlines are adding new fire-suppression equipment to fleets in case a cellphone or laptop battery overheats, catches on fire and can’t be extinguished. Rechargeable lithium batteries are more susceptible to overheating than other types of batteries if they are exposed to high temperatures, are damaged or have manufacturing flaws. Once overheating starts, it can lead to “thermal runaway” in which temperatures continue escalating to very high levels. Water can extinguish the flames, but doesn’t always halt the thermal runaway. Flames will often reappear after initially being quenched. Lithium batteries are ubiquitous in consumer electronic devices. Manufacturers like them because they weigh less and pack considerably more energy into the same space than other types of batteries. Earlier this year, the International Civil Aviation Organization, a UN agency that sets global aviation safety standards, banned bulk shipments of rechargeable lithium-ion batteries as cargo on passenger planes until better packaging can be developed to prevent a fire from spreading and potentially destroying the plane.

SAN FRANCISCO, October 17, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- The globalflight simulators marketis expected to reach USD 5.62 billion by 2024, according to a new report by Grand View Research, Inc.

The industry is expected to witness moderate growth over the forecast period owing to the aforementioned factors. (Logo: http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20150105/723757 ) The need to effectively replicate real flying training with the usage of motion and visual systems has resulted in the introduction of sophisticated simulators in the market. Increase in government spending and growing security concerns particularly in the military sector is anticipated to escalate product demand significantly. The rising concerns over pilot training cost along with fluctuating fuel prices may further drive demand for flight simulators over the next eight years. Browse full research report with TOC on "Flight Simulator Market Analysis By Product (Full Flight Simulator (FFS), Fixed Flight Training Devices (FTD)), By Application (Military & Defense, Civil), By Service And Segment Forecasts To 2024" at: http://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/the-global-flight-simulator-market Further key findings from the report suggest: The FFS product segment accounted for over 90% of the overall revenue in 2015 and is expected to grow at a CAGR of over 4% from 2016 to 2024. This growth is owing to features that provide motion, sound, visuals, and all other aircraft operations that create a realistic flight training environment. The demand in civil application segment is primarily due to the rising air traffic coupled with the growing emphasis on the passenger as well as pilot safety. Governments in several countries have enforced strict regulations regarding the use and significance of simulation training. The services segment is anticipated to grow at a CAGR exceeding 3.0% over the forecast period. This is primarily attributed to the rise in number of simulator installation by international airways. Europe accounted for more than 30% of the overall market share in 2015 and is expected to exhibit a modest growth over the next eight years on account of the elevating enforcement of regulations pertaining to pilot training and passenger safety. The Asia Pacific flight simulators market is estimated to exhibit a substantial growth over the forecast period in light of the growing aviation industry, resulting in the increasing demand for flight simulators. The Middle East & Africa is also projected to showcase a substantial demand of over 4%, which is primarily be attributed to the presence of carriers including Emirates, Etihad Airways, and Qatar that are investing heavily in this industry. Prominent industry players include CAE, Boeing, L-3 Link Simulation & Training, Lockheed Martin, Rockwell Collins, Thales and SaaB. Industry participants emphasize on joint ventures, mergers and acquisitions in order to acquire greater financial, technical, marketing, manufacturing and distribution expertise.

Qatar Airways Group Chief Executive, His Excellency Mr. Akbar Al Baker, said: “We are honoured to be recognised as the best carrier in the Middle East at the 2016 Aviation Business Awards.

Business News Home > Business > Business News < Back to SMG 45 Monday, 17 October 2016 | MYT 3:11 PM China aluminium makers to target auto, aerospace in global push MELBOURNE: China's giant aluminium makers are pushing into the global automotive and aerospace markets, with industry sources expecting their presence to heat up competition and possibly spark a buying spree for Western metals companies. China's top aluminium companies are venturing into the more lucrative parts of the global value chain, on course to seize market share from the likes of Alcoa and Constellium, as they look to buy into foreign firms to boost their technical know-how and expand their reach. The chief executive of Novelis Inc, the world's largest maker of rolled aluminium products, said last week he expected competition with Chinese producers to be "very fierce" over the next five to 10 years in the high-value-added sectors of aerospace and engineering - which so far have been dominated by European and US manufacturers. "Certainly (Chinese aluminium makers) will be able to produce high quality products as well," Steve Fisher told the Reuters Commodity Summit in Seoul. Zhongwang USA LLC, backed by Chinese aluminium magnate Liu Zhongtian, said in late August it would buy high precision aluminium product maker Aleris Corp in a deal worth US$2.3 billion, marking the biggest entry by a Chinese company into the US aluminium industry. The deal for Aleris, a supplier to the US defence industry, has yet to be approved by US regulators. "If Aleris is acquired by the Chinese, it would be logical to think that there would be more competition within the higher value-added sectors such as aerospace and automotive. That's where the better margins are," said analyst Robin Bhar of Societe Generale in London. "(But) Aleris is quite a significant supplier to the US military, so it's by no means a done deal."  Shares in Amsterdam-headquartered aluminium product maker Constellium jumped after the announcement, reflecting bets that it could be next. Constellium did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment. "There will be more announcements of purchases by Chinese companies of foreign firms in the next 18 months and continued consolidation globally," said Charlie Durant of consultancy CRU in London. "It will enable Chinese producers to better utilise their equipment in China, as well as obviously getting the access to markets around the world."  Alcoa is spinning out its precision manufacturing business into a company to be named Arconic, which industry sources said could be another potential target. Arconic expects to grow its automotive sheet revenue around sixfold, to US$1.3 billion in 2018 from US$229 million in 2013. It has already signed US$10 billion with customers including Boeing and Airbus. An Alcoa spokesperson declined to comment. "Zhongwang have been openly pursuing a downstream focus for years, but they aren't the only ones with capital, a healthy balance sheet and an appetite to expand downstream," said Paul Adkins, managing director of Beijing-based consultancy AZ China. Adkins pointed to China's Hongqaio Group and Shandong Nanshan Aluminium as potential bidders. Hongqaio Group declined to comment. Nanshan's board secretary said the company hasn't received any information about possible mergers from the board. Shandong Nanshan said in July it aims to tap growth in new energy vehicles to become a top automotive and a major aerospace materials supplier as it strives to meet international certification standards. - Reuters Tags / Keywords: Corporate News You May Be Interested Indian banks receive US$30bil in deposits Malaysian palm oil/Vegoils: Market factors to watch Monday Nov 14 'Trump Thump' whacks bond market for $1 trillion loss Where are you on the journey to financial freedom?

REUTERS/Soe Zeya Tun Hello! Here's what you need to know on Monday. 1. US Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and his surrogates are openly predicting the election will be "rigged," as part of a coordinated effort against him among national media outlets, the political establishment, and Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. 2. Iraq just began what could be "the most complex and largest" anti-ISIS operation ever. The liberation of Mosul has been the linchpin of the US's plan to defeat ISIS in Iraq. 3. The US and Britain have called for an immediate and unconditional ceasefire in Yemen, to end violence between Iran-backed Houthis and the government. 4. Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump issued two contrasting responses to the vandalizing and apparent firebombing of a Republican Party headquarters in North Carolina. Local police have not identified any suspects, and only said that the investigation is still ongoing. 5. At least 30 people were killed in Pakistan when two buses collided in southern Punjab province. Images from the crash site showed a bus on its side with its windows shattered, and another bus with its roof partly caved in. 6. PepsiCo has set a target for reducing the amount of sugar in its soft drinks around the world, and will announce that by 2025 at least two thirds of its drinks will have 100 calories or fewer from added sugar per 12 oz serving. 7. Airbus aims to overtake arch rival Boeing in terms of annual plane deliveries by 2020, having fallen behind in recent years, CEO Fabrice Bregier said in a German newspaper interview. 8. At least 25 inmates died in clashes between two rival factions in a prison in far northern Brazil. Among the dead, seven people were beheaded and six burned to death. 9. The United Nations is concerned at the rise in looting and attacks targeting emergency aid deliveries in hurricane-ravaged Haiti. Food, medicine, and other essential aid has been slow to reach many hard-hit areas. 10. Thailand's controversial king-to-be faces the challenge of gaining his country's respect. The late king had chosen his son, Crown Prince Maha Vajiralongkorn, to succeed him. And finally ... Schools around the US are finally pushing back their start times — and it's working.

Weather Your 4-day local weather forecast Monday November 14, 2016 Life & Style Travel Larger / SmallerNight Mode Airbus A350-900 is the 10,000th Airbus: New plane delivered to Singapore Airlines Craig Platt 17 Oct 2016, 4:39 p.m. Brand new Airbus A350, the 10,000th Airbus plane, rolls off the assembly line. Airbus A350-900 is the 10,000th Airbus: New plane delivered to Singapore Airlines The 10,000th Airbus, an A350-900, has been delivered to Singapore Airlines. Photo: Airbus The "10,000th" logo on the Singapore Airlines Airbus A350-900. Tweet Facebook of ╳ exit Airbus celebrated the delivery of its 10,000 aircraft on Friday, with Singapore Airlines receiving a new A350-900 at a special ceremony. The aircraft is the sixth A350 delivered to Singapore Airlines, which has ordered a total of 67 of the cutting-edge new planes. Emblazoned with a special "10,000th Airbus" logo, the plane will be used to launch the airline's new Singapore to San Francisco direct route later this month. The long-haul route's flying time will vary between 14 hours and 35 minutes, and an epic 17 hours and 45 minutes, depending on direction and winds. That will be the airline's longest route until it receives a new variant of the A350-900, the A350-900ULR (Ultra Long Range), which will allow it to resume direct flights from Singapore to New York. Once that occurs, Singapore Airlines will regain the title for the world's longest flight route. Emirates currently flies the world's longest route – Dubai to Auckland direct. The ULR version of the A350 will be able to fly for up to 19 hours non-stop. Singapore Airlines placed its first order with Airbus in 1979 and became the launch customer for the world's largest passenger aircraft, the A380 super jumbo, in 2005. The first route for that plane was from Singapore to Sydney. Despite initial success, demand for the A380 has waned in recent years as airlines move on to new aircraft made of lightweight materials that deliver savings on fuel, such as the Boeing 787 Dreamliner and the A350. The A350 uses a combination of materials, including plastic reinforced by carbon fibre, along with titanium and aluminium alloys. More than 70 per cent of the aircraft is made of lightweight materials. The first ever Airbus plane, the A300B2, was delivered to Air France in 1974. In the 1980s the company launched the hugely successful A320, its first single-aisle plane. Airbus is reportedly on track to deliver 650 aircraft this year but has a backlog of 6700 on order – a number it says it will take 10 years to deliver at current production rates.

China’s top aluminium companies are venturing into the more lucrative parts of the global value chain, on course to seize market share from the likes of Alcoa and Constellium , as they look to buy into foreign firms to boost their technical know-how and expand their reach. The chief executive of Novelis Inc, the world’s largest maker of rolled aluminium products, said last week he expected competition with Chinese producers to be “very fierce” over the next five to 10 years in the high-value-added sectors of aerospace and engineering – which so far have been dominated by European and U.S. manufacturers. “Certainly (Chinese aluminium makers) will be able to produce high quality products as well,” Steve Fisher told the Reuters Commodity Summit in Seoul. Zhongwang USA LLC, backed by Chinese aluminium magnate Liu Zhongtian, said in late August it would buy high precision aluminium product maker Aleris Corp in a deal worth $2.3 billion, marking the biggest entry by a Chinese company into the U.S. aluminium industry. The deal for Aleris, a supplier to the U.S. defence industry, has yet to be approved by U.S. regulators. “If Aleris is acquired by the Chinese, it would be logical to think that there would be more competition within the higher value-added sectors such as aerospace and automotive. That’s where the better margins are,” said analyst Robin Bhar of Societe Generale in London. “(But) Aleris is quite a significant supplier to the U.S. military, so it’s by no means a done deal.” Shares of Amsterdam-headquartered aluminium product maker Constellium jumped after the announcement, reflecting bets that it could be next. Constellium did not immediately respond to an e-mailed request for comment. “There will be more announcements of purchases by Chinese companies of foreign firms in the next 18 months and continued consolidation globally,” said Charlie Durant of consultancy CRU in London. “It will enable Chinese producers to better utilize their equipment in China, as well as obviously getting the access to markets around the world.” Alcoa is spinning out its precision manufacturing business into a company to be named Arconic, which industry sources said could be another potential target. Arconic expects to grow its automotive sheet revenue around sixfold, to $1.3 billion in 2018 from $229 million in 2013. It has already signed $10 billion with customers including Boeing and Airbus. An Alcoa spokesperson declined to comment. “Zhongwang have been openly pursuing a downstream focus for years, but they aren’t the only ones with capital, a healthy balance sheet and an appetite to expand downstream,” said Paul Adkins, managing director of Beijing-based consultancy AZ China. Adkins pointed to China’s Hongqaio Group and Shandong Nanshan Aluminium as potential bidders. Hongqaio Group declined to comment. Nanshan’s board secretary said the company hasn’t received any information about possible mergers from the board. Shandong Nanshan said in July it aims to tap growth in new energy vehicles to become a top automotive and a major aerospace materials supplier as it strives to meet international certification standards.

"Following" : "Follow"}} October 18, 2016 12:18pm   Comments Share: Related These 11 Stocks Could Drop 70% 4 Out Of 7 Firms Initiate Bullish Coverage On Apptio Just 3 Weeks After Its IPO Barclays started coverage of Apptio Inc (NASDAQ: APTI) with an Equal-Weight rating and $23 price target, saying the company has attractive growth opportunities with its first mover advantage in the technology business management space. However, the valuation keeps the brokerage on the sidelines as it awaits a better entry point. Since the IPO, Apptio shares have gained 28 percent above the $16 deal pricing and are now trading at 4.0x 2017 estimated EV/Sales. Barclays said the price target of $23 represents 4.5x 2017 estimated EV/Sales, representing a 28 percent discount to its peer group average. “We believe the discount is justified given the company's growth profile. As Apptio demonstrates success increasing its customer base and accelerating revenue growth, we may have reason to consider the greater upside and adjust our target multiple as warranted,” analyst Raimo Lenschow wrote in a note. That said, the analyst is positive on the company’s fundamentals as it has delivered solid double-digit revenue growth of 21 percent. In addition, Lenschow believes the company faces limited competition and operates in an underpenetrated $6 billion total available market (TAM), which provides plenty of growth opportunities. Meanwhile, the company is poised for revenue and margin expansion with the mix increasingly shifting towards the faster growing subscription business. “With over 40% penetration of the Fortune 100, including names such as Microsoft and Boeing, Apptio demonstrates scalability and paves the way for expansion into the Global 10,000. The question remains whether it will experience comparable success with these companies as they have smaller IT budgets,” Lenschow highlighted. At time of writing, shares of Apptio were down 0.73 percent to $20.37.

(Bill Ingalls/NASA via AP) Special delivery to International Space Station lights up sky 2 years after catastrophe The Orbital ATK Antares rocket lifts off from the the NASA Wallops Island flight facility in Wallops Island, Va., Monday, Oct. 17, 2016. The rocket is carrying supplies to the International Space Station. (AP Photo/Steve Helber) By MARCIA DUNN THE ASSOCIATED PRESS CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. — One of NASA’s main delivery companies made a triumphant comeback seen up and down the East Coast on Monday night, launching its first space station shipment from Virginia since a rocket explosion two years ago. It was the first flight of Orbital ATK’s unmanned Antares rocket since the Oct. 28, 2014, blast that wrecked the pad and destroyed everything on the space station supply run. The launch provided a show for sky gazers along much of the East Coast. Reports poured in via Twitter from observers in Washington, Baltimore, Philadelphia, New York, and even Raleigh, North Carolina. For Antares’ long-awaited return, the pad underwent a $15 million restoration, and the rocket got new Russian engines to replace the vintage ones from a half-century earlier. As the Antares streaked through the night sky from NASA’s Wallops Flight Facility, it appeared as though all the work had paid off. Launch controllers applauded when the supply ship reached orbit and victory was declared. “It is great to be back,” said Frank Culbertson, president of Orbital ATK’s space systems group. NASA Administrator Charles Bolden described the launch as “magnificent” and personally thanked the Orbital ATK team. “It’s been a very difficult two years, and I can’t imagine what those of you in the Orbital team went through. I can’t imagine how long you were holding your breath tonight,” Bolden told the launch control crowd. “But you know, we made it and that’s what’s all important.” Getting a lift from the Antares was Orbital ATK’s Cygnus capsule, loaded with more than 5,000 pounds of food, equipment and research, including some experiments to study flames in space and the robotic toy ball Sphero, part of an educational effort. The Cygnus — named after the swan constellation — will have to hang around in orbit until Sunday before delivering the goods. That’s because three astronauts are awaiting launch from Kazakhstan on Wednesday, which would get them to the space station on Friday. NASA wants the new crew to settle in before the Cygnus pulls up.   This will be the sixth Cygnus to arrive at the orbiting outpost since 2013.

(AP Photo/Steve Helber) Tweet Change text size for the story Print Report an error CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. — One of NASA’s main delivery companies made a triumphant comeback seen up and down the East Coast on Monday night, launching its first space station shipment from Virginia since a rocket explosion two years ago. It was the first flight of Orbital ATK’s unmanned Antares rocket since the Oct. 28, 2014, blast that wrecked the pad and destroyed everything on the space station supply run. The launch provided a show for sky gazers along much of the East Coast. Reports poured in via Twitter from observers in Washington, Baltimore, Philadelphia, New York, and even Raleigh, North Carolina. For Antares’ long-awaited return, the pad underwent a $15 million restoration, and the rocket got new Russian engines to replace the vintage ones from a half-century earlier. As the Antares streaked through the night sky from NASA’s Wallops Flight Facility, it appeared as though all the work had paid off. Launch controllers applauded when the supply ship reached orbit and victory was declared. “It is great to be back,” said Frank Culbertson, president of Orbital ATK’s space systems group. NASA Administrator Charles Bolden described the launch as “magnificent” and personally thanked the Orbital ATK team. “It’s been a very difficult two years, and I can’t imagine what those of you in the Orbital team went through. I can’t imagine how long you were holding your breath tonight,” Bolden told the launch control crowd. “But you know, we made it and that’s what’s all important.” Getting a lift from the Antares was Orbital ATK’s Cygnus capsule, loaded with more than 5,000 pounds of food, equipment and research, including some experiments to study flames in space and the robotic toy ball Sphero, part of an educational effort. The Cygnus — named after the swan constellation — will have to hang around in orbit until Sunday before delivering the goods. That’s because three astronauts are awaiting launch from Kazakhstan on Wednesday, which would get them to the space station on Friday. NASA wants the new crew to settle in before the Cygnus pulls up. This will be the sixth Cygnus to arrive at the orbiting outpost since 2013.

By Marcia DunnThe Associated Press Mon., Oct. 17, 2016 CAPE CANAVERAL, FLA.—One of NASA’s main delivery companies launched its first space station shipment from Virginia in two years Monday night, lighting up the East Coast. It was the first flight of Orbital ATK’s unmanned Antares rocket since a launch explosion on Oct. 28, 2014, that wrecked the pad and destroyed everything on the space station supply run. For the long-awaited comeback, the pad underwent a $15 million (U.S.) restoration, and the Antares got new Russian engines to replace the vintage ones from a half-century earlier. As the Antares streaked through the night sky from NASA’s Wallops Flight Facility, it appeared as though all the work had paid off. Launch controllers applauded when the supply ship reached orbit and victory was declared. The launch provided a show for sky gazers along much of the East Coast. Reports poured in via Twitter from observers in Washington, Baltimore, Philadelphia and New York, even central Pennsylvania. The potential viewing area stretched as far south as Charleston, South Carolina, all the way up to Boston. Getting a lift from the Antares was Orbital ATK’s Cygnus capsule, loaded with more than 5,000 pounds (2,268 kilograms) of food, equipment and research, including some experiments to study flames in space and the robotic toy ball, Sphero, part of an educational effort.

Why LEGO stoppped promotions through The Daily Mail Journey to Mars ... from your couch Orbital ATK is set to launch a rocket loaded with supplies for the International Space Station, on Monday night, nearly two years after one of its Antares rockets exploded shortly after liftoff, and one day after a faulty cable caused a delay. By Lonnie Shekhtman, Staff October 17, 2016 Save for later Saved In this photo provided by NASA, the Orbital ATK Antares rocket, with the Cygnus spacecraft onboard, sits on launch Pad-0A on Sunday, at NASA's Wallops Flight Facility in Virginia. Bill Ingalls/NASA/AP View Caption About video ads View Caption of It was to be Orbital ATK’s big comeback moment, but Sunday’s highly anticipated launch of its Antares rocket, which had been grounded for two years, had an anticlimactic moment when it was canceled by a faulty cable. “ Oh, how disappointed I am!” tweeted one of the company’s followers, @GrpShawna, on Sunday. The Sterling, Va.-based aerospace and defense contractor is set to try again to launch 5,000 pounds of supplies to the astronauts working aboard the International Space Station (ISS) on Monday at 7:40 pm EDT from Virginia’s Wallops Island. Given clear skies, the launch should be visible along most of the East Coast, including Washington, New York, and Boston. Those in other parts of the country can watch a live webcast Monday night on NASA TV. Recommended: Could you pass Astronomy 101? Take the quiz! The ISS supplies are packed into Orbital’s Cygnus capsule, which will be delivered to the ISS by Antares a few days after the launch. The rocket, which has been grounded since it exploded on the launchpad within seconds of liftoff two years ago, likely will have to orbit Earth for several days before docking with the space station. Its circuitous route is meant to make room for a launch of three astronauts from Kazakhstan on Wednesday. They will join the three already aboard the orbiting space lab. Test your knowledge Could you pass Astronomy 101? Take the quiz! Photos of the Day Photos of the Weekend Orbital spent two years redesigning its rocket and rebuilding the launch pad. It replaced an old Russian-built engine with a newer one, also built by a Russian company. In the meantime, it continued delivering cargo to the ISS under a $1.9 billion contract the company had signed with NASA, using other companies’s rockets. By the time Antares was ready for launch again on Sunday, there was great anticipation from the space community. "This is a very exciting time for us at Orbital ATK," Frank Culbertson, Orbital's space systems president, said the night before Sunday’s launch. "A lot of hard work has gone into this." Orbital is one of two private companies hired by NASA to deliver cargo to the space station. The other is SpaceX, which also has faced major technical setbacks. Just last month, a test of its Falcon 9 rocket at Cape Canaveral ended in an explosion on the launch pad. SpaceX's explosion is not expected to cause major cargo-delivery delays, according to the company, which says it could resume delivery in November. SpaceX, along with Boeing, are expected to start ferrying astronauts to the space station in the next couple of years. Today only Russia can launch humans to space aboard its Soyuz rocket. As USA Today reported in 2015, it costs US taxpayers about $75 million for every ride to the space station, a sum that could rise to $82 million in 2018.

Fuller On Oct. 16, 1981, the Screaming Eagle patches came off and the Army's 101st Aviation Group was designated as the 160th Aviation Battalion. Five years later, it became the 160th Aviation Group, then the 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment (SOAR) in 1990. But, the regiment is most affectionately known as “Night Stalkers,” after the soldiers who pioneered the Army’s nighttime flying techniques. And on Oct. 21, the Night Stalkers are throwing themselves a party, according to Fort Campbell’s publication. On Friday, the 160th will host a daylong celebration for past and present SOAR soldiers and their families to celebrate 35 years in service. Events will take place at Fort Campbell, Kentucky, where SOAR headquarters are located. But there will be no usual party games present. Instead, outdoor activities include a team-building, 10-obstacle mud run course for active SOAR soldiers and a Night Stalker picnic, which will include a cook-off. There will also be bounce houses and live music. The Night Stalker version of "plank holders" and Gold Star families will be in attendance, giving distinction to those who have been there since the beginning, and those who have given the ultimate sacrifice. In the regiment’s 35 years, 94 Night Stalkers have died in training and combat. Outlined in the 160th's creed, being a Night Stalker comes with high risk for which each soldier is prepared. While SOAR headquarters, the training company, 1st Battalion and 2nd Battalion are in Kentucky, the 3rd Battalion is in Hunter Army Airfield, Georgia, and the 4th Battalion is in Fort Lewis, Washington. Each battalion comprises light, medium and heavy helicopters, customized for the units.  First Battalion has one Boeing (based on McDonnell Douglas) AH-6 Little Bird company, one McDonnell Douglas (first Hughes) MH-6 Little Bird company and three Sikorsky MH-60 Black Hawk companies. The 2nd Battalion has two Boeing MH-47 Chinook companies. Third and 4th battalions both have two Chinook companies and one Black Hawk company.

The first installment of this series examined Indianapolis. The transit expansion plan on the ballot in Seattle this November is a big one. Seattle’s “ST3” plan would add 62 miles of grade-separated light rail. Map: SoundTransit3 Known as ST3, the proposal calls for a 62-mile expansion of grade-separated light rail extending across three counties, including about four miles that will run underground in central Seattle. Also included: bus rapid transit routes along two highway corridors, and $20 million to plan transit-oriented development. The total package comes to $54 billion, which will be paid for by a mix of property taxes, sales taxes, and excise taxes. And it will take more than 20 years to complete. Sound Transit estimates that under this plan, ridership will nearly double by 2040 to 800,000 daily trips, and that 361 million miles of driving will be averted each year [PDF]. There are some downsides to the plan, which has drawn criticism for devoting too much to park-and-ride transit in car-centric areas. While expanding the transit network could create new walkable communities across the region, different suburbs have shown varying levels of commitment to transit-oriented development. ST3 calls for spending $661 million on parking at suburban stations, which works out to $80,000 per space. And much of the suburban light rail will run along highway rights-of-way, which is a bad fit for walkable development. Because ST3 is a regional measure that can’t be enacted without suburban support, some compromises were unavoidable, said Zach Shaner, staff reporter at Seattle Transit Blog. And with the price of housing rising in Seattle, he said, “We have a moral imperative to be providing fast reliable transit for people who live outside of the city.” “This is the best package that we can expect given the political realities and the players involved,” he said. “It’s not perfect, but it’s good. And it’s long past time we constructed grade-separated transit in the city.” Ridership on Seattle’s bus system has grown considerably in the last decade, making it a national success story in reducing solo car commuting. But with the region expected to grow by 800,000 residents in the next 20 years, the need to build transit that can’t get bogged down in car traffic is increasingly urgent. The highest-ridership segment will be a new light rail connection from downtown to Ballard, which is projected to draw 144,000 daily trips and triple the speed of the current “rapid ride” buses. Shaner says the investment promises to “grow our downtown northward in a really positive way.” By running high-capacity transit underground, Shaner added, street space will be freed up for purposes like protected bike lanes. These city-focused projects won’t be complete for some time, however. A light rail extension to West Seattle isn’t scheduled to open until 2030, and the Ballard line won’t open until five years after that. Large employers including Boeing, Microsoft, and Amazon all support the ST3 measure. The opposition does not seem strong in comparison, though the Seattle Times is not a fan. It’s important to understand, said Shaner, that a lot of ST3 revenue will come from extending taxes implemented for the last round of light rail investments — known as ST2. The additional annual pricetag on top of those existing taxes won’t be that large. The transit advocacy group Seattle Subway made this graphic to put it in perspective: Image: Seattle Subway Email Share Vooch how Many Miles of protected Bike Lane ? Southeasterner Bikes?!? We don’t need no stinking bikes! Ironically if you choose to drive to a ST park and ride facility it is free. If you choose to bike to a ST station and want protected parking you will pay a non-refundable registration fee (that has to be mailed in!) and a monthly access fee. Where do you think the priorities of this organization are? Raffi256 Sounds really odd to me to use light rail for all these things, especially for long-distance commuter lines to remote suburbs. It’s very slow and light rail cars aren’t designed for long trip times, it’s mostly standing room. They’re really more like a glorified streetcar or tramway, just good for short trips hop on and off. Elias You’re right about light rail in most places. And Seattle could go that route and cut the budget by tens of billions. But the light rail that Seattle is actually proposing to build is more akin to the Chicago L train or the New York subway. It’s grade-separated light rail that is light-years better than the stuck-at-lights light rail that most cities are pumping out. And that sort of high-quality infrastructure unfortunately isn’t cheap. Raffi256 What I’d expect for this is something more like Chicago’s Metra trains, seeing as how it’s primarily a regional commuter system. The L is terrifying enough over short distances, it would be unbearable on a 80 minute ride from the suburbs like what’s proposed here. Seattle already built their light rail route that very nearly reaches the airport (stops short a half mile from the terminal), and it takes longer than the express bus routes that it replaced. It averages about 25 mph. CeeTee55 Seattle would have been better off with heavy rail, but they went with light rail to make use of the downtown bus tunnel so they’re stuck with light rail now. Most of it will not interact with street traffic so it’s more akin to heavy rail in terms of operation. Raffi256 Yes but it’s also more akin to light rail in that the cars are small and aren’t equipped with the accommodations passengers expect for hour-long trips, and the performance (top speed/acceleration) isn’t great either. Remember they need to make it more attractive than what is already there, and who’s going to want to ride in from all the way out in Everett on this thing? It would take over an hour to Seattle, almost 2 hours if you’re going to the airport. Most people would be standing assuming it gets decent ridership. It’s not going to work. Marcus Gillette Hang on. Seattle already has a heavy rail solution (Sounder) which is pushing the capacity of the rail corridor to the limit. ST3 does expand Sounder service, by the way. But commuter rail doesn’t solve all of the same problems that light rail/subway does. Regarding commute times, 60 minutes from Everett to Seattle every time beats daily peak transit times of 90 minutes on busses or worse in single occupancy vehicles. BRT isn’t less expensive or more efficient when you factor in total cost of ownership. The region is crippled and has nowhere else to go but to plug into the existing transit network and right-of-ways. CeeTee55 How about a whole new tunnel for heavy rail? There is this proposal (below), though in this example the new tunnel shown is *still* light rail and the old tunnel is ‘downgraded’ to being for bus and streetcar. https://transportreview.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/2nd-tunnel3.png I agree light rail is being used for things that are “way out of scope” for it. Los Angeles is a great example. It’s going to end up with the world’s longest light rail lines and is probably going to encounter major logistical and operational issues with these. Oemissions The social costs of driving in Canada paid out by got is $200 Billion/yr For the USA it must be much more Drivers and auto corporations should have been paying for all these costs since the beginning frank discussion I hate the Seattle Subway’s misleading comparison of “apples” to “oranges.” 1. The Seattle Times is generally the same price throughout the region, a bit more for outlying areas. What is shown above is what ST calls a median price, and most of Seattle, the Eastside, and South Snohomish County will pay substantially more than that. For instance, how many own a house appraised at $360,658? A vehicle worth $5,333? Go to st3tax.com to see what your total taxes will be, without accounting for inflation or buying habits over the next 25 years, which are impossible to predict. Unfortunately, Sound Transit took over 2 months after its advisory panel recommended having a calculator to put one up, but they passed on the recommendations to: (a) provide the total ST taxes; and (b) the taxes for the duration. 2. One can opt in or opt out of a Seattle Times subscription. In contrast, ST-3 is mandatory: folks who aren’t getting much – if anything – out of ST-3 (like those in 101,500 population Renton) get to pay for it anyway, and some of the taxes go on forever, and there’s no more vote of the people. 3. One can get different levels of a Seattle Times subscription, such as weekends, Sunday only, etc. For ST-3, you’re paying for a program that mostly is for – and benefits – those living and working in Seattle. In contrast, one’s stuck with ST-3 light rail’s projects. For those living in Everett and commuting to Seattle or Bellevue, they get to wait an extra 5-7 years due to the politicians’ desire to appease their contributors at Paine Field. Then, they get to spend the equivalent of 2 weeks/year on a train due to the dogleg. Oh, and higher fares due the longer distances. 4. A single Seattle TImes subscription can be shared with many others. ST-3, with the resultant tripling of car tabs and 10%+ sales taxes, can’t be. You’re stuck. My life won’t be easier in the future with ST-3. Most likely, I will have expired by the time their light rail reaches me, maybe retired, certainly not able to afford to live in an increasingly-expensive area (which this light rail plan encourages: sprawl), for there’s nothing in it for today’s commuters. Further, light rail projected for my area doesn’t duplicate local bus service, so no new bus service, either. We’ll still have 11 bus routes, 7 on weekends, many on hourly frequencies during 8-6 spans.

Bill Ingalls/NASA/AP View Caption About video ads View Caption of It was to be Orbital ATK’s big comeback moment, but Sunday’s highly anticipated launch of its Antares rocket, which had been grounded for two years, had an anticlimactic moment when it was canceled by a faulty cable. “ Oh, how disappointed I am!” tweeted one of the company’s followers, @GrpShawna, on Sunday. The Sterling, Va.-based aerospace and defense contractor is set to try again to launch 5,000 pounds of supplies to the astronauts working aboard the International Space Station (ISS) on Monday at 7:40 pm EDT from Virginia’s Wallops Island. Given clear skies, the launch should be visible along most of the East Coast, including Washington, New York, and Boston. Those in other parts of the country can watch a live webcast Monday night on NASA TV. Recommended: Could you pass Astronomy 101? Take the quiz! The ISS supplies are packed into Orbital’s Cygnus capsule, which will be delivered to the ISS by Antares a few days after the launch. The rocket, which has been grounded since it exploded on the launchpad within seconds of liftoff two years ago, likely will have to orbit Earth for several days before docking with the space station. Its circuitous route is meant to make room for a launch of three astronauts from Kazakhstan on Wednesday. They will join the three already aboard the orbiting space lab. Test your knowledge Could you pass Astronomy 101? Take the quiz! Photos of the Day Photos of the Weekend Orbital spent two years redesigning its rocket and rebuilding the launch pad. It replaced an old Russian-built engine with a newer one, also built by a Russian company. In the meantime, it continued delivering cargo to the ISS under a $1.9 billion contract the company had signed with NASA, using other companies’s rockets. By the time Antares was ready for launch again on Sunday, there was great anticipation from the space community. "This is a very exciting time for us at Orbital ATK," Frank Culbertson, Orbital's space systems president, said the night before Sunday’s launch. "A lot of hard work has gone into this." Orbital is one of two private companies hired by NASA to deliver cargo to the space station. The other is SpaceX, which also has faced major technical setbacks. Just last month, a test of its Falcon 9 rocket at Cape Canaveral ended in an explosion on the launch pad. SpaceX's explosion is not expected to cause major cargo-delivery delays, according to the company, which says it could resume delivery in November. SpaceX, along with Boeing, are expected to start ferrying astronauts to the space station in the next couple of years. Today only Russia can launch humans to space aboard its Soyuz rocket. As USA Today reported in 2015, it costs US taxpayers about $75 million for every ride to the space station, a sum that could rise to $82 million in 2018.

The following are some of the factors that may move German stocks: DEUTSCHE BANK Indicated 0.3 percent lower Aides to German Chancellor Angela Merkel told lawmakers last week the state would not take a stake in Deutsche Bank if it were to issue new stock, the Wall Street Journal said on Friday, citing a person who attended the briefing. Deutsche Bank is studying a possible change of its strategy in the United States, two sources close to the company said on Saturday. BAYER Indicated 0.1 percent lower Bayer Crop Science CEO Liam Condon said in an interview with Die Welt on Saturday that when the company takes over U.S. seed firm Monsanto, an integration process will be implemented. "Be assured that Bayer will have a unified croporate culture," he said. COMMERZBANK Indicated 0.5 percent higher Commerzbank favours a separate listing of its ETF and derivatives unit EMC, Euro am Sonntag reported in its Saturdy edition, citing banking sources. But it was unclear whether 100 percent would be listed or a smaller share. LUFTHANSA, AIR BERLIN Lufthansa indicated 0.4 percent higher Air Berlin indicated 0.8 percent lower Air Berlin on Saturday said it has banned Samsung's Galaxy Note 7 mobile phones from its flights while rival Lufthansa said it has banned the phones on flights to and from the United States, expecting the ban to be widened later. SIEMENS, OSRAM Siemens indicated 0.3 percent lower, Osram 0.3 percent higher Siemens chief executive Joe Kaeser said in Wirtschaftswoche on Saturday that any takeover by Chinese investors of former Siemens subsidiary Osram must safeguard German jobs. VOLKSWAGEN Indicated unchanged Chief executive Matthias Mueller in an internal meeting demanded that material costs and overheads be cut by 10 percent as part of its annual budget round for 2017, trade magazine Automobilwoche wrote on Saturday in abstracts ahead of a story due to be published on Oct. 17. CONTINENTAL Indicated unchanged Continental on Saturday announced it bought Hornschuch, a supplier for the car industry, via its subsidiary Benecke-Kaliko, in order to expand its industrial business and open up new sales markets. TELEFONICA DEUTSCHLAND Indicated 0.3 percent lower Germany's network regulatory authority, the Bundesnetzagentur, is considering taking measures against Telefonica Deutschland's O2 because complaints received about ongoing server problems and unavailability of service hotlines, Tagesspiegel am Sonntag reported. A company spokeswoman was quoted by the paper as saying it was aware and about to improve the service in coming weeks. ENBW Indicated 2.4 percent lower EnBW, Germany's third largest utility group, will rely on its power transport grids to generate future earnings, having decided to remain integrated in the face of split-ups by rivals RWE and E.ON, finance chief Thomas Kusterer said in a Boersenzeitung interview on Saturday. AIRBUS Indicated down 0.3 percent European air craft maker Airbus plans to overtake United States rival Boeing on plane deliveries in 2020 again, having fallen behind in recent years, chief executive Fabrice Bregier said in an interview with Die Welt on Monday.

While the requirement wasn’t initially included in the missile’s spec, service brass have called for ship-killing capability in general terms. Furthermore, the weapon’s range will still be under 500 kilometers to comply with the Intermediate Nuclear Forces treaty. Contractor Raytheon has deemed the subtle requirement as entirely doable. Middle East & North Africa Militants from the Islamic State have used booby-trapped UAVs to attack forces fighting the jihadists in Iraq. The drone, rigged with explosives, attacked north of the IS-held city of Mosul and left two Kurdish fighters dead and two French soldiers fighting for their lives. Media reports said the drone was shot down and it only exploded when the soldiers approached it. Few units have the equipment to dispose of such threats effectively. Africa Plans are underway for Japan to increase their presence in East Africa by the expansion of their military base in Djibouti. Additional land will be leased to accommodate the expansion and there is also the possibility of Japanese C-130s joining a contingent of currently deployed P-3 surveillance aircraft. Earlier this year, Tokyo announced that $40 billion extra would be added to ongoing investments in African infrastructure, education, and healthcare projects. Meanwhile, China has pledged $60 billion in similar programs as the East Asian rivals battle for influence and resources on the continent. A number of USAF F-16s and KC-130s have been deployed to the Horn of Africa in anticipation of potential violence in South Sudan against American interests. The request was made by the US Africa Command (AFRICOM) based at Camp Lemonnier in Djibouti, the US counterterrorism hub in the region. In July, AFRICOM dispatched about 50 combat-equipped troops at the order of President Barack Obama to protect US diplomatic personnel amid widespread violence and civil unrest in South Sudan. Europe Bulgaria’s Ministry of Defense has altered the criteria of their fighter acquisition program, lessening the importance of an aircraft’s lifespan to just 5% of the evaluation. The previous weightage of 25% was seen to favor Saab’s Gripen but this advantage has now shifted to second-hand F-16s. Bulgaria had wanted to buy used F-16s from Portugal but the plan was abandoned following the collapse of the government of Boykko Borissov in 2013. Asia Pacific A recommendation has been made by Australia’s Senate committee on Foreign Affairs, Defense and Trade that its defense department implement a “hedging strategy” against any delay with the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program by 2019. While the committee stated that it had received evidence criticizing the F-35 and calls for participation to be scrapped, its members judged the F-35 as “the only aircraft able to meet Australia’s strategic needs for the foreseeable future.” The Australian Strategic Policy Institute told the committee the most sensible hedge would be procuring additional F/A-18F Super Hornets. Lockheed Martin has offered to collaborate with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI) on jointly developing a new fighter for Japan. LM President Marillyn Hewson made the disclosure saying the company will participate in a second round of Request For Information by Japan’s Ministry of Defense next year. Set to be the replacement for Tokyo’s current fleet of F-2s, other potential collaborators who have responded to the initial RFI include Boeing. Basler Turbo Conversions of the USA have offered their BT-64 gunship to the Philippines as a replacement for their Rockwell OV-10 Broncos. A twin-turboprop conversion of the Douglas DC-3 Dakota, the BT-67 has been fitted with updated systems such as digital avionics, a night-vision goggle-compatible cockpit, weather radar, and a forward-looking infrared (FLIR) sensor. Other PAF requirements filled by the aircraft include running transport, surveillance, aero medical evacuation, and maritime patrol missions.
