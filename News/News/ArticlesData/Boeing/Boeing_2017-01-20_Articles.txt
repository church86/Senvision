AutoZone operates seven stores in Hamilton County, two in Cleveland, two in Dalton, Ga., and others in Ringgold, Ga., Fort Oglethorpe, Athens, Tenn., Etowah, Tenn., and Pikeville, Tenn. The retailer said most of the new hiring will be at stores in Atlanta, Dallas, Cincinnati and Columbus, Ohio, New York City, New Orleans, Pittsburg and Oakland, Calif. AutoZone is the latest U.S. business to tout its hiring plans as Donald Trump becomes president. Trump has praised General Motors, Ford, Carrier, Wal-Mart and other businesses that also have announced expansion or hiring plans in the past month. AutoZone said it will be hiring sales representatives, delivery drivers, parts sales managers, commercial sales managers, store managers and hub specialists. Applications must be submitted online at the AutoZone careers site, www.autozone.com/careers. AutoZone said it has hired more than 10,000 current and former U. S. Military Service members since 2015 and has a goal of hiring more than 15,000 additional transitioning service members and military veterans by 2020. Boeing workers vote on Charleston union The International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM) filed petition Friday with the National Labor Relations Board to hold a union election for approximately 2,850 production employees at the Boeing Co. in North Charleston, S.C. The filing comes after the IAM postponed a scheduled April 22, 2015, union election amid political criticism of organized labor at the plant. "Boeing workers just want to be treated with the respect they deserve," said IAM Boeing SC Lead Organizer Mike Evans. "Why should they be subject to a different set of standards and rules than folks building the exact same plane in Seattle?" Evans said "it was impossible to hold a free and fair election" in 2015, but he thinks the union is now ready for a union certification election. Workers have remained in contact with IAM organizers in recent months regarding numerous workplace concerns that remain unaddressed, including subjective raises, inconsistent scheduling policies and a lack of respect on the shop floor, Evans said. The NLRB is expected to issue election dates and locations in the coming weeks. The IAM already represents more than 35,000 Boeing employees at 24 locations nationwide. China's growth slows as trade war looms BEIJING — China's economic growth sank to a three-decade low in 2016 as its struggling exporters brace for a possible trade battle with President-elect Donald Trump. Growth in the quarter ending in December ticked up to 6.8 percent over 2015, supported by government spending and a real estate boom, a gain from the previous quarter's 6.7 percent, government data showed Friday. Still, for the full year, growth came in at a lackluster 6.7 percent, down from 6.9 percent in 2015 and the weakest since 1990's 3.9 percent. That temporary upturn is unlikely to last, economists said. 'Net neutrality' foe named to head FCC President Donald Trump has reportedly picked a fierce critic of the Obama-era "net neutrality" rules to be chief regulator of the nation's airwaves and internet connections. Citing unidentified people, Bloomberg and Politico both reported Friday that the next chairman of the Federal Communications Commission will be Ajit Pai, an old hand at the agency. Pai's chief of staff, Matthew Berry, declined to comment. FCC spokesmen did not immediately reply to emails. Pai is one of the two Republican commissioners on a five-member panel that regulates the country's communications infrastructure, including TV, phone and internet service. Las Vegas Sands pays to end probe Las Vegas Sands Corp. will pay almost $7 million to U.S. authorities to end a more than five-year corrupt practices investigation, company and federal officials said Thursday. With the agreement, the company resolved twin probes over more than $60 million paid to an unnamed agent retained in 2006 to acquire a Chinese basketball team, plus other business dealings that include a Beijing real estate deal to promote casinos on the Cotai Strip of Macao. The company wasn't charged with a crime and did not admit guilt in either case. Apple depicts Qualcomm as a shady monopolist SAN FRANCISCO — Apple is suing mobile chip maker Qualcomm for $1 billion in a patent fight pitting the iPhone maker against one of its major suppliers. The complaint filed Friday in a San Diego federal court depicts Qualcomm as a monopolist abusing its power in a key segment of the mobile chip market to extort royalties for iPhone innovations that have nothing to do with Qualcomm's technology. Apple says it has been cooperating with government regulators who have been investigating Qualcomm's business practices, prompting Qualcomm to retaliate by withholding about $1 billion in scheduled payments. Mars Skittles to be used for cattle feed Mars Inc. says it doesn't know why Skittles found on a rural Wisconsin highway might have been headed to become cattle feed. The case began when a Wisconsin sheriff posted on Facebook this week that "hundreds of thousands of Skittles" had been found spilled on a highway. Later, he updated the post to say the candy had fallen off a truck on its way to be cattle feed. A variety of food byproducts are commonly used for animal feed, and Skittles maker Mars says it has procedures for discarding foods for that purpose. However, the company said the Skittles in question came from a factory that doesn't sell unused products for animal feed. AT&T adds 200,000 DirectTV subscribers AT&T beat analysts' expectations and signed up new pay-TV customers for the first time in seven quarters with its new online video streaming service, DirecTV Now. The streaming service offers a lineup that's similar to cable TV but doesn't require a cable box, satellite dish or annual contract. The Dallas-based company reported that at least 200,000 video subscribers signed up in the fourth quarter, according to a Friday filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Analysts were expecting 61,000, according to a Bloomberg report. AT&T launched the new service in late November and pushed a promotional offer for early subscribers of $35 a month for 100-plus channels. That same channel lineup is now $60 a month. AT&T is the largest pay-TV provider in the U.S. with more than 25 million subscribers but it faces a more competitive and fragmented TV landscape. Cable and satellite subscribers are on the decline. The company must fend off new rivals like Netflix, Amazon and Hulu. AT&T's answer is its own video streaming service: DirecTV Now. The streaming service includes a more traditional cable lineup but is missing the CBS network and features such as DVR. Customers must pay extra for premium channels, HBO and Cinemax.

The union said that Boeing workers have contacted IAM organizers “regarding numerous workplace concerns that remain unaddressed, including subjective raises, inconsistent scheduling policies and a lack of respect on the shop floor.” The IAM postponed a worker vote on union representation scheduled for April 2015, claiming “unprecedented political interference on the part of South Carolina lawmakers and the rampant spread of misinformation among Boeing workers.” The union already represents more than 35,000 Boeing employees at 24 U.S. locations. The company employs about 2,850 production employees at the North Charleston plant. For its part, Boeing repeated its belief that union representation is not in the best interests of South Carolina “teammates and their families, their communities, and the state of South Carolina.” Boeing vice-president and general manager of the North Charleston plant, Joan Robinson-Berry, said: Our team has achieved an impressive list of amazing and historic accomplishments here in South Carolina in a remarkably short period of time, without the IAM. We’ve done it thanks to a belief – shared by our teammates – that we could build something special here through a commitment to working together for mutual success. We have not forgotten the IAM’s history in South Carolina, including their repeated insults regarding our teammates’ abilities, their contract with Vought that took away many of the benefits those teammates already had, their attempt to keep Boeing from building 787s in South Carolina through their claim with the NLRB, and their abandoned petition in April 2015. There’s simply no reason to believe that anything has changed between then and now. Referring to 2015’s postponed vote, IAM’s lead organizer for the South Carolina plant, Mike Evans, said: I can unequivocally say there will be a vote this time around. We’ve met with numerous workers at Boeing in recent months and are confident they will see through any attempts by the company to divert attention away from the numerous workplace issues that need fixed. Evans added, “Boeing workers just want to be treated with the respect they deserve. Why should they be subject to a different set of standards and rules than folks building the exact same plane in Seattle?” The NLRB is likely to announce election dates and locations in the coming weeks, according to the IAM press announcement. Boeing’s shares traded down about 0.4% in the noon hour Friday, at $158.34 in a 52-week range of $102.10 to $160.30. The high was posted earlier in the day. The stock’s 12-month consensus price target is $161.70.

While the government has been pushing for better connectivity of smaller cities and has thrown in several incentives for the airlines, it is expected that 45 new airports will get added to the existing list of 73 operational airports. Even as the plane orders and purchase rights reflect the need to serve the double-digit growth in the domestic market, lack of airport infrastructure can emerge as one of the key hurdles. This comes on the face of a rising passenger traffic in India which is set to cross 10 crore by March-end, making India the third-largest aviation market after the US and China, taking over from Japan. “Capacity constraints at India’s metro airports have already become visible. The situation at key metros such as Mumbai and Chennai is particularly acute as these airports are fast approaching saturation. But slot constraints and congestion are an issue at most of the metro airports and are expected to remain so in the near term as new terminals and runways will take 2-3 years to develop,” Centre for Asia Pacific Aviation (CAPA) said in its India Aviation Outlook for 2017-18. The report further says that India faces the prospect of an airport capacity crisis. Delays in developing a long-term national airport plan could jeopardise economic growth. “Based on projected growth rates, most of the 40 largest airports in the country will exceed their design capacities within the next decade. However, it is a serious concern that there is no long-term vision for India’s airport capacity requirements,” it said. India currently has 1,632 aircraft registered in the Civil Aviation Registry, which include planes manufactured by Boeing, Airbus and other smaller companies. According to data provided by Airbus, India’s largest airline by passenger traffic — IndiGo — alone had 406 pending deliveries as of December 31. The airline had 126 A320 aircraft, comprising of 14 A320neo as on December 31. The company expects that by year-end its fleet size to be 136, with delays in delivery of A320neo expected be offset by induction of used aircraft on short term leases. While state-owned carrier Air India has pending deliveries of 8 Boeing 787 aircraft, private carrier GoAir is awaiting 140 A320 neo aircraft from Airbus. Jet Airways, the country’s second largest air transporter, is also awaiting deliveries of a total 85 aircraft from Boeing — 737 Max and 787 — and five A330 aircraft from Airbus. Of its pending deliveries of 29 Airbus planes, Air India has signed agreement for 14 aircraft with leasing and finance company ALAFCO. Out of next 15 units, for 8 aircraft, the state-owned carrier has signed the letter of intent with two lessors and final agreement is in process. The state-owned carrier is also expecting deliveries of eight Boeing 787 aircraft. Passenger growth As per data available with the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), India recorded 8.52 crore domestic air passengers in 2015-16, a growth of 21.6 per cent over the previous year. The passenger load factor also increased to 82.9 per cent in 2015-16, from 79 per cent in 2014-15 and 73.3 per cent in 2013-14, the DGCA data showed. The number of international passengers taking Indian carriers grew 7.5 per cent in 2015-16 to 1.86 crore. The load factor for international passengers rose to 79.3 in 2015-16 from 78.6 in 2014-15. After a strong jump in 2015-16, traffic growth rose further in 2016-17. During 2016, domestic airlines carried 9.98 crore domestic passengers as compared with 8.10 crore during the corresponding period of the previous year, a growth of 23.18 per cent. Private airlines accounted for 85.4 per cent of the total domestic passengers, while 14.6 per cent flew Air India domestically. With the domestic passenger base set to cross 10 crore by March 2017, India will overtake Japan this year to become the world’s third largest domestic market behind the USA and China. Domestic traffic could grow by close to 25 per cent in 2017-18 and approach 13 crore passengers, with the next financial year expected to be the third consecutive year of domestic growth above 20 per cent, according to CAPA India estimates. Airport infrastructure As some airports including big ones such as Delhi and Mumbai are nearing saturation in terms of passenger capacity, the government is undertaking expansion and modernisation at aerodrome facilities in the country, hitherto at a slower pace. According to a response by civil aviation minister Ashok Gajapathi Raju in the Lok Sabha on December 15, 2016, as of November 30, out of 33 works undertaken at Airports Authority of India’s airports in the last 4 years, work completion on 20 occasions were less than 75 per cent. These include projects such as resurfacing of runways, expansion to accommodate certain bigger aircraft, expansion of aprons, expansion and modification of terminal buildings, construction of parallel taxiways, among others. Furthermore, the government is planning to develop 50 no-frill airports in the country in the next four years at an estimated cost of Rs 4,500 crore. The Niti Aayog, in its review of the infrastructure sector for the financial year 2015-16, had stated that privatised airports recorded higher performance with regard to customer satisfaction when compared with their counterparts operated solely by the AAI. As per the Airport Service Quality Index, the top 11 AAI airports have been rated 4.53 on a scale of 5.00 during 2015-16, against a target of 4.55 and a benchmark of 4.88. The Aayog has also identified several airports — including Ahmedabad, Indore, Pune, Nagpur — that fall in the middle-rung as per their performance and could do with improvement to make their services more efficient.

Rockwell Collins Inc. Chief Executive Kelly Ortberg also expressed optimism that the new administration could be a catalyst for the long-awaited recovery in the business-jet market after years of flat or declining sales. Mr. Ortberg said he expected a repeat of the previous cycle for big jets when backlogs at Boeing Co. and Airbus Group SE sustained production even as orders dipped and more airlines sought to defer new aircraft. "We're going to continue to see the narrow-body because of the strong backlog, continue to ramp up at both [companies]," he said, forecasting that the order cycle would continue through 2020 when Boeing's new 777X jet is due to enter service. Boeing and Airbus last year both secured new orders that fell short of their deliveries but still plan to boost output over the next three years for most models, the exception being some widebody jets where demand has weakened over the past two years. Cedar Rapids, Iowa-based Rockwell Collins has doubled down on what some analysts call a supercycle that has amassed a $1 trillion order book for the two big plane makers, including 10,000 more fuel-efficient narrow-body jets that will become the backbone of the global airline industry. Rockwell Collins in October agreed to pay $6.4 billion for B/E Aerospace Inc., one of the biggest makers of aircraft seats and interiors, marrying it with its own specialty in cockpit and communication systems. The proposed deal received a mixed reception from some analysts who viewed it as pricey and questioned the timing, but Mr. Ortberg said investors had warmed to the potential synergies and expected a shareholder vote in March. Subject to investor and regulatory approval, he expects it to close by May. France's Safran SA this week agreed to pay $9 billion for the other large seat maker, Zodiac Aerospace SA. His comments came as Rockwell Collins opened the aerospace and defense reporting season with fiscal first-quarter profits that fell short of expectations because of costs related to the B/E Aerospace deal, though the company reaffirmed its full-year guidance. Its shares were recently up 1.6% at $90.65 in a weak session for a sector that has underperformed so far this year. Rockwell Collins also has a large defense business, providing systems on jets such as the Lockheed Martin Corp. F-35 and Boeing's Pegasus refueling tanker. Sales are expected to grow with rising military spending, though Mr. Ortberg said they could be crimped this year if the temporary Pentagon budget that runs through April is extended. The defense and business jet markets have weighed on Rockwell Collins over the past few years, but the run-up in stock markets and potentially more supportive tax policies from the Trump administration have increased optimism that the latter will also start to improve. "I'm hopeful the new administration will create confidence in the marketplace," said Mr. Ortberg. "It could be the catalyst we need," he said. Rockwell Collins reported profits of $145 million for the quarter compared with $135 million a year earlier, with per-share earnings rising to $1.10 from $1.02. Revenue increased 2.1% to $1.19 billion.

In dueling press conferences held Friday morning, a representative with the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers announced plans to file for an election on whether to unionize and Boeing Vice President and General Manager Joan Robinson-Berry said the company would use every resource they have to make sure workers say "no."  Lead IAM organizer Mike Evans said he hopes Boeing's thousands of state employees will say "yes." "Workers at Boeing deserve to be treated fairly and they deserve to be treated with respect," Evans said at 7 a.m. Friday. "Over the past year and a half, management at Boeing has repeatedly failed to make improvements they promised workers. Instead, workplace policies remain inconsistent and raises remain subjective. Boeing workers deserve better than that."  IAM plans to file their petition for the election with the National Labor Board today. The election is set to begin in February should be around 23 days. Evens said employees will be able to cast their ballots in a private and neutral area to prevent discrimination. A majority of more than 50 percent of votes is needed to secure union representation. Live 5 News "We're gonna utilize whatever resource we need to be successful in winning this campaign," Boeing's Robinson-Berry replied at a news conference two hours later. She said they would do so while still focused on building airplanes and rolling out the new Boeing 787-10, which is being built exclusively in South Carolina.  "Boeing believes firmly that a union is not in the best interest of Boeing South Carolina," Robinson-Berry said. "That's been our consistent position and we will never change that."  Live 5 News In response to complaints that local Boeing employees are paid less than those in Washington, Robinson-Berry said the company pays at or above market value. "We have no energy and time to focus on things that are negative," Robinson-Berry said. "We only have energy to focus on things that matter to our customers, and that's bringing value each and every day." The machinists union has been trying to unionize the plant for seven years. In 2015, the IAM tried to get workers to sign a petition to form a union. A spokesperson claims they withdrew that petition after Boeing officials created a “toxic environment” for their workers during the campaign. "Withdrawing this petition is not an option," Evans said. "Boeing workers will vote." As recent as Tuesday, Boeing SC posted to Facebook urging people to say no to the IAM’s attempt at forming a union. According to WeAreBoeingSC.com, if a union wins an election, the union would become the “exclusive” representative of all employees in the voting group, regardless of their vote to join the union.  South Carolina is a Right to Work state where union membership cannot be mandated for employment.

Lauderdale, Fla.  (Photo: Taimy Alvarez, AP) WASHINGTON – Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx said the latest proposal to require airlines and ticket agents to disclose baggage fees when listing fares is an example of consumer regulations the department pursued for travelers during his tenure. The rule proposed Tuesday would require airlines and agents to disclose the cost of the first and second checked bags, and carry-on bags, when providing airfares. The department proposed the bag-fee rule because the fees traditionally were included in fares, but increasingly have been charged separately during the last decade. The fees generated $3.8 billion in 2015. “We’ve worked hard to improve the environment for consumers in aviation,” Foxx, in a roundtable with reporters Thursday on his last full day of the administration. “We’ve certainly worked to ensure that there is an optimal level of competition.” The proposal, which is open for public comment for 60 days, is the latest administration effort to make fares easier to compare.

The bag-fee proposal is the latest regulation or proposal that the Obama administration has adopted as part of its effort to make travel costs and rules more obvious for travelers. In October, the department proposed that travelers get a refund of bag fees if the luggage arrives late. The department wants to hear from airlines, travelers and others how late is too late. USA TODAY How late is late? DOT to set terms for airline checked bag fee refunds Congress told the department to complete the rule by July, with refunds for bags more than 12 hours late on a domestic flight or 15 hours on an international flight. But the secretary could extend those deadlines to 18 hours for domestic and 30 hours for international flights. Other airline-related regulations floated under the Obama administration include: ►  A requirement that airlines publish more information about their on-time arrivals and lost baggage. Those regulations will go into effect in 2018. ► More protections for travelers with disabilities, who face obstacles like handicapped-inaccessible bathrooms and in-flight entertainment that doesn't provide adaptions for blind or deaf passengers. But the DOT is also moving to limit the use of emotional support animals. USA TODAY Phony comfort pets, owners perplex airlines USA TODAY Attention, fliers: You may need to leave your 'comfort' animal at home ► A proposal to require more transparency for online ticket platforms "so sites can’t privilege one airline over another without you knowing about it." Some airlines, including Southwest, don't make fares available for comparison, and the Department of Transportation is seeking comments on whether they should be required to do so. “We’ve certainly put out several rules over the course of time I‘ve been here that are consumer oriented, rules that for example required greater disclosure by some of the internet companies over which people buy their plane tickets, so that the baggage fees are disclosed,” Foxx said. Earlier, the administration approved the use of electronic devices aboard planes. “All that is about trying to make the experience of flying better, easier and more convenient for those who are traveling over the sky,” Foxx said. “I also think that we’ve done some things that have a made it a little more pleasant, like allowing people to use their electronic devices on planes.” “That’s been a real winner in my household, and probably yours too,” said Foxx, who has children aged 10 and 12.

Boeing & Aerospace Business War of words starts as Machinists union files for organizing vote at Boeing South Carolina Originally published January 20, 2017 at 11:35 am Updated January 20, 2017 at 12:10 pm 787 Dreamliners are assembled at the Boeing South Carolina plant in North Charelston. The Machinists union has filed a petition for a vote to organize the plant’s production workers. (Mic Smith / Special to The Seattle Times) (Mic Smith) The National Labor Relations Board is expected to call for a vote in mid- to late-February to decide if the International Association of Machinists will represent the approximately 2,850 production employees in North Charleston. Share story By Dominic Gates Seattle Times aerospace reporter With the official announcement Friday morning by the Machinists union that it has filed a petition for a vote to organize production workers at Boeing South Carolina, the union and management immediately entered into a bitter war of words. The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) is now expected to call for a vote in mid- to late-February to decide if the International Association of Machinists (IAM) will represent the approximately 2,850 production employees in North Charleston. Mike Evans, the IAM’s lead organizer at Boeing South Carolina, said Friday that wages are 36 percent lower there than in the Puget Sound region factories represented by the union. “Boeing workers just want to be treated with the respect they deserve,” said Evans. “Why should they be subject to a different set of standards and rules than folks building the exact same plane in Seattle?” Jon Talton Vote: Does the Machinists union stand a chance in South Carolina? He said the union was forced to postpone a previous vote in April 2015 “due to unprecedented political interference on the part of South Carolina lawmakers and the rampant spread of misinformation among Boeing workers.” He said the company had hired outside anti-union lawyers to wage a campaign of “mistruths and outright lies” as well as intimidation of workers. The union canceled the previous vote when it was clear it wouldn’t have a majority. But this time, Evans said, “we feel this group is ready to take a stand.” “I can unequivocally say there will be a vote this time around,” he said. “We’ve met with numerous workers at Boeing in recent months and are confident.” Joan Robinson-Berry, vice president and general manager at Boeing South Carolina, issued a response criticizing the union’s record in North Charleston. She recalled the poor contract the union signed in 2007 with Boeing supplier Vought, before Boeing took over the plant, which led to the workers voting to decertify the union two years later. She cited remarks by IAM representatives in Washington state during the 2009 campaign to win a second 787 Dreamliner assembly line that contrasted the experienced workforce in Everett with the lack of experience in North Charleston. She characterized those remarks as “repeated insults regarding our teammates’ abilities.” And she recalled how, after Boeing did locate the second 787 assembly line in North Charleston, the IAM claimed it was in retaliation for its Puget Sound workers going on strike the previous year and petitioned the NLRB to block the new assembly line. “While we’ve continued to grow and improve here at Boeing South Carolina, nothing has changed with the IAM,” said Robinson-Berry. “Our teammates have good memories. They’ve not forgotten the IAM’s poor history here.” In a news conference outside the plant, Robinson-Berry responded to the IAM’s reference to the higher wages of Boeing workers in the Puget Sound region by saying that the company pays its South Carolina workforce “at or above market today in this region.” Asked about Boeing’s hiring of an outside anti-union law firm to help in its campaign for a “no” vote, she said the company will use “every resource available to us” to ensure “a union-free environment” in South Carolina. Boeing and the IAM have set up competing websites and Facebook pages to reach out to the workforce. At the company website, a video shows someone speaking as if he’s a Boeing South Carolina worker, complaining that the “the IAM is back,” and that this is “the same union that insulted us and our abilities for years … the same union that left a trail of broken promises.” However, the person in the video is not an employee, but “a paid spokesman,” Boeing confirmed.

Banking & Finance Construction Education Energy Healthcare Media Real Estate Retail Technology Transport Travel & Hospitality High hopes: Boeing's Bernie Dunn With $770bn worth of plane orders up for grabs in the Middle East over the next 20 years, and the re-emergence of Iran Air, Boeing regional president Bernie Dunn is preparing for take-off Article Photos By Parag Deulgaonkar Friday, 20 January 2017 1:33 AM Bernie Dunn joined Boeing in 2012 after serving in a variety of infantry command and staff positions in the US Army, including as attaché to Jordan. Bernie Dunn may have retired from the US Army but he remains on a mission in the Middle East. The Boeing regional president hit a bullseye on December 11 when his team secured an $8 billion deal with Iran Air in the airline’s first plane contract since 1979. The world’s largest aerospace manufacturer beat out its French rival, Airbus, by 11 days. Though Airbus then secured 20 more planes than Boeing, with 100 compared to 80. Dunn, who says the Boeing deal was organised in Dubai in conjunction with the Seattle office, is effectively working to make the famous American cliché ‘if it ain’t Boeing, I ain’t going’ a reality in the Middle East. With that in mind, the company’s most recent report on future projections in the aviation industry predicts the Middle East will need 3,310 new airplanes worth $770bn over the next 20 years. The region takes the prime slot in Boeing’s global commercial airplane business - the UAE is the third biggest buyer of Boeing planes, followed by Turkey (fourth) and Qatar (seventh). The Middle East has one of the world's fastest growing aviation sectors and requires 3,310 new aircraft valued at $770bn over 20 years, says Boeing. One in every five Boeing 777s currently being manufactured is scheduled to land in the UAE, with Dubai's Emirates Airline the largest single Boeing customer. Historically, UAE airlines have ordered more than 600 Boeing aircraft since 1997, including purchases and leases, and have another 560 confirmed bookings. “Our orders are holding firm. We are very happy about that,” says Dunn, Boeing’s president for Middle East, North Africa and Turkey (MENAT). He maintains the view despite Boeing announcing plans to cut production of its twin-aisle 777 jetliner to five a month in August 2017, from 8.3 a month in December last year. “The production cut will not affect the delivery schedule in the region. We will, of course, fulfil our backlog with our regional customers,” Dunn assures. The fluent-Arabic speaker has spent three decades living and working in the Middle East, including as US Army attaché to Saudi Arabia, Jordan and Syria (separately). He joined Boeing in 2012, taking up his current role spanning North Africa, the Middle East and Turkey in May 2015, and adding Iran after sanctions were lifted in January 2016. “This is something new for Boeing. We never approached this region with such a broad perspective,” Dunn reveals. “It has allowed us to integrate our efforts across a vast region. We are actually finding opportunities that we didn’t have before and we are turning over rocks that hadn’t been turned over for years.” The company is investing in fuel-efficient airplanes to meet rapid fleet expansion in the region. Though Boeing has primarily focused on the aviation industry heavyweights the UAE and Qatar, the company is now actively seeking opportunities in other regional markets. “We now have a continuous focus on every market in the region, and as a result of that we are not missing anything in any market,” Dunn says. He describes the Iran Air deal – worth $16.6bn before a substantial discount was offered – “important” but adds that there are still “a couple of contingencies” to work through. “We are quite confident they will be sorted through and finalised.” Dunn says despite two years of low oil prices – which, while they have helped to lower airlines’ costs, have hit the broader Middle East economy, slowing demand growth - and regional uncertainties, Boeing has kept its aircraft projections steady. It expects the new aircraft requirements will also fuel the need for an additional 55,000 pilots, 66,000 technicians and 92,000 cabin crew. “We have not changed our [forecast],” Dunn says. Boeing is pursuing opportunities in regional markets outside the Gulf, including Turkey and Iran. “We are still looking to ‘very’ good things out here in the region. The region is important for us - both from the defence and commercial side.” Late last year, the US State Department approved the sale of Boeing fighter jets to Kuwait and Qatar in deals estimated to be worth about $10.1bn and $21.1bn, respectively. Boeing would not confirm whether the sales have been finalised. Dunn says the planemaker remains “more” bullish on the commercial segment. “If you look at the world, more people are moving into the middle class. They have more disposable income and can fly more than ever before. And that trend just continues,” he says. Each of the six Gulf Cooperation Council member states are investing billions of dollars in building world-class aviation infrastructure. Dubai has announced $15.8bn worth of investment to expand its two airports, while Abu Dhabi is spending $2.9bn on its new airport terminal complex, Saudi Arabia plans to upgrade more than 20 airport facilities, and Oman, Qatar and Kuwait have announced mega airport expansion projects. “An investment in the commercial aviation industry is an investment in your own economy,” Dunn argues. In the UAE, Boeing has tied up with Strata Manufacturing and Tawazun Precision Industries, boosting local manufacturing and creating high-skilled jobs. In April 2012, Boeing and Mubadala, an Abu Dhabi-based investment and development company, signed a 10-year contract for Strata Manufacturing to produce composite parts for Boeing 777s and 787s, such as vertical fin ribs for the 787. “It was a landmark contract, and we are looking very much forward to that,” Dunn says. The Middle East needs 55,000 new pilots. The deal will also see Emirati engineers trained at Boeing’s Salt Lake City plant in Utah, US, to gain first-hand knowledge in manufacturing of the vertical fin. “They will come back and teach their own workforces on how it is done,” he says, not ruling out the possibility of the Abu Dhabi company building parts for the 777X - the largest and most efficient twin-engine jet in the world. The three big Gulf carriers - Emirates, Etihad Airways, and Qatar Airways – are among Boeing’s major regional clients, having provided them with its largest commercial aviation order for 777X aircraft at the 2013 Dubai Airshow. The strong investment has given the airlines input to the aircraft’s final design.  “The UAE is a very strong market for the 777, and it is only going to get stronger as 777X comes online, around 2020,” Dunn says. “They [UAE airlines] love that airplane… they wanted it go farther, carry more people, do more things and that required a re-design of the existing aircraft [777X and 777].”   While Dubai International Airport built a terminal dedicated to the world’s biggest aircraft, the A380, Dunn says to avoid Airbus’ lacklustre sales of the oversized A380s, Boeing adopted technology from its fighter aircraft for the 777X wings. “We did not want to do what Airbus did and have to reconfigure airports with their A380s. We wanted to use the existing airport infrastructure and the existing box to park in at the fingers [dock],” he says. “When you build a fighter airplane for use on an aircraft carrier, you fold the wings to get it down to the hanger below. The same technology has allowed us to easily figure out how to flip the wings for the 777X.” Emirates is the world's largest single Boeing customer, delivering 16 Boeing 777-300ERs in 2016. As biofuels gain more traction across the globe, Boeing tied up with Etihad, Masdar Institute of Science and Technology, and jet fuel company Takreer in 2016 to launch a research facility in Masdar City, Abu Dhabi, to cultivate plants that could produce renewable jet fuel. The Salicornia plant, which grows in the coastal waters of the Gulf region, is believed to contain more oil per volume than petroleum. “For that reason, we are on the cutting edge of this sort of research because our industry is moving in that direction. And Abu Dhabi is a major node for us in regards to our research and development,” Dunn says. Dunn is reserved on when the biofuel may be used on a commercial jet but says Etihad will be the test airline. The European Union also wants to increase the share of sustainable low carbon fuels in its aviation sector to 40 percent by 2050, while the International Air Transport Association plans to achieve carbon-neutral growth from 2020, and a 50 percent CO2 emissions reduction by 2050. At the Dubai Airshow in 2015, Boeing inked an agreement with Dubai Aviation City to establish its Middle East headquarters in Dubai South’s aviation district. A year later, the company says it is still “committed” to its plan. “We will move at the right moment and that moment is calibrated against the movement of Flydubai and Emirates to Dubai South,” Dunn says. “So when our customers move, we will move with them. We want to remain aligned and close to them.” However, Boeing will continue to maintain its presence at Dubai Airport Freezone. “We are not going to abandon our customer set here. We are going to do this in a systematic way so it allows us to have business continuity with our customers.” Boeing agreed to sell 80 planes to Iran's national carrier in the first deal of its kind since 1979. The UAE General Civil Aviation Authority says in its 2017-2021 strategy report that the future will include solar powered aircraft, passenger-carrying drones and flying cars, but Dunn suggests pilotless planes could already be used. “The technology already exists. It is just people really don’t want to fly in a plane that has no pilot. But it can be done right now,” he says. Boeing has a contract with the US government to convert F16 fighter planes into target drones, which can take-off and land by remote control. But while Hyperloop becomes the buzz word across the globe, which involves people whizzing through gigantic pipes in pods at extremely high speeds, Dunn says airlines are focused on conducting “classic” air travel economically rather than speeding up flight. “They [airlines] want it to be done more economically, with much of it driven by high fuel cost,” Dunn says. “If you notice today, commercial aviation does not travel any faster than it did with a Boeing 707 back in 1960, but it travels much more efficiently. You carry more people, you go farther, and you do it at less cost. That’s what our customers are seeking.” Boeing assembles its aircraft in the US. While reports suggest Airbus is gaining ground in the Middle East, Dunn is unmoved by the headwinds. “We are competing very effectively with them. We dominate in this region in the wide body sector, and we are doing quite well in the single-aisle sector,” he says. Dunn is confident his experience in the region and ability to speak the local language is creating business opportunities for the American planemaker. “You know the folks in this part of the world so much appreciate that you have taken the time to learn their language and culture. It allows you to open doors [and] develop relationships, and that helps a lot,” he says. A jet research hub is planned in Masdar City.

It is the second time IAM is seeking an election to represent Boeing’s North Charleston workers. The IAM withdrew its first unionizing petition with the NLRB April 17, 2015, a week before the scheduled vote. At the time, IAM said the decision was made after union organizers conducted home visits with more than 1,700 Boeing South Carolina workers, citing a “toxic environment and gross violations of workers’ lawful organizing rights” as the reason it withdrew the petition. IAM Boeing South Carolina lead organizer Mike Evans said at the time the IAM did not believe a free and fair election was possible. With the new petition filed Jan. 20, IAM said organizers have continued to receive reports from Boeing South Carolina workers “regarding numerous workplace concerns that remain unaddressed, including subjective raises, inconsistent scheduling policies and a lack of respect on the shop floor.” “Boeing workers just want to be treated with the respect they deserve,” Evans said. “Why should they be subject to a different set of standards and rules than folks building the exact same plane in Seattle?” In a statement, Boeing said it “firmly believes that a union is not in the best interest of Boeing South Carolina teammates and their families, their communities, and the state of South Carolina, and has consistently held that position for several years.” “Our [Boeing South Carolina] teammates already have a voice, and their ideas, concerns and feedback have driven many changes for the better, and continue to do so today,” Boeing South Carolina VP and GM Joan Robinson-Berry said. “We believe our teammates deserve to keep their hard-earned money in their pockets while continuing to work with the company to drive meaningful change." The NLRB is expected to issue election dates and locations in the coming weeks. “I can unequivocally say there will be a vote this time around,” Evans said. “We’ve met with numerous workers at Boeing in recent months and are confident they will see through any attempts by the company to divert attention away from the numerous workplace issues that need fixed.” Boeing builds 787-8s and 787-9s at both its facilities in Everett, Washington and South Carolina. Final assembly of 787-10 aircraft, which will be 18 ft. (5.5 m) longer than the 787-9, is exclusive to Boeing’s North Charleston facility. Final assembly on the first 787-10 began in late 2016; its first flight is scheduled for this year. First delivery is scheduled for 2018 to United Airlines. United’s 787-10s will be powered by GE Aviation GEnx-1B engines.  Nine customers have ordered 149 787-10s, according to Boeing.

Moore is a digital news media consultant based in New York and a former editor, columnist and reporter for publications including the Guardian U.S. and the Wall Street Journal. The Post's Fact Checker took a closer look at the claims President-elect Donald Trump made during a speech in Indiana on Dec. 1, about the deal to keep jobs at a Carrier plant there that were due to be shipped to Mexico. (Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post) If the economy is ever going to improve, President Trump is just going to have to do it himself. That, at least, seems to be Trump’s guiding principle as chief executive of the United States. Previous presidents used the office as a bully pulpit to talk about what should be done, in general macroeconomic terms. Trump, instead, is pursuing the ultimate in ultra-microeconomics; he acts like he wants to walk into the boardrooms of major corporations and tell them how they should be run, how many people they should hire and where. His method: Persuade executives to appease him personally and allow him to take credit for their job creation, in a kind of modern economic version of droit de seigneur. He praises the companies that help his interests and shames the ones whose executives express concerns about his erratic leadership or vague policies on free trade, health care or defense. The result: All major U.S. corporations are now in the customer service business, and Trump is their main customer. But Trump’s apparent understanding of the president’s duties on economic policy — that he should micromanage every part of it personally — can’t end well for workers, employers or stockholders. It can’t even end well for Trump, who will find out soon that his technique is limited and that he’s more likely to burn out than to make any kind of dent. * * * Workers have already seen their jobs used as bargaining chips between the Trump administration and their employers. Even as president-elect, Trump’s meddling in the affairs of large U.S. companies was unprecedented. Trump and his vice president, Mike Pence, personally negotiated with Carrier to give the company a $7 million tax break to keep jobs in the United States. When Japan’s SoftBank wanted to find a better U.S. regulatory reception for Sprint, which it owns, chief executive Masayoshi Son found a way to allow Trump to take credit for the company’s previously announced plan to create 5,000 jobs. Amazon, whose founder Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post, recently announced plans to add 100,000 jobs over the next 18 months, which Trump’s team happily took credit for. To thank Linda Bean, a member of the board of Maine-based clothing retailer L.L. Bean who’d given money to support his election, Trump urged his 20.6 million Twitter followers to buy L.L. Bean products. On the flip side, when Boeing’s chief executive mildly critiqued Trump’s trade plans, the president-elect let loose with a storm of Twitter attacks that soon had the errant executive trying to make up with Trump. It’s all in pursuit of the greater glory of the Trump name. The president will say his intention is to save jobs that would otherwise be lost overseas. The truth won’t back that up: Corporations are complex institutions, and they have limited resources. A firm may save some jobs to support Trump’s boasting and join in the reflected glory, but it could then just as easily cut jobs in another division less likely to catch the eye of the White House. The Carrier deal, for instance, which Trump bragged that he’d spent Thanksgiving trying to put together, doesn’t look quite so good out of the spotlight. Most of the $16 million the company promised Trump it would invest in its Indiana plant will go toward automating the factory — which means some of the jobs saved will eventually be eliminated anyway. And those jobs — a total of about 800 — cost $7 million in Indiana state tax credits to keep. If Trump pulled off the same kind of deal every month of his first term, he’d spend $336 million to save about 35,000 jobs. (A total of 11.3 million jobs were created during Barack Obama’s eight years in office.) [I’m the union leader Donald Trump attacked. I’m tired of being lied to about our jobs.] In reality, the U.S. economy is enormous: Our gross domestic product, the total sum of goods and services in the country, hovers around $17 trillion annually. One human cannot move that needle manually, particularly from the White House, which manufactures nothing but influence. Thousands of corporations and small businesses affect the economy. Trump has focused on five or six large companies that can give him headlines. The personal involvement is not designed to actually fix the economy. It can’t. Mostly, it’s theater, Trump is slowly structuring U.S. business the way he has structured his real estate holdings: by personally placing his name in giant letters on each company. Taking credit for work that’s not strictly his is a Trump specialty; it’s at the core of his licensing business, in which companies pay him to slap his name on buildings, clothes and steaks produced by others. So now, when any major company has a job-saving strategy, Trump wants to say it’s “because of me.” * * * The president’s pattern of hounding companies over decisions that could reflect badly on him follows the same hyper-personal theory of economics. Take Boeing, which won a federal contract to build the next generation of the presidential plane, Air Force One, which will be able to fly the 8,000-plus miles from Washington to Hong Kong without stopping. An hour after the company’s chief executive was quoted in a news column opposing Trump’s proposed tariffs on international trade, Trump began bashing the firm, claiming that Boeing’s Air Force contract was worth $4 billion — far too much, in his estimate. (The contract has not actually cost $4 billion yet; the government budgeted $2.7 billion for it, though that figure could go up.) “Cancel order!” he demanded. But in Trump’s world, a strident tweet is not only an attack. It is also a summons, an invitation to a negotiation where the target may attempt to atone for an error. Boeing chief executive Dennis Muilenburg immediately called Trump and then made a pilgrimage to his “winter White House, ” Mar-a-Lago, somewhat nervously praised the president-elect and promised to make the planes for less money. Marillyn Hewson, chief executive of Boeing competitor Lockheed Martin, another Trump Twitter target, also rushed to meet with Trump and soothe shareholders. The key is that they have to come to him, and only him. [Two people write Trump’s tweets. He writes the angrier ones.] Nuance and facts don’t always have a place in Trump’s view of the economy, either. He attacked Ford during the campaign last year for its plans to build a $1.6 billion factory in Mexico, then took credit this month for the company’s announcement that it would cancel those plans and invest $700 million in a plant in Michigan, creating 700 jobs. “We thought we had a really good plan . . . we thought the whole equation worked pretty well, but we got lost in the Twitter world,” said Joe Hinrichs , the Ford executive who oversees its business in the Americas. Trump blasted Ford rival General Motors for making Chevy Cruze sedans in Mexico and selling them north of the border, even though it sells the vast majority of its Mexican-made cars outside the United States. When Macy’s dropped Trump’s China-manufactured menswear line in 2015 because of the candidate’s derogatory comments about Mexican immigrants, Trump immediately called for a boycott of the retailer. He was silent, though, about news this month that the chain plans to close stores and cut thousands of jobs. The fallout from Trump’s attacks, ultimately, may not last much longer than the glow of his boasts. His tweets have sometimes driven down stock prices, but rarely by more than a percentage point, and the shares recovered fast. On Boeing’s stock chart, his Dec. 6 comments barely show up. (In fact, the next day, the company’s stock rose, and it is now near a year-long high.) High-speed traders can profit from instant Trump-driven fluctuations, even small ones, but most companies don’t have to worry that the president will wipe out their market valuations. Maybe Trump doesn’t know it yet, but even before he moved into the Oval Office on Friday, he had used up his entire economic toolbox of tweet, attack and wait. A promise that “I alone can fix it ” got him into the White House. The real economy isn’t anywhere near as simple as the campaign trail was. 200+ Comments  Share on FacebookShare   Share on TwitterTweet Share via Email Heidi N.

Plot thickens Originally published January 20, 2017 at 10:41 am Updated January 22, 2017 at 7:26 pm Back to story Restart gallery More Photo Galleries Punch stuff, sweat, get fit — ‘It’s fun’ Tallying winter’s wings: cormorants, crows, mallards and more Photos: First-time Santa in Seattle tries to ‘bring us together’ D.B. Cooper is the story that keeps on giving. A few days ago, the big headlines were about Cooper’s possibly having worked for Boeing. Never mind! The finger now points at Tektronix, of Beaverton, Ore., as his employer. Share story By Erik Lacitis Seattle Times staff reporter You know the recent stories exploring whether D.B. Cooper was a Boeing employee? Never mind. That theory only lasted a few days. Time for a new speculation. Now the attention of the “Citizen Sleuths” on whose research all those viral headlines were premised are pointing at another Pacific Northwest company as D.B. Cooper’s possible employer: Most Read Stories Seattle ‘won’t be bullied,’ will fight Trump’s sanctuary-city order, mayor says Seattle cop’s son killed after trying to stop car prowler in Sammamish  VIEW For thousands, light rail could be the only way through downtown Seattle next year What does Trump’s action on sanctuary cities mean for Seattle? Here’s what we know Seahawks assistant head coach for defense Rocky Seto leaves team to enter ministryUnlimited Digital Access. $1 for 4 weeks. Tektronix, out of Beaverton, Ore. Tek-what? Not quite the name recognition as Boeing, but it’s well-known in the electronics industry. The Boeing connection is still there, says Tom Kaye, of Sierra Vista, Ariz., who identifies himself as the principal investigator of CitizenSleuths.com. It’s just that now the group believes the titanium particles found on Cooper’s tie came from Tektronix, which may have been doing contract work for Boeing back in the 1960s through 1971 (when the project was canceled) on the supersonic transport jet, known as the SST. The group was given access to the tie by the FBI and used a powerful electron microscope and X-ray spectroscopy for its work. Kaye now believes that Cooper “was an engineer or manager type who was going back and forth between Boeing and Tektronix.” Boeing understandably says that “we have no comment on these reports.” It’s trying to sell jets, not be associated with Cooper speculation. As for Tektronix, it was founded in 1946 and holds 697 patents. It makes things like oscilloscopes — which many of us have heard of even though we couldn’t explain what they do — and optical modulation analyzers. Let’s not even try to explain the latter. This week, Amy Higgins, spokeswoman for the company, said it didn’t have employment documentation in its database that would go back some five decades. So it really couldn’t add much, she said. She also said if Tektronix had been doing work on the SST, it was likely “a confidential relationship.” It’s been 45 years since “Dan Cooper” hijacked that Northwest Orient Airlines jet, and somewhere between Seattle and Reno parachuted out with $200,000 in $20 bills. His legend is the gift that keeps on giving when it comes to stories we can’t help but read. There was the woman who had undergone transgender surgery and claimed to have been Cooper as a way to get back at the airline industry that kept her from becoming a pilot. There was the Minnesota man who believed his late brother was Cooper when the family discovered unaccounted-for money in the brother’s bank accounts. Plus, the brother had once said, “There is something you should know, but I cannot tell you.” And there are plenty more potential Coopers who have made the news but then not been linked to the case by the FBI. The agency suspended active investigation in July 2016. It’s that black clip-on J.C. Penney tie found on the seat cushion 18E, the same seat assigned to Cooper, that has been at the heart of these latest speculations. Cooper had that now-retro look down pat. The kinda-skinny tie, “alligator” tie clip, dark business suit, white shirt, aviator sunglasses. It was the look you often would see with the engineers and management at Boeing. More dramatically, it was used by Quentin Tarantino in “Reservoir Dogs.” Cooper ordered a bourbon and soda, smoked a cigarette and handed a flight attendant a note that said, in all capital letters, “I HAVE A BOMB IN MY BRIEFCASE. I WILL USE IT IF NECESSARY. I WANT YOU TO SIT NEXT TO ME. YOU ARE BEING HIJACKED.” When the attendant put the note, unread, into her pocket, Cooper said, “Miss, you’d better look at that note. I have a bomb.” Dwight Bates, 74, of Ellensburg, a Boeing retired senior propulsion engineer who worked on the SST, remembers that clip-on-tie look well. He was 23 when he worked on that plane. “Almost everybody wore a clip-on tie just like that,” he says. “Then, if you went up to the factory, you’d unclip it and put on your safety glasses. There was a lot of dirt out there and you didn’t want it on your tie, and you didn’t want your tie hanging up on rotating machinery.” But maybe some tie-wearing type did keep his tie on at the factory floor, says Bates. “There was a lot of titanium machining going,” he says. Particles would have flown about. There is just one hitch with Cooper’s possibly being a Boeing employee. The SST was being built with titanium alloy because supersonic “skin friction” would heat its hull to many hundreds of degrees Fahrenheit. But the particles found on the tie were not titanium alloy. They were pure titanium. Plus, additional testing showed the presence of rare-earth elements such as cerium and strontium sulfide. So. So a little more speculation by the Citizen Sleuths: • The rare-earth particles found on the tie are used in the making of cathode ray tubes, the kind used in old TV sets. • Kaye says the SST was going to be the first plane using cathode ray tubes on the instrument panel. • Tektronix, at that time, made such tubes and was a relatively short distance from Boeing. • But for use in the SST, the Oregon company would have had to encase the tubes in titanium, and likely used pure titanium. Connect the dots! By the way, for you retro-look fans, there are plenty of clip-on ties for sale on Amazon. A black, 100 percent polyester one goes for only $6.96, rated 4 out of 5 stars, with a feature that might have gotten Cooper’s attention. “ … it does break away cleanly and safely when pulled.” Erik Lacitis: 206-464-2237 or elacitis@seattletimes.com Twitter @ErikLacitis Email Newsletter Sign-up Custom-curated news highlights, delivered weekday mornings.

(NASDAQ: AMZN), Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (NYSE: FCAU) and other American companies. Many of these jobs were pre-planned well before Trump’s victory, but companies wishing to get on Trump’s good side seem happy to let him take the credit. Boeing Co (NYSE: BA), on the other hand, hasn’t been on Trump’s good side. The company’s plan to continue downsizing as the Trump era begins likely won’t get them there. Trump And Boeing Trump’s Boeing beef started back in December when he slammed the company on Twitter for the costs associated with the new Air Force One 747 fleet. “Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!” he tweeted. Trump has promised to bring a new era of prosperity to the U.S. economy by creating thousands of new jobs. President Barack Obama is leaving office with the unemployment rate already at its lowest point since 2007. Unfortunately, Boeing isn’t playing along. Boeing cut nearly 11,000 jobs in 2016 and plans on further cuts in 2017 as well. Trump, Boeing and China “Obviously anything that caused any kind of trade ruckus, particularly with China, that would be very bad news,” Teal Group analyst Richard Aboulafia recently explained. Trump has repeatedly bashed China, one of Boeing’s largest customers, for weakness in its currency. If Trump continues his aggressive behavior towards China and/or chooses to officially declare the country a currency manipulator, China has already specifically threatened to retaliate against companies like Boeing. A story in the Chinese newspaper The Global Times, which is backed by the Communist party, claims that “a batch of Boeing orders will be replaced by Airbus” if Trump starts a trade war with China. Plenty of American companies are poised to thrive under Trump’s proposed policies of corporate deregulation and lower taxes. Unfortunately, Boeing certainly doesn’t seem to be one of those companies.

Home Archives Ed Morrissey Show Newsletters   Why Trump’s Twitter feed should have an extra layer of security posted at 8:01 pm on January 19, 2017 by John Sexton Share on Facebook 1 1 SHARES The Atlantic’s Conor Friedersdorf published a story this morning suggesting that, for everyone’s peace of mind, Twitter should institute some kind of additional layer of security around Donald Trump’s Twitter feed. There is an argument here which makes a certain amount of sense. Trump really has made his Twitter account a key aspect of both his public persona and his blunt take on policy issues. For instance, a few weeks ago Trump tweeted that Boeing was making too much money off the Air Force One program: Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 6, 2016 After he tweeted that, he appeared to get results. The CEO of Boeing came to a meeting with Trump at his Florida resort and came out promising to bring the cost of the program down. The point here is that people already see Twitter as a place for Trump’s first reaction to breaking news and, more importantly, a place where he sometimes makes his own news. So what happens, Friedersdorf asks, if Trump gets hacked? He invites us to imagine the reaction if, one day, the world sees this tweet go out from his account, “Putin you betrayed me, BIG MISTAKE, payback incoming!” A tweet like that, especially if it was a touch less bombastic, would have a zillion and one RTs before the White House could get word out that the account had been hacked. Even worse, imagine if a hacker gained access to the account and started sending private messages to other foreign leaders announcing some policy change or pending attack. How long would it take the recipient and the White House to realize what had happened? Friedersdorf outlines a specific way in which the threat of a Trump Twitter-jacking might be alleviated. Twitter could require every tweet from Trump be authenticated by the White House Chief of Staff before it appears. That wouldn’t necessarily prevent a hacker from gaining access to the account but it would prevent him from using it to do any harm, which is the real concern. “Going forward, the @POTUS account and any verified account belonging to the sitting president should lose the ability to post anything instantaneously to the Internet,” Friedersdorf writes. The bottom line is this: If Trump is going to be the Tweeter-in-Chief, then we better make damn sure no one else can ever hijack his account.

 Wall Street has found a company that Donald Trump would love to beat up on Linette Lopez Jan. 20, 2017, 9:52 AM 23,765 facebook linkedin twitter email print Andrew Left.Bloomberg TransDigm Group is an airplane-parts maker that counts Boeing as one of its largest clients. The company's growth depends on debt-fueled acquisitions. After it acquires a company that makes unique aerospace parts, it raises the price of those parts. On Thursday, the stock's price closed at $251, but Citron Research thinks it should be hovering around $166. Since his election to the office of the president of the United States, Donald Trump has spent much of his time tweeting threats to US companies that do things he doesn't like. There are a handful of things Trump doesn't like about corporate America, but for our purposes, we'll focus on just one: companies that charge the government entirely too much money. In December, he hit Boeing, which makes the president's Air Force One 747 jet, over this. "Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order," he tweeted. It's his jet, so we suppose he can tweet about it, but he should know that for weeks, the short sellers on Wall Street — investors who bet on a decline in share prices — have been whispering about a company that they say has a firm hand in making all things Boeing so expensive. Roll-up It's airplane-part manufacturer TransDigm Group. On Friday, one of these short sellers, Andrew Left of Citron Research, published a report outlining how it inflates prices in its sector and comparing it to another target of his, Valeant Pharmaceuticals. "TransDigm's business model is to aerospace as Valeant was to the pharmaceutical industry," Left wrote. "TransDigm acquires airplane parts companies (over 50 in total), fires employees, and egregiously raises prices. This business model has made them a dominant supplier of airplane parts to the aerospace industry while burdening its balance sheet with sky-high debt load: in fact, 6.5x EBITDA leverage." What Left is a describing is also known as a "roll-up," a company that needs to make acquisitions to survive. The short version is that once it acquires a company, it uses price hikes on old products to finance its growing pile of deal debt. Markets Insider The result is that it is adding entirely too much to the cost of airplanes made by Boeing, including the iconic 747. Some analysts have wondered if Boeing is actually working on ways to cut TDG out as a result. As Left wrote, if there's a hint of familiarity here, it's because this is exactly what some drugmakers — namely Valeant — have landed in a lot of hot water for lately. Attacks on Valeant helped knock a whopping 90% off its stock price. TDG ended trading Thursday at $251 apiece, giving the company a market value of over $13 billion. Left thinks the stock is worth closer to $166 a share. TDG didn't immediately respond to requests for comment for this story, but we'll update as soon as it does. The chief That TDG, according to Left, is a roll-up, a company that grows only by acquiring other companies, is not what would bother Trump — it's what happens after that. After TDG buys generally low-priced, proprietary aerospace products, it jacks up their prices. Here's how researchers at Capitol Forum put it in a recent note: "Since TransDigm is often in a position where it the only manufacturer for a part that a company needs, it can charge prices that result in gross margins of 80-95%, according to our source who worked at Aerosonic, and price increases are one of TransDigm's most important internal key metrics." Some examples: TDG purchased Aerosonic's vibration panel and raised the price from $67.33 to $271, according to the Capitol Forum note. It bought Harco's Cable Assembly and raised the price from $1,737.03 to $7,863.60. You get the picture. And it gets worse. Once TDG can't raise prices anymore, it tends to boost its profits further by laying people off. We know how much Trump loves that. Now, it's true that price hikes by an airplane-parts company aren't going to cause the public outrage that we saw with drugmakers. And this is all stuff that flew under the radar during most of Barack Obama's administration. But risk No. 1 is that customers are starting to wake up — Boeing included. Last November, it hired Kevin McAllister from GE Aviation Services to run its commercial airplane business. Analysts at Cowen and Company took that as a sign that Boeing is going to try to rein in the cost of TDG parts. "In recent years, Boeing management has signaled a stronger thrust into capturing aftermarket business," Cowen's analysts wrote in a November note. "Our checks indicate some effort at Boeing to redesign certain TDG products that are sole-sourced." This is significant to TDG's bottom line. In 2016, Boeing was TDG's second-largest customer, making up 12% of its revenue, according to government filings. US government defense programs, according to Capitol Forum, make up 18-23% of TDG's revenue. The treadmill Though it's embarrassing, potentially spurring a Trump tweet is not the only reason TDG raises eyebrows among short sellers like Left. As with all roll-ups, ultimately you have to look under the hood and see where the company would be without aggressive accounting. To put it simply, roll-up companies don't account for the cost of doing the deal. TransDigm financial statements "Our reported EBITDA as Defined margin was strong at 47.1%, and the margins in our core businesses once again improved year over year, reflecting the power of our consistent value generation strategy," W. Nicholas Howley, TDG's CEO, president, and chairman, said in his year-end report (emphasis ours). "EBITDA as Defined" means excluding many costs of doing the acquisitions. In 2016, acquisition-based adjustments added $57.7 million to TDG's $1.5 billion EBITDA. This game is over if TDG is unable to acquire more companies, whether that's because the buying opportunities aren't out there or because deals are too expensive. (Remember, interest rates are going up.) The ball and chain Another important thing to note about all these acquisitions is that they've added significantly to TDG's debt; it's holding more than $6 billion. This has raised some eyebrows on Wall Street, specifically from the debt-ratings agency Moody's, which cited this debt in its rationalization for TDG's rating. From Moody's (emphasis ours): "During 2016, TransDigm incurred a substantial amount of indebtedness — well beyond the bounds of internally generated cash flow — to fund a large-sized special dividend to shareholders and to finance the company's aggressive acquisition strategy. "This resulted in very high financial leverage with September 2016 Moody's adjusted debt-to-EBITDA of around 7.5x. Over the next few quarters, Moody's expects TransDigm to deliver to more sustainable levels through continued earnings growth and any near-term leveraging transaction would likely result in downward rating pressure." So, like a lot of roll-ups, TDG will eventually have to prove that it can make money without acquiring companies. And if Trump is paying attention, they may have to do it without jacking up prices or laying off workers, too. Some business model.

America's top military contractors have literally been playing defense against Donald Trump, trying to shore up support for key contracts just as they are preparing to report fourth-quarter earnings. Trump has used his bully pulpit as president-elect to criticize large contractors for program delays and costs he considers out of control, and it has meant Lockheed Martin and Boeing investors have seen occasions when those stocks felt the jabs. "Even when you have contracts in place, there's going to continue to be pressure to execute on time, on budget and deliver even more than you promised," said Moody's analyst Russell Solomon, who covers the aerospace and defense industry. The CEOs from Lockheed and Boeing have met separately with Trump in an attempt to allay his concerns about certain contracts. Trump has criticized Lockheed's F-35 stealth fighter program, including during his Jan. 11 press conference when he said the F-35 is "way, way behind schedule and many, many billions of dollars over budget." Lockheed stock slid as much as 1.8 percent the day he took the swipe — and it wasn't his first time going after the aircraft. Indeed, Trump's first slap at the F-35 was tweeted on Dec. 12, when he lashed out at the program's "out of control costs." Lockheed shares slidmore than 4 percent in early trading that day. As for Boeing, Trump tweeted Dec. 6 about its new 747 Air Force One aircraft: "costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order." Boeing stock fell as much as 1 percent in premarket trading that day but did manage to recover. Given Trump's eagle eye for defense program spending, there is a possibility of new acquisition reform inside the Pentagon, and that could hurt contractor profitability. "We think President Trump will continue to be outspoken on better pricing for defense programs with cost overruns, publicly encouraging companies involved to cut costs," Credit Suisse said in a research note Thursday. "While this greater emphasis on cost controls could result in a temporary dislocation of share prices, it is still very unclear how effective a Trump administration could be at reforming the acquisition process and adversely impact pricing and margins on certain programs. Even if there is some success on this front, it likely would not flow through to contractor financial results for some time." There also are other reasons to be positive about the sector, according to analysts. "Our DC discussions reaffirmed our view that there is strong consensus for higher levels of defense spending, although the mechanics to undo sequestration (Budget Control Act) are still to be determined," UBS analyst David Strauss said in a note Wednesday. Analysts say obsolescence with some of the older equipment in the military arsenal is driving a portion of future spending as well as Trump's overall pledge to rebuild the armed forces. "In the last defense spending cycle, I think we underinvested," said Richard Safran, Buckingham Research Group director of equity research. "We're playing a little catch-up ball in this spending cycle." Safran expects the sequestration budget caps will be repealed to help fund some of the increased defense spending. Trump has already said he will ask Congress to do just that. Overseas demand strong Another positive trend for the American defense contractors is that overseas demand remains strong for missile systems, aircraft, radar technology and other military hardware. "Geopolitical risk is certainly not slowing," said Moody's Solomon, pointing to the Middle East, Europe and Asia/Pacific markets. In the case of Europe, NATO allies are under pressure to do more burden sharing of defense while also spending more to combat terrorism. For Lockheed, the company has seen growing demand internationally for its defensive technology, including its Aegis naval weapons system in Japan and South Korea, while its THAAD missile defense systems are of interest in countries like Qatar and Saudi Arabia. Lockheed first out of the gate Lockheed is scheduled to report fourth-quarter earnings on Tuesday, making it the first of the five major defense primes out of the gate. The world's largest defense contractor has beaten the Street on earnings per share in all but two of the last 15 quarters, according to FactSet. Analysts expect the company to report earnings of $3.05 a share on revenue of $13.03 billion, according to Thomson Reuters. Trump's comments on the F-35's costs add to uncertainties for Lockheed and are likely to be a key topic on the minds of investors during the company's earnings call. Trump has mentioned that Boeing's fourth-generation F-18 Super Hornet fighter jet could be used as an alternative to the F-35, a fifth-generation stealth fighter. Lockheed is the main contractor on the F-35. Other companies participating in the program include Northrop Grumman and United Technologies' Pratt & Whitney business. The program is forecast to cost the Pentagon upwards of $1 trillion over its 55-year life. The first F-35 delivery of 2017 was the 200th overall delivery and made to Japan, one of the original nine partner nations buying the aircraft. Israel, which is buying 50 of the fighters, received its first deliveries in December. Besides its exposure to the F-35 fighter, Northrop also has the B-21 Raider, a long-range strike bomber program. So far, the B-21 program, which could cost upwards of $80 billion, has been spared Trump's cost-cutting crusade. Northrop is scheduled to announce its December quarter earnings on Thursday — the same day Raytheon is set to report. Northrop's EPS is forecast to be slightly above a year ago and consensus has been trending higher in the past 90 days. Guidance for 2017 also is expected be provided on the earnings call. According to Thomson Reuters, Northrop is expected to post earnings of $2.49 a share on revenue of $5.93 billion. As for Raytheon, it has reported surprise upside earnings in 11 of the last 12 quarters and its strong international business should boost its fourth-quarter results. There also remains strong demand globally going forward for its air and missile defense systems such as the Patriot, radar surveillance as well as its encryption devices and cybersecurity solutions. According to Thomson Reuters, Raytheon is expected to report earnings of $1.86 a share on revenue of $6.56 billion. Commercial planes could ding Boeing earnings Boeing's fourth-quarter results are scheduled for Wednesday. Consensus EPS for the December quarter has been trending lower in the past 90 days. Analysts now expect the company to report $2.35 a share earnings on revenue of $23.19 billion, Thomson Reuters said. Boeing's international military business could see a boost in the quarter as the U.S. government late last year approved two major foreign aircraft deals together valued at more than $30 billion. Even so, Boeing is seeing weaker-than-expected orders in its commercial airplane business, due in part to more competition from Airbus. Boeing has said it plans to reduce the commercial side's spending in 2017, and that includes job cuts. Jeff DanielsCoordinating Producer Related Securities Symbol Price   Change %Change LMT ---

Carolina workers By Reuters Published: 10:54 EST, 20 January 2017 | Updated: 10:54 EST, 20 January 2017 e-mail By Alwyn Scott and Ankit Ajmera SEATTLE, Jan 20 (Reuters) - The International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers said it planned to petition on Friday for about 2,850 workers at Boeing Co's assembly plant in South Carolina to vote on union representation. The petition with the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), which had been expected, likely would allow workers to hold a secret-ballot election in the next few months. On average, votes take place about three weeks after a petition is filed, IAM spokesman Mike Evans said. The union called off a vote in April 2015 after what it called "political interference" from state lawmakers and "misinformation" spread among workers. The union, in a regulatory filing on Friday, said it sought to address concerns about "subjective raises, inconsistent scheduling policies and a lack of respect on the shop floor." Evans said the union was convinced workers were ready to vote for a union and that an election would be held this year. Boeing said on Friday that a union was not in the "best interest" of its workers in South Carolina. "We believe our teammates deserve to keep their hard-earned money in their pockets while continuing to work with the company to drive meaningful change," Joan Robinson-Berry, Boeing vice president and general manager, South Carolina, said in a statement. South Carolina is a right-to-work state where employees can't be forced to join a union or pay dues even when covered by a union contract. In April 2015, it had the second-lowest union membership in the United States. Boeing's workforce at its main commercial aircraft factories in Washington state is largely unionized. The South Carolina plant, which opened in 2011, makes 787 Dreamliners and is the only Boeing jetliner assembly line outside of Washington state. It is the sole producer of the 787-10, Boeing's largest Dreamliner. The first 787-10 is currently being assembled in South Carolina. It is due for its first flight this year, and the first customer delivery is expected in 2018.

Workers have remained in contact with IAM organizers in recent months regarding numerous workplace concerns that remain unaddressed, including subjective raises, inconsistent scheduling policies and a lack of respect on the shop floor.   “Boeing workers just want to be treated with the respect they deserve,” said IAM Boeing SC Lead Organizer Mike Evans. “Why should they be subject to a different set of standards and rules than folks building the exact same plane in Seattle?” The filing comes after the IAM was forced to postpone a scheduled April 22, 2015 union election due to unprecedented political interference on the part of South Carolina lawmakers and the rampant spread of misinformation among Boeing workers.  “It was impossible to hold a free and fair election in an environment so ripe with mistruths and outright lies. Unfortunately, we’ve now heard numerous reports of the company walking people off the job for seeking a voice,” said Evans. “Despite the obstacles, we feel this group is ready to take a stand. The only way to secure the workplace improvements they deserve is through a union-negotiated collective bargaining agreement.” The NLRB is expected to issue election dates and locations in the coming weeks. The IAM is committed to ensuring Boeing workers have the opportunity to make their voice heard in an atmosphere free of intimidation and harassment. “I can unequivocally say there will be a vote this time around,” said Evans. “We’ve met with numerous workers at Boeing in recent months and are confident they will see through any attempts by the company to divert attention away from the numerous workplace issues that need fixed.” The IAM is the U.S.’s largest aerospace union, representing approximately 600,000 members at the likes of Lockheed Martin, General Electric and United Technologies. The IAM represents more than 35,000 Boeing employees at 24 locations nationwide. For more information about the campaign visit BoeingWorkers.com.

But until after World War II, that was part of the oath sworn by members of the International Association of Machinists union, which represented Boeing workers in the Puget Sound region. The union, which organized the Boeing workforce in the region in 1935, was hardly the sole barrier to racial integration at Boeing. From the company’s founding in 1916, management had not hired a single black person. Prewar, such employment bans were pervasive throughout U.S. industry, even in the greater Seattle region — now one of the country’s most politically liberal. Boeing hired its first two black Rosie the Riveter-types in 1942 to build bombers for the war effort — more than nine months after a presidential order banning discrimination at defense companies — and afterward progressed only slowly toward equality. Interviews with current and former employees trace a difficult journey spanning 75 years from the reluctant hiring of those black Rosies through today — when young African-Americans can take advantage of Boeing’s official policy encouraging diversity and equal opportunity. (Boeing declined to share the racial demographics of its current workforce.) In recent years a handful of African-Americans have risen to prominent positions in the company. Joan Robinson-Berry held various engineering and supplier management roles at Boeing and now heads the company’s growing Charleston, S.C., complex. The highly regarded former chief financial officer James Bell in 2005 served for four months as Boeing’s interim chief executive after a scandal ousted his boss. Marc Allen, president of Boeing International, is widely viewed as a possible future chief executive. Yet even now, with race remaining a divisive issue in America, some black employees find the workplace reality at Boeing still falls short of the colorblind ideal. ——— Even as World War II approached and the nation began a rapid buildup of defense workers, Boeing management resisted a federal edict to cease discrimination, according to Battle at Boeing, a Seattle Civil Rights and Labor History project at the University of Washington. In the fall of 1940, Thurgood Marshall, then a lawyer for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and later a Supreme Court justice, wrote to the Seattle branch of the organization noting that Boeing had just been granted a $7 million government bomber contract. Marshall encouraged the local branch to push for the hiring of blacks. After black leaders threatened to bring thousands of protesters to the White House in April 1941, President Franklin Roosevelt issued an executive order requiring companies with government contracts to cease racial discrimination. Local activists in Seattle mounted an intense public campaign to have Boeing comply with the order. Yet in the following months, although Boeing was hiring 1,000 people a week, none of them were African-Americans. That July, in a letter to the NAACP’s Washington state branch, Boeing personnel manager Paul Fredrickson conveniently ignored the company’s pre-International Association of Machinists history of never hiring African-Americans and put the blame entirely on the union, often called the IAM. He cited the closed-shop bargaining agreement with the IAM’s Local 751 and pointed out that “only those of the Caucasian race are acceptable” to the union. By 1942, the needs of the war effort finally forced a management reversal and African-Americans, mostly women at first, were hired. The union only reluctantly acceded, according to Seattle’s African-American newspaper at the time, Northwest Enterprise. “We rather resent that the war situation has been used to alter an old established custom,” IAM representative James Duncan said. The African-Americans that Boeing hired were required to pay for special temporary “work permits” that cost more than union dues, allowing them to work even though they were still barred from the union. By 1944, about 1,600 blacks worked at Boeing locally, in a workforce of nearly 43,000 that was churning out B-17 bombers at phenomenal rates. Defense hiring at Boeing and at Puget Sound shipyards brought an influx of African-Americans to the region, mostly from the South. According to a history of Seattle race relations by Howard Droker, Seattle’s black population doubled between 1940 and 1944 to about 8,000. The racist clause in the IAM oath was removed in 1946, after the war. Only then did Boeing truly begin to open up to African-Americans. ——— Lou Annie Charles, now 94, was one of those early black Rosies. She still lives in her Seattle home, paid for, in large part, by her long career at Boeing. Born in Muskogee, Okla., she was raised on a farm where she picked cotton and grew vegetables. Charles trained as a riveter in the early 1940s under a New Deal program and was hired in 1943 to work for 60 cents an hour at Boeing’s airplane plant in Wichita, Kan., where she assembled B-29 Superfortress bombers. “It gave me an opportunity to help my parents,” Charles said. “I sent money home. That was a good feeling, to have money to help them.” After the war, when Charles and many other Wichita workers were laid off, she moved to Seattle, where the company rehired her in 1950. At the old Plant 2 in Seattle and later in the nearby cities of Renton and Everett, Charles worked at Boeing for another 38 years until her retirement in 1988. “I did nothing but rivet,” she said. “I enjoyed it.” The Boeing job allowed her to buy her home in 1956 — a time when Seattle’s Central District was the only neighborhood open to black people for homeownership — and to put her two children through college. Her daughter became an airline flight attendant, her son a police officer and later an attorney. Recalling her early days working at Boeing, Charles said she met very little racial bias. “Most of the time, I’d be the only black woman in the shop,” she said. “I never had any problem with anyone not wanting to work with me.” She got on well with her workmates, though she said some of her supervisors were prejudiced and “not too nice.” Charles recalls her working life at Boeing fondly and still sends Christmas cards to the remaining members of her old crew. Omar Abdul-Alim, 50, joined Boeing in 1989 after leaving the Army. He works as a mechanic in Renton, pressurizing 737 fuel tanks to test the seals before the planes roll out. Abdul-Alim is a double minority: An African-American, he grew up Baptist, then converted to Islam at age 30. In 2000, he married a Somali immigrant and is active today at a mosque popular with the Somali community. He’s grateful that the job at Boeing has given him what it gave generations of local workers without a college degree: the chance to earn good money and create a comfortable middle-class life. Some of the African-American males he hung around with as a youngster sank into lives of drugs and prison. “A few of us were able to escape,” Abdul-Alim said. “I and a few of my friends, we’ve been the blessed ones.” Yet management actions have recently soured his view of Boeing. “It’s not the same company we hired into,” Abdul-Alim said, a common lament among Boeing veterans of every skin color since the last contract froze their pensions. A forceful personality, he said he won’t put up with disrespect on matters of race or religion, whether it comes from a Somali immigrant treating him as an outsider or from a prejudiced white American. “There are people who are ignorant,” Abdul-Alim said. “But I have a thick skin. I have no problem defending myself.” ——— For LaDonna Perkins, 25, who next month will complete two years as an engineer at Boeing, the experience so far has been entirely positive, full of openness, encouragement and possibility. She grew up in the small city of Wetumpka, Ala., The daughter of a clothing-factory worker and a carpenter, she’s the first in her immediate family to go to college. Perkins did two summer internships at Boeing before being hired full time. She now works in Renton in the cabin-interiors unit, as a project manager working on an airplane lavatory-lighting system. Of about 50 engineers who graduated with her from the University of Alabama, six were black and three were women. Although she’s the only woman in her five-person work group at Boeing, the larger organization of some 120 people that she’s part of has about 10 percent African-Americans, she estimates. “I was very surprised. On my first day at work, I saw three African-American women in my first group,” Perkins said. “In the interiors organization we do have a really diverse group, different people of color and from different countries.” She hasn’t come across any bias. “I grew up in Alabama. I’ve seen prejudice,” she said. “I haven’t experienced that at Boeing.” The encouragement of her manager “pushed me to think of all the things I can do at Boeing,” she said, and she’s taken advantage of Boeing-sponsored courses in professional development and technical matters. She also attended a company diversity conference in California with about 900 employees from all over the country, where she met chief executive Dennis Muilenburg and several vice presidents. “The culture at Boeing is very inclusive,” Perkins said. She’s become an evangelist for engineering and for Boeing to people back home in Wetumpka. “I’ve had a couple of people Facebook message me asking what are the steps to become an engineer,” Perkins said. In 10 years, she said, her goal is to be a Boeing vice president herself. Previous Article Next Article Loading comment count... Commenting is closed.

CTT will be tier-1 supplier to Boeing and the CTT products will be offered as supplier furnished equipment in the 777X catalogue. Selecting CTT enables Boeing to bring proven humidification capabilities and performance from the 787 to the 777X and migrate to premium passenger cabins (zone A and B). In total, the Boeing 777X aircraft can be equipped with five of our humidifiers. "We are honoured that Boeing has selected CTT for another widebody program. This is a major win for CTT, building on our experiences on the 787," said Torbjörn Johansson, CEO of CTT Systems. "The demand for humidification is proven on the787 with a flight deck humidifier fleet selection close to 80 percent and I am convinced that this extended offering will be well received by airlines." The 777X will be the largest and most efficient twin-engine jet in the world, with 12 percent lower fuel consumption and 10 percent lower operating costs than the competition. "I strongly believe that the 777X award with five optional humidifiers per aircraft has a great chance to rival the 787 Dreamliner average shipset content of approx. 2 humidifiers per aircraft," comments Torbjörn Johansson, CEO of CTT Systems. CTT's humidifier maintains relative humidity in the human comfort zone of approx. 20 percent Relative Humidity. A higher humidity on long-haul flights reduces dry air related problems (e.g. fatigue, jet-lag, red eyes, dry skin, spread of virus diseases) and improves wellbeing and sleep. The humidifier is based on evaporative cooling technology and uses a method that effectively precludes the transfer of bacteria. About CTT SYSTEMS (www.ctt.se)  CTT Systems is the market leading provider of humidity control systems for aircraft. Our products are offered for retrofit installations and line-fit on A380, A350 and Boeing 787.

Boeing aircraft and U.S. soybeans may be among U.S. goods targeted by China if bilateral trade tensions escalate and Beijing retaliates against U.S. tariffs threatened by president-elect Donald Trump's administration. Capital goods - including aircraft manufactured by Boeing, turbines for power generation and transportation equipment - are an 'obvious candidate' for retaliation, wrote Eurasia Group analysts Evan Madeiros and Michael Hirson in a report on January 18. "Beijing will target sectors it believes will resonate politically with the Trump team, including sectors that touch Trump's political base," the analysts wrote. Beijing would approach alternative suppliers in Latin America for agricultural goods and in Europe for commercial aircraft should trade relations with the U.S. sour, former U.S. ambassador to China Gary Locke told CNBC on Friday. "Chinese airlines do not have to buy Boeing planes, they can buy Airbus," Locke said. "The list goes on and on, and that will cost American jobs, good paying jobs." show chapters In US-China trade war, both sides lose: Former ambassador    Thursday, 19 Jan 2017 | 8:00 PM ET | 02:07 Steven R. Okun, director of public affairs at the American Chamber in Commerce in Singapore said U.S. businesses exposed to China will lobby hard against a hawkish position on trade, arguing it would threaten, not protect U.S. jobs. "Every company should be doing something to show what the tie-ins are between trade and job growth in the U.S.," Okun said. "When I was at UPS, we did an economic study showing access to China increased employment in the U.S. For every 40 daily international packages processed in the UPS system, that would create another incremental UPS job, most likely in the U.S.," Okun said. Okun added: "If you want to make in and hire in America, you've got to sell America outside the borders as well." If that message fails to resonate, U.S. agricultural exports to China may be in the firing line should a protectionist rhetoric spiral into an outright trade war. China may have already taken pre-emptive action. Beijing increased punitive tariffs on January 12th on imports of a U.S. animal feed ingredient known as distillers' dried grains (DDGS) from levels first proposed last year. China accounts for over 50% of U.S. DDGs exports and annual exports are worth $2 billion. show chapters President of the USA isn't all-powerful: Expert    Thursday, 19 Jan 2017 | 9:28 PM ET | 01:54 "DDGs (prepared animal food) fall right into the sectors we highlighted as potential retaliation targets by China, should the U.S. initiate a trade war," Deutsche Bank's chief China economist Zhiwei Zhang wrote in a report a day after China increased the tariffs. Though Deutsche said it viewed a large-scale U.S.-China trade war "as a risk scenario," the bank said there were "indications that the chance of such risk materializing is on the rise." Ultimately, many believe there is far too much at stake in Asia's growing economies for the U.S. not to be engaged in the region. "Asia's throwing a growth party here and the U.S. can come and attend if it wants," said DBS chief economist David Carbon. "It's not really going to be a lot of skin off Xi Jinping's nose if the U.S. doesn't," Carbon said. Follow CNBC International on Twitter and Facebook.

Area IV, which is part of the 80 percent of the field lab belonging to Boeing Co., was the site of a partial nuclear meltdown in 1959. The federal government owns the remaining 20 percent of the 2,850-acre field lab in the hills of Simi Valley. In a draft environmental impact statement released Jan. 6, the DOE outlines several goals: demolish and remove 18 structures in Area IV; remediate chemically contaminated soil and groundwater in Area IV and a buffer zone to the north; and restore the environment. The statement suggests multiple alternatives to address each goal. For example, one option for dealing with contaminated soil is to clean the area to background standards, meaning all unnatural material is removed. The other two options involve varying degrees of clearing out any soil that has been contaminated by certain chemicals affecting human health, said John Jones, DOE spokesperson. With regard to groundwater, one alternative is to install wells and simply monitor the natural degradation of chemicals, while another option calls for treating the groundwater. Jones said all the alternatives follow the 2010 cleanup agreement signed by the DOE, Department of Toxic Substances Control, NASA and Boeing, all of which are responsible for cleaning up portions of the field lab. “We’re really happy to finally get this (statement) out,” Jones said. “It really is a culmination of years of study (that) helps us understand the environmental impacts . . . and evaluate what we have to do moving forward.” Denise Duffield, an activist lobbying for complete cleanup of SSFL to background standards, argues that the DOE’s statement breaks its commitment to clean all detectable contamination as outlined in the 2010 agreement. “None of these (options) are anywhere near sufficiently protective of public health,” Duffield said. “All will result in dangerous . . . and toxic chemicals remaining on the site where they can continue to migrate off-site and impact nearby communities.” Duffield asserts any of the options would still leave 34 to 94 percent of contamination on-site. “DOE has essentially green-washed the (environmental impact statement) by claiming that a protective cleanup poses undue harm to the environment and that the contamination poses little risk.” Jones said he does not agree with Duffield’s assertions when it comes to potential contamination left behind. DOE’s statement estimates that 1.4 million cubic yards of soil will potentially have to be removed from the site, he said. But, state and federal laws protecting endangered species has reduced that number to about 1 million cubic yards. “I don’t think (Duffield) understands what those numbers are saying,” Jones said. “Those exceptions are identified in the (2010 agreement). It says we will protect endangered species, and that’s what this does. “All these alternatives are protective of human health and the environment. That is really the essence of all these alternatives. (The statement) doesn’t in any way go against our mission, which in the end is to protect public health and the environment.” Jones said the DOE will hold public hearings on Feb. 18 and Feb. 21 to garner community feedback on the informational report, which is a crucial step in getting to a final cleanup document. The 2,850-acre field lab has been used since 1947 as a nuclear test site and for research in the development of ballistic missiles, rockets and space shuttle equipment. Cleanup at the site began in 2010, with NASA overseeing the federal government’s portion, and the DOE and DTSC managing Boeing’s portion.

The Wichita, Kansas-based maker of aerospace components notified workers in December that the supply chain work "could possibly be sub-contracted in the near future," according to a letter seen by Reuters. One source said Spirit was considering outsourcing the jobs to a company in India. Donald Trump, who will be sworn in as U.S. president on Friday, has repeatedly criticized U.S. companies for not doing more to keep manufacturing jobs in the United States and has threatened "retribution or consequences" for companies that move operations out of the country. The jobs Spirit is considering moving are not manufacturing positions. Spirit confirmed that it had asked outside vendors about their capabilities and interest in bidding to handle purchase-order administration. It also has asked the union representing the potentially affected workers for a plan to keep the jobs where they are while saving up to $7 million a year. Spirit said no decision has been made to move forward with the plan. As a major supplier, Spirit builds 42 fuselages a month for Boeing 737 planes, and makes parts for other Boeing and Airbus jetliners. Spirit also supplies parts to major defense contractors such as Boeing, Northrop Grumman Corp and Lockheed Martin Corp's Sikorsky unit. Spirit's shares closed up 1 percent at $57.25. Spirit spokesman Jarrod Bartlett said it was the first time the company, which was spun off from Boeing in 2005, had considering moving supply chain jobs. "It's too soon to speculate" on potential supply chain risks from the move or the future location of the work, he added. The jobs involved "executing back-end work on supply agreements" on all company purchases, he said, including raw materials such as aluminum and titanium, parts and components and office supplies. The work of negotiating supplier agreements, managing supplier performance and choosing suppliers is not part of its study of moving purchase-order work, he said. Outsourcing to a foreign company could complicate Spirit's defense work, and runs counter to the trend at some defense firms, said Franklin Turner, a Washington, D.C.-based lawyer at McCarter & English who represents prime contractors and sub-contractors in the supply chain. "It's a reality of globalization that companies are trying to find the cheapest rates to get work done," he said. But "companies I deal with are shying away from that practice. Anytime something like that is performed outside the United States, there's an increased risk to the integrity of the operation." Aerospace companies and other manufacturers carefully manage their supply chains to keep assembly lines running. Any hiccup in the millions of pieces Spirit handles potentially threatens production of finished Boeing and Airbus aircraft. Spirit has a history of on-time delivery, but other suppliers have caused costly factory delays at Boeing and Airbus in recent years. "Spirit is operating in an extremely competitive global marketplace, and we are always looking for ways to improve efficiencies and provide value to our customers," Spirit said in its statement. In the letter, Spirit said workers had 60 days to offer an alternative plan that could save $5 million to $7 million per year. The union representing the workers, the Society of Professional Engineering Employees in Aerospace, declined to comment.

news tech spaceflight science & astronomy search for life skywatching entertainment video news tech spaceflight science & astronomy search for life skywatching entertainment video news tech spaceflight science & astronomy search for life skywatching entertainment video Space.com Spaceflight NASA Considering Boeing Offer for Additional Soyuz Seats By Jeff Foust, SpaceNews Writer | January 18, 2017 02:45pm ET MORE A Soyuz spacecraft being prepared for launch last fall. NASA is considering a Boeing proposal to purchase additional seats on Soyuz missions, including options for seats on 2019 flights to back up commercial crew providers. Credit: NASA/Victor Zelentsov WASHINGTON — NASA is proposing to purchase, through Boeing, additional Soyuz seats for International Space Station missions to both take advantage of Russian plans to decrease the size of its crew and as insurance against potential additional commercial crew delays. In a "sources sought" procurement filing Jan. 17, NASA said it isconsidering plans to acquire from Boeing two Soyuz seats on missions to the ISS in the fall of 2017 and the spring of 2018, and options for three additional Soyuz seats in 2019. Boeing, the filing stated, had obtained the rights to the seats from Soyuz manufacturer RSC Energia. The two near-term seats take advantage of seats the Russians are vacating as a cost-saving measure. Roscosmos, the Russian state space corporation, announced in September it was reducing its crew on the ISS from three to two, starting in March and until the launch of a new laboratory module, expected some time in 2018. At the time, Roscosmos had no firm plans to make use of the seats on Soyuz spacecraft freed up by the decision to reduce its crew, but suggested it would make the seats available to the other ISS partners. "We discussed with our partners to maybe use this free seat for them," Igor Komarov, head of Roscosmos, said at the International Astronautical Congress in September. "We expect some interest from that side." The workhorse Soyuz spacecraft have been flying for nearly 45 years. See how Russia's Soyuz spacecraft work in this Space.com infographic. Credit: Karl Tate, SPACE.com Contributor Boeing gained access to the seats as part of an agreement with Energia to settle a legal dispute regarding Sea Launch. Boeing won a judgment of more than $320 million against Energia from a federal court in May 2016, but subsequent legal filings indicated that the two companies were negotiating a settlement. "We got together with Energia and discussed what in-kind things that we could perhaps put on the table that might offset this debt," John Elbon, vice president and general manager of space exploration at Boeing, said in a Jan. 17 interview. Part of the broader agreement between the two companies included rights to the Soyuz seats, but he said specific details of the settlement agreement between the companies were proprietary. Elbon said that Boeing then decided to offer the seats to NASA in an unsolicited proposal to the agency. "They have expressed some interest" in the proposal, he said, leading to the sources sought filing. "We'll go through the process and figure out if there's an opportunity for us to make a deal." The near-term seats will allow NASA to add an additional crewmember to the U.S. segment of the station, which the agency was already planning to do once commercial crew vehicles under development by Boeing and SpaceX enter service. "Adding an extra U.S. crewmember in 2017 and 2018 will really help with the utilization on board and getting more hours for science," Elbon said. What's attracted more attention among industry observers is the option for the three additional seats on two Soyuz flights in the spring of 2019. NASA's current contract with Roscosmos for regular crew transportation services to and from the ISS runs through 2018, at which time the agency expects either or both commercial crew companies to take over. Both Boeing and SpaceX, though, have experienced delays with their vehicles that pushed back test flights until as late as mid-2018. That's raised questions about whether their vehicles would be ready in time to start providing flights in 2019 should they experience additional issues. "Although both commercial crew vehicles are on track right now to start flying in 2019, it seemed to us it might make sense to NASA to have some insurance just in case," Elbon said, noting there are uncertainties inherent in any development program. "Some insurance or backstop in 2019 seemed like it might be prudent." NASA officials previous indicated that there were no plans by the agency to purchase additional Soyuz seats directly from Roscosmos. William Gerstenmaier, NASA associate administrator for human exploration and operations, said in an October interview that the deadline had passed for NASA to purchase additional Soyuz seats from Roscosmos for 2019 missions. NASA Associate Administrator Robert Lightfoot, who will become acting administrator Jan. 20, did not mention the proposed Soyuz purchase during a Jan. 17 speech at a Maryland Space Business Roundtable luncheon in Greenbelt, Maryland. However, he said he believed the two companies developing commercial crew vehicles would be ready for flights in 2018 despite technical challenges. "We're continuing great development on the commercial crew program. We're going to hopefully return flights of U.S. astronauts from U.S. soil here in 2018," he said. "They're running into what I would call the standard challenges that you're going to run into when you're trying to develop a spacecraft, and so we're working through that." The sources sought statement indicates that NASA has until the fall of 2017 to decide whether to exercise the option for the 2019 seats, which could also be used in parallel with commercial crew missions "to maximize research onboard the ISS." Elbon said Boeing agreement with Energia includes provisions should NASA decide not to purchase the 2019 seats, but he could not disclose those details. Elbon said he expects NASA to make enter into negotiations with Boeing about the 2017 and 2018 seats shortly after a Jan. 27 deadline for companies to respond to the sources sought statement, a requirement when a government agency proposes a sole-source procurement. "Assuming that goes well, I think we would sit down and, in relatively short order, negotiate the details of this kind of arrangement," he said. He didn't specify how much Boeing was proposing to charge NASA for the seats. The agency announced an agreement with Roscosmos in August 2015 for six Soyuz seats in 2018 at a total cost of $490 million, or $81.7 million per seat. "It's a good value for NASA and the taxpayer," Elbon said of Boeing's proposed deal with NASA. "We wouldn't ask them to pay more than they would have been paying before."

Chicago - Jan. 25, 2017   Beachwood Politics Our monthly archive. Who We Are Chicago by the numbers. Sausage Links Wiki Daley Wiki Rahm Illinois Channel CAN TV Ralph Martire Doonesbury Government Attic Division Street Indie Political Report The Obameter ProPublica The Intercept SCOTUS Blog American Dream Betrayed State Tax Incentives To Corporations Don't Work By Joshua Jansa/The Conversation In late November, President-elect Donald Trump announced that he had reached a deal with Carrier to keep about 800 manufacturing jobs in Indiana from moving to Mexico. After the announcement, we learned that the Indiana Economic Development Corporation would give $7 million in tax credits and grants to Carrier's parent company in exchange for keeping the jobs in the state. Trump proudly praised the agreement as a "great deal for workers" and said that it was part of a larger approach to keep jobs at home, saying that "This is the way it's going to be." Having the chief executive of the United States negotiate individualized deals with corporations is certainly a new approach to economic policy nationally, though it is not without precedent. In fact, state governments have been negotiating targeted incentives with corporations for decades. My research focuses on why states use incentives to attract and retain investment from corporations and whether they are effective. My work, as well as that of many others, shows that these deals do not create the jobs and economic growth they are purported to. Evan Vucci/AP Every year, states spend billions of dollars to entice companies to create jobs within their borders. These inducements include some combination of property, sales and income tax credits and rebates, tax abatements, cash grants and cost reimbursements. The deals are meant to reduce costs for the businesses that receive them in order to encourage their investment and job growth in a particular location. The most prominent packages usually grab headlines nationally. In 2013, for example, Chicago-based Boeing received $8.7 billion in tax breaks from Washington state to secure the production of the 777x. This record-breaking package came shortly after Boeing had received $900 million from South Carolina for opening a new 787 assembly plant in Charleston. Other examples include Tesla receiving $1.3 billion from Nevada in 2014 to subsidize a battery factory outside Reno, and the Los Angeles Rams collecting $180 million in sales tax revenue from Inglewood for relocating there from St. Louis this year. Just as Carrier threatened to move jobs to Mexico and promptly received a tax break, so too did Sears receive millions from Illinois to keep its headquarters in Chicago back in 1989. From 1984 to 2012, incentive spending increased in the states from about $500 million per year to about $13 billion per year, according to spending data gathered by the Good Jobs First Subsidy Tracker. Does it work? No. Despite the hundreds of billions of dollars in incentives thrown their way, many companies have still decided to move more manufacturing jobs and corporate headquarters overseas. This is because corporations consider many other factors when making decisions about where to build a factory or establish a tax home. In a 2016 survey, incentives lagged behind skilled labor, labor costs, highway access, corporate tax rates, available buildings, construction costs, proximity to markets and quality of life as important factors for location decisions. For example, scholars have found that the Sun Belt has been able to attract investment away from the Rust Belt because it has lower wages but similar access to the interstate highway system. In other words, jobs move (or don't) based on the overall range of costs facing employers, which are determined by larger economic trends and policies and not necessarily by individually negotiated deals. When subsidies do matter is when corporations are choosing between equally strong locations. In those situations, incentives serve as "deal sweeteners" but don't change the fundamental reasons for why the location was considered in the first place. In light of the realities of corporate location decisions, there is scant evidence to support the arguments that targeted incentives produce economic growth. Rather, the evidence shows that they tend to fail to achieve their intended goals. Often, subsidies fall short of job creation targets and fail to create growth, even if they retain jobs. As University of Iowa scholars Alan Peters and Peter Fisher argue, based on a review of several studies of their impact, "incentives work about 10 percent of the time and are simply a waste of money the other 90 percent." One reason why scholars have struggled to measure the impact of incentives is because of the complexity of the economy. Economic growth is affected mostly by national and international forces. State economic development strategies have little effect when compared with broad national economic policies. Subsidies still can have an effect on economic behavior, just not in the way they were intended, such as by encouraging rent-seeking. Critics of the Carrier deal have already noted that Trump may have opened the federal government up to increased threats from companies to move overseas unless they receive more incentives. In the days following the Carrier deal, Ford Motor (already one of the largest recipients of state-level spending) expressed a willingness to make a deal with Trump to retain jobs scheduled to move overseas. In a first move, Ford announced that it had canceled a planned investment in Mexico and will instead invest $700 million in its Flat Rock, Michigan plant. There is also some evidence that incentives can exacerbate economic inequality. Incentives, when used to influence location decisions, tend to be awarded to the largest and wealthiest corporations. These corporations need the money the least of all businesses and usually receive the money for making investments they likely would have made anyway in order to remain competitive. The result is that fewer resources are available for education, workforce training and social services. As a result, the gap between rich and poor tends to grow. Finally, Trump would need to negotiate several packages per week in order to have a noticeable effect on the U.S. economy. While it is laudable that several hundred Indianans get to celebrate their secure jobs, evidence from the states raises red flags on the viability of targeted incentives as a national policy for growth.

It is noted that on January 19 flight recorders from the aircraft "Boeing 747-412" TC-MCL of MyCARGO airline (Turkey), crashed at the airport in Bishkek, were delivered at the Interstate Aviation Committee. "Recorders have significant mechanical damage and traces of the extremely high temperatures. In connection with this it was impossible to reproduce information in regular way," the statement said. IAC experts together with specialists from Turkey, the United States and Kyrgyzstan examined, opened and removed memory modules from drive. The reconstruction of the data carrier interface of parametric recorder is completed. Information read. Preliminary analysis showed that information about the accident is available. The Commission continues to work on the site of the accident.  URL: http://www.eng.24.kg/community/183821-news24.html printable version      ��������    ��������   RELATED MATERIALS Exchange rate from 27 January National Bank of Kyrgyz Republic USD 69.4238 EUR 74.5612 RUB 1.1641 KZT 0.2116 UZS 0.0214 Weighted average exchange rate of som on January 26 USD 69.2400 Weather forecast 28.01.2017   night day Bishkek -10...-5 -2...+1 Talas -4...+2 +2...+5 Jalal-Abad -8...-5 -3...+2 Osh -12...-4 -5...+2 Batken -8...-2 -3...+3 Naryn -20...-16 -12...-6 Cholpon-Ata -10...-7 -4...0 GLANCE Doctors silenced.

Carolina plant By Dominic Gates, The Seattle Times Published: January 20, 2017, 3:58 PM A   A The Machinists union announced Friday that it will file for a new vote to organize production workers at Boeing’s manufacturing complex in North Charleston, S.C., according to a person familiar with the plans. Detailed arrangements for the vote among roughly 3,000 eligible workers must be agreed on by the union and company through the National Labor Relations Board, a process that typically takes three to five weeks. The union filing will trigger a fresh wave of impassioned propaganda from both the International Association of Machinists and Boeing as each tries to sway the workforce during the run-up to the vote. The union had indicated in November that a vote would come soon and that it expects this time to be successful after a failed attempt to organize in 2015. In anticipation of the IAM announcement, Boeing issued a statement Thursday suggesting that the union’s primary focus is preserving jobs in the Puget Sound region, not North Charleston. “We’ve said consistently over the past several years, and we continue to believe, that a union is not in the best interest of our teammates, our business, our community or our state,” Boeing said. “Our position has not changed.” Boeing sent mailings to the homes of its South Carolina employees in November aimed at convincing them to resist the union’s overtures. However, the IAM’s move to file for a vote indicates it has managed to get more than 30 percent of the workers to sign cards requesting union representation. The union called a previous vote in March 2015, but canceled it a month later before the vote actually took place when it sensed a lack of majority support. It’s likely union officials wouldn’t file again now unless feedback from workers has given them more confidence about the outcome. With President Donald Trump taking office on the same day as the IAM announcement, the vote in South Carolina will likely stoke political fires. Trump will immediately be able to appoint two new members to the NLRB, which could mark a shift in future rulings. The labor-secretary nominee — Andrew Puzder, chief executive of CKE Restaurants, which owns the Hardee’s and Carl’s Jr. restaurant chains — has been critical of the NLRB. And South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, a fierce opponent of the IAM organizing Boeing, will also be a Cabinet member as Trump’s ambassador to the United Nations. The total workforce at Boeing South Carolina now stands at just over 7,600 people, down more than 600 jobs since the peak last March.

Here’s how stocks have reacted in the wake of Trump’s negative tweets. By Abby Schultz Jan. 20, 2017 3:36 p.m. ET Text Size Regular Medium Large President Donald Trump delivering his inaugural address in Washington, D.C. Photo: Getty Images It’s inauguration day and time for investors to get real about the new president. Donald Trump taking office as the United States’ 45th president means looking out for actual policy proposals. And yet investors can’t quite ignore those early morning tweets from the new president. While most U.S. presidents steer clear of influencing specific stocks, Trump has unpredictably called out individual companies like Boeing, Ford, GM and Apple for practices he dislikes — have spiked interest in these stocks and their peers despite an overall boost to the market fueled by a belief that a Republican president backed by a Republican Congress will loosen regulations on a range of industries, particularly banks and energy companies. While active stock traders may benefit from jumping on Trump’s every tweet, the vast majority of investors are best off stepping back and looking at broader themes. Overall, strategists who pay close attention to markets seem to expect Trump and the Republicans will spur jobs and growth, but that overall, the market may have gotten a little ahead of itself. Meanwhile, for certain sectors, like energy or health care, the future under Trump remains murky. “Now is the time to see what’s going to be transformed from campaign fodder to policy,” says Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott. “We’re taking the view that now is the time to be optimistic, but at the same time somewhat cautious.” And whether Trump keeps on delivering solo messages via tweets is anybody’s guess. “No one expected him to tweet the way he has and to call out specific companies,” says Mike Loewengart, vice president of investment strategy at E-Trade. A recent E-Trade survey found 60% of millennial investors who are active traders and have at least $10,000 in an online brokerage account have traded off a Trump tweet. In most cases, it turns out, the stocks of companies facing Trump’s wrath haven’t dramatically moved from tweet to inauguration day, and in some cases, they’ve even risen slightly. Here’s a look at the “Trump effect” on individual stocks, showing the stock’s price before Trump’s tweet, at the time of the Tweet, and at yesterday’s close.

The committee, which has been asked to submit a report within six months, is tasked to find out the cause behind the incident. "It appears to the central government that it is expedient to investigate and determine the causes and contributory factors leading to the accident and make recommendations to avoid recurrence of such accidents in the future," joint secretary, ministry of civil aviation Satyendra Kumar Mishra, said. The Boeing 737-800 skidded off the Goa airport runway while taking off in the wee hours, but the 161 passengers and crew on board escaped with minor injuries. The aircraft sustained significant damage and remains grounded at Goa International Airport, where a team of Boeing engineers are making an attempt to get the aircraft air-worthy again. The aircraft accident investigation bureau (AAIB) inquiry committee will be headed by deputy director for air safety with the directorate of air safety, R S Passi, who will investigate the incident. The other members of the committee include assistant director, AAIB, Jasbir Singh Largha, and flight operation inspector captain Nitin Anand. The formal inquiry comes after a team of DGCA and AAIB officials waded through the data from the flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder. The crew's statements have also been recorded, sources said. There were 154 passengers and seven crew members on board when the Jet Airways aircraft had reportedly spun 360 degrees before veering off the runway. The incident damaged the landing gear of the aircraft and it came to rest on its nose about 250-300m away from the runway. According to the notification, the committee will also take the assistance of other experts/agencies whenever required. Around 15 passengers suffered "minor" injuries during the evacuation process. The Indian Navy, which controls the airport and operates the air traffic control service, shut down the runway for flight operations for nearly five hours.

In an interview with the Iran daily newspaper, Abedzadeh said there could be no precise timeline for the contract without US Treasury permission. The Islamic republic has ordered about 200 planes from three Western manufacturers since mid-January when economic sanctions were lifted following a deal on Tehran´s nuclear programme. Boeing had confirmed on Wednesday that it was in talks with Iranian airlines interested in buying its passenger planes. “We have been engaged in discussions with Iranian airlines approved by the (US government) about potential purchases of Boeing commercial passenger airplaned and services,” the company said in an email to AFP. Many of Iran´s ageing civil aviation fleet are in desperate need of replacement. In February, the American company was granted approval from the US government to explore resuming sales to Iran after US sanctions were partially lifted in January.—AFP Share this: Print Email Tweet Related SHARE Facebook Twitter tweet Previous articlePakistan, Turkey cooperation growing: Shahbaz Next articleLandslides, floods kill 35 on Indonesia’s Java island Webmaster RELATED ARTICLESMORE FROM AUTHOR Top News SC orders NAB to submit Hudaibiya reference record Top News Parliamentarians agree not to hurl accusations Top News ‘70th anniversary marks new trade links between the UK and Pakistan’ Digital Newspaper Social Diary Signing ceremony of Share Purchase Agreement of PSX with the Consortium of Chinese Exchanges and local financial institutions Management Founder: Zahid Malik Editor-in-Cheif: Faisal Zahid Malik Executive Editor: Gauhar Zahid Malik Editor Social Diary: Sadia Zahid Malik E-Mail : socialdiarymag@gmail.com magazinesocialdiary@hotmail.com Resident Editor Lahore: Khalid Butt E-Mail: obslhr@pakobserver.net Resident Editor Peshawar: Tariq Saeed E-Mail: obspwr@pakobserver.net Group Director : Khurram Jaffrani E-Mail: khurram_jaffrani@hotmail.com Director Marketing : Naveed Ahmad Khan Cell # 0300-5129008 Contact Us Online Edition : Q Malik / Ch Imran Zafar E-Mail: webmaster@pakobserver.net Islamabad: 051-2852027, 051-2852028 E-Mail : observer@pakobserver.net Karachi: 021-35308446-49 E-Mail : obskhi@pakobserver.net Lahore: 042-36306666, 36303333 E-Mail : obslhr@pakobserver.net ABOUT USHead Office Address: Daily Pakistan Observer, Ali AKbar House , Markez G-8, Islamabad Contact us: observer@pakobserver.net FOLLOW US Home Health Voice of People © Copy Rights Reserved .

REUTERS/Alwyn Scott By Alwyn Scott and Ankit Ajmera | SEATTLE SEATTLE The International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers said it planned to petition on Friday for about 2,850 workers at Boeing Co's (BA.N) assembly plant in South Carolina to vote on union representation. The petition with the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), which had been expected, likely would allow workers to hold a secret-ballot election in the next few months. On average, votes take place about three weeks after a petition is filed, IAM spokesman Mike Evans said. The union called off a vote in April 2015 after what it called "political interference" from state lawmakers and "misinformation" spread among workers. The union, in a regulatory filing on Friday, said it sought to address concerns about "subjective raises, inconsistent scheduling policies and a lack of respect on the shop floor." Evans said the union was convinced workers were ready to vote for a union and that an election would be held this year. Boeing said on Friday that a union was not in the "best interest" of its workers in South Carolina. "We believe our teammates deserve to keep their hard-earned money in their pockets while continuing to work with the company to drive meaningful change," Joan Robinson-Berry, Boeing vice president and general manager, South Carolina, said in a statement. South Carolina is a right-to-work state where employees can't be forced to join a union or pay dues even when covered by a union contract. In April 2015, it had the second-lowest union membership in the United States. Boeing's workforce at its main commercial aircraft factories in Washington state is largely unionized. The South Carolina plant, which opened in 2011, makes 787 Dreamliners and is the only Boeing jetliner assembly line outside of Washington state. It is the sole producer of the 787-10, Boeing's largest Dreamliner. The first 787-10 is currently being assembled in South Carolina. It is due for its first flight this year, and the first customer delivery is expected in 2018.

Union officials will say at a news conference on Friday that they plan to file a petition with the National Labor Relations Board to hold an election at the Dreamliner plant and Boeing's other North Charleston production sites. The IAM "will make a major announcement about the ongoing organizing campaign to secure collective bargaining rights for workers at Boeing’s North Charleston operation," according to an announcement for the event, to be held at 7 a.m. at the local International Longshoremen's Association office at 1422 Morrison Drive in Charleston. IAM officials declined to comment in advance of Friday's announcement, but Mike Evans - the union's lead organizer locally - told The Post and Courier in November: "We have the momentum to get to an election." The petition would come at a time when Boeing is making job and other financial cuts to its commercial airplane division in the face of slowing sales and increased competition. The company this month said it will offer voluntary layoffs to hundreds of engineers at the North Charleston facilities and company-wide, and Boeing has said involuntary layoffs might be necessary if further cost reductions are sought. That environment could work in the IAM's favor, according to Hoyt Wheeler, a labor union expert and retired business professor at the University of South Carolina. "When something is being taken away from workers, like job security or wages, that is one of the things that will compel them to join a union," Wheeler said, adding that labor organizers typically wait until they have a vast majority of support from workers - typically between 60 percent and 70 percent - before they risk filing an election petition. Wheeler said the decision to hold an election now also favors the IAM because federal rules changes that have made it easier for unions to win elections under President Barack Obama likely will be rolled back in the months after President-elect Donald Trump takes office and the majority of NLRB directors switches over to Republicans. "They will be a good deal less friendly to unions," he said. Boeing spokeswoman Lori Gunter said the IAM has not officially notified the aerospace company of its intention to file an election petition. "We are not going to speculate on the reason for the IAM reaching out to the media tomorrow, although we have heard the IAM publicly state their intent to file ever since they ran away from their first petition here in 2015," Gunter said Thursday. This will be the second petition the IAM has filed in two years. A previous attempt to organize the Boeing plants was withdrawn in 2015 after union officials said the company had created a "toxic environment" with misinformation and outside political interference. Gov. Nikki Haley and North Charleston Mayor Keith Summey were vocal critics of the IAM the last time it filed for a union election. Joan Robinson-Berry, vice president and general manager of Boeing South, has said she has "no problem" with unions, but: "I think the best thing for our team is to have a direct relationship with us." Gunter said Boeing employees are focused on production of the first 787-10, the largest of the Dreamliner family that will be built exclusively in North Charleston. The first test flight of a 787-10 is expected this spring. "We’ve said consistently over the past several years, and we continue to believe, that a union is not in the best interest of our teammates, our business, our community or our state," she said. "We think it’s important that our teammates, friends, business colleagues and community leaders in South Carolina know that our position has not changed." An IAM spokesman declined to comment on Boeing's statement, saying "it doesn't seem like anything new." It's not clear how many Boeing employees will be eligible to vote this time around. The company's website shows it has 7,609 workers in South Carolina, although many of those would be ineligible because they are management or contractors. The current employment figure is roughly equal to the number of workers Boeing claimed when the last petition was filed in March 2015. At that time, the IAM said 3,175 workers were eligible to vote. Changes in NLRB rules in 2015 have put union elections on a fast track. Prior to the change, it took an average of 5½ weeks between the time a petition was filed and an election held. That time frame was trimmed to just a little more than three weeks by last year. Under the new rules, an election could be held as soon as 13 days after a petition is filed. The streamlined time frame has helped unions win more elections, because employers have less time to present their arguments against union representation. Unions were successful in 68 percent of elections held in 2014, the year before the rules change. Last year, unions won 73 percent of the 1,396 elections that were held. Even so, South Carolina has the nation's lowest percentage of workers represented by organized labor. The federal Bureau of Labor Statistics said South Carolina's union membership rate was 2.1 percent in 2015 - roughly 41,000 union members. Updated figures for 2016 will be released next week. Wheeler said an IAM victory would be "important to the future of unions in South Carolina," while admitting "the climate is tough." A loss, he said, "would represent a lost opportunity" for organized labor but probably wouldn't hurt the state's already-weak standing with unions. A petition filing likely will send Boeing's anti-union efforts "into full panic mode." Wheeler said, with both sides stepping up attempts to get their messages across through radio and television ads and in-house publications at the workplace, such as the lunchroom table-toppers Boeing employed in 2015 comparing the union to rotting fruit. The IAM's previous election effort here was heated, with the union filing an NLRB complaint - later dismissed - claiming two of its organizers visiting workers' homes "were threatened at gunpoint and others reported hostile and near-violent confrontations." In addition to a facility that manufactures and assembles the 787 Dreamliner twin-aisle commercial plane, Boeing's North Charleston facilities include: a plant that builds interior parts, such as overhead bins, for the Dreamliner; a research and technology center that focuses on advanced manufacturing technology; a propulsion center that builds and designs engine parts; and an engineering design center that provides support for the Dreamliner's production. The IAM has nearly 700,000 active and retired members and represents most of Boeing's production workers on the West Coast. Evans, the IAM's lead organizer in North Charleston, and Ken Riley, the longtime president of the local longshoremen's union, are scheduled to speak at Friday's event. "Labor and community groups supporting the efforts by Boeing workers to form a union will also be in attendance," the IAM's announcement states. South Carolina is among 25 states that have right-to-work laws prohibiting mandatory union membership. In South Carolina, for example, collective bargaining agreements apply to all of a company’s eligible workers, not just those who are dues-paying members of a union. Such laws have led to declining union membership, particularly in the South.

By Cox Media Group WASHINGTON, D.C. — When asked what they miss most about the presidency, former presidents often say Air Force One. But CBS News reports that, for Trump, the transition from one wide-body plane to a wider-bodied plane might be considered a downgrade. CBS News compared the history of Air Force One to that of Trump’s plane. Their analysis revealed Trump’s plane once belonged to Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen. Air Force One History: Air Force One isn’t just a plane. It’s a military designation for any Air Force plane the president might be flying. The first plane officially called Air Force One carried President Dwight Eisenhower in 1959, but it was President John F. Kennedy who brought the plane into the jet age. The current fleet is comprised of two specially-modified Boeing 747s, which were first used by President George H. W. Bush in 1990. The two planes have carried every president since, from Bill Clinton to George W. Bush to Barack Obama – at a cost of over $180,000 per hour. Trump’s Plane History: Mr. Trump’s plane has a far different history. Also made by Boeing, the 757 entered service in 1991 with Sterling Airlines, a low-cost Danish airline. It then flew for a Mexican charter company called Taesa, before being sold to Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen who then sold it to Mr. Trump in 2010. That’s when the real refurbishment began. From nose to tail, Mr. Trump’s plane is smaller than Air Force One. It can only fly up to 4,400 miles and carry 43 passengers. Air Force One can fly up to 7,800 miles, with over 70 passengers, CBS News reports. While Air Force One has an onboard hospital, Mr. Trump’s 757 boasts 24-karat gold-plated seat belts and bathroom fittings, plush carpets, cream-colored leather seats and an entertainment center with over 1,000 movie titles branded with Mr. Trump’s name. >> Related: Boeing CEO meets with Trump about Air Force One costs In December, the head of Boeing Co., Dennis Mullenburg, said he promised President-elect Donald Trump that the manufacturer would complete the Air Force One project for less than the $4 billion the president-elect had claimed it would cost. The announcement came after Trump ripped into Boeing over the cost of the program to replace the aging presidential aircraft.  But Muilenburg said that BoeingCo. "would get it done for far less" than the $4 billion that Trump claimed, though he did not suggest what the aircraft manufacturer had estimated for a cost. The president-elect will use the existing jets when he takes office. There are no comments yet. Be the first to post your thoughts.

OLYMPIA — The two largest aerospace worker unions will try again to tie the future of the state’s huge tax break for the Boeing Co. with the number of people the plane-builder employs in Washington. Officials with the Machinist and the engineer unions say a response is needed to the company’s steady shedding of jobs since the Legislature extended those tax incentives to help land the 777X program. They point to the company’s employment data showing there are 11,414 fewer Boeing workers in Washington than when lawmakers approved the extension in a hurried special session in November 2013. Meanwhile, Boeing used those incentives to save nearly $217 million in tax payments in 2014 and $304.8 million in 2015, according to state data. And it could add up to as much as $8.7 billion through 2040, they note. “It is amazing,” said Larry Brown, political director of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers District 751 . Machinists and the Society of Professional Engineering Employees in Aerospace contend the state gave Boeing too good a deal and are drafting a bill to revise the terms. There’s no time frame for when it will be finished and introduced. “We do not have all the particulars settled so far,” Brown said. “We’re going to attempt to provide legislation that hopefully will protect jobs for Washington state so that Boeing will not be permitted to move jobs out of state without that affecting their tax break.” The two unions also might need someone to find a sponsor for the bill. Rep. June Robinson, D-Everett, championed the cause the past two years. But she’s not yet committed to do so again because of other legislative initiatives. “There’s conversation. There’s interest,” Robinson said in a recent interview. “The Legislature continues to watch this. A lot of folks are dismayed at the continuous job losses.” Bills carried by Robinson in 2015 and 2016 sought to require Boeing sustain a minimum number of jobs in Washington in order to reap the full benefits of the incentives. Under those bills, the company faced the loss of its tax break if its total workforce dipped below a certain threshold. This year’s version will likely focus on the shipping of jobs to other states and not contain any threshold, Brown said. And it will not “punish” Boeing for job-related moves caused by a downturn in the aerospace industry, he said. Even with a retooled approach, the union will face long odds at getting anything passed. Robinson’s bills lapsed in the House Finance Committee the past two years and there are no signs the panel would act differently in 2017. No tax break bill has been heard in the Republican-controlled Senate the past two sessions. It’s also unclear what degree of support they can count on from Democratic Gov. Jay Inslee. A year ago, in a speech to executives of Boeing and other aerospace firms, Inslee warned that accountability measures might be needed if the outflow of jobs could not be stemmed. Since getting re-elected, he’s continued to express disappointment in the loss of jobs and a willingness to listen to proposals. At the same time, he’s focused on passing a plan to fully fund public schools. “There have been decisions by management that have been disappointing that are not necessitated by lack of orders, that are not necessitated by recession, are not necessitated by any WTO (World Trade Organization) decision, but simply an effort to move some jobs out of state. That’s not acceptable to us,” he said in a recent interview in Everett. “I’m open to ideas,” he said. “I’ve got a principal obligation right now to finance schools. But I’m happy to consider ideas that will improve employment because we know people are concerned about this.” Union leaders said that’s the message they heard when they met with the governor in November. “We’re hopeful. He seems to be more open to look at it. Certainly the discussions in Olympia have changed,” said SPEEA spokesman Bill Dugovich, a reference on the Legislature’s focus on school funding this session. “We certainly realize that bringing up the jobs issue is important.” Meanwhile, Boeing and Aerospace Works for Washington, a newly formed alliance of businesses and government leaders, is primed to oppose any clawback bill. Snohomish County Executive Dave Somers and Everett Mayor Ray Stephanson are members of the new coalition, as is Boeing. In a statement, a Boeing spokesman noted that the company has lived up to its commitments and already has invested more than $1 billion in the 777X Composite Wing Center in Everett. “Changing the parameters of the incentives now would simply increase the cost of building airplanes in this state, and unnecessarily put excellent, family-wage jobs in Washington at risk,” said Paul Bergman, who handles communications and media relations for Boeing Commercial Airplanes division. Hundreds of companies use the tax incentives and aerospace jobs are up overall in the state since the Legislature acted in 2013, he said. “It’s clear the incentives are working as intended to keep the industry an economic driver for the state,” he said. The 2017 legislative session is scheduled to run through April 23. Jerry Cornfield: 360-352-8623; jcornfield@heraldnet.com. Twitter: @dospueblos.

Restaurants Home Nation / World Perspectives as the search for the missing jet ends print Share | e-mail Facebook Tweet StumbleUpon Google Perspectives as the search for the missing jet ends By Russell Goldman and Michelle Innis / New York Times News Service Published Jan 20, 2017 at 12:02AM The search for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 is over, assigned, for now, to the same corner of history as the hunt for Amelia Earhart: a cold case. An unsolved mystery. The nearly 3-year-long effort to find the missing jet cost $160 million, the largest and most expensive search in aviation history. For the investigators who scoured 46,000 square miles of the Indian Ocean seabed, there will be no answers. For the families of the 239 victims, there will be no closure. For all the technical questions asked during the search — Why did the plane go down? And where? — ending it raises a host of ethical questions: Do countries have an obligation to keep looking? How much should they spend? Is the search for a missing plane any different from the search for missing individuals? Flight 370 disappeared on the way from Kuala Lumpur, the Malaysian capital, to Beijing on March 8, 2014. Investigators determined that the plane had veered off course and flown south for several hours, for reasons unknown. On Tuesday, the governments of China, Malaysia and Australia, which together have conducted the search for the missing plane, said experts last year concluded that the plane had crashed within a vast area of the Indian Ocean north of the search zone but that further efforts to find it would be prohibitively expensive. The governments said they would reopen the investigation only if credible evidence came to light of the location of the plane, a Boeing 777. “The underwater search for MH370 has been suspended. The decision to suspend the underwater search has not been taken lightly nor without sadness,” the countries said in a joint statement released Tuesday. Investigators are obligated to continue the search, family members said, to bring emotional closure, to provide the only concrete evidence to explain what felled the plane and to prevent similar accidents. • A passenger’s daughter: Quitting makes no sense “It is incomprehensible that they would give up right now,” said Grace Nathan, 28, whose mother, Anne Daisy, was on the flight. “I can’t imagine living the rest of my life accepting that people just disappeared into thin air,” Nathan said after learning that the search had been stopped. “It extends beyond me and my family,” said Nathan, a member of Voice370, a group that represents relatives and friends of those aboard. “Of course we would like to know what happened. But millions of people fly every day on Boeing aircraft, and the flying public has the right to know what happened,” she said. • A former pilot: Search does nothing for safety Experts said little new information would be learned even if the plane were discovered, although the mystery still vexes them. The Boeing 777 “enjoys a phenomenal safety record,” said Capt. John Cox, a former airline pilot and the chief executive of Safety Operating Systems, an aviation consultancy based in Washington. “We now have an open question about the safety of one airplane. That is a major issue and one that will remain open, and no one wants that.” Cox said that investigators should have completed the search of an additional 10,000-square-mile area that experts identified in December as the possible crash zone, but that ultimately they would have to conclude the search at some point, however disappointing. “We’re not enhancing safety, just by searching,” he said. • An MIT professor: Cockpit recorder is no longer useful Professor R. John Hansman, director of the International Center for Air Transportation at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said the existing evidence suggested that mechanical failure did not lead to the crash but that the pilot was most likely responsible. Even if investigators were to find the wreckage and recover the cockpit voice recorder, it would prove useless, he said. The plane, he said, remained aloft for five hours on a consistent trajectory until its fuel was exhausted. But the recorder includes only five hours of tape, and “what we would have gotten is five hours of silence.” The data recorder, he said, would also be useless because “the plane flew for hours without a systemic problem.” • An ethicist: Money could have saved 50,000 from malaria “One hundred and fifty million dollars was already far too much to spend on the search for the missing plane, so calling off the search now is the right decision,” Peter Singer, an ethics professor at Princeton University, said. “It is estimated that by donating to the Against Malaria Foundation so that it can distribute more bed nets, it is possible to save a life for approximately $3,000,” he said. “If that is accurate, then the money spent on the search could have saved 50,000 lives. Would anyone think that finding the plane is more important than that?” 16225534 View next article in Nation & World     Get Central Oregon's top headlines delivered to your inbox every morning GO print version Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus This image is copyrighted.

The Wichita, Kansas-based maker of aerospace components notified workers in December that the supply chain work "could possibly be sub-contracted in the near future," according to a letter seen by Reuters. One source said Spirit was considering outsourcing the jobs to a company in India. Donald Trump, who will be sworn in as U.S. president on Friday, has repeatedly criticized U.S. companies for not doing more to keep manufacturing jobs in the United States and has threatened "retribution or consequences" for companies that move operations out of the country. The jobs Spirit is considering moving are not manufacturing positions. Spirit confirmed that it had asked outside vendors about their capabilities and interest in bidding to handle purchase-order administration. It also has asked the union representing the potentially affected workers for a plan to keep the jobs where they are while saving up to $7 million a year. Spirit said no decision has been made to move forward with the plan. As a major supplier, Spirit builds 42 fuselages a month for Boeing 737 planes, and makes parts for other Boeing and Airbus jetliners. Spirit also supplies parts to major defense contractors such as Boeing, Northrop Grumman Corp and Lockheed Martin Corp's Sikorsky unit. Spirit's shares closed up 1 percent at $57.25. Spirit spokesman Jarrod Bartlett said it was the first time the company, which was spun off from Boeing in 2005, had considering moving supply chain jobs. "It's too soon to speculate" on potential supply chain risks from the move or the future location of the work, he added. The jobs involved "executing back-end work on supply agreements" on all company purchases, he said, including raw materials such as aluminum and titanium, parts and components and office supplies. The work of negotiating supplier agreements, managing supplier performance and choosing suppliers is not part of its study of moving purchase-order work, he said. Outsourcing to a foreign company could complicate Spirit's defense work, and runs counter to the trend at some defense firms, said Franklin Turner, a Washington, D.C.-based lawyer at McCarter & English who represents prime contractors and sub-contractors in the supply chain. "It's a reality of globalization that companies are trying to find the cheapest rates to get work done," he said. But "companies I deal with are shying away from that practice. Anytime something like that is performed outside the United States, there's an increased risk to the integrity of the operation." Aerospace companies and other manufacturers carefully manage their supply chains to keep assembly lines running. Any hiccup in the millions of pieces Spirit handles potentially threatens production of finished Boeing and Airbus aircraft. Spirit has a history of on-time delivery, but other suppliers have caused costly factory delays at Boeing and Airbus in recent years. "Spirit is operating in an extremely competitive global marketplace, and we are always looking for ways to improve efficiencies and provide value to our customers," Spirit said in its statement. In the letter, Spirit said workers had 60 days to offer an alternative plan that could save $5 million to $7 million per year. The union representing the workers, the Society of Professional Engineering Employees in Aerospace, declined to comment.

REUTERS/Saul Loeb/PoolMore By Alwyn Scott SEATTLE (Reuters) - Spirit AeroSystems Holdings Inc <SPR.N>, a major supplier to aircraft maker Boeing Co <BA.N>, is considering outsourcing up to 85 U.S. supply chain jobs, possibly to a company overseas, according to three people familiar with the plan. The Wichita, Kansas-based maker of aerospace components notified workers in December that the supply chain work "could possibly be sub-contracted in the near future," according to a letter seen by Reuters. One source said Spirit was considering outsourcing the jobs to a company in India. Donald Trump, who will be sworn in as U.S. president on Friday, has repeatedly criticized U.S. companies for not doing more to keep manufacturing jobs in the United States and has threatened "retribution or consequences" for companies that move operations out of the country. The jobs Spirit is considering moving are not manufacturing positions. Spirit confirmed that it had asked outside vendors about their capabilities and interest in bidding to handle purchase-order administration. It also has asked the union representing the potentially affected workers for a plan to keep the jobs where they are while saving up to $7 million a year. Spirit said no decision has been made to move forward with the plan. As a major supplier, Spirit builds 42 fuselages a month for Boeing 737 planes, and makes parts for other Boeing and Airbus <AIR.PA> jetliners. Spirit also supplies parts to major defense contractors such as Boeing, Northrop Grumman Corp <NOC.N> and Lockheed Martin Corp's <LMT.N> Sikorsky unit. Spirit's shares closed up 1 percent at $57.25. Spirit spokesman Jarrod Bartlett said it was the first time the company, which was spun off from Boeing in 2005, had considering moving supply chain jobs. "It's too soon to speculate" on potential supply chain risks from the move or the future location of the work, he added. The jobs involved "executing back-end work on supply agreements" on all company purchases, he said, including raw materials such as aluminum and titanium, parts and components and office supplies. The work of negotiating supplier agreements, managing supplier performance and choosing suppliers is not part of its study of moving purchase-order work, he said. Outsourcing to a foreign company could complicate Spirit's defense work, and runs counter to the trend at some defense firms, said Franklin Turner, a Washington, D.C.-based lawyer at McCarter & English who represents prime contractors and sub-contractors in the supply chain. "It's a reality of globalization that companies are trying to find the cheapest rates to get work done," he said. But "companies I deal with are shying away from that practice. Anytime something like that is performed outside the United States, there's an increased risk to the integrity of the operation." Aerospace companies and other manufacturers carefully manage their supply chains to keep assembly lines running. Any hiccup in the millions of pieces Spirit handles potentially threatens production of finished Boeing and Airbus <AIR.PA> aircraft. Spirit has a history of on-time delivery, but other suppliers have caused costly factory delays at Boeing and Airbus in recent years. "Spirit is operating in an extremely competitive global marketplace, and we are always looking for ways to improve efficiencies and provide value to our customers," Spirit said in its statement. In the letter, Spirit said workers had 60 days to offer an alternative plan that could save $5 million to $7 million per year. The union representing the workers, the Society of Professional Engineering Employees in Aerospace, declined to comment.

TRANSCRIPT This is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form. AMY GOODMAN: This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org. It’s "War, Peace and the Presidency." We’re broadcasting on this Inauguration Day special live from WHUT on the campus of Howard University here in the nation’s capital. I’m Amy Goodman, with Nermeen Shaikh. NERMEEN SHAIKH: We’re less than four hours away from the inauguration of Donald Trump. Protests have already begun here in the streets of Washington. To talk more about the inauguration of Trump, we’re joined now by two guests. AMY GOODMAN: Naomi Klein is the author of This Changes Everything: Capitalism vs. the Climate. And Lee Fang is with us, the investigative journalist at The Intercept covering the intersection of money and politics. His latest piece, "Who’s Paying for Inauguration Parties? Companies and Lobbyists with a Lot at Stake." Naomi, let’s start with you. You’ve come here to Washington, D.C. You’ve been following the election and what’s taken place. Your thoughts? NAOMI KLEIN: Well, it’s—I mean, I think there’s a few things we need to remember this morning, which is certainly a destabilizing day for a lot of your viewers and listeners and for all of us, really. You know, as we’ve already heard—right?—he did not win the popular vote. And I think, in addition to that, and I know this is maybe not the most popular thing to say when everyone is calling for unity among progressives, you know, I think even within this rigged system that suppresses so many votes, he didn’t win it. Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party establishment lost it. It was low enthusiasm, low voter turnout on their side that gave the election to Trump. And I think that’s important to understand even amidst these calls for unity, because if that truth gets buried, then the mistakes will be repeated. The other thing that I think is really important, and it’s—I think it’s fantastic that people are on the streets last night, today all day—it is so important to push back in these early days, when they’re going to be throwing a whole lot at us. We’re seeing talk of a shock-and-awe budget. By the way, let’s not call it a "skinny budget." This is another rebranding campaign, like "alt-right." This is a savage budget that would cut $10 trillion, they’re talking about, that would attack programs targeted towards violence against women, renewable energy, environmental justice. I mean, they’re going after everything. But the point is, is that Trump—I mean, we know the transition is in disarray. And it seems as if they’re outsourcing the whole thing to the Heritage Foundation, which is what they’re there for, right? They have this infrastructure. They’ve got all of these policies and budgets ready to go. But this is going to be incredibly unpopular. And so, if people push back really hard, and it sees Trump’s approval rating drop even more—one thing we know about Donald Trump: He likes firing people. This we know. And I think that the people who he has outsourced to right now could get blamed very early on and pushed out, and I think that would be very important, because I think when it comes to economics, there’s a fair amount of evidence that he’s not an ideologue. But this is—but I think we’re headed for a very, very ideological push. AMY GOODMAN: Last night at the Peace Ball, you called this a corporate coup d’état. What do you mean? NAOMI KLEIN: Well, I think one of the things that’s remarkable about his appointees is just how many—you know, how many CEOs are going into these positions, and just this process of kind of cutting out the middleman, right? Exxon running the State Department. AMY GOODMAN: I want to ask: Where were you when you heard that Rex Tillerson, at the time the current CEO of ExxonMobil— NAOMI KLEIN: Yeah. AMY GOODMAN: —the largest private oil company in the world, was nominated? NAOMI KLEIN: And not just any oil company. You know, this is a company that is the main target of the climate movement, that is under investigation by multiple states’ attorneys general and the SEC for its various deceptions, financial and climate deceptions, the target of a huge campaign, because this is a company that was doing really some of the most important research into the reality of climate change back in the 1970s and then bankrolled the deceptions that lost us decades of climate action in the 1990s, and really up into the present day. So, I don’t know—I don’t remember exactly where I was. But in some ways, you know, to echo something Bill McKibben has said, my colleague at 350, you know, it takes the mask off, right? Because these companies, as Lee well knows, I mean, they already had a huge amount of influence, but now it’s almost like they’re tired of playing the game, they’re tired of the cajoling and the bankrolling and the legalized bribery, and they’re just going to do the job themselves—you know, cut out the middleman. And so we see that with Tillerson. We see that with labor, as well. AMY GOODMAN: Whether Puzder makes his way to actually being labor secretary is very interesting. NAOMI KLEIN: Yeah, yeah. But, I mean, one thing I would say about both these cases is—and I think this is, once again, important to remember on a day like today, when a lot of people feel so demoralized—these guys are panicked because of the power of rising social movements. Right? I mean, why is Puzder so panicked? Because of the Fight for 15. Because of the wave of victories for a living wage. Because of the—because of the very real possibility that Bernie Sanders could have won, and he would have taken that movement demand and brought it to the federal level, to federal policy. That was his campaign promise. And Tillerson, I mean, the biggest threat he faces is the goals that are enshrined in the Paris Accord, these hard-won goals to keep temperatures below 1.5 to 2 degrees. That would be the end of his business model, right? So this, you know, what I called a corporate coup, is really—it’s really about panic as much as anything else, and holding back these tides of progress on multiple fronts. You know, Steve Mnuchin and his friends are also worried about their business model and about the—about Occupy, about the Sanders campaign, about the regulation that they would face. So, you know, I think we should see this in some ways as sort of a panicked last gasp. But that doesn’t mean we don’t need to confront it with everything we have. NERMEEN SHAIKH: Well, let’s go to what’s going on today in Washington, D.C., the inauguration. Lee, your piece, most recent piece, out yesterday, is called "Who’s Paying for Inauguration Parties? Companies and Lobbyists with a Lot at Stake." So tell us: Who is paying? LEE FANG: Well, we don’t know the full list of sponsors of the different inauguration festivities, but there are private events and, of course, the official inauguration events associated with the Trump transition. And these are all festivities that are privately financed. And according to some reports, we know that the official Trump inauguration events are sponsored by companies like AT&T, Boeing. And they’re offered these special packages where if they provide a certain amount to finance these parties that are going on all over Washington, they get private meet and greets with the incoming a administration and the nominees for Cabinet. They get to party with the leadership of the congressional GOP. And, you know, these companies have tens of billions of dollars, if not more, at stake over the next four years. Boeing, for example, has lots of military contracts. They rely on government subsidies through the Export-Import Bank. AT&T would like a repeal of net neutrality, the rules won by the Obama administration over the last four years. And, of course, we might see another era of mergers and acquisitions, which, of course, need regulatory approval. So, the swamp, as it were, is welcoming the Trump administration, and they’re hoping to get in early to win access. NERMEEN SHAIKH: Well, is it unusual, though? Who typically pays for inauguration parties? Like, what happened in previous elections? LEE FANG: No, and I think that’s an important point to make. From, you know, Bill Clinton to Reagan to Obama, a lot of candidates campaigned to throw the bums out and challenge the establishment. But too often, you know, this city, Washington, D.C., is run by lobbyists. They control the most powerful institutions. They set the parameters of the debate. And when candidates, like Donald Trump, who promised to take on the establishment, to challenge these elites, as he’s getting to Washington, he’s being quickly coopted. NERMEEN SHAIKH: Well, I mean, that’s one of the striking things about his appointments, the fact that there’s so many people from Goldman Sachs, when he spent so much of his time campaigning criticizing Clinton for her ties to Goldman Sachs. LEE FANG: Yeah, no, and I think that’s important to realize. You know, if you look at this Cabinet, it’s filled with CEOs and other elites. And I think in the next hundred days, we will actually see a kind of a class war. Trump promised to take on these globalists, these— NAOMI KLEIN: Yeah. LEE FANG: —economic elites. But we will see, the next hundred days, a ruthless agenda on behalf of these same elites against worker protections, climate regulations. It’s very likely that some of the very first executive orders that come out of the Trump administration are attempts to repeal much of the Obama legacy. You know, Obama only had control or a friendly Congress for two years of his administration. Most of his legacy were administrative rules, agency action. And those reforms are very fragile. It’s very easy to repeal those type of rule makings. So we’ll see an attempt to chip away at everything, from the Clean Power Plan to protections for retirement security, protections for workers trying to organize at fast-food restaurants—there’s a recent joint employer rule from the Labor Department—everything from those rules to more obscure rules that govern food safety. AMY GOODMAN: I was watching Fox News yesterday, and one of the hosts said that Donald Trump has three balls, and Obama had many more balls, which was a very interesting comment he made. But he actually was talking about these events that are taking place. The number of people who’ve come out, far, far fewer, to say the least. I think at the big concert last night, there were something like 10,000 people, compared to 400,000 people for Obama. But, Lee, you write about the Black Tie & Boots Inaugural Ball, a party by—for Texas lawmakers. Explain who is funding it. LEE FANG: Yeah, I mean, this is an event—you know, many of these parties that go on outside the kind of official inauguration ball schedule—I mean, there are parties all over Washington. They’re attempting to influence the lower-level administrative staffers, to get congressional members kind of on board with the corporate agenda. And so, you know, the Texas delegation, that’s the Black Tie & Boots Ball, they’re throwing a big party in Prince George’s County near Washington, D.C., and it’s sponsored by a number of corporate interests that are going to be pushing very hard on the issues we just mentioned, many different oil companies, firms like ExxonMobil and Koch Industries, that would like to see more fracking on federal lands, a repeal of many of the different EPA rules and the methane rule that came out very recently from the Obama administration. They’ve got very clear motives here. But for the time being, they’re going to be paying for the hors d’oeuvres and the festivities all weekend. NERMEEN SHAIKH: And, Lee Fang, can you tell us a little bit—you talked about what Trump might do in his first hundred days. There are limits on certain things he can do, because he requires congressional approval. But some of the things you mentioned, he doesn’t require congressional approval for at all, so he may well succeed in doing that in the next just slightly over three months— LEE FANG: Right. NERMEEN SHAIKH: —including cuts on, you know, climate payments and the federal regulations you spoke of. LEE FANG: Yeah, I mean, he’s going to go after these rules in a number of ways. One way is through a fairly obscure law called the Congressional Review Act. That’s a special law that allows a resolution of disapproval, and that can affect regulations passed over just the last few months, not the last few—last six years. Still, many of those rules came out late in the Obama administration. And Democrats cannot filibuster a Congressional Review Act resolution. So, with Republican majorities in Congress, there’s nothing stopping them from passing a CRA resolution of disapproval to roll back many of those rules, potentially hundreds. And, of course, there are executive orders that he can take to revoke Obama’s executive orders. And once he fills these agencies with his staff, they can carve out exceptions to the rules and make them, even if not officially repealed, effectively useless. AMY GOODMAN: Before we wrap up this hour—we’re actually broadcasting for seven hours through the inauguration, bringing it to people live, as well as going to the streets with our reporters on the scene where protests are happening. Thousands of activists are already out this morning. Naomi Klein, tomorrow, a massive march is planned right here in Washington, D.C., Women March on Washington, D.C. Hundreds of thousands are expected, if not more. NAOMI KLEIN: Mm-hmm, yeah. And I think, once again, these—you know, we know he understands numbers, and, as we heard from Michael Moore, we know he’s very thin-skinned and is thrown by a few hundred. So, you know, close to a million people or however many people are on the streets tomorrow, I think it’s going to be destabilizing. And this sort of show of force is tremendously important. It is significant that it seems that he’s going after programs for violence against women, as perhaps one of his first acts. And frankly, you know, misogyny is a thread that connects so many of his appointments, this drive to denigrate women. And I think just showing that we’re not afraid is going to be incredibly important. And I think it’s also important that the march is as diverse as it is, that it is going to be led in many ways by women of color, and I think that this is part of not repeating the mistakes of the campaign. AMY GOODMAN: And your thoughts on the number of congressmembers who are boycotting the inauguration? NAOMI KLEIN: You know, I think it’s all good. I mean, all these acts of courage in standing up to a bully is incredibly important. But, you know, I think there’s every reason to believe that he’s going to employ a strategy of trying to overwhelm people. This has been a strategy just in terms of confusion and distraction, this sort of shock-and-awe approach. And so, staying unified, staying focused, having each other’s backs, this is all going to be tremendously important in the weeks to come, because, you know, I think that if we win a few key victories in the early days, it’s going to be very destabilizing, and it may lead to a reassessment because of the chaos in there. But if we lose those, you know, they’ll taste blood. AMY GOODMAN: Well, Naomi Klein, we hope you will stay with us. We’re broadcasting throughout the day today. For those who are leaving us now, if your station is leaving us, you can go to democracynow.org. Lee Fang, thanks so much for being with us. LEE FANG: Thank you for having me. AMY GOODMAN: You’re going out in the streets—of The Intercept. We’ll link to your piece. And we will be broadcasting for seven hours on this Inauguration Day. Saturday from 10:00 Eastern Standard Time in the morning to 3:00, we’ll be broadcasting from the main stage at the Women’s March on Washington. I’m Amy Goodman, with Nermeen Shaikh.

Expectations are high for a flurry of excitement and activity from Washington in the week ahead as President Trump gets to work. But markets probably will not yet get much in the way of clues on how quickly the new administration will push the tax and growth policies that have driven both stocks and interest rates higher. Trump is expected to make the repeal of Obamacare a priority. He is also seen moving quickly on the topics of trade with Mexico, immigration and regulations in areas like energy. However, it's less likely that there will be much new on the programs markets care about most since they also must wind through Congress. As traders fixate on Washington, there are also about 20 percent of the S&P 500 companies reporting in the coming week, including Alphabet, Boeing, Caterpillar, Microsoft and McDonald's. Of the S&P companies already reporting, 65 percent have beaten earnings estimates, and earnings growth based on the reports and estimates looks to be 6.5 percent for the fourth quarter, according to Thomson Reuters. Traders had hoped Trump would play up the pro-growth agenda during his inaugural address Friday. Instead, he focused on the theme of putting America first in a speech that had a strong protectionist ring. "I expect volatility to be a little bit higher in the first 100 days than it was in the last part of 2016, when there was a sigh of relief and focus was more on the macro and the hopes for the macro," said Kate Moore, BlackRock chief equity strategist. "We're going to have a lot more volatility, as some of this policy gets ironed out and we get more clarity." She said it could take a while to see what tax reform will look like. "I think we will get a little more clarity and then it's very likely we will have a slightly better road map when it comes to taxes over the next two months. I think that's going to be hugely important. We will have more comments and certainly more sense of the road map when it comes to trade," she said. Moore said one of Trump's most important comments in the past week was that the dollar is too strong. A strong dollar hurts corporate profits and hurts emerging markets. "The main takeaway I had from Trump and his comments on the dollar … was an acknowledgment that we don't want the dollar to be too strong, going into trade negotiations," said Moore. She said long dollar is a very crowded trade and she does not believe it will appreciate as much as many expect. That's simply because the global is improving and differences in monetary policy and growth between the U.S. and other regions won't be as great. Moore said she's neutral on U.S. stocks and would become more bullish if earnings continue to improve and there's more clarity around policy from Washington. She said there is a lot of reason for more dispersion on stock performance. "It's going to be from growth, inflation, policy and [Trump's] tweets and very likely how effective companies have been in containing their costs and managing to maintain their margins at this point," she said. "It seems to me there are a lot of reasons for differentiation at this point." Stocks in the past week were flattish, with the S&P 500 down 0.2 percent at 2,271, and the Dow was about 0.3 percent lower at 19,827. Treasury yields had a big move in the past week, with the 10-year nearly touching 2.30 percent and rising to 2.50 percent by Friday. Moore likes small caps and also emerging markets. "I think the fears of a trade war are overblown. It's one of the reasons we continued to be maintaining a constructive outlook for emerging markets," she said. She said Trump's inaugural comments Friday were "downbeat" and it was disappointing that he pointed to problems in the economy when there is near full employment and earnings growth is picking up. The fact Trump's comments sounded protectionist unsettled some in the markets who were hoping he would sound more traditional and not as if he could start a trade war. Economists put trade concerns at the top of the list of what could change the growth outlook. "By far the number one issue on the global economy in the next year is how far down the path of trade tensions do we go here, and mixed into those is also geopolitical tensions as well. So do we have a gradual process, where there's some concession on all sides and things will move smoothly, or do things get very heated and people start to worry about serious back-and-forth tariffs?" said Ethan Harris, head of global economics at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Trump is expected to open talks with Mexico and Canada on the North American Free Trade Agreement, which has been in place since the 1990s. He has called for tariffs on Mexican produced goods though he is not expected to take any action yet. Mexico's president called a press conference on Monday at which he is expected to discuss trade with the U.S. Harris said it will be important to see how Trump deals with China. Trump in the past week said he would not label the country a currency manipulator right away, as he threatened, and that he would speak to Chinese officials first. Harris said China has been trying to prevent its currency from falling, not pushing it lower. "Certainly Trump is going to want to do something that gets China's attention … something that kind of jolts the negotiating process," he said. "I don't know whether that will be what he does out of the gate. It could be after he waits for some of the other stuff like the Affordable Care Act to go through. I think it's a first 100 days story." For the U.S. markets next week, Harris said fourth-quarter GDP released on Friday will be important. He expects growth of 2.4 percent, a bit higher than consensus. "Basically if you look at the broad data story right now, the economy is showing a little sign of picking up. Confidence is picking up. Some of this is optimism is about fiscal policy and deregulation, and some of this was already happening in the data before the election," said Harris. He said Trump has so far been a positive for the economy and now risks being negative if he is too aggressive on trade. "He's taking over at a pretty good time. The economy is at full employment, wages are beginning to accelerate. You're not in a world where the Fed has to tighten too quickly. It is a positive way to start," Harris said. "Right or wrong, a president gets credit for the economy. He is inheriting a good economy. Obama inherited a disaster." Moore also said the economy was already kicking in to a better gear before the election. "We actually think growth and reflation and momentum started before the U.S. election. The market acknowledged the momentum, and that turning point was super charged by the U.S. election," she said. She's looking to hear more from Trump on his plans. "It was not perhaps the most optimistic presidential speech I've heard. I think the real key is how Trump and his cabinet pivot to be truly looking forward instead of just criticizing what has and hasn't' happened and perceived weakness in the U.S. economy," she said.

Opinion Invest in schools and give every child a chance to succeed Originally published January 20, 2017 at 1:54 pm Updated January 20, 2017 at 3:04 pm Gabriel Campanario / The Seattle Times No school district in Washington is getting the funding it needs from Olympia, but wealthier communities have recourse through local levy funding. Share story By Nathan Gibbs-Bowling Special to The Times BUDGETS are moral documents that send messages about what we value. Right now the collective message we’re sending as a state is that we don’t value our students in low-income urban and rural communities. While much of Washington state, especially along the Interstate 5 and 405 corridors, is thriving, there are concerning problems bubbling below the surface for hundreds of our state’s schools. On one hand, Washington enjoys one of the most dynamic economies in the nation. We are the birthplace of Boeing and UPS. We are the home of Microsoft, Starbucks, Costco, Nordstrom and Amazon. We are a prosperous state, with rising real estate values and a growing job market. That is our current reality, but we’re not guaranteed this same future. Nathan Gibbs-Bowling is the 2016 Washington State Teacher of the Year, a National Teacher of the Year Finalist, a 2014 recipient of the Milken National Educator Award, and a Co-Founder of Teachers United and the Washington State teacher Advisory Council (WATAC). He teaches AP government & politics and AP geography at Lincoln High in Tacoma. On the other hand, we have an ongoing, near decadelong fight over adequate school funding. From my travels and conversations around the state as 2016 Teacher of the Year, I know that morale in the teaching profession is low, particularly in our highest-need schools. We have a teacher shortage in STEM (Science Technology Engineering Math) positions and for nearly all classes in rural communities across the state. We aren’t producing enough college graduates: Washington state ranks second in the nation in the net number of trained workers with a bachelor’s degree or higher who arrive from out-of-state. When it comes to student achievement, we’re in the middle of the pack nationally, between Nebraska and Kansas, as measured by the National Assessment of Educational Progress. Rather than blaming teachers for the state of affairs, as many are wont to do, I believe there are budgetary and resource causes for much of this. Our highest-need schools lack necessary resources to do the job they’re asked of. Consider that many schools have higher numbers of special-education students, higher numbers of English Language Learners, more students experiencing housing instability, more students experiencing food insecurity, more students with chronic health issues, and more students who’ve experienced early-life trauma, more low-income students requiring more services — these schools all require more resources. But the current state-funding system delivers the opposite. No school district in Washington is getting the funding it needs from Olympia, but wealthier communities have recourse through local levy funding. Families in more affluent communities raise local revenue by taxing themselves, which lower-income communities simply can’t afford to. This is not theoretical. This calculus is very personal to me and the work we have done over the last decade at Lincoln High in Tacoma. We have an extended school day where students get additional academic support, along with college, life and career advising. We have a dedicated staff member working to connect students whose lives are in flux to services and housing. Six times a year, we have Scholar Saturdays where hundreds of students come to school to get caught up, receive extra help and work to raise their grades.

As a result, over the last decade our graduation rate has soared above 80 percent and we have created a strong postsecondary culture. Going to college or vocational school has become the expectation in what was for most of my life the city’s lowest-performing high school. But all of this took money — money that hundreds of schools and districts lack and money the state is constitutionally obligated to provide but does not. If my high school, surrounded by low-income households, was part of a low-income, single high school district, as is the case in Tukwila and many rural parts of the state, local property taxes would need to be raised to untenable levels to provide for the programmatic needs of my students. We simply could not afford to do what we do and my entire community would be worse off. If we are to maintain our current prosperity as a state, we must make investments in our shared future. Gov. Jay Inslee’s 2017-2019 budget asks persons and businesses that have benefitted from our economy to help out, including an increase of the business-and-occupation tax on services provided by accountants, attorneys, real estate agents and others, and a tax on capital-gains earnings above $25,000 for individuals. His proposal provides a property-tax cut for the vast majority of Washington homeowners. This would give school districts around the state the funds needed to replicate the successes and interventions we’ve had done at Lincoln High. After 10 years of the McCleary lawsuit, the stakes for our state, our schools and our most vulnerable students are too high. Members of the Legislature don’t have to love the governor’s budget — I myself have been critical of him in the past — but people who disagree with his budget must offer meaningful alternatives and not just say “no.” We need for them to offer something besides partisan opposition and budget gimmickry.

By Graham Lanktree January 20, 2017 19:12 GMT Workers install the presidential seal at the site of the Commander in Chief inaugural ball for President-elect Donald Trump in Washington DC 19 January 2016Reuters/Rick Wilking An ethics group that lobbies against money in politics is questioning why the cost of Donald Trump's $100m inauguration is double the amount spent by past presidents. "Trump's inauguration will be a record-breaking spectacle. He is planning on spending $100m for his party to enter the White House," said Craig Holman, a lobbying and ethics expert at the watchdog group Public Citizen, adding it's "almost double the previous record set by Obama in 2009". Trump, however, has fewer events and a shorter parade than than past presidents. Donations have reportedly included $500,000 from oil corporation Chevron, $1m from Boeing, and cash and in-kind donations from AT&T — with the telecoms company said to be "quintupling" phone coverage on the National Mall. In order to reach such a high fund-raising goal, "Trump is imposing very few restrictions on the sources and amounts of donations", said Holman. "His inaugural committee is offering packages to entice large donors; the more one gives, the better access to Trump and congressional leaders." A brochure of inaugural events obtained by the Center for Public Integrity in November 2016 showed that anyone donating $1m or more to the inauguration will get a candlelight dinner and access to the President and other events that feature exclusive access to "select Cabinet appointees and House and Senate leadership". During his first inauguration President Barack Obama limited donations to $50,000. In 2001 George W Bush capped his donations at $100,000 and at $250,000 in 2005, according to figures compiled by Public Citizen. The non-profit pushes for limits to money in politics in Washington. In 2009 Obama collected a total of $35.3m – 80% of which came from just 211 people, including many Wall Street figures such as a senior executive at Lehman Brothers, the CEO of UBS Americas, and the vice chairman of investment banking at Citigroup. In 2013 he raised $43.8m and allowed corporations to donate $1m . Compare all this to 1997 when President Bill Clinton capped contributions at $100 and the committee raised a total of $23.7m. "I can't imagine how they are going to spend that amount of money — and why they would even keep raising money," said Steve Kerrigan, CEO for Obama's inaugural committee in 2013, in an interview with Fox News. "We planned the two largest inaugurations in the history of our country and we never spent anywhere near that." Traditionally any excess money from inaugurations is donated to charity. The Presidential Inaugural Committee and President Trump's transition team did not respond for requests for comment from IBTimes UK about what the inauguration funds were going to or whether they would be donated to charity. Despite its impressive cost, unlike past inaugurations Trump's will be more subdued with only three "low-key" gala balls, according to Reuters, as opposed to the 10 held for Obama's first inauguration. There will be fewer stars and fewer people attending than the 1.8 million people that turned out for the historic election of President Barack Obama. Some 900,000 are expected at Trump's inauguration. "In looking at the history of inaugural fundraising, the money mostly comes from corporate sources — corporate treasuries and corporate senior managers — and in very large donations," said Holman, adding "almost no inaugural donations come in small amounts under $200." There are no access packages for small donors, Holman said. "That means for nearly all of America who cannot afford a Trump package, we will be on the outside looking in during the Trump Inauguration."

For the first count, there was an alleged conspiracy to corrupt from June 1991 to June 1992, with RR agreeing to pay US$18.8 million (Bt666 million) to regional and other agents representing the Thai government and THAI so as to favour RR engines. According to the statement, THAI purchased six Boeing 777s and RR sold Trent 800 engines to THAI for these aircraft, with $1 million available for each aircraft equipped with the RR engines for the purpose of influencing the buy decision. Eventually, RR paid $8 million or $1.33 million for each of the aircraft’s engines. To conceal the illegal act, it was suggested that only one copy of the memo on this matter should be kept, while the rest were to be destroyed, as the payment was described as a “success fee”. In addition to this fixed amount, agents were also paid a separate commission percentage, with the first 50 per cent portion paid to agents to show enthusiasm for the deal. According to the statement, RR won the first contract to provide its engines to the six planes in November 1991 and commission payments were made from December 1991 to February 1992. By the end of Feb 1992, it said $4.75 million was paid to agents for the engine deal, which later expanded to 8 aircraft, resulting in an additional payment of $2.66 million. The second count of alleged wrongdoing involving THAI’s purchase of RR engines happened between March 1992 and March 1997. In this second order of RR engines, the British firm agreed to pay $10.3 million to agents, a portion of which was intended for THAI employees as the national flag carrier purchased another six B777 and RR wanted to get the engine order for these aircraft. In March 1992, it was agreed that the so-called “success fee” would be Bt135 million or about $5.29 million. However, the order did not go ahead and two years later, in 1994, RR paid another $500,000 to the agents despite the lack of success. Later, there were talks on a fee to be paid to the agents, and it was raised from 1 per cent to 2 per cent. ‘Marketing expenses’ In October 1995 a senior THAI officer asked if the payment of $1 million per aircraft would be paid within 30 days if the airline made the second order for RR engines. Later, the board of THAI approved a purchase order for six B777 aircraft and in April 1996 RR was told to pay the higher amount of $1.33 million, as promised earlier by the agents. In January 1997, an internal memo shows $7.14 million would be paid upon the Thai government’s approval of the deal and the amount would be distributed domestically. But finally in March the same year, $5.14 million was paid by RR and was referred to as a “marketing expenses”. The third count of alleged wrongdoing happened between April 2004 to February 2005 when THAI placed a third order for RR engines, with the engine-maker agreeing to pay $7.2 million to agents for distribution to individuals in the Thai government and THAI. The airline’s order for new aircraft materialised in late 2004 and agents requested an extra commission fee of 4 per cent, so overall commission fees rose to 8 per cent. Citing competition from Pratt and Whitney, another engine-maker, RR was asked to give an 8 per cent fee to win the deal. In July 2004, THAI’s board approved the purchase of another six B777 and two Airbus 340 using RR engines. In October 2004, there was an agreement for an additional seven spare engines. And in January 2005, RR paid $3.7 million to agents for engines to be used on six B77 aircraft and another two spare engines. In addition, RR also paid an additional 2 per cent commission fee on the sales of all seven spare engines. Altogether, $7.1 million was paid to agents for the sale of T800 and T500 engines provided by RR.

The deal will come after Iran, which had not directly purchased a Western-built plane in nearly 40 years, signed contracts with Europe's Airbus (AIR.PA) and U.S. rival Boeing (BA.N) last year to purchase about 180 jets. That became possible after an agreement between Iran and six major powers lifted most international sanctions imposed on Tehran, in exchange for Iran curbing its nuclear program. "We have concluded the negotiations and we should sign the contract imminently," ATR Chief Executive Christian Scherer said. Scherer was responding to some Iranian media reports on Friday that ATR had already announced the signature of the keenly awaited deal.   Iranian officials said in December that a deal for 20 twin-engine turboprop ATR 72-600 aircraft was close. IranAir and ATR have spent months negotiating a firm order for 20 ATR 72-600 aircraft worth 540 million euros ($576 million) at list prices, with options for another 20. All three manufacturers have received U.S. Treasury export licenses to sell to Iran, a step required even for European firms since all modern Western aircraft rely on many U.S. parts.     Even so, industry sources say all three may need further approvals or extended cover in order to complete deliveries.      That is likely to re-focus industry attention on the direction taken by U.S. President Donald Trump, who has voiced opposition to the nuclear sanctions deal.

Courtesy of District 15   Submitted by District 15 Kimball Hill School, Rolling Meadows, was recently awarded a $5,000 grant from the Boeing Company Employees Community Fund of Chicago. This grant will fund the expansion of Kimball Hill's Blessings in a Backpack program, doubling the number of students it will serve. Across District 15, the Blessings in a Backpack program provides nearly 300 students in need at three different schools with enough groceries to feed themselves each weekend. A group of volunteers stepped up to start the Blessings in a Backpack program at Kimball Hill School last winter. Supported by the school's Kids Hope mentors and a number of volunteers from Community Church of Rolling Meadows, the Kimball Hill effort kicked off by sending these groceries home with about 50 students each Friday afternoon. Now, thanks to this Boeing grant, the school will increase the number of students who benefit from this program to 100. "And we could go even higher because the need is there," said Tracey Wrobel, Kimball Hill School principal. "Thank you, Boeing Company Employees Community Fund of Chicago. This grant will help us sustain our program to meet the needs of many of our students." • Submit 'Your News' at www.dailyherald.com/share.

Posted 21 Jan 2017 00:00 Boeing Co's logo is seen above the front doors of its largest jetliner factory in Everett, Washington, U.S. January 13, 2017. REUTERS/Alwyn Scott Enlarge Caption  Email More A A SEATTLE: The International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers said it planned to petition on Friday for about 2,850 workers at Boeing Co's assembly plant in South Carolina to vote on union representation. The petition with the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), which had been expected, likely would allow workers to hold a secret-ballot election in the next few months. On average, votes take place about three weeks after a petition is filed, IAM spokesman Mike Evans said. The union called off a vote in April 2015 after what it called "political interference" from state lawmakers and "misinformation" spread among workers. The union, in a regulatory filing on Friday, said it sought to address concerns about "subjective raises, inconsistent scheduling policies and a lack of respect on the shop floor." Evans said the union was convinced workers were ready to vote for a union and that an election would be held this year. Boeing said on Friday that a union was not in the "best interest" of its workers in South Carolina. "We believe our teammates deserve to keep their hard-earned money in their pockets while continuing to work with the company to drive meaningful change," Joan Robinson-Berry, Boeing vice president and general manager, South Carolina, said in a statement. South Carolina is a right-to-work state where employees can't be forced to join a union or pay dues even when covered by a union contract. In April 2015, it had the second-lowest union membership in the United States. Boeing's workforce at its main commercial aircraft factories in Washington state is largely unionized. The South Carolina plant, which opened in 2011, makes 787 Dreamliners and is the only Boeing jetliner assembly line outside of Washington state. It is the sole producer of the 787-10, Boeing's largest Dreamliner. The first 787-10 is currently being assembled in South Carolina. It is due for its first flight this year, and the first customer delivery is expected in 2018.

News Business Business Comment BT finds good day to bury news of price hikes The noise surrounding Donald Trump's inauguration won't stop questions being raised over whether the rises can really be justified given the state of Britain's digital infrastructure James Moore @JimMooreJourno Friday 20 January 2017 16:17 BST Click to follow The Independent Online BT Sport, and a whole lot more, is getting more expensive Getty Images BT could hardly have timed its announcement of price hikes any better.  Friday is generally a good day to bury bad news, but with Donald Trump’s inauguration, made this particular Friday just about perfect.   I was told it wasn’t intentional, and the timing was set to reflect the fact that customers will receive letters informing them of the new tariffs on Monday. But even if that’s true, the happy accident surely ought to be worth a bonus for the PR department.  Read more BT to provide homeless helpline free for its first three years BT needs a harder kick from OfCom over Openreach BT ordered to legally split from Openreach network in Ofcom ruling Particularly given the heat the price hikes might normally have injected into the ongoing controversy surrounding BT’s broadband infrastructure company OpenReach, that most other providers have to use to serve their customers. Not to mention the fierce debate about the state of Britain’s digital infrastructure more generally, and the feeling that the companies involved in it could do a lot more about improving it than they are doing.  For the record, BT’s broadband customers will see rises of between 5 and 6 per cent across their respective bundles. BT TV customers will pay £3.50 a month for BT Sport, which had been free for broadband customers. Landline customers will see the cost of their plans increased, call charges will rise by 1p a minute.  To soften the blow, line rental has been frozen at £18.99 and the cost of subscribing to BT TV held. BT Basic, aimed at lower income customers, has been frozen for three years. There are also plans to roll out automatic compensation when the company fails to live up to service commitments, and some other improvements and offers.  But BT should still have a care. The company will tell you these price rises are part of its retail business, and that its rivals have also raised their prices. True enough.  However, that won’t stop people asking where the money is going given the state of that digital infrastructure and the complaints about OpenReach, that rivals want spun off, and OfCom wants to see made a legally separate entity with its own board within the BT group.  You may remember that in December, the Government’s National Infrastructure Commission found that Britain has worse mobile internet coverage than Romania, Albania and Peru, and said the nation is languishing in the digital slow lane. Broadband coverage in rural areas remains patchy, complaints about OpenReach are common.  The customer is unlikely to see the distinction between the charges they pay for their retail service, and these wholesale issues. And why should they? It won’t come as much comfort that BT isn’t alone in having questions to answer when it comes to mobile broadband. Its customers will just feel cross.  Who can blame them? Cross enough to make them forget about the Donald? Quite possibly. Even on a Friday.  Business picture of the day 33 show all Business picture of the day 1/33 Tesco to buy wholesaler Booker in £3.7bn deal to create 'UK's leading food business' - Friday January 27 Britain's biggest retailer announced that it was merging with Booker, the UK's top food wholesaler, in a £3.7bn deal.

And why someone with authority doesn’t do something to force the issue. Someone, in regulation, or in Government, or in both.  The current situation is a disgrace, and this latest batch of price rises can only serve to underline that, regardless of any distinction between retail and wholesale, land based broadband, or mobile broadband, or the efforts BT has made to try and sweeten the pill.

Associated Press NORTH CHARLESTON, S.C. — The International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM) today will file a petition with the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) to hold a secret-ballot union election for approximately 2,850 production employees at the Boeing Co. in North Charleston, South Carolina. Workers have remained in contact with IAM organizers in recent months regarding numerous workplace concerns that remain unaddressed, including subjective raises, inconsistent scheduling policies and a lack of respect on the shop floor. “Boeing workers just want to be treated with the respect they deserve,” said IAM Boeing SC Lead Organizer Mike Evans. “Why should they be subject to a different set of standards and rules than folks building the exact same plane in Seattle?” The filing comes after the IAM was forced to postpone a scheduled April 22, 2015 union election due to unprecedented political interference on the part of South Carolina lawmakers and the rampant spread of misinformation among Boeing workers. “It was impossible to hold a free and fair election in an environment so ripe with mistruths and outright lies. Unfortunately, we’ve now heard numerous reports of the company walking people off the job for seeking a voice,” said Evans. “Despite the obstacles, we feel this group is ready to take a stand. The only way to secure the workplace improvements they deserve is through a union-negotiated collective bargaining agreement.” The NLRB is expected to issue election dates and locations in the coming weeks. The IAM is committed to ensuring Boeing workers have the opportunity to make their voice heard in an atmosphere free of intimidation and harassment. “I can unequivocally say there will be a vote this time around,” said Evans. “We’ve met with numerous workers at Boeing in recent months and are confident they will see through any attempts by the company to divert attention away from the numerous workplace issues that need fixed.” The IAM is the U.S.’s largest aerospace union, representing approximately 600,000 members at the likes of Lockheed Martin, General Electric and United Technologies. The IAM represents more than 35,000 Boeing employees at 24 locations nationwide.

"Following" : "Follow"}} January 20, 2017 10:36am   Comments Share: Citron Research released a Friday memo warning of politically-induced turbulence in the aerospace industry particularly expected to affect TransDigm Group Incorporated (NYSE: TDG). President-elect Donald Trump has already taken efforts to lower prices for military aircraft and laid pre-inauguration groundwork through meetings with Boeing Co (NYSE: BA) and Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE: LMT). The two companies subsequently vowed to lower prices for the Air Force One fleet and the F-35 fighter jet program. Citron analyst Andrew Left expects TransDigm to be swept in the draft. @CitronResearch tweeted: “Citron publishes the first timely story of the Trump Presidency. Transdigm $TDG has a target on its back. We expose the gouging of the USA.” Left noted in the memo that the cost cuts of Boeing will heavily affect subcontractor TransDigm, which will also take a more direct hit in its contract with the Department of Defense. Left predicted the targeting of TransDigm particularly based on its “egregious” price raises and a business model that has accrued a “sky-high debt load.” TransDigm, he said, could soon become the Valeant Pharmaceuticals Intl Inc (NYSE: VRX) of the aerospace industry. As of this report, TransDigm was trading down 10 percent on the day. Posted-In: News Short Sellers Politics Analyst Ratings Movers Tech Media Trading Ideas Best of Benzinga © 2017 Benzinga.com.

Pegasus plans to add at least 18 aircraft over the next three years. Published: 18:41 January 20, 2017 Bloomberg   SMALL MEDIUM LARGE ISTANBUL: Turkey’s Pegasus Airlines is accelerating a shift to more fuel-efficient A320neo planes ordered from Airbus Group SE as a spate of terrorist attacks in the country hurts demand and curbs revenue. The low-cost carrier, owned by Istanbul-based private equity firm Esas Holding AS, will start selling older Boeing Co. 737 jets following Turkey’s worst year for tourism in a decade, Chief Executive Officer Mehmet Nane said in an interview. Pegasus, which currently operates 62 737-800s and a mix of 20 original-generation A320s and re-engined Neos, plans to add at least 18 aircraft over the next three years while eliminating the Boeing planes and reducing the average age of its fleet to 5.2 years from 5.6. “Our plan to roll out our fleet to Airbus from Boeing by 2020 still holds,” Nane said. “We are aiming to have 100-plus aircraft, the final number depending on the pace of the fleet phase-out.” Pegasus now aims to take five A320neos this year, two more than originally planned, Chief Financial Officer Serhan Ulga said separately at the 2017 Global Airfinance conference in Dublin. That will lift the number of Neos in operation to nine following a 2012 order for 75 plus 25 options. The planes consume 15 per cent less fuel than the A320 “classic,” according to Airbus. Shares of Pegasus rose as much as 3.8 per cent to 15.23 liras before closing 2.7 per cent higher at 15.07 liras in Istanbul. The carrier will also this year get two 737-800s as part of an agreement reached in 2015, while leasing out six Boeings with crews, four to Pakistan International Airlines Corp. Ltd and two to Saudi Arabia’s Flynas LCC, in order to rein in capacity. Nane said that more such deals may follow. “I am optimistic that 2017 will be a better year in terms of traveller numbers than 2016,” the CEO said, adding that passenger traffic could show a double-digit increase, versus an 8.1 per cent gain a year earlier. Last year “saw the worst of all scenarios,” Nane said, referring to the terror attacks and a botched coup attempt in July that prompted a purge of more than 150,000 people and 800 companies, acting as a further brake on travel. Esas Holding has no plans at either board or shareholder level to dispose of Pegasus, the CEO said, responding to speculation about the carrier’s ownership. Istanbul’s Sabiha Gokcen airport, the Pegasus base, will get a second runway next year, though the existing landing strip will then undergo maintenance before both are in operation from 2019. The hub is operated by Malaysia Airports Holdings Bhd. — Bloomberg More from Aviation Dubai Duty Free eyes new airport for growth Japan’s ANA profit soars Qantas to expand international unit Dreamliner turns rainmaker for Boeing Embraer hopes Trump to clear Iran jet sale US airlines better off competing: analyst Dubai airport offers to help improve US airports Dubai International registers record passengers tags from this storySaudi Arabia follow this tag on MGN filed underGulfNewsBusinessAviation tagsSaudi Arabia follow this tag on MGN+ MGN Also In AviationDubai Duty Free eyes new airport for growth Business Gallery Highlights: SIHH luxury watch show Highlights: Detroit Auto Show Business Videos PlayAbu Dhabi Ship Building enjoys growing success Strata UAE leads aerospace manufacturing FOLLOW US Most Popular ViewedCommentedGalleriesVideos 01Dubai Duty Free eyes new airport for growth 02Emirates cuts fares for US flights 03Etihad Airways chief James Hogan to step down 04Japan’s ANA profit soars 05Qantas to expand international unit 20Images Highlights: SIHH luxury watch show Jan 18, 2017 9Images Pictures: Mohammad Bin Zayed in Mumbai Feb 13, 2016 34Images Dubai Shopping Festival 2012 in pictures Jan 31, 2012 10Images LG unveils flagship V20 smartphone Sep 07, 2016 Play Abu Dhabi Ship Building enjoys growing success Nov 24, 2016 Play Strata UAE leads aerospace manufacturing Oct 25, 2016 Play Inside Emirates airline's engineering hangar Sep 20, 2015 Play Emirati who created 2 successful companies Jan 02, 2016 Explore the UAE Find the right airport Currency Converter first-currency currencyAEDDinarRupee= first-currency currencyINRDinarRupee Most Popular on Gulf News Mohammad concludes three-day India visit No visa-free facility for Indians here...

Credit: NASA/Bill Ingalls A lot has changed in the fields of spaceflight and exploration since President Barack Obama came to power eight years ago. The moon is no longer an official destination for NASA astronauts, for example, and the commercial spaceflight industry has boomed to the point that multiple private spaceships are flying cargo to the International Space Station (ISS) — and two should soon start ferrying crew to and from the station as well. President Obama doesn't deserve all the credit (or blame, depending on your viewpoint) for such shifts, of course, but they will be part of his legacy. Here's Space.com's admittedly premature look at how space fans may remember the 44th president. [Gallery: President Obama and NASA] Don't fly me to the moon When President Obama took office in January 2009, NASA was working to get astronauts to the moon by 2020, as part of George W. Bush's Constellation program. Constellation envisioned using the moon as a stepping stone to Mars, though the program didn't map out any crewed Red Planet missions in detail. In May 2009, the Obama administration ordered an independent review of the agency's human-spaceflight plans, which came to be known as the Augustine Commission (after the review committee's chairman, former Lockheed Martin CEO Norm Augustine). The commission's final report, published in October 2009, deemed Constellation to be significantly over budget and behind schedule. As a result, in 2010, President Obama cancelled the five-year-old program, instructing NASA to instead get astronauts to a near-Earth asteroid by 2025, and then on to the vicinity of Mars by the mid-2030s. To make all this happen, the agency is developing the Orion crew capsule (a Constellation holdover) and a gigantic new rocket called the Space Launch System (SLS). NASA has also devised the Asteroid Redirect Mission (ARM), which aims to pluck a boulder off of an asteroid using a robotic probe. This spacecraft will then haul the boulder to lunar orbit, where astronauts can visit the space rock. Orion flew for the first time in December 2014, launching atop a United Launch Alliance Delta IV Heavy rocket on an uncrewed mission to Earth orbit and back. SLS should be ready to fly in 2018; the rocket's maiden launch is scheduled for that year and will send an uncrewed Orion on a mission around the moon. [Photos: NASA's 1st Orion Spacecraft Test Flight] Astronauts will fly on an Orion/SLS mission for the first time in 2021, if all goes according to plan. A crewed mission to visit the captured asteroid boulder will follow in the mid-2020s, NASA officials have said. The decision to shift from the moon to an asteroid (and, ultimately, to an asteroid boulder) as the near-term destination for NASA astronauts has been controversial. Last year, for example, the U.S. House of Representatives' Appropriations Committee proposed denying funding to ARM. The change has also made collaboration with commercial and international partners more difficult, said Scott Pace, director of the Space Policy Institute at George Washington University. NASA officials have stressed that such collaboration is a key priority of the larger "Journey to Mars" project. "Mars is so difficult and so challenging that it wasn't really possible for people to feel they could do something" in cooperation with NASA, Pace told Space.com. "You could talk about commercial cargo delivery to the moon. You couldn't really talk about commercial cargo delivery to Mars." The rise of private spaceflight Commercial spaceflight has taken off during the Obama presidency. For example, two different American companies, SpaceX and Orbital ATK, are now flying uncrewed resupply missions to the ISS for NASA. In addition, SpaceX and Boeing hold multibillion-dollar contracts to fly NASA astronauts to and from the orbiting lab, and both companies should start doing so in the next year or two, NASA officials have said. (NASA has been dependent on Russia to provide such taxi services since the retirement of the space shuttle fleet in July 2011, a move set in motion by President George W. Bush in 2004.) Such public-private cooperation kicked off with the announcement of NASA's Commercial Orbital Transportation Services program in January 2006. But it was "turbocharged" under the Obama administration, which made the development of private crew-carrying vehicles a priority, said Casey Dreier, director of space policy at the nonprofit Planetary Society. "That, to me, is the biggest legacy [of the Obama administration] — fully embracing the potential of commercial launch capabilities, and really, really making that a priority, and fighting for it against a lot of opposition from Congress," Dreier told Space.com. "I don't think commercial crew was fully funded at NASA until 2015." Other developments under Obama's watch have been key as well, said Eric Stallmer, president of the nonprofit Commercial Spaceflight Federation. He cited extending the life of the International Space Station through at least 2024 and the confirmation that U.S. companies can own the resources they mine from asteroids and other celestial objects. Both of these provisions are part of the Commercial Space Launch Competitiveness Act, which the House of Representatives passed and President Obama signed in late 2015. Lots of things are happening in private spaceflight beyond NASA-funded ISS cargo and crew missions. Blue Origin, the company founded by Amazon.com chief Jeff Bezos, has said it's nearly ready to fly paying customers to and from suborbital space, for example. Virgin Galactic is making strides toward the same goal. Some of these developments would probably have occurred no matter who was in the White House, because private spaceflight was already on the rise, Stallmer said. (More venture-capital money was invested in commercial spaceflight in 2015 than in the previous 10 years combined, he said.) But the Obama administration deserves credit for creating an environment in which such advances can take place, Stallmer added. "I think it's safe to say that Obama did foster a burgeoning private space sector," he said. "I think they were very cooperative with the private and commercial space entities that are out there." [The Biggest Space Missions to Watch in 2017] Earth science, planetary science and more President Obama's space-science legacy is perhaps a bit more complicated. In these tough budget times, the outgoing administration seems to have prioritized Earth science and full funding of the $8.8 billion James Webb Space Telescope over robotic-exploration missions, Dreier said. He pointed to a $300 million cut to NASA's planetary science funding in the White House's proposed budget for fiscal year 2013 as an example. The planetary-exploration cupboard therefore looks to be somewhat bare in the near future, two recently announced asteroid missions notwithstanding, Dreier said. There are no uncrewed NASA Mars missions on the books beyond the Mars 2020 rover, he pointed out, and, in a year or so, the agency won't have an active probe at Jupiter or Saturn for the first time in two decades (excepting a nine-month stretch in 2003 and 2004). The Cassini spacecraft, which has been orbiting Saturn since July 2004, will wrap up its work this September, and the Jupiter-orbiting Juno probe's mission is scheduled to end in early 2018. NASA is developing a mission to the Jovian moon Europa, but that effort's not slated to launch until the mid-2020s. "You have a generation of missions about to end and nothing ready to replace them for five to 10 years," Dreier said. But it's possible that there could have been more happening now on NASA's robotic-exploration front if the White House had cooperated to a greater extent with Congress, Dreier said. "They almost wouldn't believe that Congress was willing to give them extra money on planetary science, but year after year after year, Congress added money to planetary science, particularly in the House," he said. "I think there are a lot of lost opportunities there." Pace agreed, lamenting the lack of "new starts" in NASA's exploration pipeline. But he said the Obama administration deserves credit in some other areas, such as space defense. "Putting more money into DoD [the Department of Defense] and recognizing the Russian and Chinese counterspace threat — that's, I think, in the positive column, so I hope that continues," Pace said. "Most of the Obama space policy, I would argue, is actually quite reasonable," he added. Pace did have some major caveats, however. He's not a fan of the move away from the moon for human exploration, and he said the Obama administration employed an overly broad definition of "commercial spaceflight," resulting in some confusion about the roles the private and public sectors should play. Early days yet All of the above should be taken with a large grain of salt. It will probably take years to fully assess just how the Obama administration shaped U.S. spaceflight and exploration, partly because decisions made by the Trump administration and other future officeholders will affect that legacy. Sometimes, the clarity this temporal distance provides can lead to surprising conclusions. As an example, Pace cited presidents John F. Kennedy and Richard Nixon. "I would make an argument that, actually, Nixon has had a longer-term legacy on human spaceflight," Pace said. "People remember Kennedy and going to the moon, but it's Nixon and his choices and nonchoices about [the space] shuttle in 1972 that have arguably been with us for 40 years," Pace added, referring to Nixon's decision to base NASA's human-spaceflight activities on the space shuttle program, without any distant destinations in mind. Nobody has set foot on the moon, or been anywhere beyond low-Earth orbit, since the Apollo 17 mission ended in December 1972.

It you know there couple moments Susan one is right at the conclusion of the oath of office. The Chief Justice congratulates the president the now president. And the band strikes up hailed as the chief in the 21 gun salute and all of that and it. Cameras will be panning the crowd and there'll be a lot of jubilation there I mean that's that's a very emotional moment the other emotional moment for me. Is later on in the day. Win the outgoing president President Obama and his family. Will go out in the South Lawn they get and the helicopter. To take them to wherever they're they're going. And of course he'll be accompanied by. Donald Trump and maligning and probably the rest of the trump family in no way even though that's. That that is as much as anything. Symbolic of the peaceful transition of power you know you don't see. You won't see President Obama on the podium transferring power he'll be sitting there watching the Chief Justice administered the oath of office but you will see you know the outgoing president right into the sunset then on the helicopter and you'll see the the new president waiting to that's that's always a very touching moment for me. It is that the optics so of it all that you kinda like you mention it all there and I would guess that your not surprised to see this but is this the first time that you can remember inauguration day. Being sole political and politically charged when. Oh yeah I would certainly did look like everything about this campaign cycle concluding with the inauguration. It is you know stuff on steroids. Everything has been so accentuated. The negatives in the campaign. The the the controversy surrounding the campaign and now the inauguration with a protesters and all. We just seeing a tweet from Donald Trump this morning on his regular account he says it all begins today I'll see you at 11 o'clock for the swearing him. The movement continues the work begins not a surprise at all that is tweeting hasn't. No it well well what's what's nice is he's not taking a shot at any I mean it's it's a nice inspirational message. I mean that's. That's absurd thing that in the past. You know has come out. In one form or another it's now you know it's now 2017. And were doing it on Twitter so I have no problem with that message. We were with Carol calabrese just a few minutes ago and he said expects to in his speech today. Here from the same down trumpet we've heard from all along the Donald Trump's going to remain the same. I think a lot of today though that the way to the office kind of comes on you win yes if you like it those briefings you finally stepped in might that change. Boeing to build from we'll we'll see I mean the the addresses then go on over I'm sure perhaps trump wrote that perhaps he didn't. But certainly a lot of eyes have seen and I think it'll be an appropriate address the question is whether he goes off script and and gets off the teleprompter and make some some comments mean what's gonna be interesting is if there any any disturbances in the crowd. And you have to believe that that's a possibility how he reacts I mean he would be wise to do is just going ahead and and delivered the address stop and say get out. It again well yeah that would that would not be a good start to its is. The presidency. You know the important thing to remember however is this the inauguration there's a lot of focus on it but candlelight. The winning you know. A couple I mean it's it's it's nice their delegates gathered at the reception and it's big party. But the real work starts after that in a marriage you know it's it's it's what happens after. And what happens next week is much more important than what's happening today. You know because there are aware that there's a lot on his plate. How soon do you expect him. To get down to business and and do what he says he would do on day one. I well I think it'll be. Pretty much immediately. I mean Michael Capuano has told us that for more than a year. His people of the going over executive orders of the Obama administration that they will repeal on day one and I got to believe that that all happen. You know there might be a symbolic one or two today year handful today I think most of them the indication is it'll happen on Monday. Or is that realistic. To expect a lot of these in the first week be a writer executive guy every executive order to swipe of a pen you don't need to get this through congress. This is that repeal and replace obamacare which is going to be tough I'll tell you that's going to be Dicey. Repealing is easy replacing. Is tougher because he had to get people to agree on everything. Keep America great is the trademark that that trump has already. I guess he's got the trademark for four years from now so he's very thinking about a second term. TI and by the way the runner up to keep America great Ali haven't done inside information was. Toby Keith is indeed country music and encourage violence I I think you how it's easy I'm sure I'm sure you were up all night watching that concert violate a bright Willie Nelson in this country right because I love Walid reeling off as punch all right I just wondering if you're good. Harry. It in the next few minutes here on WB and Kevin Harvick from kinesis talent Kevin Harvick is in studio kinesis college political science professor. Kevin. The importance of Donald Trump's first two years in office. He. The first two years is is critical and it's it's not just for trumpet you you look at giving you think about what you remember Reagan for you remember Reagan. Four here is that reaganomics is tax cut the supply side picked. He did that his first couple years after that it was pretty much downhill and second it second term. We got bogged down and Iran Contra and all that. If they get Clinton Clinton came in and the first two years. He did pay a tax increase. And he was only able to get them through I remember it passed by one vote in the democratic House of Representatives. Fast forward when did Obama. Pass his signature program it was his first two years. Because after the first two years. You're probably gonna lose some members. Of of your party in congress in the mid term elections mean right now trump has the a luxury of having both houses of congress. Being Republican. We have you know comfortable margins. But that's at the change in two year's midterm elections the parties that are in power normally get lose some seats if if they don't get slaughtered and and that's regardless of what happens in those two years that's just kind of how the it or did. Again historically the first two years are the most important of any administration so what's it's important that he get off to a good start even the first 100 days for trump tower perk purse 100 days coming out you go back there Roosevelt when the term first hundred days you mean you think of the first. Hundred days of FDR's administration that's when so much debt got done yet. This next next year two very important. Again he has congress on his side. You don't know whether that's going to be the case in three years. Rain is in the forecast for Washington today but president elect trump says that's the case he doesn't care if it really pores that's okay. Because people will realize it's my real hair and that's okay. My PMS. But they're gonna see that despite. Didn't you like then about about trump can I. I. I certainly do but I think he should be concerned if it rains because you and we are convict 1841. When William Henry Harrison gave me to our inaugural address. In the rain it was a cold rain and then he wrote a horse in the inaugural parade. And he didn't Wear cold he didn't Wear a hat and 31 days later he died of pneumonia. Yeah but you know for those two hours he looked real tough bill it was it was an awesome two hours yes good. Well tell him to get to our city and and my understanding is that at the inaugural. Bald it was a country music band. Really what what kind of country you know back then was so those are your thing good well. Great deal there I don't know we'll you're the country music fan Bryan. Hey. Did you know this. Theodore Roosevelt was the youngest president to be sworn into office at the age of 42 here in buffalo right here in buffalo buffalo as a unique place. In inauguration. History. If you I'd take any pride and then. Yeah of course well. Yet it you know them the pride is kind of tempered because the only reason he was sworn in here. Because his predecessor William McKinley was assassinated here so yet at the recruitment task time plus tragedy yeah. You know they if anyone's driving by buffalo City Hall today it's got to be like one of those double take moment she tried by the moment time that the statues of former president's Millard Fillmore in Grover Cleveland are right there. Yeah yeah. This is the data notice them or if you're like me and it shortly going to be doing kinesis Khaled and me walk go over in the noon hour to. The grave of Millard Fillmore. Don't turn to right yeah he's right. There in force long Rebecca with more of Catherine Hardwicke ands it's not just. The presidential transition of power but there's a whole full weeks of staff at the White House who switches hands today too I mean you eat you think of it it's not just. The President Obama going to present trumpets its a whole lot of other people now to be sure there are career. Public servants who will carry on from administration to administration to administration. But a lot of people at the top beginning with a capital level secretaries of White House staff are gonna change in an instant. It's a time when we really are most vulnerable I mean if you were an enemy of the United States that he went again day to do something against us. I mean you talk about the handing off to nuclear football I mean there's a lot more to it and they just that one administration to the next. Arm and and you know I mean it's it's especially important there's cooperation between the outgoing administration and mean going administration. You look at times when you know maybe we've fallen short remember when when Clinton handed off to bush 43. You know there were a lot of pranks played in the in the west wing they took all that remember was W George W. Bush they took all the w.s off the of key words. And there was a lot of stuff they did with the answering machines and things like that. It was just you know it was just terrible because if if something did happen. And media needed to type a memo with a W you know our records and direction if someone. You know you wouldn't have it and they took took a day or two recovered it was just very irresponsible. Now in when bush handed off to Obama went smoothly and all indications are that there's been a lot of cooperation and an inordinate amount of cooperation. Between the Obama people and the and the trump people and that's the way it should be. And I don't know I would I would probably be the worst Stafford to leave the White House believing you know. Well it's a screen sandwiches aren't held atmospheric glow of the reasons I'm glad you're here and not there I if I sleep better at night because of that brand. You know it just realize it though who's in charge today at noon. It like it out with those cabinet post the ones that the nominees that are not consider. Are there are career. I mean that's that's been taking care of I don't know the specifics but they're career people who carry on from one administration to the next and and you know. They've got it covered. But it's still that's still a very you know very. Tense time I'm sure all right will you be watching with students today are how will I will be I'm in between classes I yeah I'm sure some of us a league huddled around the television set. And I've got a class at 1 o'clock hopefully the inaugural addresses over night and I'm sure will be. And yeah its it's a big day you go out to talk about there there is a lot to talk about well you know. It's not gonna be a boring for years. There's no question about it could be very good he could be very bad it will not be boring there's no question about that our rights act Kevin Harvick thank you so much for joining us. advertise with us Poll One week into the Trump Presidency, what's your assessment?   Better than expected   About what I expecrted   Worse than I expected   View Results Top Stories Audio Get it Now 03/23/11 10:06 AM Posted 2137 days 12 hrs 46 mins ago WBEN iPhone App 03/23/11 10:06 AM Posted 2137 days 12 hrs 46 mins ago Perks 03/23/11 10:06 AM Posted 2137 days 12 hrs 46 mins ago Contests 03/23/11 10:05 AM Posted 2137 days 12 hrs 47 mins ago Photo Galleries 03/23/11 10:07 AM Posted 2137 days 12 hrs 45 mins ago RSS Center 03/23/11 10:07 AM Posted 2137 days 12 hrs 45 mins ago Contact Us   |   Advertise With Us   |   Jobs   |   EEO Public File   |   Privacy Policy   |   Terms & Conditions   |   Contest Rules   |   Internships   |   Copyright Notice

News Business Business News Ford trials plug-in hybrid vans in London to help tackle air pollution and climate change Britain is banking on electric and hybrid vehicles to help cut emissions of high levels of toxic air pollutants that have left London and other cities in breach of European standards Alex Morales Friday 20 January 2017 15:10 BST Click to follow The Independent Online The Government is seeking to lower nitrogen oxide emissions, particularly from diesel cars Reuters Ford will trial plug-in hybrid vans in London in an effort to accelerate the uptake of low-emissions vehicles and tackle climate change and air pollution. Aided by £4.7m of UK government funding, the vehicle manufacturer will test 20 of the vehicles, which mainly operate using an electric battery but can fall back on a combustion engine, Ford said in an e-mailed statement.  Britain is banking on electric and hybrid vehicles to help cut emissions of both greenhouse gases and toxic air pollutants that have left London and other cities in breach of European standards. Ford aims to become the first car maker to mass-manufacture plug-in hybrid vans in 2019, and the London trial is as much about seeing how well suited the Transit Custom model is to ‘White Van Man,’ as how it operates in a city environment, according to the president of Ford Europe Jim Farley. Read more Mexicans blame Trump as they rue Ford's decision to shut plant “We’re as interested to learn about the telematics as the driving habits,” Farley said in an interview on Friday. “Tradesmen are very different than Amazon delivery drivers and very different than Transport for London users, so we don’t know if the range is just right,” he said, referring to the capital’s transport authority, which will be participating in the trial. The van runs on electricity for the majority of city trips and has a range of about 30 miles (50 kilometres) on a single battery charge. It’ll be trialled by commercial fleets across London.

Electric cars will “remain niche” until at least 2020, the panel said.  “You could just say we’re going to let this market evolve, but our view is we need to shape and accelerate it,” climate change minister Nick Hurd said in an interview on Friday. “There are three reasons for that. One is the carbon agenda, the second is the clean air agenda, which is critical now in places like London. But the third dimension is industrial for us.” Barriers to take-up of the vehicles include a dearth of charging points, public doubts about the travel range of the vehicles, and their high up-front costs. Jaguar Land Rover said last year it wants to build electric cars in Britain if the government can overcome shortfalls in power supply.

News Business Business News Davos: IMF Chief warns against cutting taxes and regulation 'to the bottom' referencing Donald Trump's policies Christine Lagarde said that cuts in taxes, regulation and trade could have 'devastating effects' Josie Cox Business Editor Friday 20 January 2017 14:30 BST Click to follow The Independent Online Ms Lagarde is not the first delegate of this year’s conference to issue a warning in a direct nod to Mr Trump Reuters Christine Lagarde, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, has used the last day of the World Economic Forum in Davos to warn of the risks the world faces from engaging in a “race to the bottom” on taxes, regulation and trade.  In a direct reference to some of incoming US President Donald Trump’s expected policies, Ms Lagarde said that major cuts in those three areas could have “devastating effects” on global economies this year. Read more The threat to the world economy that no one's talking about “If the disruptions we are expecting for 2017 as a result of what has happened in 2016 prove to be all negative and we are to end up in a race to the bottom on the tax front, on the trade front and on the financial regulation front, then that for me would be a really big black swan that would have devastating effects for countries other than those that are likely to cause it,” she said.  During his presidential campaign, Mr Trump announced that financial reforms put in place in the wake of the 2007-2009 global financial crisis were hurting the economy and that he would dismantle the majority of them if he came into office. He has also implied that he will introduce major tax cuts and take a harsher stance when negotiating gobal trade deals.

News Business Business News Uber agrees to pay $20m over claims it lied to drivers about how much they could earn The company claimed that the average driver in New York earned over $90,000 - US authorities disagreed Ben Chapman Friday 20 January 2017 12:57 BST Click to follow The Independent Online Uber has agreed to pay $20m to resolve charges that it duped drivers with exaggerated claims about how much they could earn and underestimated how much it would cost to finance their cars. The US Federal Trade Commission alleged that most Uber drivers were earning far less in 18 major cities than Uber said that they could earn on its website.  In a statement published on the Thursday, the FTC said Uber claimed drivers’ annual median income was more than $90,000 (£73,355) in New York and over $74,000 in San Francisco. True earnings in those cities were $61,000 and $53,000 respectively, the FTC alleged. Less than 10 per cent of all drivers in those cities earned the yearly income Uber touted, the regulator said. Read more Black-cab drivers have started a propaganda war against Uber The FTC also asserted that drivers paid substantially more to rent or lease cars from Uber than the company had claimed and offered worse rates than drivers could obtain elsewhere, despite claims that it provided “the best financing offers available”. The statement covers claims Uber made from late 2013 until 2015 while trying to recruit more drivers to expand its service and remain ahead of its main rival, Lyft. “Many consumers sign up to drive for Uber, but they shouldn’t be taken for a ride about their earnings potential or the cost of financing a car through Uber,” said Jessica Rich, director of the FTC’s bureau of consumer protection said. “We’ve made many improvements to the driver experience over the last year and will continue to focus on ensuring that Uber is the best option for anyone looking to earn money on their own schedule,” the San Francisco-based company said in a statement, according to the Associated Press.

It is not the first time Uber has been criticised for distorting the truth. In a landmark ruling in October, London employment tribunal judges said the company resorted to "fictions, twisted language, and even brand new terminology" in its contracts.  The tribunal ruled that Uber drivers were are employees, not self-employed contractors as the company had claimed. As such they are entitled to basic rights such as holiday pay and sick pay. The scathing judgment said the "notion that Uber in London is a mosaic of 30,000 small businesses linked by a common 'platform' is in our minds faintly ridiculous".

Born in Astoria, Oregon, to Ethel Tait and George Garrett, he lived there until he left for Yale University on a full scholarship in 1949. Larry was a proud son of the Pacific Northwest. He treasured his small-town childhood and enjoyed returning to Astoria with his family to visit relatives and friends. Larry graduated from Yale School of Engineering with a degree in Industrial Management and an insatiable curiosity for the emerging field of IT. Larry had interrupted his undergraduate studies to join the Air Force as a Russian Language Expert in the Security Forces during the Korean War. He had the good fortune to be stationed outside of London, England where he met his Swiss bride, Lydia Lipp, on a blind date at Royal Festival Hall for a Beethoven concert. It was a good match - they married in 1957 in Switzerland. Their mutual love of music, theater, ballet, and opera had them enjoy performances on local, national, and international stages. Larry’s career took him from the Boeing Company in Seattle to the Computer Sciences Corporation in Eastern Washington, and to the State of Washington’s Department of Information Services in Olympia where he managed large computer centers. He worked for six months in Germany for CSC where he enjoyed sharing European adventures with his young family. Larry retired in 1994. A few years later, he and Lydia moved to Prescott for the sunshine and hiking. For 25 years Larry and Lydia also ran SWISS HIKE, organizing and leading hiking tours for American and Canadian hikers, first in Switzerland then broadening out to the Austrian and Italian Alps. Hundreds enjoyed hiking with Larry and Lydia in less well-known places in these mountains and many hikers became life long friends. Gentle, quiet, and caring, with a keen sense of humor and a warm smile - these are all attributes that those who knew him use. Larry was a beloved and respected spouse, father and grandfather, uncle, colleague, friend, and volunteer. He freely shared his talents with non profit organizations. Asked to be an official Girl Scout cookie taster by a friend quickly led him to finance and board positions on Girl Scout Councils in Washington. Education was always important to him - he fought for school funding and in Olympia, helped Lydia start three AFS chapters for international student exchanges. Through AFS, many foreign and American high school students got the chance to live in various countries, broadening their young minds. After he retired, for many years Larry participated in OLLI (Osher Lifelong Learning Institute) at Yavapai College. Taking and offering classes and working on committees gave meaning to his retirement. Larry and Lydia are longtime members of the Unitarian-Universalist Church and Larry served several congregations through the years, often as finance chair and on governing boards including the local Granite Peak UU Congregation. Travel was an avocation and Larry and his wife were grateful to be able to travel the world. He is mourned by his wife of 59 years, Lydia Garrett-Lipp, daughters Yvonne Garrett (NYC) and Katia Garrett, son-in-law Donald Salzman, granddaughters Garrett and Tait (Washington DC) and niece Vicki Nunenkamp in Oregon. His son, Philip A. Garrett died in 1998. His beloved brother-in-law Victor Nunenkamp, an Air Force veteran pilot, and his sister, Christobel Nunenkamp also predeceased him. A Celebration of Life service will be held at Granite Peak UU Congregation on Saturday, 28th Jan., at 2 p.m. (882 Sunset Avenue, Prescott). In lieu of flowers, contributions in Larry’s honor may be made to the Granite Peak UU Congregation of Prescott (882 Sunset Avenue, Prescott 86305), OLLI at Yavapai College, (1100 E. Sheldon St., Prescott 86301), or Planned Parenthood of Arizona (4751 N 15th Street, Phoenix, AZ 85014). Information provided by survivors.

The petition with the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), which had been expected, likely would allow workers to hold a secret-ballot election in the next few months. On average, votes take place about three weeks after a petition is filed, IAM spokesman Mike Evans said. The union called off a vote in April 2015 after what it called "political interference" from state lawmakers and "misinformation" spread among workers. The union, in a regulatory filing on Friday, said it sought to address concerns about "subjective raises, inconsistent scheduling policies and a lack of respect on the shop floor." Evans said the union was convinced workers were ready to vote for a union and that an election would be held this year. Boeing said on Friday that a union was not in the "best interest" of its workers in South Carolina. "We believe our teammates deserve to keep their hard-earned money in their pockets while continuing to work with the company to drive meaningful change," Joan Robinson-Berry, Boeing vice president and general manager, South Carolina, said in a statement. South Carolina is a right-to-work state where employees can't be forced to join a union or pay dues even when covered by a union contract. In April 2015, it had the second-lowest union membership in the United States. Boeing's workforce at its main commercial aircraft factories in Washington state is largely unionized. The South Carolina plant, which opened in 2011, makes 787 Dreamliners and is the only Boeing jetliner assembly line outside of Washington state. It is the sole producer of the 787-10, Boeing's largest Dreamliner. The first 787-10 is currently being assembled in South Carolina. It is due for its first flight this year, and the first customer delivery is expected in 2018.

Malaysia has said it would pay a reward to any private company that found the fuselage of missing Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370, days after a three-year hunt was suspended. Key points: All three countries ended the search for MH370 on Tuesday Malaysia's Deputy Transport Minister has suggested offering a monetary reward for private companies interested in finding the jet Malaysia holds ultimate responsibility for the search due to the company registration of Malaysia Airlines Australia, Malaysia and China ended the search for the aircraft on Tuesday, leaving one of the world's greatest aviation mysteries unanswered. The Boeing 777 jet disappeared in March 2014, en route to Beijing from the Malaysian capital of Kuala Lumpur with 239 people on board. Malaysian Deputy Transport Minister Abdul Aziz Kaprawi said the Government was open to credible private companies searching for it, and would reward any that found its fuselage. "All costs must be borne by them. We will only reward them if they are successful," Mr Abdul Aziz said. He said the size of the reward had not been decided. Any company intending to search should contact the government, and a decision would then be made on the reward, he said. The search of a 120,000 square kilometre area of the Indian Ocean cost about $200 million. But the three countries involved were reluctant to keep looking without new evidence about the plane's final resting place. Flight MH370 lost contact over the Gulf of Thailand in the early hours of March 8, 2014. Subsequent analysis of radar and satellite contacts suggested someone on board may have deliberately switched off the plane's transponder before diverting it thousands of kilometres out over the Indian Ocean. Since the crash, there have been competing theories over whether the plane was hijacked and whether it was under the control of anyone when it finally ran out of fuel. Searching for the sake of relatives Photo: Wang Yulian, whose daughter was among the passengers onboard MH370 is comforted by relatives. (Reuters: Damir Sagolj) The end of the underwater search drew swift and angry reactions from relatives of those on board, who have repeatedly called for the hunt to be expanded. "We know the next-of-kin are not happy when we suspended the search," Mr Abdul Aziz said. "We can't proceed until there is new evidence, but if there are credible companies that want to take on the search, then why not?" he said. The only confirmed traces of the plane have been three pieces of debris found washed up on the island country Mauritius, the French island Reunion and an island off Tanzania. As many as 30 other pieces of wreckage found there and on beaches in Mozambique, Tanzania and South Africa are suspected to have come from the plane. On Wednesday, Australia said it was not ruling out a future underwater search. Video: Brother of MH370 victim not surprised search has ended (ABC News) Malaysia holds ultimate responsibility for the search given Malaysia Airlines is registered there. The aircraft is thought to have crashed west of Australia, placing it in its maritime zone of responsibility. Most of the passengers were from China. MH370's disappearance echoes the 2009 loss in the Atlantic Ocean of an Air France jet, a two-year search for which exhausted the resources of the French BEA accident agency. Planemaker Airbus and Air France agreed to participate in funding the final two stages of the search, which ran into about a third of the total underwater search costs of 80 million euros ($113 million). Mr Abdul Aziz said the MH370 search costs had been borne by the three countries while the aircraft-maker, Boeing, had not committed anything. "There's been no funding from Boeing," he said. An Australian official said the ATSB had not asked Boeing to provide funds, only technical help. Boeing said in a statement it provided technical expertise and assistance, principally as advisers to government investigative authorities. "In addition, at the direction and under the supervision of investigating authorities, Boeing provides exemplar hardware, testing analysis and laboratory services," the company said.

Well, you can be lucky. Or you can take matters into your own hands. Planes have always crashed. The first fatal accident occurred in 1908, just five years after the Wright brothers completed the earliest controlled, sustained and heavier-than-air flight. The pilot of the plane involved in the crash, in which one passenger died? Orville Wright himself. But there are crashes and crashes. Some, patently, cannot be survived. Others, however – the vast majority, in fact – can be. A US government study found there were 568 plane crashes in the US between 1993 and 2000, involving a total of 53,487 passengers and crew. Of these, 51,207 – or over 90 per cent survived. Even on the 26 crashes deemed the worst, the study found that more than half the passengers and crew survived. Contrary to popular statistical myth, however, air travel is not the safest form of transport – rail travel is safer in terms of accidents per journey and accidents per hour travelled (air travel wins only in accidents per mile travelled). But what is true, contrary to expectation, as the study reveals, is the survivability of most crashes. More to the point, the study found that a third of those who died – smoke and fire accounted for most deaths – would almost certainly have survived if they'd taken certain precautions. Which is the safest mode of transport? So what are these precautions? Well, as you'd imagine, it's an imprecise science, heavy with claim and counter-claim, with some precautions rendered useless in certain crashes. But there are areas on which all agree. Here is a checklist that might just save your life. Have a plan This is the key. Time and again, having a notion of what you are going to do in the event of a crash or forced landing has been found to be fundamental to survival. First, really do listen to the safety announcement and read the safety card, and if you don't, then at the very least know exactly where to find the nearest exits. Actually count the number of rows from your seat to exits in front and behind you – the chances are you might be trying to find your way to an exit in pitch dark and/or thick smoke. Bear in mind that – unfortunately – you may have several minutes' warning before impact, so use the time to go through any plan again. Read the instructions and have a plan Credit: ALAMY The safest seats Although some claim that seats over the wing of an aircraft are best (because the plane is “strongest” there), popular opinion has it that, in the event of a plane crash, the rear of an aircraft is the safest place to be. This theory is supported by several studies and a 2013 Channel 4 documentary. The producers of the show, The Crash, arranged for a Boeing 727 carrying cameras, sensors and crash test dummies with breakable “bones” to be deliberately crashed into the Sonoran Desert in Mexico. After hitting the ground, the front of the plane and the first 11 rows of seats – usually reserved for first-class, business-class or premium-economy passengers – were ripped off. A force of 12G was recorded in this section of the aircraft. Further back, the force fell to around 6G. Experts concluded that none of the plane’s first-class passengers would have survived, but 78 per cent of the other passengers would have, with the chance of survival increasing the closer they were to the rear of the aircraft.  Though an analysis of a single crash is hardly decisive, the findings support a study by Popular Mechanics, carried out in 2007. The magazine analysed all crashes after 1971 and found that rear seats (behind the wing’s trailing edge) were safest, with survival rates of 69 per cent as opposed to 56 per cent over the wing and 49 per cent at the front. Safest years in aviation history | Deaths per total number of passengers flown The world’s two biggest aircraft manufacturers, however, insist that no conclusive evidence is available. “One seat is as safe as another,” said a spokesman for Boeing. “Especially if you stay buckled up.” That is an important point. The Channel 4 study in Mexico also saw three dummies placed in the same row, but in different positions: one in the brace position and wearing a seatbelt, one buckled up but sat normally, and one sat normally minus the belt. The unfastened traveller would have been the only one to perish, experts claimed. This evacuation issue is also key. As outlined above, the majority of plane crashes are survivable. So surely a seat close to an exit would be safest? This theory is supported by a University of Greenwich study, commissioned by the CAA. Researchers checked the accounts of 2,000 survivors in 105 accidents around the world. Those sat more than six rows from an exit were found to be far less likely to survive, though the difference between window and aisle seat was “marginal”. Manufacturers claims all seats are equally safe - but studies suggest otherwise Credit: Kurganov Aleksandr +79033161409/Aleksandr Kurganov Brace Like the safest seats, this is a contentious area. Internet conspiracy theorists claim the recommended brace positions (which themselves have varied over the years) are those guaranteed to break your neck and back most successfully – a deliberate ploy, they claim, to make your death as quick and painless as possible and reduce insurance costs. Others – less ludicrously – point out that one of the two recommended brace positions is impossible for anyone in an economy seat, where the space in front of you is simply insufficient to adopt the suggested position. It's worth noting that some think the recommended brace positions don't make much sense, and that you should sit up straight and push against the seat in front of you. In any event, you are trying to do three basic things by bracing. Get your torso as low as possible to reduce the jackknife effect at impact; stop yourself from flying forward and hitting the seat or other parts of the aircraft interior; and preventing injury to your legs and ankles that will hinder your escape from the aircraft. Ignore the conspiracy theorists and brace Credit: ALAMY Protection That last point is pertinent: after the M1 Kegworth crash of 1989 (when 79 of the 126 people on board survived), many victims and survivors were found to have legs broken below the knee, the result of their legs flying into, or being forced against the seat structure in front of them. Therefore hold your legs and/or place feet flat on the floor, preferably farther back than your knees, and place hand luggage under the seat in front of you to act as a cushion or check. If you can, add additional protection for your head – a pillow, say. Be sure that you have removed any dentures, pencils or other sharp objects from around your person. Also be sure to hold the brace position until the plane has come to a standstill – often there will be additional impacts after the initial one. The worlds safest - and least safe - airlines revealed Seat belts One of the strangest findings of research into crashes and passenger behaviour is that over and over again people struggled with what you'd imagine would be the easiest of tasks – undoing their seat belts. The reason is that in times of stress people revert to learned, normal behaviour and when it comes to seat belts normal and instinctive means a car seat belt. Following a crash, investigators found that many people scrabbled around to find the push-button release on their belts, as this is the release with which they were most familiar. Aircraft seat belts unbuckle. As for the belt itself, pull it as tight as possible. For every inch of slack you are increasing the potential g-forces to which you'll be subjected. Watch | How to get a free airline upgrade 01:00 Negative panic After a crash, speed is of the essence, as is calm. But a frequent stress reaction is what is known as “negative panic”, whereby people remain seated and immobile, as if in a trance, stunned by events. The same can apply to aircraft crew, who, despite their rigorous training, may also be stunned and fail to react. One of the keys to survival can be to listen to, and follow crews' instructions, but if they or your immediate neighbours appear to be in a trance, then you have to make your own moves and decisions. In a similar vein, stunned passengers were often found to have remained seated waiting for instructions that, for whatever reason, didn't come. Move. Smoke inhalation Fire is a main cause of death in most survivable crashes, but smoke is worse. Even a few breaths that draw in smoke can result in loss of consciousness. If possible wet a handkerchief, or other piece of material – the seat back headrest, for example – to cover your nose and mouth. If no water is available, use urine. This is a matter of life and death – it's no time to be fastidious. The confessions of an air hostess Low to the ground In a smoke-filled plane, some sources suggest you keep low to the floor as there's likely to be less smoke at floor level. Wrong. The chances are you'll simply be trampled, crushed or suffocated under luggage, falling bodies and the rush of other passengers. Keep your head down, mouth and nose covered, but stay on two feet. Climb over seat backs if gangways are blocked. At a glance | 10 deadliest years in aviation history Hands-free People do the most remarkable things after crashes, one of the strangest of which is trying to retrieve some, or all of their possessions. For goodness' sake – leave them. You don't have time, the possessions will slow you (and others) down, and you will need both hands free, whether it's to remove obstacles, hold a pad over your nose and mouth or fight off the flailing fists of others. This said, don't push (you won't get through any faster) or lash out yourself – you'll slow everything and everyone down and invite retaliation: and in a stressful fight-and-flight situation such as a crash, people find extraordinary strength – you could be knocked out or otherwise injured. Move fast The "golden period" for escape lasts only up to about two minutes. Listen to flight attendants, get to an exit fast, check quickly that it is viable, inside and out, then get out and move as far from the plane as fast as possible. And whether you stop to help others? Well, that is up to you, and to the reserves of courage and fellow feeling you may or may not have. Who knows what we will do in extremis?

By India Ashok January 20, 2017 10:50 GMT The device also contained sensitive corporate data, which, if accessed by a hacker, could have led to a full scale breach of the firm’s networksReuters A Silicon Valley-based translation and interpreter firm has reportedly confirmed a massive data leak, which could potentially have led to hackers stealing the firm's financial and sensitive corporate data and more. The California-headquartered Interpreters Unlimited, also known as IU Group, provides services to tech giants such as Google, Boeing and the US Postal Service. Security researchers at MacKeeper uncovered an unprotected internet-connected backup drive, which belonged to the IU Group's IT manager. The backup drive's lack of password protection allowed anyone to access and download the device's contents. The security gaffe was caused due to a drive misconfiguration, which in turn allowed the device to seamlessly stream data onto the internet. According to a report by ZDNet, the leaked files contained personal documents on the IU Group's IT manager, including permanent residency documents, passports, social security data and tax records. The device also contained sensitive corporate data, which, if accessed by a hacker, could have led to a full scale breach of the firm's networks. The leaked files included personal and sensitive data of clients, staff and new hires, including names, phone numbers, addresses and social security numbers. MacKeeper researchers noted that the leaked data "even had the amount of money translators earned with the company the previous year". "This one document provides enough information that would allow criminals to file fake tax returns, get loans, or other forms of fraud," the researchers said. It is also estimated that around 4,500 of the firm's staff and freelancers may have been affected by the incident. IU Group's president Sayed Ali confirmed that the drive was online and freely accessible for "four to six months", adding that it has now been removed. Ali said the firm believes this to be an isolated incident, but that it is "not taking the matter lightly". The firm is slated to bring in an independent security expert to investigate the matter. Meanwhile, the device and its contents allegedly appeared on Shodan, a popular search engine for internet-connected open and insecure databases. This indicates that the data may likely have been exposed to malicious entities. It still remains unknown if the data has been accessed or abused by hackers.

Trump will take the oath of office around noon. By Alanna Petroff LONDON (CNNMoney) -- 1. Inauguration day: Donald Trump is set to be sworn in as the 45th president of the United States on Friday. Trump will take the oath of office around noon. Since his election, he has shown an uncanny ability to move markets. Investors have pushed U.S. and global stock markets higher in response to his pro-business rhetoric. The Dow Jones industrial average has surged 7.6% since the election and even traded near 20,000 points before easing back down. The S&P 500 jumped 5.8% while the Nasdaq added 6.7% over the same period. But the Republican has also introduced a heavy dose of uncertainty to markets. Trump has made a habit of targeting and calling out specific companies on Twitter. He's criticized Boeing, Lockheed Martin, United Technologies, GM and Ford -- as well as foreign car companies Toyota and BMW. He has also threatened tariffs on companies building their products in Mexico instead of the U.S. and slammed China's trade policies. 2. Global market overview: U.S. stock markets hit record highs earlier this year and they're not far from those levels right now. But U.S. stock futures suggest investors want more detail from Trump before they're ready to push shares even higher. The major indexes are holding steady right now. "Investors [will be] hoping that his speech comprehensively outlines his policy plans for the next four years in a scripted rather than lively off-the-cuff affair," said Mike van Dulken, a market analyst at Accendo Markets. European markets are mostly edging up in early trading, though the gains are modest. Asian markets ended the day with mixed results. 3. Earnings: A number of blue-chip companies are reporting quarterly results this morning, including General Electric and Procter & Gamble. 4. Drug wars -- Bristol-Myers Squibb vs Merck: Shares in Bristol-Myers Squibb are falling by about 5% premarket after the firm announced it wouldn't pursue "an accelerated regulatory pathway" for a lung cancer treatment it had been developing. This has helped shares in competitor Merck pop by about 5% premarket. The company announced earlier this month that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration had begun reviewing a license for its lung cancer treatment, Keytruda. It's going through the fast track approval process. 5. Coming this week: Friday - Inauguration day for President-elect Donald Trump TM & © 2017 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

(AFP) Malaysia said on Thursday it would pay a reward to any private company that found the fuselage of missing Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370, days after a fruitless, three-year hunt was suspended. Australia, Malaysia and China ended the search for the aircraft on Tuesday, leaving one of the world's greatest aviation mysteries unanswered. The Boeing 777 jet disappeared in March 2014, en route to Beijing from the Malaysian capital of Kuala Lumpur, with 239 people on board. Malaysian Deputy Transport Minister Abdul Aziz Kaprawi said the government was open to credible private companies searching for it, and would reward any that found its fuselage. "All costs must be borne by them. We will only reward them if they are successful," Abdul Aziz told Reuters. He said the size of the reward had not been decided. Any company intending to search should contact the government, and a decision would then be made on the reward, he said. The search of a 120,000 sq km area of the Indian Ocean cost about A$200 million ($150 million). But the three countries involved were reluctant to keep looking without new evidence about the plane's final resting place. Flight MH370 lost contact over the Gulf of Thailand in the early hours of March 8, 2014. Subsequent analysis of radar and satellite contacts suggested someone on board may have deliberately switched off the plane's transponder before diverting it thousands of kilometres out over the Indian Ocean. Since the crash, there have been competing theories over whether the plane was hijacked and whether it was under the control of anyone when it finally ran out of fuel. 'NOT HAPPY' The end of the underwater search drew swift and angry reactions from relatives of those on board, who have repeatedly called for the hunt to be expanded. "We know the next-of-kin are not happy when we suspended the search," said Abdul Aziz. "We can't proceed until there is new evidence, but if there are credible companies that want to take on the search, then why not?" he said. The only confirmed traces of the plane have been three pieces of debris found washed up on the island country Mauritius, the French island Reunion and an island off Tanzania. As many as 30 other pieces of wreckage found there and on beaches in Mozambique, Tanzania and South Africa are suspected to have come from the plane. On Wednesday, Australia said it was not ruling out a future underwater search. Malaysia holds ultimate responsibility for the search given Malaysia Airlines is registered there. The aircraft is thought to have crashed west of Australia, placing it in its maritime zone of responsibility. Most of the passengers were from China. Abdul Aziz said the search costs had been borne by the three countries while the aircraft-maker, Boeing, had not committed anything. "There's been no funding from Boeing," he said. Boeing said in a statement it provided technical expertise and assistance, principally as advisers to government investigative authorities. "In addition, at the direction and under the supervision of investigating authorities, Boeing provides exemplar hardware, testing analysis and laboratory services," the company said.

By Tanya Jefferies for Thisismoney.co.uk Published: 03:46 EST, 20 January 2017 | Updated: 08:32 EST, 21 January 2017 e-mail 7 shares 3 View comments Nerves are setting in about what new US president Donald Trump will do in office after a surge of optimism initially lifted markets around the world in response to his election. Early goodwill created the so-called 'Trump Trade', as investors hope he will help boost American companies and the economy - the biggest in the world - with a programme of infrastructure spending, tax cuts and business deregulation. The Dow Jones almost touched 20,000 for the first time, reaching a tantalising 19,999.63 before falling back in recent weeks. Donald Trump: Celebrated as a dealmaking magnate, but what will he do as president? US markets have come off recent  highs as investors mull potential downsides of the Trump presidency - a trade war with China, international instability, and a stream of unpredictable tweets knocking the share prices of one corporate giant after another, including General Motors and Lockheed Martin among others. RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Could the FTSE 100 fall 40%? Biggest bull run in history... The shares to watch in 2017: From  an unloved clothing... Investing Show: Where to invest for income and how to spot... 'US companies face more headwinds than any others': Leading... Share this article Share UK investors, who have enjoyed a great run of returns from buoyant US stocks in recent years, tend to be more concerned about the long-term prospects for American corporate success than day-to-day political machinations. However, warnings were being sounded long before Trump became a presidential candidate that US shares were already at extremely expensive levels and a correction or a crash was overdue.  For now, as Trump is inaugurated as the 45th US president, he is still being lauded as the dealmaking business magnate who understands the corporate world and how best to realise its potential. Yet he is, at the same time, a volatile political novice, and US stocks are currently trading at historical highs that make them vulnerable to shocks. Below, we round up views on the US investment outlook as the Trump presidential era begins. What has happened to markets since the Trump victory? 'Major stock markets have rallied as much as 12 per cent since Trump was elected as president,' says Keith Wade, chief economist at Schroders. 'Investors expect his policies to reinvigorate the US economy, and perhaps for this effect to spread out further. 'The US market’s gain is dwarfed by those in Europe, with the Eurostoxx 50 up 8.7 per cent, and Japan, with the Nikkei 225 14.1 per cent higher. The figures are calculated in local currencies (see below). Trump trade: Major stock markets have soared since the US election in November (Source: Schroders) He went on: 'The US and the Japan have high CAPE valuations with the US above the long-term average. For some backers of these markets, these valuations are justified by the prospects of the companies (see below and read more here about CAPE, a measure of whether markets are cheap or expensive).  Number crunching: How stock markets compare now with their 10-year averages. Schroders explains: 'The P/E (price-to-earnings) ratio compares a company’s share price and its earnings over the past 12 months. The CAPE (cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings) ratio does the same but averages the profits over 10 years to smooth distortions created by the business cycle. 'The UK market is in line with its long-run average while Europe is slightly higher. Both markets are significantly cheaper than stock markets in US and Japan. 'Investors have fully bought into Trump’s promise to "make America great again": activity will be stronger and trade deals more favourable to the US. Inflation and interest rates are heading higher. 'At this stage the reflation trade (buying assets that will benefit from higher inflation) has strong momentum as investors jump on the Trump band wagon. However, the impact of the new president’s fiscal policies will not be felt until end-2017 and into 2018. There are some tricky waters to be navigated before they take effect. 'At present markets do not seem to be anticipating problems either in terms of delays by Congress, or in boosting growth significantly. Such optimism is likely to be questioned: prepare for a reappraisal of the Trump trade.'  Market watch: Investing experts have warned for years that US stocks are expensive (Source: Yahoo!Finance) What could happen to markets after Trump enters the White House? 'Trump has been vocal about his plans for the economy in the run up to his inauguration, and US financial markets have basked in the pro-business change in policy that is expected once the new President takes office.' says Kathleen Brooks, research director at City Index Direct. 'However, the focus post the inauguration will be how fast policies can be implemented, and whether Trump can deliver on all of his promises. There are already some doubts starting to creep in, and in recent weeks US stock markets have pushed the pause button and traded sideways. 'There is a lot of bullish expectations around Trump’s policies, however, there are also some major road-blocks to his vision to Make America Great Again.' 'The biggest problem with "Trumpenomics" is that fiscal expansion coupled with protectionism tend to boost growth and employment when the unemployment level is high. New partner in the White House: Prime Minister Theresa May is expected to meet Donald Trump soon 'However, the US is experiencing a very high level of employment at the moment, so these policies could actually hinder Trump’s hopes of doubling the growth rate during his term in office. 'For example, a large fiscal stimulus programme when employment levels are high does not boost production, but instead tends to increase inflation pressures. Likewise, any protectionist policies like increased tariffs on certain imports could also push up price pressures as household purchasing power remains strong. 'Trump’s economic policies actually increase the risk of higher interest rates over the next four years, as the Federal Reserve tries to neutralise looser fiscal policy with tighter monetary policy. Thus, Trumpenomics could lead to a cyclical downturn in the medium term. 'There are two main risk factors from Trump’s Presidency, in our view. The first is a sell-off in the short-term once Trump moves into the White House. Much of the "good" news for financial markets has already been priced in since November, thus, risk could get sold-off in a traditional buy the rumour, sell the fact trade. 'A larger concern for traders could be the potential for increased levels of financial market volatility under Trump, as the market waits to see if and when his policies are enacted. 'Other risks for higher levels of volatility going forward include the President continuing to undermine certain corporations via Tweet. Boeing, healthcare and defence companies have all come under criticism from Trump in 140 characters. The US dollar also came under pressure recently, after Trump commented on the negative impact of a strong dollar. 'Overall, the markets have been willing to give Trump the benefit of the doubt in the last two and a half months. Now that reality hits, profit-taking could be the order of the day.' New friend? Republicans are traditionally hostile to Russia, but Trump is seeking a better relationship with the country's current leader Vladimir Putin How do markets usually fare when Republicans are in power? 'Global share prices have been on a tear since Donald Trump’s victory in last November’s US election, buoyed by hopes that his plans to cut taxes, push for deregulation and increase infrastructure spending will fuel growth and inflation, replicating what many see as a market-friendly package of reforms to match that launched by Ronald Reagan after his 1980 triumph over Jimmy Carter,' says Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell. 'However, investors might like to consider that the Dow Jones Industrials initially ran up strongly on the news of Reagan’s November 1980 victory only to completely lose momentum after his inauguration on 20 January 1981, in a classic case of “buy on the rumour, sell on the fact”. 'Last Wednesday’s press conference ultimately failed to provide any firm details on how Trump intends to push through his planned programme (or how he intends to fund it) so the market will start looking for firm proposals pretty quickly once he starts work in earnest on Monday 23 January. 'Failure to deliver concrete proposals could spread further doubt, eroding the support for stocks and the dollar and giving bonds a fresh boost. A poor year for US stocks would be oddly in keeping with the historic trend evidenced by the first terms of Republican Presidents since the Second World War. 'The Dow Jones has declined on eight of nine occasions during the first year of a Republican Presidency and it has fallen on all four occasions when a Republican has taken the reigns from a Democrat. 'The average first-year drop under post-war Republicans of 1.2 per cent compares to an average 13.2 per cent gain under Democrats.' Source: Thomson Reuters Datastream and AJ Bell What's the investment outlook and which US funds could do well? 'This Friday sees the inauguration of maverick property mogul and reality TV personality Donald Trump as the 45th President of the United States of America who will also become the de facto Leader of the Free World,' says Jason Hollands, managing director of Tilney Bestinvest. 'Trump is without doubt the most controversial and unconventional person to enter the White House in living memory, who powered to success on a tide of resentment against the status quo under the campaign promise to “Make America Great Again”. 'Trump’s rise to power has seen the financial markets flip rapidly from fear over what his volatile personality and protectionist instincts could mean, to bullishness over the potential impact on the US economy from a proposed cocktail of aggressive tax cuts, a shock and awe infrastructure investment programme and reigning back on elements of banking regulations introduced after the credit crisis. 'Notably, purchases of US equity funds proved more popular with UK retail investors, with net inflows into US equities funds of £168million in November, a sharp reversal from the previous month when the sector saw an outflow of £224million. 'Since Trump was named President Elect in November the S&P 500 Index of leading US company shares has surged 6 per cent, with UK based investors in US equity funds also benefiting from a strengthening of the dollar against the pound. Outgoing president: Barack Obama is moving out of the White House to a new home in Washington with his family 'While the precise details of which Trump campaign promises will end up being fully enacted remain a subject for debate, there is little doubt that the US policy environment is changing dramatically. 'For investors who have already enjoyed a multi-year run just being in the US market, this radically changing policy landscape and what it implies for inflation, supply chains, global trade and corporate taxes opens up the prospect of significant differences between the potential winners and losers from these seismic shifts in policy. 'This, laced with prospect of Twitter-led diplomacy creates the prospect for high levels of future volatility as well much greater dispersion in returns between stocks and sectors. 'In theory this should create a much more fertile investment landscape for those active fund managers prepared to take a much more selective approach, who in recent years have steadily been regarded as almost redundant when it comes to investing in US equities in favour of low cost index trackers.' Hollands highlights four investment fund ideas as the Trump presidency begins. Dodge & Cox Worldwide US Equity: 'This fund invests in a portfolio of US companies and is managed from San Francisco with a team approach and with a strong value style bias which could stand it in good stead when concerns remain about the premium valuation of US equities,' he says. 'The fund currently has a sizeable weighting of 29 per cent in financials, almost twice the exposure of the S&P 500 Index with prominent holdings in Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Capital One, Charles Schwab and Goldman Sachs.'  T Rowe Price US Smaller Companies Equity: 'If you buy into the Trump narrative and believe he will succeed in ratcheting up domestic growth, then funds focused on smaller companies, which are typically more domestic in nature, could benefit the most,' says Hollands. 'This fund, managed from Baltimore, is highly diversified with 192 positions and has been adding exposure to gas utilities, energy exploration and regional banks.'  Trade war? Trump has warned President Xi Jinping that he is going to declare China a 'currency manipulator' Old Mutual North American: 'This fund is managed using a systematic investment approach that weights the potential universe of stocks based on the attractiveness of their valuations, the strength of their growth characteristics, market momentum, analyst sentiment and management attributes,' says Hollands. 'This disciplined approach is used to construct a portfolio of around 200 holdings, which currently has 22 per cent exposure to IT and 16 per cent to financials as major themes.'  PowerShares FTSE RAFI US 1000 ETF: 'Investors who just can't bring themselves to give active US managers a second chance might instead consider this exchange traded fund over a traditional S&P 500 tracker,' says Hollands. 'It invests in a basket of the 1,000 largest US companies but instead of weighting them on market-capitalisation, stocks are weighted based on a basket of four fundamental factors: book value, cash flow, sales and dividends and this is rebased annually. 'This approach leads the portfolio to be weighted to more robust companies and with a tilt towards more reasonably valued businesses.'  Could Trump scrap the 'strong dollar' policy? 'Risk events keep on coming this year but the market knows to rely on President-Elect Donald Trump to stoke the fires,' says Jamie Dutta, senior market analyst at Faraday Research. 'Notably in this, his inauguration week, Mr Trump turned his attention to foreign exchange markets and specifically the "overvaluation" of the dollar. 'In his first major foray in to this area, Mr Trump stated in an interview that "our currency is too strong, and it’s killing us". 'Does this typically brazen approach signify the beginning of the end for "strong dollar" policy? Many commentators are calling Mr Trump’s remarks random, and suggesting that we should not take them literally. Dollar vs pound: Greenback has leapt since the Brexit vote last June (Source: Yahoo!Finance) 'However, they are harder to disregard when comments like this are becoming more frequent. Indeed, in this instance, one of his key advisers backed up his comments soon after. 'So, from Twitter diplomacy to verbal intervention in currencies, we have to get used to an increasingly volatile state of current affairs. 'If there is a contravention of decades of US economic policy, then we will see dollar bulls abandoning the Trump bump, and the abrupt end of the greenback’s 14-year uptrend. 'During his campaign, Mr Trump said many things which he has since reneged on. He promised on day one of his presidency that he would declare China a currency manipulator. If this happens, then from that point on, we may be able to determine one of Mr Trump’s key planks of his economic policy.'  Dollar vs euro: Greenback has made gains against the single currency since the US election (Source: Yahoo!Finance) Share or comment on this article e-mail 7 shares Comments (3) Share what you think Newest Oldest Best rated Worst rated  View all The comments below have not been moderated.  View all The views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.

The Boeing 777 jet disappeared in March 2014, en route to Beijing from the Malaysian capital of Kuala Lumpur, with 239 people on board. Malaysian Deputy Transport Minister Abdul Aziz Kaprawi said the government was open to credible private companies searching for it, and would reward any that found its fuselage. "All costs must be borne by them. We will only reward them if they are successful," Abdul Aziz told Reuters. He said the size of the reward had not been decided. Any company intending to search should contact the government, and a decision would then be made on the reward, he said. The search of a 120,000-sq-km (46,000-sq-mile) area of the Indian Ocean cost about A$200 million ($150 million). But the three countries involved were reluctant to keep looking without new evidence about the plane's final resting place. Flight MH370 lost contact over the Gulf of Thailand in the early hours of March 8, 2014. Subsequent analysis of radar and satellite contacts suggested someone on board may have deliberately switched off the plane's transponder before diverting it thousands of kilometres out over the Indian Ocean. Since the crash, there have been competing theories over whether the plane was hijacked and whether it was under the control of anyone when it finally ran out of fuel. 'NOT HAPPY' The end of the underwater search drew swift and angry reactions from relatives of those on board, who have repeatedly called for the hunt to be expanded. "We know the next-of-kin are not happy when we suspended the search," said Abdul Aziz. "We can't proceed until there is new evidence, but if there are credible companies that want to take on the search, then why not?" he said. The only confirmed traces of the plane have been three pieces of debris found washed up on the island country Mauritius, the French island Reunion and an island off Tanzania. As many as 30 other pieces of wreckage found there and on beaches in Mozambique, Tanzania and South Africa are suspected to have come from the plane. On Wednesday, Australia said it was not ruling out a future underwater search. Malaysia holds ultimate responsibility for the search given Malaysia Airlines is registered there. The aircraft is thought to have crashed west of Australia, placing it in its maritime zone of responsibility. Most of the passengers were from China. MH370's disappearance echoes the 2009 loss in the Atlantic Ocean of an Air France jet, a two-year search for which exhausted the resources of the French BEA accident agency. Planemaker Airbus and Air France agreed to participate in funding the final two stages of the search, which ran into about a third of the total underwater search costs of 80 million euros. Abdul Aziz said the MH370 search costs had been borne by the three countries, while the aircraft-maker, Boeing, had not committed anything. "There's been no funding from Boeing," he said. An Australian official said the ATSB had not asked Boeing to provide funds, only technical help. Boeing said in a statement it provided technical expertise and assistance, principally as advisers to government investigative authorities. "In addition, at the direction and under the supervision of investigating authorities, Boeing provides exemplar hardware, testing analysis and laboratory services," the company said.

No sooner does he slam a fist on his desk, demanding that companies add American jobs, than they issue press releases promising to oblige. Wal-Mart will add 10,000 jobs, it announced earlier this week. General Motors plans to invest $1 billion and add 7,000 U.S. jobs, it said. Bayer AG, the German pharmaceutical giant, promised to invest $8 billion in America, and add 3,000 jobs. And soon. Trump thinks it's all terrific! "Thank you to General Motors and Walmart for starting the big jobs push back into the U.S.!" he tweeted on Jan. 17. VIDEOS TOP JOBS When NBC pointed out that these jobs had nothing to do with Trump's exhortations, he quickly shot back the next day: "to the U.S., but had nothing to do with TRUMP, is more FAKE NEWS. Ask top CEO's of those companies for real facts. Came back because of me!" He has also met with a number of other top executives, including Randall Stephenson, the chief executive of AT&T, and Dennis Muilenburg, Boeing's CEO. In both cases, the two CEOs came across as supplicants who had arrived at Trump Tower to kiss the ring of the new king. Which, of course, is exactly what Trump wanted. But upon closer inspection, you have to wonder whether it's Trump who is gaming the companies, or the companies that are gaming the incoming president. It's not just that those 10,000 new Wal-Mart jobs were always part of the company's plan for 2017 -- the new employees will mainly staff new stores -- it's also the kind of jobs they represent. Although Wal-Mart has become a little less stingy in recent years, its entry-level wage is still only around $10 an hour. Meanwhile, as Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Jennifer Bartashus has noted, Wal-Mart is "cutting costs by eliminating more non-customer-facing jobs." In other words, Wal-Mart is cutting the good jobs while expanding the bad jobs. This is not exactly a strategy to Make America Great Again. The General Motors announcement was even more of a scam. Days before the GM news, Trump had complained the Chevy Cruze was built in Mexico-and he threatened to impose a border tax. Indeed, he wants all the car companies to reduce their Mexico operations and start bringing those jobs back to the U.S. But it's never going to happen, for two reasons. First, most American sedans can't be made profitably in U.S. factories; the margins are too small. Second, Mexico has made itself an attractive place to make cars, with worker training programs, incentives for manufacturers and the like. The result is that Mexico is becoming to auto manufacturing what China is to tech manufacturing. By making its announcement about 7,000 jobs, GM was able to distract the president-elect from the hard facts about building cars in Mexico. The announcement had no specifics, but never mind. Trump got to pat GM on the back and declare victory. And the Mexico issue went away -- at least for now. Bayer? It wants to take over Monsanto, and it will need regulatory approval from the new administration. So the CEOs of both companies met with Trump and emerged from the meeting promising additional jobs for Monsanto as well as billions in new investments. Naturally, the Trump team took credit for the new job promise. Hey, wait a minute. What are these two company executives doing lobbying the incoming president about a merger? Isn't the Justice Department supposed to have the final say on whether a merger can go through or not, based its reading of the nation's antitrust laws? And isn't the president supposed to defer to the antitrust experts in his administration? Of course he is. The last president who got directly involved in helping a company avoid antitrust problems was Richard Nixon. The company was ITT. It didn't work out so well. It's possible, I suppose, that Trump knows this is something presidents are supposed to leave to the Justice Department, and he just doesn't care. But it's just as likely that he doesn't know any better, and that the companies are taking advantage of his naivete -- and his ego -- to make what amounts to an ex-parte appeal for their deal. Indeed, another CEO who visited Trump to plead for a merger was AT&T's Stephenson. AT&T wants to buy Time Warner -- a deal that Trump had vowed to block on the campaign trail, claiming it would bring about a "concentration of power." After the meeting? In an interview with Mike Allen and Jim Vandehei of the new online news site Axios, Trump backed away. "I haven't seen any of the facts, yet," he said. » Next page...

Before today, the AWS consisted of Arrow-2 interceptors, and has now added for the first time the Arrow-3 operational interceptor (made by Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI)/MLM). The Arrow-3 interceptor is a world-class missile that, together with the Arrow-2, expands the defense envelope provided to the State of Israel. The Arrow-3 interceptor capabilities enable longer range, higher altitude (exo-atmospheric) and more precise ballistic missile engagements. The combined interception capabilities of the Arrow-2 and Arrow-3 will significantly reduce the possibilities of ballistic missiles impacting the State of Israel. This morning in a formal ceremony, the Israel Missile Defense Organization (IMDO), a division of the Israeli Ministry of Defense, transferred the operational Arrow-3 interceptors to the Israeli Air Force (IAF) Aerial Defense Array. The Arrow-3 development program, one of the joint programs between Israel and the United States, was exceptionally co-managed by the U.S. Missile Defense Agency and IMDO. The U.S. contribution to the program is a key reason Israel has achieved this remarkable accomplishment. Additionally, Boeing (U.S.), the major subcontractor to IAI/ MLM, played a prominent role in the development and production of the components for the innovative Arrow-3 interceptor. During the integration process of the new interceptor, the weapons system components were fully upgraded. These substantial improvements are the results of the finest minds in the defense industry, who diligently worked day and night to achieve this milestone. The Battle Management Center (made by Elbit) has new significant capabilities as well as the radar detection array (made by IAI/ ELTA), which improved its ability to take on the increasingly growing threat. As the threats continue to grow and new emerging threats surface, IMOD, IMDO and the U.S. are dedicated to the continued development and enhancement of the Israeli Ballistic Missile Defense elements and systems to provide the appropriate defense solutions. Undeniably, the Arrow Weapon System’s unique and expanding capabilities place Israel among the most advanced countries in the World in the ability to defense against ballistic missile threats. Boaz Levi, IAI’s Vice President and General Manager of the Systems, Missiles & Space Group: “Arrow-3 is the result of many years of development efforts, based on a solution designed by IAI which have today come to fruition. This is a milestone for the Israel’s Defence Establishment, and for Israel’s defense industries. The Israel Air Force now has an additional level of air defense allowing missile interception at very high altitudes in space, and together with the Arrow-2 system, provides the best possible solution for defense against ballistic missiles. Many industries participated in the system development, with responsibility for major building blocks in the program, among them ELTA an IAI subsidiary, Rafael Advanced Systems, Israel Military Industries and Elisra. On a personal note, Levi added that “handing over the system today to the Air Force, for me, closes a circle, and fulfills a dream, as someone who both accompanied and led the development and design of the system for many years.” TAGS arrow 3 israel missile defense missiles Previous articleRussia, Turkey stage first joint air strikes against IS in Syria Next articleGermany Raises Defense Spending as it Demands Clear Agenda from US IsraeliMoD RELATED ARTICLESMORE FROM AUTHOR Missiles & Bombs News Israel and US Complete David’s Sling Weapon System Intercept Test Series Missiles & Bombs News Russia’s Defense Ministry Considering Iskander Missile System Upgrade Air Force & Aerospace News Air-Launched Cruise Missile Passes Tests on B-52 Bomber Missiles & Bombs News North Korea preparing to launch new missiles: report Missiles & Bombs News US can defend itself from North Korea missile attack: Pentagon Air Force & Aerospace News Israel Aerospace Industries Delivers First G550-Based AEW Aircraft to Italy MILITARY PICTURES FORUM DISCUSSIONS Forum Posts Forum Topics Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) News and Discussions US Navy News and updates Royal Air Force [RAF] discussions and updates aviation developments Usa Royal Australian Navy Discussions and Updates USAF News and Discussion Royal New Zealand Air Force ADF General discussion thread Indonesian Aero News The Indonesian Army Russia's Arctic Expansion War Against ISIS The Royal Navy Discussions and Updates Australian Army Discussions and Updates US Army News and updates general discussion Chinese Navy News and Discussion F-35 Program - General Discussion Adjusting tire pressure for tough underground (4:47 video) Adjusting tire pressure for tough underground (4:47 video) Low Probability of Detection/Intercept A part of the tank Abrams?

X President-elect playing his trump cards on social media With billions at stake, algorithms and apps have been developed to respond to Donald Trump’s Twitter trigger finger Fri, Jan 20, 2017, 05:00 Simon Carswell US president-elect Donald Trump. Photograph: Dominick Reuter/Getty Images         Most people are still struggling with Donald Trump’s flair for the unpredictable and his Twitter trigger finger. In business – where the unexpected costs money – life under the free-wheeling President Trump may be dicey. When the US president-elect tweeted last month to complain about the “tremendous cost and cost overruns” of Lockheed Martin’s F-35 fighter jet, the company’s shares fell about 2 per cent, shaving about $1.2 billion (€1.1 billion) off the company’s market value. Ten days earlier, he had knocked $4 billion off the company’s value with another tweet bemoaning the cost of the fighter. For the company, it was costly, being chided in public by Trump. For the incoming president, it proved the power of his new bully pulpit, all tweeted from the comfort of Trump Tower. Lockheed has said that it is trying to meet Trump’s demands for a reduction in costs. Other companies have felt Trump’s social media wrath as the negotiator-in-chief looks to publicly shame corporate giants into rolling in line with his “America First” economic policy. Boeing’s shares fell 1 per cent when Trump threatened (via Twitter) to cancel the order for a new Air Force One because the costs, at more than $4 billion were “out of control.” He threatened tariffs – “a big border tax” – on imported cars if Toyota, Ford and General Motors proceeded with plans to build new factories in Mexico. When companies cave and announce investments at home, he tweets to take credit, even if some of the plans have been in the works for a number of years. Tweet-watchers The corporate world has adapted quickly to the vagaries of Trump’s America. Sophisticated traders have created algorithms that allow automated programmes to play affected stocks as soon as Trump’s tweets. The app Trigger Finance notifies users if he tweets about a company in which they own stock. Tech companies in California have changed staff rosters so an employee is awake at 3am on the west coast when an energised Trump, waking up on the east coast, is at his most active on Twitter. Today’s inauguration might give his tweet-watchers a little time off. ADVERTISEMENT Trump’s transition to power has been a rollercoaster period for the business world. Market investors have basked in a post-election glow that often follows the election of new presidents. The benchmark S&P 500 has posted its biggest election-to-inauguration gain since Bill Clinton’s re-election in 1996. The index has risen 6 per cent since election day on November 8th, which, according to business news website Market Watch, is the fifth biggest election rally since Herbert Hoover’s victory in 1928. Company bosses and their shareholders are excited by Trump’s promises to reduce taxes and overhaul the American tax code, to row back burdensome regulations and to inject stimulus into the economy with a vast infrastructure programme. Financial stocks have risen by 18 per cent in anticipation of lower taxes and deregulation, targeting in particular the Dodd-Frank rules on Wall Street, under the Trump administration. American businesses are equally worried about his hard-nosed protectionism and threats to slap 35 per cent tariffs on the imports of companies that move their production abroad. Your guide to Inauguration Day At the bottom of the corporate ladder, those blue-collar workers who sealed Trump’s election victory in November seem to be thrilled at his enthusiasm to bully companies into protecting their jobs. Expectations While polls show that Trump will be the most unpopular president in at least four decades when he takes office today, he still scores best on expectations about the economy. Six in 10 Americans polled by ABC News this week said that they expected him to do an excellent or good job on the economy and jobs. In the heart of Trump country – the industrial midwest – businesses are waiting to see whether the incoming president comes good on the promises that drove so many to vote for him in those parts. “There is obviously a lot of unpredictability and a lot of unknown about the guy,” said Jim Galvin, a Cork native who co-owns Chicago-based biofuels business Lakeview Energy. The firm turns over $350 million a year and employs more than 300 people in Ohio, Iowa and Missouri. “Fundamentally, he is a businessman and if he sticks to that, we would be hopeful that he would be pro-business and pro the industry we are involved in. On the campaign trail, he showed a commitment to renewable fuels, but is he going to follow through?” Galvin exports biofuels to Brazil, China and Peru and, like other businesses in the midwest, particularly those in agriculture that rely heavily on exports, he is concerned about Trump’s tough-talk on China. “People are a little bit concerned if there is going to be a trade war here,” he said. Opening gambits Trump’s pick to be commerce secretary, billionaire investor Wilbur Ross, stuck with his new boss’s plans to overhaul the North America Free Trade Agreement – a regular Trump target on the campaign trail – through renegotiations with Canada and Mexico, but seemed keen to reassure business-friendly lawmakers that Trump’s threats of 35 per cent tariffs on Chinese products were just opening gambits of a dealmaker. “The president-elect has done a wonderful job preconditioning some of the other countries with whom we will be negotiating the change that is coming,” he told a US Senate’s commerce, science and transportation committee at his confirmation hearing on Wednesday. Ross – best known in Ireland for his lucrative post-crash punt on Bank of Ireland, and in the US as the “King of Bankruptcy” for turning around distressed businesses – pointed to the spoils of a lower corporate tax rate as the best means to make the American business environment competitive. Trump wants a 15 per cent rate, which would bring it close to and competitive with the Irish rate of 12.5 per cent, while Paul Ryan, the Republican speaker of the House of Representatives, believes 20 per cent is more realistic. It remains to be seen whether Trump’s tax reform will lead to a raid of Irish-based US multinational balance sheets rather than Irish workforces. American firms have tended to chose Ireland not for low-cost operations to sell product back into the US, but to serve customers in Europe or further afield. ADVERTISEMENT David O’Sullivan, executive director of the Ireland-US Council business organisation, said that Ireland has always avoided attracting “runaway-plant activity” – investing overseas as part of a strategy to evade high taxes or operating costs in the US, the kind of strategy that Trump targets almost daily on Twitter. “Ireland has never been in that game,” said the New York-based O’Sullivan, who moved to the US four decades ago to join IDA Ireland’s marketing operations in the US. Unintended benefit An unintended benefit to Ireland from a reduction in the American corporate tax rate, he says, will be the removal of the stigma of being “wrongly tagged as a tax haven” after years of negative press in the US. Among Trump’s tax reform plans is a one-off reduced repatriation levy to draw back an estimated $3 trillion of American corporate money stashed overseas, including in Ireland. Overhauling the tax code may not be as straightforward as Trump has promised. He has clashed with Republicans over their “border adjustment” tax, which would tax imports and exempt exports. “I don’t love it,” Trump told the Wall Street Journal of the proposal that is central to raising more than $1 trillion that would finance the overall reforms proposed by congressional Republicans. Without consensus even among his own party, tax reform could be a more protracted goal. Expect more angry tweets from the badgering Trump, and not just directed at US companies.       Topics: US Election Bill Clinton David O Sullivan Donald Trump Jim Galvin Wilbur Ross Bank of Ireland Boeing General Motors Lakeview Energy Lockheed Martin Toyota Read More Brexit ‘opportunity’ for UK to prove love of internationalism – May Snow patrol, the ‘flying bum’ and why ‘the squirrels are winning’ Wolfgang Munchau: populists can get the economy right Davos: HSBC to move some staff to Paris after Brexit UK house price index falls for first time in five months European Central Bank on ‘autopilot’ until summer Ibec chief predicts that UK and EU will not agree Brexit trade deal Brexit speech: Six issues that Theresa May didn’t settle for us Unemployment in Northern Ireland grew to 50,000, or 5.6%, in Q4 China’s economic growth to cool slightly this year, poll shows Subscribe.   More from The Irish Times Transport & Tourism Goldman Sachs and AIB team up for Glen of Downs Golf Club sale Work Getting criticism to deliver at work Golf Tiger Woods’ comeback ends in a missed cut at Torrey Pines Economy Planet Business: alternative facts and a dash of Musk Sponsored Retiring with financial security to the serenity of the Wicklow hills Opel OnStar puts personal assistance in the driving seat Plan your financial future and enjoy your dream retirement Leading the dance: 'Growing up competing I learned the drive to keep going' ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT Commenting on The Irish Times has changed.

At right, NASA project director Peter Zorba discusses the future removal of concrete and asphalt from the Delta test area. NASA continues to make progress in the cleanup of its portion of the Santa Susana Field Lab, with the second phase of demolition about 70 percent complete. The agency is overseeing the cleanup of all of Area II and part of Area I at the field lab in the hills of Simi Valley. These are the portions that belong to the federal government and comprise 20 percent of the site. The other 80 percent of the field lab belongs to Boeing Co. Since March, NASA has cleared out 11 potable water storage tanks and associated pipelines in the “Skyline area” in the southwest portion of Area II, inactive fuel farms in the historic Coca and Delta rocket test sites, and an old sewage treatment plant. Photos by MICHAEL COONSAcorn Newspapers Dormant power lines, transformers, poles and obsolete pipelines have also been removed, said Peter Zorba, NASA’s field lab project director. The second phase of demolition will continue next month with the removal of remaining concrete surfaces that have been deemed nonhazardous and obsolete structures in the former Delta test site, where large liquid propulsion systems were tested in the 1960s. The Delta rocket test stands were demolished in 1982. Zorba said Delta is the first of the four test areas at the 2,850- acre field lab to be cleaned up. He anticipates phase two of the razing will be completed by the end of this year, but officials still don’t know when the entire cleanup will be completed. “Pulling down service buildings, warehouse structures and steel buildings on flat concrete . . . was not that complex, but now we’re starting to get to the complexity of the demolition that’s a challenge (where) we’ve got to sit here, look at all the unknowns and figure out how we’re going to approach it,” Zorba said. ALL GONE—An area along the north side of the Santa Susana Field Lab, pictured Jan. 13, sits nearly empty after several buildings were demolished, and the asphalt and concrete removed. MICHAEL COONS/Acorn Newspapers “There’s a lot of preparation that goes into getting us where we’re at now because there’s no class or book on how to demolish a test stand. And the stands at SSFL are unlike any at other NASA locations because they are anchored in bedrock instead of concrete.” The field lab, built in 1947, was used as a nuclear test site and for research in the development of ballistic missiles, rockets and space shuttle equipment. In 1959, a partial nuclear meltdown occurred in Area IV, which is in the 80 percent of the field lab owned by Boeing. Toxic cleanup of the field lab began in 2010, with NASA overseeing the federal government’s portion, and the U.S. Department of Energy and the Department of Toxic Substances Control managing Boeing’s portion. NASA began its first phase of demolition in 2014, which included taking down the service areas and office buildings in the Delta area. That work was completed in December 2015. “I’m very proud of my NASA predecessors who did amazing things here (at SSFL), like developing the rockets that put us into space, put a man on the moon and ended the Cold War,” Zorba said. “I want to continue that work but . . . the work I’m doing, in a sense, is deconstructing a lot of what was constructed to bring the site back to as much of a normal condition as possible.” NASA, Boeing and the DOE are waiting on the DTSC’s final environmental impact report, a state-issued document expected to be released in the next couple of months outlining the remediation responsibilities for all the agencies. “We have to plan (remediation) according to the conditions, which vary from area to area,” Zorba said. “There’s no one silver bullet to fix everything. You have to look at each of these areas uniquely. The demolition is the first step in the cleanup process.” Return to top Copyright © 2004-2017 J.Bee NP Publishing, Ltd., All Rights Reserved.

Tags MH370 Malaysia Malaysia to offer reward for missing Flight MH370 Reuters | Thursday, Jan 19, 2017 Photo: AFP Reuters Thursday, Jan 19, 2017 KUALA LUMPUR - Malaysia said on Thursday it would pay a reward to any private company that found the fuselage of missing Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370, days after a fruitless, three-year hunt was suspended. Australia, Malaysia and China ended the search for the aircraft on Tuesday, leaving one of the world's greatest aviation mysteries unanswered. The Boeing 777 jet disappeared in March 2014, en route to Beijing from the Malaysian capital of Kuala Lumpur, with 239 people on board. Malaysian Deputy Transport Minister Abdul Aziz Kaprawi said the government was open to credible private companies searching for it, and would reward any that found its fuselage. "All costs must be borne by them. We will only reward them if they are successful," Abdul Aziz told Reuters. 283465 2016-03-24 11:42:49 Photo Gallery Debris found in Africa most likely belongs to MH370, says Australia Source: AFP, Reuters, Courtesy of Blaine Gibson He said the size of the reward had not been decided. Any company intending to search should contact the government, and a decision would then be made on the reward, he said. The search of a 120,000 sq km area of the Indian Ocean cost about A$200 million ($150 million). But the three countries involved were reluctant to keep looking without new evidence about the plane's final resting place. Flight MH370 lost contact over the Gulf of Thailand in the early hours of March 8, 2014. Subsequent analysis of radar and satellite contacts suggested someone on board may have deliberately switched off the plane's transponder before diverting it thousands of kilometres out over the Indian Ocean. Since the crash, there have been competing theories over whether the plane was hijacked and whether it was under the control of anyone when it finally ran out of fuel. 'NOT HAPPY' The end of the underwater search drew swift and angry reactions from relatives of those on board, who have repeatedly called for the hunt to be expanded. "We know the next-of-kin are not happy when we suspended the search," said Abdul Aziz. "We can't proceed until there is new evidence, but if there are credible companies that want to take on the search, then why not?" he said. The only confirmed traces of the plane have been three pieces of debris found washed up on the island country Mauritius, the French island Reunion and an island off Tanzania. As many as 30 other pieces of wreckage found there and on beaches in Mozambique, Tanzania and South Africa are suspected to have come from the plane. On Wednesday, Australia said it was not ruling out a future underwater search. Malaysia holds ultimate responsibility for the search given Malaysia Airlines is registered there. The aircraft is thought to have crashed west of Australia, placing it in its maritime zone of responsibility. Most of the passengers were from China. Abdul Aziz said the search costs had been borne by the three countries while the aircraft-maker, Boeing, had not committed anything. "There's been no funding from Boeing," he said. Boeing said in a statement it provided technical expertise and assistance, principally as advisers to government investigative authorities. "In addition, at the direction and under the supervision of investigating authorities, Boeing provides exemplar hardware, testing analysis and laboratory services," the company said.

In the past, the swearing in of a new President was always a day of nationwide celebrations, whoever was the new man, be he a Republican or Democrat. However, today’s event is beclouded by unprecedented circumstances. It is quite unusual, if not unprecedented, for the swearing in of a new President of the United States to be marked by nationwide protests against the new man in the White House. These protests have been on for some days and may continue for a few more days. One point of interest is that a chunk of the protesters strongly believe that the defeated Democratic party candidate, Hillary Clinton, was cheated in the election or that President Donald Trump’s victory was manipulated by a foreign power, Russia. Yet, it would be wrong to claim that Clinton instigated the protests. When there were similar post-election protests in Nigeria in the past, the same Hillary Clinton, then American Secretary of State, came here and echoed the blackmail that Muhammadu Buhari instigated the protests. As argued in this column at that time, such protests or violence were ever spontaneous, a reflection of the anger of the electorate who might have felt cheated of victory. The protests in the U.S. against the outcome of the recent presidential election are obviously one final combative gesture against the shock victory of Trump against political pundits’ predictions all over the world, discrediting, among others, pollsters and even the media. Never in America’s history had there been such a one-man political assault that upturned all known established records. Candidate Trump defied even his Republican party, which disowned him throughout the campaigns. Such was the unprecedented political feat, which compelled searches for what might have gone wrong with everybody except one man, Donald Trump. One such major reason detected was the alleged interference of rival Russia in the American presidential election in favour of Trump. Notably, throughout his campaign for the election, Trump was effusive in praise of Russian President Vladimir Putin. Could Trump have been complicit in the alleged Russian interference in the American presidential election? In the past,  an allegation of this nature was enough to cost Trump the election. But here was a candidate embraced by the electorate on his personal merit even against his party. Whichever was the case, could such Russian interference eventually affect the legitimacy of Trump’s presidency and to what degree? Unless he commits an impeachable offence, Trump’s presidency seems secure. Yet,  beyond party lines, politicians in the U.S. congress have, indeed, commenced hearings on investigations (by various security agencies) into the truth or otherwise of the alleged Russian interference in the presidential election. The alleged Russian interference focused on the hacking of apparatchiks at the national headquarters of Democratic Party. Either because indications of alleged Russian interference were not taken seriously or because the threat of the Russians was too overwhelming to be neutralised, American authorities had enough time to neutralize the saboteurs, who still succeeded in ridiculing the entire American political, administrative and security system. The protest, though, is massive. Demonstrations are planned for 60 American cities, attracting up to one million protesters, with about two hundred thousand celebrating the inauguration of the new President. The protests were avoidable, if only those involved discharged their civic obligation in the first place. Failure in this aspect accounted for democratic candidate Clinton’s total score of over three million popular votes than President Trump but scattered over less number of states than Trump, which was inadequate under the American electoral system to win the presidency. Trump is being sworn in today not because he won more popular votes but because fewer voters turned out. African-Americans in particular gave the impression that their obligation to the Democrats ended with Barack Obama’s presidency. In fact, Obama, in the last days of the campaigns, desperately pleaded that American minorities should came out to vote, if only to help preserve his legacy. The racist undertones of American minorities boycotting the polls partly cost Clinton and the Democrats the presidency. For a political maverick, the early days of the Trump presidency could prove more rewarding than Americans might bargain for. Throughout the campaigns, Trump described outsourcing American manufacturing jobs as detrimental to employment prospects at home. Trump, therefore, pledged to impose a tariff of 35 per cent on manufactured goods imported into the U.S., especially from neighbouring Mexico. Since Trump’s election victory, some of the companies targeted, such as Toyota and General Motors, have decided to re-open plants in the U.S. The decision will save the companies the high tariff but also create thousands of new jobs in the motor manufacturing industries in the U.S. Amazon and Wallmat have also joined in plans to create hundreds of thousands of new jobs. Boeing is another major manufacturer that has kowtowed before America’s new strongman. When it was announced after Trump’s victory that the presidential fleet would be replaced with new aircraft, including Air Force One, Trump rejected the idea, saying that he did not require an air transport fleet at over $5 billion, which he considered too expensive. He, therefore, pledged to cancel the contract after assuming office. In the past few weeks, Boeing has slashed the projected cost of the new presidential fleet to just above $3 billion, a saving of almost $2 billion. A maverick like Trump may turn out to be the man America needs to sustain job creation and ensure reasonable contract costs. By the way, it is instructive that while Obama is sustaining democracy with a glorious exit from office as President of the United States, after his tenure of eight years. Yahya Jammeh is being forced out of office in The Gambia in West Africa for attempting to perpetuate himself in office after 22 years. The difference is clear. Obasanjo among Nigerians Re-Zik, Awo, others on Obasanjo Until that man educates Nigerians on how his post-prison N20,000 and President’s earnings for eight years catapulted him into a billionaire, all his anti-corruption talk comea to naught. Agubamah c.a.t. Obasanjo is a brave coward. He does not know what time is it. He so much believes in the I, ME and MYSELF concept. Ikeri Dominic, 08037234771 In all honesty, we still need your brain in this country.          Fatola IBD. Oga, you too much. God bless you and grant you more wisdom IJN. Alex, from Umuahia, 08068156745 Thanks for your piece on Zik, Awo, others on Obasanjo. Excellent as always. I thought you would have put a line on his refusal to respond to Oba Adetona’s question to him regarding his possible interest in Obajana cement, only for him to arrange for Aliko Dangote to address the Oba on it years later. How not to be a man of honour indeed! 08033066518 The column on Obasanjo (Daily Sun, January 14, page 47) is a masterpiece. Bravo. Where can I buy a copy of Condoleezza Rice’s memoir and what cost? Akaninyeye Ekukinam 08084008411 I have repeatedly said that Obasanjo is the coward and liar of the century. He is a hypocrite who fears some people from a “certain area or zone” but makes scapegoats of the perceived weak and helpless. When General Danjuma dared him on OPL 246, what did he do? He chickened out. Let him wait for Atiku Abubakar to become President and he will return to jail to complete the Abacha sentence or perish there. Those eulogising Obasanjo as a messiah are to blame. He once said that Abiola was not the messiah, only for the same Obasanjo to benefit from Abiola’s demise. Obasanjo’s rhetoric about the oneness of Nigeria is borne out of cowardice rather than patriotism. See how he dramatised his withdrawal from the PDP, an act he exhibited for fear of Buhari’s emergence as President. If anyone should remain in PDP, it ought to be Obasanjo, being the biggest single beneficiary of the party. His day of judgment is nigh. W. Page, 08177010143 I wonder how you did not get concerned how hundreds of people were killed in Kaduna and you kept mute because of your man, President Muhammadu Buhari. History and God of journalism will not forgive you. Do you think looking the other way is the solution? This is the change for which you canvassed. May God save us from this government of tribalism. 08033212172 Honestly, as usual, you rightly put Obasanjo where he belongs. But the issue is whether the man has conscience at all. If, at his age and exposure, he cannot initiate what will foster the unity of this country for the fear one administration may surpass him in progress, then it is unfortunate of him. I have never read of him organising a genuine national peace reconciliation even among his peers, that is, the elite of this country, to calm nerves in some cases, which would not cost him one kobo. He will never think of that. Instead, it is always his personal self-glorification from here or there. But, as you said, we should forget him and move on. 08091985441 How I cure baldness using these natural techniques. Read story 23 yrs boy started importation with N10,450. Read his story here!

Credit: SpaceX The successful launch of a Falcon 9 rocket this weekend sets the stage for Elon Musk's SpaceX to regain momentum following its launch pad accident last fall, but the company is not out of the woods yet. With the Federal Aviation Administration's blessings, SpaceX settled on a short-term solution to fix the problem that caused a booster to burst into flames on Sept. 1 as it was being fueled for a routine prelaunch test. Modifying the fueling procedures, as demonstrated during SpaceX's launch Saturday from California, is a first step. The company is working on a new design for the containers of helium that sit inside of the rocket's fuel tanks to maintain pressure. Accident investigators traced the cause of the launch pad fireball to a helium canister in the rocket's upper stage liquid oxygen tank that failed. NASA will be closely watching SpaceX's progress. The U.S. space agency has hired SpaceX, along with industry stalwart Boeing, to fly astronauts to the International Space Station, hopefully before the end of 2018. Since the space shuttles were retired in 2011, the United States has been dependent on Russia for crew transportation services. SpaceX's plan to fuel its rockets after the crew is aboard has raised questions by NASA safety advisory groups. SpaceX super-chills its propellants to make them denser so more can fit inside the tanks. The rockets need the extra power so they can not only boost their payloads into orbit, but turn around and land back on Earth as well. SpaceX's ambitious business plans are based on reusing its rockets, which dramatically cuts the cost of flying in space. RELATED: SpaceX Makes Spectacular Return to Flight, Launching 10 Satellites Into Orbit Loading the cryogenics just before launch keeps them from boiling off as the rocket awaits liftoff. Skeptics say the procedure, known as "load and go," adds extra risk, particularly when humans are aboard, and figuring out how much risk is, in itself, another problem. "Despite testing at the component and subassembly level, systems often display 'emergent' behavior once they are used in the actual operational environment. We are concerned that any determination of risk associated with 'load and go' would have signicant uncertainty," the Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel said in its annual report to NASA and Congress, which was released last week. "We strongly encourage NASA top management to scrutinize this issue and ensure that any decision to accept additional risk … is justified by the value that will be gained. The decision should not be unduly influenced by other secondary factors such as schedule and budget concerns," the panel added. NASA is particularly sensitive to issues of crew safety. Two space shuttle crews were killed during the program's 30-year history due to equipment failures triggered by unexpected and seemingly benign operating environments that turned out to be deadly. The 1986 Challenger explosion was due to a booster rocket O-ring that failed after a Florida freeze. The ring allow hot gases to escape from the rocket, triggering a catastrophic explosion 73 seconds after liftoff, killing seven crewmembers. RELATED: Will SpaceX Get People to Mars Before NASA? A second shuttle, Columbia, was destroyed as it flew through the atmosphere for landing in 2003. Unbeknownst to NASA, the spaceship's left wing had been damaged 16 days earlier when a suitcase-sized piece of foam insulation fell off the external fuel tank during liftoff. NASA didn't know the lightweight foam could punch a hole into a wing panel made of reinforced carbon composites. The accident claimed another crew of seven. "The trick is to recognize when the hardware is talking to you BEFORE an accident occurs and react to it," said Mike Leinbach, a former shuttle launch director who led a team that literally pieced together debris and flight data recovered from the Columbia accident to determine the cause of the accident. "For new hardware and its new managers, being proactive can be very elusive, especially if complacency and/or overconfidence sets in following a few successful missions," Leinbach told Seeker. "Be ever vigilant, (which is) easy to say, hard to do. And harder yet if egos cloud good judgment and engineering decisions." NASA's goal for the new space taxis is that they reduce the odds of losing a crew on any one flight to 1-in-270, which is about three times better than the risk of flying on the shuttle following post-accident improvements. The primary threat to the new vehicles comes frompotential orbital debris impacts. SpaceX plans an unmanned test flight of its passenger Dragon spaceship in November. Boeing is targeting a similar test of its CST-100 Starliner for June 2018. WATCH VIDEO: Space Can Make You Go Blind Originally published on Seeker.

By Rachel Middleton January 20, 2017 00:31 GMT Close Malaysia Airlines MH370 search to be suspended Reuters Two days after calling off the official search for missing Malaysia Airlines MH370, the Malaysian government has offered a reward to any private investigation that successfully locates the missing fuselage. Malaysia, China and Australia announced on Tuesday (17 January) that the underwater search operation for the missing airline had been suspended, halting a three-year hunt for the Boeing 777 that mysteriously vanished while en-route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing in March 2014. The aircraft was carrying 239 people on board. Most of the passengers were from China. Malaysian Deputy Transport Minister Abdul Aziz Kaprawi told Reuters that the government was open to "credible private companies" searching for the missing plane. "All costs must be borne by them. We will only reward them if they are successful," he said. The size of the reward has not been determined but he said, any company planning to embark on the search should first contact the government. A decision on the reward would then be made, he said. Women look at a mural of missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 two years after it disappeared, in Kuala Lumpur, MalaysiaOlivia Harris/ Reuters "We can't proceed until there is new evidence, but if there are credible companies that want to take on the search, then why not?" said the Malaysian minister. Malaysia, China and Australia launched an underwater search covering 120,000 square km (46,000 sq miles) in the Indian Ocean. The search cost around A$200m (£113m). But after three years and with nothing to show, the three countries announced the suspension of the search unless there is "credible new information which leads to a specific location", according to Australia's Transport Minister Darren Chester. Any decision to resume search operations will also be at the discretion of the Malaysian government, Chester told reporters on 18 January. So far, only three pieces of debris that washed up in Mauritius, Reunion and an island off Tanzania have been confirmed as belonging to the Boeing aircraft. Costs of the search Abdul Aziz told Reuters that the cost of the search so far had been borne by the three countries. Boeing, the aircraft maker, had not committed anything. "There's been no funding from Boeing," he said. In a statement, Boeing said that it had provided technical expertise and assistance, principally as advisers to government investigative authorities. "In addition, at the direction and under the supervision of investigating authorities, Boeing provides exemplar hardware, testing analysis and laboratory services," Boeing said.

The Chinese business magnate earlier in January met with US President-elect Donald Trump, who has bemoaned the loss of American industry and jobs due to the outsourcing of labor to countries like Mexico and China. Ma, however, has a different view of what is behind the US economic decline. “Over the past thirty years, the Americans had thirteen wars spending 40.2 trillion dollars,” said Ma, speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos. “What if they spent a part of that money on building up the infrastructure, helping the white-collar and the blue-collar workers? No matter how strategically good it is, you’re supposed to spend money on your own people.” “And the other money which I’m curious about is that when I was young, all I heard about America was Ford and Boeing and those big manufacturing companies. The last 10-20 years, all I heard about is Silicon Valley and Wall Street,” he continued. Read more ‘Globalization not to blame for world turmoil’ – Davos forum founder “And what happened? The year 2008: the financial crisis wiped out 19.2 trillion dollars in the USA alone and destroyed 34 million jobs globally. So what if the spent on Wall Street and the Middle East was spent on the Mid-West of the United States, developing the industry there? That could change a lot.” According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute , the United States spent $596 billion, or 3.3 percent of its GDP, on military expenditure in 2015, which is higher than any other country in the world. In Ma’s opinion, this is partly responsible for the loss of jobs in America’s Rust Belt. “So it’s not that other countries steal jobs from you guys, it is your strategy! You do not distribute the money in a proper way,” he summarized. Ma also expressed the view that overall globalization was a positive thing as it had brought many benefits to both China and the world. However, it should be improved by making more room for small businesses rather than the current system run by the World Trade Organization (WTO), which was developed to protect corporate interests. “The WTO was great but it was mainly designed for developed countries and big companies. There’s no opportunity for small business. We want to build up an EWTP – an Electronic World Trade Platform – to support young people, small business.” READ MORE: Beijing ready to talk to resolve trade issues with Washington “And the other thing is that the WTO is a very interesting organization. When you put 200 government officials in one room, ask them to agree on something – it’s impossible! I can never imagine that they agree on something together. Business should be designed by business people, so we believe the EWTP should have businessmen sitting down together, agree on something, negotiate on something, then get endorsement from the government.” READ MORE: Open Sesame?

(Brian Cassella / Chicago Tribune) Kim JanssenContact ReporterChicago Tribune He's been bounced out of the U.S. Senate, but will Mark Kirk's landing spot be just down the road at Washington's home of lobbying, K Street? Speaking Thursday night at the Heartland Ball, a bipartisan celebration of the presidential inauguration for Illinoisans in D.C., the former U.S. senator told Chicago Inc. that he's seriously thinking of starting his own lobbying firm, or, as he called it, a "strategic consultancy." Though Kirk said he hasn't made a final decision on what the next chapter of his life will be, he said, "I'll probably set up a firm of my own to work with my expertise on behalf of large employers in Illinois to ensure that they are well represented in Washington, D.C." Kirk said he expected to open offices both in D.C. and in his hometown of Highland Park, and that he had "two unique angles." He'd represent "big Illinois outfits in Washington, and also in Beijing," he said, adding that he is planning to go to Beijing "under the sponsorship of the Chinese government." "They regularly bring over retired senators, so there's seven or eight of us going on an exchange visit to China," he said. "I've already talked to Boeing," he said, adding that he had discussed President-elect Donald Trump's Twitter rant against Boeing with the company. Asked by a reporter if President Barack Obama had ever invited him to fly aboard Air Force One, built by Boeing, Kirk responded, "No, white Republicans don't get invited to go on those kind of trips."

By Carolyn Lamberson carolynl@spokesman.com(509) 459-5068 Twitter Facebook  Email  Reddit  SMS Josh Armstrong admits it wasn’t easy to keep it a secret. It’s not every day that Gonzaga University’s Comprehensive Leadership Program is able to sneak a multi-Grammy winner onto campus. They did that on Wednesday when Ryan Lewis of the hip-hop duo Macklemore and Ryan Lewis showed up to talk to leadership students as part of the program’s regular Fishbowl series. “We only told two students who were working it,” said Armstrong, who is the program’s director. “I found myself wanting to tell people, but we kept the surprise.” The producer, photographer, video director, DJ and videographer who grew up in Spokane spoke to a standing-room-only crowd of 200 students. Keeping the event secret, Armstrong said, helped make sure it would be oriented to questions of leadership, and not be a “fanboy conversation.” “(Wednesday) was the first day of school, so that helped. It was something we could keep quiet. That part was fun as well,” Armstrong said. “We weren’t wanting it to be where 1,200 students show up to an event with him.” Armstrong, who met the Lewis family in the 1990s and has stayed in touch, said guests for the once-a-semester Fishbowl talks typically come from the world of nonprofits and business. Guests have been vice presidents at Boeing or Starbucks. They once brought in Bill Gates, Sr., and the next speaker is from Alaska Airlines. This is the first time organizers have brought in a musician. “We haven’t had anyone who has won Grammys or had number one hits,” Armstrong said. “Thankfully, Ryan has done a lot of thinking about leadership and shaping culture.” The evening was conversational, Armstrong said. Half of the night was devoted to answering student questions, while the rest centered on a conversation between Armstrong and Lewis. According to the Gonzaga News Service – the only media invited – the conversation ranged from how to find success in music without a record deal and finding time to learn to play piano to Lewis’ charitable work and social activism. Lewis talked about the social issues songs that Macklemore and Ryan Lewis release, such as “Same Love,” in support of marriage equality, or “White Privilege II,” which centers on race. Lewis said he understands that these “heavy” songs aren’t songs people will listen to over and over, as they might the hit songs “Thrift Shop” or “Can’t Hold Us.” The goal of these songs, he said, is to spark conversation. “Heavy good songs that say something should be made and should be played,” Lewis said. “I hope our fans are able to have fun with songs that are fun and have ears and a willingness to have dialogue they might not have had” over the more “heavy” songs. When asked about strategies to become a good leader, Lewis suggested people lean into their strengths and know themselves. “For me, I’m reliable for honesty but I’m not necessarily reliable for making you feel good,” he said. “People are combinations of toolsets and character qualities. It all comes down to ‘how do I say what I need to say but not crush you and at the same time be effective.’” Lewis was born on the West Side, but moved to Spokane as a toddler. He attended school here, before moving to Seattle, where he finished high school. He and Macklemore made music history with their 2012 album “The Heist”: They were the first duo ever to score number one hits with their first two singles, “Thrift Shop” and “Can’t Hold Us.” He and Macklemore have been regular visitors to Spokane, playing sold out shows at the Knitting Factory, the Spokane Arena’s Star Theatre and, most recently, the Bing Crosby Theater. He and Macklemore filmed the video for their song “Downtown” here, and performed a free concert for students at Eastern Washington University in 2013. He graduated from the University of Washington with a degree in the history of comparative ideas – which is analogous to a philosophy degree. Those who meet Lewis often come away impressed by how well-spoken and thoughtful he is. The GU students found that as well. “We heard from students that they didn’t expect a musician to be that thoughtful,” Armstrong said.

Budget carrier Norwegian Air (norwegian.com/us) has announced that it is launching non-stop, low-cost flights between Stewart International Airport, 70 miles north of Manhattan, and various destinations in Europe. The budget carrier expects to offer 21 flights a week from the Orange County, New York airport, to England, Scotland, Ireland and Norway. Trips will be aboard Boeing’s 737 Max, which has a single aisle and carries 189 passengers. Compared to bigger jets, the smaller, narrow-body plane costs less to operate.

James Lawler Duggan/Reuters | Caption Fullscreen Loading... Linda Feldmann Staff writer | @linda_feldmann Francine Kiefer Staff writer | @kieferf Story Hinckley Staff writer | @storyhinckley January 20, 2017 Washington—“We all want the same thing,” President Donald Trump said Friday to members of Congress and other dignitaries. “We're all good people, whether you're a Republican or Democrat, it doesn't make any difference. We're going to get along.” President Trump’s message of goodwill at the traditional post-inaugural congressional luncheon seemed more an expression of hope over reality, in a political system that has grown increasingly polarized over the years. And as violence broke out on the streets of Washington Friday – away from the inaugural festivities but aimed at marring an otherwise orderly transfer of presidential power – it was clear that words alone will not be enough to heal the nation’s divisions. Protesters threw rocks, smashed windows, and lit small fires; police deployed tear gas and flash bangs. Six officers were injured, and 217 protesters were arrested. The last time there was large-scale unrest at an inauguration was in 1969, when antiwar protests led to dozens of arrests. In all, it made for moments of anger and frustration, but violence didn’t typify the day. Groups of people wearing “Make America Great Again” caps walked by anti-Trump groups wearing pink knitted hats – the headgear of choice for Saturday’s big women’s march – and seemed to largely ignore each other. Could you pass a US citizenship test? Find out. Inauguration Day, of course, brings many who wish to celebrate and support the man they sent to Washington. Theirs were expressions of joy on a day meant to celebrate a hallmark of American democracy – the peaceful transfer of power. From left, Amy Kelash, Ann Kelash, and Jeb Strehlo call family members from National Mall after arriving on a bus from Gilman, Minn., for the 58th Presidential Inauguration on Friday in Washington. Ann Hermes/The Christian Science Monitor | Caption The Graham family – mom, dad, and college student son – drove in overnight from Bristol, Tenn., to show their support for the new president, waving Trump flags and wearing Trump hats and T-shirts. None had ever attended an inauguration before. So why now? “Because I’m a huge supporter of Donald Trump, and I think he’ll make America great again,” said Steve Graham, an electrician. How? Mr. Graham has a ready list: fixing the economy, securing the border, strengthening the military. “I think he’s a man of his word, and he’ll hold true to it.” His wife, Darlene Graham, a realtor, says her No. 1 reason for supporting Trump is “his stand with Jesus Christ and his support for the state of Israel.” Mr. Graham expects quick action, and quick results. Ms. Graham gives Trump a year to improve the nation. And son Justin says he’ll assess Trump’s performance by the midterm elections in 2018. Everybody, it seemed, was eager to express their opinions – with both supporters and detractors expressing outsize views about the man and what he can accomplish. Polarized opinions Mary Moga did not vote for Trump. Nor did she vote for Hillary Clinton. And yet, standing before the festooned Capitol as the seated inaugural audience began to break up, she described the experience as “electric” and “surreal.” She came, she said, because “it’s about the US.” But she also came to march. Ms. Moga, who is from Seattle, and her cousin, Debby Burger of San Diego, both plan to take part in the Women’s March on Washington Saturday. Ms. Burger campaigned for Hillary Clinton. Just as a reporter asked what they thought of the speech, Moga’s daughter – one of five children she’s raised – passed by answering, “It was a joke.” Cousin Burger chimed in. “He’s promising all these things he never could do.” “I just hope and pray he surrounds himself with quality people,” added Moga. Spectators wait in the rain on the National Mall in Washington Friday before the presidential inauguration of Donald Trump. John Minchillo/AP | Caption Chad Suenram, standing rows away from where Donald Trump had just given his inauguration speech, came away feeling completely the opposite. He says he was “blown away.” What he really liked was Trump’s message about “the positivity of the US prospering, of everyone growing together and just bringing back America.” The promise of prosperity was the main reason Mr. Suenram, who has four kids, voted for Trump. The Kansan, wearing an “All Lives Matter” button on his sweatshirt, says he came from “a struggle,” growing up in a trailer park. He started his own business in landscaping and has combined it with a foreclosure business. Through that, he’s seen a lot of families get kicked out of their homes. “Like Barack Obama said, ‘It’s time for change,’ ” Suenram grinned. The businessman, who jumped on a plane at the last minute to get to Washington, echoed much of what Trump said in his inaugural speech. His greatest hope for the years ahead is that America prosper, “and for the wealth to come back to the common people.” For Gordon Swanson, a retired Boeing employee from Everett, Wash., who flew in two days ago to celebrate, the joy of watching Trump came with a bitter note. He hadn’t put on his crisp, red “Make America Great Again” cap until he arrived at Union Station that morning, when inauguration revelers began to arrive. “I knew I potentially would be challenged by somebody” who didn’t agree with Trump, he said. “It didn’t used to be this way,” he lamented, saying that the country had turned too far to the left under President Obama, whom he described as “negligent.” This day was about the future, he said. “I hope his nominee for the Supreme Court will have a big effect. I’m not so worried about myself, but I’ve got three grandkids,” he said, perched on a stool beside an eatery at Union Station, Washington’s main train station. Beyond the pageant Outside the secure inauguration area, the scene was dramatically different. By early afternoon, thousands of protesters walked down I Street toward Franklin Square waving posters for Black Lives Matter, Dakota Access Pipeline resistance, and lesbian, gay, transgender, and bisexual rights. The march seemed orderly enough – thousands of people sticking to the streets while pedestrians took pictures from the sidewalks, some of them wearing "Make America Great Again" hats. But an undercurrent of hostility eventually broke through. A nearby Starbucks and Bank of America ATM station had their glass windows shattered by protesters. Armed guards stood nearby to prevent looting, and stores put up makeshift “closed” signs – though customers were still inside. Pro- and anti-Trump chants sprang up, with one protester telling a young man in a red hat, "Join us. We are doing this for you, too." Protesters burn trash outside the offices of The Washington Post as they react to the swearing in of President Donald Trump in Washington Friday. James Lawler Duggan/Reuters | Caption Eventually, some of the demonstrators began throwing rocks and bottles at police officers. Newspaper vending machines outside The Washington Post were tipped over and set on fire. At other locations around the city, protesters tried to block access to various inaugural events, though there were no other reports of violence. Beneath the tension was a sense of determination. Hillary Klein was at the protests with her sister, who was dressed as Lady Liberty with a red sash reading “RESISTANCE.” To her, the day reinforced a sense of community. “The one thing that has given me a real sense of hope since the election is the real sense that we do have each other's backs – people saying that to me, and me saying that to other people. [We’re] saying, 'I've got your back, and I've got your back, and we're going to get through this together,” Ms. Klein said. “It’s about making sure nobody feels alone in these moments.” Follow Stories Like This Get the Monitor stories you care about delivered to your inbox.

Find out why. Dan Caplinger (TMFGalagan) Jan 20, 2017 at 6:52PM Friday was a positive day for the stock market. The Dow Jones Industrials climbed by 95 points and there were similarly modest advances for the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite. The inauguration of the 45th president of the U.S. commanded the attention of many, both on and off Wall Street today, but many market participants pointed to the day's gains as a natural bounce after five straight days of losses for the Dow. With the broader market waiting for more clarity on the political and economic outlook looking ahead to the rest of the year, many investors looked to individual stocks rather than the market, as a whole. Among the worst performers today were Rite Aid (NYSE:RAD), Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY), and TransDigm Group (NYSE:TDG). Below, we'll look more closely at these stocks to tell you why they did so poorly. Image source: Rite Aid. Rite Aid investors fear FTC rejection Rite Aid plunged 13% in the wake of reports that the Federal Trade Commission might oppose its proposed merger with Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA). Rite Aid had hoped that its proposal to sell 865 of its drugstore locations to Fred's (NASDAQ:FRED) would be enough to satisfy the FTC, but skeptics are concerned that Fred's might not have the capacity to provide ample competition to Walgreens and CVS Health if the Rite Aid merger happens. After today's drop, Rite Aid trades at a 17% discount to the proposed $9 per-share buyout price, and that shows just how scared investors are that the deal won't go through as planned. Bristol-Myers Squibb slows down Bristol-Myers Squibb dropped 11% after saying late Thursday that it would not seek an accelerated regulatory review from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for its proposed combination therapy for lung cancer. Many investors had hoped that the combination of its Yervoy and Opdivo drugs would prove effective enough to spur Bristol to look for fast-track approval, especially in light of the FDA approval of a key competitor's drug for lung cancer. Nevertheless, Bristol didn't give details in its release, leaving many to speculate that the treatment's effectiveness might not have been as high as they had hoped. Now, investors will have to wait to see Bristol's next move. TransDigm loses altitude Finally, TransDigm Group lost 10%. The aerospace components and systems supplier found itself the target of short-selling research firm Citron Research and analyst Andrew Left, whose report suggested that the company might be "the Valeant of the aerospace industry." In particular, the report capitalized on criticism that President Trump has attributed to Boeing and Lockheed Martin, suggesting that the pricing practices that TransDigm uses could be even more egregious. Citron's valuation of the stock wasn't quite as dire as some of its past calls have been, suggesting that the shares might be worth $166. Yet that's still more than 25% lower than where TransDigm closed today, and it will be interesting to see if the new president takes note of the attack from Left. Dan Caplinger owns shares of Boeing.

The ULA Atlas V launching. Image: united launch alliance By Miriam Kramer2017-01-21 02:02:43 UTC The day Donald Trump was sworn in as president, this rocket was busy ditching Earth.  The rose gold-hued Atlas V lifted off from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida at 7:42 p.m. ET on Friday.  SEE ALSO: This rocket company clearly wants to be as cool as SpaceX The rocket's payload — the Air Force's Space-Based Infrared System (SBIRS) GEO Flight 3 satellite — is designed to help detect missile launches worldwide. The SBIRS mission is "considered one of the nation's highest priority space programs," according to the United Launch Alliance (ULA), which sent the rocket into space.  While the ULA launch and the presidential inauguration weren't related, it didn't stop people (including this reporter) from making jokes about the timing of the two events.

You can check out the full launch webcast in the window below. This launch was the Atlas V's 69th mission in total, and ULA's first of 2017. The company is expected to launch 11 rockets this year.

Scott Applewhite-Pool/Getty Images President Donald Trump Andrew Left of Citron Research, the short seller that helped bring Valeant Pharmaceuticals down to its knees, has chosen to make a very specific Trump trade public on the day of the president's inauguration: Bet against airplane parts manufacturer TransDigm Group. Quotes in the article TransDigm Group Inc TDG ▼ 219.00 -0.90 -0.41% Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc VRX ▼ 13.47 -0.15 -1.10% Boeing Co BA ▼ 167.70 -1.42 -0.84% Credit Suisse Group AG CSGKF ▼ 15.28 -0.48 -3.05% After Left published a paper Friday predicting that President Donald Trump will crack down on the prices of aerospace industry goods, shares of $13 billion TransDigm plunged as much as 13%. That made the stock the worst performing on the S&P 500 around noon that day. It also caused the company to shed $1.4 billion in market cap by the market's close. President Trump has become to aerospace what Hillary was to pharmaceuticals, Left wrote. He has already made lowering prices for military aircraft a pillar of his transition into office. Left pointed to two of Trump's tweets as a sign that the president won't be soft on aerospace and defense. On Dec. 6, Trump wrote that the cost of a Boeing Air Force One is out of control. Roughly a week later, he called out the cost of Lockheed and Martin's F-35, writing that billions of dollars can and will be saved on military (and other) purchases after January 20. The short seller argues that Trump should target TransDigm in the future because the company appears to have arbitrarily hiked the price of its goods. TransDigm is also highly susceptible to Trump's influence because the Department of Defense is TransDigm's single largest customer. Later on Friday, Credit Suisse analyst Robert Spingarn defended the company. While he conceded that TransDigm's goods are expensive, he added that the company has a higher growth rate and profitability than its peers. Additionally, if Trump tried to lower the prices, investors would see the warning signs. If the government were to pursue lower prices from TransDigm, we would expect this to be a lengthy process, Spingarn wrote. One thing we can't account for is 'tweet risk,' but we think the likelihood of this making it to Trump's tweet desk is low, and the likelihood of singling out a single aerospace parts supplier is even lower.

From Wal-Mart to General Motors to Amazon, a growing number of the world's largest companies appear to be trying to get in step with President Donald Trump's demand that employers hire and keep jobs at home. By JOSH BOAK, Associated Press Published: January 20, 2017, 4:12 PM A   A WASHINGTON — From Wal-Mart to General Motors to Amazon, a growing number of the world’s largest companies appear to be trying to get in step with President Donald Trump’s demand that employers hire and keep jobs at home. Trump, in response, has taken to Twitter to signal his approval. “Thank you to General Motors and Walmart for starting the big jobs push back into the U.S.!” he tweeted Tuesday afternoon. Yet it’s unclear just how many jobs are actually being saved or created as a result of Trump’s push or whether his administration will hold companies accountable for their pledges. In a solid job market with just 4.7 percent unemployment, hundreds of thousands of U.S. jobs are added all the time for a broad range of reasons. Trump has boasted that he deserves the credit based on what chief executives have told him, despite evidence to the contrary provided by those same companies. “Ask top CEO’s of those companies for real facts. Came back because of me!” the then-president-elect declared on Twitter on Wednesday. GM announced Tuesday that it was creating or keeping 7,000 jobs, while Wal-Mart said it planned to hire 10,000 and support an additional 24,000 construction jobs with store openings and expansions. Those announcements followed Amazon’s commitment to add 100,000 workers through mid-2018 and a bold claim by the Chinese online retailer Alibaba that it would create 1 million U.S. jobs over the next five years. That extravagant pledge would make Alibaba alone responsible for over 10 percent of all jobs added each year — an unheard-of feat in the modern economy. Many economists say the hiring being celebrated by Trump reflects, more than anything, the health of the $18.7 trillion economy he is inheriting. “Between the election and today, unless you work on Capitol Hill in D.C., nothing fundamental has changed in the U.S. labor market,” said Andrew Chamberlain, chief economist at the jobs site Glassdoor. To these economists, the latest high-profile hiring announcements suggest that companies are capitalizing on the politically charged climate. Trump has berated companies such as Nabisco for shuttering domestic plants in order to open factories in Mexico, while celebrating companies that publicly commit to hiring in the United States. What’s more, nearly every major U.S. employer has tax and regulatory issues before the government. To that end, a sympathetic ear in the White House could be helpful. ‘Opportunism’ The heads of German chemical company Bayer and seed-and-herbicide-maker Monsanto met with Trump last week to pitch the benefits of a planned-for merger of the two companies that requires antitrust clearance. And Trump proudly tweeted reports Wednesday that Bayer would add U.S. jobs. By announcing new jobs, companies can use any existing hiring plans to ingratiate themselves with Trump by hitching their plans to his economic agenda, noted Patrick O’Keefe, director of economic research at the consultancy and accountant CohnReznick. “There is a degree of opportunism — in a positive way,” O’Keefe said. GM plans to invest $1 billion in its U.S. factories and to create or keep 7,000 jobs — moves that the company had said were being planned well before the election. Trump had drawn attention to GM this month by threatening on Twitter to tax the automaker for selling Mexican-built cars in the United States. That set up GM’s jobs announcement as a coup for Trump, even though the investment was already in the works. A GM spokesman said it was “good timing for us to share what we are doing.” Wal-Mart’s hiring similarly seems somewhat independent of Trump. The jobs stem largely from plans to open and remodel stores — work that would not be outsourced overseas. Wal-Mart is the nation’s largest private employer, with 1.5 million workers in the United States, and its hiring rate this year will be similar to prior years, said Lorenzo Lopez, a company spokesman. These announcements follow hiring plans announced by Ford and Fiat Chrysler, among others. The auto executives were willing to let Trump promote their hiring plans, even though their decisions involved other market forces, including increased demand for SUVs as gasoline prices have dropped. Market matters Hyundai said Tuesday that it plans to invest $3.1 billion by 2021 on research and development at its factories in Alabama and Georgia. Chung Jin Haeng, chief executive of the South Korean automaker, said the decision had little to do with Trump. “The U.S. market is strategically important,” he said. At the same time, Trump has also talked with companies about cutting their costs — a move that often involves slashing jobs. He met Tuesday, for example, with the CEO of Boeing, a company he had criticized in December over Twitter for the “out of control” price of two new planes for the Air Force One fleet. CEO Dennis Muilenburg said he chatted with Trump about how to lower the costs for the presidential planes as well as fighter aircraft. “I think Mr. Trump is doing a great job with engaging the business,” Muilenburg said afterward. “We’re all on the same page here.” Not all the job announcements will necessarily come to fruition. Alibaba has said it expects to add a million U.S. companies to its online retail platform in the next five years. It asserted that sales to Chinese consumers would lead each of those companies to add, on average, one job each. This would translate into an astounding 250,000 a jobs a year in an economy in which every employer, combined, added 2.2 million jobs in 2016. “It’s not rocket-science math,” said company spokesman Brion Tingler, who nevertheless cautioned that the 1 million jobs being publicized were an “aspiration.” Other than his social media megaphone, Trump doesn’t appear to have the means to hold companies accountable for their jobs pledges. His transition team didn’t respond to questions about how it planned to ensure that CEOs’ promises to create U.S. jobs were fulfilled.

How much: $22-$58 for previews, $30-$84 for regular performances Call: 714-708-5555 Online: scr.org With the vast ocean as a setting, a colossal whale as a character and more than 130 chapters to the storyline, it is a risky venture to adapt Herman Melville’s infamously long novel “Moby-Dick; or, The Whale” to the stage. But much like hunting for a solo creature in the sea, director David Catlin looks to achieve the impossible. “I was drawn to this story on so many levels, but the challenges it entails made me want to adapt it even more,” Catlin said. “How do you put something this large onstage? The sensation of drowning, and bounding across billows on a ship; the theater is the only place where you could do that, and that challenge became a thrill.” Produced by Chicago’s Lookingglass Theatre Company, the stage adaptation of the 1851 American novel is presented at South Coast Repertory through Feb. 19. The Tony Award-winning company is known for its use of acrobatics and harnesses. The cast of “Moby Dick” will include circus-trained artists and aerialists, making the story come to life both onstage and in the air. The flying and acrobatics help to accommodate the massive storytelling the large production demands, said Catlin. The stage is framed by arches that suggest the curved ribs of a whale or the hold of a ship, and the floor and rafters are filled with interlocking ropes, cables and wires, with blue silk that represents the water. “We took advantage to choreograph from the traditional stage into the air in the vertical space, to create a sense of being under the water,” said Catlin. “We wanted a sense of boats rocking through space or sailors being pulled down by mermaids to their doom, and we’ve been able to do that with the ropes and the rigging that we have.” Melville’s story tells the tragic and – at times – comedic tale of the madman Captain Ahab and his crew, who embark on a vengeful search for a white whale. The story is narrated by the character Ishmael, who joins the crew aboard the Pequod whaling ship. The cast includes Kelley Abell, Jamie Abelson, Walter Owen Briggs, Cordelia Dewdney, Christopher Donahue, Micah Figueroa, Anthony Fleming III, Kasey Foster, Raymond Fox and Javen Ulambayar. All the actors make their SCR debut with this production. Catlin said the cast does a brilliant job of not only depicting the larger-than-life characters, but using stage tools to create the illusion of the story’s elements, including the ocean and the ships. As for the iconic whale, Catlin said he does not want to reveal exactly how Moby Dick is portrayed, but he hopes the audience will appreciate the symbolic representation of it, which includes the book’s theme of fate. “It is a bit of a surprise, but through movements, sound effects and choreography, we create the whale,” said Catlin, “There is a stagecraft to give the audience a sense of what the crew felt like. … There is even a moment when Moby Dick breaches over our heads, then disappears into the water.” Catlin’s inspiration behind adapting the novel came from a collaboration he had in 2011 with two Chicago-based theaters: Blair Thomas and Company, which uses puppetry in its productions, and The House Theatre of Chicago. After Thomas received a grant from the Boeing Co., the three theater companies began the collaboration. “We would meet at this little pie shop in Chicago five to six weeks, eat pie, discuss the book, pollinate energy and exchange ideas to create three distinct productions,” said Catlin. “Shawn Pfautsch of the House Theater in Chicago did a modern telling of the story, while Blair did a puppetry production, and we brought ours in the air.” Catlin said it felt like it took longer to adapt the novel than it took Melville to write it, because he meticulously read through and chose the excerpts he felt were most vital for theater. The dialogue is inspired by Melville but rewritten for the stage as well. The production also features music, with songs that score the action and the actors singing some of the dialogue to express their emotions. Catlin said he hopes fans of the novel will appreciate his interpretation of Melville’s words. “I will take pieces from the descriptions of the sea from one chapter and reorder to another chapter. There may be some purists that cringe, but I hope they see it more as a dramatic medium rather than a literary one; there’s a little transformation that must happen to give it dramatic integrity.” Though the story is known for its heavy themes such as fate and free will, life and death, heaven and hell, Catlin said, he hopes the audience will also see the lightheartedness behind it as well. “When we think of ‘Moby Dick,’ we often think of the book we didn’t want to read in school, but it’s actually very funny and thought-provoking,” said Catlin. “Bringing it to theater is really a communal experience, where we can create the impossible.” Contact the writer: jmoe@scng.com Digital & Driveway Delivery - 50% Off Most Popular Why Heather Dubrow is leaving 'Real Housewives of Orange County' After 25 years at MainPlace, Olive Garden plans to close and relocate Man stabbed multiple times at Lake Forest apartment complex; suspect at large How Big 5 Sporting Goods is succeeding where other sporting goods stores have failed Drought no more?

"The...pro-business tripod are potent as we hit the heart of earnings season. But so are actual numbers. Be ready for real opportunities next week," the "Mad Money" host said, referring to President Donald Trump's platform of deregulation, repatriation of money overseas and lower corporate taxes. Cramer believes those elements will be good for the stock market in the long-run. With this in mind, he outlined the stocks on his radar next week. Getty Images A man named Ben, who chose not to give his last name, dressed as the McDonald's mascot Ronald McDonald, participates in a protest for higher wages for fast food workers in New York City. Monday: Halliburton, McDonald's Halliburton: As a classic Trump stock, this oil service company is primed for Trump's presidency. However, Cramer warned that it could report a less-than-perfect quarter. McDonald's: With a huge foreign business, Cramer fears that McDonald's could be impacted negatively by Trump's pro-growth policies that will strengthen the dollar. That means earnings estimates may need to come down. If CEO Steve Easterbrook focuses on technology, loyalty and luring in customers, Wall Street's reaction could be OK. Tuesday: 3M, Lockheed Martin 3M: Voted by Cramer as one of the stocks that could help the Dow reach 20,000, he recommended buying shares both before and after it reports. Lockheed Martin: Cramer is interested in seeing if Lockheed will trim its forecast because of the price cut to the joint strike fighter, which was done to concede with Trump's wishes. If it doesn't guide down, Cramer said the stock could fly high. Wednesday: Norfolk Southern, Boeing, Freeport-McMoRan Norfolk Southern: With the stock performing strongly, Cramer wants to be careful going into the quarter. When stocks run up into earnings, it is very difficult for them to rally afterwards, even if they deliver terrific numbers. He suggested selling the stock beforehand. Freeport-McMoRan: Copper, gold and oil play Freeport could benefit from acceleration in the global economy. This stock has also run up dramatically, but Cramer blessed it for buying if you believe that both America and China are headed higher. Thursday: Caterpillar, Alphabet Caterpillar: Deemed one of the infrastructure plays that will last through the early days of Trump's administration, Cramer warned that Caterpillar has been hurt by the strong dollar. If Trump picks a bone with the Chinese on trade, it could be a double-whammy. With so many cross-currents, he didn't recommend it. Alphabet: Cramer called this one controversial because it needs to rein in costs from other bets, or find a way to generate accelerated revenue. It could also be a winner in Trump's administration because it has lots of cash overseas. "I would buy Alphabet aggressively if the stock comes down after the quarter precisely because of that cash hoard's possibilities," Cramer said. Friday: Honeywell With Dave Cote as the outgoing CEO, Cramer thinks he will want to go out on a high.

The Space Based Infrared System Geosynchronous satellite, or SBIRS GEO 3, will launch between 7:42-8:22 p.m. EST Friday from the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Florida. An Atlas 5 rocket of the United Launch Alliance (ULA), named AV-066, will put the satellite in a geosynchronous orbit from where, according to manufacturer Lockheed Martin, it will use infrared surveillance to support the military in four ways — missile defense, missile warning, battlespace awareness and technical intelligence. The launch was previously scheduled for the evening of Jan. 19, but was postponed “due to a violation of Eastern Range safety criteria,” ULA said. The company will start a live broadcast of the launch at 7:22 p.m. EST, 20 minutes before the launch window opens. It will be the first of 11 planned launches for the company in 2017.

It had been scheduled to be completed by July. But she said flight training for the first 10 pilots is still on track to start on Aug. 1. The California-based company has said it plans to eventually train 150 to 200 pilots a year in Owensboro. Li said the trainees, primarily from China, will also take classes at Kentucky Wesleyan College. They are already submitting applications, she said. The problem with starting construction, Li said, is that the site the company had selected doesn't have a public ramp and Apus would have to add building a ramp to its costs. "Public ramp space is still available," she said. "We're going to spend a couple of years to find the right place for our facility." Li said no facility currently at the airport will "hold what we plan." For the time being, she said, "We'll renovate an existing facility or build something small." Bob Whitmer, airport manager, said, "I am confident we can find a place for them on the airport." The Kentucky Economic Development Finance Authority approved $320,000 in incentives last year to help persuade Apus to locate here. Why train Chinese pilots in Owensboro rather than in China? AirSpaceMag.com last year wrote, "The big advantage of learning abroad is English-language immersion. Aviation, even in China, is a business conducted in English." The site said that China "will support as many as 100 airlines in the next few decades, according to Chinese media. Yet Boeing recently estimated that within 20 years, China will have a shortfall of 77,400 commercial pilots." The story added, "The country's regional airlines are recruiting foreign pilots. Shenzhen Airlines recently advertised for a captain's position paying an annual salary of $212,000. The country's 12 civilian aviation academies are operating at full capacity and can turn out only 1,200 to 1,400 certified commercial pilots per year." And it said, "Chinese airlines spend the equivalent of $162 million annually to send 80 percent of the student pilot candidates abroad -- about 2,000 to the United States, the others to Europe and Australia."

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it By Danielle Paquette By Danielle Paquette January 20 Follow @dpaqreport Matt Gane hangs out on the Mall in Washington with his dad, Ed Gane. (Photo by Danielle Paquette) Three times, President Trump mentioned the factories. Each time, Matt Gane clapped, feeling as though the country’s new leader was talking about his hometown. Gane, 17, had taken a bus from Delaware County, Pa., to watch Trump assume the presidency. He stood with his father, Ed, who drafts layouts on contract for local plants, near the back of the Mall, where the distant Capitol looked like a dollhouse. “One by one, the factories shuttered and left our shores,” Trump declared above them on a jumbo screen. “Not even a thought about the millions and millions of American workers that were left behind.” Gane was too young to vote in November, but he supported the businessman, who complained about the economy just like his dad. On Friday, he wore a blue “Trump for President” hoodie and snapped iPhone photos of the jumbo Trump. Raindrops flecked his square-rimmed glasses. “Politicians prospered, but the jobs left and the factories closed,” Trump told the crowd. “The establishment protected itself, but not the citizens of our country.” “Woo!” Gane shouted. He will graduate next year from high school in Aston Township, Pa. He has considered becoming a nurse, like his mother, or a teacher. He finds his dad’s job interesting, too. “If [Trump] does what he promised,” Gane said, “if he brings back the jobs, there are going to be plenty of opportunities." Since 2001, Delaware County has lost about a third of its manufacturing jobs, dropping from 20,807 to 14,701. Over the past five years, a Boeing rotorcraft factory, one of the area’s largest employers, has cut its staff from  6,200 to 4,650. Gane’s historically blue county backed Hillary Clinton, though less enthusiastically than it voted for former president Barack Obama. Ed Gane, 59, said that’s probably because the future seemed bleak. One of his employers recently slashed about a third of its staff. He hopes Trump will follow through on his promise to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement, which he believes sparked an exodus of jobs from the United States.  “Where I’m from, we see kids get engineering degrees and then end up working at a McDonald’s,” he said. “If you don’t have manufacturing, you don’t need engineers.” Roughly 5 million U.S. manufacturing jobs have vanished over the past two decades, and economists ascribe the shrinkage to a blend of trade and technology. The debate continues over which force was worse for employment, but a recent study from Indiana’s Ball State University found labor-reducing machinery has quashed more jobs, since factories can now produce more goods with fewer people. Trump hasn’t addressed this aspect of automation, but he has threatened to slap tariffs on goods, particularly vehicles, created outside the county and sold on U.S. soil. Such measures, analysts say, would be tough to pass through Republican lawmakers. States in the Rust Belt, such as Pennsylvania, bore much of the nation’s manufacturing job loss and unexpectedly pushed Trump to victory. He described the landscape Friday in his speech: “Rusted out factories scattered like tombstones across the landscape of our nation.”     business wonkblog true Please provide a valid email address.

Fred Katayama reports. ▲ Hide Transcript ▶ View Transcript President Donald Trump walked away from his campaign vow of naming China a currency manipulator on his first day in office. But his phone chat with Taiwan's president and his threats to slap high tariffs on Chinese goods have ratcheted up tensions with the world's second largest economy. China has threatened to "take off the gloves." Leland Miller of China Beige Book sees one of two scenarios under Trump: strong U.S. growth or a trade war with China that could dent that growth: SOUNDBITE: LELAND MILLER, PRESIDENT ,CHINA BEIGE BOOK, (ENGLISH) SAYING: "You have some of these threats Trump wielded during the campaign about tariffs and other things - if that takes precedence, then you're going to have a much worse situation. So it's the clash between what should be a very pro-growth agenda for this very first year with this shadow of trade warfare hanging over it, and it just depends on which direction the president wants to lead us." The wild card, according to Miller: the hard line economist Peter Navarro, whom Trump has named to head the newly formed White House National Trade Council. He wrote the book and directed the documentary, "Death by China." Miller says it's unclear what Navarro will do and how much power his council will have. Should a trade war break out, U.S. exporters will be among the most vulnerable. Milken Institute Asia Fellow Curtis Chin was formerly the U.S. ambassador to the Asian Development Bank. SOUNDBITE: CURTIS CHIN, ASIA FELLOW, MILKEN INSTITUTE, (ENGLISH) SAYING: "Airplanes. Boeing front and center. China, Chinese airlines are big customers of Boeing. But also, the United States is the biggest agricultural exporter in the world. China buys a lot of those exports." China's own exports fell for the second straight year, And with other signs that its economy is slowing, China watchers say U.S. relations with China could become more volatile than they think.

The Cedar Rapids, Iowa-based company is bidding on more defense program contracts "and the scope of the programs is larger," Ortberg said on a conference call with analysts after Rockwell reported a 10 percent rise in its quarterly profit. U.S. defense spending had been slowed by a temporary budget agreement, known as a continuing resolution, that keeps current spending levels in place, Ortberg said. He warned that another continuing resolution "would eat into" Rockwell's 2017 revenue forecast, but said he expects a new budget deal would be reached soon. Rockwell downplayed a planned cut in output of Boeing Co 777 jetliners, saying the 40 percent reduction this year would have minimal effect on earnings. "It did come a little earlier than we expected," Ortberg said, "but it's not overly material." Rockwell's shares were up 2.3 percent at $91.23 in late afternoon trading. Rockwell reported a profit of $1.10 a share for the fiscal first quarter ended Dec. 31. That was below the $1.14 a share that analysts on average had expected, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The figure included costs from Rockwell's acquisition of seat maker B/E Aerospace Inc , which Rockwell said would close in the spring. Excluding acquisition costs, the company earned $1.20 a share, up 17 percent from a year ago.

How to know how much risk you can stand By Alessandra Malito Published: Jan 21, 2017 11:33 a.m. ET Share The market will inevitably go up and down, but are you ready for the latter? AFP/Getty Images The market will go up, but are you prepared for when it also goes down? By AlessandraMalito Reporter The end of the contentious presidential election between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton led to a rallying stock market. Will the market continue to cheer on the political neophyte Trump, or will it make an ugly turn? One thing history has shown is that occasionally the stock market faces a downturn, and it likely will again. That’s why experts suggest assessing how much risk there is in your retirement portfolio (usually equities will be the riskiest) and determining how much money you’re willing to expose to the market’s vicissitudes. “We as investors are trying to achieve some sort of balance that allows us to sleep at night,” said Curt Weil, a semi-retired financial planner in Palo Alto, Calif. who does mostly pro-bono work now. Stock indexes reached all-new highs after the presidential election, and a few times the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.04% which is up 7.97% since Election Day, almost broke the psychological barrier of 20,000, which would have been a new milestone. And some experts expect stocks to rise this year. See: The biggest risk to your investment portfolio? Not Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump There are two ways to look at risk: the individual’s ability to take risk, such as the funds available to invest, and his or her willingness to do so, said Ed Robinson, co-founder of New York-based robo-adviser Stash. Will augmented reality or virtual reality win?(3:11) Augmented and virtual reality are growing into multi-billion-dollar businesses that will transform how users shop, work and communicate. Intel, HTC, Lenovo and Alphabet showed their latest innovations at CES in Las Vegas. But sometimes a person’s gut instinct isn’t aligned with what might be best for him. Millennials are a great example of this, and Kendrick Wakeman, chief executive officer of investment analytics and risk tolerance company FinMason, said he often sees this younger generation not taking enough “risks” with their investments, in this case the amount of their portfolios exposed to the potential ups and downs of the market. Millennials are not always big financial risk takers — possibly because their closest reference to a downturn was the 2007 financial crisis — even though experts say they should be since they have time on their side. For example, millennials held twice as much cash as baby boomers did, according to a survey from the wealth management arm of Swiss-based financial services company UBS. Don’t miss: My dad talked me out of the decade’s best investment, but he wasn’t wrong Here’s what you can do about the risk in your retirement portfolio: Know how much the professionals think you should be risking To know how much risk you should be taking, consider the purpose of the investments, experts said. Doing so can provide balance between what risk you feel comfortable taking and what risk you need to meet those goals. “If you have a low emotional tolerance to risk and a high financial tolerance, you might not hit your goals,” Wakeman said. On the other hand, it might be a bad idea for investors to be too aggressive with their investments if they have little disposable cash to fund those accounts, or the goals are short-term. One way to determine your asset allocation is to subtract your age from 100 and invest that percentage in bonds, but Henry K. Hebeler, a retired Boeing Company executive who now does retirement planning, wrote in a column he subtracts the age by 105. With people living a lot longer these days, a portfolio shouldn’t cease to have risk once someone becomes of retirement age, Weil said. In order to keep money coming in to meet your still long-term goals, equities will need to be a part of the equation. See also: 10 questions to help measure the risk in your portfolio Find the right balance, for you To keep emotions in check, determine beforehand how much you’re comfortable losing and see how much your portfolio is currently at risk to lose, usually by viewing a breakdown of your investments, Wakeman said. Understanding what’s inside your portfolio is fundamental to ensuring you’re properly invested in risk, though more than 40% of Americans don’t know how their accounts are allocated. It’s important to know your own personality. If you won’t be able to sleep at night if the market is down, a lot of exposure to the market probably isn’t right for you. To combat strong fears, consider the benefits of the risk allocation you’ve chosen, such as the upswing you might see when the market comes back, Wakeman said. Have a plan, and when things get bad, look at it Often times, people feel a lot differently when they’re sitting down assessing how much they’re comfortable risking than when they’re actually seeing their accounts in the red on the day of a downturn — this is why advisers sometimes refrain from risk tolerance questionnaires, which ask clients how they feel about what they can lose. Once you have a plan in place for your retirement assets, and how much risk you can handle, advisers suggest taking that plan out on bad market days to avoid any unnecessary actions, such as selling it all away. “The easiest way to stay on track is to remember you have a plan you’re executing,” said Brian Ullman, an adviser with Fresno, Calif.-based financial advisory firm Ford Financial Group. You’re not day trading your 401(k) or individual retirement account, he said. More from MarketWatch Trump inauguration set to unleash cascade of stock-market anxiety Have no money to invest?

How to know how much risk you can stand By Alessandra Malito Published: Jan 21, 2017 11:33 a.m. ET Share The market will inevitably go up and down, but are you ready for the latter? AFP/Getty Images The market will go up, but are you prepared for when it also goes down? By AlessandraMalito Reporter The end of the contentious presidential election between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton led to a rallying stock market. Will the market continue to cheer on the political neophyte Trump, or will it make an ugly turn? One thing history has shown is that occasionally the stock market faces a downturn, and it likely will again. That’s why experts suggest assessing how much risk there is in your retirement portfolio (usually equities will be the riskiest) and determining how much money you’re willing to expose to the market’s vicissitudes. “We as investors are trying to achieve some sort of balance that allows us to sleep at night,” said Curt Weil, a semi-retired financial planner in Palo Alto, Calif. who does mostly pro-bono work now. Stock indexes reached all-new highs after the presidential election, and a few times the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.04% which is up 7.97% since Election Day, almost broke the psychological barrier of 20,000, which would have been a new milestone. And some experts expect stocks to rise this year. See: The biggest risk to your investment portfolio? Not Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump There are two ways to look at risk: the individual’s ability to take risk, such as the funds available to invest, and his or her willingness to do so, said Ed Robinson, co-founder of New York-based robo-adviser Stash. Will augmented reality or virtual reality win?(3:11) Augmented and virtual reality are growing into multi-billion-dollar businesses that will transform how users shop, work and communicate. Intel, HTC, Lenovo and Alphabet showed their latest innovations at CES in Las Vegas. But sometimes a person’s gut instinct isn’t aligned with what might be best for him. Millennials are a great example of this, and Kendrick Wakeman, chief executive officer of investment analytics and risk tolerance company FinMason, said he often sees this younger generation not taking enough “risks” with their investments, in this case the amount of their portfolios exposed to the potential ups and downs of the market. Millennials are not always big financial risk takers — possibly because their closest reference to a downturn was the 2007 financial crisis — even though experts say they should be since they have time on their side. For example, millennials held twice as much cash as baby boomers did, according to a survey from the wealth management arm of Swiss-based financial services company UBS. Don’t miss: My dad talked me out of the decade’s best investment, but he wasn’t wrong Here’s what you can do about the risk in your retirement portfolio: Know how much the professionals think you should be risking To know how much risk you should be taking, consider the purpose of the investments, experts said. Doing so can provide balance between what risk you feel comfortable taking and what risk you need to meet those goals. “If you have a low emotional tolerance to risk and a high financial tolerance, you might not hit your goals,” Wakeman said. On the other hand, it might be a bad idea for investors to be too aggressive with their investments if they have little disposable cash to fund those accounts, or the goals are short-term. One way to determine your asset allocation is to subtract your age from 100 and invest that percentage in bonds, but Henry K. Hebeler, a retired Boeing Company executive who now does retirement planning, wrote in a column he subtracts the age by 105. With people living a lot longer these days, a portfolio shouldn’t cease to have risk once someone becomes of retirement age, Weil said. In order to keep money coming in to meet your still long-term goals, equities will need to be a part of the equation. See also: 10 questions to help measure the risk in your portfolio Find the right balance, for you To keep emotions in check, determine beforehand how much you’re comfortable losing and see how much your portfolio is currently at risk to lose, usually by viewing a breakdown of your investments, Wakeman said. Understanding what’s inside your portfolio is fundamental to ensuring you’re properly invested in risk, though more than 40% of Americans don’t know how their accounts are allocated. It’s important to know your own personality. If you won’t be able to sleep at night if the market is down, a lot of exposure to the market probably isn’t right for you. To combat strong fears, consider the benefits of the risk allocation you’ve chosen, such as the upswing you might see when the market comes back, Wakeman said. Have a plan, and when things get bad, look at it Often times, people feel a lot differently when they’re sitting down assessing how much they’re comfortable risking than when they’re actually seeing their accounts in the red on the day of a downturn — this is why advisers sometimes refrain from risk tolerance questionnaires, which ask clients how they feel about what they can lose. Once you have a plan in place for your retirement assets, and how much risk you can handle, advisers suggest taking that plan out on bad market days to avoid any unnecessary actions, such as selling it all away. “The easiest way to stay on track is to remember you have a plan you’re executing,” said Brian Ullman, an adviser with Fresno, Calif.-based financial advisory firm Ford Financial Group. You’re not day trading your 401(k) or individual retirement account, he said. More from MarketWatch Trump inauguration set to unleash cascade of stock-market anxiety Have no money to invest?

Metzler, UNITED NATIONS  January 21, 2017, 12:02 am TWN SHARE CLOSE Blogger   Google+ Live Journal   Plurk Stumble Upon     Tweet A- A+ Chaos, conflict and crisis are some of the words that best describe the combustible global situation that new U.S. President Donald J. Trump inherits from his predecessor. Far from a stable world order, Donald Trump is entering a complex foreign maze in which he must decipher, decode and often defuse a feckless and lamentable foreign policy legacy from Cuba to China. Let's take a look at the international situation Donald Trump faces. China On Barack Obama's watch China's trade deficit with the U.S. ballooned, hitting an all-time high of US$367 billion in 2015. More ominously, Beijing is expanding its geopolitical reach into the international waters of the South China Sea, through building artificial islands and platforms in disputed reefs. Despite the conflicting claims of six other states, Beijing provocatively claims the South China Sea as a kind of exclusive "Mare Nostrum" Our Sea. While American rhetoric has stressed the right of free navigation in international waters, Washington's words and a downsized U.S. Navy have not stopped China's deeds. Obama's vaunted pivot to Asia was another style-over-substance policy. North Korea North Korea's nuclear threat has expanded. Pyongyang has perfected working nuclear weapons during Obama's administration. There have been five nuclear tests and the regime is working on long-range missile technology, targeting Japan and ultimately the U.S. This could be a first test for Trump. Don't take the bait. The Middle East Obama inherited a dangerous but stabilized Iraq. After much American blood and treasure spent toppling Saddam's dictatorship, Iraq was reasonably secure. Obama's precipitous troop pullout caused the string in the national fabric to unravel reopening the sectarian divide. After losing huge swaths of land and cities to the Islamic State (IS), described by Obama as a "junior varsity" terrorist group, only now has Baghdad begun to regain its footing. Slowly they are reclaiming lost land from IS with the help of 5,000 U.S. troops. Iran Despite the Islamic Republic of Iran being a clear and present danger to regional stability, especially Saudi Arabia and Israel, the Obama team brokered a multilateral diplomatic deal with Russia, China, France, Germany and the U.K. to presumably defuse Iran's embryonic nuclear capacity. While the "deal" as Secretary of State Kerry proudly describes it, has frozen Tehran's nuclear weapons program, not all countries are quite so sanguine. In the meantime, Obama released hundreds of millions of Iranian frozen financial assets and helped Boeing aircraft win contracts to sell Iran Air late model American civilian airliners and technology. Syria Poor Syria; 500,000 dead, over 10 million people internally displaced or turned into refugees. The so-called Arab Spring began with democratic intentions but soon turned into a bloody sectarian winter. An American seesaw policy of tough words and empty actions toward Syria's dictatorship enflamed a regional conflict and eventually invited bloody backdoor Russian involvement. There are many more Middle East disasters from Western intervention, such as in Libya (the country is now a chaotic gaggle of warlords and terrorist clans) and Yemen (once Obama's poster child in the region and now torn asunder by rival Saudi and Iranian backed factions). Once-close American relations with Israel are tragically frayed. 1|2|Next Page>> SHARE CLOSE Blogger Google+ Live Journal Plurk Stumble Upon   Tweet PREVIOUS ARTICLE President leaves behind legacy of intellect and grace NEXT ARTICLE What new US leader must know Write a Comment Terms Enter your comments - 3000 characters max Type in image code  Receive our promos  Respond to this email Submit MOST POPULAR OF THIS SECTION 1 A post-truth world makes us get personal about the meaning of honesty 2 US stands alone in S.

The deal will come after Iran, which had not directly purchased a Western-built plane in nearly 40 years, signed contracts with Europe's Airbus (AIR.PA) and U.S. rival Boeing (BA.N) last year to purchase about 180 jets. That became possible after an agreement between Iran and six major powers lifted most international sanctions imposed on Tehran, in exchange for Iran curbing its nuclear program. "We have concluded the negotiations and we should sign the contract imminently," ATR Chief Executive Christian Scherer said. Scherer was responding to some Iranian media reports on Friday that ATR had already announced the signature of the keenly awaited deal.   Iranian officials said in December that a deal for 20 twin-engine turboprop ATR 72-600 aircraft was close. IranAir and ATR have spent months negotiating a firm order for 20 ATR 72-600 aircraft worth 540 million euros ($576 million) at list prices, with options for another 20. All three manufacturers have received U.S. Treasury export licenses to sell to Iran, a step required even for European firms since all modern Western aircraft rely on many U.S. parts.     Even so, industry sources say all three may need further approvals or extended cover in order to complete deliveries.      That is likely to re-focus industry attention on the direction taken by U.S. President Donald Trump, who has voiced opposition to the nuclear sanctions deal.

That will be the first full day of global trading and the chance for investors in Asia and Europe to place their bets. Or remain on the sidelines. There's a curious dichotomy across markets: some assets are vulnerable to a potentially major positioning shakeout (U.S. Treasuries and the dollar) while many investors say they are playing safe, broadly neutral, and firmly on the sidelines. Inauguration day is generally a bad one for Wall Street. So is the first month under a new president. The dollar, on the other hand, usually fares better in the first month. History is often a good guide to the future. But if any president looks like he might break the mould, it's Trump. * History suggests Trump month will be stocks down, dollar up * For stock performance under Trump, don't look to prior transitions * Investors curb their enthusiasm ahead of Trump era * Graphic: One month in: http://reut.rs/2j1xrmu * Graphic: The Presidential Touch: http://tmsnrt.rs/2jtEpzi 2/ JUDGMENT DAY Prime Minister Theresa May cheered many investors when, even as she said Britain would leave the single markets on its exit from the European Union, she promised parliament would have a vote on the final deal. Largely in response, the pound had its best day against the dollar since at least 1998. The next set-piece in the Brexit saga comes on Tuesday when the Supreme Court will rule on whether May can trigger the formal beginning of two years of exit talks without parliamentary assent. There could be another wrinkle in the planned Brexit timetable - the court may rule that devolved assemblies in Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales must also give their approval. Northern Ireland faces an election on March 2 and this could be followed by lengthy talks on power-sharing. * Supreme Court says it will give Brexit trigger case ruling on Tuesday * Brexit outline gives pound something to cling to - for now * UK retail sales dive as inflation weighs, jolting sterling * UK Q4 GDP data due Jan. 26 3/ AND IN ROME Italy's Constitutional Court also meets on Tuesday for a hearing on the legitimacy of a new electoral law. It's not clear whether there will be a definitive ruling on the disputed law, which only relates to the lower house of parliament and is known as the Italicum. The case has major implications for when elections might next be held and so is a key risk event for markets. A referendum, rejected by voters on Dec. 4, would have eliminated Italy's upper house, the Senate, which has a proportional voting system, while a first-past-the-post law was approved for the lower house in 2015. It's this lower house law that is being challenged in the court. Italy's usually tight-lipped president has said Italy must adopt a new electoral law before a national vote can be called -- something many party leaders urged after last month's referendum forced Matteo Renzi to step down as premier. Just as Italian markets weathered one storm in the form of a DBRS ratings downgrade, another one appears to be brewing. * Monte Paschi retail bondholders should be reimbursed- regulator * Italy not worried about ECB ending asset-buying- Econ Minister * EU asks Italy to cut back 2017 budget deficit * DBRS cuts Italy's credit rating, posing problem for banks 4/ SHOW ME THE MONEY Expectations are running high for the European earnings season. The mood among analysts, measured as the number of earnings upgrades against the number of downgrades, is the brightest since 2010. While the pace of European company results will pick up only later in January and through next month, there are a few big ones expected next week and numbers will be scoured for insights into everything from auto demand to luxury spending to the health of banks in Spain's recovering economy. Fiat, LVMH, Sky, Novartis, SAP, Philips, Santander are the major companies scheduled to report. * Europe corporate earnings: SAP, IG, Phillips earnings Jan. 24; Novartis, Santander, Logitech Jan. 25; Nordea, Sky, Diageo, LVMH, Tele2, Unilever, STMicro, Bankinter Jan. 26; UBS, Banco de Sabadell, Telia, BT, CNH Jan. 27 * U.S. corporate events: Halliburton, Yahoo, McDonalds Jan. 23; Verizoen, Lockheed Martin, Travelers, Corning, Kimberly Clark Jan. 24; State Street, Boeing, McCormick Jan. 25;Caterpillar, Ford, Microsoft, Intel, Alphabet, Dow Chemical, Biogen, Starbucks, Eastman, Invesco, Bristol Myers Squibb, PaypalJan.26;Chevron, Colgate Palmolive, Honeywell, Whirlpool, AbbVie, General Dynamics, American AirlinesJan. 27 5/ TURKEY TALKS RATES Turkey's central bank meets on Tuesday, with many investors calling for a hefty rise in interest rates to stem the lira's freefall and to demonstrate the bank's independence. Fifteen of 18 economists polled by Reuters expect higher rates, with a 50 basis point hike in the 8.0 percent one-week repo rate seen as the most likely outcome. Four expect a 100 bps rise. Some analysts, however, say this may not be enough to anchor the currency. Investors say they have been unnerved by the crackdown that followed a failed coup in July. But their biggest concern appears to be the stance on monetary policy of President Tayyip Erdogan, who has declared himself an "enemy" of interest rates. Demand for a 10-year Turkish eurobond in the past week was strong but it had to offer a yield of 6.15 percent, up from 5 percent at a similar sale last March. * As investors seek hefty rate hike, credibility test looms for Turkey central bank * Turkey borrows $2 billion in 10-year eurobond issue (Compiled by Nigel Stephenson; editing by John Stonestreet) Share or comment on this article e-mail Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.

There are a myriad of missions already in the history books, and many more underway. We’re at a pivotal time in our exploration of space. With a bit of luck and science, we may soon be able to explore more freely and understand the nature of the universe — it’s a bright future. These are six of the most important upcoming missions that will get us there. Mars 2020 rover The Curiosity rover has been a huge success. After landing on mars in 2012, the rover has lasted much longer than the original design life, and has traveled farther on mars than any robot before it. The next step is the as-yet unnamed Mars 2020 rover. As the placeholder name implies, NASA wants to launch this mission in 2020. The rover will be based on the incredibly successful design of Curiosity, but the instruments it takes along for the ride will be vastly improved. The Mars 2020 rover will be equipped to investigate the geology of Mars with an eye toward detecting the signs of past (or present) life on the Red Planet. It will use Raman Spectroscopy and x-ray lithochemistry to identify elemental components and organic materials on Mars with much more sensitivity than Curiosity can. It may also carry an experiment to produce breathable oxygen from Mars’ predominantly carbon dioxide atmosphere. This could have major implications for future manned missions. James Webb Space Telescope launch We’ve been talking a lot about the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) lately — NASA has completed construction of the hardware, and is currently testing it on the ground. It has also asked astronomers to begin submitting proposals for time on the telescope after it’s online. This telescope will be much more powerful the Hubble, which has a mere 48 square feet of reflective surface compared with JWST’s 270 square feet. The James Webb Space Telescope will be able to seem further into the infrared than Hubble, meaning it can study objects that are obscured by dust or gas. In order to avoid avoid contaminating heat, the telescope will be placed in the L2 Lagrange point with the Earth permanently between the telescope and the sun. The launch is currently on track for October of 2018. New Horizons Kuiper Belt Extended Mission NASA’s New Horizons mission was big news in 2015 when it reached Pluto after nearly a decade in space. It’s not over for the plucky little probe—NASA has added a Kuiper Belt Extended Mission (KEM) to the schedule. The plan is to send New Horizons onward into the Kuiper Belt to examine these frigid balls of rock and ice. New Horizons will make a flyby of an object known as 2014 MU69 on January 1st 2019. This object is 20 or 25 miles in diameter and has an unknown composition. This will be the first time we’ve gotten a close-up look at a Kuiper Belt object (other than Pluto). Their similarities or differences could tell us a great deal. ExoMars, part 2 Okay, the first part of ExoMars (a joint effort of the ESA and Russia’s Roscosmos) didn’t go super-well when the stationary Schiaparelli lander delivered by the Trace Gas Orbiter crashed into the surface. The second phase of ExoMars is set to launch in 2020, and hopefully it goes better. This will include a new surface platform and a rover. The new ExoMars surface station will be used to monitor the planet’s orbit and atmospheric variables over the course of a year. Meanwhile, the rover will have an advanced exobiology module to search for signs of life. A core drill will also allow the rover to dig deep into the surface to obtain its samples. The ESA and Roscosmos expect the landing to take place in 2021. SpaceX Dragon 2 crewed flight SpaceX is one of two companies currently participating in NASA’s Commercial Crew Program, the other being Boeing. There’s nothing wrong with Boeing’s plans, but SpaceX has a lot more interesting new technology in the crewed version of the Dragon capsule. Like the current cargo Dragon, the Dragon 2 capsule will be launched by a Falcon 9 rocket that can land back on Earth after sending the second stage into space. Dragon 2 will have space for seven astronauts, and NASA has already contracted for six crewed flights to the ISS. The next few years will include milestones for the Dragon 2 — the one to watch is in May of 2018. That’s when the Dragon 2 will ferry two astronauts up to the ISS, marking the first time humans have ridden an American spacecraft since the Space Shuttle was retired. Asteroid Redirect Robotic Mission (ARRM) There are thousands of near-Earth asteroids, and we can only learn so much about these objects from robotic exploration. Sending people to an asteroid is still outside our capabilities, but maybe we can bring part of one here. NASA’s JPL is working on a plan to visit a nearby asteroid with a probe, and bring a piece of it back. The Asteroid Redirect Robotic Mission (ARRM) is currently planned for a 2021 launch, but there’s still a lot of planning that needs to be done. The probe would land on an asteroid like 2008 EV5 and pick up a 4-meter boulder. The mission could also include an analysis of gravity deflection — testing to see if the mass of the probe and boulder can affect the orbit of the asteroid. The boulder would pose no danger to Earth if it were to get away on the return trip. The idea is that it could be deposited in orbit of the moon and astronauts could visit it at a later date in the mid 2020s. Now read: What is the Fermi Paradox?

Business It’s Not Just Your Phone: Trump Tweets Are Now All Over $25,000 Bloomberg Terminals When the President-elect shares his feelings about the latest SNL episode, they quickly ricochet through the operating system of the financial industry. Matthew Zeitlin BuzzFeed News Reporter On a Monday afternoon a few weeks ago, Donald Trump was moved to discuss where Toyota builds its cars. Toyota Motor said will build a new plant in Baja, Mexico, to build Corolla cars for U.S. NO WAY! Build plant in U.S. or pay big border tax. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) ID: 10315321 Wall Street’s most beloved machine lit up. The Bloomberg terminal, the operating system of the financial industry, is now well-equipped to turn a Trump tweet into money. Bloomberg’s years-long partnership with Twitter means the terminals, which cost about $25,000 a year each for the company’s more than 300,000 subscribers, now come with tools to track the president-elect’s every market moving statement — and make money from them. In typical Bloomberg fashion, you can customize your alerts for Trump tweets to see only when he mentions certain companies you are following. You can see, in real time, how the things he says translate into changing public sentiment on a company, and what happens to a stock, currency, or pretty much anything else being traded on markets at the time. And with the right screening, you can filter out his furious responses to SNL episodes and many praise-retweets. View this image › BuzzFeed ID: 10315429 After that Toyota tweet in early January, Bloomberg terminals showed that as Toyota’s share price fell, the number of tweets about the company spiked, and the sentiment of the tweets turned sharply negative, according to Bloomberg’s tool for analyzing Twitter content. Toyota’s share price (grey) and tweet volume (blue) alongside Twitter sentiment (green/red) after the Trump tweet. View this image › BuzzFeed ID: 10316352 These tools are being used more and more as Trump picks the corporate winners and losers of the day. It happened to Lockheed Martin when he criticized the price of the F-35 fighter jet, and to Boeing when he declared the price of a new Air Force One too high. This stuff matters to investors — especially if they get be on the right side of the stock market moves that happen as a result. Many financial institutions forbid social media use at work, making Bloomberg terminals a lifeline for traders wanting to keep up with the President-elect. Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase traders access tweets through their Bloomberg terminals, The Wall Street Journal reported last week, while just this month, the Japanese bank Mizuho gave its U.S. traders the ability to read tweets at work. “He is publicly shaming people and companies,” Peter Tchir, a managing director at Brean Capital, said in a note. “He is trying to sway companies in a very public manner.” Investment banks now regularly rush out notes to clients based on Trump’s tweets about companies. After the President-elect tweeted about Toyota, the Japanese bank Nomura said in an note to clients that “this tweet does not mark the first time Mr Trump has intervened in a company’s plans for the construction of a plant in Mexico, and we see the possibility of continued intervention in high-profile companies’ plans for construction of Mexican plants after his inauguration.” A few days before Christmas, Trump weighed in on federal contracting, tweeting that the cost of the F-35 fighter plane was “tremendous” and that he was asking a rival defense contractor (Boeing, another past victim of a Trump-shaming) to work on a comparable plane, leading to a 2% share dip in after-market trading. Again, the Bloomberg analysis showed that tweets about Lockheed went from just a few every 20 minutes, to well over 100 — and they were mostly negative.

McIntyre January 16, 2017 6:44 am EST Print Email Tweet SpaceX two-stage Falcon rocket launched 10 satellites and then its first stage section returned to earth. At this point, it would appear the company has no worth competitors. This may not be entirely true. China’s Landspace Technology will soon launch a satellite for Danish company Gomspace. The launch will not happen until 2018, and there is no guarantee it will not explode either on the platform or in flight. The People’s Daily reports: Landspace CEO Zhang Changwu said his company could not have won recognition from the overseas client without decades of efforts by Chinese workers in the aerospace industry, which has been developing for 60 years. The total value of the global aerospace market could hit 485 billion U.S. dollars by 2020, according to market estimates, with the market value in China alone reaching 800 billion yuan (116 billion U.S. dollars) during the 2016-2020 period. If China follows earlier practices in the realm of technology, it may favor a company owned and operated by a local company. This could block SpaceX and other international satellite rocket firms from establishing a foot hold there . China is already well down the road of manned flight, another SpaceX target. The nation put two astronauts in space late last year with a Long March rocket. From there, they moved into the Tiangong-2 space station. They later returned to earth safely SpaceX is not the only U.S. company which faces competition from Landspace Technology. Boeing (NYSE: BA) and Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT) have a project which competes with SpaceX. As is true with many other products and services, China may be the largest market for everything from aircraft to electric cars. In the meantime, competition in the rocket business should be anxious about the future of Landspace Technology. I'm interested in the Newsletter Get Newsletter terms and conditions   By Douglas A.

Kyrgyzstan blames pilot error for Turkish cargo plane hitting villageMon, 16 Jan 2017 2:54 PM Share Your Email by Vyacheslav Oseledko with Tolkun Namatbayeva in Bishkek A cargo plane attempting to land in thick fog crashed Monday into a village near Kyrgyzstan's main airport and killed at least 37 people, with authorities blaming "pilot error".  A massive section of the aircraft's tail billowed smoke as rescuers searched for victims among the wreckage in the village of Dacha-Suu, home to the majority of the dead. "According to preliminary information, the plane crashed due to a pilot error," deputy prime minister Muhammetkaly Abulgaziev said at a briefing broadcast on state television. A minimum of 37 people, including the plane's four pilots, were killed in the crash and the toll may rise, said a spokesman for the country's emergency services, Muhammed Svarov.  The plane was attempting a landing at the Manas airport in the Kyrgyz capital Bishkek in thick fog.   Crushed cars, shattered homes and huge chunks of burnt debris littered the village, which was hit by the plane at around 7:30 am (0130 GMT), as many residents were still at home in bed. "Our grandson said something was burning," Tajikan, a Dacha Suu resident who identified herself only by her first name, told AFP.  "We heard a roar and (what felt) like an earthquake. Many people were sleeping, everything around was burning. One of the parts of the aircraft fell on our neighbour's house. She and her whole family died," the pensioner said.  Zumriyat Rezakhanova, another resident of Dacha-Suu, said the plane fell "right on the homes" where residents were sleeping.  "My sister's home is badly damaged. Luckily she and her family survived," Rezakhanova told AFP.  - 'Deeply saddened' - The flight was travelling from Hong Kong to Istanbul via Kyrgyzstan's capital Bishkek. ACT Airlines, a Turkish cargo airline, said in a statement that its Boeing 747-400 was involved in the crash.  ACT Airlines said it was "deeply saddened" by the crash and noted that "the cause of the accident is unknown." Boeing, the plane's manufacturer, meanwhile extended its "deepest condolences" over the crash and offered to assist Kyrgyz authorities with the investigation.  Elmira Sheripova, a spokeswoman for the emergency services ministry, told AFP that 17 houses had been "completely destroyed" by the crashing plane. The country's Manas airport has since opened despite air authorities initially saying that the airport would remain closed until the evening.   Prime Minister Sooronbai Jeenbekov was heading a specially-appointed government commission to probe the crash and the country's state prosecutor also opened an investigation.   Kyrgyz President Almazbek Atambayev cancelled his visit to China to return to Bishkek, according to Kyrgyz media. Authorities said the country will observe a day of mourning on Tuesday.

REUTERS/Andrew Kelly Don't miss stories. Follow Raw Story! Follow @rawstory Just in time for his inauguration, London-based fintech firm Trading.co.uk is launching an app that will generate trading alerts for shares based on comments made on social media by Donald Trump. Keeping one eye on the U.S. President-elect’s personal Twitter feed has become a regular pastime for the fund managers and traders who invest billions of dollars daily on world stock, currency and commodity markets. Trump knocked several billion off the value of pharmaceutical stocks a week ago by saying they were “getting away with murder” with their prices. Comments earlier this week on China moved the dollar and a pair of December tweets sent the share prices of Lockheed Martin and Boeing spiraling lower. That plays to the growing group of technology startups that use computing power to process millions of messages posted online every day and generate early warnings on when shares are likely to move. (For a graphic on companies affected by a Trump tweet, click http://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/rngs/USA-TRUMP-COMPANIES/010031832S5/index.html) Trading.co.uk chief Gareth Mann said the Trump signal generator used artificial intelligence technology to differentiate between tweets or other messages that, for example, just mention Boeing and those liable to move markets. “It is impact analysis,” he said. “We can let you know when Trump tweets. We can let you know when he mentions a particular stock, or when he mentions a stock and a country. But if he just says he’s riding on a Boeing 747 the system will do nothing.” (Writing by Patrick Graham; Editing by Mark Potter) Report typos and corrections to corrections@rawstory.com About the AuthorReuters.com brings you the latest news from around the world, covering breaking news in business, politics, technology, and more.

You must sign in or register to continue reading content. EVERETT — Ray Stephanson, already Everett’s longest-serving mayor, plans to run for re-election this year. “I’m in,” Stephanson said on Monday. “For me, and what I look forward to for our city is seeing a lot of what we’ve started come to fruition.” Stephanson has been mayor since 2003, when he won a midterm election to fill out the end of Ed Hansen’s term. That year he narrowly defeated interim mayor Frank Anderson. Since then Stephanson has served three full terms, defeating former councilman Ron Gipson in 2005 and Jim Johnson in 2009. Stephanson ran unopposed in 2013. He’s overseen a period when Everett has experienced major growth in population and jobs. At the same time, the city has seen what some health officials describe as an epidemic of opiate use as well as increased homelessness. In 2014 he launched the Community Streets Initiative task force, a group of community leaders who drew up a long list of recommendations to tackle homelessness and the related problems of untreated mental health problems, addiction and street-level nuisances. The Safe Streets plan that grew out of that has included several programs, such as embedding social workers within a special police unit, launching a work program (now being taken over by HopeWorks), and the construction of a housing complex for the most vulnerable people in the homeless population. “There’s a lot of work to be done in that regard,” Stephanson said. “I very much want to be a part of that and do what I can to be supportive.” Stephanson also said that he wants to continue building on the economic growth the city has experienced with the new riverfront and waterfront housing projects and keeping Boeing’s 777X assembly and wing production in the city. He also lobbied heavily to have Washington State University establish its North Puget Sound campus in Everett, which he hopes will help support a growing medical industry in town. “I’m ready to go and ready to work hard and see these opportunities come to fruition,” Stephanson said. Stephanson faces a likely challenge from three-term Snohomish County Councilman Brian Sullivan. Sullivan represents District 2, which includes Everett, Mukilteo and Tulalip. The two have had several political disagreements over the years, especially over the establishment of commercial air service out of Paine Field. Stephanson has supported it, while Sullivan, a former Mukilteo mayor, was vehemently opposed. Stephanson’s drive to build a low-barrier housing project has angered many of the apartment building’s future neighbors in the Pinehurst and Glacier View neighborhoods. “I clearly understand and appreciate people’s concerns about providing supportive housing in the community,” Stephanson said. “I would say again that this is a solution that’s worked very well and has been proven in other communities, and we’ll have success here,” he said.

DiStefano writes about Philadelphia-area enterprise, and the people and money that make it go.  More by Joseph N. DiStefano Prison delay: Pa. appeals to builders after $21M manager doesn't deliver $400M opening date Jan 26 Age case: Lockheed must pay $51M to laid-off Penn Valley engineer Jan 27 Citizens Bank boss cheers Trump tax, reg moves, urges care on trade, immigration Jan 27 President-elect Donald Trump "has bashed [Comcast Corp.'s] NBC news as biased, inaccurate and bad" and cast contempt on Comcast's BuzzFeed pieces and Saturday Night Live skits. Trump even "went so far as to say he would not have allowed Comcast's acquisition of NBCUniversal," notes bond analyst Dave Novosel, in a report to clients of Gimme Credit LLC. The boycott of the inauguration by some Democrats will hurt Philly. But "despite the tough talk, we think it is likely that the Trump administration will be more lenient, from a regulatory perspective," if Comcast boss Brian Roberts opts to make another multibillion-dollar acquisition, Novosel said. Comcast is in a strong place to fund deals. The company collected $21 billion in free cash flow above costs over the last three years, and spent a full $16 billion of that to buy back shares, propping up the stock price. Novosel calls it "unlikely" that Comcast will divert that flow by attempting blockbuster combinations with T-Mobile, Sprint, Verizon, or Charter. More likely, it will try to buy more wireless spectrum whose prices in the recent government auction are off past highs. Comcast has been spending 11 percent to 12 percent of revenue on capital expenditures, such as expanding its WiFi network and updating aging parts of its network, Novosel notes. That still leaves room for the more modest acquisitions Comcast has pursued since its big TimeWarner cable deal was shot down. The company has spent just over $6 billion in the last three years on acquisitions, including $3.8 billion for DreamWorks Animation. Without the Olympics or presidential campaign spots, TV ad revenues will likely be down this year, but Comcast theme parks "continue to cruise," retransmission fees are up, and business services sales and internet revenue is growing smartly. So Gimme Credit, which does research on corporate bonds, recommends clients buy Comcast's investment-grade-rated debt at recent trading prices. Enthusiasm fades "Still no sign of Dow 20,000," reports Tom Siomades, head of Radnor-based Hartford Funds Investment Consulting Group, a $78 billion asset manager. "There was a lot of enthusiasm" raising share prices in the weeks after Trump's election, but now "the news is mostly Trump sniping back and forth with people who disagree with him," Siomades said. If the pros are skeptical, the public remains hopeful. Almost two-thirds of Pennsylvania investors expect the S&P 500 to rise strongly over the next six months, twice as many as expected that before Trump's election, according to a UBS survey cited by Brad Bernstein, senior vice president in the Swiss bank's Philly office. Trump's penchant for "taking aim at an industry" has provoked brief jumps and dips in shares of Boeing and Lockheed Martin, Siomades says. But investors need more than slogans before making long-term bets, he said. "Everyone likes lower taxes. Everyone likes the right to health care. But now it's time to start breaking it down and say, 'How much is it going to cost?' It's hugely important to get this right," Siomades said. With Trump's cabinet picks parading before Congress, "it's less nebulous than slogans. Now their feet are finally being held to the fire," he said. After Friday's inauguration and more earnings reports over the next week, and as the Trump administration unveils more concrete proposals in the coming months, the market should "decide on a direction" and "break out of the narrow range it has occupied for about a month," Siomades concluded.

Don’t worry, Trading.co.uk has got you covered Hands up if you like to tweet... If you’re worried that Donald Trump’s Twitter rampages might affect your portfolio then look no further, a London-based fintech group has got you covered. Trading.co.uk has developed an app that sends trading alerts any time President Trump mentions a stock in his comments on social media. In the past, it would have been frowned upon for traders and fund managers to be glued to their Twitter feeds, but with Trump’s recent outbursts on the social network, it’s become a regular pastime. His tweets about China earlier this week moved the US dollar, while a couple of tweets from just before Christmas sent Boeing and Lockheed Martin shares lower. Japanese carmaker Toyota also came under fire from the incoming President after revealing plans to build a new plant in Mexico, while tweets about drugs companies affected most of the industry. Trading.co.uk’s ‘Trump signal generator’ will only alert traders if the President-elect – who assumes office today – tweets something that is likely to move a stock’s price. "It is impact analysis," the firm’s chief executive Gareth Mann said. "We can let you know when Trump tweets. We can let you know when he mentions a particular stock, or when he mentions a stock and a country. But if he just says he's riding on a Boeing 747 the system will do nothing," he explained.

News Business Business News China economy beats expectations to grow 6.7% Consumption fuels achingly slow but much needed growth for the world’s second largest economy Bloomberg News Friday 20 January 2017 07:42 BST Click to follow The Independent Online Beijing wins limited breathing space as efforts to prop up the economy pay off Reuters China’s economy grew by 6.7 per cent last year, accelerating to 6.8 per cent in the last quarter – the first such growth in two years.  This cements an economic stabilisation that gives Beijing a buffer as it transitions to a neutral policy and prepares for potential trade tensions with Donald Trump. China powered through a volatile start to 2016, propelled by robust consumption from an increasingly wealthy middle class. With manufacturing also rebounding and deflation tamed, the Central Bank is turning to neutral policy to address a debt binge that inflated asset bubbles and could threaten the long-term outlook. Retail sales in December were up 10.9 per cent on the same period the year before – beating a projected rise of 10.7 per cent. Industrial production rose 6 per cent in December, just short of the estimated 6.1 per cent rise. Fixed-asset investment excluding rural areas expanded 8 .1 per cent for the full year. Read more China scraps construction of 85 planned coal power plants “As China’s traditional growth drivers of investment and exports have weakened, Chinese private consumption has become the key engine for economic growth,” said Rajiv Biswas, Asia-Pacific chief economist at IHS Global Insight in Singapore. “This trend is expected to continue over the medium term.” That points to continued stable growth ahead of a twice-a-decade Communist Party leadership reshuffle this year. Consumption accounted for 64 per cent of 2016 growth. Services, which accounted for more than half of output for the first time in 2015, made up 51.6 per cent last year, official data showed. Yet, behind the solid headline figures, there’s a widening divergence among regions and industries that’s creating winners and losers across the nation of 1.4 billion people. The full-year expansion in 2017 will edge lower to 6.4 per cen, according to Bloomberg, while the IMF has raised its forecast to 6.5 per cent. Maintaining growth requires fending off policy challenges including a slumping yuan that posted its biggest annual drop in two decades, and increasing capital flight pressure. Read more Policymakers unleashed more fiscal stimulus last year to help prop up growth, in addition to keeping the old benchmark interest rate at a record low. New money supply management tools are coming to the fore as an alternative to broad easing that could weaken the yuan. Reflation has been a bright spot as the producer price index snapped four years of deflation. Manufacturing has strengthened with official gauges at or near multi-year highs. Beyond those promising signals, exports have fallen for months amid tepid global demand. While the economic rebalancing toward consumer-led growth continues, reforms of inefficient state-owned enterprises in heavy industries have stalled – the old smokestack economy came roaring back last year, competing more for capital against private firms.

By India Ashok January 20, 2017 06:13 GMT Close Twitter, immigration and Russia: Why Donald Trump’s presidency could be unprecedented IBTimes UK A tech firm has created a dedicated stock market monitoring app that has been designed to chart the fluctuations in stocks based on comments made by incoming US President Donald Trump on social media. London-based fintech company Trading.co.uk is launching the app just in time for Trump's inauguration, according to reports. Trump's tweets have previously reportedly caused major variations in stock markets. His comments on a pharmaceutical firm "getting away with murder", led to several billion dollars worth of the firm's stocks being knocked off. Trump's comments earlier in the week about China also impacted the value of the dollar and a few of his tweets from December 2016 on Lockheed Martin and Boeing reportedly saw both the firms' shares slump drastically. Trump's social media activities gave rise to Trading.co.uk's app. According to the firm's head, Gareth Mann, the app will make use of AI (artificial intelligence) to wade through social media posts and messages, differentiating between them, in efforts to determine comments that just mention a firm or those likely to move markets, Reuters reported. The app will then generate early warnings to users about when shares are anticipated to move. "It is impact analysis," Mann said. "We can let you know when Trump tweets. We can let you know when he mentions a particular stock, or when he mentions a stock and a country. But if he just says he's riding on a Boeing 747 the system will do nothing."

Janardhanan has said that the Union Ministry of Civil Aviation is likely to continue its policy of disallowing wide-bodied aircraft at the airport on account of the short runway. The Airports Authority of India (AAI) had suspended the operation of Code E aircraft at the Calicut International Airport following a directive from the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA). “Passenger traffic fell by 18% during this period. Wide-bodied aircraft can be operated only with the expansion of the runway,” he said. The airport has a tabletop runway with Takeoff Run Available (TORA) and Landing Distance Available (LDA) at 2,850 m. Hence, the operation of Code E aircraft would not be in compliance with the DCGA’s civil aviation requirements. However, Mr. Janardhanan said air passengers from north Kerala, who had been experiencing air connectivity problems, especially to the Gulf nations, could heave a sigh of relief with the Calicut airport set to resume round-the-clock operations from March 1. Since September 2015, the airport has remained closed for eight hours daily for runway strengthening and resurfacing works. The runway was closed from noon to 8 p.m., but the airport functioned with flights landing and taking off for the rest of the day. “We will carry out a review of the works next month. The first and second stages of works have been completed before time. The laying of the final phase of the runway got delayed for various reasons including strike by quarry workers, non-availability of bitumen and the monsoon,” Mr. Janardhanan said. The total cost of the project has come up to ₹60 crore. Work on the new international air complex and other facilities at the cost of ₹120 crore was going on, he said. The airport had been partially shut down for the runway work from May 1, 2015 to ensure the safety of flights. Boeing B-747 and B-777, Airbus A-330, and other wide-bodied aircraft under Code E including, Saudia (Saudi Arabian Airlines) and Emirates, were not allowed to operate. The State government has given administrative sanction to acquire 485.3 acres of land for the expansion work. At least 240 acres of land was required for extending the runway to make the airport suitable for operation of Code E aircraft, officials said. The decision not to allow wide-bodied aircraft had affected hundreds of Haj pilgrims. The Calicut airport had been the embarkation point for pilgrims in the State, but it was shifted to the Cochin International Airport two years ago.

(Photo: United Launch Alliance) 524 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 2 COMMENTEMAILMORE CAPE CANAVERAL — Since the 1960s, U.S. satellites have sought to detect and provide early warnings of ballistic missile launches. A $1.2 billion mission, scheduled to blast off from Cape Canaveral at 7:42 p.m. ET Friday on an Atlas V rocket, aims to add the latest spacecraft to that effort, which tracks a growing number of missiles scattered over a much wider area than the original Cold War threat. The launch was scrubbed Thursday evening after an aircraft entered the hazard area during the countdown. “In today’s world, and certainly over the last 20 years, the proliferation of missiles outside that concentrated area has grown demonstrably,” said Col. Dennis Bythewood, director of the Air Force’s Remote Sensing Systems Directorate at Los Angeles Air Force Base. “Regional systems present in Asia and the Middle East are well within the range of our deployed forces, as we’ve seen over the last years of combat operations.” USA TODAY SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket launches, lands in California The number of ballistic missiles increased by more than 1,200 over the past five years, according to the Missile Defense Agency, and more than 5,900 are based outside the United States, North Atlantic Treaty Organization member nations, Russia and China. United Launch Alliance’s 194-foot Atlas V rocket rolled to its Launch Complex 41 pad Wednesday morning with the third satellite in the Air Force’s Space Based Infrared System, or SBIRS. The system is modernizing and replacing the legacy Defense Support Program, which began launching in 1970. On Wednesday morning, a United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket carrying the U.S. Air Force's third Space Based Infrared System missile warning satellite rolled from a processing tower to the pad at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station's Launch Complex 41. Launch is targeted for 7:46 p.m. Thursday, at the opening of a 40-minute window.  (Photo: United Launch Alliance) The new satellites, built by Lockheed Martin, carry more powerful infrared sensors that scan the ground twice as fast, enabling them to spot dimmer targets and missiles with shorter engine burns. “With amazing precision, timing and accuracy, we can detect, track and process infrared information, and then transmit it via secure communications links to decision makers and military leaders around the globe,” said Dave Sheridan, SBIRS program director at Lockheed Martin. Combined with sensors on satellites in different orbits and software on the ground, the system identifies where a missile has launched from and predicts where it will impact. “The capability of the satellites that we’re launching now basically cuts in half the amount of time it takes for the satellite to find and fix a missile launch on the face of the Earth, and then feed that into our missile warning network,” said Bythewood. Exactly how long that takes is classified. This week's launch was delayed from October after a Lockheed Martin supplier reported a problem on another satellite equipped with a similar main engine. The engine is key to the satellite reaching the right orbit after being dropped off by the rocket. An investigation cleared the propulsion system on the new satellite known as SBIRS GEO Flight 3, referencing the program’s third satellite bound for a geosynchronous orbit, where satellites match the speed of Earth’s rotation and appear to hold a fixed position in the sky. “We feel very comfortable that we’ve got a good engine on GEO Flight 3 and that it’s ready to fly,” said Bythewood.

Launch is targeted for 7:46 p.m. Thursday, at the opening of a 40-minute window.  (Photo: United Launch Alliance) The mission’s $1.2 billion cost includes the launch and at least 12 years of operations in orbit. A fourth SBIRS satellite is expected to launch in November on another Atlas V to complete a global constellation. The system's first two satellites launched in 2011 and 2013. The mission, now set for Friday, will be the 69th by an Atlas V. It’s the first of at least seven Cape missions planned this year for United Launch Alliance, a Boeing-Lockheed Martin joint venture formed just over a decade ago.

Photo: Reuters mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 8:50 AM, January 21, 2017 Updated: 10:40 AM, January 22, 2017 SAN FRANCISCO - U.S. President Donald Trump's administration is only hours old, but already a small parade of S&P 500 companies' chiefs have voiced optimism that his promised tax cuts, stimulus spending and deregulation will boost corporate profits. In the days ahead of Friday's inauguration, senior executives from Morgan Stanley <MS.N>, Delta Air Lines <DAL.N> and other major U.S. corporations said the Trump White House has already sparked a brighter outlook for business. "There is certainly more reason to be optimistic as we enter 2017 than there was at the beginning of 2016," Morgan Stanley CEO James Gorman said on Tuesday after his bank said profit doubled in the fourth quarter. He pointed to factors including a surge in consumer confidence after the Nov. 8 election and lower taxes promised by Trump. Just under way, fourth-quarter earnings reporting season is providing a glimpse of what major large companies expect under Trump, and their take is largely positive so far. Over a dozen S&P 500 companies reporting results in the last week have signaled optimism about potential tax cuts, infrastructure spending, employee benefit costs and reduced regulation. With corporate earnings already on the mend after a slump in oil prices and a strong dollar last year, S&P 500 companies are expected on average to grow their earnings by 6.3 percent in the December quarter and 13.6 percent in the March quarter, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Since the November election, the S&P 500 has rallied 6 percent to record highs, in part due to expectations Trump will pass policies that stimulate the economy. Banks have led gains, with investors betting Trump will roll back regulations passed by President Barack Obama following the 2008 financial crisis, which many investors say went too far. After United Continental Holdings <UAL.N> on Tuesday posted lower December-quarter profits, airline President Scott Kirby told analysts on a call, "It feels like we are on a really good path. It felt to me like there was an inflection point after the election for business demand." An also upbeat Delta Air Lines Chief Executive Ed Bastian told analysts this month that he was excited about potential infrastructure spending promised by Trump, as well as a chance to make his case about unfair competition from Middle Eastern airlines heavily subsidized by governments. Vince Delie, Chief Executive of F.N.B. <FNB.N>, which own First National Bank, said on a quarterly conference call on Thursday that he was saw more confidence among commercial customers and a potential pickup in lending. "There are at least conversations occurring about larger capex opportunities within our customer base, which didn't happen before," Delie said. Not everyone is over the moon, however. Kansas City Southern's CEO <KSU.N> bemoaned an uncertain environment on Friday after the cross-border railroad reported lower quarterly profits, hurt by a slump in Mexico's peso since Trump's election. "Obviously the political and economic uncertainty is probably first and foremost on most of our minds, and the irony of us reporting earnings on the Inauguration Day of the 45th President is not entirely lost on us," Chief Executive Patrick Ottensmeyer told analysts. Indeed, some business leaders and lobbyists in Washington who were initially enthusiastic about Trump's victory have begun to exhibit some hesitance over his agenda amid confusing messages on healthcare, taxes and trade. SURGING CONFIDENCE Still, while Trump's views on immigration and a range of other issues are at odd with many Americans, most small businesses and consumers do see a brighter future as he launches his presidency. An index of small business confidence in December hit a 12-year high, according to the National Federation of Independent Business. The U.S. consumer confidence index in December hit its highest level since August 2001, a month before the Sept. 11 attacks. Following strong stock gains in November and December, many on Wall Street are concerned that Trump may fail to deliver on all of his promises. A Republican-controlled Congress might balk at infrastructure spending or tax reductions that significantly widen the federal budget deficit. Other investors worry that Trump could follow through on campaign-trail threats to tear up global trade deals and crack down on illegal immigrants from Mexico who provide low-wage labor in agriculture, restaurants and other industries. "Folks are potentially underestimating the degree to which Trump is serious about real reform on trade an immigration," warned Jon Adams, senior investment strategist at BMO Global Asset Management. "Investors, in general, are hopeful Trump will take a more pragmatic approach on those issues." Over the past two months, Trump has publicly targeted and threatened a range of multinationals, including Ford Motor <F.N>, General Motors <GM.N>, Boeing Co <BA.N> and Lockheed Martin <LMT.N>. That may have left CEOs wary of publicly disagreeing with his policies. "You don't want to step on a mine. So the best course of action is to be somewhat optimistic, positive but also somewhat noncommittal so you're not trapped one way or another," said Robert Pavlik, chief market strategist at Boston Private Wealth in New York. Trump's frequent use of Twitter to single out companies for criticism or praise has created volatile spikes in trading of their shares, which is good for online brokers including Charles Schwab <SCHW.N> and TD Ameritrade <AMTD.O>. "Each time, it's a new market event and a potential trading opportunity for our clients. Like everyone else, we're watching it with interest," TD Ameritrade Director of Finance Jeff Goeser said on a conference call on Wednesday after the company reported an increase in quarterly profits.

REUTERS/Andrew Kelly By Noel Randewich | SAN FRANCISCO SAN FRANCISCO U.S. President Donald Trump's administration is only hours old, but already a small parade of S&P 500 companies' chiefs have voiced optimism that his promised tax cuts, stimulus spending and deregulation will boost corporate profits. In the days ahead of Friday's inauguration, senior executives from Morgan Stanley (MS.N), Delta Air Lines (DAL.N) and other major U.S. corporations said the Trump White House has already sparked a brighter outlook for business. "There is certainly more reason to be optimistic as we enter 2017 than there was at the beginning of 2016," Morgan Stanley CEO James Gorman said on Tuesday after his bank said profit doubled in the fourth quarter. He pointed to factors including a surge in consumer confidence after the Nov. 8 election and lower taxes promised by Trump. Just under way, fourth-quarter earnings reporting season is providing a glimpse of what major large companies expect under Trump, and their take is largely positive so far. Over a dozen S&P 500 companies reporting results in the last week have signaled optimism about potential tax cuts, infrastructure spending, employee benefit costs and reduced regulation. With corporate earnings already on the mend after a slump in oil prices and a strong dollar last year, S&P 500 companies are expected on average to grow their earnings by 6.3 percent in the December quarter and 13.6 percent in the March quarter, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Since the November election, the S&P 500 has rallied 6 percent to record highs, in part due to expectations Trump will pass policies that stimulate the economy. Banks have led gains, with investors betting Trump will roll back regulations passed by President Barack Obama following the 2008 financial crisis, which many investors say went too far. After United Continental Holdings (UAL.N) on Tuesday posted lower December-quarter profits, airline President Scott Kirby told analysts on a call, "It feels like we are on a really good path. It felt to me like there was an inflection point after the election for business demand." An also upbeat Delta Air Lines Chief Executive Ed Bastian told analysts this month that he was excited about potential infrastructure spending promised by Trump, as well as a chance to make his case about unfair competition from Middle Eastern airlines heavily subsidized by governments. Vince Delie, Chief Executive of F.N.B. (FNB.N), which own First National Bank, said on a quarterly conference call on Thursday that he was saw more confidence among commercial customers and a potential pickup in lending. "There are at least conversations occurring about larger capex opportunities within our customer base, which didn't happen before," Delie said. Not everyone is over the moon, however. Kansas City Southern's CEO (KSU.N) bemoaned an uncertain environment on Friday after the cross-border railroad reported lower quarterly profits, hurt by a slump in Mexico's peso since Trump's election. "Obviously the political and economic uncertainty is probably first and foremost on most of our minds, and the irony of us reporting earnings on the Inauguration Day of the 45th President is not entirely lost on us," Chief Executive Patrick Ottensmeyer told analysts. Indeed, some business leaders and lobbyists in Washington who were initially enthusiastic about Trump's victory have begun to exhibit some hesitance over his agenda amid confusing messages on healthcare, taxes and trade. SURGING CONFIDENCE Still, while Trump's views on immigration and a range of other issues are at odd with many Americans, most small businesses and consumers do see a brighter future as he launches his presidency. An index of small business confidence in December hit a 12-year high, according to the National Federation of Independent Business. The U.S. consumer confidence index in December hit its highest level since August 2001, a month before the Sept. 11 attacks. Following strong stock gains in November and December, many on Wall Street are concerned that Trump may fail to deliver on all of his promises. A Republican-controlled Congress might balk at infrastructure spending or tax reductions that significantly widen the federal budget deficit. Other investors worry that Trump could follow through on campaign-trail threats to tear up global trade deals and crack down on illegal immigrants from Mexico who provide low-wage labor in agriculture, restaurants and other industries. "Folks are potentially underestimating the degree to which Trump is serious about real reform on trade an immigration," warned Jon Adams, senior investment strategist at BMO Global Asset Management. "Investors, in general, are hopeful Trump will take a more pragmatic approach on those issues." Over the past two months, Trump has publicly targeted and threatened a range of multinationals, including Ford Motor (F.N), General Motors (GM.N), Boeing Co (BA.N) and Lockheed Martin (LMT.N). That may have left CEOs wary of publicly disagreeing with his policies. "You don't want to step on a mine. So the best course of action is to be somewhat optimistic, positive but also somewhat noncommittal so you're not trapped one way or another," said Robert Pavlik, chief market strategist at Boston Private Wealth in New York. Trump's frequent use of Twitter to single out companies for criticism or praise has created volatile spikes in trading of their shares, which is good for online brokers including Charles Schwab (SCHW.N) and TD Ameritrade (AMTD.O). "Each time, it's a new market event and a potential trading opportunity for our clients. Like everyone else, we're watching it with interest," TD Ameritrade Director of Finance Jeff Goeser said on a conference call on Wednesday after the company reported an increase in quarterly profits.

Find out why. Dan Caplinger (TMFGalagan) Jan 20, 2017 at 6:52PM Friday was a positive day for the stock market. The Dow Jones Industrials climbed by 95 points and there were similarly modest advances for the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite. The inauguration of the 45th president of the U.S. commanded the attention of many, both on and off Wall Street today, but many market participants pointed to the day's gains as a natural bounce after five straight days of losses for the Dow. With the broader market waiting for more clarity on the political and economic outlook looking ahead to the rest of the year, many investors looked to individual stocks rather than the market, as a whole. Among the worst performers today were Rite Aid (NYSE:RAD), Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY), and TransDigm Group (NYSE:TDG). Below, we'll look more closely at these stocks to tell you why they did so poorly. Image source: Rite Aid. Rite Aid investors fear FTC rejection Rite Aid plunged 13% in the wake of reports that the Federal Trade Commission might oppose its proposed merger with Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA). Rite Aid had hoped that its proposal to sell 865 of its drugstore locations to Fred's (NASDAQ:FRED) would be enough to satisfy the FTC, but skeptics are concerned that Fred's might not have the capacity to provide ample competition to Walgreens and CVS Health if the Rite Aid merger happens. After today's drop, Rite Aid trades at a 17% discount to the proposed $9 per-share buyout price, and that shows just how scared investors are that the deal won't go through as planned. Bristol-Myers Squibb slows down Bristol-Myers Squibb dropped 11% after saying late Thursday that it would not seek an accelerated regulatory review from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for its proposed combination therapy for lung cancer. Many investors had hoped that the combination of its Yervoy and Opdivo drugs would prove effective enough to spur Bristol to look for fast-track approval, especially in light of the FDA approval of a key competitor's drug for lung cancer. Nevertheless, Bristol didn't give details in its release, leaving many to speculate that the treatment's effectiveness might not have been as high as they had hoped. Now, investors will have to wait to see Bristol's next move. TransDigm loses altitude Finally, TransDigm Group lost 10%. The aerospace components and systems supplier found itself the target of short-selling research firm Citron Research and analyst Andrew Left, whose report suggested that the company might be "the Valeant of the aerospace industry." In particular, the report capitalized on criticism that President Trump has attributed to Boeing and Lockheed Martin, suggesting that the pricing practices that TransDigm uses could be even more egregious. Citron's valuation of the stock wasn't quite as dire as some of its past calls have been, suggesting that the shares might be worth $166. Yet that's still more than 25% lower than where TransDigm closed today, and it will be interesting to see if the new president takes note of the attack from Left. Dan Caplinger owns shares of Boeing.

With the upward move, the Dow snapped a five-session losing streak. The major averages finished the day in positive territory but off their highs of the session. The Dow advanced 94.85 points or 0.5 percent to 19,827.25, the Nasdaq rose 15.25 points or 0.3 percent to 5,555.33 and the S&P 500 climbed 7.62 points or 0.3 percent to 2,271.31. Despite the gains on the day, the major averages moved lower for the week. The Dow and the S&P 500 both dipped by 0.3 percent, while the S&P 500 edged down by 0.1 percent. Bargain hunting contributed to the initial strength on Wall Street, although traders seemed focused on President Donald Trump's inaugural address after he was officially sworn in as the 45th president. Trump remained light on policy details in his remarks but pledged to lead an administration that puts America first. The speech hewed closely to the themes of Trump's presidential campaign, offering a populist message and promising to solve the many problems he sees facing the nation. Trump touted his plan to boost infrastructure spending, which a new Gallup poll showed Americans think is his most important campaign promise to keep. The president's remarks have been described as protectionist, as he lamented U.S. policies that have enriched foreign industry and subsidized the armies of other countries at the expense of America's industry and military. He argued that this has ripped the wealth of the middle class from their homes and redistributed it all across the world. "But that is the past. And now, we are looking only to the future," Trump said. "We assembled here today are issuing a new decree to be heard in every city, in every foreign capital, and in every hall of power." "From this day forward, a new vision will govern our land," he added. "From this day forward, it's going to be only America first." Trump concluded his relatively brief remarks by reiterating his frequent campaign pledge to "Make America Great again." Sector News Airline stocks move significantly higher over the course of the trading session, resulting in a 1.5 percent advance by the NYSE Arca Airline Index. Southwest Airlines (LUV) and United Continental (UAL) turned in two of the airline sector's best performances on the day. Considerable strength was also visible among semiconductor stocks, as reflected by the 1.3 percent gain posted by the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index. With the gain, the index reached its best closing level in almost a month. Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) posted a standout gain after the wireless handset chip supplier reported better than expected first quarter results and provided upbeat guidance. The company also announced a $500 million stock buyback. Oil service, gold and electronic storage stocks also saw notable strength on the day, while most of the other major sectors showed more modest moves. Other Markets In overseas trading, stock markets across the Asia-Pacific region turned in a mixed performance during trading on Friday. Japan's Nikkei 225 Index rose by 0.3 percent, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index dropped by 0.7 percent. The major European markets also ended the day mixed. While the U.K.'s FTSE 100 Index edged down by 0.1 percent, the French CAC 40 Index and the German DAX Index rose by 0.2 percent and 0.3 percent, respectively. In the bond, treasuries closed roughly flat after recovering from an early move to the downside. As a result, the yield on the benchmark ten-year note, which moves opposite of its price, inched up by less than a basis point to 2.467 percent after reaching a high of 2.513 percent. Looking Ahead Next week's trading may be impacted by reaction to the latest batch of economic data, including reports on new and existing home sales, durable goods orders, and fourth quarter GDP. Traders are also likely to keep an eye on any significant developments in Washington as Trump begins his first full week as president. On the earnings front, 3M (MMM), McDonald's (MCD), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Boeing (BA), AT&T (T), Ford (F), Intel (INTC), Microsoft (MSFT), and Chevron (CVX) are among a slew of companies due to report their quarterly results next week. by RTT Staff Writer For comments and feedback: editorial@rttnews.com Business News The World's 10 Most Productive Nations, Ranked Biotech Stocks Facing FDA Decision In February In Memorium: Business Giants We Lost In 2016 More Top Stories Trump Signs Order Instituting "Extreme Vetting" Of Immigrants Stocks Close Roughly Flat For Second Straight Day - U.S. Commentary Abercrombie & Fitch Issues 150 Pink Slips Trump Discusses Mexico, Russia, Brexit In News Conference With May Trump To Speak With Putin By Phone On Saturday Feds Claim Breathometer Made False Claims About Accuracy Trump Expresses Support For "Nuclear Option" Over Supreme Court Nominee Stocks Continue To Lack Direction In Mid-Day Trading - U.S. Commentary Stocks Continue To Experience Choppy Trading - U.S. Commentary Report: Wet Seal Will Go Extinct Trump Accuses Mexico Of Taking Advantage Of U.S. Study Shows How Jet Lag Affects Baseball Teams McDonald's Sells All Of Its Nordic Restaurants U.S. Consumer Sentiment Reaches Thirteen-Year High In January Tim Hortons Coming To Mexico <<Previous        103 Articles Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus Follow RTT Editor's Pick Most Read Most Emailed McDonald's Sells All Of Its Nordic Restaurants Tim Hortons Coming To Mexico Chevron Turns To Profit In Q4, But Results Miss Estimates Air Products Sees Q2, FY17 Adj.

The deal will come after Iran, which had not directly purchased a Western-built plane in nearly 40 years, signed contracts with Europe's Airbus and U.S. rival Boeing last year to purchase about 180 jets. That became possible after an agreement between Iran and six major powers lifted most international sanctions imposed on Tehran, in exchange for Iran curbing its nuclear programme. "We have concluded the negotiations and we should sign the contract imminently," ATR Chief Executive Christian Scherer said. Scherer was responding to some Iranian media reports on Friday that ATR had already announced the signature of the keenly awaited deal. Iranian officials said in December that a deal for 20 twin-engine turboprop ATR 72-600 aircraft was close. IranAir and ATR have spent months negotiating a firm order for 20 ATR 72-600 aircraft worth 540 million euros ($576 million) at list prices, with options for another 20. All three manufacturers have received U.S. Treasury export licences to sell to Iran, a step required even for European firms since all modern Western aircraft rely on many U.S. parts. Even so, industry sources say all three may need further approvals or extended cover in order to complete deliveries. That is likely to re-focus industry attention on the direction taken by U.S. President Donald Trump, who has voiced opposition to the nuclear sanctions deal.

Arise News – ARISE News is a 24 hour international television news channel … Trump Assumes Office In a Storm of Controversy News Analysis Okechukwu Uwaezuoke with agency reports By noon (local time) today, Donald John Trump assumes office as the most unpopular newly-elected American president in at least four decades. Two polls, released on Tuesday, agree on the fact that the billionaire, who becomes the 45th American president, holds the lowest approval ratings record in recent memory. Indeed, both ABC News/Washington Post and CNN/ORC polls showed he had dismally poor approval ratings. According to these polls, just 40 per cent of Americans view him favourably. The former rates his six predecessors as follows: Jimmy Carter (78 per cent), Ronald Reagan (58 per cent), George H.W. Bush (65 per cent), Bill Clinton (68 per cent), George W. Bush (62 per cent) and Obama (79 per cent), while the latter rated Clinton (67 per cent), George W Bush (61 per cent) and Obama (84 per cent). Meanwhile, Trump has dismissed the polls as “phony” and “rigged”, arguing in a tweet: “The same people who did the phony election polls, and were so wrong, are now doing approval rating polls. They are rigged just like before.” Indeed, the same survey had said that 44 per cent of Americans believe that Trump is qualified to serve as president, while a majority (52 per cent) say he is not. While on the campaign trail last year, Trump had frequently blasted them out on Twitter. This was even when they had good news for him. But he would accuse media organisations of rigging the numbers when they showed him behind his rivals. On the eve of the general election, Trump narrowly trailed his main rival, the Democratic Party nominee, Hillary Clinton. The latter hovered anywhere from 2 to 4 percentage points over her Republican rival. Curiously, Trump captured the Electoral College to win the presidency, while Clinton won the popular vote by nearly 2.9 million (65,844,954 to 62,979,879) — an advantage of slightly more than 2 per cent. Add to Trump’s unenviable record-the fact that his cabinet will be the first without a single Latino member since the Ronald Reagan administration. The Washington Post says that every previous administration has had a secretary or top ambassador of Latino descent. This began with Reagan’s appointment of Lauro Cavazos as education secretary in the waning months of his presidency in 1988. The Post also observed that “Trump’s Cabinet won’t have a Democrat, just three women, one African-American man—and no Latino.” A feud between the newly elected president and the civil rights’ icon and congressman, John Lewis, has led to a rising number of Democratic lawmakers planning to boycott his inauguration. Already, over 50 House Democrats have confirmed that they will not witness Trump’s swearing-in ceremony as the 45th US president. To Lewis’s assertion last Friday that Trump’s inauguration would be the first one he would miss since being elected to Congress in the 1980s, Trump pointed to Lewis’ absence from George W. Bush’s inauguration in 2001. “John Lewis said about my inauguration, ‘It will be the first one that I’ve missed.’ WRONG (or lie)!” Trump tweeted Tuesday morning. “He boycotted Bush 43 also because he… thought it would be hypocritical to attend Bush’s swearing-in….he doesn’t believe Bush is the true elected president.’ Sound familiar! WP”. “WP” in Trump’s tweet is an allusion to the Washington Post, which in its January 21, 2001 edition had reported that Lewis was among a group of Congressional Black Caucus members who had decided to boycott George W. Bush’s first inauguration. Bush’s ascension to office was tarnished by a contentious Supreme Court decision over the Florida recount. The Washington Post had said that “John Lewis, for instance, spent the day in his Atlanta district. He thought it would be hypocritical to attend Bush’s swearing-in because he doesn’t believe Bush is the true elected president.” Lewis had courted controversy when during last Friday “Meet the Press” interview he said he does not consider Trump to be a “legitimate president”. Trump’s volley of tweets followed on Saturday morning and continued into that evening. But Trump’s feud with Lewis at a time when the US is commemorating the legacy of Martin Luther King Jr. led to the increase of Democratic lawmakers from the initial small group who had planned to boycott the inauguration to over 50, many of whom cited Trump’s tweets about Lewis as their reason. Perhaps, in a bid to ease tensions, Trump met with Martin Luther King III in New York on Monday to discuss voting rights. Yet, his ill-advised brawl with Lewis – a man who was clubbed by the police and hospitalised during the 1965’s historic civil rights march from Selma to Montgomery – could potentially further hurt his relations with the African-American community and even pitch the Democrats against the Republicans. It is ironic that Lewis’s charge of illegitimacy should be a source of irritation for Trump. Did he not spend years trying to prove the same about his predecessor’s presidency? Besides, Trump’s quirky habit of tweeting his response at a slightest provocation remains a cause for concern among those who think his tweets could unleash unsavoury global consequences. Lewis based his decision not to attend Trump’s inauguration on the alleged Russian interference in the November election. Hence, the civil rights icon’s allusion to Trump’s illegitimacy. But even with the controversy swirling around him, Americans have one good reason to look forward to his presidency: job-creation. The real estate developer’s last November’s win at the presidential polls seemed to have spurred many companies to announce the creation of new factories or jobs in the US. Among them are the air conditioning manufacturer, Carrier, Japan’s SoftBank, Ford, Fiat Chrysler and Amazon, which famously promised to create 100,000 jobs. Also, there were cheery announcements by Wal-Mart and General Motors. While the former announced on Tuesday that it would invest $6.8 billion in the US and create 10,000 jobs, the latter offered $1 billion in new US investments and pledged to create 5,000 new jobs. For this, Trump took the credit in his Tuesday tweet. “With all of the jobs I am bringing back into the US (even before taking office), with all of the new auto plants coming back into our country and with the massive cost reductions I have negotiated on military purchases and more, I believe the people are seeing ‘big stuff,’” he claimed. Trump last month also denounced the $4 billion price tag on the next presidential plane, which is currently being developed, with a threat to cancel the order unless the price came down. This led to the visit of the aviation giant Boeing’s CEO Dennis Muilenburg to Trump Tower in Manhattan on Tuesday. Muilenburg would tell reporters afterwards that he and Trump were “on the same page” about the cost and value of the jet. On the foreign scene, while his foreign policy proposals had appeared vague and contradictory during his campaign, Russia and Israel had openly rooted for his presidency. Meanwhile, his NATO allies were discomfited by his recent remarks to the effect that the alliance is obsolete. He came short of berating Germany for its open-door policy on refugees. Meanwhile, preparations for his inauguration had entered the final stages since Sunday when organisers carried out a rehearsal of the ceremony and parade, with a military officer who is the same height as Trump standing in for the president-elect. Washington DC’s central axis, running from the White House to the Capitol, where Trump will be sworn in, has been cordoned off. The task of ensuring safety at the event has been entrusted to about 28,000 security forces, some of whom are already on duty in the streets of Washington. Perhaps, a major security challenge is the planned protest march by hundreds of thousands of protesters on Friday and Saturday.

Lifestyle Tech News Samsung’s virtual assistant Bixby might make Google redundant for smartphone users Tech giant's answer to Siri can reportedly find the real-world items around you online, letting you make quick purchases Aatif Sulleyman Friday 20 January 2017 11:57 BST Click to follow The Independent Tech The virtual assistant will debut on the Galaxy S8, but it's not yet clear if Bixby will come to existing Samsung devices REUTERS/Kim Hong-Ji TPX IMAGES OF THE DAY Exciting new details about Bixby, the virtual assistant set to debut on Samsung’s upcoming Galaxy S8, have emerged in a new report. According to SamMobile, Samsung’s answer to Siri and Google Assistant will be able to leverage the handset’s camera in order to identify real-world objects. The camera app on the S8 is said to feature a dedicated Bixby button, which will launch a search tool capable of recognising any object the camera happens to be focused on.  From there, you’ll be able to track down the item online and even purchase it, which could prove a dangerously convenient feature for shopaholics.

He is no 324 on the worldwide list of billionaires and no 113 in the United States.  Early in his campaign, Trump had said he was worth in excess of $10 billion, and he had reiterated that claim on May 17 when he had gone to submit an updated financial disclosure to the US Federal Election Commission.  Here is a look at President Barack Obama as he turns over the presidency, his net worth and plans for the future.  For his day job as president, Barack Obama earned $400,000 a year throughout his entire eight-year term — a salary that incoming president Trump has vowed to forgo. The president also receives a $50,000 annual expense account, a $100,000 non-taxable travel account and a $19,000 entertainment budget.  On April 15, 2016, President Obama released his 2015 tax returns which showed that he and First Lady Michelle Obama filed jointly and reported an adjusted gross income of $436,065. They paid $81,472 in taxes according to their 18.7 percent tax rate. They also donated a total of $64,066 to more than 30 charities.  The Business Insider, a German-owned American news website with 70 million unique monthly visitors, which also operates international editions in Australia, India, Malaysia, Indonesia, Singapore, China, Italy and the UK, has chronicled the following timeline of Barack Obama’s wealth: Year 2004: Obama earned a salary of $80,287 from the Illinois State Senate and $32,144 from the University of Chicago Law School, where he taught. The president also had assets in four financial funds worth between $50,000 and $100,000 each.  Year 2005: Obama signed a multi-book deal with Random House and received a $1.9 million advance for “The Audacity  of Hope”, plus royalties, following his appearance at the 2004 Democratic National Convention. Also that year he earned just over $847,000 of another book advance, plus $378,000 of additional book royalties. Meanwhile, his investments grew with the addition of a Nuveen Floating Rate Income Fund valued between $50,000 and $100,000. He also reported deposit accounts valued between $150,000 and $350,000.  Year 2006: Obama reported book royalties of just under $150,000, plus $425,000 of an additional book advance. He also acquired publicly-traded assets worth tens of thousands, including funds with Goldman Sachs and Vanguard.  Year 2007: Obama earned $3.3 million book royalties from Random House and $816,000 from Dystel & Goderich Literary Management. He acquired a Northern Municipal Money Market Fund valued between $1 million and $5 million, in addition to the US Treasury notes valued between $500,000 and $1 million. For his daughters, he invested in two 529 college savings plans valued around $200,000 each.  Year 2008: When Obama was elected as president, he owned somewhere between $1 million and $5.1 million in the US treasury bills.  Year 2009: Obama won the Nobel Peace Prize, which came with a $1.4 million award. He donated it to an assortment of charities.  Years 2009 to 2015: Obama earned $400,000 a year as president and continued to earn book royalties, as well as interest on his investments.  Barack Obama’s life beyond the presidency: According to the 1958 Former Presidents Act, Obama will receive the salary of a Cabinet secretary for the rest of his life. Currently, that is $205,700 a year. Among the other perks are health insurance and round-the-clock Secret Service protection until his death. The cost of Secret Service protection are not made public, but Obama will also receive funds for an office, staff and related expenses, which George W. Bush took advantage of to the tune of $1.1 million in 2015.  Many presidents establish foundations and enjoy lucrative second careers as in-demand speakers and authors. Although there is no hard data on Obama’s previous speaking fees, past presidents such as George W. Bush have earned between $100,000 and $175,000 per engagement after they left the White House.  According to CNN, former president Bill Clinton and his wife Hillary had earned an average of $210,795 per speech in the 15 or so years since he left office. That totals approximately $153 million for 729 paid speaking engagements.  The American University in Washington DC has estimated that the Obamas could make as many as 50 speeches a year once he is out of office, earning a conservative $200,000 apiece, hence coming close to the $200 million mark before taxes.  According to The New York Times, Obama has already proven to be an accomplished and popular author. Following the presidency, he could earn about $30 million for his memoir, while Michelle Obama could garner an estimated $10 million for hers.  Around Washington DC’s posh Kalorama neighbourhood, where Trump’s daughter Ivanka Trump also owns a home, the Obamas have leased an 8,200-square-foot, nine-bedroom mansion that was built in 1928. The spacious home last sold for $5.3 million in 2014 and is estimated to be worth $6.3 million today.  Donald Trump’s inherited wealth and further development: Born into a wealthy family, Trump had inherited about $40 million from his late father, real estate developer Fred Trump.  According to website CelebrityNetWorth.com, which tracks celebrity earnings, Trump became head of what would later be known as The Trump Organisation in 1971.  Donald Trump’s earnings and title have since helped him develop over 500 companies. The business mogul has his stake in casinos, skyscrapers, television shows, golf courses, books, merchandise and more.  Donald Trump’s businesses: In the 1970s, Trump had inked a deal with Hyatt, in the city of New York and the unprofitable Commodore Hotel beside the Grand Central Station, earning the right to renovate and rebrand the ailing hotel into the Grand Hyatt. That hotel became an instant success, making Trump one of the best-known real estate developers in the area.  In 1984, Trump completed construction on the 68-story Trump Tower, the home of The Trump Organisation. That building includes a 60-foot waterfall and, on opening day, had five levels of retail stores and restaurants known as a New York staple.  Trump has owned a number of successful businesses and properties among them Trump Place, a housing development project with 5,700 apartments across 18 buildings.  The Trump International Hotel & Tower Chicago has a hotel, condos and numerous restaurants and shops. Wollman Rink, a Central Park staple that sees more than five million visitors each year, is also owned by Trump.  Donald Trump’s failed businesses: While Trump has major business wins to his name, he has suffered losses too.  In 1988, Trump had spent $365 million on a fleet of Boeing 727s, plus landing facilities in Washington, DC, New York City and Boston. He also bought the right to paint his name on a plane. Unfortunately, his attempt to build a luxury flying experience under the Trump Shuttle name failed — and the company was decommissioned.  In 1990, the banks that backed his investments provided him with a $65 million bailout in new loans and credit, reported Time. That bailout failed, leaving Trump nearly $4 billion in debt nine months later. That same year, his famous Taj Mahal casino in Atlanta City had filed for bankruptcy.  Trump Hotels & Casino Resorts went bankrupt in 2004. In 2009, the same company — now called Trump Entertainment Resorts — filed for bankruptcy again.  One of Trump’s highest-profile business failures is Trump University. The unaccredited online college was launched in 2005 and closed down in 2010. Three Trump University lawsuits plague the Republican nominee’s campaign. Those lawsuits allege Trump University was a scam that cost students tens of thousands of dollars.  Donald Trump’s lifestyle: Trump and wife Melania Trump live in a three-floor penthouse in Trump Tower in New York. The luxuries they enjoy include an indoor fountain and a door encrusted with diamonds and gold.  Among his other properties is the private club Mar-a-Lago, which sits on 17 acres of valuable South Florida land. He bought the estate — which boasts 58 bedrooms, 33 bathrooms, 12 fireplaces and three bomb shelters — for the bargain price of $10 million in 1985. Today, it is a luxury club worth as much as $300 million.  He shuttles between campaign stops in his $100 million Boeing 757 adorned with gold seat belts. His fleet of luxury vehicles include a Rolls Royce, an electric blue 1997 Lamborghini Diablo and a Mercedes-Benz SLR McLaren.  0 0 Wealthy Trump gears up to replace financially comfortable Obama was posted in National of TheNews International - https://www.thenews.com.pk on January 20, 2017 and was last updated on January 20, 2017.
