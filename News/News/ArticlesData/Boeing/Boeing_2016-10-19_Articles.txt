Credit Suisse gave clients a list of stocks that are likely to perform best on an election victory by Hillary Clinton. With the presidential vote less than a month away, the probability that Clinton will win has significantly increased, said the firm's chief U.S. equity strategist, Lori Calvasina, citing the latest poll numbers. "Near term, the increased chance of a Clinton victory seems good for stocks with high international exposure and industrials," she said, explaining that both sectors have closely traded in tandem with the direction of Clinton's polling numbers.

The service marks the first U.S. nonstop destination for Xiamen. Today’s announcement marks Sea-Tac Airport’s 15th new international destination in the past 10 years. Today’s celebration included a ribbon cutting and toast to the airline, which features 787-8 service to Sea-Tac Airport. Xiamen has a special connection to the Pacific Northwest since it flies an all-Boeing fleet.  The new service increases the strong business and community ties between Seattle and Shenzhen, one of China’s largest cities. “Sea-Tac Airport is one of the most connected gateways to Asia and it is an honor that Xiamen chose Seattle to launch its U.S. service,” said Port of Seattle Commissioner Fred Felleman. “Shenzhen is known as the ‘Silicon Valley’ of China and this new destination will be a tremendous opportunity for both business and leisure travelers to experience our shared values. We commend Xiamen for using the state-of-the-art Boeing 787, which furthers the Port of Seattle’s goals of being the greenest and most energy efficient port while advancing our region as a business and tourism hub.” The service begins in the city of Xiamen (headquarters to Xiamen Airlines), then shuttle to Shenzhen before making the nonstop flight to Seattle. Xiamen operates the largest all-Boeing fleet in China and will serve the route three times per week (Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays) with 787-8 aircraft. "The launch of the Xiamen-Shenzhen-Seattle service is an important reflection of the results of the meeting between Chinese and American leaders,” said Xiamen Airlines chairman and general manager Che Shanglun. “On the heels of these events, a Fuzhou-New York and a Xiamen-LA service will also be initiated, making air travel, and, by consequence, exchanges between the two countries much easier." Sea-Tac Airport has been the fastest growing large hub airport in the U.S. for the past two years. In 2015, passenger traffic set a record for the fifth straight year with over 42.3 million travelers. Through the third quarter of 2016, passenger totals are up nine percent. Earlier this year Sea-Tac Airport welcomed new international service from Volaris Airlines to Guadalajara, Mexico and Condor Airlines announced new service to Munich, Germany starting in 2017. Flight details for Seattle-Xiamen-Shenzhen service (Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays): Flight MF845 departs XMN at 9:30a.m. and arrives to SZX at 10:45a.m.; leaves SZX at 12:45p.m. and arrives to SEA at 10:25 a.m. Flight MF546 departs SEA at 1:25p.m. and arrives to SZX 6:15p.m. (next day); leaves SZX ar 8:15p.m. and arrives to XMN 9:25 p.m. About Xiamen Airlines Founded in July 1984, Xiamen Airlines is a unique and premium airline in China.

2016, 07:30 ET Share this article ENGLEWOOD, Colo., Oct. 20, 2016 /PRNewswire/-- Jeppesen, a Boeing Company, has worked closely with the pilot community and leading experts to enhance its SID (standard instrument departure) and STAR (standard terminal arrival route) charts to increase situational awareness and reduce 'head-down' time while referencing chart information. "Over the past two years, we have teamed with pilots and experts in human factors to create a new industry standard with Jeppesen SID/STAR chart design and interaction," said Mike Abbott, director, Jeppesen Data Solutions Product & Portfolio Management. "This significant change to our charts make them easier to read, reduces the likelihood of violating altitude and speed restrictions and improves the user experience with both mobile and installed electronic flight bag (EFB) platforms." The new worldwide IFR (instrument flight rules) charts will be introduced over time, starting this December for airports in Europe and the U.S. The chart enhancements are designed to help pilots increase safety in flight and raise awareness of both physical obstacles and dangers and the regulatory environment for each procedure. Specifically, key enhancements made to Jeppesen IFR arrival and departure charts include the addition of terrain, distinctive use of color to identify important features at a glance and true to scale depiction of chart elements. The new chart design features blue coding of altitude and magenta coloring of speed restriction details, to simplify recognition of essential arrival and departure elements.  Overall, 10 enhancements will be included in the new Jeppesen charts, including the addition of MSAs (minimum sector altitudes) within the plan view of the chart to provide a minimum clearance of objects near the airport and grid MORAs (minimum off route altitudes), providing obstacle clearance altitude within a certain longitude and latitude grid on the chart. Jeppesen charts are derived from a comprehensive aviation database that contains more than one million records, and employs multiple stages to assure quality. Jeppesen continually takes in "source" data collected from the world's more than 220 Air Navigation Service Providers and refines and synthesizes the widely varying forms of critical data into a singular chart format. Jeppesen flight information analysts edit and verify thousands of database transactions during each International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) 28-day revision cycle.

By Will Ashworth, InvestorPlace Contributor  |  Oct 20, 2016, 6:30 am EST     Popular Posts: 7 S&P 500 Stocks That Will Be Knocked Back Down to Earth 3 Reasons Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Still Is a Great Buy 7 Stocks to Buy That Will Grow by Double Digits Recent Posts: Whole Foods Market, Inc. (WFM) Stock Has Only One Chance At Survival 3 Reasons Why Netflix, Inc. (NFLX) Stock Is Worth Its Insane Valuation 3 Reasons Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Still Is a Great Buy View All Posts “I’m convinced that the first person to step foot on Mars will arrive there riding on a Boeing rocket,” Boeing Co (NYSE:BA) CEO Dennis Muilenburg recently said at the What’s Next Tech Conference in Chicago. With that one sentence, Muilenburg set off a massive debate about space colonization and who’s going to get us there first — it also more eyes on Boeing stock. Source: Wikimedia SpaceX CEO Elon Musk feels his company is best equipped to make that happen; BA feels otherwise. If you look at how each company is funding their Mars adventures, Muilenburg is right to feel this way. Boeing is being supplied with billions of dollars from NASA to build a next-generation rocket dubbed the Space Launch System that will get the Orion spacecraft to Mars sometime around 2035. SpaceX is self-funded, currently contributing about 5% of its resources to the Mars rockets and spaceships. It’s projecting a Mars mission by 2024, well ahead of Boeing’s plans. There’s only one problem with SpaceX’s current spending and future plans: the Mars mission is estimated to cost as much as $1.5 trillion. 7 Tech Stocks That Will Ride Healthcare to Riches Where is it going to get the money to pay for it? Musk has been able to woo NASA into becoming an investor in SpaceX itself. Perhaps they will fork over additional billions to Musk (as they’ve done with Boeing) playing both sides against the middle. BA Has the Upper Hand However, where we stand today, is that BA is the one with the contracts, not SpaceX. So, from that perspective, they’re ahead of the game at least when it comes to NASA. If you want to get to Mars you’re going to need them on your side. But enough of the space talk. Putting all these hypotheticals aside, what does all of this mean for the current BA stock holder? Very little. Yes, it has contracts that were signed in 2014 regarding the SLS worth $3 billion that are ongoing through 2021; in the seven years prior to signing those contracts it also received an estimated $1.66 billion for preliminary work on the rocket. That’s almost $5 billion received before the project is even remotely close to completion. There will be more contracts and many more billions of dollars leading up to 2035. But you have to take that in the context of the entire BA business. In the first six months of 2016, Boeing generated $3 billion in free cash flow from $47.4 billion in revenue. Its backlog is $472 billion with nearly 5,700 commercial airplane orders. The SLS is practically a rounding error. However, if you drill down into its Defense, Space & Security segment, you’ll get a better idea why a little long-term thinking vis-a-vis the SLS makes a whole lot of sense. Space Exploration is housed within the Network & Space Systems division, which itself is one of three divisions that make up Boeing’s DS&S segment. In the first half of the year, N&SS generated operating earnings of $301 million on $3.5 billion in revenue. Normally, that’s about 8% to 10% of the company’s overall revenue. Over the last two fiscal years, its operating margins have increased by 100 basis points to 9.4%. In 2015, NS&S had $7.8 billion in revenue, $726 million in earnings from operations, and a $7.4 billion contractual backlog. That’s about 20% of the backlog of its other two divisions — Boeing Military Aircraft and Global Services & Support — combined. When you add to this the fact NS&S has the smallest margins of the three divisions, you can’t help but fail to notice the possibilities Boeing stock provides. Bottom Line on Boeing Stock However, put your Warren Buffett cap on for a moment, and we’ve got the makings of a very good long-term hold in BA stock. Let’s say Boeing does get a rocket and spaceship to Mars by 2035 and humans can actually withstand the radiation on the planet. Then what? Obviously, at some point, NASA and/or other space agencies are going to begin the initial stages of colonization. It could take another 100 years after that before we see something resembling a city or town. How Far Can Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Really Go With the Cloud? That’s obviously too long-term for anyone currently alive. However, that doesn’t mean BA investors can’t pass Boeing stock on to their kids and grandkids as a keepsake. More importantly, unlike the early car pioneers such as Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F), BA stock investors already get a company that’s nicely profitable. Space colonization is coming. Why not ride Boeing stock all the way to the finish line? As of this writing, Will Ashworth did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Nehanda Radio Home News Politics Business Opinion Bizarre Courts Local Diaspora World Showbiz Sports Home News Mugabe scouts for new planes News Politics Popular Mugabe scouts for new planes Oct 20, 2016 29 6387 By Shame Makoshori The country’s beleaguered airline, Air Zimbabwe (AirZim), is scouting for modern passenger aircraft and has initiated negotiations for the lease of Boeing 787 Dreamliner planes from a Malaysian airline, the Financial Gazette has learnt. President Robert Mugabe (Picture by (TSVANGIRAYI MUKWAZHI/AP) The Boeing 787 Dreamliner is an American long-haul, mid-size wide body, twin-engine jet airliner manufactured by Boeing Commercial Airplanes. The current search, which comes hard on the heels of top-level appointments at the national airline, will include a determination of lucrative routes to ensure the viability of any new plane acquisitions. But there were indications the airline would avoid European capitals due to outstanding aviation debts that once resulted in the seizure of an AirZim plane in London, forcing the parastatal to terminate flights to the country’s former colonial master, Britain. President Robert Mugabe visited Malaysia, the south-east Asian country, a fortnight ago and was accompanied by the Minister of Transport, Communication and Infrastructure Development, Joram Gumbo, ministry officials, a team of aviation experts and AirZim’s top management. Gumbo confirmed this week that he had accompanied President Mugabe to Malaysia to explore aviation opportunities. He told the Financial Gazette that government, which wholly owns the national flag carrier, was looking for long haul planes. The airline has already started talks with “technical partners”, whom Gumbo declined to name, although he disclosed that they were currently exploring routes to determine those that were likely to be lucrative to fly the new planes. “After the discussions that we are having with technical partners, we will have long haul planes. It does not help us to receive planes and keep them at the Harare International Airport without routes. I am trying to scout for routes for Air Zimbabwe. That is why I went to Malaysia. I went to see Air Malaysia to see how they operate. I will also be visiting China and Singapore to see if Air Zimbabwe can connect through these routes to China. I also want to go to Nigeria to see if we can have direct flights to West Africa,” said Gumbo. The frantic efforts to secure new planes and routes come a month after the airline appointed Ripton Muzenda, son of the late vice president Simon Muzenda, as chief executive officer (CEO), while President Mugabe’s son-in-law, Simbarashe Chikore, was appointed chief operating officer. The two are understood to have been asked to turnaround the loss-making airline and are reportedly at the centre of ongoing moves to secure planes. AirZim, which has gone through turbulent times since dollarisation in 2009, is struggling to match competition from established airlines due to the old aircraft within its fleet. Passenger numbers have plummeted to about 230 000 per annum in the past few years, from a peak of one million in 1996, as travellers opt for other airlines on the four domestic destinations it services. The airline, currently flying into South Africa, Zambia and Tanzania, has been planning to re-launch the cash-spinning Harare-London flights, but airline executives have warned that without modern jetliners, it would be a waste of time because it would most certainly face passenger resistance. AirZim’s aged fleet comprises two Boeing 767s, three 737s, three MA60s and two Airbus A320s. Out of these planes, only four are flying – one airbus, one Boeing 767, one 737 and an MA60. Airline executives have been pushing for the acquisition or lease of a Dreamliner for its long haul flights, whose network will include China, Malaysia, and possibly Singapore. The airline came close to liquidation when it stopped flights in 2011 before its sole shareholder took the decision to resume operation in November 2012. Last month, Gumbo held informal discussions with Ethiopian Airways (ET) executives in Addis Ababa with the hope of entering into a technical partnership. At the ET discussions, Gumbo travelled with most of his senior officials including permanent secretary, Munesu Munodawafa, director of legal affairs, Angela Karonga, his personal assistant, an official from the Ministry of Finance, Civil Aviation Authority of Zimbabwe general manager, David Chaota, AirZim deputy chairman, Pathias Chironga and Muzenda. The Zimbabwean delegation was, however, said to have been unhappy after a low level team led by the ET CEO was assigned to talk to them. In terms of protocol, Gumbo was supposed to meet a ministerial team. Government officials aware of the talks said after some of ET’s proposals turned out to be unfavourable, authorities were no longer keen to pursue the deal. “They (ET) had their conditions,” Gumbo told the Financial Gazette. “Some of them may have been favourable, some of them were not. I am yet to discuss with them officially because I have not been given the authority. There is a vetting process that is going on,” the Minister added. Sources, however, said the unfavourable conditions in Ethiopia may have caused the President to shift to Asia. “The objective was to look at some of the available aircraft, but it would appear they were snubbed in Ethiopia. It was clear that our team was desperate to clinch the deal and the Ethiopians may have wanted to take advantage. “In my own opinion President Mugabe is too proud to play second fiddle to another African nation. “Hence the option being considered now for which a team travelled to Malaysia,” said the well-placed government source. “AirZim needs a Dreamliner. It is cheaper to operate and technologically advanced. Both Kenya Airways and Ethiopian Airways are already operating the equipment. We need it for London for us to be able to compete with the likes of Emirates. Regionally and domestically, we need an aircraft like Embraer (70-100) or Bombardier,” the official said. The 60-seater Embraer, manufactured in Brazil, was briefly operated by AirZim on domestic and regional flights under a lease agreement three years ago. The Financial Gazette understands that during the recent trip to Malaysia, Gumbo and his team discussed several options with Malaysian government officials and the private sector to find how AirZim could be revived. This week, Muzenda said government would be in a better position to comment on the negotiations taking place. “If there are any discussions, they will be taking place at government level. (Government) will be in a better position to tell you. We are just working flat out to sort out the airline, that’s all,” said Muzenda. Government has not been keen to enter a deal in which it ends up relinquishing majority control in the national flag carrier. In 2013, British multi-millionaire, Nicholas van Hoogstraten, proposed a transaction which would have seen him availing an undisclosed sum to the flag carrier for aircraft acquisitions and repayment of debts in Europe. The move was meant to facilitate the re-launch of flights on the Harare-London route. The property magnate, a significant shareholder alongside government in Zimbabwe Stock Exchange-listed Hwange Colliery Company Limited and listed-hotel chain, Rainbow Tourism Group, had agreed to a proposal by the AirZim board, but had made several conditions, which the board turned down. If the board, and consequently government, had agreed to the deal with van Hoogstraten, the British tycoon would immediately have injected up to US$15 million in working capital for the resumption of the Harare-London flights. AirZim was expected to deploy the cash to settle an overdraft facility estimated at about US$2,5 million then and channel at least US$3 million towards unpaid landing debts in London. Van Hoogstraten had agreed to purchase two new Boeing 777 aircraft for the Harare-London flights and proposed that AirZim reconfigures the route to include Johannesburg. But the AirZim board, then led by Ozias Bvute, was supposed to agree to conditions proposed by van Hoogstraten, which included the formation of a new company in London, fully controlled by the British businessman that would manage the flights.  The transaction was turned down.

During Rhodesia agriculture was at the top of the scale .We were the bread basket of Africa producing all the primary inputs for the myriad of industries and also enough to feed ourselves . Second to that sector was mining with minerals like iron ,coal, gold ,asbestos and many others also contributing . All Mugabe needs to do is to focus on these sectors again with the first step being to make it attractive for investors to return to those sectors . Unlock the potential of the country by re-looking at the land tenure policy . Offer the now unproductive land to real farmers kwete zvenyu zvemahumbwe zvamurikuita . 90 percent of farmlands are derelict with no farming activity taking place . Now you are looking for aircraft to lease when your people are starving . Simply because you have put Simba ikoko?Just look at how you are abusing this airline ? Mugufuli travels in economy class with his people but iwewe who leads one of the poorest countries in the world are commandeering a presidential jet further escalating the losses that AirZimbabwe is making . How many Zimbabweans have written,talked to you and advised you about solutions to revive the dying economy ? The problem is that we have a president who just doesn’t care about his people and is the wrong person for the job. Very sad .

H eis trying to keep pace with ziHure rava Gire, competing with the young Gonos and Makambas Avi8r One of the fundamental reasons why the delegation that went to meet the Ethiopian Airlines officials met with “non-protocol” so called “low level” officials is simple and plain – Most progressive countries treat their flag carrier airlines as independent businesses! They’re no different from a soap manufacturing company seeking trade partnerships – I see now Gumbo is oblivious to this. His involvement in such low level technical meetings is indicative of systemic regressive thinking in his ministry and the airline itself. Send the right people for the job, there was no need for an entourage, something the Ethiopians are fully aware of thus sent only the relevant representation for this meeting.

The airplane is expected to start servicing its route in the next three weeks. This is if what government’s wishes are anything to go by. The 149-seater aircraft, which is managed by Swazi Airways, arrived in the country last week Thursday via King Mswati III International Airport (KMIII) and was produced by American manufacturers, Boeing Commercial Airlines. It is currently parked at KMIII. In an interview yesterday, Minister of Public Works and Transport Lindiwe Dlamini said there will be a test flight of the aircraft to Cape Town. The test flight will be undertaken by a trained crew and will be leaving KMIII at 10am. She said government, together with Swazi Airways, are currently in the final stages of the certification of the aircraft before it can embark on its maiden flight. The certification process is being undertaken by the Swaziland Civil Aviation Authority (SWACAA) in line with regulations provided by the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO). In terms of international laws, the aircraft cannot take to the skies until it acquires what is known as the Air Operators Certificate (AOC). Minister Dlamini said the process of certification started long before the plane even arrived in the country and she was hopeful that it would be completed very soon.  “Once the certification process has been completed, the aircraft will commence its daily flight routine,” said the minister. However, independent observers seem not to agree with the minister. An informed expert who spoke to this newspaper yesterday said he was not convinced that the aircraft would undertake its maiden flight in the next three weeks as per the minister’s assertions.  He said certification of an aircraft was a long and complicated process. He said in his view, obtaining the Air Operators Certificate (AOC) for the new Swazi Airways plane would not be happening anytime soon. The civil aviation expert said there was still a lot that needed to be done before the certificate could be obtained. : del.icio.us | Digg Comments (0 posted): Post your comment Your name: Your e-mail address: Add your comments:  Please enter the code you see in the image: Image: Code: Most Popular Most E-mailed ‘I AND THOU’ IDS TO HAVE EXPIRY DATES GOVT STARTS PROCESS OF PAYING OWED SUPPLIERS SWAZIMED DIRECTORS CHALLENGE PETER SIMELANE’S APPOINTMENT NGWANE PARK HIGH PUPIL STABBED AT SCHOOL GATE ‘I AND THOU’ IDS TO HAVE EXPIRY DATES GOVT STARTS PROCESS OF PAYING OWED SUPPLIERS SWAZIMED DIRECTORS CHALLENGE PETER SIMELANE’S APPOINTMENT NGWANE PARK HIGH PUPIL STABBED AT SCHOOL GATE Most Commented Latest comments COLANI VILAKATI on 19/05/2016 07:25:09 GUYS TANKS FOR THE LATEST UPDATES ON OUR SOCCER LIFE.

On Sept. 24, three days after the licenses were issued, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif confirmed that Iran had received the green light to purchase 80 out of the 88 aircraft it had sought to buy from Boeing, adding, “Out of 118 Airbus jetliners, the license for selling 17 has been issued.” Summary⎙ Print Beyond being the first major aircraft sales with Iran in decades, the Boeing and Airbus deals are groundbreaking because they may entice major Western banks to resume dealings with the Islamic Republic. Author Saheb Sadeghi Posted October 19, 2016 Airbus and Boeing had previously agreed to sell or lease more than 200 passenger planes to Iran, which has sought to revamp its aging air fleet after the signing of the July 14, 2015, Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). After the formal Jan. 16 Implementation Day of the nuclear deal, the US Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) issued documents declaring that all US institutions wishing to sell or lease aircraft, spare parts or maintenance and safety services to Iran could apply for licenses on a case-by-case basis. OFAC guidelines further stipulated that non-US institutions also need licenses for selling and leasing aircraft to Iran if more than 10% of the components of their products are American made. Beyond the issue of securing licenses to sell the aircraft is the challenge of financing the deals. Hinting at this problem, Zarif told the Council on Foreign Relations in New York Sept. 23, “The US Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control … tells international banks that it’s OK to do business with Iran but — and the buts and ifs are so long — I mean there is one sentence that it is OK to do business with Iran and five pages of ifs and buts. So at the end of the day, these banks say we will take the safe road. We will forget about Iran. And that has been the outcome. No major European bank has started doing business with Iran now, eight months after the deal. And we believe that’s a shortcoming.” According to what has been reported so far, the Boeing and Airbus passenger planes are not going to be bought in cash but rather financed. In practice, this means that Iran will buy the aircraft with loans and will repay the debt through revenue generated from operating the planes. Thus, not only is a bank or other financial institution needed to make the deal happen, but the loans must be long term. The broader implication is that if Iran is able to purchase aircraft through external financing, it could also do so with regard to other projects. While negotiations to finalize the aircraft deals are still ongoing, Iranian officials say they have made good progress. Indeed, things appear to be particularly moving forward on the crucial issue of financing. On Oct. 14, Tasnim news agency quoted a source in the Iranian government as saying, “Boeing and an American bank are reaching an agreement to finance Iranian purchase of the airliners through a Japanese bank.” Prior reports said that issues related to financing of the Airbus deal had also been solved. On Sept. 24, Iranian Deputy Minister of Roads and Urban Development Asghar Fakhrieh Kashan told the Iran newspaper, “A financing agreement between Airbus and a big financial institution has been finalized that has remained a secret in order to avert some enemies’ plots.” Some experts are of the view that the OFAC licenses to Boeing and Airbus are a promising sign that serious banking cooperation between Iran and Europe is around the corner. This would be an important development since major European banks have remained wary of remaining US sanctions and thus refrained from resuming banking ties with Iran — even after the formal implementation of the nuclear deal. As such, Tehran has so far relied on cooperation with smaller European banks while continuing dialogue with the bigger ones. Given the scale of the Boeing and Airbus deals and the need for financing to be long term, it is evident that small banks will not be able to finance the contracts. One can thus expect that major players are involved in the financing, and that the deals may help jump-start business between Iran and major Western banks in the near future. Indeed, beyond authorizing two major deals, OFAC’s licensing of aircraft sales to Iran is giving assurance to the world's major businesses that it is now possible to resume dealings with the Islamic Republic. Prominent Tehran economist​ Saeed Leylaz told Al-Monitor, “The OFAC licenses will have a big psychological impact on major investors and financial enterprises. This matters especially because under immense pressure from Iran and Its European trading partners, the United States now has to abide by its obligations under the JCPOA.” Leylaz added, “Serious cracks have emerged in the most complex and oldest sanctions and this will impact non-nuclear sanctions as well. In as much as Boeing is one of the biggest financial enterprises in the world and the United States, its financial transactions with different US economic sectors will spread to other sectors.” Al-Monitor also spoke with Tehran-based economist Tahmasb Mazaheri. He agreed that OFAC’s granting of licenses to Boeing and Airbus to deal with Iran is a good sign of the full implementation of the nuclear deal — but argued that the United States has only facilitated the latter after having in effect been forced to do so. Pointing to Iran’s deep and lingering mistrust of the United States, Mazaheri added, “Despite this good sign, we cannot trust the United States to fulfill its promises because in order to be assured of these promises, they must be credible — but the United States is not trustworthy. The United States has so far shown that it doesn’t want to fully implement the JCPOA and its acceptance of its obligations has always been accompanied with strict conditions.”  Read More: http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2016/10/iran-airbus-boeing-deals-ofac-licenses-western-banks.html Saheb Sadeghi Contributor,  Iran Pulse Saheb Sadeghi, a columnist and political analyst, is currently the managing director of the Iranian magazine Diplomat, a monthly publication that specializes in foreign policy issues, and director of economic service at the newspaper Iran Daily.

The study by Doyletech Corporation, a Canadian strategic management consultancy, suggests that Boeing’s four locations in Canada include Winnipeg, Richmond, Montreal and Ottawa both directly and indirectly create positive economic effects. The aerospace company supports more than 17,000 jobs across the country and contributes to nearly 14 percent of Canada’s aerospace industry. “Boeing has been a strong partner to Canada since 1919, and these results demonstrate the significant continued economic benefits to Canada from Boeing’s long-term commitments and collaboration with Canada’s aerospace industry,” said Maria Lane, Defense Space & Security vice president of International Strategic Partnerships. “This study helps to quantify Boeing’s impact for Canadian industry. Looking ahead, we are committed to growing our partnership with Canada, supporting local jobs and growth across the country.” The study found that Boeing’s spending in Canada has grown at an average annual rate of nearly eight percent, four times as much as the Canadian economy’s growth rate. Boeing will contribute more than US$10 million this year toward the Canadian government’s objectives in science, technology, economic evolution and growth at the province level. Doyletech explored three different areas where Boeing contributes to the Canadian economy. The three areas include Boeing as an “Agile Producer,” direct and indirect contributions to Canada’s science policy and national science and technology objectives through Doyletech’s EconWin economic impact model; and estimated direct, indirect and induced spending and jobs related to Boeing operations and supply chain in Canada. “Working with a country is about more than selling aircraft. It’s about creating measurable long-term partnerships across government, industry, research centers and the community,” said Roberto Valla, Defense, Space & Security vice president for Global Sales for Canada. For Valla, the study suggests that collaboration between Boeing and Canadian industry can produce widespread, mutual economic benefit and technological growth for decades. The study will support Boeing’s development of a tailored industrial engagement plan, through Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada, related to its offering of the F/A-18 Super Hornet fighter jet to Canada. www.boeing.ca Share Tweet Facebook LinkedIn Google+ Tags Boeing Winnipeg Related Canadian aerospace market overcomes “disappointing global economy” Study: How to help Canadian startups become billion dollar firms Boeing, Airbus offer positive outlook for aircraft demand Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

A four-year agreement to this effect was signed between the Australian Department of Defence and Boeing. The deal to support P-8A Poseidon maritime patrol and response aircraft is expected to create more than 35 jobs in South Australia. Australia's Minister of Defence Industry Christopher Pyne said: “This contract continues to deliver on the Turnbull Government’s commitment to using Australia’s defence expenditure to the benefit of both Australia’s national security interests and the economic health of this important employment sector. “Developing this kind of indigenous capability, where we can maintain our own military hardware, is critical for our national security and is good for Australian jobs.” In September this year, Boeing launched the first P-8A Poseidon aircraft for RAAF. Based on Boeing’s 737-800 fuselage, the new maritime patrol aircraft will replace a fleet of AP-3C Orion aircraft currently in service with RAAF. "The P-8A is a world class Maritime Patrol and Response aircraft and Australian Defence industry support will be a critical enabler to our military’s operational capability in the region." The P-8A is equipped with weapons bay, under wing and under fuselage hard points for weapons and is designed for continued low level operations and high angle of bank turns. Pyne further added: “The P-8A is a world class Maritime Patrol and Response aircraft and Australian Defence industry support will be a critical enabler to our military’s operational capability in the region.” “Importantly Australian defence industry involvement in the sustainment of this aircraft will provide regional support for the global P-8A fleet and has the potential to improve opportunities for Australian defence industry participation in future support activities.” Image: A P-8A Poseidon flying alongside a Lockheed P-3 Orion.

  Wednesday 16/11/2016     Product Focus    Print this page Kennametal, KM4X: A new twist on an old ally in the setup-time reduction war 19 October 2016 Quick-change modular tooling is a clear way to increase productivity, shorten setup time, and generally improve the bottom line for job shops and large manufacturers alike. The KM™ system from Kennametal Corp., Latrobe, PA has been a top performer in this area for over three decades, and is known throughout the industry for its high clamping strength and consistent accuracy in both spindle-mounted and static tooling applications.The bending moment of KM4X is substantially higher than any tooling interface available on the market today, superior even to Kennametal's own KM design So when aerospace giant Boeing came to Kennametal with a request for a heavy-duty spindle connection capable of outperforming traditional CAT and BT-style adapters, tooling engineers turned to this robust and well-established platform as a starting point. The result was a 100 mm spindle connection with four ball tracks instead of two and up to 40 percent greater clamping force than comparably-sized KM tooling.  That was 15 years ago. KM continues to thrive, and was adopted in 2008 by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) as ISO standard 26622. The original Boeing-inspired design has been renamed as well, and marketed for the past several years as KM4X100™, a spindle platform popular with machine builders such as Fives Group, Mitsui Seiki, Stama, and others, as well as those machine shops looking for superior rigidity in demanding machining conditions. That popularity is about to grow. Kennametal has announced the KM4X tooling family has gained a 63 mm sibling, one aimed at a broader machine tool platform and therefore greater availability to the machining community. "Just as we did with Boeing, we challenged ourselves to make a great solution even better," says Bill Redman, Kennametal Global Product Manager, Tooling Systems. "The clamping strength, bending stiffness, and RPM capabilities of the KM4X63™ are dramatically higher than virtually any other connection out there." Redman and others on the product management and engineering team aren't done. They recently approached a number of machine builders to ask for opinions on the initial KM4X product offering. Based on that feedback, Kennametal continues to expand the portfolio—the KM4X lineup now includes shrink fit toolholders, HydroForce™ hydraulic chucks, TG and ER collet chucks, and a variety of other spindle tooling, clamping units, and modular adapters, with more on the way.  »By the end of 2016, we're going to add roughly 30 new line items, most of which will be extensions in the 80 to 200 mm range, and centerline turning tools to support mill-turn applications,» says Redman. "We've found that, because of KM4X's extreme rigidity, we can greatly increase gage lengths. This means our customers can reach much farther without having to buy a special tool, something that's especially important with 5-axis machining—they can basically add on whatever extension length is needed and off they go, in both static or rotating applications. We're pretty excited about that." One example of this is a 674 mm gage length (26.54 in.) KM4X boring bar that will be displayed on an Integrex i-400 in the Mazak booth at this year's IMTS. "KM4X63 has a maximum bending moment of 2,100 Nm (1548 ft. lb.) and, depending on the machine, clamping force of 36 to 58 Kn (8093 to 13038 lb.)," he says. "It's the strongest connection available in this size range, period." It's also faster. Redman says KM4X63 comes 'out of the box' capable to 38,000 rpm, which is higher than HSK-A and 'dramatically' faster than competing brands of spindle tooling. For those shops on the fence about spindle tooling and quick-change, Redman offers the following advice. "There's nothing worse than going into a shop that just bought a $500,000 machining center or lathe and then discovers they should have opted for a different tooling platform. We as tooling providers have an obligation to educate customers, and get them thinking about what they're trying to accomplish—whether they need high spindle speeds for an aluminum or die-mold application, or greater low-end torque for titanium and HRSA machining. The majority of tooling systems out there can accommodate one of these things, but not both. We feel KM4X provides a competitive advantage no matter what you're cutting." KM and KM4X work on stationary applications as well, as in this centerline turning tool holder for multi-tasking machines and mill-turn lathes Due to its inherently balanced design, KM4X63 achieves 'out of the box' spindle speeds 30% greater than HSK, and nearly twice that of comparably-sized polygon-style toolholders Anatomy of the KM4X clamping mechanism: four ball tracks instead of two. On the system size 63, this provides 50% greater clamping force over PSC, and 150% higher clamping force than HSK63   For more information, please contact: Anna Mason Kennametal U.K. Ltd.

"Airbus and Boeing have given the Iranian aviation industry the rights for plane maintenance and repair operations as well as manufacture of airplane spare parts," Member of Iranian Aviation Companies Association Maqsoud Assadi Samani said on Tuesday. He said that the negotiations with Airbus and Boeing authorities had been underway with satisfactory pace. In mid-September, Deputy Managing Director of Boeing Company Martin Benturd underlined that the sales of the giant aviation firm's airplanes to Iran is on the right track. "There is no problem for selling airplanes to Iran and conditions are ripe for obtaining license from Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC)," Benturd told reporters in Ashgabat. He underlined that Boeing and the Iranian airliners are continuing their talks on the sale of passenger planes. OFAC is a financial intelligence and enforcement agency of the US Treasury Department. In mid-June, Head of Iran’s Civil Aviation Organization (CAO) and Deputy Road Minister Ali Abedzadeh announced that the country has signed a deal with Boeing on purchasing 100 planes from the US manufacturer. "The two sides reached a written agreement to purchase 100 planes," Abedzadeh said. He said that the written agreement was made after representatives of Iran and Boeing company held several rounds of talks, adding that the planes will be provided to Tehran through a financing deal.         Related News Iran, Airbus to Discuss Passenger Planes Deal Again Today  Official Says 10 Airbus Planes to Be Purchased  Official: Iran to Finalize Contract to Purchase Airbus, ATR Planes Soon  Official: German, French Banks to Finance Iran's Purchase of Airbus, ATR Planes  Official: Iran-Airbus Deal to Take Time to Materialize  French Minister: Iran, Airbus to Finalize Deal Next Week  Minister: Iran, Airbus Finalizing Plane Purchase Contract  LATEST STORIES (4) Iraqi Popular Forces Continue Operations against ISIL Terrorists West of Mosul Iraqi Forces Take Back Ancient City of Nimrud from ISIL Iraqi Popular Forces Safeguarding Peace in Newly Gained Territories near Mosul Police Violence during Anti-Trump Protests Iran and US: A Tale of Two Elections Supermoon in Iran's Sky Iran Eyeing NITC Listing in Int'l Stock Markets VP: World Admitting Iran's Constructive Role in Maintaining Regional Security Iraqi Interior Minister: Nearly 1,000 ISIL Terrorists Killed, Over 100 Captured in Mosul Operation Battle for Mosul Day 29: Iraqi Forces Only 3km from Mosul Airport Kurdish Fighters Seize over 550 sq/km of Raqqa from ISIL Iraqi Police Confirm Liberation of Entire Area South of Mosul City Iraq: ISIL Hits Nineveh's Al-Qayyara Town with Chemical Missiles Protests, Students Walkouts Mark Week after Trump's Win 17 Arrested Protesting at US Senator's Office Iraqi Popular Forces Continue Operations against ISIL Terrorists West of Mosul TEHRAN (FNA)- The Iraqi volunteer forces in a statement announced that Hashd al-Shaabi continued its advances further on the second day of the third phase of the military operations in areas to the West of Mosul.

Will F-16s be made in India? October 20, 2016 10:45 IST Lockheed Martin's offer involves transferring the world's only F-16 production line from Fort Worth, Texas, to India. Thereafter, every F-16 built, and a large share of the spare parts and sub-systems for every F-16 flying across the globe would come from India. Ajai Shukla reports. On Monday, US defence giant Lockheed Martin became the first international vendor to respond to an Indian Air Force letter, soliciting interest in building a single-engine, medium fighter aircraft in India, with full transfer of technology. "We sent our acceptance (to the IAF) earlier this week," Lockheed Martin's Randy Howard, who markets the F-16 worldwide, told Business Standard. Meanwhile, Swedish defence corporation, Saab, which was sent a similar invitation, is learnt to be finalising its acceptance. "We will definitely say 'yes'; most likely by the end of this month," says a Saab official. As Business Standard reported on October 8, the IAF sent out letters last week to top global aerospace vendors, inviting them to build a single-engine fighter in India. Defence ministry sources confirm the Boeing company has also been approached. Unlike Lockheed Martin and Saab, which are actively marketing single-engine fighters -- the F-16 Block 70 and the Gripen E respectively -- Boeing has no single-engine fighter to offer. Instead, it has been offering its twin-engine F/A-18 E/F. Nor does Eurofighter, the European consortium that builds the twin-engine Typhoon, whose member firms also reportedly received the IAF inquiry. The contours of the 'single-engine fighter' contest are therefore emerging --- Lockheed Martin and Saab seem poised to be the only contenders. As this newspaper reported on August 16, both companies had earlier submitted what IAF boss, Air Chief Marshal Arup Raha, described as 'unsolicited offers' for building single-engine fighters in India. Now, with Lockheed Martin having responded positively to the IAF's inquiry, Saab's acceptance, when received, will formally kick off a multi-vendor acquisition process. The F-16 is amongst the older fighters still in frontline service, but Lockheed Martin describes to Business Standard an attractive offer that would make India the F-16 global hub, galvanising aerospace component fabrication in the country. The offer involves transferring the world's only F-16 production line from Fort Worth, Texas, to India. Thereafter, every F-16 built, and a large share of the spare parts and sub-systems for every F-16 flying across the globe would come from India. "Our offer is not for just building a hundred F-16s in India; or even another hundred F-16s for the export market. The real value would come from the tens of thousands of spare parts, components, sub-systems and systems that would sustain the 3,200-plus F-16s still flying in the US, and in 24 other countries," says Howard. Intriguingly, that could mean spares and expendables for Pakistan's F-16 fleet would be sourced largely from India. Lockheed Martin points out that bringing the production line to India would be "a strategic opportunity." In truth, India would have little control over the F-16 components it builds for the global F-16 fleet, including Pakistan's. Governed by a 'global F-16 sustainment programme,' the components would go into a chain of US-controlled warehouses across the globe, from where user air forces would draw their requirements. In discussions with Lockheed Martin officials, it is evident that they are concerned by the negativity in India caused by Pakistan's long association with the F-16. Yet the company is banking on an attractive business case to tamp down Indian reservations. For Lockheed Martin, shifting the F-16 line to India would be a double benefit. With the F-16 ending its prodigious production run (of 4,588 F-16s ordered over the years, just 15 remain to be delivered), Lockheed Martin now wants to build the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter at Fort Worth. Yet, an F-16 line is essential, since the US Air Force plans to operate its late-model F-16s (Block 40 and Block 50 versions) for another 30 years, till 2045. Transferring the production line to India would assure Washington that its F-16s would be reliably sustained. Howard argues that F-16 production is not yet closed. Bahrain and other West Asian countries are negotiating purchases and there are potential buyers in former Soviet countries in NATO, Indonesia and Columbia. He holds out the possibility of building these orders in India. It remains unclear how much weightage cost would have in selecting a light fighter for the IAF. Lockheed Martin is confident of offering the cheapest fighter in its class, having more than amortised its production line while building over 4,500 fighters. "Transferring the line to India will make the F-16 even cheaper. And that will bring in even more export orders," predicts Howard, optimistically. There is little clarity, however, on whether Washington or New Delhi would have the casting vote on foreign sales of F-16s built in India. It seems likely that both governments would have to concur on third-party, export sales. Lockheed Martin strongly rejects the notion that the F-16, first built in the 1970s, is obsolescent. Howard points to the Block 70's battle-proven Northrop Grumman APG-83 airborne electronically scanned array radar, a key fighter combat system. That leverages technologies developed for the F-35's fifth-generation AESA radar. "Nothing in the world compares with the experience in AESA radars that Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman bring to the table," argues Howard. To be sure, the F-16 Block 70 is a versatile combat platform. It flies faster, climbs quicker and carries more armament than most fighters in its class. The 'conformal fuel tanks' in late-version F-16s allow long-range operations. With two additional 370-gallon drop tanks and predominantly air-to-air armament, the F-16 has a combat radius of 1,500 kilometres --- comparable to the much bigger Rafale. With the heavier air-to-ground weaponry that the F-16 carries for strike missions, the radius of action is still an impressive 700 kilometres. Alongside an aggressive marketing pitch to the IAF, Lockheed Martin is also moving ahead strongly with developing vendors in India, and a supply chain that would feed into an Indian F-16 line. On November 7 and 8, a vendors' conference is planned in Bengaluru.

Joe Raedle/Getty Images Advertisement On October 13, 2016, the “Southern California Manufacturing Summit" was held at the Wedgewood Center in Aliso Viejo. The summit was hosted by the Coalition for a Prosperous America (CPA), with SDG&E/Sempra Utilities as the major sponsor, along with a long list of non-profit organizations, regional businesses and associations as sponsors and partners. The purpose of the summit was to learn and discuss how we can use Southern California's advantages to re-grow manufacturing and create good paying jobs through smarter policies on trade, taxes, and the economy. CPA is a unique alliance of manufacturing, agriculture, and labor working for smart trade policies and represents over three million households through our member associations and companies. Since nearly all of our sponsors provide services that benefit manufacturers, we modified our format from previous summits to provide opportunities for our sponsors to tell about their services to promote networking among attendees. Our first speaker was Greg Autry, adjunct professor of Entrepreneurship, Marshall School of Business, University of Southern California, who discussed “National Security Concerns with the Current U.S. Trade Regime.” Among the highlights of his presentation was his statement, “There are national security concerns with trade agreements. An economy that builds only F-35s is unsustainable – productive capacity is what wins real wars. Sophisticated systems require complex supply chains of supporting industries. They require experienced production engineers, machinists, and more.” He recently prepared a report analyzing the competition and found that we are now outsourcing most of our space-related technology. He said, "NASA awards contracts for launch vehicles to Boeing and Space X, but chose to buy Russian lower stage engines. We have to choose if we are going to have a supply chain for the space industry. We cannot rely on China to produce what we need for our military and defense systems. He added, "The International Space Station was funded by the U. S. to the tune of $100 billion of the $120 billion that it cost. We should not be relying on Russia’s Mr. Putin to launch our satellites and space vehicles and provide us a seat to get to the International Space Station.” Autry stated, "If you own stock in Alibaba, you actually own stock in a holding company in the set up in an offshore tax haven of the Cayman Islands, and the real owner behind Alibaba is the Chinese government. In contrast, he said, “It was the wealth he created at Amazon that enabled founder Jeff Bezos to now lead Blue Origin, which was selected by the United Launch Alliance to finish development of a new engine to replace the Russian made RD-180 rocket engine used by ULA’s Atlas 5 rocket.” Popular Now More 'Must Have' Metrics to Drive Continuous Improvement Trump is Right on Trade, But He Doesn’t Know Why The Internet of Things Will Make Manufacturing Smarter He pointed out that the Germans had the best technology in WWII, but didn't win because we outproduced them. Productive capacity is what wins wars. We wouldn’t be able to do the same for a future war as China has become the shop floor for too many American manufacturers. Take the U.S. F-22 airplane vs. the Chinese J20 airplane. We have 187 F-22s, and we stopped producing them because they were too expensive. China has several hundred J-20s, and they are still producing them. He warned, "China has been an aggressive nation for thousands of years – it's how the country grew from a small nation state. China has expanded their claim to territorial waters to include territory claimed by all of its immediate neighbors -- Taiwan, South Korea, Vietnam, Japan, the Philippines, Japan and even New Zealand and Australia. China's threat to these countries could eliminate getting supplies from Vietnam, Taiwan, and Korea, where companies are located that are now part of our supply chain for the military and space industry. We are going to lose our supply chain for the military and defense industry because the people in the State and Commerce Departments don't talk to the Defense Department."  After his presentation, July Lawton, president of The Lawton Group/TLC Staffing, explained that her company provides temporary to permanent staffing solutions for engineering, manufacturing, information technology, as well as the more traditional human resources, accounting, administrative, marketing, and healthcare positions. Nicholas Testa, Jr. is founder and CEO of Acuity Consulting, Inc. a firm specializing in supply chain and operations management and systems consulting and training. He is president-elect of the APICS Orange County and described the types of supply chain education and training that APICS provides to its manufacturing industry members. Economist Ian Fletcher, author of Free Trade Doesn't Work, was the next speaker. A few highlights of his presentation were: "Free trade is trade without restrictions. Economic rivalry is taking place every day. There is rivalry for wealth and power. We live in America, and it does matter where you live. America's trade deficit is averaging $500 B/year. Free trade is part of the cause of poverty, as well as family breakdowns. Free trade mostly destroys jobs. We are looking in a decline of quality rather than quantity of jobs. De-industrialization is occurring. Many major American companies are not American any longer; they are owned by foreign corporations. Boeing is losing manufacture of airplane wings to Mitsubishi. There is not a single airplane that doesn't rely on parts from other countries." He stated, "Free trade simplified means there must be something good for both parties. Free trade is only one sided by the United States because many countries practice mercantilism. Trade is being manipulated to benefit our trading partners. The Euro currency has been manipulated to reduce the value of the currency of Germany to be lower by balancing it out with the economies of France, Italy, Spain, and Greece. The U.S. is being forced to compete with the state capitalism of Europe and Asia." He added, "Free traders say that trade deficit doesn't a matter, but trade deficits mean that we consume more than we produce. David Ricardo's theory of comparative advantage did not work when it was created and doesn't work now. A nation needs some protection. Protectionism is really the American way. Alexander Hamilton was the founder of American protectionism. The U.S. had a protectionist policy until after WWII. Every country has done protectionism to succeed. He showed the following chart showing the history of tariffs in the U. S. He concluded, "After WWII, free trade became a policy because of the politics to win the Cold War. It is crumbling now because of politics. There are dangers in protectionism, but there are dangers in doing nothing. Treaties or trade agreements are basically about protecting property rights. The World Trade Organization has failed to enforce terms of current trade agreements and will not do any better with the proposed Trans Pacific Partnership Agreement."  After the morning break, I provided a brief overview of California manufacturing prior to moderating our panel of manufacturers. California is the 8th largest economy in the world, and if it were a country, it would be equal to France. California lost 33.3% of manufacturing jobs between 2000 and 2009 compared to 29.8% nationwide, and lost 25% of its manufacturing firms. I pointed out that even with its unfavorable overall business climate, California still ranks first in manufacturing for both jobs and output. However, since the Great Recession, California lags in manufacturing job growth at a 3.6% rate compared to the national 7.2% rate and a GDP growth rate in manufacturing of 11.2% in California compared to a 22.6% GDP growth in the U.S. as a whole. On the positive side, California leads the nation in R&D and number of patents issued, and California companies received $78.4 billion of VC dollars in 2015 (57% of U.S. total - up from 51% in 2010). Mexico, Canada, China, and Japan are the top four export markets for California, and California represents 11% of total U. S. exports. California ranks second behind Texas in all exports, but California ranks first among all 50 states in agricultural exports estimated at $13.6 billion per year. California is the biggest U. S. producer of nuts, dairy, ice cream, and wine. The top high tech export is computers and electronic products, which equals 26.1 % of all the state’s exports. Transportation goods are the second top export, consisting of airplanes, ships, unmanned vehicles, and underwater vehicles. Besides the good weather, Southern California's advantages are: Gateway to Pacific – two major ports – Long Beach and San Diego Major hub in western U.S. for air, rail roads & waterway transportation Skilled, educated workforce for ALL occupations Research Institutions and Universities Large inventor/entrepreneur pool Hundreds of business Incubators and Accelerators Angel investor networks Venture capital networks 18 Foreign Trade Zones Employment Training Panel funds for employee training Workforce Investment Boards There is also an abundance of business resources in Southern California, such as the California Manufacturing Technology Consulting (designated California MEP), two Centers for Applied Competitive Technologies, several Small Business Development Centers and Economic Development Agencies, as well as many Chambers of Commerce and Business Councils. I concluded with mentioning the opportunities we have to improve the California business climate, change our national tax and trade policies, return manufacturing to U.S. through reshoring, connect regional manufacturers with other U. S. suppliers, increase collaboration between manufacturers and community college to address workforce and skills gaps, and educate community/youth about career opportunities in manufacturing. After my presentation, the following three panelists shared their stories: James Hedgecock, founder and president of Bounce Composites, which designs, engineers, and manufactures high-quality, durable composite goods for multiple industries, including wind energy, automotive, aerospace, and sporting goods. He shared that the company started out producing their own patented design of stand up paddleboards, but it has been tough to compete with offshore companies because of unfair trade practice. He said it was especially difficult to export to Mexico and Europe because Value Added Taxes (VATs) are added to the price of their products, making their product more expensive. Robert Lane and Dave Mock, principals of Lane OPX, shared how they help companies optimize excellence through blending Lean Six Sigma principles, strategic business initiatives and participative management philosophies to grow organizations, and inspire high performing, motivated teams. By leveraging their deep experience in manufacturing, team dynamics, leadership development and organizational design, they have been able to power the turnaround of small to large companies.  More recently, they have been able to help manufacturers return manufacturing to America from overseas. Wei-Yung Lee, CEO of Carlsbad Technology Inc. was our final panelist. Based in Carlsbad, Calif., Lee said that Carlsbad Tech was founded 1990 and is a subsidiary of Taiwan’s leading YungShin Pharmaceutical Co. The company began as a contract manufacturer of generic pharmaceuticals and has become an industry leader in manufacturing and distribution of generics, supplements, and medical devices. He said, "We have 150 employees and 15 are well-trained chemists. We have the capacity to produce 60 million capsules and 400 million tablets per year. Last year, we launched our Comfort Vision contact lenses in the USA and have sold over 1 billion units in Asia. We are striving to become a global health bridge, bringing a world of innovative health products to the markets that need them. " After the panel, Jill Berg, president of Advanced Test Equipment Rentals, told about the products and services of her company.  They rent, lease, and sell a large selection of test and measurement equipment and other types of lab equipment to companies all over the world.  She announced that her company was hosting a San Diego Test Equipment Showcase on October 18th. Then, Chris Marocchi, field operations manager of California Manufacturing Technology Consulting (CMTC), explained that his organization is a non-profit consulting organization that just won the competition to provide Manufacturing Extension Program services for all of California. These services provide innovation and growth strategies along with operational enhancements to foster profitable growth for California companies. MEP services include:  innovate new products, open new markets, improve workforce skills, increase product quality and reduce costs through Lean training, increase energy efficiency and green production, and optimize supply chain performance. After our lunch break, I presented information on Lean Six Sigma Institute (LSSI). LSSI is a boutique-style training and consulting company that uses training and coaching model to guide companies to manage Lean Six Sigma change, develop internal leaders, and sustain the results. LSSI is headquartered in Chula Vista Calif., but has satellite offices in nine countries and employs over 60 expert consultants worldwide. Lean and six sigma principles and tools apply to virtually any process, and LSSI has successfully helped clients implement Lean Six Sigma in a variety of industries, such as manufacturing, retail, and healthcare. Our key note speaker for the summit was Michael Stumo, CEO of the Coalition for a Prosperous America, speaking on "Growing SoCal Manufacturing."  Stumo stated, "CPA is a true coalition of manufacturing, agriculture, labor, Republicans, Democrats, Progressives, Conservatives, and Independents. Our members are: Trade associations, companies, farm organizations, labor unions, and individuals from all walks of life. Our non-agriculture industries are: manufacturers, steel, tooling and machining, electronics, textiles, copper, aluminum, etc. Our mission is to balance trade and produce more in America to reclaim American prosperity." Stumo explained that there is a difference between service jobs and manufacturing jobs. According to Investopedia, "Examples of service sector jobs include housekeeping, psychotherapy, tax preparation, legal services, guided tours, nursing and teaching. There are very few "tradable" service jobs. By contrast, individuals employed in the industrial/manufacturing sector might produce goods such as cars, clothing and toys.” He said, "There is also a difference in income and purchasing power between manufacturing and service jobs. When considering what industry sectors to prioritize for workforce and economic development efforts, it is important to look beyond basic employment numbers. This is because, while a sector might have a lot of jobs, it might not actually be producing a lot of income for the region, which is also very important for overall economic health and vitality." Stumo stated, "The problem is that as more manufacturing jobs leave, more productivity leaves as well. Unlike manufacturing, service-sector jobs have strict limits in terms of productivity. For example, a live performance of Beethoven’s 5th requires the same amount of performers/employees as when it was performed early in the 19th century. Compare that with the production of almost anything manufactured — the number of workers now required to produce a bolt of fabric, for example." He added, "There is a regional ripple effect of service vs. manufacturing jobs. At $4.4 trillion in total sales, manufacturing is by far the biggest income generator in our nation, despite a fairly rapid decline in employment. Yet, manufacturing still manages to far outperform all other industries in terms of pure income creation. Manufacturing generates more income per worker and has much bigger ripple effects, creating much more impact in a region while helping to raise wages in lower-productivity service sectors." He asked the rhetorical question, "What's wrong with a service economy? He answered, "It shrinks manufacturing employment as well as the manufacturing sector’s ability to prop up wages. A labor market that loses wage pressures of high-productivity manufacturing industries will settle at wage rates lower than markets where this wage-boosting effect is present. Economic development policy makers should be careful about shunning manufacturing or other production sectors in favor of service sectors. This is a problem because 66% of U. S. workforce is without a four-year college degree." He concluded stating, "America is at a crossroads. We are losing an economic competition against other nations whose mercantilist strategies are destroying our manufacturing jobs, critical industries, and our standard of living, our national security, the security of our food supply, and our children's futures. For the U. S. to become prosperous again, our future strategy must include the following: National Priority of Balanced Trade Strong enforcement Stop new trade agreements to force a re-think. Neutralize currency manipulation Tax reform with VAT/consumption taxes Consider tariffs to neutralize imbalances We have a choice. We can continue our current trade and tax policies or we can develop and implement a comprehensive strategy that retains and reinforces our leadership in innovation, locates investment and production in the U. S. and raises employment by creating good paying jobs." As chair of the California chapter of CPA, I hope you will join our efforts to make America prosperous again.

In addition, I believe our nation needs to think like a business and act like a business. We must consider the importance of our national key competencies and define them. Then we must implement policies that create an environment that supports a national strategy that include both short term and long term goals.

On Thursday, March 3, 2016 // Ted S. Warren/AP Robots do all sorts of jobs for us these days, from vacuuming our floors to keeping us company. One giant robot, named Panel Assembly Line or PAL, sounds friendly, but its job is to construct wings for 737 airplanes. PAL sits at 20 feet tall inside a Boeing factory and helps build 42 airplanes per month, that's about two sets of wings per day  "What this line does, it builds up our upper and lower wing panels that build up our wing box on our 737 wings," said Greg Beltz, senior manager of PAL. "At the rates we're at right now, we install 44,000 fasteners a day."  This means PAL's human colleagues no longer have to clamp and rivet together wings by hand, which was a previously injury-prone task.

Air Un-fair Taxpayers pick up part of the tab when a President makes campaign trips on Air Force One, but with rare exceptions that's the only mode of air travel the President can use. David Emery Oct 18, 2016 Share - - Claim: It costs American taxpayers roughly $200,000 an hour every time President Obama travels in Air Force One to campaign for Hillary Clinton. mixture WHAT'S TRUE: Taxpayers foot part of the bill when the President uses Air Force One for campaigning purposes. WHAT'S FALSE: The true cost of operating Air Force One is likely a good deal less than $200,000 per hour, and the President is required to reimburse the government for the equivalent commercial cost of campaign travel. Example: [Collected via Facebook, September 2016] Origin:The image shown above, stating that it costs U.S. taxpayers $200,000 per hour to maintain and operate the official White House jet, Air Force One, was circulated heavily in the final months of the 2016 presidential campaign, during which President Obama made at least a dozen trips around the country to stump for fellow Democrat Hillary Clinton. It echoed a sentiment tweeted that July by Republican candidate Donald Trump, who complained that taxpayers were paying a "fortune" for Obama and Clinton to take Air Force One to North Carolina for a joint campaign appearance: Why is President Obama allowed to use Air Force One on the campaign trail with Crooked Hillary? She is flying with him tomorrow. Who pays? — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 4, 2016 Taxpayers are paying a fortune for the use of Air Force One on the campaign trail by President Obama and Crooked Hillary. A total disgrace! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 5, 2016 These are worthwhile questions to ask: How much does it really cost to operate Air Force One? And is it true that taxpayers have to foot the entire bill, even when the president isn't traveling on official business? The first question to consider is how much the use of Air Force One really costs U.S. taxpayers. The "$200,000 per hour" cost of Air Force One (or, more specifically, of the Boeing VC-25A aircraft on which the President usually travels) is a commonly cited figure, but it is both variable and highly misleading. For starters, the National Taxpayers Union Foundation (NTUF) reported in April 2016 that the cost per flight hour (CPFH) for Air Force One had decreased in the last few years: The most easily quantifiable item to estimate is the cost to operate Air Force One (AF1), a Boeing VC-25A, the military version of the 747 aircraft. Some good news for taxpayers is that the costs per flight hour for AF1 has gone down again. In 2013, it cost $228,288. Last year, it was reported at $206,337 per flight hour. In response to a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request filed by Judicial Watch, the Air Force reported that the FY 2016 cost per flight hour for the AF1 is $180,118. The main issue with this dollar figure is that it's not very informative since we don't know how much Air Force One costs when the President isn't using it. That is, cost per flight hour (CPFH) is typically determined by dividing fixed costs (or operating and support costs) by the number of hours flown — so an airplane that is very expensive to maintain but is flown relatively little (as Air Force One is) will have a high CPFH, but most of those costs will be incurred whether the aircraft is used or not. As a ridiculously simplistic example, let's suppose you own a small plane that you pay $10,000 per month (or $120,000 per year) to maintain and store in a hangar, and once per year you put $1,000 worth of fuel in that plane and fly it for an hour. Your CPFH for the year would be a whopping $121,000, even though you would have spent $120,000 of that had you never used the plane at all. Moreover, if you bought $10,000 worth of fuel and flew the plane for ten hours, your CPFH would drop all the way to $13,000 even though you actually spent more money on your airplane. Air Force One likely has a very high fixed cost because it has to be continuously maintained, inspected, secured, crewed, and prepped to fly at a moment's notice, but since it doesn't generally log a lot of flight hours (especially when compared to the typical commercial airliner), it has a relatively high CPFH — and as noted, taxpayers would be footing the bill for those hefty fixed costs whether the President flew or not. The CPFH figure is also highly misleading because if the President used Air Force One more often than he actually does, that additional usage would cause the CPFH to drop, and it would paradoxically seem as the President were saving taxpayer money by spending more of it. Whatever the true cost of the President's using Air Force One might be, how much of that cost do U.S. taxpayers bear when the purpose of the trip is political? That side of the equation is less clear. Federal Election Commission rules require that the government be reimbursed for whatever percentage of a President's trip is devoted to campaigning, based on the cost of chartering a similar-sized (or slightly smaller) commercial plane to carry campaign-related personnel on an identical trip. According to the Washington Post, that cost is currently about $11,000 per hour. We don't know exactly how much more it costs taxpayers when Air Force One is in the air rather than on the ground, but it's probably greater than $11,000 per hour (and quite a bit less than $200,000 per hour). This issue is something of an unwinnable one for a President — it's not illegal for a President to spend time campaigning, for himself or for others, but with rare exceptions the President isn't allowed to travel on any aircraft other than Air Force One. And President Obama (or his party) is already paying much more for campaign use of Air Force One than his predecessor did: prior to 2009 (when Barack Obama took office), the presidential reimbursement for political travel only amounted to a few hundred dollars per hour, so President George W. Bush paid significantly less per flight to take Air Force One on political trips than President Obama does. In the specific case of the campaign trip President Obama took with Hillary Clinton to North Carolina, official paperwork showed that the Clinton campaign reimbursed the government $36,602.99 for the use of Air Force One on 5 July 2016 — pretty close to the going rate, it sounds like, but perhaps still no bargain for the American people.

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    Boeing Co. plans to close a 35-year-old factory in Macon, Georgia, while cutting about 120 jobs. The aircraft maker blamed a softening market for big cargo planes, like the 747, for the cutbacks. The plant closure reverses a former plan to bring 200 jobs to Macon over the next three years, according to the Telegraph. “Just a year ago last month, officials from Boeing and Macon-Bibb County government celebrated the announcement that Boeing would invest nearly $82 million to convert its existing military facility in Macon to a commercial airplane manufacturing plant,” the newspaper reported. Boeing's stock has fallen about 6 percent this year, failing to re-take the 2015 peak. The Macon-Bibb Industrial Authority is working to help people find new jobs if they’re unable to transfer to other Boeing plants. “It was very disappointing to the Industrial Authority and its leadership, but we also understand that the overall economic situation impact right here at home and this is a classic example,” Macon-Bibb Industrial Authority Chairman Clifford Whitby told news station WMAZ. “There are some workers who will not wish to leave the community. So we have programs with the state and the Labor Department that’s designed to help transition workers in this case.” The Boeing site started as a McDonnell Douglas factory in 1988 that worked on commercial and military aircraft programs such as the MD-80 and the C-17, the Telegraph reported.   © 2016 Newsmax Finance.

Kevin Knight, Etihad Aviation Group’s chief strategy and planning officer, said the upgrade to the B787 Dreamliner reflected the importance of the Japan route and the airline’s commitment to the market. "The B787 Dreamliner is an exceptional aircraft from an operational and guest experience perspective. Its unique design and our innovative and stylish cabins offer a guest experience that’s superior in terms of luxury and comfort." The Abu Dhabi carrier, beginning May, was scheduled to receive five new 787 Dreamliners over a seven-month period. The fleet now serves routes including Brisbane, Washington, Singapore and Zurich from Abu Dhabi. The Dreamliner is expected to be Etihad’s flagship long-haul aircraft when it takes delivery of 66 more Boeing 787s over the next few years. Etihad Airways commenced service to Japan on February 1, 2010 with five weekly flights between Abu Dhabi and Nagoya, via Beijing, and was increased to daily four years later. Tokyo Narita was added to the Japan route on March 27, 2010 with five weekly non-stop flights, before being upgraded to a daily service on March 31, 2013. business@thenational.ae Follow The National’s Business section on Twitter Pages: Add your comment View all comments Related Etihad Airways on the lookout for new pilots in Europe Etihad launches new Dreamliner superjumbo flight to Riyadh Etihad adds flights and cities to India sector Dreamliner to provide lift for Boeing even if 777 output hits downdraught More Aviation Next-gen A380s and Boeing 777s on the way as Emirates boosts superjumbo-only fleet Delivery of 61 Boeing jetliners on hold as United looks to save $1.6bn UK’s easyJet reports first annual profit slide in six years Malaysia Airlines pins hopes on adding flights to China MOST VIEWED Business | All Next-gen A380s and Boeing 777s on the way as Emirates boosts superjumbo-only fleet Majid Al Futtaim will expand Sharjah City Centre Leonardo DiCaprio and synthetics irritate the diamond industry Stronger dollar could hold back Dubai property recovery Etihad Airways on the lookout for new pilots in Europe Rolls-Royce chief: ‘Our targets are always based on profitability, not volumes’ Review: Joyable app helps ease social anxiety at work Review: Moto Z is a brilliant modular device A380s and Boeing 777s make up Emirates’ entire fleet as it scores a world’s first More Most Viewed Album review: Hardwired...

Author: Jack Stewart. Jack Stewart Transportation Date of Publication: 10.19.16. 10.19.16 Time of Publication: 7:00 am. 7:00 am Meet the Giant Robot That Builds Boeing’s Wings To stay ahead in the war for the skies, Boeing chases a simple goal: sell as many 737 jets as it can. Things get more complicated when it comes to building most popular commercial jet ever. In 2015, the Seattle centenarian pushed an average of 42 per month out of the door and into the sky. By 2018, it aims to make that 52 a month. Faster assembly requires some fancy new tools, so Boeing brought in the robotic Panel Assembly Line, aka PAL. This 20 foot tall giant glides back and forth on tracks in the floor, patiently and accurately riveting wings together. The 60-ton machine increases production rates by 33 percent, helping workers with all that clamping and drilling. PAL, built by Washington-based Electroimpact, joins upper and lower skin panels to spars which, like ribs, form the wing’s internal support. The lower skin, which will become the bottom of the wing, has a series of “portholes” that airline mechanics use for inspections. Precision matters: These wings aren’t just keeping you aloft, they’re holding the fuel that’s pushing your plane forward. So the next time you gaze out the window of a 737, remember the helpful PAL who helped you get there. Go Back to Top. Skip To: Start of Article. Aviation Boeing Manufacturing Skip Social.

WestJet Flight 4 was headed to Toronto from London but was diverted when air traffic control and pilots deemed the plane was unsafe to fly about five hours into the flight, Winnipegger Zach Stein said. "The pilot did a great job ... he kept everybody very calm," said Stein, who was among the 250 passengers and nine crew members aboard the Boeing 767. The pilots landed at the Kangerlussuaq Airport in Greenland a short time later. A spokesperson with WestJet said the flight was grounded due to a potential mechanical issue related to the aircraft cooling system. The flight landed fine and was met by emergency vehicles as a precaution, the spokesperson added. Travellers were provided meals at the airport, and WestJet sent two Boeing 737s to Greenland Tuesday night to pick up the passengers and take them to Toronto in the morning. Stein said he was impressed with how WestJet handled the situation. "The staff did a great job, as WestJet usually [does]. They were professional, courteous, friendly, caring, answering questions." 'Nothing to do with lightning' Stein said before the flight took off, an airline attendant announced the plane was hit by a "severe lightning strike" during an earlier flight from Vancouver to London. That put people a little on edge, he said, adding no one was told whether the diversion later was related. Zach Stein was among 250 passengers temporarily stranded in Greenland Tuesday after their WestJet flight was unexpectedly grounded. (Zach Stein) But WestJet maintains "this matter had nothing to do with lightning." "That aircraft had flown from London to Vancouver the previous day, and while there had been lightning in the area around the airport when it departed [from] London, it was not hit," the spokesperson said in a statement.  "As a precaution, a comprehensive, specialized lightning inspection was performed in Vancouver yesterday after it landed and no strikes were found." WestJet plans to touch base with passengers who wish to be compensated for the delay. "We apologize to our guests for this disruption to their travel plans. Safety will always be our top priority and we will never compromise it to operate a flight," the WestJet spokesperson said. "The decision to divert was appropriate and demonstrates that commitment."

The nation’s manufacturing sector is actually booming, even if many people don’t realize it. “We don’t make our product anymore. It’s very sad,” Donald Trump said during Wednesday’s presidential debate. “We’ve given it up.” In fact, several industries are now producing record output at their U.S. plants. And foreign companies are building or expanding hundreds of plants in the United States. “We produce more today than we ever have,” said Chad Moutray, chief economist with the National Association of Manufacturers. “We made $2.1 trillion worth of products in 2015. There are sectors doing really well.” But it’s true that there are far fewer manufacturing jobs than there used to be. Employment in the sector is down nearly 40% from its 1979 peak of 19.6 million workers, according to the Labor Department. Still, manufacturing has added 800,000 U.S. jobs since 2010. While some of the lost factory jobs are due to outsourcing to foreign plants, others have been lost to automation and improved efficiency. The strength of the sector can be seen in the Federal Reserve’s inflation-adjusted measure of manufacturing, which hit a record high last year. It shows that U.S. factories are producing three to five times more output than in the early 1950s to mid-1960s, when America was the globe’s manufacturing powerhouse. For example, U.S. aircraft production is at a record high and well ahead of the rest of the world. Aerospace giant Boeing, the country’s largest exporter, started delivering 787 Dreamliners from its new plant in South Carolina in 2012. Both that factory and the company’s plants in Washington state are running at record production. Boeing delivered 768 airliners in 2015, up 163% in 10 years. Archrival Airbus delivered its first U.S.-assembled airliner from its new Alabama factory in April, and Brazilian plane maker Embraer recently moved assembly of its smallest private jets to Florida. U.S. auto production and employment has also been growing steadily since bottoming out in 2009 with the bankruptcies at GM and Chrysler. The industry is operating within 7% of record levels, making 12 million cars and trucks a year. Not only have GM, Ford and Fiat Chrysler all been hiring and investing in U.S. plants, but foreign automakers are expanding operations here as well. The largest BMW plant in the world is now in South Carolina, and the plant exports most of the cars it builds there. And the boom isn’t just about big-ticket items. Chemical production hit a record $797 billion last year, up 30% in the last 10 years. The chemical boom has been fueled by the record U.S. energy boom, which has made oil and natural gas particularly cheap. Petroleum is a key raw material for many chemicals, most of which are produced using energy from natural gas.

By making some line maintenance packages bigger, “We are using our line-maintenance staff more efficiently” and evening out the peaks and valleys, Sayar said. The Turkish airline also is saving money by not grounding aircraft for routine maintenance, which allows it to fly and maximize revenue, he added. Fergus Wilson, Aer Lingus chief technical officer, said the Irish carrier is following a similar process by moving some maintenance tasks out of C checks to the line environment, but it also is evaluating out-of-phase and B checks to avoid having to move other checks forward. “We are working within bounds of our maintenance planning documents,” but together with Airbus and the regulatory authorities, he hopes to gain approval for escalated intervals in the future, he said.

Stephen DeMont, 60, was getting off his bicycle near Seattle's University of Washington Medical Center last week when he keeled over.  A medical student passing by told someone to call 911 as he rushed to perform CPR. Through a new app called PulsePoint, that call sent an alert to the cell phone of all trained medics in the area - at the time, 41 of them.  One rushed to provide backup.  Five days later, DeMont was walking, smiling, laughing, and talking about how PulsePoint saved his life.   Stephen DeMont (center) embraces cardiac nurse Madeline Dahl next to medical student Zach Forcade - the two medics who saved his life after he fell into cardiac arrest last week Seattle officials say the rescue shows the potential the free download has for connecting CPR-trained citizens with patients who urgently need their help.  It's being used in 2,000 U.S. cities in 28 states. 'I put it on my phone yesterday,' said DeMont's wife, Debi Quirk, a former registered nurse. 'He would not be here as we see him today.' Seattle officials hope DeMont's story will help persuade thousands more people to sign up for notifications; so far, about 4,000 people in Seattle have downloaded PulsePoint since the city adopted it earlier this year with financial support from an employee charitable fund at Boeing.  The goal is to have 15,000 using it. Developed by a former fire chief in Northern California, Richard Price, the app works through a city's 911 system.  When a call comes in, operators alert people within a certain radius that CPR assistance is needed, along with the location of the nearest portable defibrillator. About 900,000 people around the country have downloaded and carry the app, and 34,000 people have been activated to respond, he said, adding that alerts have been issued in 13,000 cardiac events. He came up with the idea in 2009, he said. He was in a restaurant when he heard sirens from his crews at the San Ramon Valley fire department.  As he wondered where they were going, they arrived at the restaurant.  'The patient was unconscious, unresponsive. I was 20 feet away on the other side of the wall,' Price said. 'The whole time I was listening to that siren, I could have been making a difference.' It occurred to him that at any given time, two-thirds of his staff was off duty — in restaurants, out in the community. If there was a way to alert them to such emergencies by phone, it could save lives, Price said. DeMont said he has always been skeptical about technology - but this app saved his life It's not clear how many lives have been saved thanks to the app. Patient confidentiality laws often prevent hospitals from disclosing a patient's outcome. Madeline Dahl, a 23-year-old cardiac nurse at the University of Washington Medical Center, said she downloaded the app about a month ago after reading a news story that mentioned it.  Last Friday morning was the first time she'd ever received an alert. She bolted down a couple flights of stairs and ran outside into the rain, where she found 27-year-old medical student Zach Forcade performing chest compressions. Forcade had been on his way into the hospital for a lecture when he saw DeMont, who was just getting off his bicycle, slump over.  He would not be here as we see him today [without this app] Debi Quirk, DeMont's wife and a former registered nurse 'I hadn't responded to a cardiac arrest before,' Forcade said. 'I thought, 'Did he just fall?' ... Even being in the medical field, I thought, 'Oh, man, who's going to step up?'' He told another passerby to call 911, which triggered an alert sent out to 41 responders nearby. It was reassuring when Dahl arrived to provide any needed backup, help check for a pulse and otherwise make sure Forcade was responding correctly, he said. For DeMont, it was about more than just being lucky.  A contract technical writer at Expedia, he said he has a love-hate relationship with technology — 'You see all these things about people falling off cliffs texting, people are so disconnected' — but the response from Forcade, Dahl and the use of PulsePoint reaffirmed his belief in its power to make a positive difference. 'There's hope,' DeMont said. He's due to have a defibrillator implanted on Thursday. Now he just has to figure out how to pay the $100,000 tab without insurance. For that, his family has turned to a program with a different app: GoFundMe.    Share or comment on this article e-mail 103 shares Most watched News videos Mob storm police station and lynch suspected paedophile Man discovers wife is cheating on him following her with drone Chili's manager snatches veteran's free meal after complaint Ivanka Trump gives glimpse of her father's $100m penthouse Obama on Trump: This office has a way of waking you up 100 special police agents protect suspected paedophile from mob Killer wife and lover speak out over fatal love triangle Obama's dig at Clinton over her ground game failures SNL mocks confident Clinton supporters with Dave Chappelle Protestor at an anti-Trump rally at Ohio State gets slammed Emotional Chelsea Handler fights back tears over election results Dashcam footage captures moment van swerves before crashing 'Reality has a way of asserting itself!'

Bassett, now a security consultant, with a 20-year career with GCHQ, spoke about US attempts to employ thousands of robots in a matter of years as it tries to stay ahead of the curve, the Express reported. In March, DARPA beefed up the US underwater warfare capabilities with an autonomous state-of-the-art drone ship designed for things like hunting down enemy submarines. Read more US prepares to hunt enemy submarines with giant sea drone (VIDEO) In the same vein, Boeing in May launched an unmanned submarine that would engage in both exploratory missions and warfare. And the trend of a crewless ship isn’t even strictly a military one anymore: Rolls Royce in June announced plans for “ghost ships” that would carry cargo and be implemented specifically in trade. “Intelligent robotic weapons – they’re a reality, and they will be much more of a reality by 2030,” Bassett said. “At some point around 2025 or thereabouts the US Army will actually have more combat robots than it will have human soldiers,” he added, mentioning upcoming robot trucks that would drive themselves and be more effective on the road than an ordinary manned vehicle. “But some of them are rather more exciting than trucks. So we will see in the West combat robots outnumbering human soldiers,” Basset continued. It remains to be seen, but if the current submarine-hunting ship is indeed as good at tracking down enemy vessels, some major money could be saved and loss of life avoided. READ MORE: Rolls Royce plans crewless ‘ghost ships’ for maritime trade (VIDEO) Basset also recounted progress made in the sphere of AI, professing that “artificial intelligence, robotics in general, those will begin to mesh together.” Transhumanists have been particularly vocal about the benefits of employing robot help, among them US presidential hopeful Zoltan Istvan – also a journalist and transhumanist philosopher and futurist. He believes they’ll be fit for combat duties in the next 10 years, and bets “there won’t be any deaths of US soldiers in war zones” by then. “There will still probably be special forces, but even they are going to have to be replaced at some point,” he told the Express earlier in October. However, Istvan is wary of fusing combat robots with AI, as are many of today’s thinkers. He believes “machines controlling machines” opens up the potential for an uprising. This is not too unlike what Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak has been saying. Along with Tesla and SpaceX’s Elon Musk, Stephen Hawking and other luminaries, they also believe a global AI arms race is underway. All claim that technology has become too advanced for humans to control – particularly the robots’ ability to learn.

Larry Pope, Emerald senior adviser, wouldn’t provide many details on what exactly has happened at the company but said it has scaled back its operations in Wichita. “We do have a core group remaining in Wichita,” Pope said Thursday. Pope declined to say how many people remain with the company or whether any employees were let go. “We’re not going to comment on personnel matters,” he said. “At this time we have scaled back operations in Wichita.” In April, Emerald announced its opening at Air Capital Flight Line in part of the former Boeing Wichita Modification Center. It said it had 26 employees, many of whom were former Boeing Wichita modification workers. The company aimed at using the former Boeing aircraft hangars at 4174 S. Oliver to do completions and modifications of special mission and VIP aircraft, aircraft acquisitions management and program management. The modifications would include aircraft up to the size of Boeing 747 jumbo jets. Pope said Emerald remains in business and is “in the process of establishing other operations,” but he wouldn’t say where those other operations would be. The space Emerald occupied on South Oliver included two hangars large enough to house four Boeing 747s.

Coming Thursday: the 2016 Defense One Summit, Nov. 17 in DC Yes, Big Data Did Triumph on Election Day White House: $11.6B More Needed for ISIS Fight, Afghanistan Will Trump Keep Obama’s Top Mideast General? Global Business Brief: Trump looks good for defense business; New faces at the Pentagon Sponsor Content How Cloud Will Affect the Future of Policing Defense One Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Email → News Threats Politics Business Tech Ideas New life for old jets; Contractors pour into Iraq; Turkey, Russia, and U.S. arms exports. By Marcus Weisgerber Read bio October 20, 2016 Topics The Global Business Brief Air Force Industry AA Font size + Print Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Email this article By Marcus Weisgerber Read bio October 20, 2016 Uncertain times lie ahead for American fighter jet manufacturing. As three…let’s call them heritage…aircraft enter the final years of production, factory jobs are at stake — but more fundamentally, so is the know-how to design and construct such sophisticated machines. Recent events have given Boeing and Lockheed Martin assembly lines a bit more life, such as the U.S. decision to allow Bahrain, Kuwait, and Qatar to buy new F-16 Falcons, F/A-18 Super Hornets, and F-15E Strike Eagles, respectively. And new planes aside, there’s still money to be made from the large fleets that will fly for the U.S. military and others for decades to come. Then there are the opportunities created when countries that fly perfectly good F-16s decide to get rid of them. Some are trading up to the new F-35 Joint Strike Fighter; others are shrinking their air operations amid tight budgets. Earlier this month, for example, Romania received six used Falcons from Portugal, a deal that promises new support contracts for Lockheed and related suppliers. I asked a State Department official about the potential for more such sales. Most Eastern European militaries have old Soviet warplanes, like the MiG-21s of Bulgaria and Slovenia, or no fighters at all, like Estonia, Lithuania and Latvia. They are barely suited to protect their borders, let alone deploy, say, to strike Islamic State militants in Iraq and Syria. It’s why the U.S. Air Force and NATO need to fly the air policing missions there, intercepting the Russian jets that approach or even cross over borders. Subscribe Get The Global Business Brief in your inbox: The must-read news, analysis and insights about the intersection of business and international security. Now Romania — which happens to be hosting a U.S. military transit hub and a NATO missile defense radar — is getting a half-dozen 4th-gen combat jets and has plans to build that up to an even dozen. As the State official put it, “These countries are joining the elite nations that fly F-16s.” That means Bucharest could help out with air policing in Eastern Europe and deepen its military relations with other NATO members through training and wargames. Across Eastern Europe, where many countries don’t have large or modern air forces, a third-party transfer — like Portugal’s divesting its F-16s to Romania — could help strengthen their militaries, the State official said. (FYI: The State Department must approve the transfer of U.S.-built military aircraft, even between NATO allies.) The Portugal-Romania deal took three years from start to finish. Lockheed and its predecessor General Dynamics have built more than 4,500 F-16s since the 1970s. Iraq is one on the only countries still buying new one, but many even decades-old Falcons are still more than flyable. Plenty of companies, in addition to Lockheed, offer upgrades and modifications to bring the older jets into the modern age. Romanian also flies second-hand American C-130 cargo planes, which it received in similar fashion to the F-16s. In 2005, The Netherlands sold some of its F-16s to to Jordan. Now the Netherlands is looking to divest more F-16s to make room for its new F-35s. For several years now, U.S. officials have been urging Eastern Europeans to swap their Soviet and Russian arms for American equipment. This would help them train with U.S. forces and seamlessly fight alongside the American military in battle. Poland is the poster child, having purchased 48 F-16s. And Polish sources have said they want more. Helping Out in Iraq With Iraqi forces advancing on Mosul, we thought we’d check in on the number of contractors supporting U.S. operations there — and it’s way up. Since the beginning of the year, the number has jumped 48 percent, according to the latest U.S. Central Command data. As of Oct. 1, there were 2,992 contractors involved in the effort, up from 1,403 last October. About one-third of those workers are supporting logistics and maintenance for American troops there. The second-largest grouping (15 percent) of contractors are supporting American bases, while 14 percent are working as interpreters. About 239, 8 percent, are working in security roles. Those 2,992 are supporting more than 4,400 American troops in Iraq, with 500 more are on the way to train and advise Iraqi security forces. And they are just the ones hired by the Pentagon. Overall, the U.S. government has about 7,700 contractors supporting it in Iraq. Welcome! You’ve reached Defense One’s Global Business Brief.

What Turkey-Russia Relations Mean for Defense The recent warming of ties between Russian and Turkish presidents Vladimir Putin and Recep Tayyip Erdogan could affect U.S. arms sales to Ankara, which is both a major buyer and supplier of American weapons and their components. In a note to investors, Cowen analyst Roman Schweizer wrote, “Turkey is an important customer of high-end U.S. weapon systems and a closer alignment with Russia could provoke the U.S. to rethink its FMS policy.” It’s part of a continuing story; back in Vol. 1, Issue 1, of the Global Business Brief, we told you how unrest in Turkey could affect the supply chains of major Pentagon projects, including the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. Boeing Opens New Composite Factory Even as Boeing winds down fighter jet production in St. Louis, the company is planning a $300 million composite factory there for its commercial airplanes business. In a statement, Boeing said it’s part of an effort to “diversify and grow its St. Louis-area operations.”  The 424,000-square-foot factory and its 700 workers will build composite parts for the wings and empennage of new 777X jetliner.

Zurbano AIRPORT officials on Thursday urged the public to be wary of bomb pranks and warned that pranksters faced jail. Their appeal came following a bomb scare from a Philippine Airlines aircraft from the United States a few minutes before it landed in Manila early Thursday morning. Someone from PAL flight PR103 had called to say there was a bomb on the plane, a Boeing B777-300 from Los Angeles with 333 passengers and 18 crew on board. The plane landed safely, but the responding policemen found no bomb after escorting its passengers to safety. Airport officials said while the plane was approaching the airport, a flight attendant who was inspecting one of the plane’s lavatories discovered a handwritten note saying there was a bomb on board.  The attendant immediately informed Captain Lawana Nakar about the note. He then called PAL station control in Manila and requested priority to land. It wasn’t clear if one of the passengers put the note on the lavatory. Last month a 34-year-old air cargo employee was arrested for joking he was carrying a bomb in his car. And in 2007 actor John Estrada was briefly held at the airport in General Santos City for joking  he was carrying a bomb in his bag.

X Norwegian Air to accelerate capacity growth in 2017 Airline to expand low-cost flights to US and other long-haul destinations Thu, Oct 20, 2016, 11:13 Norwegian’s third-quarter net profit was a record 992 million Norwegian crowns (€110 million), 19 per cent above last year’s figure. Photograph: Bloomberg         Budget airline Norwegian Air Shuttle said its capacity growth will speed up in 2017 as it rapidly expands low-cost flights to the United States and other long-haul destinations. Europe’s third-largest low-cost carrier by revenue after Ryanair and EasyJet reported record third-quarter earnings, beating market expectations with a 20 per cent rise in net profit. The airline said its capacity growth, measured by available seat kilometres (ASK), would be 30 per cent next year, up from 18 per cent in 2016. ASK measures an airline’s passenger-carrying capacity. Norwegian will have 32 new aircraft, including nine fuel-efficient Boeing Dreamliners, entering operation next year, bringing its total fleet to 144 by the end of 2017. “The overall development is good in all markets, and the biggest growth is in Spain, particularly on domestic routes. The routes between London and Paris and the US are in high demand,” chief executive Bjoern Kjos said in a statement. Norwegian has launched flights to the Middle East, southeast Asia and the United States, as well as expanding routes in its core European market, taking its low-cost offer into the long-haul market. It has even offered an eye-catching promise of $69 fares to cross the Atlantic. Brexit Unlike many of its European peers, Norwegian has been spared a negative impact from Britain’s vote in June to leave the European Union. “We are monitoring the post-Brexit situation in the UK and don’t see any effects in bookings so far,” chief financial officer Frode Foss told a news conference. Germany’s Lufthansa lifted its 2016 profit target late on Wednesday, after business bookings proved stronger than expected in September, sending the share up by some 7.7 per cent by 7.50am Irish time. Earlier this week Ryanair cut its annual profit forecast however due to a weaker pound. EasyJet, which depends on Britain for about half of sales, has already cut its profit forecast by a quarter for the year following the Brexit vote. ADVERTISEMENT Competition remains fierce and Ryanair said it expected to boost its market share in the coming months by selling more tickets at cheaper prices. Shares in Norwegian jumped more than 5 per cent on Thursday but are still down about 8 per cent so far this year, outperforming Ryanair and EasyJet, which are down 16 and 46 per cent respectively. “The report was clearly above expectations, booking remains good and cost performance solid,” SEB analyst Kenneth Sivertsen said in a note to clients, adding that 2017 earnings estimates could rise by 5-10 per cent. SEB has a “buy” rating on the stock. Norwegian’s third-quarter net profit was its best quarterly result ever, and came in at 992 million Norwegian crowns (€110 million), 19 per cent above last year, beating expectations for 943 million crowns in a Reuters poll. Its unit cost is still seen at 0.38 crowns this year, while unit costs next year were targeted at 0.38-0.39 crowns. – (Reuters)       Topics: European Union Norwegian Air Ryanair Subscribe.   More from The Irish Times Technology Snapchat has secretly filed for flotation, sources claim Personal Finance The bond rout and Irish pension savers: what you need to be aware of Golf Rory McIlroy focusing on Major improvement in 2017 Ireland The top five spots in Dublin to go for a walk with the kids Sponsored World-first tech restores mains electricity to Aran Islands Newbridge Silverware builds ambitious plan for US market My Jaguar F-Pace: ‘I was completely blown away’ Ten things to consider when buying a new sofa ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT Commenting on The Irish Times has changed.

The plane, a Boeing B777-300, was combed for explosives by the Police Aviation Security Group (Avsegroup) but no bomb was found. A source from PAL at NAIA Terminal 2 said a flight attendant discovered a handwritten bomb threat while inspecting one of the plane’s lavatories. On a paper cup was written, “Bomb was placed in the cargo and at seat 64E.” The flight attendant informed Capt. Lawana Nakar about the note. Nakar called PAL station control in Manila, requesting priority landing. “There is no bomb in the cargo compartment of Flight PR103 and even at seat number 64E,” according to an Avsegroup personnel. Manila International Airport Authority General Manager Ed Monreal appealed to international and domestic passengers to refrain from making bomb jokes because it can cause panic among passengers. Any person cracking a bomb joke or such act that poses grave and positive danger to public safety is a violation of Presidential Decree 1727 or the Anti-Bomb Joke Law. Authorities suspected that a passenger may have made the bomb threat as a joke. Share. Twitter Facebook Google+ Pinterest LinkedIn Tumblr Email loading...

The DEW market is estimated to be at $5.81 billion in 2015. The high growth of directed energy weapons in the defense industry is majorly attributed to a rise in defense expenditure, evolving nature of warfare, and technological innovations. With the evolution in the field of technology, the nature of warfare conduct has changed dramatically. DEW innovations have emerged as one of the promising ventures as they can effectively manage a wide range of asymmetric challenges as well as have noteworthy effects on future military warfare. Moreover, there are a number of opportunities for DEW in defense and homeland security applications. This high growth of directed energy weapons market in the defense industry is majorly amongst the various technologies used in the DEW; the high energy laser systems accommodates for the highest share in terms of market value. The technology is being used to perform lethal and non-lethal operations.

Downes Jr. Memorial Award. By receiving the 2016 prize, Miller joins the company of Gen. Jimmy Doolittle, for International Aviation and Aircraft Noise Abatement Policy; Sir Frank Whittle, inventor of the jet engine; Elrey Jeppesen, developer of the Jeppesen navigation charts; T. Wilson, chairman of The Boeing Co. for more than 40 years, and Col. Frank Borman, former astronaut and former head of Eastern Airlines. Miller was appointed director of Salt Lake City's airport in 1983 under then-Mayor Ted Wilson. After years overseeing the airport's elevation to a major hub and destination of several direct international flights, Miller moved to Tampa, Fla., as that city's airport director, and later oversaw Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson International, the nation's busiest airport. VIDEOS TOP JOBS He is retired and living back in Salt Lake City. — • Operation Give, directed by retired Chief Warrant Officer Paul Holton, also known as "Chief Wiggles," began its 2016 charity drive earlier this month when volunteers met at Flat Rate Doctors in Pleasant Grove to stuff 25,000 stockings with gifts. The stockings will be delivered to deployed military members. This marks the 12th year of delivering a little Christmas joy to those away from their friends and families. Operation Give began when Holton, a member of the Utah Army National Guard, was on active duty in Iraq in 2003. He began to send back emails, detailing his time and activities, to a friend in Salt Lake City, who then created a blog so that others could read Holton's journal. Holton's family and friends started sending him packages with items to make life in the desert summers more bearable. He shared the gifts with other GIs. Upon his return to Utah, he launched the program to send stuffed holiday stockings to soldiers abroad. — • Ray Wheeler has been a tireless advocate for cleaning up the Jordan River on Salt Lake City's west side. He has gone on hundreds of trash-collecting expeditions in his kayak and works with government officials to teach them about cleaning up the river and the adjoining open space for wildlife habitat. He is organizing regular cleanup drives with neighbors — both by foot and kayak — and he has volunteered hundreds of hours to beautifying the waterway. As a result, he recently was awarded a 2016 Good Neighbor Award by "Nextdoor," a private online social network. — • Salt Lake Tribune intern Zoe Woolf McGinn was driving from Orem to Salt Lake City recently when she became worried that a tire was low on air, so she stopped at a 7-Eleven near Orem to fill it up. She was struggling with the hose when Austin Westmoreland, a Utah Valley University police officer who was off-duty but working as a security guard at a nearby Check City, asked if he could help. He hopped into his car and had her follow him to a Discount Tire, where all of her tires were filled with air. He said she should be able to get home, but if she stopped on the way at the Discount Tire in Lindon and told them his name, the shop would fix the leak for free. — » Next page...

(Photo: Elaine Thompson / AP) Seattle — If your heart is going to stop, right outside a hospital is not a bad place for it. And if 41 people within a 330-yard radius have a cellphone app alerting them to your distress, so much the better. That’s what happened in Seattle last week when Stephen DeMont collapsed at a bus stop in front of University of Washington Medical Center. While a medical student rushed over and began chest compressions, a cardiac nurse just getting off her shift was alerted by her phone, sprinted outside and assisted until paramedics arrived. Five days later, DeMont, 60, is walking, smiling and talking about how the PulsePoint app helped save his life. Seattle officials say the rescue shows the potential the free download has for connecting CPR-trained citizens with patients who urgently need their help. It’s being used in 2,000 U.S. cities in 28 states. “I put it on my phone yesterday,” said DeMont’s wife, Debi Quirk, a former registered nurse. “He would not be here as we see him today.” Seattle officials hope DeMont’s story will help persuade thousands more people to sign up for notifications; so far, about 4,000 people in Seattle have downloaded PulsePoint since the city adopted it earlier this year with financial support from an employee charitable fund at Boeing. The goal is to have 15,000 using it. Developed by a former fire chief in Northern California, Richard Price, the app works through a city’s 911 system. When a call comes in, operators alert people within a certain radius that CPR assistance is needed, along with the location of the nearest portable defibrillator. About 900,000 people around the country have downloaded and carry the app, and 34,000 people have been activated to respond, he said, adding that alerts have been issued in 13,000 cardiac events. He came up with the idea in 2009, he said. He was in a restaurant when he heard sirens from his crews at the San Ramon Valley fire department. As he wondered where they were going, they arrived at the restaurant. “The patient was unconscious, unresponsive. I was 20 feet away on the other side of the wall,” Price said. “The whole time I was listening to that siren, I could have been making a difference.” It occurred to him that at any given time, two-thirds of his staff was off duty — in restaurants, out in the community. If there was a way to alert them to such emergencies by phone, it could save lives, Price said. It’s not clear how many lives have been saved thanks to the app. Patient confidentiality laws often prevent hospitals from disclosing a patient’s outcome. Madeline Dahl, a 23-year-old cardiac nurse at the University of Washington Medical Center, said she downloaded the app about a month ago after reading a news story that mentioned it. Last Friday morning was the first time she’d ever received an alert. She bolted down a couple flights of stairs and ran outside into the rain, where she found 27-year-old medical student Zach Forcade performing chest compressions. Forcade had been on his way into the hospital for a lecture when he saw DeMont, who was just getting off his bicycle, slump over. “I hadn’t responded to a cardiac arrest before,” Forcade said. “I thought, ‘Did he just fall?’ … Even being in the medical field, I thought, ‘Oh, man, who’s going to step up?’” He told another passerby to call 911, which triggered an alert sent out to 41 responders nearby. It was reassuring when Dahl arrived to provide any needed backup, help check for a pulse and otherwise make sure Forcade was responding correctly, he said. For DeMont, it was about more than just being lucky. A contract technical writer at Expedia, he said he has a love-hate relationship with technology — “You see all these things about people falling off cliffs texting, people are so disconnected” — but the response from Forcade, Dahl and the use of PulsePoint reaffirmed his belief in its power to make a positive difference. “There’s hope,” DeMont said. He’s due to have a defibrillator implanted on Thursday. Now he just has to figure out how to pay the $100,000 tab without insurance. For that, his family has turned to a program with a different app: GoFundMe. CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Wall Street is talking up U.S. defense stocks no matter who wins the presidential election in November. “After five years of austerity in the defense budget, we expect defense spending to increase regardless of whether Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump wins the presidency,” Dan Clifton, a policy strategist at Strategas Research Partners, told clients in a research note Wednesday. But a Trump win would boost defense spending even more, he adds. If Clinton wins, Boeing shares should benefit from the Democrat likely reinstating the Export-Import Bank, which supplies credit to foreign buyers of U.S. goods. If Trump wins, a broad swath of defense companies will gain favor, including Lockheed-Martin, a maker of combat aircraft and missile defense systems, General Dynamics, which makes combat vehicles, and Textron, which makes unmanned aircraft systems and surveillance systems. Joe Quinlan, head of market and thematic strategy for Bank of America Global Wealth & Investment Management and U.S. Trust, is also bullish on defense stocks. “Geopolitical uncertainty will remain the order of the day over the near term,” he wrote in an essay. “Given this environment, and on the expectation that U.S. defense spending is bound to increase under either presidential candidate, we reiterate one of our high-conviction investment themes of being long U.S. defense companies.” Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2eUnYwB

X Norwegian Air to accelerate capacity growth in 2017 Airline to expand low-cost flights to US and other long-haul destinations Thu, Oct 20, 2016, 11:13 Norwegian’s third-quarter net profit was a record 992 million Norwegian crowns (€110 million), 19 per cent above last year’s figure. Photograph: Bloomberg         Budget airline Norwegian Air Shuttle said its capacity growth will speed up in 2017 as it rapidly expands low-cost flights to the United States and other long-haul destinations. Europe’s third-largest low-cost carrier by revenue after Ryanair and EasyJet reported record third-quarter earnings, beating market expectations with a 20 per cent rise in net profit. The airline said its capacity growth, measured by available seat kilometres (ASK), would be 30 per cent next year, up from 18 per cent in 2016. ASK measures an airline’s passenger-carrying capacity. Norwegian will have 32 new aircraft, including nine fuel-efficient Boeing Dreamliners, entering operation next year, bringing its total fleet to 144 by the end of 2017. “The overall development is good in all markets, and the biggest growth is in Spain, particularly on domestic routes. The routes between London and Paris and the US are in high demand,” chief executive Bjoern Kjos said in a statement. Norwegian has launched flights to the Middle East, southeast Asia and the United States, as well as expanding routes in its core European market, taking its low-cost offer into the long-haul market. It has even offered an eye-catching promise of $69 fares to cross the Atlantic. Brexit Unlike many of its European peers, Norwegian has been spared a negative impact from Britain’s vote in June to leave the European Union. “We are monitoring the post-Brexit situation in the UK and don’t see any effects in bookings so far,” chief financial officer Frode Foss told a news conference. Germany’s Lufthansa lifted its 2016 profit target late on Wednesday, after business bookings proved stronger than expected in September, sending the share up by some 7.7 per cent by 7.50am Irish time. Earlier this week Ryanair cut its annual profit forecast however due to a weaker pound. EasyJet, which depends on Britain for about half of sales, has already cut its profit forecast by a quarter for the year following the Brexit vote. ADVERTISEMENT Competition remains fierce and Ryanair said it expected to boost its market share in the coming months by selling more tickets at cheaper prices. Shares in Norwegian jumped more than 5 per cent on Thursday but are still down about 8 per cent so far this year, outperforming Ryanair and EasyJet, which are down 16 and 46 per cent respectively. “The report was clearly above expectations, booking remains good and cost performance solid,” SEB analyst Kenneth Sivertsen said in a note to clients, adding that 2017 earnings estimates could rise by 5-10 per cent. SEB has a “buy” rating on the stock. Norwegian’s third-quarter net profit was its best quarterly result ever, and came in at 992 million Norwegian crowns (€110 million), 19 per cent above last year, beating expectations for 943 million crowns in a Reuters poll. Its unit cost is still seen at 0.38 crowns this year, while unit costs next year were targeted at 0.38-0.39 crowns. – (Reuters)       Topics: European Union Norwegian Air Ryanair Subscribe.   More from The Irish Times Technology Snapchat has secretly filed for flotation, sources claim Personal Finance The bond rout and Irish pension savers: what you need to be aware of Golf Rory McIlroy focusing on Major improvement in 2017 Ireland The top five spots in Dublin to go for a walk with the kids Sponsored World-first tech restores mains electricity to Aran Islands Newbridge Silverware builds ambitious plan for US market My Jaguar F-Pace: ‘I was completely blown away’ Ten things to consider when buying a new sofa ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT Commenting on The Irish Times has changed.

Norwegian has launched flights to the Middle East, southeast Asia and the United States, as well as expanding routes in its core European market, taking its low-cost offer into the long-haul market. It has even offered an eye-catching promise of $69 fares to cross the Atlantic (Shanghai: 600558.SS - news) . Unlike many of its European peers, Norwegian has been spared a negative impact from Britain's vote in June to leave the European Union. "We are monitoring the post-Brexit situation in the UK and don't see any effects in bookings so far," Chief Financial Officer Frode Foss told a news conference. Germany's Lufthansa lifted its 2016 profit target late on Wednesday, after business bookings proved stronger than expected in September, sending the share up by some 7.7 percent by 0750 GMT. Earlier this week Ryanair cut its annual profit forecast however due to a weaker pound. EasyJet (Other OTC: EJTTF - news) , which depends on Britain for around half of sales, has already cut its profit forecast by a quarter for the year following the Brexit vote. Competition remains fierce and Ryanair said it expected to boost its market share in the coming months by selling more tickets at cheaper prices. Shares in Norwegian jumped more than 5 percent on Thursday but are still down around eight percent so far this year, outperforming Ryanair and easyJet, which are down 16 and 46 percent respectively. "The report was clearly above expectations, booking remains good and cost performance solid," SEB (LSE: 0MGS.L - news) analyst Kenneth Sivertsen said in a note to clients, adding that 2017 earnings estimates could rise by 5-10 percent. SEB has a "buy" rating on the stock. Norwegian's third-quarter net profit was its best quarterly result ever, and came in at 992 million Norwegian crowns ($121.83 million), 19 percent above last year, beating expectations for 943 million crowns in a Reuters poll. Its unit cost (CASK) is still seen at 0.38 crowns this year, while unit costs next year were targeted at 0.38-0.39 crowns.

Senior, which had been relying on its aerospace division to offset the rapid drop-off in sales of trucks to oil and gas companies, said a slower-than-expected ramp-up in production of Airbus A320neo and A350 aircraft as well as Bombardier Inc.’s C Series jet had hurt revenues. The division is also battling “supplier issues” in the U.S. and U.K., which it said it aims to resolve by the end of the year, while price negotiations with customers are still in progress. The profit downgrade is the latest in a string for Senior since the collapse in oil prices in 2014 started eating into sales of heavy trucks in North America, with the outlook for the business deteriorating again in the quarter ended Sept. 30. Senior said it is shifting production to more “cost-competitive countries,” including Mexico and India. “Senior’s end markets remain challenging and expectations for a meaningful improvement in the second half were, in hindsight, optimistic,” Investec analyst Rami Myerson said in a note to clients.

And if 41 people within a 330-yard radius have a cellphone app alerting them to your distress, so much the better. That's what happened in Seattle last week when Stephen DeMont collapsed at a bus stop in front of University of Washington Medical Center. While a medical student rushed over and began chest compressions, a cardiac nurse just getting off her shift at the hospital was alerted by her phone, sprinted outside and assisted until paramedics arrived. Five days later, DeMont, 60, is walking, smiling and talking about how the PulsePoint app helped save his life. Seattle officials say the rescue shows the potential the free download has for connecting CPR-trained citizens with patients who urgently need their help. It's being used in 2,000 U.S. cities in 28 states. "I put it on my phone yesterday," said DeMont's wife, Debi Quirk, a former registered nurse. "He would not be here as we see him today." Seattle officials hope DeMont's story will help persuade thousands more people to sign up for notifications; so far, about 4,000 people in Seattle have downloaded PulsePoint since the city adopted it earlier this year with financial support from an employee charitable fund at Boeing. The goal is to have 15,000 using it. Developed by a former fire chief in Northern California, Richard Price, the app works through a city's 911 system. When a call comes in, operators alert people within a certain radius that CPR assistance is needed, along with the location of the nearest portable defibrillator. About 900,000 people around the country have downloaded and carry the app, and 34,000 people have been activated to respond, he said, adding that alerts have been issued in 13,000 cardiac events. He came up with the idea in 2009, he said. He was in a restaurant when he heard sirens from his crews at the San Ramon Valley fire department. As he wondered where they were going, they arrived at the restaurant. "The patient was unconscious, unresponsive. I was 20 feet away on the other side of the wall," Price said. "The whole time I was listening to that siren, I could have been making a difference." It occurred to him that at any given time, two-thirds of his staff was off duty — in restaurants, out in the community. If there was a way to alert them to such emergencies by phone, it could save lives, Price said. It's not clear how many lives have been saved thanks to the app. Patient confidentiality laws often prevent hospitals from disclosing a patient's outcome. Madeline Dahl, a 23-year-old cardiac nurse at the University of Washington Medical Center, said she downloaded the app about a month ago after reading a news story that mentioned it. Last Friday morning was the first time she'd ever received an alert. She bolted down a couple flights of stairs and ran outside into the rain, where she found 27-year-old medical student Zach Forcade performing chest compressions. Forcade had been on his way into the hospital for a lecture when he saw DeMont, who was just getting off his bicycle, slump over. "I hadn't responded to a cardiac arrest before," Forcade said. "I thought, 'Did he just fall?' ... Even being in the medical field, I thought, 'Oh, man, who's going to step up?'" He told another passerby to call 911, which triggered an alert sent out to 41 responders nearby. It was reassuring when Dahl arrived to provide any needed backup, help check for a pulse and otherwise make sure Forcade was responding correctly, he said. For DeMont, it was about more than just being lucky. A contract technical writer at Expedia, he said he has a love-hate relationship with technology — "You see all these things about people falling off cliffs texting, people are so disconnected" — but the response from Forcade, Dahl and the use of PulsePoint reaffirmed his belief in its power to make a positive difference. "There's hope," DeMont said. He's due to have a defibrillator implanted on Thursday. Now he just has to figure out how to pay the $100,000 tab without insurance. For that, his family has turned to a program with a different app: GoFundMe. ___ Follow Johnson at https://twitter.com/GeneAPseattle ___ This story has been corrected to say man was in cardiac arrest instead of having heart attack, and to say that about 900,000 people around the country have downloaded and carry the app, and 34,000 people have been activated to respond,       E-mail this Article Print this Article Share this Article           Story Tools   E-mail this Article Print this Article Share this Article   Font: * * * * *   Image: * * * *     Related Topics   business Seattle The Canadian Press         Business Videos         Most Popular canada.com E-mailed Shared     Sponsored By           FP Business Wire »   FP Business Wire   Royal Gold Increases Common Stock Dividend 4.4% to $0.96 per Share Cintas Recognized as an Aon Best Employer in Canada for the 9th Time SCOREART.COM Launches Exclusive Wall Art to Celebrate the Chicago Cubs Victory           News Business Sports Entertainment Lifestyle Health Travel Technology Don't Miss: Happening Now Video Centre Live chats Blogs on canada.com canada.com on Facebook Most Popular Formats Sitemap / RSS Contests Blogs Photo Galleries Videos Canada.com About Us Contact Us Advertise with Us FAQs Tools Canada.com Search for a Job Buy / Sell a Car Infomart Place a Classified Ad Newsletters and Alerts My Account Flyercity.ca About canada.com | Privacy Statement | Terms | Copyright & Permissions © 2010-2016 Postmedia Network Inc.

Africa América Latina عربي Argentina Brasil Canada 中国 Deutschland España France India Italia 日本 México РОССИЯ United Kingdom United States Industrials | Thu Oct 20, 2016 | 5:00am EDT UPDATE 2-Norwegian Air sees faster 2017 capacity growth after record Q3 earnings * Q3 is best quarterly result ever * Shares jump more than 5 pct * Sees 30 pct 2017 capacity growth, up from 18 pct in 2016 * No impact on bookings from Brexit vote (Adds analyst, CFO, Brexit, shares, background) By Joachim Dagenborg OSLO, Oct 20 Budget airline Norwegian Air Shuttle said its capacity growth will speed up in 2017 as it rapidly expands low-cost flights to the United States and other long-haul destinations. Europe's third-largest low-cost carrier by revenue after Ryanair and easyJet reported record third-quarter earnings, beating market expectations with a 20 percent rise in net profit. The airline said its capacity growth, measured by available seat kilometres (ASK), would be 30 percent next year, up from 18 percent in 2016. ASK measures an airline's passenger-carrying capacity. Norwegian will have 32 new aircraft, including nine fuel-efficient Dreamliners, from Boeing Co entering operation next year, bringing its total fleet to 144 by end-2017. "The overall development is good in all markets, and the biggest growth is in Spain, particularly on domestic routes. The routes between London and Paris and the U.S. are in high demand," Chief Executive Bjoern Kjos said in a statement. Norwegian has launched flights to the Middle East, southeast Asia and the United States, as well as expanding routes in its core European market, taking its low-cost offer into the long-haul market. It has even offered an eye-catching promise of $69 fares to cross the Atlantic. Unlike many of its European peers, Norwegian has been spared a negative impact from Britain's vote in June to leave the European Union. "We are monitoring the post-Brexit situation in the UK and don't see any effects in bookings so far," Chief Financial Officer Frode Foss told a news conference. Germany's Lufthansa lifted its 2016 profit target late on Wednesday, after business bookings proved stronger than expected in September, sending the share up by some 7.7 percent by 0750 GMT. Earlier this week Ryanair cut its annual profit forecast however due to a weaker pound. EasyJet, which depends on Britain for around half of sales, has already cut its profit forecast by a quarter for the year following the Brexit vote. Competition remains fierce and Ryanair said it expected to boost its market share in the coming months by selling more tickets at cheaper prices. Shares in Norwegian jumped more than 5 percent on Thursday but are still down around eight percent so far this year, outperforming Ryanair and easyJet, which are down 16 and 46 percent respectively. "The report was clearly above expectations, booking remains good and cost performance solid," SEB analyst Kenneth Sivertsen said in a note to clients, adding that 2017 earnings estimates could rise by 5-10 percent. SEB has a "buy" rating on the stock. Norwegian's third-quarter net profit was its best quarterly result ever, and came in at 992 million Norwegian crowns ($121.83 million), 19 percent above last year, beating expectations for 943 million crowns in a Reuters poll. Its unit cost (CASK) is still seen at 0.38 crowns this year, while unit costs next year were targeted at 0.38-0.39 crowns.

With the November 8 elections just 19 days away, the face-off in Las Vegas was seen as the Republican nominee's last best chance to turn around a sinking White House bid. But with millions watching on television, a defiant Trump turned what many thought began as his strongest debate performance yet into a gift to Clinton and another major headache for Republicans. Asked point-blank whether he would accept the results of the elections no matter what, the 70-year-old reality television star said: "I'll tell you at the time. I'll keep you in suspense, OK?" Clinton declared herself "appalled" by what she said was an attack on 240 years of US democracy. Quoting her former rival Bernie Sanders, she called Trump the "most dangerous person to run for president in the modern history of America." Trump's shattering of political convention dominated US newspaper headlines and television coverage. - Worried Republicans - Republicans worried about the impact of Trump's remarks on Republicans in down-ballot races. Reince Priebus, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, offered assurances on MSNBC. "Barring massive voter fraud, of course he is going to accept the results of the elections," he said. But Republican Senator Jeff Flake said Trump was "beyond the pale" and onetime presidential candidate Senator Lindsey Graham said if Trump loses, it will be "because he failed as a candidate". Trump's campaign manager Kellyanne Conway, defended the candidate Thursday against charges of undermining US democracy. "If anybody has added to American democracy in the last year and a half it's Donald Trump," she told CNN, while insisting her boss would respect the vote result "absent, widespread fraud or irregularities." Democrats called on Republican leaders to repudiate "Trump's utter contempt for our democracy," as Nevada Senator Harry Reid put it. "What he said tonight is part of his whole effort to blame somebody else for his campaign, and where he stands in this election," Clinton told reporters as she flew home to New York. Trump left Las Vegas immediately after the debate, heading to swing state Ohio for a day of campaigning. He meets up with Clinton again at the end of the day in New York at the Al Smith Dinner, an annual charity event where the candidates traditionally engage in a "friendly roast." But the animosity between them seems almost certain to get in the way. They would not even shake hands at Wednesday night's debate, and at one point Trump interrupted Clinton to call her "a nasty woman". - 'Relieved and very grateful' - Clinton, who is vying to become the first woman president of the United States, told reporters she was "both relieved and very grateful" that the debates were now behind her. Polls show her leading by more than six points and making gains even in states like Arizona, Texas and Georgia that have long been in the Republican column. "Hillary Clinton almost certainly will win the election, but the question is what is going to be the effect on Republican Senate, House and other candidates," said Robert Erikson, a political science professor at Columbia University. On Thursday, Michelle Obama will be stumping for Clinton in Arizona and President Barack Obama will speak at a rally in Miami. Obama earlier in the week told Trump to "stop whining" about a rigged election and go try to get people to vote for him. But the New York billionaire plowed ahead anyway, paying no heed. "The media is so dishonest and so corrupt and the pile-on is so amazing," Trump said, referring to reports citing women accusing him of sexual assault, which he said were "fiction" and drummed up by Team Clinton. He alleged that millions of fake voters had been registered and that the 68-year-old Clinton should not even have been allowed to run because she mishandled classified State Department emails. - 'Puppet' talk - The former secretary of state scored an early hit against the Republican real estate mogul, alleging that Russian President Vladimir Putin was backing his run for office. Trump argued that he might have better relations with Moscow than Clinton would, declaring: "Putin, from everything I see, has no respect for this person." Clinton's response was sharp: "Well, that's because he would rather have a puppet as president of the United States." Trump blustered back: "No puppet. You're the puppet."

(AP Photo/Elaine Thompson) Single page Share This Article ARTICLE PHOTO GALLERY (4) Seattle • If you're going to have a heart attack, right outside a hospital is not a bad place to do it. And if 41 people within a 330-yard radius have a cellphone app alerting them to your distress, so much the better. That's what happened in Seattle last week when Stephen DeMont collapsed at a bus stop in front of University of Washington Medical Center. While a medical student rushed over and began chest compressions, a cardiac nurse just getting off her shift at the hospital was alerted by her phone, sprinted outside and assisted until paramedics arrived. Five days later, DeMont, 60, is walking, smiling and talking about how the PulsePoint app helped save his life. VIDEOS TOP JOBS Seattle officials say the rescue shows the potential the free download has for connecting CPR-trained citizens with patients who urgently need their help. It's being used in 2,000 U.S. cities in 28 states. "I put it on my phone yesterday," said DeMont's wife, Debi Quirk, a former registered nurse. "He would not be here as we see him today." Seattle officials hope DeMont's story will help persuade thousands more people to sign up for notifications; so far, about 4,000 people in Seattle have downloaded PulsePoint since the city adopted it earlier this year with financial support from an employee charitable fund at Boeing. The goal is to have 15,000 using it. Developed by a former fire chief in Northern California, Richard Price, the app works through a city's 911 system. When a call comes in, operators alert people within a certain radius that CPR assistance is needed, along with the location of the nearest portable defibrillator. Some 34,000 off-duty professional and citizen responders around the country have downloaded it, Price said Wednesday, and they've been alerted to more than 13,000 cardiac events. He came up with the idea in 2009, he said. He was in a restaurant when he heard sirens from his crews at the San Ramon Valley fire department. As he wondered where they were going, they arrived at the restaurant. "The patient was unconscious, unresponsive. I was 20 feet away on the other side of the wall," Price said. "The whole time I was listening to that siren, I could have been making a difference." It occurred to him that at any given time, two-thirds of his staff was off duty — in restaurants, out in the community. If there was a way to alert them to such emergencies by phone, it could save lives, Price said. It's not clear how many lives have been saved thanks to the app. Patient confidentiality laws often prevent hospitals from disclosing a patient's outcome. Madeline Dahl, a 23-year-old cardiac nurse at the University of Washington, said she downloaded the app about a month ago after reading a news story that mentioned it. Last Friday morning was the first time she'd ever received an alert. She bolted down a couple flights of stairs and ran outside into the rain, where she found 27-year-old medical student Zach Forcade performing chest compressions. Forcade had been on his way into the hospital for a lecture when he saw DeMont, who was just getting off his bicycle, slump over. "I hadn't responded to a cardiac arrest before," Forcade said. "I thought, 'Did he just fall?' ... Even being in the medical field, I thought, 'Oh, man, who's going to step up?'" He told another passerby to call 911, which triggered an alert sent out to 41 responders nearby. It was reassuring when Dahl arrived to provide any needed backup, help check for a pulse and otherwise make sure Forcade was responding correctly, he said. » Next page...

The Rating Outlook is Stable. SECURITY The LOFT revenue bonds are secured by a six-cent levy per gallon of motor and other fuels sold in the county. Revenues are collected by the state and distributed to each county and its incorporated municipalities based on a distribution formula formalized in an inter-local agreement. KEY RATING DRIVERS The upgrade of the county's IDR to 'AA+' from 'AA' reflects the application of Fitch's new 'U.S. Tax-Supported Rating Criteria' published on April 18, 2016 and specifically the county's strong operating performance including maintenance of high levels of reserves through the economic cycle supported by ample revenue and expenditure flexibility, and low combined liability burden of debt and pensions. Fitch expects the county's debt and pension liabilities to remain low going forward given limited debt plans, rapid amortization of existing debt, and participation in an adequately funded, state-administered pension plan. The rating upgrade to 'A+' from 'A' on the LOFT bonds reflects improved debt service coverage, negligible expected growth prospects, volatility of the pledged revenue stream but strong resilience through a moderate downturn scenario. The rating also reflects Fitch's expectation that LOFT revenues will not be leveraged to the 1.25x additional bonds test. Economic Resource Base The local economy is based on a diverse mix of aerospace, manufacturing, agriculture and tourism. The Kennedy Space Center (KSC) serves as both an area employment anchor and a tourist attraction. The presence of KSC, despite termination of the space shuttle program in 2011, and the county's highly trained workforce has stimulated the location of numerous aerospace and other technologically--related firms within the county. The aerospace industry within the county has been growing and expansions at Northrop Grumman, Boeing and Embraer are either planned or underway. Revenue Framework: 'aa' factor assessment Fitch expects county revenues to grow in line with inflation which is consistent with its slowly growing population and employment base. The county retains the legal ability to generate substantial additional revenues under its 10 mill property tax cap. Expenditure Framework: 'aa' factor assessment County expenditures cover a wide array of government services. Overall spending patterns are expected to align with future revenue growth. Management has significant expenditure flexibility through its partial control of headcount and moderate carrying costs, despite having made large spending cuts during the past recession. Long-Term Liability Burden: 'aaa' factor assessment The county's long-term liability burden that includes debt and net pension liability is modest at 4.2% of personal income. Fitch expects this metric to remain low given limited debt plans, rapid amortization of direct debt and adequate funding of the state-run pension plan. Operating Performance: 'aaa' factor assessment Management, through its considerable revenue and expenditure flexibility, is expected to maintain available reserves within a healthy 10% to 15% of expenditures through the economic cycle. RATING SENSITIVITIES CONTINUING STRUCTURAL BALANCE: Fitch expects that the county will maintain balanced operations at or above a level consistent with the rating. COVERAGE OF LOFT DEBT SERVICE: The rating on the LOFT bonds is sensitive to the level of debt service coverage provided by LOFT receipts. CREDIT PROFILE The county's economy was hit hard by the recession with employment falling by over 8% between 2006 and 2010 and unemployment rates topping 11% in 2011. Since 2011, economic activity has generally recovered but employment growth has been tepid, averaging 0.6% growth between 2010 and 2015. Factors which have hindered gains in employment include termination of the space shuttle in 2011, federal sequestration in 2013 and cutbacks in personnel in the county's schools, the largest employer. Unemployment rates have gradually declined since the 2011 peak and the May 2016 rate of 4.7% equaled those of the state and nation. Housing values declined by over 50% between mid-2006 and January 2012 according to the Zillow Group. Values have slowly risen since and were up 9.7% over the past 12 months but remain well below the pre-recession peak. Zillow projects a 4.5% increase in home values over the next year. The housing recovery has boosted the county's mostly residential tax base with steady growth since fiscal 2013. Revenue Framework Property taxes comprise the major source of general fund revenues and represented about 55% of total revenues and transfers in. Property tax revenues had declined both during and immediately after the recession as taxable values fell but, with the recovery of the tax base, have been on the upswing in recent years. Since fiscal 2012, the county has been gradually lowering its tax rate, tempering the rise in property taxes each year. Other major sources of revenue include intergovernmental revenues (17%) consisting mainly of state revenue sharing and half cent sales tax distributions and charges for county services (14.5%). Modest increases in county revenues are expected to continue going forward, in line with the county's slowly growing population and employment. This growth is anticipated to continue at a rate below U.S. GDP growth but consistent with inflation. The county's current tax rate of 5.47 mills allows for generation of substantial additional revenues under the state 10 mill property tax cap. Fitch estimates that the county could generate approximately $128 million in additional revenues if it chose to utilize the remaining property tax margin or about 60% of the fiscal 2016 general fund budget. Annual changes in the property tax rate are determined using a roll-back or revenue neutral rate, which is then adjusted for changes in the Florida per capita personal income. However, this limitation may be overridden by a super-majority or unanimous vote of the county board of commissioners. The county's charter limits the property tax levy such that budgeted revenues for the current fiscal year cannot increase by more than the lesser of 3% or CPI over budgeted revenues in the prior year. This limit can also be overridden by a supermajority vote of the commissioners but only on a finding of an emergency or critical need. Taxable property classified as new construction and other improvements are excluded from the calculation. The county also has the ability to increase various license and permit revenues and service charges that make up a smaller but still notable portion of its revenue base. Expenditure Framework The county provides a full array of government services to its citizens with the exception of primary education, which is provided by the county school board. Public safety represents the largest general fund expenditure item at 44% of the budget and includes policing activity and detention/correction operations. Fire rescue operations are reported in a separate emergency services fund. Public safety spending fell through fiscal 2012 but has since increased steadily through fiscal 2015. Over the long term, county spending has generally been in line with revenue growth. This trend is expected to continue in the future as service needs continue to grow modestly. During the recession, in response to significant revenue declines, county management scaled back spending utilizing layoffs, furlough days and across the board budgetary cuts. As a result, general fund spending fell by 20% between fiscals 2008 and 2012. Spending has since steadily increased by a cumulative 9% through fiscal 2015. The county retains significant cost cutting flexibility through its ability to temporarily control employee headcount and compensation. Officials have indicated that available measures to trim spending include layoffs, service level reductions, operating hour reductions and reducing employer contributions for health insurance. Carrying costs are moderate at about 12% of spending. Long-Term Liability Burden The county's long-term liability burden includes both debt and pension liabilities and is modest at 4.2% of personal income. This ratio is not expected to change substantially going forward given limited debt issuance plans and adequate pension funding levels. Debt levels are generally modest with total debt to personal income of 3.3%. Outstanding bonds consist primarily of limited ad valorem tax bonds and revenue bonds, including sales tax and various gas tax-secured bonds. The county has no unlimited tax general obligation bonds outstanding. Amortization of direct debt is rapid with over 70% of principal retired within the next 10 years. The county's five year capital improvement plan includes a manageable $370 million of projects of which almost 70% are attributable to enterprise operations. There are no firm plans for additional bonds. County employees participate in the Florida Retirement System (FRS), a statewide multiple employer cost sharing pension program. FRS is adequately funded with an 85.9% funding ratio as of June 30, 2015, based on Fitch's adjusted discount rate of 7%. The county's adjusted proportionate share of FRS net pension liability constitutes a modest 0.9% of personal income. Operating Performance County management has demonstrated its ability to adjust both revenues and spending when faced with economically driven downturns in revenues. To offset revenue declines experienced between fiscals 2010 and 2012, county officials trimmed spending by 15% while also raising tax rates and utilizing some fund balance to maintain operations. Fitch believes the county would continue to utilize its budgetary flexibility and solid reserves to offset the effects of a moderate recession-driven decline while maintaining reserves above the county's 10% minimum target. The county is expected to maintain available reserves within the range of 10% to 15% of spending as has been the case in the recent past. Fiscal 2015 general fund operations reported a modest surplus of about $3 million, raising unrestricted fund balance to $29 million or a healthy 11.9% of spending. Fiscal 2016 operations are expected to result in a modest surplus of about $1.7 million. LOFT Bonds Upgraded The rating upgrade to 'A+' from 'A' on the LOFT bonds reflects improved debt service coverage, slow expected growth prospects, historic volatility of the pledged revenue stream and strong resilience through a moderate downturn scenario. The rating also reflects Fitch's expectation that LOFT revenues will not be leveraged to the 1.25x additional bonds test. Pledged LOFT revenues consist of revenues received by the county from the first six cents of the local option fuel tax levied per net gallon on motor fuel sold within the county pursuant to Section 336.025(1)(a), Florida Statues. The state collects the LOFT and distributes it back to the county and its municipalities in accordance with an inter-local agreement between the county and municipalities within the county; however, the rating on the LOFT bonds is not tied to that of the county's IDR. Under the existing inter-local agreement, LOFT proceeds are allocated 50% based on population and 50% based on transportation expenditures made over the preceding five years. The county's share of LOFT distributions must be at least 47.14% of total county distributions. The inter-local agreement expires in 2037 coincident with the final maturity of the bonds. LOFT collections increased by over 25% in fiscal 2012 due to the installation of 24 large (6.3 million gallons) diesel storage tanks at Port Canaveral. Revenues were essentially flat in fiscals 2013 and 2014 but grew by 6.2% in fiscal 2015. Year-to-date (YTD) collections were up 10% from last fiscal year although the difference at the end of the fiscal year may narrow as a large true-up payment in September 2015 may not be repeated in 2016. Fitch expects more modest growth in LOFT revenues in the future. To evaluate the sensitivity of the LOFT to cyclical decline, Fitch considers both modeled revenue sensitivity results (using the same 1% decline in national GDP scenario that supports assessments in the IDR framework) and the largest decline in revenues over the period covered by the revenue sensitivity analysis. Based on the 14-year pledged revenue history FAST generates a 5% scenario decline in pledged revenues and the largest actual cumulative decline in historical revenues is a 6.5% decline in fiscal year 2008. Based on LOFT revenue of $9.5 million in fiscal 2015 which cover maximum annual debt service (MADS) by 1.63x, Fitch estimates the structure could tolerate a 38% drop in revenue which is 7.8x the scenario results and 6x the largest actual revenue decline in the review period. These results are consistent with an 'aa' level of coverage cushion. Assuming leverage to the 1.25x ABT, the scenario results are mixed. However, management has indicated that it has no intention of further leverage of the revenue stream. LOFT revenues in excess of debt service are used to fund pay-as-you-go road projects.

Like this story, share it with millions of investors on M3 Lockheed, others in fray to supply single-engine jets to India There are primarily three manufacturers of these single-engine fighter jets which could be in the race – Lockheed Martin which manufacture the F-16’s, Boeing which makes Super Hornets and Swedish Saab that manufactures Gripen. Post Your Comments Share Cancel | 1 Comments Ronojoy Banerjee (more) Reporter, CNBC-TV18 | After signing the Rafale deal India has kick-started its process to acquire single-engine fighter jets. Last week the Ministry of Defence had issued request information for acquiring single-engine fighter jets. India is looking to acquire these jets to replace their old warhorse the MIG-21’s. Rafale jets are double-engine jets. There are primarily three manufacturers of these single-engine fighter jets who could be in the race – Lockheed Martin which manufactures the F-16’s, Boeing which makes Super Hornets and Swedish Saab that manufactures Gripen. CNBC-TV18 learns from sources that a team from Lockheed Martin in the US will be in India to meet senior officials at the defence ministry. They have also sought a meeting with the Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar and hope to meet officials in the Prime Minister’s office as well. During these meetings the company will suggest manufacturing the F-16’s in India. They are also likely to state that once India’s requirements are met, then with government approval in future, they would be willing to export these to other countries and thereby make India and export hub for the company. If this happens, it could give a big boost to the local suppliers. However, a similar promise is likely to be made by Saab too – they have already said that they are willing to shift their manufacturing base to India. Boeing, too, is expected to make similar promises. Tags  Ministry of Defence Rafael deal F-16’s Super Hornets Boeing Swedish Saab Gripen Buy, Hold, Sell ?

The Dow Jones industrial average rose about 40 points, with Goldman Sachs contributing the most gains. The S&P 500 gained 0.2 percent, with energy rising approximately 1.4 percent to lead advancers. The energy sector had traded more than 2 percent higher earlier in the session, after the Energy Information Administration reported a 5.3 million crude oil drawdown. West Texas Intermediate futures for November delivery rose 2.6 percent to settle at $51.60 per barrel. "It's a combination of energy rising and better-than-expected earnings," said Christian Magoon, CEO of Amplify Investments. "We're just riding that right now." The Nasdaq composite closed less than 0.1 percent higher. Earnings season carried on Wednesday, with eight of the 13 S&P components that posted results this morning beating Wall Street estimates, according to Nick Raich, CEO of The Earnings Scout. Morgan Stanley, Abbott Labs and BB&T were among the companies that exceeded expectations on both earnings per share and revenue. Morgan Stanley continued the trend of big banks beating forecasts on strong performances from trading. Dow component Intel also reported better-than-expected results Tuesday afternoon, but its stock fell nearly 6 percent on light revenue guidance. Companies scheduled to report are eBay, American Express and Mattel, among others. Getty Images Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. In economic news, The Fed released the latest iteration of its so-called Beige Book, which summarizes economic conditions in the U.S. In it, the Fed said economic activity increased at a modest pace in most regions. "The report failed to move the needle in any way. This was as much an in-line report as we've had," said Adam Sarhan, CEO of Sarhan Capital. The Beige Book was expected to garner more attention than usual as investors search for more clues about when the central bank will raise interest rates. "Some of the economic news we've gotten has been pretty mixed, but it's been mostly good," said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at First Standard Financial. Cardillo added he expects the Fed to raise rates in December. Other economic data released Wednesday included housing start and permits for September. Housing starts fell 9 percent last month, but permits spiked 6.3 percent. Also, U.S. mortgage applications rose 0.6 last week, as higher rates did not deter buyers. "The bizarre plunge in multi family starts is inexplicable but the rise in permits says it was an outlier," said Peter Boockvar, chief market analyst at The Lindsey Group, in a note. Elsewhere in the economic calendar, Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan said the Fed can be patient and raise interest rates gradually. New York Fed President William Dudley is also scheduled to speak Wednesday. San Francisco Fed President John Williams also spoke, but did not comment on monetary policy. Market participants will also keep an eye on the U.S. presidential election, with Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump scheduled to hold their third and final debate before the election. Clinton currently hold a double-digit lead over Trump, according to an NBC/ Wall Street Journalpoll released Sunday. "Tonight's debate offers Donald Trump one of his last opportunities to make a dent in the apparently insurmountable lead enjoyed by Hillary Clinton," said Jeremy Klein, chief market strategist at FBN Securities, in a note. "With the former Secretary of State starting to pack her bags for the White House, I doubt that the E-Minis will move much overnight during the broadcast." "The election balloon is shrinking as we head into the third debate," said Phil Blancato, CEO of Ladenburg Thalmann Asset Management. He also said he expects the market to rally towards the end of the year. " People are going to be happy the election will be over, and that 's going to give them confidence." U.S. Treasurys were mixed, with the two-year note yield lower around 0.80 percent and the 10-year yield higher at 1.75 percent. The U.S. dollar traded flat to higher against a basket of currencies, with the euro near $1.097 and the yen around 103.4. Overseas, European stocks traded mostly higher, with the Stoxx 600 index rising 0.34 percent. In Asia, stocks closed mixed, with the Nikkei 225 rising 0.2 percent and the Hang Seng index falling 0.38 percent.

The Apache is being used as part of Raptor Fury, a month-long training exercise to validate the mission readiness of 16th CAB with support from nearly 1,500 7th ID Soldiers. (U.S. Army photo/Brian Harris) Posted By: Richard Sisk October 19, 2016 AH-64 Apache helicopter gunships have been flying combat missions in support of the Iraqi security forces in the advance from the south on Mosul, a U.S. general said Wednesday. “They’ve been flying at night, supporting any nighttime operations that the Iraqis are doing” since the Mosul offensive started Monday, Army Maj. Gen. Gary Volesky said of the Boeing Co.-made helicopters in a video briefing from Baghdad to the Pentagon. “That platform has a lot of capability to see a long range at night and use its weapons system in a stand-off capacity to strike targets, and that’s what they’re doing,” said Volesky, commander of Combined Joint Forces Land Component Command-Operation Inherent Resolve, as well as commander of the 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault). The use of the Apaches had been an open question as the long-awaited push to retake Mosul began with coordinated advances from the south by the Iraqi security forces and from the east by Kurdish Peshmerga forces. Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi had barred use of the Apaches in previous campaigns to retake Ramadi and Fallujah in Anbar province. Navy Capt. Jeff Davis, a Pentagon spokesman, on Tuesday said the Apaches were ready to join the fight but he could not confirm that they had gone into action. Apache helicopters have been in Iraq since the U.S. began the buildup against the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria in the summer of 2014 but they have been used sparingly, mostly to provide added security for visiting dignitaries in Baghdad.

Fuller Montana's Billings Flying Service, Inc. owns and operates a fleet of Boeing CH-47D Chinooks among its Bell Helicopter rotorcraft. The Chinooks are now nearing maximum flight hours allowed before service is needed, according to local news reports. Billings Flying Service would like to build its own hangar to perform services, but have been met with hurdles. After a lawsuit was filed and settled by surrounding property owners who feared too much noise and one zone change was approved earlier this year, a second zone change was required. It has recently been approved and should allow Billings Flying Service to proceed with construction and operation of its hangar. The company became the first civilian operator to type-certify the Chinook with the FAA in 2014, using them for firefighting and construction projects. Since then, the Chinooks have been fighting fires in multiple states. Widespread need for its capabilities this past summer led to the need for service. The Boeing CH-47 has the ability to lift up to 26,000 pounds. Billings Flying Service has its fleet fitted with three cargo hooks and a fire bucket, among other configurations.

Chief Executive Officer Peter Bellew said fare cuts aimed at boosting passenger numbers on Kuala Lumpur-London flights are bearing fruit, with the carrier’s market share up 9 percentage points in the past 11 weeks. The Asian company, which saw passenger confidence slump after two fatal crashes in 2014, now accounts for 53 per cent of traffic between the two cities, up from 40 per cent as recently as May, Bellew, who took over on July 1, said in an interview. British Airways has a 20 per cent market share, he said. Malaysia Air has begun selling return tickets between Kuala Lumpur and London for as little as £399 (RM2,052), undercutting BA by 4 to 5 per cent, Bellew said. It offers 2,000 seats a day on two Airbus Group SE A380 flights, versus about 500 at the UK carrier, which has a single Boeing Co. 787 service. Gulf carriers control about 7 per cent of the market, with 3 per cent of people travelling via Singapore, according to the CEO, who joined the company as chief operating officer in 2015 after spending nine years working under Ryanair Holdings Plc CEO Michael O’Leary. Malaysia Air is seeking to stimulate bookings after seeing demand collapse following 2014’s tragedies, when one jetliner vanished after veering off course and another was shot down over a war zone. Under Bellew, the carrier is revamping its fares to sell fewer bargain-basement tickets and offer less of a range between the highest and lowest prices, while discounting in strategically important markets such as the UK Business boost Even though BA is countering the price cuts, Malaysia Air, which is seeking to return to profit in 2018, will take whatever steps are necessary to remain “price leader” on the London route, the CEO said. British Airways said in response to Bellew’s remarks that it “successfully relaunched” daily services between its Heathrow hub and Kuala Lumpur in May 2015, while adding that it cannot disclose performance figures for individual routes because such information is “commercially sensitive”. Business-class bookings for flights next year on Malaysia Air’s Asian routes are showing a strong increase, and the carrier remains committed to retaining a premium offering even as low-cost specialists led by local rival AirAsia Bhd. expand, Bellew said. A further increase of 4 or 5 percentage points in the business-class load factor would allow the operation to break even in the fourth quarter of 2017 even with declining fares, he said. The domestic Firefly unit, which operates a fleet of 12 Avions de Transport Regional ATR 72 turboprops, will be brought closer to the main airline by admitting it to the the Enrich frequent flyer programme, making tickets interchangeable and more closely aligning fares, the executive said. Bellew said that Malaysia Air plans to add as many as five or six new routes to China from a shortlist of nine, with the first set to be announced before the end of November. The move will help deepen the carrier’s exposure to the outbound Chinese tourism market, with aircraft operating directly to resort destinations such as Penang and Kota Kinabalu, he said. — Bloomberg                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Nepal PM phones India’s Modi over rupee chaos Google, Facebook cut ad revenue to ‘fake’ news sites European equities drift higher United to delay taking Boeing jets in US$4.8b savings push Macau sets US$25b gaming target for 2017 below estimates Oil slumps as prospect of Trump victory roils global markets Malaysia Airlines mulling purchase of 25 widebody jets next year Malaysia growth push stymied by banks cautious on loans US stocks decline after rally as election takes centre stage BNM: Ringgit fell against most world currencies in third quarter Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: Groin-flashing frog discovered in Australia An in-depth look at Mazda’s SKYACTIV-G engine Ah Beng reviews iguana’s epic escape from snakes (WARNING: EXPLICIT LANGUAGE) Ah Beng reviews iguana’s epic escape from snakes (WARNING: EXPLICIT LANGUAGE) Reuters Video: Philippines’ Duterte says ‘Long live Trump’ Did you know: The ocean is way deeper than you think Related Articles Malaysia Airlines mulling purchase of 25 widebody jets next year Malaysia Airlines bets on China, eyes 2019 IPO target More Malaysia-China flights to woo Chinese tourists First MAS GM dies at 81 MAS to fly to Kota Kinabalu, Kuching from Penang starting Nov 18 Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2016 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | RecomN - Local Services

 Wall Street is making a mistake about Ford CEO Mark Fields' plans for the future Matthew DeBord Oct. 17, 2016, 11:55 AM 4,363 facebook linkedin twitter email print Ford CEO Mark Fields.Ford See Also Ford Is Having A Bad Week, GM Is Having A Great One The Man Who Saved Ford From Bankruptcy May Retire Early Ford is buying Y Combinator shuttle-van startup Chariot in an all-cash deal Sales up, stock down. That's the reality at Ford these days, as the automaker has ridden a wave of recovering pickup truck and SUV sales, bouncing back from the darkest days of the Great Recession when General Motors and Chrysler — the other two members of the Detroit Big Three — went bankrupt. Ford shares, meanwhile, have slid 15% since the beginning of the year. The Wall Street Journal is starting to suggest that it might be CEO Mark Fields' fault.  Ford was famously rescued, without a government bailout or Chapter 11, by Alan Mulally, a former Boeing executive who took over at Ford before the financial crisis, quickly borrowed $25 billion, and articulated a "One Ford" plan that unified the entire company. The WSJ reported that since Fields took over in 2014, Ford has been headed toward a pivot under his leadership: to "Two Fords," one committed to the so-called "core" business of making and selling cars; the other seeking to establish Ford as a player in the future of mobility. Fields didn't just come to this realization — he's been pressing the idea at least for two years, but his efforts have intensified as many once-fanciful automotive technologies have gotten close to hitting the streets. Self-driving cars. Long-range electric vehicles. Vast ride-sharing services. Uber and Lyft are providing an alternative the the auto-industry's bedrock ownership model, and Detroit is starting to invest serious money in a Silicon-Valley powered vision of how we should get around. GM put $500 million into Lyft and bought Cruise Automation, a self-driving startup, while Ford just bought Chariot, a Bay Area van service and invested in a laser-radar company, Velodyne, to push autonomous tech forward. Back to basics? The assumption appears to be that Ford is getting out of its depth, away from basics, and that the markets want to see a return to the Mulally message: keep it simple. But it's not clear that if Fields jettisoned the futuristic talk, the markets would view Ford any more favorably. For years, the automaker has done nothing but sell highly profitable trucks and SUVs — and lots of them. And the stock has gone nowhere. (It was trading at $12 on Monday.) A tough year.Google Finance Practically speaking, Wall Street looks to be pricing in an auto downturn at some point in the next 12 months, at least predicting that there won't be additional sales growth in the US market, which set a record last year as 17.5 million vehicles rolled off dealer lots. But besides that, Fields hasn't really abandoned One Ford in any meaningful way. In fact, he can claim substantial credit for inspiring One Ford. Prior to Mulally's arrival in Dearborn, Fields came up with a plan he called the "Way Forward," which Mulally used as a basis for One Ford. It's more accurate to say that Fields is working to diversify One Ford so that Mulally's message can be flexibly applied to new opportunities, now that Ford isn't posting record quarterly losses. And he truly doesn't have a choice. There's agreement in the auto industry that although the traditional business is great, there's a major transformation afoot, and that anyone who ignores it to focus on the bottom line could get steamrolled. Fields saw Ford through the greatest crisis in its history. He isn't one to flirt with going there again.

Brown Norm Rothery Jason Heath Home Investing What Trump could mean for your portfolio What Trump could mean for your portfolio It makes for great TV. But for investors, the election is unnerving. Here’s how it could affect the markets   1 by Bryan Borzykowski October 17th, 2016 Online only.   1 Share: Facebook Twitter Google+ Share LinkedIn Email U.S. elections are known for their outsized hyperbole, but once the ballots are cast any lingering concerns about what it could mean for Canada-U.S. trade typically dissipate. But this is not your typical U.S. election. Canadian investors anxiously awaiting the outcome are smartly asking what it could mean for their portfolios. There is no shortage of bravado in the prognostications about what a Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton win would mean for the markets. Mark Cuban, tech entrepreneur and owner of the Dallas Mavericks, is convinced a Trump win would plunge stock markets and upend the bond market, should he find a way to follow through on a plan to renegotiate the U.S. national debt. Whereas Marc Faber, a respected market voice and author of the “Gloom, Boom & Doom Report”, cautions Clinton’s US$1 trillion tax hike “will destroy the whole world.” As divergent as these viewpoints are, the takeaway is clear: The outcome of the U.S. election will impact your money. Depending on who gets into the Oval Office, our economy, and our portfolios, could be in for a wild ride, even if it’s much less dramatic than the destruction of the world. If you’re looking for prognostications, there are hundreds—mostly in the event of a Republican win. Some have even the 13% run up in the S&P/TSX Composite this year is due in part to large U.S. investors positioning their portfolios in the event of a Trump win. Here’s a sample: Invest in companies that are sensitive to exchange rates like Dollarama and Baytex, because a Trump win would put pressure on the U.S. dollar and lift the loonie. Buy Lockheed Martin Corp., Northrop Grumman Corp. and Boeing Co., as they’d benefit from increased defence spending. Be on the lookout for The GEO Group, the private prison real estate investment trust, which would likely be an important cog in Trump’s pledge to round up and deport illegal immigrants. And lastly don’t forget Cemex, the Mexican cement company—because if they’re going to pay for the wall, then they aren’t going to buy American. For the political neophyte, reality TV has never been so captivating. For investors, it’s unnerving. If you’re rooting—or cringing—on the sidelines, Clinton is the better bet for your portfolio. Trump is such a divisive figure that markets around the world will likely experience more volatility under his watch, says Stephen Lingard, a portfolio manager with Franklin Templeton Solutions. The former First Lady, on the other hand, represents the status quo. Expect volatility if Trump beats the odds » Before you start altering your portfolio, here is a look at some of the larger ways a Clinton or Trump win would affect Canadian portfolios. Let’s start with Trump. Trump on trade Trump is trying to capitalize on a populist anti-trade sentiment in the U.S.  The Republican Presidential nominee’s feelings for the Trans-Pacific Partnership and the North American Free Trade Agreement is clear, repeatedly saying he would love to tear them up. At least when it comes to the TPP, Clinton and Trump appear to be somewhat on the same page. The Democratic Presidential Nominee agrees the TPP has its flaws, even though she once supported it, and now pledges to renegotiate the agreement if elected. Trade is the issue that will impact us the most, says Lingard. The North American economy has more than doubled in size since NAFTA was signed in 1994. According to Global Affairs Canada, “NAFTA has had an overwhelmingly positive effect on the Canadian economy,” and its increased trilateral trade within North American from $288 billion in 1993 to more than $1 trillion in 2015. If NAFTA changed in any significant way, Lingard says it could send Canada into a recession. Scrapping the TPP may not plunge Canada into recession since the agreement isn’t in force, but it could hobble future growth. In September, André Downs, chief economist at the department of Global Affairs Canada, said that the TPP would expand economic output by $4.3 billion thanks to increased access to hard-to-tap markets like Japan. Crossing the border could be harder under Trump » A Trump win would be positive for Canadian stocks Beyond trade, though, the differences between the two candidates are much more pronounced. Matthew Barasch a Canadian equity strategist at RBC Capital Markets, goes as far to say that Trump presidency would be good for Canada. Barasch zeros in on Trump’s tax cuts. “The broad cuts of the magnitude that Mr. Trump is calling for would most likely provide a big boost to the U.S. economy, at least for a period of time, and considering that the U.S. remains by far Canada’s largest trading partner, the flow through to Canadian growth would likely be fairly meaningful,” he writes in a note to clients. Are low interest rates doing more harm than good? If you are willing to put your portfolio before the environment then Trump is good news again. Barasch argues that Trump’s energy policy would be another positive for Canada. Trump is a major proponent of Keystone, a pipeline that would likely spur investment in the oil sands. Iran becomes another wildcard under a Trump presidency. “Should the nuclear agreement with Iran be jeopardized in any way and thus Iranian barrels be put at risk, the positive impact on oil prices could be significant,” writes Barasch in his note. On the flip side, Trump’s plan would reduce federal revenues by $9.5 trillion over 10 years, and that would require the government to massively reduce spending, which could negatively affect Americans, according to the Tax Policy Center. Will markets rally around Clinton? If Clinton gets elected, not much would change, says Bob Sewell, president and CEO of Oakville’s Bellwether Investment Management, though one policy that could impact Canadian health care companies is her desire to cap drug pricing. She’s also said that she’s against Keystone XL, but that she does want North America to invest more in clean energy, which our Prime Minister has expressed an interest in as well. Healthcare stocks might fall under Clinton, while energy companies and defence operations could see gains under Trump. It’s worth noting that overall, markets have done better under a Democrat president than a Republican one. On average, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has a 7% annualized return under a Democrat leader, while it’s only grown by 3% annualized under a Republican, according to Bespoke Investment Group. All that said, it’s likely that stocks will see more ups and downs as the election draws nearer, and especially if the race tightens even further, says Sewell. He’s getting more cautious and says that now’s not the time to be taking any sort of substantial risks. “Reduce your beta, reduce the volatility of your equity holdings and keep more cash in your pocket,” he says.   Share: Facebook Twitter Google+ Share LinkedIn Email Advertisement Advertisement    Show comments Hide comments (1) One comment on “What Trump could mean for your portfolio” Too many grammatical or spelling errors Reply ↓ Don Dutton on October 17, 2016 at 4:09 pm Leave a comment Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

Business Home LBoard UN body tells Putrajaya to let Bersih be FMT Reporters Read More FMT BAHASA FMT BORNEO+ FMT VIDEO CONTRIBUTE NEWS HOME NATION OPINION WORLD LEISURE SPORTS BUSINESS ADVERTISE WITH US Malaysia Airlines soars with London fare cuts FMT Reporters | October 19, 2016 Market share on Kuala Lumpur-London route has increased by 9 per cent in past 11 weeks, CEO Peter Bellow tells Bloomberg. KUALA LUMPUR: The fare reductions introduced by Malaysia Airlines for its Kuala Lumpur-London route is bearing fruit. Malaysia Airlines Bhd Chief Executive Officer Peter Bellew told Bloomberg the carrier’s market share had increased by 9 per cent in the past 11 weeks. Malaysia Airlines is selling return tickets between Kuala Lumpur and London for as little as 399 pounds (RM2,055), undercutting British Airways (BA) by 4 to 5 per cent. Bellew said it offered 2,000 seats a day on two Airbus Group SE A380 flights, versus about 500 at the UK carrier, which has a single Boeing Co 787 service. Passenger confidence slumped after two fatal crashes in 2014, but business has picked up since for Malaysia Airlines. It now accounts for 53 per cent of traffic between Kuala Lumpur and London, up from 40 per cent as recently as May. Bellew, who took over on July 1, told Bloomberg in an interview that BA had a 20 per cent market share. Gulf carriers control about 7 per cent of the market, with 3 per cent of people travelling via Singapore. Under Bellew, the carrier is revamping its fares to sell fewer bargain-basement tickets and offer less of a range between the highest and lowest prices, while discounting in strategically important markets such as the UK. Noting that BA was countering the price cuts, Bellew said Malaysia Airlines, which is seeking to return to profit in 2018, would take necessary measures to remain the “price leader” on the London route. British Airways said, in response to Bellew’s remarks, that it had “successfully relaunched” daily services between its Heathrow hub and Kuala Lumpur in May 2015. It said it could not disclose performance figures for individual routes because such information was “commercially sensitive,” Bloomberg reported. Business-class bookings for flights next year on Malaysia Airlines’ Asian routes were showing a strong increase, Bellew said. A further increase of 4 or 5 percentage points in the business-class load factor would allow the operation to break even in the fourth quarter of 2017 even with declining fares, he told Bloomberg.

Chief Executive Officer Peter Bellew said fare cuts aimed at boosting passenger numbers on Kuala Lumpur-London flights are bearing fruit, with the carrier’s market share up 9 percentage points in the past 11 weeks.

British Airways has a 20 percent market share, he said. Peter Bellew. Photographer: Simon Dawson/Bloomberg Malaysia Air has begun selling return tickets between Kuala Lumpur and London for as little as 399 pounds ($491), undercutting BA by 4 to 5 percent, Bellew said. It offers 2,000 seats a day on two Airbus Group SE A380 flights, versus about 500 at the U.K. carrier, which has a single Boeing Co. 787 service. Gulf carriers control about 7 percent of the market, with 3 percent of people traveling via Singapore, according to the CEO, who joined the company as chief operating officer in 2015 after spending nine years working under Ryanair Holdings Plc CEO Michael O’Leary. Malaysia Air is seeking to stimulate bookings after seeing demand collapse following 2014’s tragedies, when one jetliner vanished after veering off course and another was shot down over a war zone. Under Bellew, the carrier is revamping its fares to sell fewer bargain-basement tickets and offer less of a range between the highest and lowest prices, while discounting in strategically important markets such as the U.K. Business Boost Even though BA is countering the price cuts, Malaysia Air, which is seeking to return to profit in 2018, will take whatever steps are necessary to remain “price leader” on the London route, the CEO said. British Airways said in response to Bellew’s remarks that it “successfully relaunched” daily services between its Heathrow hub and Kuala Lumpur in May 2015, while adding that it cannot disclose performance figures for individual routes because such information is “commercially sensitive.” Business-class bookings for flights next year on Malaysia Air’s Asian routes are showing a strong increase, and the carrier remains committed to retaining a premium offering even as low-cost specialists led by local rival AirAsia Bhd. expand, Bellew said. A further increase of 4 or 5 percentage points in the business-class load factor would allow the operation to break even in the fourth quarter of 2017 even with declining fares, he said. The domestic Firefly unit, which operates a fleet of 12 Avions de Transport Regional ATR 72 turboprops, will be brought closer to the main airline by admitting it to the the Enrich frequent flyer program, making tickets interchangeable and more closely aligning fares, the executive said. Bellew said that Malaysia Air plans to add as many as five or six new routes to China from a shortlist of nine, with the first set to be announced before the end of November. The move will help deepen the carrier’s exposure to the outbound Chinese tourism market, with aircraft operating directly to resort destinations such as Penang and Kota Kinabalu, he said.

In the Indian psyche, the F-16 remains strongly linked with Pakistan The contest to supply the Indian Air Force (IAF) a single-engine, medium fighter is currently playing out as a two-horse race. US giant, Lockheed Martin, is the Goliath looking to slay the David that is Swedish firm, Saab. Lockheed Martin, which has offered to shift its F-16 production line to India, is the world's biggest defence firm, with $46.1 billion in sales last year and an order backlog of almost $100 billion. Saab, which has offered its latest fighter, the Gripen E, appears a relative minnow, with $3 billion in sales last year, and an order book of $12.9 billion. Yet, Saab is an extraordinarily accomplished minnow. Visitors to the Swedish Air Force Museum near Saab's aerospace facility at Linkoping, two hours by train from Stockholm, encounter an aerospace tradition that has, since 1926, kept pace with the world's best. The museum displays the J-29 "Flying Barrel", the first "swept-wing" fighter after World War II; the Draken, Europe's first supersonic fighter, which pioneered the "double delta wing", and the Viggen, the first mainstream fighter to feature the canard - now common in high-performance fighters. India came close to buying the Viggen but Washington, which provided the engines, blocked the sale in 1978. The IAF bought the Anglo-French Jaguar instead, which still remains in service. As Saab's marketing team never tires of telling Indians, this excellence in defence production stemmed from Sweden's traditional strategic independence - similar to India's. After remaining neutral through World War II, Sweden declined to join NATO in 1949, choosing to cater for its own defence against Russia. Responsible for its own defence, Sweden leveraged an existing scientific and engineering culture to develop an advanced aerospace and defence industry. In the late 1950s, the Swedish Air Force was the world's fourth largest, fielding over 1,000 frontline aircraft. Anticipating that a Soviet invasion would quickly render its airfields unusable, the Swedish Air Force insisted on light, versatile fighters that could operate from short stretches of highway, refuelling and rearming in minutes before re-joining battle. This is the tradition that shapes the JAS-39 Gripen E, Saab's latest and most advanced fighter that is expected to make its first flight by end-2016. Unlike Dassault's Rafale, which endured tortuous years of wait before Egypt became its first export customer, the Gripen E has been selected by Brazil even before its first flight. In winning the Brazil tender, the Gripen E beat the Rafale, and Boeing's F/A-18E/F Super Hornet. In sheer aerodynamic performance, the Gripen E will probably be a match for the F-16 Block 70. While the former has still to fly, its predecessor, the Gripen D, was extensively evaluated by the IAF - mainly to its satisfaction - as part of the 2007 medium multi-role combat aircraft (MMRCA) tender. The Gripen E, incorporating a new General Electric F-414 engine; is larger, heavier and more powerful than the Gripen D, which had an older F-404 power plant. Even the avionics are comparable. The F-16's Northrop Grumman APG-83 airborne electronically scanned array (AESA) radar is a proven, highly effective combat system. But the Gripen E could score with more sophisticated data networks that bring together inputs from multiple sensors - such as airborne warning and control systems (AWACS), satellites and a fighter's own AESA radar - fusing data to present a comprehensive picture of the air battle in a cockpit arrangement that is amongst the world's most pilot-friendly. With combat performance similar, the choice between the F-16 and Gripen E could boil down, as IAF boss, Air Chief Marshal Arup Raha said last month, to two factors - procurement and operating cost, and technology transfer. In procurement cost, Lockheed Martin would score by transferring a fully amortised assembly line from Forth Worth, Texas to India. Further, by creating a vendor and sub-vendor eco-system in India to sustain a global inventory of 3,200 F-16s, spares and maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) would be cheaper.

Photo: YouTube ALSO READ IAF kicks off contest to make single-engine fighters Gripen & F-16 compete in MMRCA re-run IAF inducts home-grown Tejas fighters Wake up on air defence The contest to supply the Indian Air Force (IAF) a single-engine, medium fighter is currently playing out as a two-horse race. US giant, Lockheed Martin, is the Goliath looking to slay the David that is Swedish firm, Saab. Lockheed Martin, which has offered to shift its F-16 production line to India, is the world's biggest defence firm, with $46.1 billion in sales last year and an order backlog of almost $100 billion. Saab, which has offered its latest fighter, the Gripen E, appears a relative minnow, with $3 billion in sales last year, and an order book of $12.9 billion. Yet, Saab is an extraordinarily accomplished minnow. Visitors to the Swedish Air Force Museum near Saab's aerospace facility at Linkoping, two hours by train from Stockholm, encounter an aerospace tradition that has, since 1926, kept pace with the world's best. The museum displays the J-29 "Flying Barrel", the first "swept-wing" fighter after World War II; the Draken, Europe's first supersonic fighter, which pioneered the "double delta wing", and the Viggen, the first mainstream fighter to feature the canard - now common in high-performance fighters. India came close to buying the Viggen but Washington, which provided the engines, blocked the sale in 1978. The IAF bought the Anglo-French Jaguar instead, which still remains in service. As Saab's marketing team never tires of telling Indians, this excellence in defence production stemmed from Sweden's traditional strategic independence - similar to India's. After remaining neutral through World War II, Sweden declined to join NATO in 1949, choosing to cater for its own defence against Russia. Responsible for its own defence, Sweden leveraged an existing scientific and engineering culture to develop an advanced aerospace and defence industry. In the late 1950s, the Swedish Air Force was the world's fourth largest, fielding over 1,000 frontline aircraft. Anticipating that a Soviet invasion would quickly render its airfields unusable, the Swedish Air Force insisted on light, versatile fighters that could operate from short stretches of highway, refuelling and rearming in minutes before re-joining battle. This is the tradition that shapes the JAS-39 Gripen E, Saab's latest and most advanced fighter that is expected to make its first flight by end-2016. Unlike Dassault's Rafale, which endured tortuous years of wait before Egypt became its first export customer, the Gripen E has been selected by Brazil even before its first flight. In winning the Brazil tender, the Gripen E beat the Rafale, and Boeing's F/A-18E/F Super Hornet. In sheer aerodynamic performance, the Gripen E will probably be a match for the F-16 Block 70. While the former has still to fly, its predecessor, the Gripen D, was extensively evaluated by the IAF - mainly to its satisfaction - as part of the 2007 medium multi-role combat aircraft (MMRCA) tender. The Gripen E, incorporating a new General Electric F-414 engine; is larger, heavier and more powerful than the Gripen D, which had an older F-404 power plant. Even the avionics are comparable.

While U.S. military drone spending will continue growing, a recent regulatory breakthrough from the Federal Aviation Association (FAA) sets the stage for commercial drone sales to eclipse military spending and become one of the fastest growing industries in the world in the next five years. A Regulatory Breakthrough The commercial drone industry scored a big win in late August. That was the day the Federal Aviation Association (FAA) opened up the skies to commercial drones. The FAA ruling allows for small commercial drones to operate during daylight and below 400 feet. That alone is a regulatory breakthrough for the commercial drone industry. But the FAA also recently loosened its restriction on commercial drone pilots. Before, a commercial drone pilot needed an actual pilot license. Now, commercial drone pilots will only be required to pass a test that costs $150. These key regulatory adjustments clear the path for the most powerful S&P 500 companies to invest billions of dollars into their commercial drone programs. In fact, it’s already happening. Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) is testing Amazon Prime Air, its system to use drones to fulfill local deliveries, in Canada, the UK and the Netherlands. Now that the FAA has opened up the U.S. skies to commercial drones, Amazon hopes to fully launch Prime Air in the United States in 2017 or 2018. The cost savings of Amazon’s drone program are astronomical. According to Deutsche Bank (DB), this is how the cost of using drones to deliver a shoebox sized package compares to more traditional methods: • Premium ground like UPS or FedEx: $6 to $6.50 • Mid-tier carriers like OnTrac: $4 to $5 • USPS for last mile alone: about $2 • Robots/drones: less than 5 cents per mile of delivery These cost savings are the reason commercial drones are expected to be one of the fastest growing industries in the world in the next five years. A recent report from consulting firm PriceWaterhouseCoopers predicts that the global market for commercial applications will grow to $127 billion by 2020 from just $2 billion today. One way to profit from the booming drone industry is with large defense contractors such as Lockheed Martin Corporation (LMT) or Boeing Co (BA). However, I see a problem with these global leaders. 7 Stocks to Buy That Will Grow by Double Digits Not only is the military drone market growing slower than the commercial drone market, these companies are so large that even mega growth in their drone divisions isn’t enough to have a material impact on earnings. A better way to invest in drones is with my favorite ‘pick and shovel’ company operating on the commercial side of the drone industry. Ambarella Inc (AMBA) is a leader in HD video chips. Its customers are some of the biggest players in the drone and mobile HD video markets. That includes industry leader GoPro Inc (GRPO). The reason I like Ambarella is because it’s a pick and shovel play on the drone industry, selling components to the companies that build drones as opposed to actually building them in house. That makes the company a broad play on the drone industry, and a direct play on the FAA’s recent regulatory breakthroughs. Ambarella has already had an incredible run. Shares are up 943% in the last five years. Take a look at the chart below. However, this is the best time to invest in the past two years. Ambarella recently fell 50% from its all-time high. More importantly, its forward P/E ratio of 24 is a 45% discount from its all-time high in 2015. Looking forward, Ambarella is on a clear upward trajectory. Analysts are projecting 40% earnings growth to $2.16 per share next year. Risks To Consider: Expectations for the commercial drone industry is running high. That shows up in the high valuation of many of the early industry leaders. Stocks with higher valuation can take a beating if they fall short of lofty short-term expectations. Halliburton Company (HAL) Stock Is Ready for a Comeback Action To Take: Ambarella is a global leader supplying HD video chips to the commercial drone industry. Although Ambarella is far from a value stock, its forward P/E ratio of 24 is more than a 45% discount to its all-time high. I am expecting shares to beat the S&P 500 in the next three to five years. In the short run look to buy under $70. Editor’s Note: Looking for other ways to get in on the ground floor of a booming industry? A life-saving device could soon be rolled out to 5,627 hospitals and medical facilities across the country. It’s already at work in California, where it is on track to save 15,000 lives this year. And only one tiny company produces it. This puts it in control of a $34.5 billion market. How much you stand to gain as an investor is staggering.

Lockheed Martin could build new training jets for the U.S. Air Force more quickly than its competitors — enough to save $1 billion over six years, a top company executive said. And the service ought to take that into account as it evaluates bids for the $15 billion T-X project, he said. “What we’re concerned about, frankly, is that the Air Force in their competition right now is not recognizing the value of early delivery or even on-time delivery,” said Rob Weiss, Lockheed executive vice president and general manager of Advanced Development Programs. Lockheed is running its pursuit of the contract through Weiss’s group, the secretive division better known as the Skunk Works, birthplace of the U-2 spyplane, SR-71 Blackbird, and F-117 stealth fighter. Here’s how the firm calculates the $1 billion in savings: The Air Force says it wants the first 16 planes ready to train pilots by 2024, but Lockheed says it could deliver the planes three years early. That would allow the Air Force to start getting rid of its T-38 Talon trainers sooner. Subscribe Receive daily email updates: Subscribe to the Defense One daily. Be the first to receive updates. That means not as many Talons will need structural and other upgrades. But it also means the Air Force can start shedding a costly two-step training program that puts fighter-pilots-to-be in the 1960s-vintage Talon, then the higher-performance F-16, before they reach the fifth-generation F-22 and F-35 jets. By contrast, the modern T-X will offer the full range of undergraduate pilot training. “Presumably, the Air Force is trying to make this a cost shootout, but they’re not looking at the additional costs that are being incurred by continuing training in an antiquated system,” Weiss said. “You’re really not shattering the cost curve if you’re having to spend potentially another billion dollars on maintaining your legacy training system while you wait on a new system.” Read more Skunk Works Chief: How To Keep America’s Airborne Advantage See also Sikorsky’s New Ace in the Hole: Lockheed’s Skunk Works Lockheed officials say an internal study has validated its decision to enter the T-X bidding not with a clean-sheet design by a modified version of the T-50, a training jet jointly made by Lockheed and KAI in Korea for Seoul’s air force. The T-X version would get an all-new digital cockpit and a port for aerial refueling. “What we did see is that [an all-new plane] was going to take a whole lot longer to develop, to test, to certify and to field, and we’ve never wavered from that position,” Weiss said. This is also the approach taken by one rival in the T-X bidding, a team of Raytheon and Italy’s Leonardo that is offering a version of the M-346, but not Northrop Grumman and Boeing (with help from Saab), which are offering new planes. Weiss says history shows that new-design planes often arrive late. They require certification from the military, the Federal Aviation Administration certification, or both. (While Weiss did not mention it specifically, Lockheed’s own F-35 took far longer than expected to arrive. That said, training jets are considered far less complicated.) Executives in all camps have remained relatively tight-lipped since a list of draft parameters was announced in July. But privately, they have griped that the Air Force is not giving extra credit in the right places. Northrop Grumman and Boeing tout their tailor-made aircraft, built to military specification using more modern manufacturing techniques. These might cost more money up front, they argue, but are a better value in the long term. Lockheed and Raytheon-Leonardo say their planes will meet the Air Force specs faster with much lower risk. Weiss’ comments this week mark the first time a top executive has laid out specific factors a firm would like the Air Force to change when it puts out a finalized list of bidding paraments before Christmas. What does the Air Force think? Service officials say they want to make sure the competition is open to all bidders in an attempt to get the best bang for its buck. Their draft bidding parameters stress the desire to buy a plane that is low risk to build. (Earlier this year, we told you why picking a new training jet is so difficult). “We’re looking for balance. And the balance that we would like to see in the [bidding parameters] would provide recognition of the true value of having early or at least on-time delivery,” Weiss said.

Lots of positive, upbeat noises about intentions, visions, common purposes and long-term objectives drifted into the public realm from day one of the much-touted Springbok Indaba ... would you have expected anything less? But as the two-day venture draws to its scheduled conclusion on Thursday, and SA coach Allister Coetzee begins the tricky task of soaking in abundant advice and theory from a nationwide cast of dozens and then pulling the stuff together for the pot, I suspect there will ultimately be no escape for him from one cold fact: the Bok buck still stops with him. It has been brave, and generous, of him to allow such a forum even as his first year in the post - when at least some reasonable leeway must be granted for familiarisation - awaits completion yet. The word “bizarre”, I admit, is also not terribly far from my thinking on the exercise, whatever good it may bring. Many considerably more ego-driven sports coaches (and that is a characteristic that barely springs to mind with “Toetie”) would not even countenance the idea, let alone so soon into their tenure. Observers of more cynical mind could even be tempted to charge that the Indaba, which he staunchly advocated, signals a worrisome decline - already - in his self-confidence in the unforgiving national post. Coetzee overwhelmingly gave the impression he knew what he was doing during his predominantly successful stint as Stormers coach, making few excuses for a largely pragmatic approach that won him many more matches than he lost … even if his team’s style meant he earned qualified respect rather than rapturous appreciation for his methods. Remember that three times he effectively won the “real Currie Cup” of modern times by steering his charges to supremacy when the South African Super Rugby teams were all housed in a single conference. Even when they slipped up, his sides were not easily broken down. That phenomenon has changed disturbingly for the worse in his maiden year in charge of the Boks thus far, with mostly nerve-jangling wins when they’ve been fortunate enough to present themselves (just four times) and the five reverses including stingingly large ones to the All Blacks. Led a provocative, frankly distracting dance by the Lions’ seemingly futuristic displays in much of Super Rugby 2016, this year’s Boks have all too stubbornly negotiated a dusty, potholed road to nowhere in playing manner, gravely torpedoing time-honoured, core traditions like physical mastery and staunch defence in an airy-fairy, currently rank indecisive quest for a more fluid game. Coetzee has allowed his convictions and principles to stray into a dangerous vacuum; his Bok teams have been ill-fitting jigsaws structurally, sometimes simply featuring wrong horses, full-stop, or the incorrect ones for very particular courses. The coach has ill-advisedly tried to be all things to all people, hammering together a hybrid of Boeing and Airbus parts, if you like, and hoping the darned concoction shudders off the ground. Somehow, and I won’t have been alone, I just knew the Boks were destined to have an evening of great Durban discomfort against New Zealand recently when he kept faith, for instance, in the highly attack-limited Morne Steyn at flyhalf - but then didn’t back the move up by assembling the correct personnel for a conservative strategy around him. He kept a cruiserweight “roamer” at No 8 in the shape of Warren Whiteley, and fielded blindside flanks Oupa Mohoje and Willem Alberts the wrong way around by starting with the athlete and bringing on the bruiser pretty much after the cause was lost. Outside of Steyn, too, Coetzee fielded a back division collectively way too economical in both muscle and inches - including a scrumhalf at wing - to be able to remotely boss All Black counterparts in confrontation. Watch the game again: you will quickly see that the world champions didn’t just revel against the Boks because of their acclaimed, silky hand-to-hand stuff … they also had a veritable field day in physical domination across the park. No amount of debate around the financial limitations of central contracting in South Africa, or fitness levels among Bok Test players increasingly drawn from far and wide on the planet - and yes, I concede these are vexing, impeding matters - disguises elementary, avoidable errors in team selection. Whether the Indaba produces benefits, or no benefits at all, ultimately the current fog the Springboks are floundering in has to be cleared by Allister Coetzee, and no one else who had his name on a table near a writing pad and water jug at a Newlands hotel this week. It’s about the man in the mirror, not the shifting shadows or raised hands, either helpful or confusing, behind him. A much more than competent cricketer in his own sporting heyday, Coetzee is capable of crisper stroke-play in his current job without the need for broader intellectual input. If the Boks go one from three, say, in their fast-looming trio of European Tests, an already disenchanted SA rugby public won’t be lauding lofty, down-the-line ideals from a Capetonian think-tank held a few weeks earlier. Believe me, their focus will be much, much narrower than that. *Follow our chief writer on Twitter: @RobHouwing Read more on:    springboks  |  allister coetzee  |  rugby NEXT ON SPORT24X Boks will improve for Italy 2016-11-15 22:31 Follow Sport24 on Twitter, Facebook, Mobile and on Instagram What To Read Next {{item.title}}   Read News24’s Comments Policy Live Video Streaming Blitz Mon, 24 Nov 2014 @00:00 SuperSport 1 Mon, 24 Nov 2014 @01:00 SuperSport 2 Mon, 24 Nov 2014 @02:00 SuperSport 3 Mon, 24 Nov 2014 @03:00 Show full schedule Video Highlights Australia v SA: 1st Test, Day 4 Tue, 15 Nov 2016 @00:00 Bok forwards want to lay foundation Tue, 15 Nov 2016 @17:34 Italy battered and bruised by All Blacks Tue, 15 Nov 2016 @17:32 Lots to work on before tour conclusion Tue, 15 Nov 2016 @11:34 Show more videos Sport Talk We need to draw a line in the sand As the anger and discontent over the Springbok performance at Twickenham continues to simmer, the...

When DeMont collapsed at a bus stop in front of the UW Medical Center on his morning commute, Dahl was one of 41 people within a 330-yard radius who happened to have a cell phone app alerting them to the emergency.

(AP Photo/Elaine Thompson)  (Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.) If your heart is going to stop, right outside a hospital is not a bad place for it. And if 41 people within a 330-yard radius have a cellphone app alerting them to your distress, so much the better. That's what happened in Seattle last week when Stephen DeMont collapsed at a bus stop in front of University of Washington Medical Center. While a medical student rushed over and began chest compressions, a cardiac nurse just getting off her shift was alerted by her phone, sprinted outside and assisted until paramedics arrived. Five days later, DeMont, 60, is walking, smiling and talking about how the PulsePoint app helped save his life. More on this... Smartphone app helps man save baby's life Coach administering CPR suffers heart attack after Texas swimmer dies Teen performs life-saving CPR on friend at baseball practice Seattle officials say the rescue shows the potential the free download has for connecting CPR-trained citizens with patients who urgently need their help. It's being used in 2,000 U.S. cities in 28 states. "I put it on my phone yesterday," said DeMont's wife, Debi Quirk, a former registered nurse. "He would not be here as we see him today." Seattle officials hope DeMont's story will help persuade thousands more people to sign up for notifications; so far, about 4,000 people in Seattle have downloaded PulsePoint since the city adopted it earlier this year with financial support from an employee charitable fund at Boeing. The goal is to have 15,000 using it. Developed by a former fire chief in Northern California, Richard Price, the app works through a city's 911 system. When a call comes in, operators alert people within a certain radius that CPR assistance is needed, along with the location of the nearest portable defibrillator. About 900,000 people around the country have downloaded and carry the app, and 34,000 people have been activated to respond, he said, adding that alerts have been issued in 13,000 cardiac events. He came up with the idea in 2009, he said. He was in a restaurant when he heard sirens from his crews at the San Ramon Valley fire department. As he wondered where they were going, they arrived at the restaurant. "The patient was unconscious, unresponsive. I was 20 feet away on the other side of the wall," Price said. "The whole time I was listening to that siren, I could have been making a difference." It occurred to him that at any given time, two-thirds of his staff was off duty — in restaurants, out in the community. If there was a way to alert them to such emergencies by phone, it could save lives, Price said. It's not clear how many lives have been saved thanks to the app. Patient confidentiality laws often prevent hospitals from disclosing a patient's outcome. Madeline Dahl, a 23-year-old cardiac nurse at the University of Washington Medical Center, said she downloaded the app about a month ago after reading a news story that mentioned it. Last Friday morning was the first time she'd ever received an alert. She bolted down a couple flights of stairs and ran outside into the rain, where she found 27-year-old medical student Zach Forcade performing chest compressions. Forcade had been on his way into the hospital for a lecture when he saw DeMont, who was just getting off his bicycle, slump over. "I hadn't responded to a cardiac arrest before," Forcade said. "I thought, 'Did he just fall?' ... Even being in the medical field, I thought, 'Oh, man, who's going to step up?'" He told another passerby to call 911, which triggered an alert sent out to 41 responders nearby. It was reassuring when Dahl arrived to provide any needed backup, help check for a pulse and otherwise make sure Forcade was responding correctly, he said. For DeMont, it was about more than just being lucky. A contract technical writer at Expedia, he said he has a love-hate relationship with technology — "You see all these things about people falling off cliffs texting, people are so disconnected" — but the response from Forcade, Dahl and the use of PulsePoint reaffirmed his belief in its power to make a positive difference. "There's hope," DeMont said. He's due to have a defibrillator implanted on Thursday. Now he just has to figure out how to pay the $100,000 tab without insurance. For that, his family has turned to a program with a different app: GoFundMe.

ExoMars, a joint mission between the European Space Agency and Roscosmos, the Russian space agency, has the main goal of exploring "whether life has ever existed on Mars," according to the ESA. The mission launched a trace gas orbiter (TGO) and the Schiaparelli module toward Mars in March of this year, and the TGO began orbiting Mars today. The Schiaparelli module was expected to land on the planet's surface, but contact was lost after it entered the planet's atmosphere, officials said. Scientists said they hoped to re-establish contact with the module.

Schiaparelli's mission is to land on the planet and "test key technologies" in preparation for future ESA Mars missions.

Equal parts luxury automobile and space shuttle, the company’s flagship on-highway tractor has received a facelift and fine-tuning for the 2018 model year. Officially unveiled in September, I was able to take the new tractor on a roughly 200 mile jaunt through the Nevada desert and into California earlier this month with “out with the old, in with the new” on full display. Departing Henderson, Nevada, the first leg of the trip was mostly at highway speeds. The drive southbound on Interstate 15 provided fertile hunting ground to test Detroit’s refined adaptive cruise. The DT12’s skip-shift feature got my 400-horsepower DD15 up to speed quickly. I was following another 2018 Cascadia on the drive and used it as my pace vehicle. As we approached 65 mph, I set the cruise and tucked myself in line behind it. For 10 miles or more, I barely touched the brake or accelerator. When the truck ahead of me slowed, my Cascadia applied the engine brake to maintain a two-second-plus following distance, seamlessly doing the same when a car cut between us and disrupted the original two-second interval. At no point did I ever feel I had ceded control to the truck, and as we exited the highway, I let the adaptive cruise handle all of the deceleration; I only applied the Bendix disc brakes to hold us at the red light at the end of the ramp. Detroit’s fourth-generation Intelligent Powertrain Management uses GPS-based technology to maximize the DT12’s fuel economy performance by anticipating changes to road terrain. All of that happens without you really knowing it until you slip your fuel card into the pump. A brief stop to rotate trucks turned into a tourist attraction. About halfway into the drive, we pulled off onto a state highway in a Joshua Tree forest to shoot some pictures, an idea we shared with a large group of French tourists – a collection of about 50 people loosely scattered among the trees snapping photos of each other. By the time I could climb out of the cab, we became part of the roadside attraction. The dense groves of Joshua Trees emptied of tourists who now were snapping pictures of themselves with the truck – some on the outside, some in the driver’s seat. The French version of Facebook, I’m sure, was flooded with new profile pictures minutes later. Several dozen handshakes and a blast of the air horn later, we point the two-truck convoy toward Searchlight, Nevada. Back on the road, we found several long grades to challenge the Detroit powertrain, which responded to everything I threw at it. The smart-shifting DT12 consistently found the right power band from the 1,750 lb.-ft. of torque to get us up and back down as winds cut across the dry valleys. Standard enhancements that all minimize drag and dial down in-cab noise include an upper door seal, elliptical-shaped mirrors, a sloped hood, a bumper with an integrated air deflector and integrated antennas. Conversation in the cab was easy thanks to a third door seal and 3M’s Thinsulate; I’ve been in passenger cars with more wind noise. Freightliner worked with Teague, a designer of Boeing airplane interiors, to develop lighting, storage and ergonomic features. The result of that collaboration is a cab that feels more like a cockpit, with switches and controls intuitively placed within easy reach. The transmission and three-stage engine brake can be controlled via a blinker-style switch on the steering column, and ceiling-mounted LED lights offer more ambient cabin illumination to reduce eye strain. The new 5-inch instrument display, which is located front-and-center of the driver in the instrument cluster, is handy. With so much information available via a steering wheel-mounted toggle, I originally thought this might prove more distraction than beneficial. It’s easy to geek out with so much cool technology at your fingertips, but the ability to select which information is most important to you – from tire pressure to axle load – makes it easy to distinguish data with a quick glance downward. The one-piece windshield delivers an unexpected boost in visibility, as does the elimination of splits in the side windows. That’s a benefit you don’t really notice until you’re in the driver’s seat. Visibility in the previous-generation Cascadia wasn’t bad; it just wasn’t this good. My test truck was outfitted with the Elite Package, which included Oregon Ash wood-grain trim accents. My red sleeper also featured vented seats, a factory-installed refrigerator, a 40-inch liftable lower bunk, a flat-screen television mount, a 1,500-watt Xantrex inverter, an upper cargo shelf, the ParkSmart HVAC system with optimized idle, a full-size microwave cabinet, front and side overhead storage cabinets and a dimmable LED ambient light bar. Cascadia’s new front suspension – a 12,500-monoleaf design – provides a smoother ride and improved roll stiffness, and the steering gear was relocated further forward; that small change improved steering precision to a point that it rivals Freightliner’s German-engineered C-Class cousins. The Detroit Assurance 4.0 suite of safety systems includes Active Brake Assist that now provides full braking on stationary objects, Adaptive Cruise Control and Lane Departure Warning with optional video capture. The proprietary safety suite includes driver-friendly controls and is integrated seamlessly into the truck’s dashboard, engine and transmission electronics and can enhance driver safety by mitigating collisions. Thankfully, my three-hour drive was mostly uneventful, and I didn’t need to test much of this system beyond the audible lane departure warning. When Freightliner first introduced the Cascadia in May 2007, the company said it would offer 3 percent fuel savings over the Columbia and Century Class models that it ultimately would supplant. Freightliner estimates the integrated powertrain on the new truck will deliver 8 percent better fuel economy performance over the current-model Cascadia Evolution. Fuel efficiency gains are driven mostly by powertrain technology advancements and aerodynamic refinements, the fruits of Daimler Trucks North America’s participation in the U.S. Department of Energy’s SuperTruck project. My fully loaded Detroit 40K axle 6X2 averaged about 10 mpg, but we hit little traffic on the drive. It takes a lot of guts to completely reinvent a truck that is already the most efficient product on the road, especially when you consider that a 40 percent-plus market share is on the line. But with the 2018 Cascadia, Freightliner has hit home runs in style, efficiency and comfort.

Hide Caption 10 of 11 Photos: The plane that emits only water vapor Future air taxis – The researchers envision that the technology will be used to power regional inter-city flights used as air taxis in the near future. Hide Caption 11 of 11 Story highlights World's first 4-seater fuel cell plane took first flight Aircraft's only emission is water vapor Tech may be used to power air taxis in the near future (CNN)The dream of sustainable air travel is now one step closer to reality, after a team of researchers in Germany flew a plane that emits nothing but water vapor into the atmosphere. The plane runs on fuel cells -- devices producing an electrical current from a supply of hydrogen and oxygen -- aided by a battery for extra oomph during takeoff. The four-seater aircraft, called HY4, had its maiden flight from Stuttgart Airport in Germany in September. It's the result of a collaboration between aircraft manufacturer Pipistrel, fuel cell specialists Hydrogenics, the University of Ulm and the German Aerospace Center (DLR)'s Institute of Engineering and Thermodynamics. "This is the first time that somebody has built an airplane that can carry more than one person and which is driven by hydrogen," says Andre Thess, director of the Institute of Engineering Thermodynamics at DLR, who sees HY4 as a major leap toward decarbonizing air travel. The 'air taxi' of the future? Emission-free planes could be the air taxis of the future Read More The team aims to use fuel cells to power small and medium-sized passenger planes, which could change regional air travel and provide an alternative to carbon-emitting airplanes, buses and trains. Josef Kallo, HY4 project leader at DLR and a professor at the University of Ulm, thinks we could also see emission-free air taxis flying from city to city within the next 20 years. "Say you want to go between Irvine and Ventura in the Los Angeles area. It can take you between one and a half and three hours if there are traffic jams, but by plane it will take you around 35 to 40 minutes. "And within a controlled airspace you could have a lot of these planes flying around." The electrical system is also very quiet compared to conventional planes, as it does not have the same loud combustion roar as a jet engine, which makes it ideal for flying near residential areas, Kallo says. "I can envision having a lot of these planes landing in the middle of Los Angeles, for example." The team are also looking at placing the system in larger aircraft. HY4 is powered by a hybrid fuel cell Kallo, a pilot himself, says a 40-seater flying a distance of a thousand kilometers may not be far off. The ultimate goal is to cut carbon emissions from air travel, the researchers say. Although aviation contribute around 2% to the overall total of global greenhouse gas emissions, for someone looking to cut their personal carbon footprint, flying plays a major part. A flight from London to New York generates roughly as much emissions per person as the average European generates by heating their home for a whole year, according to the European Commission. Controlled explosions The aircraft is powered by a hybrid fuel cell and battery system. The fuel cells mix a supply of hydrogen and oxygen, which trigger a controlled explosion. This generates an electrical current to power the motor which drives the propeller. Researchers turn old plastic bottles into fuel The battery supplies additional power required for takeoff and climbing. The fuel cell itself is not unlike the science experiments mixing hydrogen and oxygen to spark a small explosion that some may remember from school, Thess says: "But there is no bang. Just electricity and water vapor as the exhaust gas. It's a way of taming this explosion and extracting electric energy directly from hydrogen and oxygen." NASA technology Fuel cells are reliable and provide a steady power flow while cruising, but they are not ideal for quick power boosts, which is where the battery comes in handy for takeoff and emergencies, Thess says. "In the unlikely event that all fuel cells break down, the power of the battery would still be sufficient for a safe emergency landing." Electric cars and NASA space shuttles already use hydrogen fuel cells for power. The system could theoretically be placed into any small or medium-sized aircraft, according to Thess. "In a similar way that a Rolls Royce engine can be attached to a Boeing Airbus, our battery hybrid fuel cell systems can in principle be integrated into any aircraft that's already powered with a battery or other means." The four-seater plane has a maximum distance of 1,500 kilometers Short range The maiden flight was the first step in showing off this technology to the world. Next on the plane's schedule is a tour around Europe and a flight between San Francisco and New York next year. Can a whole country run on renewable energy? There are limits, however, and researchers will spend the next three years testing the system's potential and find out just how high it can go and how it reacts to different temperatures and rapid changes in power requirements. This plane has an estimated range of 1,500 kilometers, but with a larger plane this could soon increase, Thess says. "Over the next few years DLR will work on developing a 19 passenger electrically powered aircraft." With energy storage among the main limitations, those hoping to fly long haul in an electric aircraft will have to wait. "The vision of having a thousand passengers go 10,000 kilometers could be feasible in 50 years or so," Kallo says. "Today, the maximum range is around 2,000 kilometers, but if I'm wrong, that would be nice." Content by LendingTree Rates hit 2.75% APR (15 yr).

After Trump mused that he might meet with the Russian leader immediately after winning the election, the Clinton camp pounced. “It's unclear why Donald Trump needs to meet with Vladimir Putin on Nov. 9 since he's already repeating all his talking points, pushing his policy agenda and taking advantage of his espionage operation,” Clinton spokesman Glen Caplin said in a statement released Tuesday. Clinton’s campaign again dinged Trump for his praise of Putin by promising that Clinton would “stand up to Putin in the face of his unacceptable behavior, not coddle him." Story Continued Below TRUMP (DIS)ORGANIZATION? — A security researcher is calling attention to vulnerable servers used by the Trump Organization, an umbrella group for the presidential candidate’s businesses. Among the sins pointed out by Kevin Beaumont: It’s running Windows Server 2003, which Microsoft stopped providing security updates for more than a year ago. “Running outdated software and operating systems for your publicly facing email infrastructure is problematic, especially when you're a high-profile organization,” Beaumont told Motherboard Tuesday. “During an election where cybersecurity is such a big issue, I was a little amazed at what I saw.” The Trump Organization defended itself in a statement: "The Trump Organization deploys best-in-class firewall and anti-vulnerability technology with constant 24/7 monitoring. Our infrastructure is vast and leverages multiple platforms, which are consistently monitored and upgraded using current cybersecurity best practices."

THE BEST DEFENSE IS A GOOD OFFENSE — As the world waits for the first clear sign of a U.S. response to the DNC hack, a White House cyber policy official promised Tuesday that the Obama administration was taking its deterrence responsibility seriously. “We realize that making defenses stronger isn’t enough,” Andrew Grotto, the National Security Council’s senior director for cybersecurity policy, said at FedScoop’s FEDTalks conference. Grotto acknowledged the need to use “all available tools” to disrupt and deter malicious actors, echoing frequently used administration language. “We have established a robust framework to guide and support these disruptive efforts,” Grotto added, pointing to, among other things, a 2012 presidential policy directive that established basic cyberspace principles. “Our policy is one of restraint,” Grotto promised, noting that there is a “robust” oversight process governing offensive cyber actions. And in a nod to the oft-stated difficulty of conducting attribution in cyberspace, Grotto said, “We’re investing heavily in our ability to attribute malicious cyber [activities], and we’re getting pretty good at it.” WATCHING THE WATCHMEN — “Despite spending hundreds of millions of dollars on security upgrades, U.S. media organizations have failed to properly protect their newsrooms from cyberattacks on their websites, communications systems and even editing platforms — opening themselves up to a chaos-creating hack around Election Day,” Darren Samuelsohn and Hadas Gold report for POLITICO. “In just the last month, BuzzFeed has been vandalized, and both Newsweek and a leading cybersecurity blog were knocked offline after publishing articles that hackers apparently didn’t appreciate. Federal law enforcement is investigating multiple attacks on news organizations, and journalists moderating the presidential debates say they’ve even gotten briefings from the FBI on proper cyber hygiene, prompting them to go back to paper and pens for prep work.” More here. YAHOO EARNINGS SOLID, BUT QUESTIONS LINGER — After a tumultuous period that included a massive hack affecting 500 million users and reports of a program that scans user messages per a government request, Yahoo announced third-quarter earnings (minus certain expenses) of 20 cents per share — profits that beat analyst expectations of 14 cents per share, Bloomberg reports. But, as Recode pointed out: “While it looks like a big beat, this result is primarily due to cost cuts and not massive growth in its businesses.” Yahoo canceled its earnings call, which meant no answers on the hack, the-who-knew-what-when or potential impact on the pending Verizon deal, which Verizon believes is now open to renegotiation. “We are busy preparing for integration with Verizon,” Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer said in a statement. FANCY BEAR ON THE PROWL — The Russian hacking group that cybersecurity researchers say was behind this summer’s DNC hack is at it again. ThreatConnect on Tuesday published a new blog post that details how “Fancy Bear,” which is believed to be connected to Russia’s military, carried out a spearphishing campaign against Bellingcat, a citizen journalist website based in the United Kingdom. Researchers at the security vendor performed a technical analysis of the domains, IP addresses, servers and registrants involved in the digital attack and found it synced up with Fancy Bear’s tactics, techniques and procedures. ** A message from Intuit Tax and Financial Center: Watch our video series – Talking Tax with Intuit – featuring experts with diverse experience in tax policy.

But *SPOILER ALERT* the problem has only grown worse. “Multiple new Mirai botnets have accumulated an additional 280,000 bots, bringing the count of Mirai bots to 493,000,” according to a blog post the firm published on Tuesday. “The true number of actual bots may be higher based on an incomplete view of the infrastructure.” HACKING UNDERWATER DRONES — That was a topic of discussion at a Tuesday forum sponsored by Boeing, Northrop Grumman, Elbit Systems and the Institute for Defense and Government Advancement on unmanned undersea vehicles. Participants at the Unmanned Maritime Systems conference in Arlington, Va., emphasized the need to make underwater drones "cyber proof" to prevent adversaries from taking control of their systems. "Right now, I can say it's not as secure as it needs to be," said one participant, who, like the others, operated under the Chatham House Rule protecting the identity and affiliation of speakers.

Coverage of Disruptive Science and Technology Forum About Contact Facebook twitter Google October 17, 2016 Lockheed proposes stealth fighter project with Mitsubishi Heavy air force, aircraft, japan, military, united states Facebook Twitter linkedin google Reddit Lockheed Martin has proposed developing a new Japanese stealth fighter with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, the U.S. defense giant's president told The Nikkei. Lockheed Martin's proposal was made in response to a call from Japan's Ministry of Defense, which is weighing options to boost Japan's defensive capabilities in the face of rising regional tensions. Japan is looking to replace its aging fleet of around 90 F-2 fighters and is mulling three possibilities. The first would be for Japan to develop a new jet domestically. The second would be co-development with foreign defense contractors, such as Lockheed Martin. The third would be to buy more existing aircraft -- say, Lockheed Martin's F-35 stealth jet. The Japanese ministry's deliberations are ongoing, with a second round of information requests to be made by the end of next March. "We will definitely respond [to this request], we will be a part of that process," Hewson said. A final decision is expected in fiscal 2018. Lockheed Martin rival Boeing has also proposed working with MHI on a replacement for the F-2. Alternatively, the Japanese contractor could opt to go it alone with its experimental stealth fighter, which made its maiden flight in April. Japan has already purchased 42 F-35s from Lockheed Martin to replace its F-4 fleet. The F-35 was originally developed by the U.S. and eight other countries, including the U.K. and Italy, in what has been described as the world's largest weapons program.

The Tax Policy Review Committee said it’s not about finding new money but making policies more fair to taxpayers. State representatives heard from local business owners and school districts protesting Act 388, which was passed 10 years ago. “What I am asking you, as a small business owner, I’m asking you for some relief we’ve provided to all other aspects of our society,” said Anderson County business owner Rockey Burgess. “And, with current legislations, we’ve not given relief to local folks like myself that are in small business. If we don’t get that relief, I’m telling you, more businesses such as mine, I employ on average 15 to 20 people, we’ll be shutting our doors.” The law reduces property tax to homeowners in exchange for a higher sales tax by one penny. Some say it’s a solution to taking the burden of funding schools off homeowners, but some school districts say it cripples their budgets. Others say it’s a business killer. “It’s been atrocious for local business,” Burgess said. “I’m a small business owner. I don’t have the economic incentives that are offered to your larger companies such as BMW, Boeing, all those others that have came into our state. With that being said, I’m faced with rising taxes.” One lawmaker suggested adjusting sales tax to two percent and eliminating exemptions. “Reducing the sales tax and income tax along with removing the exemptions to looking at the whole package,” said Berkeley Rep. Joe Daning, “and, you know, before anything was absolutely done, any exemptions went away, people would have the opportunity to justify it.” “But the elimination of sales tax exemptions would make it worse than what I’m prepared to sit here and imagine," said Lewis Gossett of the SC Manufacturers’ Alliance. The Tax Policy Review Committee will take those comments and decide next on legislation to change the tax codes. Copyright 2016 WIS.

MONEY Survey Shows Most Americans Believe Big Banks Will Disappear (and They'll Be Happy to See Them Go) Here are 5 good ways to avoid using big banks. By Minda Zetlin Minda Zetlin is a business technology writer and speaker, co-author of The Geek Gap, and former president of the American Society of Journalists and Authors. Sign up here for a once-a-week email and you'll never miss her columns. @MindaZetlin Co-author, 'The Geek Gap'@MindaZetlin WRITE A COMMENT CREDIT: Getty Images Advertisement Do you see big banks as dinosaurs that are failing to keep up with changing times and certain to become extinct? If you're like most Americans, the answer is yes. In a survey of more than 2,000 Americans released today by early stage venture firm Blumberg Capital, 57 percent of respondents believed traditional banks as we know them today will cease to exist within our lifetimes. If this prediction turns out to be right, most of us won't be a bit sorry. A whopping 80 percent of respondents say big banks are too focused on serving the 1 percent and big businesses at the expense of small businesses and average consumers. More than 60 percent of respondents said banks are charging them too much interest on their debt, and 76 percent believe banks don't properly serve those with low credit scores or bad employment histories. They also think traditional banks are failing at supporting entrepreneurs. Fifty-nine percent said they would rather either borrow money from or lend money to a family member or friend to grow a small business--instead of paying, or have their friends pay, high interest to a bank. It's pretty clear, we Americans don't much like our big banks. And, it turns out, we don't have to bother with them if we don't want to. If you'd like to say bye-bye to your own too-big-to-fail financial behemoth, here are some attractive alternatives: 1. Credit unions. In the last few decades, credit unions have really come into their own as full-fledged financial institutions that provide most or all of the same services big banks do. They differ from banks in some important ways: First, they are not-for-profit organizations intended to benefit their members rather than rake in the cash. That means they usually offer lower fees or no fees for account, lower overdraft fees, better interest rates on credit cards, and better savings account rates than traditional banks. Credit unions are governed democratically by their members, and they all have membership requirements. But for some, those requirements make it very easy to join. For instance, I bank at BECU, the Boeing Employees Credit Union, which anyone who is a Washington resident can join. 2. Community banks. Another great alternative to big banks is small, community-based banks, such as local savings bank. Before moving to Snohomish, Washington from Woodstock, New York, I did most of my banking at Ulster Savings Bank in Ulster County, and paid my mortgage to Rondout Savings Bank, named for the Rondout Creek and historic neighborhood of Kingston, New York. Both banks offer most of the services you'd expect from a large bank, with good service and lower fees. 3. Internet-only financial institutions. Blumberg has an interest in funding fin-tech companies, which of course is why it commissioned the survey. But internet-based no-branch banks are a great way to get away from traditional bank fees. My husband is a veteran, so we get our car and home insurance through USAA, for instance. Although you can't, say, drop in and pick up a cashier's check if you're making a large cash purchase, you can do most things you could do with a bricks-and-mortar bank. The bank saves a lot on overhead by not having physical branches, and those savings are often passed along in the form of higher interest rates on savings, lower interest rates on credit, and lower or no fees. Here's a list of the top ten online banks to get you started. 4. Online brokers. Tony Robbins basically wrote a whole book to tell you that you don't need a big fancy brokerage firm or traditional bank for your investments. Instead, consider low-cost online brokers which provide you with research and let you pick your own stocks, buying and selling at will. Or if you want to follow Warren Buffett's get-rich-slow advice and invest in exchange-traded index funds, you can do that as well. 5. Alternative investments and credit. These days, there are all sorts of ways to circumnavigate big banks when it comes to investing, borrowing, and other traditional banking functions. PayPal and other online financial institutions provide good alternatives to a traditional checking account where you can make deposits and payments. (You need an underlying bank account to make deposits to PayPal, but it can be a savings account.) As for investing, here are several alternatives to big banks and brokerage houses that you can use even if you have less than $500 to invest. If you're a borrower, consider online lending clubs or crowdfunding, especially to start a business. Or do what most of the survey respondents said they preferred and borrow from friends or family instead. Like this column? Sign up to subscribe to email alerts and you'll never miss a post.

And while his long avoidance of federal income taxes is extreme, it's also part of a larger problem. The most affluent and powerful parts of our society have too easy a time legally avoiding taxes. David Leonhardt David Leonhardt Photo by Contributed Photo /Times Free Press. Consider corporate taxes, which ultimately tend to be paid by the well-off, because they own the most stock. The official corporate rate is 35 percent, infamously higher than in any other advanced economy. Yet there are so many loopholes that companies often pay relatively little in tax. Many companies work hard to shroud how much they really pay, sprinkling various figures throughout their complex financial statements. But companies must report one number that provides a good glimpse. It's called cash taxes paid — the combined amount that a company pays in federal, state, local and even foreign taxes. I asked the analysts at S&P Global Market Intelligence to calculate this number since 2007 for this country's 500 largest public companies, and the results reveal a broken tax system. Fixing it should be an early priority for the next president. A good case study is Amazon, which pays a rate much lower than its more traditional retail competitors. Between 2007 and last year, the company paid only 13 percent of its profits in taxes. Remember: That's not just federal taxes. It's federal, state, local and foreign taxes. How does Amazon get away with this? A tangle of tax breaks and loopholes, some enacted in the name of creating jobs despite meager evidence that they do. For many companies, the key move is opening offices in a low-tax country like Ireland and then claiming that much of their business flows through those offices. Put all these tax breaks together, and you end up with our system. AT&T and General Electric each paid a combined tax rate of only 18 percent since 2007, according to the S&P data. Coca-Cola, Apple and IBM paid 17 percent, and Alphabet (Google's parent) is at 16 percent. Boeing is at 8 percent, Facebook at 4 percent. "The tax code, on the business side and the personal side, is a rotting economic carcass," Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., told me. The billions of dollars in taxes being avoided by GE, Coca-Cola and others is money that can't be used to lift living standards for ordinary families: It can't be used to reduce their taxes and can't pay for schools, medical research or clean energy. There is another victim, too — one easily forgotten in this populist time. Many large companies do indeed pay a lot of taxes. For one reason or another, these companies can't take advantage of loopholes and must pay a rate much closer to the official one. Brick-and-mortar retailers, for example, aren't as politically popular as manufacturers or technology companies and haven't persuaded Congress to create a lot of special tax breaks. Retailers also can't easily pretend their business is based overseas. As a result, CVS, Home Depot, Wal-Mart and Target have all been paying a combined tax rate of more than 30 percent, more than twice as high as Amazon's rate. This system is cumbersome — causing companies to devote great effort to tax avoidance — and unfair. A better system could lift economic growth, by directing more of investors' money to truly promising companies, rather than tax-advantaged ones. As strong as the case for change is, corporate-tax reform will still cause a nasty political fight. Companies make millions of dollars from tax avoidance. To defend the status quo, some will devise clever arguments to suggest that a new system would somehow destroy jobs or otherwise wreak havoc. They will pretend they're just looking out for the rest of us. Don't be fooled.

Photo: Ramesh Pathania/Mint New Delhi: The Export-Import Bank of the US is looking to provide loans to India for procuring American equipment and technology for its booming airport sector that has investments worth at least $5 billion lined up for the next four years. Export-Import Bank chairman Fred Hochberg said he had held talks with civil aviation minister Ashok Gajapathi Raju to expand India-US cooperation in the sector. “Airport screening, security screening, baggage screening, air traffic control—those are the kind of areas America has grown its expertise in and which we can finance,” Hochberg said in an interview earlier this month on the sidelines of World Economic Forum’s Indian Economic Summit. “Obviously security issues are paramount, so an effective and less expensive way of security screening is important,” he added. Hochberb’s statements indicate that technology such as advanced airport scanners could be on the cards for airport security soon. The aviation ministry has faced problems over buying technology for Indian airports in recent years. The ministry has not specified the nature of the problems. A second airport for Goa, cleared in August, is being built by GMR Airports Pvt. Ltd, which also operates the Delhi and Hyderabad airports. Bidding for a second airport for Mumbai in Navi Mumbai is nearing completion. The state-owned Airports Authority of India has said it plans to spend nearly $3 billion to expand airport infrastructure across the country. India aims to build 50 new airports in the next three years as part of a plan to boost regional connectivity. Of these, at least 10 will become operational over the next year, Raju has said. The finance ministry, which has so far given grants mostly for the North-Eastern airports, has announced that it will also give grants to fund such low cost airports. Besides this, some airports that have recently been modernized are lining up for further expansion, including the ones in Delhi, Hyderabad and Bengaluru. The hectic modernization activity comes on the back of double-digit growth in India’s domestic air traffic that is expected to reach 100 million passengers by 2017, up from 80 million in 2015. Globally, India recorded the fastest domestic air passenger growth of 18.8% in 2015, according to the International Air Transport Association. International traffic to and from India has also been growing rapidly and has touched double digits. Hochberg said India used to be EXIM Bank’s biggest customer but that position has now been taken by US neighbour Mexico. “Mexico is our largest portfolio. India’s was second, now it’s in the top five,” he said. “Just the last year or two (Exim has slowed down in India). We were very active in aircraft petrochemicals and power for a number of projects. Lot of renewables. (Then) there was a slight hiatus and now it’s been reactivated and the Prime Minister is... (keen on more growth). I expect to see more activity as a result of that,” he said. Hochberg said an old case where a lawsuit alleged that EXIM had failed to consider the economic impact of its loan guarantees for the purchase of wide-bodied Boeing aircraft by Air India has ended. “The court found in our favour in every single case,” he said. Hochberg said he did not agree with the view that Airbus was able to manage more aircraft deals than Boeing in India. “There is some (truth to the argument)” that Airbus has cornered new airlines such as Vistara, AirAsia India as also IndiGo and GoAir. “But if you think about Jet Airways, SpiceJet and Air India -- a mixed fleet -- then it’s a more nuanced picture than that,” he said. Many Indian airlines have been in the red for several years and continue to be loaded with debt. Hochberg said while there was no written rule that an airline had to be profitable to get EXIM loans, there was a mechanism in place. “We would back US goods but we need to get it paid back. We look at the overall business proposition of the airline because we make loans, we don’t make grants. That’s our criteria. We look at the repayment ability,” he said. Air India (which gets sovereign guarantees) and Jet Airways have done business with the bank. SpiceJet is yet to begin, he said. “I know they are actively working with Jet, Air India and so forth. I understand there is a campaign there but I don’t have any more details on that,” he added. SpiceJet reiterated earlier this month that it was looking to order dozens of planes in the coming months. Boeing has said, without specifying timelines, that it expects Jet Airways to order more planes.

Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation provision, non-recurring items, gains (losses) on sale of assets, if any. These are non-GAAP financial measures, as defined herein, and should be read in conjunction with GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures are not presented as an alternative to GAAP cash flows from operations, as a measure of our liquidity or as an alternative to reported net income as an indicator of our operating performance. The non-GAAP financial measures as used herein may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. We believe the use of Adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP cash flow from operations along with GAAP financial measures enhances the understanding of our operating results and may be useful to investors in comparing our operating performance with that of other companies and estimating our enterprise value.  Adjusted EBITDA is also a useful tool in evaluating the operating results of the Company given the significant variation that can result from, for example, the timing of capital expenditures and the amount of working capital in support of our programs and contracts. We also use Adjusted EBITDA internally to evaluate the operating performance of the Company, to allocate resources and capital, and to evaluate future growth opportunities.

Peter Bellew, the carrier’s chief executive officer, met with Airbus’s senior management in Toulouse, France, on Wednesday to hammer out details of the plan, he said in an interview, adding that the meetings were “very positive.” Establishing a religious-charter operation is attractive because it would offer guaranteed revenues and predictable fares, passenger numbers and plane requirements, according to the CEO, who also looked at selling the A380s to Chinese airlines. The week-long Hajj and year-round Umrah pilgrimage could employ 20 superjumbos within five years and Bellew said the business might also tap further aircraft coming off lease or unwanted by other carriers. Airbus has been seeking to broaden the A380’s appeal as orders from new operators dry up, and is keen to establish the jet’s credentials as a mass-market workhorse rather than a just a fleet flagship. Bellew said the Hajj unit would be established as a standalone business potentially open to investment from manufacturers, while declining to say if Airbus planned to take a stake. “This is a huge, huge global movement of people,” Bellew said. “We’ve done a lot of homework and the figures are adding up.” The operation could be given a name and formally launched before the end of the year, he said. A350 Switch While carriers including Saudi Arabian Airlines, which leases-in dozens of jets to cater to the 2 million people who journey to Islam’s holiest city during the Hajj each year, and PT Garuda Indonesia, the biggest airline in the world’s largest Muslim country, have said they could use the A380 for pilgrimage flights, their plans have yet to come to fruition. Shukor Yusof, founder of aviation consultancy firm Endau Analytics in Malaysia, said it may be that the companies decided the A380 wasn’t the right plane for the Hajj, adding that Bellew’s decision not to sell his six planes suggests there is “no secondary market.” Malaysia Air, which has a full-flight simulator for the A380 and a hangar able to accommodate three of the planes at a time, no longer needs the double-decker as it switches to smaller Airbus A350 wide-bodies and focuses more on Asian markets. Planes used for the Hajj would be modified from their current 494-seat layout with Malaysia Air to accommodate 700 people in a single class, giving them the densest configuration of any superjumbo. Indian Ocean carrier Air Austral last year scrapped its order for two planes it had planned to fit with 840 seats apiece and most operators stick to about 500, though Dubai-based Emirates, the biggest customer, has begun flights with a 615-berth version. At least some of the Malaysian planes would be equipped to allow conversion when required to a lower 604-seat setup featuring business berths and better suited to the Umrah, which is not compulsory for Muslims and generally a more relaxed trip for participants, Bellew said, adding that the switch between seating patterns would take no more than a week. Aircraft would also feature prayer rooms and other special features necessary for pilgrimage flights. Airbus said that the A380’s performance, capability and space makes it “a versatile aircraft,” while declining to comment on the Malaysian plans. Wet-Lease Terms The aircraft would operate for other carriers or national governments on a so-called wet-lease basis, with pilots, cabin crew and associated services provided, the executive said. Potential markets range from Malaysia itself, where 60 percent of the population is Muslim, through Indonesia, China, Bangladesh, India, Arab north Africa and even the U.K., he said. The deployment of newer models on pilgrimage flights is likely to become mandatory as Saudi Arabia moves toward banning aircraft that are more than 20 years old for both Hajj and Umrah services, the executive said. Malaysia Air recently carried out heavy maintenance checks on its four-year-old A380s and found them to be in near-perfect condition, Bellew said, speculating that the model could have a lifespan of 50 years, “like the Boeing 707.” Outside of the religious-charter market, the A380s could substitute for other large wide-bodies, such as other superjumbos and Boeing Co. 777s and 747s, when they are undergoing maintenance checks that can take three or four months, he said. The business would most likely be established as a separate entity under Malaysian ownership and with a local air operator’s certificate, the CEO said. Manufacturers have expressed an interest in participating in the new entity on an equity or risk-sharing basis, while other governments could even take an ownership, he said.

One thing Trump and Hillary agree on: More defense Posted on October 20, 2016October 20, 2016 by GS Early Views: 843 86 Shares This is quite an election season. Rarely do two candidates engender so much anger and disgust. But there is one thing that actually unites them: a rebirth in defense spending. In 2013, the U.S. Congress decided the U.S. government needed to slim down, so it enacted the sequester, which essentially meant budgets were slashed across the board. Since defense is the largest item on the U.S. budget, it got hit hardest. That meant no spending on new weapons systems, no significant upgrades of technology or logistics. Whether this is good or bad may be debatable, but the consequences are what we hear in both campaigns: The U.S. needs to rebuild its power and influence in the world again through its military might. Again, I am not here to express my opinion on the wisdom (or stupidity) of this plan but to tell you how you can profit from it, if you choose to do so. Beyond the politics, there is a real fundamental demand that will show we are at the ground floor of a major defense spending mega-trend. Some of it comes out of simple necessity. We beat up, blew up and fired a lot of the aging equipment we had in the arsenal in our efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan. Iraq alone has lasted longer than any conflict the U.S. has been involved in… ever. You go through a lot of equipment regardless of the intensity of the conflict. You always have to be prepared. That means the U.S. is about to go on a massive spending plan to restock our military arsenal. And much of the equipment will be brand spanking new, not just re-orders. All the armed forces are looking to upgrade their systems and retire some equipment that has been around since the Cold War. It’s also about transitioning from a people-heavy force to an increasingly automated force — unmanned vehicles, cybersecurity, telecommunications. And it has already begun. For example, the Air Force has purchased the next generation long-range bomber the B-21 Raider which will not only replace the B-2, but also the B-52s that have been around since the Korean War. Each plane is expected to cost $500 million and the first build is about 100 planes. The second leg will double or triple that number. The Navy is transitioning its projection of power by moving to Littoral Combat Ships (LCS) using unmanned boats to search for mines and unmanned helicopters to stay aware of what’s happening in the theater of operations. There is a massive multiplier effect in all this, across each branch of the services. And both presidential front runners are more than willing to move this along. If you want to take advantage of this mega-trend — because you’re not going to stop it from happening — is to look to the two major defense stocks, Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman. Boeing will also likely benefit, but it is no longer the company it once was. Its commercial airline division and corporate welfare projects by the U.S. government have kept it alive over the years, but it’s more diversified than Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman. Another good smaller play that will benefit mightily from the increased intelligence and cybersecurity business is a small firm called Mantech. It’s a leveraged play on a particular sector but could mean big profits in coming years. — GS Early This entry was posted in Featured. Bookmark the permalink.

Use this handy guide to increase your chances of a profitable investment in airline stocks. Asit Sharma (TMFfinosus) Oct 19, 2016 at 7:00PM Image source: Getty Images. Buying airline stocks can be one of the more vexing exercises a stock investor undertakes. Commercial aviation is a complicated industry that rewards investors who use a structured plan when researching portfolio candidates. In this two-part series, we break down a checklist that covers a number of key areas to consider before clicking "buy" on a carrier's symbol in your brokerage account. The full checklist follows; let's begin by diving into the first five areas. Image source: author.  1. Put operating income margin in context This may come as a surprise, but despite drastically different economic models and operating characteristics between low-cost carriers (LCCs), ultra-low-cost carriers (ULCCs), and network carriers, most airlines tend to have very similar profit profiles.  Why would this be the case? It's simple: The basic economics of running an airline haven't changed in years. For most airlines you'll analyze, labor expense and fuel expense together will equal between 45% and 55% of a carrier's total operating cost. During periods of higher fuel prices and wage inflation, these combined costs can take up an even bigger slice of the total expense pie. Because of these two outsize line items, and because the amount airlines can charge for each seat is governed by competition, there's not a huge amount of operating leverage available to any given airline to improve profitability very much beyond its peers. I've collected recent trailing-12-month operating margins for a wide variety of carriers. When we remove two outliers, Allegiant Travel and United Continental Holdings, we can see that operating income falls in a pretty tight range, from 15% to just over 24%. Data source: YCharts. If you buy into an airline with operating income much below the 10-percentage-point spread in which most airline profits tend to cluster, be sure to understand why the margin is depressed, and ascertain if a plan exists to bring the airline closer to benchmark level. And if you acquire stock in an airline which exceeds the top of the operating margin band above, check on its valuation relative to peers, to make sure you're not paying too dearly for the profit. We'll return to valuation in Part 2. 2. Gauge existing leverage The extent to which an airline is a capital-intensive business is hard to appreciate, unless perhaps you run a rail company. Ample debt is the norm in this industry. In periods of high inflation and low economic growth, many airlines have historically been caught in a cycle of declining passenger miles sold alongside higher financing costs, leading to the serial bankruptcies for which the industry is famous. The past few years of economic recovery and sustained low interest rates have provided airlines with opportunities to clean up their balance sheets. Three U.S. carriers -- Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV), Alaska Airlines, and Delta Airlines (NYSE:DAL) -- have even reduced debt enough over the past few years to enjoy "investment grade" status, the highest debt rating granted by major credit rating agencies. Still, seeing substantial borrowings on an airline's balance sheet isn't necessarily bad. Airlines need efficient fleets to serve capacity. But how much is too much debt? Running a standard debt-to-equity ratio might not be very helpful in answering this question. Rather, compare net property and equipment (i.e., a carrier's planes and other fixed assets) to long-term debt. In most cases, net property and equipment should exceed long-term borrowings. If you're looking at a network (also loosely referred to as "legacy") carrier such as American Airlines, I'd also recommend adding pension liabilities to long-term debt in this comparison.  Couple this with a ratio such as "times interest earned" to get a sense of how current cash flow covers debt obligations. This may seem like a lot of work, but it's your best way to protect your investment dollars in an industry that tends to move in boom and bust cycles. 3. Scan the major statistics Aviation is a statistics-driven industry. You should be familiar with the major statistics airlines use to describe their operations, but beware -- it's easy to get into the weeds and focus too heavily on these. Keep them in context of your existing knowledge of a carrier. Nearly every airline publishes its major statistics, which you can find in quarterly and annual reports, as well as news articles that cover airline earnings. Two important metrics that serve as excellent signposts to a carrier's recent health are PRASM, or passenger revenue per available seat mile, and CASM, or operating cost per available seat mile. Both of these figures are expressed in cents. Most airlines also provide a CASM "ex-fuel" statistic, which shows operating costs without the effect of fuel pricing. Checking in on major statistics allows you to see an airline's performance expressed in all-important parameters like passengers and miles. Once you get comfortable reviewing these numbers, it's helpful to compare the stats of your investment with similarly configured airlines. 4. Find the average fleet age  Understanding fleet age and fleet plans is crucial to grasping a carrier's long-term business strategy. You can quickly find fleet age on sites such as planespotters.net, along with detailed descriptions of the types of planes that make up an airline's fleet. Delta's average fleet age, for example, is one of the oldest among both network carriers and LCC/ULCC airlines, at nearly 17 years. Compare this with Southwest Airlines, which has a calculated fleet age of roughly 12 years.  Delta's time-honored strategy has been to focus on repair and maintenance over buying new planes, thus pushing up long-term debt. Recently, however, the airline has turned its attention to fleet modernization.Committed Delta investors should check fleet age every few quarters, looking for an aggregate reduction in line with management's current plans. You can see that the general idea is pretty simple: Find the fleet age and grasp what it tells you about a particular carrier's asset strategy, and then monitor changes on a regular basis. 5. Familiarize yourself with route strategy Like fleet age, an airline's changing routes point to its larger ambitions. While network carriers' routes cover the globe and take time for the average investor to absorb, it can be relatively easy to understand how route additions and deletions affect regional airlines and LCCs. For example, Hawaiian Holdings (NASDAQ:HA) subsidiary Hawaiian Airlines is currently waiting for fulfillment on an order for six Boeing A320 neo units, which will allow it future route expansion opportunities. Mark Dunkerley, the airline's CEO, recently acknowledged that routes to Europe, and specifically London, are a possibility in the near future. To the investor who pays attention, this type of route enhancement signals revenue opportunity ahead.  Rounding out the checklist Are the skies looking friendlier yet?
