Hollywood star John Travolta has donated his 707 to an Australian aviation museum. Photo: AFP mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 11:15 AM, May 30, 2017 SYDNEY — Hollywood star John Travolta has donated his Boeing 707 plane to an Australian aviation museum and is aiming to be part of the crew to deliver the vintage aircraft. Made for Qantas Airways in 1964, the Hollywood actor, who is a qualified pilot, acquired the jet when Australia’s national carrier retired it more than 30 years later. “It gives me great pleasure to make this exciting historical announcement that my beloved Boeing 707 aircraft has been donated to the Historical Aircraft Restoration society (HARS),” Travolta, a Qantas ambassador since 2002, said in a statement. Australian aircraft preservation organisation HARS will help restore the plane so it can make the journey from the United States to their base some 145km from Sydney. A date for the flight is not yet fixed but the actor, a long-time aviation buff, said he plans to be on it. “The aircraft currently requires a lot of work to be restored to a safe flying state and having seen first hand the dedication and passion of people at HARS, I have no doubt this beautiful and historical aircraft will be flying again,” Travolta said. “I am hoping to be part of the crew to fly the aircraft to Australia.” HARS President Bob De La Hunty said the idea was first floated when he met Travolta in 2009 and the pair flew a Qantas 1955 Super Constellation aircraft along Australia’s east coast. “We share a mutual respect for old airplanes and flying and at that stage we were keen to suggest to him that if he ever wanted to part with his Boeing 707 we would be very interested in it,” De La Hunty told broadcaster ABC. “When we heard earlier this year that he was looking at possibly not continuing with his Boeing 707, we made contact. He jumped at the idea and so we’ve been in detailed discussions and negotiations since.” Boeing 707s dominated passenger aircraft in the 1960s, helping usher in an era of long-range travel which had previously been dominated by rail and sea.

The rivals are two high-end business jets. The contract may lead to further lucrative work. Share story By Dominic Gates Seattle Times aerospace reporter For a vital aircraft that will fly above distant battlefields, the Air Force will choose between Goliath and two Davids. One is a jet originally designed to carry around 135 passengers, the two others built to carry fewer than 20 people. With a $6.9 billion deal on the line, a militarized version of Boeing’s Renton-built 737 jet is going up against the Gulfstream G550 and the Bombardier Global 6000 high-end business jets for a special-mission contract to be awarded as early as this fall. The 17 JSTARS jets at issue will be stuffed with high-tech military radar and computer-analysis equipment.

Get 90% off digital access. The planes are heavily used in combat zones for surveillance of ground forces and to target enemy positions. The current JSTARS fleet is now active in strikes on the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria. Boeing hopes a JSTARS win could incline the Air Force to choose the 737 to replace more than 100 different types of special-mission aircraft in its inventory — contracts that are lucrative far beyond the mere number of 737s involved. But the competition from Savannah, Georgia-based Gulfstream and Canada’s Bombardier is formidable. For special missions, air forces around the world are increasingly selecting business jets that fly higher, faster and further than airliners. The U.S. Air Force initially chose the Gulfstream for a separate electronic-jamming plane code-named Compass Call, although Boeing this month formally challenged that process. Fred Smith, director of global sales and marketing at Boeing Military Aircraft, dismisses the business jets as “a great solution for countries with smaller air forces and navies.” As for the U.S., he said, “for a bigger mission, you need a bigger airplane.” JSTARS 737 virtual tour In a conference room inside Boeing’s former Space Center in Kent, now a hive of different defense programs, a reporter donned a virtual-reality visor to take a look at a virtual mock-up of the jet maker’s 737 JSTARS contender. JSTARS stands for Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System. It’s a joint Air Force and Army system, revolving around a massive, long-range radar that monitors what’s happening on the ground in a battle zone. The virtual mock-up shows the radar hidden in a canoe-shaped bump about 20 feet long under the jet’s fuselage. Inside the virtual airplane, operators seated at 10 stations toward the rear of the aircraft monitored large computer screens, analyzing the radar data and communicating with U.S. forces. Aft of the stations, large metal cabinets housed the computer servers and other equipment. Forward of them was a robust printer and a “mission table,” with a tabletop computer display screen of the battle zone. At the front of the cabin, immediately behind the flight deck, was a crew rest area for long-endurance missions and extra seats. Then Smith showed off a Boeing marketing trick, designed to impress upon the Air Force why size matters. With a click of a button, an arc of light sliced through the virtual cabin, superimposing upon Boeing’s mock-up another cabin wall that cut off half the computer stations. “That’s the G550 fuselage,” Smith said. Highflying G550 The Gulfstream jet is proposed by a team led by defense firm Northrop Grumman and L3 Technologies, a leading integrator of military electronics. L3 is the lead system integrator role on the Compass Call contract and is set to choose the aircraft for that program — Boeing’s protest of the contracting process centers on L3’s close collaboration with Gulfstream. L3 integrated the intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance mission systems on G550s sold to Australia, Israel and Singapore and for other special-mission models sold to Japan and Germany. Northrop is the prime contractor on the current JSTARS fleet. First deployed in combat during the first Iraq war in 1991, those jets are all converted 707 airliners — now with an average age of 48 years and ripe for replacement with something more efficient. Alan Metzger, Northrop’s vice president for surveillance and targeting systems, said in an interview that though the Air Force needed a 707-sized jet to house all the equipment when the original JSTARS contract was awarded in 1985, a smaller business jet is appropriate today because the technology has all been miniaturized. “I don’t understand why you need a 135-passenger aircraft to carry around 10 Air Force operators,” Metzger said. Northrop bought a G550 and outfitted it with the current JSTARS mission equipment to demonstrate not only that the jet was big enough and met all requirements but that it had sufficient margin for any anticipated future growth. The key advantage of the business-jet solution is performance, he said. The G550 will fly hundreds of miles farther than a 737 and burn less fuel. It’s so much lighter it can take off from a shorter runway, giving it access to almost twice as many bases around the world, Metzger said. And the G550’s standard flight ceiling is 51,000 feet, compared with 41,000 feet for the 737. That matters when you are beaming radar down into a mountainous region such as, say, Afghanistan. At lower altitudes, a mountain peak up ahead may be in the way. As the plane flies higher, it has a direct line of sight into more of the landscape below. “You’ll see less if you have to look through rock, instead of over it,” Metzger said. Global 6000 foreign sales The third JSTARS contender, offering the Bombardier business jet as the platform, is a team led by defense giant Lockheed Martin, partnered with electronics and mission-systems integrator Raytheon. Raytheon is separately bidding against Northrop to provide the high-tech radar equipment on the JSTARS plane and all three contenders are ready to offer whichever radar system wins. The Bombardier Global 6000 is larger than the G550, both longer and with a wider cabin, yet still about half the weight of the smallest 737. The U.S. Air Force uses a Global 6000 for its E-11 special-mission jet, which is an airborne node for relaying battlefield communications. And the Bombardier jet too has won a series of foreign military orders, said Stephane Villeneuve, Bombardier’s vice president of specialized aircraft. It’s the platform for the U.K.’s Sentinel reconnaissance fleet, AWACS aircraft for the United Arab Emirates, intelligence-gathering aircraft for India and maritime-patrol aircraft for Israel. “In the international market, people are going to a business jet for all the missions we are describing here,” Villeneuve said. 737 cost effectiveness That trend threatens Boeing’s hope of extending its line of modified commercial jets for the military by replacing all the U.S. Air Force special-mission aircraft with 737-based models. Most of the existing planes are aging 707-based platforms, with a variety of missions and each with its own strangely opaque code name, including: • Cobra Ball, a fleet of three aircraft that collect data on ballistic-missile launches. • Rivet Joint, a 17-strong fleet of aircraft that gather and analyze military-electronic signals. • Constant Phoenix, a two-aircraft fleet that collects atmospheric data from nuclear tests. The Gulfstream and Bombardier jets each cost just over $60 million at list prices, some $20 million cheaper than the Boeing 737 model on offer. And they do burn a lot less fuel than the big jet. Nevertheless, one of Boeing’s major arguments is that the Air Force will save money on a fleet of 737s because maintenance and operational costs are so much lower. There are more than 9,000 of its 737s in service around the world, Boeing argues, with spare parts available anywhere in the world within 24 hours and with a tremendous reliability record that minimizes downtime. Smith compares the Air Force’s options to someone looking to repair a Ford truck rather than a fancy sports car. “There’s a maintenance shop on every corner,” he said. “It’s extremely cost competitive.” He cited U.S. Defense Department data showing that when maintenance costs are included, the total operational cost of a 737 used to ferry around top military brass is about half that of a G550-based Air Force jet used for the same purpose. Rod Meranda, Boeing’s sales and marketing lead for the JSTARS program, contends that the Air Force also takes on less risk if it goes with Boeing. For example, he said, neither the G550 nor the Global 6000 has ever been fitted with an in-flight refueling capability — a JSTARS requirement. “There’s a lot of risk taking a small airplane, cutting a hole in it and putting in in-flight refueling,” said Meranda. “How much will it take to test that, something that’s never been done before?” Boeing by contrast has already installed in-flight refueling on its 737-based fleet of P-8 Poseidon anti-submarine jets. The Air Force plans to weigh the cost, risk and performance of the three proposals on offer and choose the JSTARS replacement by year end. If Boeing were to win, the necessary military modifications to the airframe would likely be done during final assembly on the Renton production line — perhaps even on the same dedicated military line now churning out the P-8s. Where Boeing would then install the mission equipment, the radar and all the computers, is unclear. Still, for Renton, a Boeing JSTARS win would be significant and worth more than just 17 airplanes. It would indicate a high likelihood of further special-mission aircraft contracts later. First though, Goliath has to beat the Davids.

(Credit: CNN) Russia’s first large airliner since the fall of the Soviet Union made its maiden flight Sunday. The Irkut MC-21 is designed to compete with the most popular airliners in the world, the single-aisle Boeing 737 and Airbus A320. The prototype took flight Sunday morning from the Irkutsk Aviation Plant airfield in Siberia, about 2,600 miles east of Moscow. During the 30-minute flight, the plane reached an altitude of 1,000 meters (roughly 3,300 feet). Oleg Kononenko, the flight’s lead test pilot, reported that the aircraft operated normally. The MC-21’s maiden flight was notably shorter than that of its Chinese competitor and other similar aircraft, which have typically flown for an hour or longer and at a higher altitude. The flight comes ahead of the Paris Air Show, which starts June 18. Irkut hasn’t yet said whether the jet will be ready in time to make its international debut at the event. The Russian aircraft’s debut is the latest in a series of aviation firsts in 2017. The unusually busy year has featured a parade of maiden flights by new models from airplane makers around the world. China’s new challenge to Boeing and Airbus, the Comac C919, made its first flight on May 5. But while Russia is pushing the MC-21 with airlines around the world as a way to increase its non-military aerospace exports, Comac has shown less interest in selling the C919 overseas. Russia’s commercial aerospace industry has struggled over the past quarter century to regain the strength it had during the Soviet era. Through projects backed by President Vladimir Putin, it has sought to shed its reputation for advanced, but unreliable, passenger aircraft. The country last week formalized a partnership with China to made a long-range twin-aisle airliner to compete with Boeing and Airbus. The MC-21 is expected to start flying passengers in 2019 after it completes testing. Russian airline Aeroflot will be the first to fly the new jetliner. The state-run carrier has relied heavily on Airbus and Boeing jets as part of its modernization, but Russian policy has encouraged the introduction of homegrown models, like the MC-21. Irkut says the MC-21, which seats 163 passengers in two classes, will be 12% to 15% less expensive to operate than its Western counterparts. The manufacturer has taken 175 orders for the jet, which has a range of about 3,500 nautical miles or 6,400 kilometers. Irkut is an arm of the Russian state-owned aerospace conglomerate United Aircraft Corporation, which supplies the country’s airborne military hardware. Like the Chinese C919, the MC-21 has used many Western aerospace suppliers. The jet took the sky on Sunday powered by two U.S.-made Pratt & Whitney geared turbofan engines, which are also used by Airbus, Canada’s Bombardier and Brazil’s Embraer. Russia is developing a new engine of its own for the MC-21. While the Russian aerospace industry has lagged U.S. and European companies, Airbus and Boeing are closely watching the new jet’s progress. The MC-21 is packed with advanced carbon fiber technology and flight controls that haven’t yet made their way to Boeing and Airbus aircraft. 61.524010 105.318756 Filed in: Nation/World Topics: Irkut MC-21, russia, soviet union Suggest a correction × Suggest A Correction Your name Your email Report a typo or grammatical error Cancel Share this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn Pinterest Email KTLA 5 News on Instagram Popular Bay Area Water Park Closes Slides After Boy Spins Off Chute Onto Concrete on Opening Day Off-Duty Customs Officer Shoots 2 Teens, 1 Fatally, in Alleged Attempted Robbery Attack in Arcadia 210,000 Pounds of Hot Dogs Recalled Nationwide After Complaints of Metal Contamination Evidence Seized at Grandmother’s Home Amid Search for Missing 5-Year-Old San Gabriel Valley Boy: LASD Latest News Man Shot During Apparent Fight in Apple Valley Target Parking Lot DeLorean Driver Gets Speeding Ticket for Driving 88 Mph, Exact Speed in ‘Back to the Future’ Man Killed, Other Injured in South L.A. Shooting Former Panamanian Dictator Manuel Noriega Dies at 83 Nation/World U.S. Imposes Electronics Ban on Flights From Major Middle Eastern, African Airports Nation/World Man Dragged Off United Flight Has Concussion, Will File Suit, Lawyer Says Nation/World 4 Times in 4 Days: Russian Military Aircraft, Including Nuclear-Capable Bombers, Spotted Off U.S. Coast Politics Officials Believe Terrorist Organizations Plant Explosives in Electronic Devices That Can Evade Airport Screenings Nation/World Passenger Brawl Breaks Out at Florida Airport After Spirit Airlines Cancels Flight Nation/World British Airways IT Outage Disrupts Flights Worldwide Nation/World Electronics Banned From Cabins on Some Middle Eastern, African Flights to U.S. Nation/World Passenger Was ‘Aggressive,’ Fought With Officers Before Being Dragged Off United Flight: Police Report News United Fallout: 2 More Officers Placed on Leave After Passenger’s Violent Removal Local News Nation/World American Airlines Passenger Detained After Disturbance on Flight Out of LAX Nation/World Putin Warns Against ‘Intimidating’ North Korea After Latest Missile Launch Local News Morning News News HUP-2 helicopter Nation/World North Korea Attempts Missile Launch; Test Fails, Officials Say Mobile Apps Android App iPhone & iPad App KTLA 5 News on Social Media Watch CW Shows Facebook Twitter Instagram Email Alerts About & Contact screenertv Screener Untitled-2Covers Online Public File • Terms of Service • Privacy Policy • 5800 Sunset Blvd. Los Angeles, CA, 90028 • Copyright © 2017, KTLA • A Tribune Broadcasting Station • Powered by WordPress.com VIP × Email Alerts Send to Email Address Your Name Your Email Address Cancel Post was not sent - check your email addresses!

Boeing 707s dominated passenger aircraft in the 1960s, helping usher in an era of long-range travel which had previously been dominated by rail and sea.

The company said Wednesday that it still plans to deliver the first Boeing 737 Max later this month, and production will continue. A Boeing 737 MAX 9 under construction at the company's production facility in Renton, Washington, on Feb. 13. Jason Redmond / Reuters file The news sent Boeing Co. shares down nearly 4 percent, although they recovered partly to close at $183.18, down $2.31, or 1.3 percent. Chicago-based Boeing was notified last week of a potential issue involving turbine engine discs produced by a supplier to engine maker CFM International. Boeing said it has not experienced any problems with the discs during more than 2,000 hours of testing. It poses no safety concerns for travelers because no airlines are yet flying the 737 Max but it could mean a costly disruption if the problem persists. Timely delivery is important to planemakers as they get most of the payment for a plane when it is handed to the buyer. The Max is designed to be a more fuel-efficient version of the workhorse 737, Boeing's most popular commercial plane. Malaysia's Malindo Air plans to take delivery of the first Max in a few days and begin using it for passenger flights before July. Dallas-based Southwest Airlines Co. expects to begin using the plane this fall. It said Boeing had not warned it of any delays to its delivery schedule. Related: China's 'Homegrown' Competitor to 737 Takes to the Skies American Airlines Group Inc., which has 100 737 MAX jets on order, declined to comment when contacted by Reuters. The discs in question are made by a supplier to CFM International, a joint venture of General Electric and France's Safran. GE spokeswoman Jamie Jewell declined to identify the supplier. She said GE and Safran will work with the supplier to find and correct any shortcomings in the manufacturing process while also turning to a backup supplier to keep production of engines on schedule.

Jason Redmond / AFP - Getty Images file In a written statement, Boeing said it will work with CFM "to understand the precise scope and root cause of the quality issue." New planes and parts go through extensive testing to turn up problems before passengers go on board. Cai von Rumohr, an analyst with Cowen and Co., said "this doesn't look like a serious concern" because Boeing still expects to deliver the first plane this month and it appears to be a fixable manufacturing problem rather than a design flaw. Boeing has built about 9,500 single-aisle 737s since the late 1960s. The company said it has taken more than 3,700 orders for the Max, which carries a list price of $112.4 million to $119.2 million, although airlines routinely get big discounts.

Quotes in the article Boeing Co BA ▼ 186.59 -0.48 -0.26% Hexcel Corp HXL ▼ 50.66 -0.50 -0.98% The MS-21, a new single aisle airliner produced by Russia's United Aircraft Corporation, is the first passenger plane borne aloft by lightweight carbon-composite wings built without a costly pressurized oven called an autoclave. The manufacturing process provides a test for a technology already being assessed by Western rivals, who are looking for cheaper and faster ways to build some of their aircraft with composites, according to aerospace executives and suppliers. Even as it sets up the world's largest autoclaves to make wings for its giant 777X, Boeing is exploring alternatives for its "New Midsize Airplane" (NMA), in the middle of the market between its big wide-body jets and best-selling 737. "There's a good chance part of the NMA will be built without autoclaves," a person familiar with the project said. A Boeing spokesman said it was studying mid-market opportunities and declined further comment. Sources say Boeing's choice of technology for its two-aircraft NMA family will lay the foundation for the next generation of its money-spinning 737, expected to appear from 2030 and last well into the second half of the century. Boeing has not yet discussed this part of its strategy publicly, but industry sources said it may include a trio of jets seating 160 to 210 people and built using broadly the same production system as the one developed for the NMA. Both families of planes are likely to be built for 30 years and stay in service for another 20-30. So today's technology choices represent a colossal 75-year bet. Airbus too is monitoring the technology as it considers how to respond to Boeing's mid-market jet, CNN reported last month. Airbus has declined to comment on the report. PIVOTAL DECISION Composites have been used in aviation since the 1970s but achieved a breakthrough in the past decade as the Boeing 787 Dreamliner and Airbus A350 entered service, promising to save money on fuel by replacing most metal parts with lighter carbon. Those are long-haul jets, which means that the savings on fuel are worthwhile even though the planes are expensive to build. For short-haul planes that burn less fuel, like the NMA or future 737, it is more important to find cheaper ways to build them, and avoiding the need for autoclaves could help. Betting on technology that does not require an autoclave is a gamble also for composite suppliers like U.S.-based Hexcel (HXL.N), Solvay (SOLB.BR) of Belgium and Toray (3402.T) of Japan, whose share of aerospace manufacturing is growing. At a recent JEC composites fair in Paris, Hexcel and Solvay showcased out-of-autoclave prototype parts as they gear up to supply manufacturers on a bigger scale. "It's one of the big questions now in aerospace: how to produce out-of-autoclave on a large scale and at high speeds," said Henri Girardy, business development manager at Hexcel Composites, adding jetmakers would accept no cut in performance. Boeing's Dreamliner and the Airbus A350 are built from carbon fiber already impregnated with resin, called "prepreg", which is supplied to jetmakers, tailored by machines into plane parts and cured inside giant pressure-cooking autoclaves.© REUTERS/Christian Hartmann Belgian chemicals group Solvay displays a prototype aircraft wing skin made using alternative resin-infusion production methods without a traditional autoclave at the JEC World exhibition at Villepinte Analysts say these parts cost around 30-40 percent more to produce than aluminum. Under the new technology, instead of using fiber that is pre-impregnated with resin, parts are made from a dry-fiber engineered textile which is placed in a mould and then infused with resin under a vacuum. The parts can then be cured in an oven without pressure, a process estimated to cost 25 percent more than metal. Ultimately, that gap needs to narrow significantly or disappear. Boatbuilders and windfarm makers have used this method for years. Secondary airplane parts have also been made that way. But although Canada's Bombardier partly used the technique for its CSeries, it was rare for flight-critical parts before the designers of the new Russian plane chose it for the wing. The MS-21 has yet to score large sales but has been able to catch onto the latest manufacturing wave at a time when Western giants are starting to think beyond their recently upgraded models to future designs. "This is an excellent technology demonstrator because it is on a real programme and a primary-structure part," said Frank Nickisch, global director of strategic projects at Solvay Composite Materials, which provided materials for the MS-21. He noted that the wings on the MS-21 are of comparable size to a Boeing 737 or Airbus A320.© REUTERS An MS-21 medium-range passenger plane, produced by Irkut Corporation, takes off in Irkutsk Still, more needs to be done to bring down costs. And composite firms are not yet ready to support output at speeds planemakers have in mind. Industry sources say Boeing is expected to build 20-30 of its proposed mid-market planes a month, about twice the rate for the 787. Future 737 and A320 replacements are likely to be closer to the 60-80 mark. Nickisch said the proposed new Boeing middle-market aircraft would be a good test case for whether the industry can switch to a higher tempo using the widely expected composites. Yet tough planemaker targets on cost, performance and output require progress on three fronts: cheaper materials, wider automation and computer simulation to ensure new technology works first time, following widespread delays with new jet programmes. "Prepreg technology has been developing for 40 years, based on day-to-day knowledge. But to bring in a new process we need to be able to predict it first, with databanks," Girardy said.

Boeing says a trade fight it has launched against Bombardier is meant to prevent the construction of a larger aircraft that would compete against its 737 aircraft. (Ryan Remiorz/Canadian Press) Related Stories In Bombardier fight, Boeing sees ghost of Airbus ascent Ottawa reconsiders Boeing purchases amid accusations against Bombardier Boeing seeks duties at hearing against Bombardier CSeries Cross-border aircraft rivals Bombardier, Boeing clash in trade hearing Bombardier faces lengthy legal battle with Boeing that could hurt CSeries sales Boeing says its trade complaint against Bombardier is designed to prevent the Montreal-based rival from using subsidies to build a larger version of the CSeries plane that would directly compete with its own flagship narrowbody 737 aircraft. Last week, Boeing filed a document with the U.S. International Trade Commission that sheds new light on the tit-for-tat dispute between the two aerospace manufacturers. In the 109-page filing, Boeing said Bombardier would be positioned to build a full-fleet of single-aisle planes — repeating a strategy employed by French aerospace company Airbus — if Canadian subsidies to Bombardier are left unaddressed. In Bombardier fight, Boeing sees ghost of Airbus ascent Ottawa reconsiders Boeing purchases amid accusations against Bombardier "The U.S. industry has been the victim of this exact strategy before, as subsidies to Airbus enabled it to push McDonnell Douglas and Lockheed from the market, and capture 50 per cent global market share, destroying countless high-paying, skilled U.S. jobs in the process," Boeing said. Bombardier said in a separate filing that Boeing's effort to shut down its innovative technology from the market is "misguided," adding that the complaint is tantamount to asking the U.S. International Trade Commission to imagine a hypothetical world in the future. The company said its CSeries commercial jet isn't an imminent threat to Boeing because the first planes won't be delivered to Delta for another year, Boeing doesn't sell a comparable product and Boeing's 737 production is sold out for about eight years with a backlog valued at about $190 billion US, Bombardier said. "Using this case as an Airbus 'do-over' is a misuse of the statutory threat provision," Bombardier said. Boeing seeks duties at hearing against Bombardier CSeries Cross-border aircraft rivals Bombardier, Boeing clash in trade hearing Bombardier also rejected Boeing's claim that it is suffering present material injury as a result of Delta Air Lines' CSeries order. "If Boeing were correct that Delta established momentum for Bombardier, and caused harm to Boeing, one would expect to see additional CSeries orders in the U.S. market, but not one has occurred in the 13 months since the Delta purchase of CS100s," Bombardier said. Boeing's 737 fleet is expected to generate $26 billion US in free cash flow over the next four years, but the Chicago-based firm said it would be wrong to assume that it is not vulnerable to the threat subsidies pose, as the history with Airbus shows. The dispute has become politically charged, with Ottawa recently announcing that it was reviewing current military procurement projects with Boeing — a thinly veiled threat to scrap the planned purchase of 18 Super Hornet fighter jets from the company. Boeing has petitioned the U.S. Commerce Department and the U.S. International Trade Commission to investigate subsidies for Bombardier's CSeries aircraft that it says have allowed the company to export planes at well below cost.

The MS-21, a new single aisle airliner produced by Russia’s United Aircraft Corporation, is the first passenger plane borne aloft by lightweight carbon-composite wings built without a costly pressurised oven called an autoclave. The manufacturing process provides a test for a technology already being assessed by Western rivals, who are looking for cheaper and faster ways to build some of their aircraft with composites, according to aerospace executives and suppliers. Even as it sets up the world’s largest autoclaves to make wings for its giant 777X, Boeing is exploring alternatives for its “New Midsize Airplane” (NMA), in the middle of the market between its big wide-body jets and best-selling 737. “There’s a good chance part of the NMA will be built without autoclaves,” a person familiar with the project said. A Boeing spokesman said it was studying mid-market opportunities and declined further comment. Sources say Boeing’s choice of technology for its two-aircraft NMA family will lay the foundation for the next generation of its money-spinning 737, expected to appear from 2030 and last well into the second half of the century. Boeing has not yet discussed this part of its strategy publicly, but industry sources said it may include a trio of jets seating 160 to 210 people and built using broadly the same production system as the one developed for the NMA. Both families of planes are likely to be built for 30 years and stay in service for another 20-30. So today’s technology choices represent a colossal 75-year bet. Airbus too is monitoring the technology as it considers how to respond to Boeing’s mid-market jet, CNN reported last month. Airbus has declined to comment on the report. PIVOTAL DECISION Composites have been used in aviation since the 1970s but achieved a breakthrough in the past decade as the Boeing 787 Dreamliner and Airbus A350 entered service, promising to save money on fuel by replacing most metal parts with lighter carbon. Those are long-haul jets, which means that the savings on fuel are worthwhile even though the planes are expensive to build. For short-haul planes that burn less fuel, like the NMA or future 737, it is more important to find cheaper ways to build them, and avoiding the need for autoclaves could help. Betting on technology that does not require an autoclave is a gamble also for composite suppliers like U.S.-based Hexcel <HXL.N>, Solvay <SOLB.BR> of Belgium and Toray <3402.T> of Japan, whose share of aerospace manufacturing is growing. At a recent JEC composites fair in Paris, Hexcel and Solvay showcased out-of-autoclave prototype parts as they gear up to supply manufacturers on a bigger scale. “It’s one of the big questions now in aerospace: how to produce out-of-autoclave on a large scale and at high speeds,” said Henri Girardy, business development manager at Hexcel Composites, adding jetmakers would accept no cut in performance. Boeing’s Dreamliner and the Airbus A350 are built from carbon fibre already impregnated with resin, called “prepreg”, which is supplied to jetmakers, tailored by machines into plane parts and cured inside giant pressure-cooking autoclaves. Analysts say these parts cost around 30-40 percent more to produce than aluminium. Under the new technology, instead of using fibre that is pre-impregnated with resin, parts are made from a dry-fibre engineered textile which is placed in a mould and then infused with resin under a vacuum. The parts can then be cured in an oven without pressure, a process estimated to cost 25 percent more than metal. Ultimately, that gap needs to narrow significantly or disappear. Boatbuilders and windfarm makers have used this method for years. Secondary airplane parts have also been made that way. But although Canada’s Bombardier partly used the technique for its CSeries, it was rare for flight-critical parts before the designers of the new Russian plane chose it for the wing. The MS-21 has yet to score large sales but has been able to catch onto the latest manufacturing wave at a time when Western giants are starting to think beyond their recently upgraded models to future designs. “This is an excellent technology demonstrator because it is on a real programme and a primary-structure part,” said Frank Nickisch, global director of strategic projects at Solvay Composite Materials, which provided materials for the MS-21. He noted that the wings on the MS-21 are of comparable size to a Boeing 737 or Airbus A320. Still, more needs to be done to bring down costs. And composite firms are not yet ready to support output at speeds planemakers have in mind. Industry sources say Boeing is expected to build 20-30 of its proposed mid-market planes a month, about twice the rate for the 787. Future 737 and A320 replacements are likely to be closer to the 60-80 mark. Nickisch said the proposed new Boeing middle-market aircraft would be a good test case for whether the industry can switch to a higher tempo using the widely expected composites. Yet tough planemaker targets on cost, performance and output require progress on three fronts: cheaper materials, wider automation and computer simulation to ensure new technology works first time, following widespread delays with new jet programmes. “Prepreg technology has been developing for 40 years, based on day-to-day knowledge. But to bring in a new process we need to be able to predict it first, with databanks,” Girardy said.

McIntyre May 29, 2017 7:51 am EDT Print Email Tweet Russia has built its own commercial airplane. This is a potential long term threat to Boeing (NYSE: BA) and Airbus which between them own the commercial aircraft business worldwide. Russia’s Irkut Corporation reported it had cleared a major milestone with a test flight during which its MC-21-300 “flew 30 minutes at the altitude of 1000 meters, at the speed of 300 km/hour.” While this does not compare to the flight duration and altitude levels which are routine to Airbus and Boeing planes, it is a reasonable start on the path which would allow Irkut to sell planes within several years. The company said it has reached several milestones in the recent test: The flight plan included checking of in-flight stability and controllability, and also the controllability of the power plant. According to the program, during the flight a simulated landing approach was performed, followed by a flight over the runway, climbing and turning. This technique is typical for the maiden flight of new types of aircraft. The MC-21-300 will eventually carry 163 to 211 passengers, which Irkut describes as the largest segment of the airline market. It also said the MC-21-300 will compete well with existing planes because of polymer composite materials. This lightens the aircraft, which Irkut says will reduce operating costs by between 12% and 15% in contrast to its direct competitors. And, its most director competitor is one of the most successful plane in the world, the Boeing 737 MAX 8, which is sometimes called the 737-8. The first 737 went into service in 1968. Boeing has made almost 9,500 planes across the entire model line which has been updates several times. The new 737 MAX 8 began production 2014, had its firsts flight in January 2016, and its first delivery, to Malindo Air, this month. Boeing says it has over 700 orders for the new plane While there is a chance the MC-21-300 will sell sell it Russia, it has a very long and hard climb to replace one of the most popular commercial aircraft in the world, made by one of the world’s largest and most well funded companies, which has a history of delivering tens of thousands of planes By Douglas A.

The MS-21, a new single aisle airliner produced by Russia's United Aircraft Corporation, is the first passenger plane borne aloft by lightweight carbon-composite wings built without a costly pressurised oven called an autoclave. The manufacturing process provides a test for a technology already being assessed by Western rivals, who are looking for cheaper and faster ways to build some of their aircaft with composites, according to aerospace executives and suppliers. Even as it sets up the world's largest autoclaves to make wings for its giant 777X, Boeing is exploring alternatives for its "New Midsize Airplane" (NMA), in the middle of the market between its big wide-body jets and best-selling 737. "There's a good chance part of the NMA will be built without autoclaves," a person familiar with the project said. A Boeing spokesman said it was studying mid-market opportunities and declined further comment. Sources say Boeing's choice of technology for its two-aircraft NMA family will lay the foundation for the next generation of its money-spinning 737, expected to appear from 2030 and last well into the second half of the century. Boeing has not yet discussed this part of its strategy publicly, but industry sources said it may include a trio of jets seating 160 to 210 people and built using broadly the same production system as the one developed for the NMA. Both families of planes are likely to be built for 30 years and stay in service for another 20-30. So today's technology choices represent a colossal 75-year bet. Airbus too is monitoring the technology as it considers how to respond to Boeing's mid-market jet, CNN reported last month. Airbus has declined to comment on the report. PIVOTAL DECISION Composites have been used in aviation since the 1970s but achieved a breakthrough in the past decade as the Boeing 787 Dreamliner and Airbus A350 entered service, promising to save money on fuel by replacing most metal parts with lighter carbon. Those are long-haul jets, which means that the savings on fuel are worthwhile even though the planes are expensive to build. For short-haul planes that burn less fuel, like the NMA or future 737, it is more important to find cheaper ways to build them, and avoiding the need for autoclaves could help. Betting on technology that does not require an autoclave is a gamble also for composite suppliers like U.S.-based Hexcel, Solvay of Belgium and Toray of Japan, whose share of aerospace manufacturing is growing. At a recent JEC composites fair in Paris, Hexcel and Solvay showcased out-of-autoclave prototype parts as they gear up to supply manufacturers on a bigger scale. "It's one of the big questions now in aerospace: how to produce out-of-autoclave on a large scale and at high speeds," said Henri Girardy, business development manager at Hexcel Composites, adding jetmakers would accept no cut in performance. Boeing's Dreamliner and the Airbus A350 are built from carbon fibre already impregnated with resin, called "prepreg", which is supplied to jetmakers, tailored by machines into plane parts and cured inside giant pressure-cooking autoclaves. Analysts say these parts cost around 30-40 percent more to produce than aluminium. Under the new technology, instead of using fibre that is pre-impregnated with resin, parts are made from a dry-fibre engineered textile which is placed in a mould and then infused with resin under a vacuum. The parts can then be cured in an oven without pressure, a process estimated to cost 25 percent more than metal. Ultimately, that gap needs to narrow significantly or disappear. Boatbuilders and windfarm makers have used this method for years. Secondary airplane parts have also been made that way. But although Canada's Bombardier partly used the technique for its CSeries, it was rare for flight-critical parts before the designers of the new Russian plane chose it for the wing. The MS-21 has yet to score large sales but has been able to catch onto the latest manufacturing wave at a time when Western giants are starting to think beyond their recently upgraded models to future designs. "This is an excellent technology demonstrator because it is on a real programme and a primary-structure part," said Frank Nickisch, global director of strategic projects at Solvay Composite Materials, which provided materials for the MS-21. He noted that the wings on the MS-21 are of comparable size to a Boeing 737 or Airbus A320. Still, more needs to be done to bring down costs. And composite firms are not yet ready to support output at speeds planemakers have in mind. Industry sources say Boeing is expected to build 20-30 of its proposed mid-market planes a month, about twice the rate for the 787. Future 737 and A320 replacements are likely to be closer to the 60-80 mark. Nickisch said the proposed new Boeing middle-market aircraft would be a good test case for whether the industry can switch to a higher tempo using the widely expected composites. Yet tough planemaker targets on cost, performance and output require progress on three fronts: cheaper materials, wider automation and computer simulation to ensure new technology works first time, following widespread delays with new jet programmes. "Prepreg technology has been developing for 40 years, based on day-to-day knowledge. But to bring in a new process we need to be able to predict it first, with databanks," Girardy said.

The complaint against Bombardier is designed to prevent the Montreal-based company from using subsidies to produce a larger version of the CSeries plane, pictured, that would compete with Boeing’s 737 aircraft.   (CLEMENT SABOURIN / AFP/GETTY IMAGES)   By Ross MarowitsThe Canadian Press Mon., May 29, 2017 MONTREAL—Boeing says its trade complaint against Bombardier is designed to prevent the Montreal-based rival from using subsidies to build a larger version of the CSeries plane that would directly compete with its own flagship narrowbody 737 aircraft. Last week, Boeing filed a document with the U.S. International Trade Commission that sheds new light on the tit-for-tat dispute between the two aerospace manufacturers. In the 109-page filing, Boeing said Bombardier would be positioned to build a full-fleet of single-aisle planes — repeating a strategy employed by French aerospace company Airbus — if Canadian subsidies to Bombardier are left unaddressed. Read more: Bombardier and Boeing clash in trade dispute over CSeries Article Continued Below Bombardier accused of dumping CSeries jets at ‘absurdly low’ prices in trade spat “The U.S. industry has been the victim of this exact strategy before, as subsidies to Airbus enabled it to push McDonnell Douglas and Lockheed from the market, and capture 50 per cent global market share, destroying countless high-paying, skilled U.S. jobs in the process,” Boeing said. Bombardier said in a separate filing that Boeing’s effort to shut down its innovative technology from the market is “misguided,” adding that the complaint is tantamount to asking the U.S. International Trade Commission to imagine a hypothetical world in the future. The company said its CSeries commercial jet isn’t an imminent threat to Boeing because the first planes won’t be delivered to Delta for another year, Boeing doesn’t sell a comparable product and Boeing’s 737 production is sold out for about eight years with a backlog valued at about $190 billion (U.S.), Bombardier said. “Using this case as an Airbus ‘do-over’ is a misuse of the statutory threat provision,” Bombardier said. Bombardier also rejected Boeing’s claim that it is suffering present material injury as a result of Delta Air Lines’ CSeries order. “If Boeing were correct that Delta established momentum for Bombardier, and caused harm to Boeing, one would expect to see additional CSeries orders in the U.S. market, but not one has occurred in the 13 months since the Delta purchase of CS100s,” Bombardier said. Boeing’s 737 fleet is expected to generate $26 billion in free cash flow over the next four years, but the Chicago-based firm said it would be wrong to assume that it is not vulnerable to the threat subsidies pose, as the history with Airbus shows. The dispute has become politically charged, with Ottawa recently announcing that it was reviewing current military procurement projects with Boeing — a thinly veiled threat to scrap the planned purchase of 18 Super Hornet fighter jets from the company. Boeing has petitioned the U.S. Commerce Department and the U.S. International Trade Commission to investigate subsidies for Bombardier’s CSeries aircraft that it says have allowed the company to export planes at well below cost. A preliminary determination on the petition is expected by June 12.

(AFP) Hollywood star John Travolta has donated his "beloved" Boeing 707 plane to an Australian aviation museum and is aiming to be part of the crew to deliver the vintage aircraft. Made for Qantas Airways in 1964, the "Saturday Night Fever" heartthrob and qualified pilot acquired the jet when Australia's national carrier retired it more than 30 years later. "It gives me great pleasure to make this exciting historical announcement that my beloved Boeing 707 aircraft has been donated to the Historical Aircraft Restoration society (HARS)," Travolta, a Qantas ambassador since 2002, said in a statement. Australian aircraft preservation organisation HARS will help restore the plane so it can make the journey from the United States to their base some 90 miles (145 kilometres) from Sydney. A date for the flight is not yet fixed but the actor, a long-time aviation buff, said he plans to be on it. "The aircraft currently requires a lot of work to be restored to a safe flying state and having seen first hand the dedication and passion of people at HARS, I have no doubt this beautiful and historical aircraft will be flying again," Travolta said. "I am hoping to be part of the crew to fly the aircraft to Australia." HARS President Bob De La Hunty said the idea was first floated when he met Travolta in 2009 and the pair flew a Qantas 1955 Super Constellation aircraft along Australia's east coast. "We share a mutual respect for old airplanes and flying and at that stage we were keen to suggest to him that if he ever wanted to part with his Boeing 707 we would be very interested in it," De La Hunty told broadcaster ABC. "When we heard earlier this year that he was looking at possibly not continuing with his Boeing 707, we made contact. He jumped at the idea and so we've been in detailed discussions and negotiations since." Boeing 707s dominated passenger aircraft in the 1960s, helping usher in an era of long-range travel which had previously been dominated by rail and sea.

The American giants are in the cross-hairs of an Israeli lawyer with a track record of humbling huge corporations and winning multi-million-dollar settlements for her clients. Attorney Nitsana Darshan-Leitner has spent the past decade filing lawsuits for the victims of terror attacks against the governments, banks and corporations that enabled or financed the violence. As a result of her efforts, more than $200 million has been collected for terror victims and their families (including out of court settlements), and some $600 million in assets has been frozen. Darshan-Leitner has also used the courts to fight against what she considers to be unfair lawsuits against Israeli military commanders. In one notable case, she stopped a Spanish lawsuit against Israel’s Chief of Staff Dan Halutz over a bombing raid in Gaza by filing a similar suit against Javier Solana, a top Spanish politician who had overseen NATO’s bombing of Kosovo. Spain changed the law. The Bar-Ilan University-educated mother of six will speak about her work in a live interview in Jerusalem on Sunday, June 4 in our next Times of Israel Presents event, produced in association with Nefesh B’Nefesh. (Book tickets HERE). Last year, she won an unprecedented $655 million verdict against the Palestinian Authority and PLO on behalf of 11 American families whose loved ones had been killed or injured in attacks in Israel. That decision was overturned by the US Court of Appeal, but Darshan-Leitner says she is not deterred. Nitsana Darshan-Leitner, with the Shurat HaDin Israel Law Center and representing those affected by attacks in Israel in the early 2000s, walks from a federal courthouse in New York on February 23, 2015. (photo credit: AP Photo/Craig Ruttle) Darshan-Leitner and Shurat Hadin, the non-profit law center she heads, are self-funding and do not receive backing from any government, including that of Israel. Sometimes she can be more effective even than the Israeli army: In 2011, she prevented a Gaza-bound activists’ flotilla from leaving Greece after challenging the seaworthiness of the vessels in a local court. Now she has discovered that Lebanon-based terrorist group Hezbollah is using Western Union to channel funds, and Iran is planning to use Boeing aircraft to deliver missiles to Syria. She plans to sue them both. “Hezbollah is launching a fundraising campaign and using Western Union to accept the donations, so one of the moves that we are planning is to go after Western Union,” says Darshan-Leitner. “In addition, we learned that Boeing not only signed a horrible deal with Iran providing them with 80 aircraft with a special waiver for the sanctions, Iran actually is using these aircraft to deliver missiles into Syria and let Hezbollah drive them to South Lebanon to shoot them over Israel. Attorney Nitsana Darshan-Leitner: ‘Hezbollah is launching a fundraising campaign and using Western Union to accept the donations.’ (courtesy) “We are suing Boeing now to stop the deal, and we are launching a campaign to put pressure on the administration not to let Boeing continue,” she says. Darshan-Leitner is also suing Facebook, Twitter and other social media giants for their alleged role in “facilitating” terror activity. “Facebook, Twitter and Google provide material support in the form of social media network services to Hamas, to ISIS. This is unacceptable. It’s also a violation of American law. So we’ve filed lawsuits against them as well,” she says. Are the courts the right battleground to fight terrorism? Does her work encourage Israel’s enemies to resort to their own “lawfare” against Israeli targets? We’ll be asking those questions and more when we interview Darshan-Leitner on June 4. Join us for what promises to be a fascinating conversation and the chance to meet one of Israel’s most dynamic lawyers.

    * Unannounced, Russia stages test flight of new passenger
plane
    * MS-21 seen competing against Airbus, Boeing best-sellers
    * Officials hope cheaper running costs will win sales

    By Gleb Stolyarov and Jack StubbsMOSCOW, May 28 (Reuters) - Russia carried out the maiden
flight of its new MS-21 medium-range passenger plane on Sunday,
its first post-Soviet foray into production of a mainline
commercial aircraft which it hopes will rival those of its
Western competitors.
    In a surprise statement, manufacturer Irkut Corporation
<IRKT.MM> and its state-controlled parent company United
Aircraft Corporation (UAC) <UNAC.MM> said an MS-21-300 model had
successfully completed a 30-minute flight at a height of 1,000
metres and travelling at 300 km an hour.
    Squeezed by Western sanctions over its role in the Ukraine
crisis, Russia is trying to rejuvenate domestic industrial
production to make the country less dependant on foreign firms.
    The test flight, which was not announced to media
beforehand, comes just three weeks after China staged the maiden
flight of its new C919 passenger jet, highlighting the growing
competition to industry heavyweights Boeing <BA.N> and Airbus
<AIR.PA>.
    Russian officials have said the MS-21 is superior to its
Western-made counterparts in many respects and will be snapped
up by both Russian and foreign carriers, but Western analysts
say both Russia and China face a huge challenge to shatter the
transatlantic airplane duopoly. [nL8N19052L]
    "The flight mission has been completed. The flight was fine,
there were no observations which will prevent further testing,"
test pilot Oleg Kononenko was quoted as saying.
    Western aviation sources however expressed surprise at the
flight's brevity and relatively low altitude compared with
recent 3-4 hour debuts of North American and European models.
    "It suggests they either have severe limitations or may have
had something happen and decided to come back," said a Western
flight test engineer, speaking on condition of anonymity.
    A Western jetmaking source called it a "genteel flight".
    A UAC spokesman said the flight had been long enough to test
everything that needed checking in the air.
    Russia has fought hard to shake off its Soviet reputation
for old and creaking aircraft flown by inexperienced crews.
    Flag carrier Aeroflot <AFLT.MM> last year earned its fourth
star from independent ratings website Skytrax, ranking it
alongside major European and Middle Eastern competitors and
ahead of big U.S. carriers such as Delta and United.

    FIRM ORDERS
    President Vladimir Putin called Irkut General Director Oleg
Demchenko to congratulate him and his employees with what the
Kremlin called "a significant event".
    The twin-engine MS-21 will be built in two variants: the
MS-21-300 which will have 160-211 seats, and the later MS-21-200
which will have 130-165 seats. It is sometimes referred to as
the MC-21 when using the Russian name and Cyrillic letters.
    Production is expected to start in the next two years and
state media have said numerous contracts with domestic and
foreign carriers have already been agreed. Irkut said it so far
had "firm orders" for 175 planes.
    America's Boeing and Europe's Airbus remain far ahead of
their Chinese and Russian rivals, with bigger sales books and
more advanced technical know-how.
    But the new plane could win sales in Russia and some eastern
European and Asian countries, industry analysts say, with buyers
attracted by its lower running costs.
    Irkut said operational costs for its new plane will be up to
15 percent cheaper than current generation aircraft.
    With a range of up to 6,000 kilometres, the MS-21 will be
competing against the Boeing 737 and Airbus A320 aircraft which
currently dominate the medium-range narrow-body market. Both
companies recently upgraded those families to achieve comparable
15 percent operational savings compared to previous versions.
    State defence conglomerate Rostec, which is headed by close
Putin ally Sergei Chemezov, said it had agreed to purchase 85
aircraft. At least 50 of them will be leased to Aeroflot, Rostec
said, which currently operates a fleet dominated by narrow-body
Airbus models, including 70 A320s.
    UAC President Yury Slyusar said he estimated global demand
for the new MS-21 models at around 15,000 aircraft over the next
20 years. "I'm sure the airlines will appreciate our new
aircraft," he said.

Jamie Burgess, Vice-President and Program Manager for Boeing Military Aircraft Mobility Surveillance and Engagement division "The size of the 737 is about right for a [command and control] C2 mission crew that would be spending upwards of 12 hours on an aircraft. It also offers tremendous growth potential in terms of power, size, weight, cooling, and aircraft performance." said Jamie Burgess, Vice-President and Program Manager for Boeing Military Aircraft Mobility Surveillance and Engagement division, told IHS Janes. "We think the 737-700 is the right solution for the air force's [C2 and intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance] C2ISR recapitalization." The current fleet of 16 Air Force Northrop Grumman E-8C JSTARS dates back to the early 1990's. The E-8C is based off the 707 airframe, which suffers from high operating costs at as much as $200,000 an hour. There is also a lack of spare parts and airframes available. Multiple companies are bidding for the program. The JSTARS features a radar system that can cover a theater-sized battlefield region. It is meant to provide ground and area commanders with long-range ground surveillance.

The US government awarded Boeing, the world's largest aerospace company, $1.48 billion for the development of a "Redesigned Kill Vehicle", the Pentagon said in a statement last week. The extra money brings the total publicly known value of the US government contract with Boeing to a whopping $7.78 billion. The White House wants to upgrade the system before Kim Jong-un develops the capabilities to strike the continental US. So what is a kill vehicle? Simply put, kill vehicles intercept and destroy long-range ballistic missiles. Launched atop missiles of their own, they use sensors, lenses and rocket thrusters to pick out ballistic warheads and steer into their path. When it comes to shooting down ballistic missiles "there is a fundamental difference in the technology - whether you want it to do that inside the atmosphere or in space," says Dr Stephan Fruehling from the ANU's Strategic and Defence Studies Centre. In the case of medium and long range missiles coming from North Korea, an Exoatmospheric Kill Vehicle (EKV) which intercepts the missile in space would be the technology of choice. If a threat is detected by a system of sensors based on land or on warships at sea, then a Ground-Based Interceptor (GBI) will be launched into space using a rocket booster. Once outside the Earth's atmosphere, operating at the edge of space at hypersonic speeds, the kill vehicle is deployed. It seeks out the target using sensors, a sophisticated on-board computer and a rocket motor used for steering in space. It hones in on the missile and destroys it using nothing more than the force of a massive collision. Continued below.

MULTIPLE FAILURES Leader Kim Jong Un at what was said to be a missile test site. Photo / AP The technology has been around for more than two decades but it hasn't always worked as intended. In fact it's been hugely problematic. In 2010 a meticulously controlled test of its missile defence technology at a site in Alaska ended in embarrassment for the US military. Despite knowing the exact speed and coordinates of the target, the intercepting kill vehicle completely missed the fake warhead. Eleven months later, when the US Missile Defense Agency staged a repeat of the test, it again failed. During a test in July 2013 success once again proved elusive, raising serious questions over missile defence system the Pentagon had poured more than $US40 billion ($A53 billion) dollars into. A test conducted last year was announced as a success but it was later revealed that one of the thrusters malfunctioned, causing the interceptor to fly offcourse. Dr Stephan Fruehling is a Chief Investigator on the Australian Research Council's project on nuclear deterrence and was a member of the Australian Government's external panel of experts on the 2016 Defence White Paper. He says the latest contract awarded to Boeing by the US military is about reinventing a kill vehicle that isn't wedded to ageing technology. The United States deployed an operational GBI system in California and Alaska which was rushed into the field after September 11 under the George W. Bush administration. Essentially the system is situated to intercept missiles from rogue states like North Korean or Iran during their trajectory to the continental United States. But much of the system was based on technology from the previous decade, which has been plagued with issued since testing began in 1999. "It has a lot of limitations," Dr Fruehling told news.com.au. "And essentially what the US is stuck with is evolutions of a kill vehicle that remains based on this technology from the 1990s ... and that's caused a lot of problems that they've had with that system." WHY ARE THEY INVESTING IN NEW TECHNOLOGY NOW? May 22, 2017: Photo distributed by the North Korean government shows a missile lifting off during its launch test at an undisclosed location in North Korea. Photo / AP With North Korea continuing to test nuclear warheads at a feverish pace, the Pentagon is racing to improve its kill vehicle technology. "What this is about now is taking a step back and developing a interceptor that addresses those issues," Dr Fruehling said. CALLS FOR AUSTRALIA TO DEVELOP MISSILE SHIELD A woman watches a TV screen showing a file footage of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, at Seoul Train Station in Seoul, South Korea. Photo / AP Advances in missile technology made by North Korea - as well as China - in the past few years have taken some western analysts by surprise. And the situation has led to growing calls for Australia to develop its own missile shield. Defence specialist Andrew Shearer who previously worked as a national security adviser to Prime Ministers John Howard and Tony Abbott is among those who believe Australia needs to invest in this area. He wants the government to examine systems "to defend the continent against the new and growing threat posed by long-range ballistic missiles that could be used to strike or intimidate future Australian governments". "The cumulative effective of these capabilities is to increase the missile threat to ADF forces deployed forward in the (Asia) region, whether independently or as part of an allied coalition," he told Fairfax Media last month. He also warned that over time such weapons could be used to "reduce Australia's strategic depth and put Australian and allied forces operating from rear bases on the mainland at greater risk. "The latter is a new threat but one that will become very real over the next decade," he said. According to Dr Fruehling "there has been an ongoing debate about whether Australia should actually acquire interceptors. But so far that's not been done." Largely because it's not really a threat Australia could thwart on its own with current technology. "If you look at the threat to Australia from intercontinental ballistic missile, there's little that Australia could do to address that on its own," he said. "If you look at North Korean missiles, for example, you'd have to have a ship with SM3 (a ship-based missile interception system) off the North Korean coast. Or you would have to base ground based interceptors in northern Australia but you would be looking at sensor infrastructure and an investment cost that runs into the dozens of billions, so it's not really feasible." But that certainly doesn't mean Australia isn't engaged in aspects of missile defence systems on the research and development side of things. "There's been some technology co-operation, even going back to the 1990s" with our US ally but these experiments have been "largely in the sensor space in terms of looking at the overall horizon radar and how that could be to detect missiles," Dr Fruehling said. "There is some scope for integrating some Australian sensors into missile defence systems," he said. - news.com.au By Nick Whigham Email Print Get the news delivered straight to your inbox Receive the day’s news, sport and entertainment in our daily email newsletter SIGN UP NOW Loading Discover more Loading Loading Herald Services Book your ad Driven Photos for sale True Commercial Death Notices Public Notices Our Regional News Stories The Northern Advocate Wings will flutter at Rimu Park A project to lift monarch butterfly numbers is also hoping to lift residents' spirits… Hawke's Bay Today Doctor tells court 'I did not commit that' He described feeling shocked to learn that a complaint had been laid against him.

The Irkut MC-21 is designed to compete with the most popular airliners in the world, the single-aisle Boeing (BA) 737 and Airbus (EADSF) A320. By Jon Ostrower SEATTLE (CNNMoney) -- Russia's first large airliner since the fall of the Soviet Union made its maiden flight Sunday. The Irkut MC-21 is designed to compete with the most popular airliners in the world, the single-aisle Boeing 737 and Airbus A320. The prototype took flight Sunday morning from the Irkutsk Aviation Plant airfield in Siberia, about 2,600 miles west of Moscow. During the 30-minute flight, the plane reached an altitude of 1,000 meters (roughly 3,300 feet). Oleg Kononenko, the flight's lead test pilot, reported that the aircraft operated normally. The MC-21's maiden flight was notably shorter than that of its Chinese competitor and other similar aircraft, which have typically flown for an hour or longer and at a higher altitude. The flight comes ahead of the Paris Air Show, which starts June 18. Irkut hasn't yet said whether the jet will be ready in time to make its international debut at the event. The Russian aircraft's debut is the latest in a series of aviation firsts in 2017. The unusually busy year has featured a parade of maiden flights by new models from airplane makers around the world. China's new challenge to Boeing and Airbus, the Comac C919, made its first flight on May 5. But while Russia is pushing the MC-21 with airlines around the world as a way to increase its non-military aerospace exports, Comac has shown less interest in selling the C919 overseas. Russia's commercial aerospace industry has struggled over the past quarter century to regain the strength it had during the Soviet era. Through projects backed by President Vladimir Putin, it has sought to shed its reputation for advanced, but unreliable, passenger aircraft. The country last week formalized a partnership with China to made a long-range twin-aisle airliner to compete with Boeing and Airbus. The MC-21 is expected to start flying passengers in 2019 after it completes testing. Russian airline Aeroflot will be the first to fly the new jetliner. The state-run carrier has relied heavily on Airbus and Boeing jets as part of its modernization, but Russian policy has encouraged the introduction of homegrown models, like the MC-21. Irkut says the MC-21, which seats 163 passengers in two classes, will be 12% to 15% less expensive to operate than its Western counterparts. The manufacturer has taken 175 orders for the jet, which has a range of about 3,500 nautical miles or 6,400 kilometers. Irkut is an arm of the Russian state-owned aerospace conglomerate United Aircraft Corporation, which supplies the country's airborne military hardware. Like the Chinese C919, the MC-21 has used many Western aerospace suppliers. The jet took the sky on Sunday powered by two U.S.-made Pratt & Whitney geared turbofan engines, which are also used by Airbus, Canada's Bombardier and Brazil's Embraer. Russia is developing a new engine of its own for the MC-21. While the Russian aerospace industry has lagged U.S. and European companies, Airbus and Boeing are closely watching the new jet's progress. The MC-21 is packed with advanced carbon fiber technology and flight controls that haven't yet made their way to Boeing and Airbus aircraft.

Canales lashes out over killed bill By PAUL COBLER | Special To The Herald Brownsville Herald AUSTIN — McAllen’s payment to Enrique Iglesias for a 2015 holiday performance may never become public information, and state Rep. Terry Canales is not happy about it. On Wednesday night, Sen. Charles Schwertner, R-Georgetown, removed House Bill 349, Canales’ bill, from the Texas Senate’s Local and Consent Calendar. This effectively killed the bill by preventing it from being read on the Senate floor before the end of the legislative session next Monday. “He did it because it’s a chink in the armor and takes a piece of the Boeing ruling away,” Canales said. “They don’t want the sweater to unravel, and he wants to keep the public in the dark.” The bill reversed a very narrow portion of the Texas Supreme Court’s Boeing Ruling, which was cited when the City of McAllen refused to disclose the price tag for the Iglesias concert. If the bill had passed, it would have wiped out the contract between McAllen and Iglesias, forcing the city to disclose the payment. In a personal privilege speech on the House floor, Canales, D-Edinburg, ripped into Schwertner for his decision to kill HB 349, calling him a “villain” who “dwells in the shadows of corporate greed.” Prior to the speech, Canales approached Schwertner on the Senate floor, poked him in the shoulder and said next session he would block every piece of legislation Schwertner authored that was sent to the House. Sen. Juan “Chuy” Hinojosa, who was carrying HB 349 in the Senate, said Schwertner told him he removed the bill from the calendar as retribution for Canales calling a point of order on one of his bills, Senate Bill 11. A point of order is a request to the House Parliamentarian to review that the bill is not breaking any House rules, but commonly can be used as a legislative delay tactic. “ Sometimes, at this point in the session, people get overly emotional and retaliate,” Hinojosa said. “I was not notified he was going to pull the bill from the calendar, which is usually the protocol here. I was disappointed Sen. Schwertner didn’t notify me, because I could have talked to him and probably persuaded him not to do that.” Canales said he believes Schwertner killed the bill because of its intention to expand government transparency in Texas. “(Schwertner) says the bill was killed because of a point of order, but no point of order was ever sustained on one of his bills,” Canales said. “The reason for him to kill the bill was protecting corporate industry.” Schwertner did not respond to a request for comment. The death of HB 349 leaves no legislation supporting open government in Texas left standing, according to Kelley Shannon, the executive director of the Freedom of Information Foundation of Texas. “Legislators should definitely not be playing games with open government,” Shannon said. “It’s a basic right of the people of Texas to know how their government operates and to know how their government uses their taxpayer dollars. When they play games with open-government, they are playing games with the voters of Texas.” In his personal privilege speech, Canales called on legislators to do better when it comes to open-government legislation. “If you don’t have the spine to stand for transparency, you don’t have the right to stand for Texas,” Canales said in his speech. “To my understanding, Sen. Schwertner is an orthopedic surgeon, which I find ironic because he doesn’t have a spine.”  Discuss Print Posted in Valley on Sunday, May 28, 2017 10:38 pm.

DARPA  Email  Print  Reddit  Tweet  Share  Google  More By JUSTIN BACHMAN | Bloomberg | Published: May 28, 2017 In the future, military dominance will depend partly on how fast you can fly and how quickly you can get into space. That's one of the guiding principles behind an advanced Pentagon project to build a spacecraft able to launch smaller payloads into low-earth orbit on short notice, and at lower cost. Boeing Co.'s XS-1 (Experimental Spaceplane), which the company dubs "Phantom Express," got a green light this week by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, or Darpa. The XS-1 is designed to quickly lift satellites as heavy as 3,000 pounds into orbit for $5 million or less, launching from the ground, deploying a small upper-stage module, and then landing like a traditional airplane-the key to reuse and lower operating expense. Darpa also has a separate program aimed at launching 100-pound satellites for less than $1 million per launch, using conventional aircraft. "The XS-1 would be neither a traditional airplane nor a conventional launch vehicle but rather a combination of the two, with the goal of lowering launch costs by a factor of ten and replacing today's frustratingly long wait time with launch on demand," Jess Spoonable, a Darpa program manager, said in a May 24 statement. The Phantom Express will be powered with an Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings Inc. AR-22 engine, a newer version of the main engine trio that served on NASA's Space Shuttle. Boeing will design and build the aircraft through 2019, including 10 engine ground firings over 10 days, followed by 12-15 flight tests in 2020. A Boeing spokeswoman declined to comment on the project's cost. Beyond the military's desire for a spaceplane, such a craft would likely carry immense appeal for commercial companies, many of which are planning to launch constellations of small satellites. These companies don't need the weight capability, or large expense, associated with traditional payload launches sold by United Launch Alliance, the Boeing-Lockheed Martin Corp. joint venture, Arianespace, or Elon Musk's SpaceX. The XS-1 is also envisioned as a means to further engineering work on advanced airframe designs capable of hypersonic flight, generally five to 10 times above Mach 1, the speed of sound at sea level (approximately 767 miles-per-hour). Historically, these designs have been challenged due to the intense friction and heat generated by higher Mach speeds. Beyond a quick pop into space, a craft with hypersonic speed offers the Pentagon a new capability-an aircraft deployable anywhere in the world in less than three hours. "When most people think about hypersonic aircraft, many believe they would have to be large, expensive, and exotic," Lockheed Martin says. "It's time we change that perception." One way the defense contractor is trying to do that is with the next generation of the SR-71 Blackbird, the Cold War-era speed demon able to fly at Mach 3, which provided critical reconnaissance for the Air Force until the late 1990s, when it was retired. The SR-71 still holds numerous speed and altitude records. The new Lockheed Skunk Works project, called the SR-72, is a proposal envisioning an unmanned aircraft that cruises at Mach 6 - roughly twice as fast as the 2,300-mile-per-hour SR-71 - meaning "an adversary would have no time to react or hide," Lockheed Martin says in its promotional materials. A Skunk Works spokeswoman declined to comment on hypersonic projects. The SR-72 could be operational by 2030, for less than $1 billion, according to the company, which has been touting the aircraft for several years. Boeing has previously experimented with hypersonic flight with its X-51 WaveRider, a small scramjet platform, dropped from a B-52 bomber, which flew its last test mission in 2013 over the Pacific. The X-51 topped Mach 5, or about 4,000 mph. In the 1960s, NASA experimented with the manned X-15, a high-altitude, hypersonic flight program to inform future space missions. In 1967, the X-15 achieved a record Mach 6.7 (4,520 mph) at more than 102,000 feet. DARPA has selected The Boeing Company to complete advanced design work for the Agency’s Experimental Spaceplane (XS-1) program.

The company said Wednesday that it still plans to deliver the first Boeing 737 Max later this month, and production will continue. A Boeing 737 MAX 9 under construction at the company's production facility in Renton, Washington, on Feb. 13. Jason Redmond / Reuters file The news sent Boeing Co. shares down nearly 4 percent, although they recovered partly to close at $183.18, down $2.31, or 1.3 percent. Chicago-based Boeing was notified last week of a potential issue involving turbine engine discs produced by a supplier to engine maker CFM International. Boeing said it has not experienced any problems with the discs during more than 2,000 hours of testing. It poses no safety concerns for travelers because no airlines are yet flying the 737 Max but it could mean a costly disruption if the problem persists. Timely delivery is important to planemakers as they get most of the payment for a plane when it is handed to the buyer. The Max is designed to be a more fuel-efficient version of the workhorse 737, Boeing's most popular commercial plane. Malaysia's Malindo Air plans to take delivery of the first Max in a few days and begin using it for passenger flights before July. Dallas-based Southwest Airlines Co. expects to begin using the plane this fall. It said Boeing had not warned it of any delays to its delivery schedule. Related: China's 'Homegrown' Competitor to 737 Takes to the Skies American Airlines Group Inc., which has 100 737 MAX jets on order, declined to comment when contacted by Reuters. The discs in question are made by a supplier to CFM International, a joint venture of General Electric and France's Safran. GE spokeswoman Jamie Jewell declined to identify the supplier. She said GE and Safran will work with the supplier to find and correct any shortcomings in the manufacturing process while also turning to a backup supplier to keep production of engines on schedule.

Jason Redmond / AFP - Getty Images file In a written statement, Boeing said it will work with CFM "to understand the precise scope and root cause of the quality issue." New planes and parts go through extensive testing to turn up problems before passengers go on board. Cai von Rumohr, an analyst with Cowen and Co., said "this doesn't look like a serious concern" because Boeing still expects to deliver the first plane this month and it appears to be a fixable manufacturing problem rather than a design flaw. Boeing has built about 9,500 single-aisle 737s since the late 1960s. The company said it has taken more than 3,700 orders for the Max, which carries a list price of $112.4 million to $119.2 million, although airlines routinely get big discounts.

New Russian jet takes to air in bid to rival Airbus, Boeing | Bangkok Post: business News Business Video Photos Opinion Lifestyle Auto Jobs Property Travel Learning Tech More BUSINESS Log in Sign up Web search MENU Search Switch Archive E-PAPER SIGN IN About E-Paper Subscribe Free Trial Report problem Contact us Business homepage Business news Telecom Finance Tourism & transport Find company & suppliers Exchange rates More World Gold prices IT Auto Property Business > World New Russian jet takes to air in bid to rival Airbus, Boeing 30 May 2017 at 09:00 388 viewed0 comments NEWSPAPER SECTION: BUSINESS | WRITER: REUTERS An MS-21 medium-range passenger plane takes off in Irkutsk, Russia on Sunday. (Irkut Corporation via Reuters) - + MOSCOW: Russia carried out the maiden flight of its new MS-21 medium-range passenger plane on Sunday, its first post-Soviet foray into production of a mainline commercial aircraft which it hopes will rival those of its Western competitors. In a surprise statement, manufacturer Irkut Corporation nd its state-controlled parent company United Aircraft Corporation (UAC) said an MS-21-300 model had successfully completed a 30-minute flight at a height of 1,000 metres and travelling at 300 kilometres an hour. Squeezed by Western sanctions over its role in the Ukraine crisis, Russia is trying to rejuvenate domestic industrial production to make the country less dependant on foreign firms. The test flight, which was not announced to media beforehand, comes just three weeks after China staged the maiden flight of its new C919 passenger jet, highlighting the growing competition to industry heavyweights Boeing Co and Airbus SAS, plane-making division of Airbus SE. Russian officials have said the MS-21 is superior to its Western-made counterparts in many respects and will be snapped up by both Russian and foreign carriers, but Western analysts say both Russia and China face a huge challenge to shatter the transatlantic airplane duopoly. "The flight mission has been completed. The flight was fine, there were no observations which will prevent further testing," test pilot Oleg Kononenko was quoted as saying. Western aviation sources however expressed surprise at the flight's brevity and relatively low altitude compared with recent 3-4 hour debuts of North American and European models. "It suggests they either have severe limitations or may have had something happen and decided to come back," said a Western flight test engineer, speaking on condition of anonymity. A Western jetmaking source called it a "genteel flight". A UAC spokesman said the flight had been long enough to test everything that needed checking in the air. Russia has fought hard to shake off its Soviet reputation for old and creaking aircraft flown by inexperienced crews. Flag carrier Aeroflot last year earned its fourth star from independent ratings website Skytrax, ranking it alongside major European and Middle Eastern competitors and ahead of big US carriers such as Delta Air Lines and United Airlines. President Vladimir Putin called Irkut general director Oleg Demchenko to congratulate him and his employees with what the Kremlin called "a significant event". The twin-engine MS-21 will be built in two variants: the MS-21-300 which will have 160-211 seats, and the later MS-21-200 which will have 130-165 seats. It is sometimes referred to as the MC-21 when using the Russian name and Cyrillic letters. Production is expected to start in the next two years and state media have said numerous contracts with domestic and foreign carriers have already been agreed. Irkut said it so far had "firm orders" for 175 planes. America's Boeing and Europe's Airbus remain far ahead of their Chinese and Russian rivals, with bigger sales books and more advanced technical know-how. But the new plane could win sales in Russia and some eastern European and Asian countries, industry analysts say, with buyers attracted by its lower running costs. Irkut said operational costs for its new plane will be up to 15% cheaper than current generation aircraft. With a range of up to 6,000 kilometres, the MS-21 will be competing against the Boeing 737 and Airbus A320 aircraft which currently dominate the medium-range narrow-body market. Both companies recently upgraded those families to achieve comparable 15% operational savings compared to previous versions. State defence conglomerate Rostec, which is headed by close Putin ally Sergei Chemezov, said it had agreed to purchase 85 aircraft. "At least 50 of them will be leased to Aeroflot,'' Rostec said, which currently operates a fleet dominated by narrow-body Airbus models, including 70 A320s. UAC president Yury Slyusar said he estimated global demand for the new MS-21 models at around 15,000 aircraft over the next 20 years. "I'm sure the airlines will appreciate our new aircraft," he said.

At least 8 illegal miners die after mine shaft collapses in Zimbabwe Zim ranked 13th among world's most fragile states, report shows Mugabe's daughter Bona 'gets SECOND board appointment in a week' – report Mugabe 'not given chance to speak in Mexico' News24 Correspondent Harare - This is why he's known as Zimbabwe's 'visiting president': so far this year Robert Mugabe has spent more days outside the country he's ruled for 37 years than he's spent at home, it's been reported. Until May 27, when Mugabe got back from a week-long jaunt to Mexico, the president had spent 77 days outside the country, reports the Standard.  Only 69 days had been spent at home.  Luxury Boeing Mugabe, 93, recently had to charter a luxury Boeing as the Air Zimbabwe plane he usually uses is grounded for servicing.  The paper said Mugabe began his 2017 travels on January 17, while still on official leave in Dubai, with a trip to China.  9 countries, 3 continents Since then, the paper estimates he’s covered 145 000km, and clocked a staggering 250 hours in the air.  Countries he has so far visited on three continents include China, Ethiopia, Ghana, Mali, Mauritius, Singapore (twice), South Africa, Swaziland and Mexico. The Zimbabwe Independent, a respected business weekly, estimates that this month alone the president spent $3.5 million chartering a plane for trips to Singapore and Cancun in Mexico.  $1 million for 4 days The paper identified the plane as a Comlux Aviation Boeing 767.  “It costs one million US dollars to hire the plane for four days so Mugabe paid that when he went to Singapore,” an unnamed aviation source told the paper.  “The plane also attracted close to half a million dollars in charges when it was parked for six days, from May 13 to May 18 while the cabin crew was at a local hotel. Mugabe paid close to 2 million US dollars for the nine days the plane took him to Mexico.”  President pays  But transport minister Joram Gumbo, while declining to disclose the amount spent on the Mexico trip, suggested that chartering a plane is no more expensive than flying Air Zimbabwe.  “Air Zimbabwe is used at cost and the rates are the same. Every last penny is paid for by the president’s office,” he told the paper.  Large entourage Mugabe invariably travels with a large entourage, including state media journalists who get paid daily expenses in scarce foreign currency. Critics say the country gains nothing from these expensive trips.  Read more on:    robert mugabe  |  zimbabwe  |  southern africa Join the conversation! 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.

NEW DELHI: The CBI has registered three FIRs against unknown officials of the civil aviation ministry and private persons for alleged irregularities in UPA government's purchase of 111 aircraft for Air India and Indian Airlines at a cost of Rs 70,000 crore, leasing of a large number of aircraft by AI without due consideration, and surrendering of the debt-ridden carrier's profit-making routes and schedules to benefit private players. In addition, the agency has launched a preliminary enquiry (PE) into the 2007 merger of the two public carriers, IA and AI, to ascertain whether the matter needs to be probed further by registering an FIR. The merger followed the decision to place huge orders with Boeing and Airbus, a decision which the agency alleged cost the exchequer "tens of thousands of crores". CBI had been directed by Supreme Court to probe the decisions based on a PIL filed by activist lawyer Prashant Bhushan. It said that in its three FIRs and one PE, it has booked unknown officials of the civil aviation ministry, Air India and unknown private persons for criminal conspiracy, cheating and under the prevention of corruption Act. About the purchase of 111 planes, CBI officials said the original proposal was to buy a total of 28 planes for Air India and Indian Airlines. But the government finally decided to buy 68 for Air India from Boeing, and another 43 for Indian Airlines from Airbus. The twin decisions triggered a controversy, with the Comptroller & Auditor General (CAG) terming the decision to purchase planes through debt a "recipe for disaster", noting that the decision was taken when the airlines were "in a crisis". The federal auditor also criticised the decision to lease planes, saying they were leased from private operators even while the process to acquire new planes was underway. The CAG criticised the merger as ill-timed and said that the financial case for merger was not "adequately validated". CBI said the FIRs were based on the preliminary inquiries it conducted in the light of the SC's directive and the findings of the CAG and Parliament's Public Accounts Committee, which was also critical of the decisions. "The acquisition was done to benefit private companies," CBI alleged in its FIR into the acquisition of planes. "The entire acquisition (for both Air India and Indian Airlines) was to be funded through debt (to be repaid through revenue generation), except for a relatively small equity infusion of Rs 325 crore for Indian Airlines. This was a recipe for disaster and should have raised alarm signals in ministry of civil aviation, Public Investment Board and the Planning Commission", the CAG report had stated. It further said: "This increase in numbers does not withstand audit scrutiny, considering the market requirements obtaining then or forecast for the future, as also the commercial viability projected to justify the acquisition. The acquisition appears to be supply-driven." CBI's second FIR has been registered to probe what it called "irregular leasing of large number of aircraft by Air India without due consideration, proper route study and marketing or price strategy". The decision benefited private carriers, the CBI alleged The third FIR has been lodged to investigate AI for giving up profit making routes and timings in favour of national and international private airlines, which again led to a huge loss to the national carrier but came as a boon to private operators. Sources said the PE into the decision to merge the two airlines - the process for which started on March 16, 2006 - would focus on those who were running the civil aviation ministry at the time. Subsequently, a presentation was made to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on March 22, 2006, in which the chairman and managing directors of Indian Airlines and Air India, the deputy chairman of the Planning Commission and the civil aviation secretary were also present. The move to merge AI and IA was initiated in 2006 by the civil aviation ministry under Praful Patel and was cleared by a group of ministers which included Pranab Mukherjee and P Chidambaram, before being formally approved by the Manmohan Singh Cabinet.

Apart from Civil Aviation Ministry and Air India officials, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has booked some private unnamed companies in its FIRs lodged under sections of criminal conspiracy and cheating of Indian Penal Code and relevant sections of the Prevention of Corruption Act. The FIRs do not mention any public official by name but are built around a report by the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) submitted to Parliament in 2011 and a subsequent report by the Parliamentary Accounts Committee (PAC). Both reports pointed out glaring gaps in the acquisition process which caused to the national air carrier to face a financial crunch, a CBI official said. The cases come on the heels of the CBI raiding former Finance Minister P. Chidamabram's son Karti in a money laundering case. The agency took the step on Supreme Court's January 5 order pertaining to the affairs of the Civil Aviation ministry under the previous United Progressive Alliance government. The court has reportedly asked the CBI to complete the probe by June while hearing a public interest litigation filed by activist-lawyer Prashant Bhushan on the purchase of the Boeing aircraft.

自由電子報 | 影音娛樂 | 好康報報 | 自由部落 ‧Business Home Front Page Taiwan News Business Editorials Sports World News Features Bilingual Pages Home / Business Tue, May 30, 2017 - Page 10　 Print Mail Facebook Twitter plurk funp Russia launches maiden jet flight Reuters, MOSCOW Russia on Sunday carried out the maiden flight of its new MS-21 medium-range passenger plane, its first post-Soviet foray into production of a mainline commercial aircraft which it hopes will rival those of its Western competitors. In a surprise statement, manufacturer Irkut Corp and its state-controlled parent company, United Aircraft Corp (UAC), said an MS-21-300 model had successfully completed a 30-minute flight at a height of 1,000m and traveling at 300kph. Squeezed by Western sanctions over its role in the Ukraine crisis, Russia is trying to rejuvenate domestic industrial production to make the country less dependant on foreign firms. The test flight, which was not announced to media beforehand, comes just three weeks after China staged the maiden flight of its new C919 passenger jet, highlighting the growing competition to industry heavyweights Boeing Co and Airbus Group SE. Russian officials have said the MS-21 is superior to its Western-made counterparts in many respects and would be snapped up by both Russian and foreign carriers, but Western analysts say both Russia and China face a huge challenge to shatter the transatlantic airplane duopoly. “The flight mission has been completed. The flight was fine, there were no observations which will prevent further testing,” test pilot Oleg Kononenko was quoted as saying. However, Western aviation sources expressed surprise at the flight’s brevity and relatively low altitude compared with recent three-to-four-hour debuts of North American and European models. “It suggests they either have severe limitations or may have had something happen and decided to come back,” said a Western flight test engineer, speaking on condition of anonymity. A Western jetmaking source called it a “genteel flight.” A UAC spokesman said the flight had been long enough to test everything that needed checking in the air. Russia has fought hard to shake off its Soviet reputation for old and creaking aircraft flown by inexperienced crews. Russian President Vladimir Putin called Irkut director-general Oleg Demchenko to congratulate him and his employees on what the Kremlin called “a significant event.” The twin-engine MS-21 is to be built in two variants: the MS-21-300, which is to have 160 to 211 seats, and the later MS-21-200, which is to have 130 to 165 seats. It is sometimes referred to as the MC-21 when using the Russian name and Cyrillic letters. Production is expected to start in the next two years and Russian state media have said numerous contracts with domestic and foreign carriers have already been agreed. Irkut said it so far had “firm orders” for 175 planes. The US’ Boeing and Europe’s Airbus remain far ahead of their Chinese and Russian rivals, with bigger sales books and more advanced technical know-how. However, the new plane could win sales in Russia and some eastern European and Asian countries, industry analysts said, with buyers attracted by its lower running costs. Irkut said operational costs for its new plane would be up to 15 percent cheaper than current generation aircraft. With a range of up to 6,000km, the MS-21 would be competing against the Boeing 737 and Airbus A320 aircraft which dominate the medium-range narrow-body market. Both companies have upgraded those families to achieve comparable 15 percent operational savings compared with previous versions. 1 2 NEXT › This story has been viewed 987 times.

This new method enables the integration of electrical, optical and structural component during the build process. A component 3D printed using the THREAD process. Photo courtesy of AMRC. Based out of the University of Sheffield and working with aircraft manufacturing company Boeing, AMRC says this new patent-pending process will allow for parts to be additively manufactured with built-in, continuous connectivity and functionalities. Currently, the fully automated THREAD processes has been successfully demonstrated on polymer 3D printing machines. However, AMRC believes THREAD can be applied to a wide range of AM platforms. “THREAD has scope to simultaneously add multiple industry-recognised threads of differing materials into one component, giving the component additional functions,” explains AMRC Development Engineer and AM specialist Mark Cocking. “This will open AM up to a greater variety of uses.” Cocking adds that this development is significant in the fact that is crosses into so many different industries and has the ability to revolutionize the medical, aerospace and automotive sectors. THREAD will be an advantage in the manufacture of components requiring encapsulated electronics. This new 3D printing process can be developed as an add-on technology for existing AM platforms and also incorporated into next generation AM technologies. “We see THREAD transforming the functionality of additively manufactured components,” says Chris Iveson, who is driving the commercialisation of the technology. “Feedback from our contacts in various industries indicates a real need for this capability, with new potential applications being discussed daily. This is a great example of the AMRC using its unique expertise to solve real industry problems.” The AMRC with Boeing is continually developing THREAD technology for various markets. www.amrc.co.uk Share Tweet Facebook LinkedIn Google+ Tags 3D printing AMRC Boeing THREAD Related 3M develops new technology for 3D printing polymers Boeing awards OPM with 3D printing contract for Starliner spacecraft Researchers develop the world’s largest solid 3D printed tool for aircraft manufacturing Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

Published: 14:55 May 29, 2017 Reuters   SMALL MEDIUM LARGE Moscow: Russia carried out the maiden flight of its new MS-21 medium-range passenger plane on Sunday, its first post-Soviet foray into production of a mainline commercial aircraft which it hopes will rival those of its Western competitors. In a surprise statement, manufacturer Irkut Corporation and its state-controlled parent company United Aircraft Corporation (UAC) said an MS-21-300 model had successfully completed a 30-minute flight at a height of 1,000 metres and travelling at 300km an hour. Squeezed by Western sanctions over its role in the Ukraine crisis, Russia is trying to rejuvenate domestic industrial production to make the country less dependant on foreign firms. The test flight, which was not announced to media beforehand, comes just three weeks after China staged the maiden flight of its new C919 passenger jet, highlighting the growing competition to industry heavyweights Boeing and Airbus. Russian officials have said the MS-21 is superior to its Western-made counterparts in many respects and will be snapped up by both Russian and foreign carriers, but Western analysts say both Russia and China face a huge challenge to shatter the transatlantic aeroplane duopoly. “The flight mission has been completed. The flight was fine, there were no observations which will prevent further testing,” test pilot Oleg Kononenko was quoted as saying. Western aviation sources however expressed surprise at the flight’s brevity and relatively low altitude compared with recent 3-4 hour debuts of North American and European models. “It suggests they either have severe limitations or may have had something happen and decided to come back,” said a Western flight test engineer, speaking on condition of anonymity. A Western jetmaking source called it a “genteel flight”. A UAC spokesman said the flight had been long enough to test everything that needed checking in the air. Russia has fought hard to shake off its Soviet reputation for old and creaking aircraft flown by inexperienced crews. Flag carrier Aeroflot last year earned its fourth star from independent ratings website Skytrax, ranking it alongside major European and Middle Eastern competitors and ahead of big US carriers such as Delta and United. President Vladimir Putin called Irkut General Director Oleg Demchenko to congratulate him and his employees with what the Kremlin called “a significant event”. The twin-engined MS-21 will be built in two variants: the MS-21-300 which will have 160-211 seats, and the later MS-21-200 which will have 130-165 seats. It is sometimes referred to as the MC-21 when using the Russian name and Cyrillic letters.

BOX — Airbus Helicopters starts construction of assembly line in China PARIS: Airbus Helicopters, the world’s largest supplier of commercial helicopters, has started building an assembly line in China in what Europe’s largest aerospace group said was a key step in its plans to tap into the Chinese market. The company’s final assembly line will be located in Qingdao, eastern China, with construction expected to be completed by 2018. An Airbus framework agreement signed in 2016 called for 100 H135 helicopters to be assembled over the next 10 years, and the first aircraft roll-out from Qingdao is planned for mid-2019. Guillaume Faury, chief executive of Airbus Helicopters, said in a statement that the start of construction demonstrated the company’s “commitment to further enhancing our industrial cooperation with China’s rapidly growing aviation industry”. -Reuters More from Aviation Tests MS-21 medium-range passenger plane 7.6m passengers use Dubai International in April Emirates appoints Emiratis to management roles Emirates names 3 Emiratis to key posts Chaos continues as BA battles IT meltdown Alitalia strike grounds 200 flights British Airways hopes to resume most flights BA cancels flights from Heathrow, Gatwick filed underGulfNewsBusinessAviation Also In Aviation7.6m passengers use Dubai International in April Business Gallery Doors open to a three-day super sale Mohammad launches Marsa Al Arab project Business Videos PlayAbu Dhabi Ship Building enjoys growing success Strata UAE leads aerospace manufacturing FOLLOW US Most Popular ViewedCommentedGalleriesVideos 01Tests MS-21 medium-range passenger plane 02Emirates appoints Emiratis to management roles 03Etihad's new plane has 'apartments, studios' 04Emirates names 3 Emiratis to key posts 057.6m passengers use Dubai International in April 13Images Mohammad launches Marsa Al Arab project May 15, 2017 8Images Dubai’s next big mall gets into project mode Mar 16, 2017 8Images Pictures: Apple Store in Abu Dhabi Oct 27, 2015 2Images China’s home-grown C919 passenger jet takes off May 05, 2017 Play Abu Dhabi Ship Building enjoys growing success Nov 24, 2016 Play Strata UAE leads aerospace manufacturing Oct 25, 2016 Play Emirates opens SkyPharma in Dubai Sep 18, 2016 Play Video: Electronics fiesta as Gitex opens Oct 01, 2016 Explore the UAE Find the right airport Currency Converter first-currency currencyAEDDinarRupee= first-currency currencyINRDinarRupee Most Popular on Gulf News Our patience has limits, says UAE minister Viral video girl performs for Shaikh Mohammad 6 traffic accidents on first day of Ramadan Indian grandma in UAE sets world record Traffic chaos as car catches fire in Dubai Canada woos visitors, skilled workers UAE petrol prices cheaper in June 9 best superfoods to have at suhoor How to maximise nutrition this Ramadan Close Recommended For You Fear as Philippine Muslim city burnsPUBLISHED ON May 30, 2017 Feedback Get The Paper Our Apps Mobile friendly version Our location Advanced Search Sitemap MY GULF NEWS GulfNews.com is the most widely read newspaper, and online site in English in the Middle East.

Made for Qantas Airways in 1964, the “Saturday Night Fever” heartthrob and qualified pilot acquired the jet when Australia’s national carrier retired it more than 30 years later. “It gives me great pleasure to make this exciting historical announcement that my beloved Boeing 707 aircraft has been donated to the Historical Aircraft Restoration society (HARS),” Travolta, a Qantas ambassador since 2002, said in a statement. (FILES) A file photo taken on July 12, 2002, shows Hollywood star and Qantas “Ambassador-at-Large” John Travolta, standing in front of his Boeing 707 at Sydney Airport./ AFP PHOTO / Greg Wood Australian aircraft preservation organisation HARS will help restore the plane so it can make the journey from the United States to their base some 90 miles (145 kilometres) from Sydney. A date for the flight is not yet fixed but the actor, a long-time aviation buff, said he plans to be on it. “The aircraft currently requires a lot of work to be restored to a safe flying state and having seen first hand the dedication and passion of people at HARS, I have no doubt this beautiful and historical aircraft will be flying again,” Travolta said. “I am hoping to be part of the crew to fly the aircraft to Australia.” HARS President Bob De La Hunty said the idea was first floated when he met Travolta in 2009 and the pair flew a Qantas 1955 Super Constellation aircraft along Australia’s east coast. “We share a mutual respect for old airplanes and flying and at that stage we were keen to suggest to him that if he ever wanted to part with his Boeing 707 we would be very interested in it,” De La Hunty told broadcaster ABC. “When we heard earlier this year that he was looking at possibly not continuing with his Boeing 707, we made contact. He jumped at the idea and so we’ve been in detailed discussions and negotiations since.” Boeing 707s dominated passenger aircraft in the 1960s, helping usher in an era of long-range travel which had previously been dominated by rail and sea.

Lt. Col. Robert Vaucher and Joe Wing both served on B-29s during the war. The airplane will land at noon accompanied by other World War II airplanes, including a C-45 Expeditor, T-6 Texan and a collection of World War II aircraft from the local Commemorative Air Force Delaware Valley Wing based at Princeton Airport. Vaucher, a decorated World War II veteran, was a B-29 aircraft commander. He piloted the first B-29 Superfortress accepted from Boeing by the U.S. Army Air Corp, delivering it to the U.S. Air Corp 40th Bomb Group in Pratt, Kansas. He also flew the first B-29 strategic combat mission over mainland Japan on June 15, 1944, and also the longest B-29 mission - 4,030 miles round trip - from India to Sumatra on Aug. 10, 1944. Wing served as a gunner and back up flight engineer on B-29s during World War II flying over 30 missions from Tinian to Japan. One of his last missions was flying with the Enola Gay the day the atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima. The B-29, Fifi, is one of only two remaining airworthy B-29s in the world and is the only one that is flown regularly. The aircraft will remain at the airport on Tuesday and Wednesday, and tours of the aircraft are available for $10 for adults and $5 for children ages 11 to 17. Those under 11 can see inside the aircraft at no charge. Fees for flights range from $80 to $1,595 and reservations may be made at online.

According to Izvestia, Moscow hopes that the talks will open a new page in bilateral relations, which hit the skids during Francois Hollande’s term as president. French experts told the newspaper that Macron is also interested in contacting the Russian leader, since this will allow him to demonstrate that his foreign policy is independent.

Despite all that sharp rhetoric, the new French president invariably stressed that dialogue with Moscow is essential. Macron’s headquarters refrained from commenting on the upcoming talks to Izvestia, preferring "to wait for the results." According to French experts, the meeting with Putin will help Macron prove himself as an independent head of state. "The upcoming meeting is more important for Macron than for Putin. The new French leader has a crucial aim - to show that he is a strong president, and he really has the opportunity to demonstrate that he is not a puppet of Angela Merkel," French analyst, one of the founders of Stratpol analytical portal Xavier Moreau told Izvestia. An expert of the French Institute for International and Strategic Affairs (IRIS) told Izvestia "The anti-Russian and pro-NATO lobby is extremely strong in the French establishment," noting that by welcoming Putin, Macron will be displaying political willpower and courage. The Russian Ambassador to France Alexander Orlov was optimistic about the possibility of a warming in the countries’ bilateral relations. He noted that with the rise of a bright and competent president to power in France, Moscow and Paris have hopes for friendlier ties. In addition, expectations are in the air that the new leader of France will show more independence than former President Hollande.   Kommersant: Top Russian officials take off for Egypt to bolster strategic alliance Russia’s top diplomat and defense chief are heading to Egypt to meet their counterparts in a 2+2 format meeting set to be held in Cairo. The event will focus on bilateral issues, such as new weapons deals and the restoration of air travel, as well as the numerous regional problems, namely terrorist attacks against Christians in Egypt, chaos plaguing neighboring Libya, the ongoing wars in Syria and Yemen, and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, Kommersant wrote. This is the third meeting between the ministers in the 2+2 format. According to Kommersant’s diplomatic source in Moscow, the parties will discuss "the possibility of prolonging or re-signing the agreement for a strategic partnership between Russia and Egypt, which was signed in 2009 (for 10 years) by then-presidents Dmitry Medvedev and Hosni Mubarak." Read also Putin highlights Russia’s solid ties with Egypt According to a source from the Russian Ministry of Defense, another topic on the agenda is implementing a package of contracts for around $3.5 bln, signed in 2014, which include deliveries of Russian air defense systems to Cairo, as well as artillery, small arms, and aviation. The issue can be considered settled, the newspaper’s source in the military-technical cooperation project said, adding that all that is left is to "agree on the price." According to Kommersant's diplomatic source in Moscow, during the talks "the ministers will certainly discuss the deadlocked topic of resuming air travel between the two countries, although this is not an essential matter for Lavrov and Shoigu." The situation in Libya will also be a major topic for discussion. "In the international arena, Moscow and Cairo are increasingly acting as partners, and in some cases as situational allies," the newspaper wrote, so talks on the conflict in Yemen, the Palestinian-Israeli settlement and the war in Syria are also to be expected. According to a Kommersant source in the Russian Defense Ministry, Sergey Shoigu is going to talk in detail about the four zones of de-escalation created in Syria with the help of Russia, Iran and Turkey. Earlier, Moscow believed that the Egyptian military could participate in protecting these zones. The Russian diplomatic source told Kommersant that this issue is still relevant.   Vedomosti: Russia’s MC-21 to challenge Boeing, Airbus as maiden flight is major success Russia’s MC-21-300 aircraft completed a successful maiden flight on May 28, after the event had been postponed several times. According to Vedomosti, the MC-21 will have to compete not only with Airbus and Boeing, but also with China’s C919 aircraft. The MC-21 is an airliner in the most popular segment of narrow-body civilian aircraft, dominated by Airbus and Boeing. According to its developer, Irkut (part of United Aircraft Corporation), deliveries of the MC-21 will begin once it receives its certificate in 2019. A federal official told the newspaper, it was planned to roll out 900-1,000 aircraft in total, with up to two-thirds earmarked for export.

Orders for 312 aircraft have already been received. "The first flight is a beginning for flight tests, which will demonstrate whether the announced characteristics live up to expectations. If it fails, then the program will have problems. However, a composite wing and good aerodynamics offer reasons to expect success,” Infomost Consulting CEO Boris Rybak told Vedomosti. According to the newspaper, the MC-21 will have to compete not only with Airbus and Boeing, but also with Chinese C919. Both countries are targeting roughly the same export markets, vying for third after Airbus and Boeing in developing countries due to state support of sales and political arrangements, a source close to United Aircraft Corporation told the newspaper, adding that China might have more political weight and money. Fyodor Borisov from Institute for Transport Economics at the Higher School of Economics told Vedomosti, that China still lags significantly behind Russia in the aircraft industry, although the gap is rapidly narrowing. According to the expert, the C919 will be widely popular outside of China and its satellite countries. Nezavisimaya Gazeta: Labor shortage fears being stoked to raise retirement age The latest concern topping President Putin’s economic agenda is the country’s labor shortage. The team of Alexey Kudrin, Head of the Center for Strategic Research, and ex-Finance Minister, will present his economic strategy to the president before the end of May. While the supporters of raising the retirement age are currently in the majority, in reality the labor shortage problem can transpire only if labor policy does not boost productivity, upgrade production or improve economic efficiency, the newspaper wrote. According to a new forecast by the Economic Development Ministry, from 2016 to 2020, the number of the working-age Russians (men aged 16-59, women - 16-54) will diminish by about 3 mln people. According to the newspaper, this is not the first time the ministry has warned about a negative demographic trend. However, right now “this topic is becoming crucial to the country’s strategy that faces the task of modernizing production, introducing new technologies, and increasing efficiency.” Read also Russia may increase retirement age in 6-18 years — ex-finance minister Russian government has not made decision on retirement age hike — minister IMF recommends to reexamine retirement age in Russia to keep pension payments strong Russia's economy ministry: raising retirement age is global trend Russian Economic Development Ministry supports raising retirement age to 63-65 “Demographic ‘fearmongering’ help justify unpopular economic decisions. The population in Russia is aging, the number of employees is decreasing, so people need to tighten their belts, and pension payouts to the older generation need to be put off - this logic can be found in a new strategy put together by Alexey Kudrin’s team. The Ministry of Finance tends to agree with it,” Nezavisimaya Gazeta wrote. The experts interviewed by the newspaper believe that the impending labor shortage is overblown. Official unemployment in Russia is slowly declining. And given the current pace, the number of jobless in Russia will drop from 4.2 mln people (on average per month) in 2016, to 3.7 mln people by 2020, Professor of Labor and Social Policy Department of the Academy of National Economy and Public Administration Alexander Shcherbakov told Nezavisimaya Gazeta. "Unemployment is the classic, foremost reserve of manpower," he told the newspaper. "I think that as far as Russia's labor market is concerned, with proper regulation, the shortage of workers will not be a significant threat by 2020," the expert added. Talks about a dearth in the working-age population is another ploy to justify raising the retirement age, Solid Management analyst Sergei Zvenigorodsky told the newspaper, adding that raising the retirement age might be dangerous as it could lead to a decrease in the overall level of wages, and in unemployment.   Izvestia: IT watchdog to outline restrictions on video content for websites with Russian audience Russia’s Internet watchdog is laying out a set of rules for thwarting viewers for online theaters. Those who have more than 100,000 visitors from Russia per day will have to introduce additional restrictions on video content and ensure age-related rating of the content, Izvestia wrote citing the draft law. The law on online cinemas will come into force in Russia on July 1. It will concern audiovisual services, visited by more than 100,000 users per day in Russia and prohibits screening videos that justify extremism, contain pornography, obscene language, and the like, without the age-restricting ratings. Read also Presidential aide says Russia’s law on online movie theaters won’t affect YouTube Until recently, the watchdog did not set out any guidelines to count website traffic - now, a user would have to watch a video for at least 15 seconds or just stay on a webpage to be considered a “visitor”. According to Tvzavr CEO, Marina Surigina, online cinemas have many different ‘counters’ that enable it to analyze users’ behavior and to tally them up. “We do not care what counter we will be asked to use, it only needs to be free and easy to install,” she added. “Of course, I would like the watchdog to choose one that has already been installed by almost everybody (for example, Mediascope) or some kind of free analogue. We do not want to pay for additional counters, which we do not really need,” she told the newspaper. According to J'son & Partners Consulting, in 2016 the volume of the Russian market for legitimate video services reached 11.18 bln rubles ($196.76 mln), which is 32% more than in 2015. According to the company's estimates, by 2020 the revenues of legal video services in Russia will increase to about 20 bln rubles ($352.01 mln).   TASS is not responsible for the material quoted in the press reviews {{item.group_date}} {{item.suffix?", "+item.suffix:""}} Show more Share Top News May 29, 19:00 Putin-Macron first meeting round-up May 29, 19:00 May 29, 20:11 Macron lashes out at Russian news agency Sputnik, RT channel over campaign coverage May 29, 20:11 May 29, 20:56 Moscow mayor says Monday's hurricane in Moscow 'unprecedented' May 29, 20:56 May 29, 19:18 Hollywood director highlights his esteem for Russia’s president May 29, 19:18 In other media Реклама Photo 9 Results of Vladimir Putin's visit to Serbia 11 38th mission to the International Space Station over, cosmonauts back to earth 10 Wolf, Lynx and Tiger: Russian military vehicles Infographics Russia's gas pipelines to Europe by 2018 Russia’s state defense order in 2015 Chinese Lunar Exploration Program Russia’s Angara A5 heavy-load space carrier rocket Most read Now Today This week 1 Putin-Macron first meeting round-up 2 Hurricane death toll rises to 14 in Moscow, Moscow Region 3 Moscow mayor says Monday's hurricane in Moscow 'unprecedented' 4 Hollywood director highlights his esteem for Russia’s president 5 Russia to respond to diplomats’ expulsion from Estonia on tit-for-tat basis 6 Lavrov hopes those responsible for Libyan crisis would eventually regret it 7 Russia may start wheat exports to Venezuela in early 2017 1 Moscow mayor says Monday's hurricane in Moscow 'unprecedented' 2 Putin-Macron first meeting round-up 3 Russia’s Eastern Military District receives new shipment of Terminator helicopters 4 Russia condemns North Korea’s new missile test 5 Hollywood director highlights his esteem for Russia’s president 6 Putin arrives in France for first meeting with Macron 7 Putin and Macron hold their first meeting in Versailles 1 Russian 'soldier of the future' combat gear tested in Syria 2 'We are wide awake’ — Russian defense chief on US threat from space 3 Putin decorates commandoes for two-day face-to-face clash with militants in Syria 4 Putin meets with visiting Philippine leader 5 Moscow mayor says Monday's hurricane in Moscow 'unprecedented' 6 Islamic State claims responsibility for Manchester terror attack 7 MC-21 airliner makes first test flight — source TOP STORIES CONFLICT IN SYRIA RUSSIA'S DEFENSE INDUSTRY OIL& GAS INDUSTRY SPACE PROGRAMS Реклама News Russian Politics & Diplomacy World Business & Economy Military & Defense Science & Space Society & Culture Sport Press Review Sections Tags Media Press Releases Infographics About us TASS TODAY AGENCY NEWS TASS HISTORY MANAGEMENT CONTACTS Services TASS-PHOTO TASS-ONLINE TASS Beta-version.

SYDNEY: Hollywood star John Travolta has donated his “beloved” Boeing 707 plane to an Australian aviation museum and is aiming to be part of the crew to deliver the vintage aircraft. Made for Qantas Airways in 1964, the “Saturday Night Fever” heartthrob and qualified pilot acquired the jet when Australia’s national carrier retired it more than 30 years later. “It gives me great pleasure to make this exciting historical announcement that my beloved Boeing 707 aircraft has been donated to the Historical Aircraft Restoration society (HARS),” Travolta, a Qantas ambassador since 2002, said in a statement. Australian aircraft preservation organisation HARS will help restore the plane so it can make the journey from the United States to their base some 90 miles (145 kilometres) from Sydney. A date for the flight is not yet fixed but the actor, a long-time aviation buff, said he plans to be on it. “The aircraft currently requires a lot of work to be restored to a safe flying state and having seen first hand the dedication and passion of people at HARS, I have no doubt this beautiful and historical aircraft will be flying again,” Travolta said. “I am hoping to be part of the crew to fly the aircraft to Australia.” HARS President Bob De La Hunty said the idea was first floated when he met Travolta in 2009 and the pair flew a Qantas 1955 Super Constellation aircraft along Australia’s east coast. “We share a mutual respect for old airplanes and flying and at that stage we were keen to suggest to him that if he ever wanted to part with his Boeing 707 we would be very interested in it,” De La Hunty told broadcaster ABC. “When we heard earlier this year that he was looking at possibly not continuing with his Boeing 707, we made contact. He jumped at the idea and so we’ve been in detailed discussions and negotiations since.” Boeing 707s dominated passenger aircraft in the 1960s, helping usher in an era of long-range travel which had previously been dominated by rail and sea.

Irkut Corporation is a Russian aircraft manufacturer and member of the United Aircraft Corporation. The duration of the flight was 30 minutes at the altitude of 1000 m, at the speed of 300 km/hour, said a statement from the company. The flight plan included checking of in-flight stability and controllability, and also the controllability of the power plant, it said. According to the programme, during the flight a simulated landing approach was performed, followed by a flight over the runway, climbing and turning. This technique is typical for the maiden flight of new types of aircraft, it added. The new aircraft is Russia's first post-Soviet foray into production of a mainline commercial aircraft which it hopes will rival those of its Western competitors usch as Boeing and Airbus. The test flight comes just three weeks after China staged the maiden flight of its new C919 passenger jet, highlighting the growing competition to industry heavyweights Boeing and Airbus, said a Reuters report. Russian officials have said the MS-21 is superior to its Western-made counterparts in many respects, but Western analysts say both Russia and China face a huge challenge to shatter the transatlantic airplane duopoly, Reuters added. The MC-21-300 aircraft was piloted by the crew commander Oleg Kononenko and copilot Roman Taskayev. Kononenko said: “Flight mission is accomplished. The flight went in the normal mode. There are no obstacles revealed preventing the tests continuation.” Roman Taskayev said: “Characteristics and operational modes of the power plant are confirmed, all aircraft systems operated without glitches.” Oleg Demchenko, president of Irkut Corporation, said: “Today is the historic day for our personnel and the whole big team, which works on creation of MC-21 aircraft.” “We put the most advanced technical solutions in our aircraft, to provide enhanced comfort for passengers and attractive economic characteristics for air carriers,” he said. “I am happy to declare the maiden flight of the MC-21 aircraft has been successfully accomplished. I congratulate all project participants on our common holiday,” he added. Yury Slyusar, president of United Aircraft Corporation (UAC), said: “MC-21 is created in a wide cooperation, where together with Irkut, other enterprises of the UAC are actively participating, namely Aerocomposite company, Ulyanovsk and Voronezh aircraft plants, UAC Integration Centre in Moscow.” “This is an important stage in the formation of the new UAC industrial model. According to our estimates, the global demand in the MC-21 segment will be about 15,000 new aircraft in the next 20 years. I'm sure the airlines will appreciate our new aircraft,” he added. – TradeArabia News Service Tags: | Russia | aircraft | flight | maiden | Irkut | More Industry, Logistics & Shipping Stories Grohe names new Middle East, Africa president UAE to start control of hazardous materials in e-devices Egypt’s El Dabaa NPP to install latest reactors Focus on value added products, aluminium firms told Alba concludes Line 6 FEED study Steelcase wins ‘Best Commercial Product Design’ award Sadafco to distribute $34.6m in dividends Automechanika, Italy’s AICA plan to collaborate Hyundai looks to increase presence in Iran UAE's total battery trade hits $1.42 billion Alba chairman visits Line 5, Line 6 Expansion site Bahrain's imports reach $999.6m in April Honeywell joins top firms in delivering preferable refrigerants TP-Link urges channel partners to develop domain expertise Majid Al Futtaim starts work on giant Carrefour facility in Dubai Etihad Cargo helps transport endangered black rhinos China industrial firms' profits hit $83bn in April Dubai’s RTA Call Centre gets record calls in Q1 Agility reaches global settlement in US supply contract row Dubai Airport Freezone nets solid Q1 sales growth ArcelorMittal JV top bidder for Italian steel giant Adnoc, OMV ink downstream projects cooperation deal Toshiba Tec unveils hybrid MFP 350 US aerospace, defence firms to take part in Paris Air Show Alba makes solid progress on Line 6 expansion project Daikin launches premium air cooled chillers GreenMantra develops new synthetic polypropylene waxes Rockwell Automation CEO discusses future of IoT Aramex recognised at Frost & Sullivan’s awards Julphar reports sales worth $100m in Q1 Calendar of Events View all events Tools Exchange Rates Weather Forecast BBC World Service Ads Sectors | Information | About Us | Construction & Real Estate Energy, Oil & Gas Finance & Capital Market Industry & Logistics IT & Telecommunication Health & Environment Motoring Retail & Wholesale Travel, Tourism & Hospitality Government & Laws Media & Promotion Back to top Trade News Newsletter Events Business Directory TradeArabia Network Advertising Contact Feedback Privacy Statement Terms of Service Web Feeds

Right now it’s only a press release and a few concept images, but it looks like this is an air-launched system kind of like a Tristar/Pegasus, only much higher and completely unmanned. It’s a ton and a half to low earth orbit, with a goal of 10 flights in 10 days. Up in Albany? There’s a new hacker con happening in a few weeks. Anycon is a hacking, infosec, and cyber security conference happening June 16 & 17th in Albany, NY. The organizers of this con ([Chris], and his company Leet Cybersecurity) are loosely modeling this con after Derbycon. [Dave Kennedy] of TrustedSec will be attending as the keynote speaker. GOOD NEWS! [Casey Neistat] is under investigation by the FAA. [Casey Neistat] is the YouTuber that flies drones right in the middle of the Hudson River corridor, and is a menace to general aviation around NYC. This is neat. The Supplyframe Design Lab is the Hackaday Mothership right in the middle of Pasadena where we host our designers in residence, host a few meetups, and slowly fill every cubic inch of space with either dust or tools. The Design Lab just won a design award. You can check out the ‘design’ part of the Design Lab here, but keep in mind it will never be that clean ever again. Here’s an interesting Twitter to follow. Alitronik is a curator of the weird and wonderful cheap crap that can be found on AliExpress. Need an Altera Cyclone dev board? Here you go. A desk-mountable OLED inspection microscope? Done. A seven dollar Tesla coil? Dude, you can totally fit this inside a hat. [Drygol] had a nice old Commodore C16 with a broken TED chip. A shame, really. He did what anyone would do: put a C64 motherboard in the case for a fancy stealth upgrade. Is the great crowdfunded 3D printer boom over? Some would say that ship sailed after dozens of 3D printer crowdfunding projects failed to deliver, or delivered very low-quality machines. These people were wrong. This Polaroid-branded 3D printing pen might not get funding. A year ago, this project would have been funded on day one. There would have been writeups in The Verge on how Polaroid is turning the corner after decades of wasted opportunities. Now, the Crowdfunded 3D printer boom is finally over. The Hackaday crew was at the Bay Area Maker Faire last weekend and holy crap did we have a blast. Everyone came to the meetup on Saturday except for the fire marshall. The secret OSHPark bringahack on Sunday was even more impressive. We also saw a Donkey Car capable of driving around a track autonomously, but the team behind it didn’t have their work up on the Internet at the time.

Do you even have a valid point? The included chart you post shows it is legal. Sounds more to me like you are a jealous piece of crap and have already lost. Report comment Reply Silis says: May 28, 2017 at 5:45 pm The links shows that light aircraft are actively using the area, therefore making flying quad copters there a dangerous thing. Although we should note that it does not matter what argument you make, as calling someone a ‘jealous piece of crap’ disqualifies you from a discussion instantly.

Report comment Reply Greenaum says: May 29, 2017 at 7:56 am For the music alone, I’d give him The Chair. Polaroid is a dead, virtual brand, has been for a decade or more. They were hit quite badly by the complete obsolescence of chemical-based photography. Now you can get a few Chinese megafactory-made TVs with Polaroid’s name on them. Next week it’ll be a caffeinated fruit juice. Nobody cares. If Polaroid aren’t making instant film cameras, it isn’t Polaroid, and nobody wants an instant film camera anyway.

Oooh, next episode is some guy jumping on to 3,000 tomatoes while smashing a new Samsung television and then a half hour reaction to it – can’t wait. Wheeeeee modern humanity!!! Report comment Reply Jimmy_Pop says: May 28, 2017 at 10:30 pm That summarises my feels very well. I’d punch in the face like 90% of Youtubers. That’s the new curse: “may your children become youtubers” Report comment Reply Greenaum says: May 29, 2017 at 8:02 am Actually the face-punching thing is one Youtube channel I’d watch. Since they’re all desperate, cheap whores, they’d probably let you do it for a hundred dollars. Line the fuckers up, stupid, vacant, ugly mugs, one after another, spouting their vapid ideas and their complete ignorance of basically everything. Then we get somebody sensible to come in, perhaps wearing a mortar board, academic gown, and boxing gloves. He beats their stupid, uncomprehending, still smiling faces to a pulp, to a 10-second loop of Sandstorm by Darude. I’d actually enjoy watching that. Next week, we take petrol bombs round the bedrooms / garages / “recording studios” of all the idiots who’ve decided that reinventing traditional network TV channels, ON YOUTUBE, is going to make their millions. Then after that, it’s a visit to Hell, to see those special souls who use utterly misleading thumbnails and descriptions for their banal videos of still photographs with narration over them.

Risk of an incident is non-zero, hence that no incident has happened yet is entirely moot, all we have to do is wait, he’s using airspace that is rich with potential incidents. Even if you never get your feet off the ground, the ground is where a disaster ends up, and a major city is a crowded place. Want that on your head? Complaining to “Dude” is the wrong place… it’s Neistat that’s taken possession of the risk that threatens to end with much more strict regulations imposed on us. If you wish to dispute still… simply prove the risk is actually zero. Report comment Reply Brian Benchoff says: May 29, 2017 at 6:12 pm ^ This shit right here.

Report comment Reply Greenaum says: May 29, 2017 at 8:12 am The risk is a drone getting sucked into a jet intake, or smashing a smaller plane’s windscreen, or some other important part, possibly causing a crash. Of course birds can do the same, but we can’t actually do anything to legislate against birds. They just don’t pay any attention, the avian scofflaws. Perhaps if sentences were harsher… Anyway… Drones contain harder parts than birds, and they don’t test engines for drone-strike. Since drones are man-made things, it’s better to keep them out of the way altogether. It would be stupid to wait for an accident to happen, when prevention is easy, and all that we’re losing is a bit of airspace for hobbyists. When human lives are one the line, it’s a fair trade.

Report comment Reply Erin says: May 29, 2017 at 12:33 pm The Tristar/Pegasus comparison for XS-1 and its payload seems wrong. The XS-1 is intended to be a proper first stage, doing proper first stage work, just like Falcon 9’s first stage. Get S2 up above the atmosphere and moving reasonably quickly so it can insert into orbit. Also like the Falcon 9 first stage, the XS-1 is intended to be reusable. It just makes an aerodynamic landing instead of a propulsive one. I don’t think this is picking nits. Launcher aircraft have their place–even though I don’t think we’ve practically applied it yet (it’s not a huge energy/drag gain, but it does let you move the noise/violence of launch to a less-contested space)–but a first stage is more than a launcher aircraft, and a reusable first stage even more so. A combination of the two would be quite something, as well, and I think that’s what the Brits are after with Skylon…if they can ever pull it off… Report comment Reply Leave a Reply Cancel reply Enter your comment here...

SNOHOMISH — With two fist pumps and a “C’mon!,” Kevin Beavers wrote his name into the Snohomish County Amateur golf tournament record book. Beavers finished 9-under par to hold off a hard-charging Jacob Rohde and become just the second player ever to three-peat as Snohomish County Amateur champion. Beavers shot a 4-under 68 in Monday’s final round at Snohomish Golf Course, finishing with a 54-hole score of 207 and joining Bob Burton (1973-75) as the only individuals to win three straight times in the County Am’s 87-year history. ”It feels really good,” said Beavers, who dedicated the victory to his fiancee, Hanh Tran, who he got engaged to eight months ago. “I put a lot of work into my game the last few years. I didn’t swing my best these last couple days, but I putted really well. My heart was pumping pretty hard out there, but I managed myself really well, and that’s something I’ve been working on, so I’m very proud of myself for that.” Beavers, a 33-year-old Boeing engineer who lives in Seattle, finished two strokes ahead of Rohde, who shot the low round of the day at 66 to finish at 7-under. Rohde, playing in the group ahead of Beavers, pulled within one stroke through 16 holes. But Beavers overcame an errant tee shot on 18 to finish with a birdie and secure what ended up being a wire-to-wire victory. ”I knew last night going to bed that, with the way Kevin’s been playing, that 69 was likely for him,” said Rohde, a 39-year-old landscape architect from Everett who finished second for the second straight year. “So I thought I needed to shoot 64 to have a chance. I did my best and just came up short. But I tried hard, and the greens were really tough today for putting. Had I gotten a couple more putts to go it could have been good.” Ethan Casto, a 20-year-old from Snohomish and a freshman at Western Washington University, finished third at 4-under. Casto, who came into the final round one stroke behind Beavers in second place, shot an even-par 72. For a while it looked as though Beavers would run away and hide with the trophy. Beavers played flawless golf through 11 holes, making five birdies to reach 10-under. He was all over the flag with his approach shot at the par-4 second before making a 5-foot birdie putt, he drained a 20-foot birdie putt at the par-3 fifth, then he sank a 7-foot birdie putt at the par-4 sixth. After birdieing the first two holes of the back nine he was seven strokes ahead of his playing partner Casto, and even though Rohde finished 3-under over the front nine it seemed immaterial. But Beavers made his first slip at the par-4 13th when he three-putted from 35 feet for his first bogey of the day. Another bogey on the par-4 16th after he drove into the trees, combined with Rohde’s birdie on the par-4 15th, suddenly saw Beavers’ lead shrink to one. But Beavers, taking deep breaths before each of his shots, regained his composure on the par-4 17th, sinking a 5-foot putt to save par. ”Nothing was going wrong on the front side,” Beavers said. “Then I started hitting some squirrely shots on the back nine, which started making me a little nervous. When I heard Rohde was 6-under (for the day), I told myself on 18 I’ve got to make 4.” That would be the par-5 18th. Rohde, needing a birdie, hit a long drive to give himself a chance to go at the green in two. Rohde’s second shot was slightly to the right, landing in a green-side bunker. His bunker shot came up short, and he two-putted from 25 feet to finish with a par. ”I hit a great drive,” said Rohde, who finished with six birdies and no bogeys. “My second shot, I leaked it a little right into the bunker, and when I got into that bunker it was really thin, there wasn’t a lot of sand. So in my head I was going, ‘Just don’t scull it across the green,’ so I fatted it, unfortunately.” Beavers, unaware of Rohde’s par on 18 and thinking he needed a birdie to ensure victory, pulled his drive left and into the trees. But Beavers was able to punch out to 100 yards, then hit a wedge into the green to 7 feet. With two putts to win, Beavers, after another deep breath, rolled the birdie putt into the cup before reacting with his fist pumps. ”My drive was two feet from going in that really tall stuff, so I got a little lucky there,” Beavers said. “I had a window and I hit a really nice 3-iron out and got myself back in play and hit a really nice wedge in there. You don’t go through 54 holes of golf without getting a little lucky, and that was my break.” Beavers has won the tournament all three times he’s entered. Chris Hatch, a senior at Western Washington University, and Alvin Kwak, a sophomore at Kamiak High School, were the only other players to finish under par for tournament, as the Mukilteo residents tied for fourth at 2-under. Hatch shot a 1-under 71 Monday, Kwak shot an even-par 72.   Kevin Beavers chips on to the green under watchful eyes Monday during the final round of the Snohomish County Amateur golf tournament at Snohomsih Golf Course. Beavers finished 9-under par to become the second player ever to win the tournament three straight years.

The investigative agency today registered three FIRs and a preliminary enquiry (PE) to go into the controversial decisions made by the erstwhile Manmohan Singh government with regard to the two national carriers, including surrender of profitable routes to favour private airlines. The cases have been registered against unidentified officials of Air India, Ministry of Civil Aviation and others under charges of criminal conspiracy, cheating and corruption, CBI spokesperson R K Gaur said. "The cases relate to decisions taken by the the ministry during the tenure of the UPA which caused losses of tens of thousands of crore of rupees to the exchequer," he said. "The allegations relate to purchase of 111 aircraft for national airlines costing about Rs 70,000 crore to benefit foreign aircraft manufacturers. Such a purchase caused an alleged financial loss to the already stressed national carriers," Gaur said about the first FIR. The CAG had in 2011 questioned the rationale behind the government's decision to order 111 airplanes for AI and Indian Airlines--48 from Airbus and 68 from Boeing-- for about Rs 70,000 crore in 2006. Calling the decision a "recipe for disaster", the government auditor had said it should have raised "alarm" in the Ministry of Civil Aviation, Public Investment Board and The Planning Commission. The second case pertains to leasing of a large number of aircraft without due consideration, proper route study and marketing or price strategy, he said. "It was also alleged that the aircraft were leased even while aircraft acquisition programme was going on," he said. The third case involves allegations of surrender of profitable routes and timings of Air India to favour national and international private players which allegedly caused a "huge" loss to the state-run carrier. In its report on the merger of Air India and Indian Airlines, the CAG had called it "ill-timed". Now the CBI will go into various aspects of the merger. The government auditor had said,"The financial case for the merger was not adequately validated prior to the merger." The merger proposal had received the Manmohan Singh cabinet's approval on March 1, 2007. The CBI's action follows the Supreme Court's January 5 direction on a petition filed by the Centre for Public Interest Litigation led by lawyer Prashant Bhushan. CBI sources said "all stakeholders" were under its scanner with regard to the merger of the two state-run airlines. The process for the merger was initiated by the then Civil Aviation Minister Praful Patel of NCP on March 16, 2006. Patel had sought a concept paper on the merger and a presentation was made before the prime minister on March 22 that year. A Group of Ministers (GoM) had later examined the proposal. Indian Airlines officially merged with Air India in April 2007. The current Air India Chairman-cum-Managing Director Ashwani Lohani had recently said the merger was behind Air India's "downfall". Finance Minister Arun Jaitley had on Saturday favoured disinvestment of Air India, saying the airline's market share was just around 14 per cent whereas its debt burden stood at a staggering Rs 50,000 crore.

The cases have been registered against unidentified officials of Air India, Ministry of Civil Aviation and others under charges of criminal conspiracy, cheating and corruption, CBI spokesperson R K Gaur said. "The cases relate to decisions taken by the the ministry during the tenure of the UPA which caused losses of tens of thousands of crore of rupees to the exchequer," he said. "The allegations relate to purchase of 111 aircraft for national airlines costing about Rs 70,000 crore to benefit foreign aircraft manufacturers. Such a purchase caused an alleged financial loss to the already stressed national carriers," Gaur said about the first FIR. The CAG had in 2011 questioned the rationale behind the government's decision to order 111 airplanes for AI and Indian Airlines--48 from Airbus and 68 from Boeing-- for about Rs 70,000 crore in 2006. Calling the decision a "recipe for disaster", the government auditor had said it should have raised "alarm" in the Ministry of Civil Aviation, Public Investment Board and The Planning Commission. The second case pertains to leasing of a large number of aircraft without due consideration, proper route study and marketing or price strategy, he said. "It was also alleged that the aircraft were leased even while aircraft acquisition programme was going on," he said. The third case involves allegations of surrender of profitable routes and timings of Air India to favour national and international private players which allegedly caused a "huge" loss to the state-run carrier. In its report on the merger of Air India and Indian Airlines, the CAG had called it "ill-timed". Now the CBI will go into various aspects of the merger. The government auditor had said,"The financial case for the merger was not adequately validated prior to the merger." The merger proposal had received the Manmohan Singh cabinet's approval on March 1, 2007. The CBI's action follows the Supreme Court's January 5 direction on a petition filed by the Centre for Public Interest Litigation led by lawyer Prashant Bhushan. CBI sources said "all stakeholders" were under its scanner with regard to the merger of the two state-run airlines. The process for the merger was initiated by the then Civil Aviation Minister Praful Patel of NCP on March 16, 2006. Patel had sought a concept paper on the merger and a presentation was made before the prime minister on March 22 that year. A Group of Ministers (GoM) had later examined the proposal. Indian Airlines officially merged with Air India in April 2007. The current Air India Chairman-cum-Managing Director Ashwani Lohani had recently said the merger was behind Air India's "downfall". Finance Minister Arun Jaitley had on Saturday favoured disinvestment of Air India, saying the airline's market share was just around 14 per cent whereas its debt burden stood at a staggering Rs 50,000 crore.

Sectors like pharma, IT and telecom are consolidating but beneficiaries like Banks, FMCG and Infrastructure are extending the bull rally, Vinod Nair Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services, said in an exclusive interview with Kshitij Anand of Moneycontrol. Transport Corporation of India, Bharat Electronics, Havells India, Ashok Leyland, and Bharat Forge are among top five stocks which can turn out to be multibaggers in next 2-3 years. Q) What is your call on markets right now? It looks like geopolitical concerns and earnings back home are keeping bulls at bay? A) Currently, we have a cautious view due to high valuation, high expectation for FY18 earnings growth and consolidation in the global financial market due to increase in risk. In spite of these concerns, the market is rolling higher into new high due to strong liquidity from MFs and FIIs. Sectors like pharma, IT and telecom are consolidating but beneficiaries like Banks, FMCG and Infrastructure are extending the bull rally. Developed market is hovering with some volatility led by political uncertainty over US President's ability to deliver its reform promises and interference in a federal investigation, but the overall positive trend has been maintained. The domestic market expectation for FY18 is very strong led by exponential earnings growth and benefit from the implementation of GST. The fourth quarter result has been good providing chance of this trend to continue. A case of caution is that market is expecting more than 20 percent earnings growth in FY18 compared to muted FY17 (Bloomberg), creating a risk of a setback in the future. The Sensex is currently valued at a 1-year forward P/E of about 18x. But given strong retail inflows, Mutual Funds are likely to use every dip as an opportunity to invest in equity. In the case of FIIs, the inflows will depend on the next course of action in the US, which is anticipating strong growth in the economy led by next reform and low cost of funds, FOMC has a cautious view regarding the pace of US rate hike, which is positive for EMs. Q) Any top five stocks you think could well turn out to be multibaggers in the next 2-3 years? Transport Corporation of India Implementation of Goods & Services Tax (GST) will be a game changing event for businesses in general and for organised logistics players. It will provide a boost to warehousing, supply chain management and third-party logistic players (3PL) business. Lesser border checks/paperwork would lead to faster movement of trucks; Transit times and cost is expected to shrink by 20-30%. Further, GST will lead to consolidation of warehouses and outsourcing of warehousing services to third party logistic players. Transport Corporation of India Ltd (TCI) will be one of key beneficiary from the implementation of GST given its well-integrated network with a fleet of 9000 trucks, 1400 branch network, manages 5 ships and has warehousing space of 11mn sq ft. Bharat Electronics Bharat Electronics (BEL) has market leadership in defence electronics given its strong execution capabilities, technological tie-ups with a higher focus on R&D. BEL is a debt free & a cash rich company with a strong order book with of Rs 33,806 crore which is 4.7x FY16 sales, providing strong revenue visibility for next 4 years. Further, BEL will be a major beneficiary of GoI higher focus on Make in India and higher indigenous procurement. GoI plans to bring down import dependence to 30% from current 60%. Further, under the new defence procurement policy, a new category called Buy Indian (Indigenously Designed, Developed and Manufactured – IDDM) was introduced, having the highest priority in procurement which will provide higher opportunities for domestic players and improve domestic R&D investments. Havells India Higher than expected GST rate in consumer discretionary may give some impact on volume due to likely price hike post the GST rolled out. However, being a leading player in electrical consumer goods and the recent acquisition of Lloyd consumer business is expected to bring long-term scalability to HAVL’s consumer business. We expect revenue & PAT to grow at healthy 14% & 17% CAGR over FY17-FY19E. Given strong revenue growth and healthy earnings outlook, HAVL is expected to portray a long-term story in the consumer goods segment. Ashok Leyland Ashok Leyland (AL) is the second largest commercial vehicle (CV) manufacturer in India will be direct beneficiary led by improvement in the road infrastructure projects. AL is the largest supplier of logistic vehicles to Indian Army (5% of revenue), will see higher traction from the new defence procurement policy. AL's 100% Acquisition on its 3 JV with Nissan Corporation of the LCV business will give positive impetus for the business and also allow using the Nissan technology on a 1% royalty basis for 5 years. Management is focused on gaining market share in LCV from 15% to 30% over next 2-3 years by launching new models in FY18. We expect the AL's revenue to grow at 14% CAGR over FY17-19E by factoring 12% volume growth in our estimate for the same period. Bharat Forge Bharat Forge (BFL) is planning to scale up the new business from current 5% to 15% in the next 2 to 3 years. The orders from Boeing and new defence JV with AM General will provide higher revenue visibility in the non auto sector during FY18. BFL has also entered into JVs with SAAB, Rafael & IAI (Israel Aircraft Industry) which will boost its presence in the field of air defence. Government mandatory for in-house sourcing for ‘Make in India’ projects will benefit Bharat Forge, in the long run, to build up order book. Upcoming BS6 emission norms can aid a sharp increase in content per vehicle due to increase in the engine components parts in car and Truck segment. We expect 13% revenue CAGR over FY17-19E led by picking in US truck market and de-risking the utilization in Non-auto sector Q) How are you reading RBI’s guidelines on banking sector regarding NPA? Do you think banking sector is trading at frothy valuations? What should investors do? A) The market is anticipating that the proposed NPA resolution will bring a long lasting solution to the country's NPA issue. More leeway will be given to RBI for direct intervention in NPA resolution of banks. This will remove the uncertainty pertaining over the fate of the accumulated NPA in banks book and add more stability to the sector outlook. RBI’s had broadly outlaid the action plan to tackle NPAs issue (released on 22nd may). But, given the wide nature of the report, it failed to provide clarity on the resolution of outstanding NPA. One concern which may be hoarding the market is that how much quantum of haircut banks will have to take to make this resolution effective, leading to some selling pressure on PSU banks. But, Government is moving in the right direction to strengthen the PSU banks space by favouring a merger of weaker small banks into much larger banks. This will strengthen PSU banking with fewer but stronger banks. Larger PSU banks will have significant benefits from synergies and scope of activity. Regarding valuation, we know that it is high compared to historical trend. The current re-rating in valuation is in anticipation of reforms for NPA resolution, the uptrend in business from FY18 and possibility of a reversal in RBI policy stance. Please do note that though the valuation is high it has not reached the all-time high of one year forward P/B. Hence, even if the prices are high but not completely in terms of valuation. Given the encouraging outlook for banking and Indian economy, the valuation can expand further. As a rational investor, we suggest investors be watchful and convert the dip either through external or internal factor as an opportunity to add their exposure in the banking sector. Q) March quarter season has been a mixed bag for D-Street? Do you think the trend will continue and we could see some correction on the back of high expectations of earnings growth? A) We believe that Q4 numbers for the main indexes (like Sensex) way be mixed but for the broad economy, it has been very good. For example, BSE-100 has given a PAT growth of more than 30 percent on a YoY basis led by Metals, Chemicals, Infrastructure and Energy. The fourth quarter has come as a good one on a YoY basis after a gap of about two years. This is providing more weight to the market's expectation of a reversal in earnings growth in FY18. The risk is that currently, the market expects more than 20 percent growth in earnings compared to sub single digit growth in FY17. Implementation of GST can impact the flow of business in the near-term. At the same time, we should also acknowledge the fact that GST will be a big beneficiary to the listed entities in the long-term. The trend of profitability is likely to be maintained in the future unless global factor changes. The question is whether its YoY growth will be as good anticipated by the market or sub below to conclude whether the valuation is high or fair. This question is very difficult to be answered perfectly today, whereas the trend in the long-term is intact but at premium prices. Q) What are your contra buys (sector or stocks) in the year 2017 and why? A) Three sectors which can be considered as a contrary view are: PSU banks PSU banks have not seen a major improvement in asset quality and business growth continued to remain muted in Q4FY17. Concerns prevail over the quantum of haircuts PSUBs will have to absorb in their balance sheet from the proposed NPA resolution policies. If the new framework proves to bring a sustainable solution to the NPA in the Indian banking sector, it could improve the risk profile of PSUBs and result in a re-rating in valuation. Further, PSUBs are transforming into better-disciplined management, while government’s focus on strengthening the PSU banks through mergers and meeting the capital adequacy improves the business outlook in a reviving economic environment. The current valuation and discount to private peers, therefore, provides a favourable risk-reward ratio. Additionally, Government is moving in the right direction to strengthen the PSU banks space by favouring a merger of weaker small banks into much larger banks. The revised PCA (Prompt Corrective Action) regulatory framework is expected to trigger the next phase of consolidation in the PSUB space. There will be fewer, but stronger banks and large PSU banks will benefit from synergies and scope of activity. SBI and Bank of Baroda are our top picks in the space Cement: The industry valuations (1Yr fwd) are at high on the expectation of revival in demand supported by GoI’s enhanced focus on infra and affordable housing. In spite of high valuation, we still have a positive outlook on cement due to the fact that the realisation should see an improvement going forward. Realisations will improve on account of improvement in capacity utilisation as the demand-supply gap is likely to narrow down given the reduced pace of capacity additions over FY17-18E. Further, the cost efficiency initiatives of the companies will fetch the added benefits on profitability. Additionally, the declining trend of interest rates will give a fillip to the housing sector which accounts for ~67% of total cement demand. IT: The IT sector is witnessing a structural change and is planning to recovery from a new framework of business. The current headwinds are a delay in the US new visa immigration policy and lower spending by the international customers. Other headwinds are lower penetration of the Indian IT companies in the emerging digital and artificial intelligence and a stronger rupee. As a remedy, the Indian IT companies are heavily investing in the digital platform, which is currently growing at 30 percent on a YoY basis in revenue as per the latest quarterly result. Indian IT spending is likely to rise from $270B today to $1trllion by 2024. We maintain our contrarian view in the IT space with a long-term view due to its quick adaptability to the new digital business and advantage of lower valuation. Q) The latest minutes from the RBI suggests that instead of a rate cut, the rate hike could be a possibility. Do you agree? If yes, what could be its implication on market? A) The last RBI policy minutes conclude its view as per the then available data and upcoming unknown issue like the future impact of Demonetisation, GST and caution over monsoon and its implication on food inflation. But recent data act like a shot in the arm, retail inflation has collapsed to 3 percent in April compared to 3.8 percent in March. RBI was working on an inflation rate of 4 percent for FY18, the start to the year has been good and the outlook is anticipating further consolidation in retail inflation at least in the near term due to cut in food prices. Economists expect inflation to inch higher to 5 percent by March-2018 due to the reversal of demonetisation effect over the long-term. But, currently, the market is taking it as a positive action in anticipation of good monsoon which will ease inflation further. Additionally, Government is working in such a way that GST rates will further cut the food prices. This has to be factored by RBI and can change its stance from neutral to accommodative in the medium-term. Q) What is your one advice to investors inspired from your guru? A) The market is the true guru of its own which cannot be completely explained by any Voyager due to known and unknown's factor. For example, even after spending years or decade in the equity market experts find it difficult to decide whether we are in a bull or bear market, when did it start or when it will end. Yesterday's defensive capital creates have become today's wealth destroyer or vice versa. In all this unknown’s one thing is for sure, that equity is the best asset with a good return in the long-term. The only way to explore the benefit is to keep it simple and excels in long-term. For passive investors, the best way to benefit from the ever-changing and competitive business world is through equity SIP. While for active retail investors be updated on research outputs and invest in companies which have built and grown their brands with healthy historical parameters. Work with a portfolio method which is not over diversified.To outperform the benchmark you need to identify sectors for which outlook is changing or improving led by demand-supply scenario (domestic or global market), technology changes or regulatory factors. Accordingly, you will have to get in or out of the stocks or sectors. Keeping emotions away from the investment is always advisable. tags #Ashok Leyland #Bharat Electronics #Bharat Forge #Havells India #Stocks Views #Transport Corporation of India #VinodÃ‚Â Nair Related news Business Buy Asian Paints, Hindalco Industries; sell Balrampur Chini: Mitessh Thakkar May 30, 2017 12:04 PM Business Buy Reliance Industries, Colgate Palmolive, Britannia Industries: VK Sharma May 30, 2017 10:43 AM Business Sell HCC, IDFC Bank, RBL Bk; buy HDFC, Tata Motors DVR: Mitessh Thakkar May 30, 2017 10:08 AM Business Buy, Sell, Hold: 6 stocks that analysts are watching today May 30, 2017 10:05 AM Business Buy Motherson Sumi, HDFC; sell Reliance Power: Ashwani Gujral May 30, 2017 10:02 AM Business Top 5 stocks which can turn out to be multibaggers in next 2-3 years May 30, 2017 09:34 AM Business Here are Sanjiv Bhasin's views on L&T, BHEL & FMCG space May 30, 2017 09:31 AM Business Here are few investment ideas by Prakash Diwan May 30, 2017 09:13 AM Business Here are a few trading ideas from market experts May 30, 2017 08:50 AM News Most Popular Top News Early rains to shower hope for Sensex; top 10 stocks to chase this monsoon Tata Motors cuts up to 1,500 managerial jobs Mid & smallcap stocks crack; 10 stocks which can give up to 50% return This smallcap could pump more profits as it now starts to leverage its assets Top 5 stocks which could turn out to be multibaggers in the next 2-3 years More than 100 stocks have slipped up to 30% from record highs hit in April Market Live: Nifty holds 9600 amid consolidation; NTPC soars 4%, BHEL tanks 10% As monsoon hits Kerala, here's why we keep calm and pray for rain every year see more Video of the day Valuation difference across cos seen, FY18 earnings to be better: HSBC Global AMC Portfolio Markets Watchlist Live TV Show Currencies Commodities Fixed Income Personal Finance Mutual Fund Stock Market India IPO Global Market Budget 2017 BSE Sensex Forum News Business Markets Stocks Economy Mutual Funds Personal Finance IPO Startups Stocks: A | B | C | D | E | F | G | H | I | J | K | L | M | N | O | P | Q | R | S | T | U | V | W | X | Y | Z | Others Mutual Funds: A | B | C | D | E | F | G | H | I | J | K | L | M | N | O | P | Q | R | S | T | U | V | W | X | Y | Z Visit the App Store to see all our apps: Tools Retirement Planning EMI Calculator SIP Calculator SIP Planner Useful Links Budget 2016 Live Sensex Public Sector Banks Best Portfolio Manager Small Savings Schemes Bonds Specials Master Your Money Game Changers Travelcafe SME Special Investment Watch PowerYourTrade MoneyBhai Focus Grow My Money GE Step Ahead SME Step Up Feedback & Info feedback@moneycontrol.com About us | Contact Us | Feedback | Disclaimer | Privacy Statement | Terms of Use | Careers | Financial Terms (Glossary) | FAQs | Sitemap | RSS Feed Copyright © e-Eighteen.com Ltd.

Bunker Labs Seattle hosted its first Bunker Beers event in January in Tacoma at Odd Otter, a veteran owned establishment. (Bunker Labs Photo) Why military veterans make exceptional tech workers, and how Microsoft is helping them land jobs Earlier this month, Microsoft was recognized by the U.S. Department of Defense for its support of National Guard and Reserve military members. Among the ways the Redmond-based company supports troops is through their recruiting efforts. GeekWire’s Taylor Soper has a look at Microsoft’s mission to train and hire veterans.

When the call of duty is technology, veterans rally to support each other through Operation Code Since we covered David Molina’s Operation Code, a non-profit that helps veterans launch careers in technology, the organization has grown into a massive Slack group with 1,200 members and about 60 channels. All of the members are military veterans seeking a community and resources related to coding. Molina’s efforts to get the G.I. Bill to cover coding schools is gaining traction in Congress. Operation Code website. Code Fellows wins approval to accept GI Bill to teach veterans how to code As Stiffler noted in her coverage of Operation Code, Molina has been working with Seattle developer school Code Fellows to help train more veterans in tech skills. Last year, Code Fellows received approval from the Veteran’s Administration to accept funding through the G.I. Bill. Code Fellows continues to offer scholarships and actively recruits veterans to join its program.

File image of Air India aircraft. Reuters The investigative agency on Monday registered three FIRs and a preliminary enquiry (PE) to go into the controversial decisions made by the erstwhile Manmohan Singh government with regard to the two national carriers, including surrender of profitable routes to favour private airlines. The cases have been registered against unidentified officials of Air India, Ministry of Civil Aviation and others under charges of criminal conspiracy, cheating and corruption, CBI spokesperson RK Gaur said. "The cases relate to decisions taken by the the ministry during the tenure of the UPA which caused losses of tens of thousands of crore of rupees to the exchequer," he said. "The allegations relate to purchase of 111 aircraft for national airlines costing about Rs 70,000 crore to benefit foreign aircraft manufacturers. Such a purchase caused an alleged financial loss to the already stressed national carriers," Gaur said about the first FIR. The Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) of India had in 2011 questioned the rationale behind the government's decision to order 111 airplanes for AI and Indian Airlines — 48 from Airbus and 68 from Boeing — for about Rs 70,000 crore in 2006. Calling the decision a "recipe for disaster", the government auditor had said it should have raised "alarm" in the Ministry of Civil Aviation, Public Investment Board and The Planning Commission. The second case pertains to leasing of a large number of aircraft without due consideration, proper route study and marketing or price strategy, he said. "It was also alleged that the aircraft were leased even while aircraft acquisition programme was going on," he said. The third case involves allegations of surrender of profitable routes and timings of Air India to favour national and international private players which allegedly caused a "huge" loss to the state-run carrier. In its report on the merger of Air India and Indian Airlines, the CAG had called it "ill-timed". Now the CBI will go into various aspects of the merger. The government auditor had said,"The financial case for the merger was not adequately validated prior to the merger." The merger proposal had received the Manmohan Singh cabinet's approval on 1 March, 2007. The CBI's action follows the Supreme Court's 5 January direction on a petition filed by the Centre for public interest litigation led by lawyer Prashant Bhushan. CBI sources said "all stakeholders" were under its scanner with regard to the merger of the two state-run airlines. The process for the merger was initiated by the then civil aviation minister Praful Patel of NCP on March 16, 2006. Patel had sought a concept paper on the merger and a presentation was made before the prime minister on March 22 that year. A group of ministers (GoM) had later examined the proposal. Indian Airlines officially merged with Air India in April 2007. The current Air India chairman-cum-managing director Ashwani Lohani had recently said the merger was behind Air India's "downfall". Finance Minister Arun Jaitley had on Saturday favoured disinvestment of Air India, saying the airline’s market share was just around 14 per cent whereas its debt burden stood at a staggering Rs 50,000 crore. #Air india#Cag#Cbi#Indian airlines#Manmohan singh government#Ministry of civil aviation#Newstracker#Upa government Published Date: May 30, 2017 08:05 am | Updated Date: May 30, 2017 08:05 am Also See CBI lodges cases to probe Indian Airlines-Air India merger, purchase of 111 planes Coal scam: CBI urges court to award ex-coal secretary HC Gupta seven years for criminal conspiracy CBI raids P Chidambaram's homes: Is the father staring at political downfall triggered by son Karti?

(Photo: Detroit News Photo Archive) 3 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 3 COMMENTEMAILMORE Mark Fields is the latest Ford Motor Co. chief executive ousted from a company where big decisions still are very much influenced by its founding family. Henry Ford II didn’t like Lee Iacocca, and said so publicly. Don Petersen ran afoul of Hank the Deuce and tried to sideline the next generation of the family. Jac Nasser angered dealers and employees, important constituencies to the family. And Fields, named to the top job less than three years ago, was judged to be the wrong guy at the wrong time, despite presiding over two years of record profits. “We had a board meeting (last) Friday, and following that, Mark and I got together and we decided that it was the right time for him to resign,” Executive Chairman Bill Ford Jr. said when Fields’ departure — and the appointment of Jim Hackett as president and CEO — was announced May 22. “So really only at that point did we activate (Hackett) as the new CEO.” The automaker is in a hurry. Amid plateauing vehicle sales and lagging quality, Ford is trying to cement its place in a rapidly changing industry with newcomers Tesla Inc., Waymo, Apple Inc. and others from Silicon Valley. Hackett, a management veteran with a reputation for teamwork and attention-grabbing moves in his time as head of Steelcase Inc., follows Fields as a “change agent” who Bill Ford Jr. hopes will dismantle the management hierarchy and better deliver the message that the automaker is a future-looking company. “With Mark, it was kind of a retrenchment to some of that Ford history,” said David Cole, chairman emeritus at the Center for Automotive Research. “That, plus the decline in the value, put a lot of pressure on all the shareholders, which included the Ford family… I think they perceived Mark Fields as business as usual. And that turned out to be the kiss of death. “That would have scared the liver out of anybody.” Ford CEOs have always had tough jobs for a multitude of reasons. Few could have filled Alan Mulally’s shoes, according to Cole. “One of the toughest jobs in the world is to replace somebody who was viewed as an icon,” Cole said. “That was a horrifying job that Mark had.” History of clashes Since Henry Ford II fired automotive legend Lee Iacocca in 1978, Ford CEOs and presidents have stayed with the company for an average of four years — not including Bill Ford Jr.’s tenure in the 2000s. Fields was fired two years and 11 months after his appointment to succeed Mulally, whose tenure ran for nearly eight years. The family with its name on the cars of the 114-year-old automaker remains a guiding and stabilizing force within the company. Bill Ford Jr. and his cousin Edsel Ford II sit on the 16-member board. As chairman since 1999, Bill Ford Jr. is the voice of the Ford family. Record profits and sales under Fields were marred by an unclear vision for the future. His retirement came as the board grew less confident in Fields and more involved in pushing for a clear path forward for the company. Chief Executive Officer of Ford Mark Fields speaks before before the unveiling of the 2018 Lincoln Navigator at the New York International Auto Show on April 12, 2017 at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center in New York City. The New York International Auto Show will open to the public starting Friday April 14 and run through April 23.  (Photo: Drew Angerer / Getty Images) A board vote ousted Fields, not a shareholder vote. In recent months, Ford’s outside directors began to delve more deeply into Fields’ strategy for the future and grew increasingly troubled with the company’s direction and Fields’ ability to lead it, according to a source familiar with the situation. The Ford family’s 70.9 million shares make up less than 2 percent of the company shares, yet the stake gives the family 40 percent of the voting power within the company, according to a February regulatory filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Under a structure established when the automaker went public in 1956, a single Class B share is equivalent to 16 common shares, and can be owned only by family members. The weighted shares have been challenged by recurring proposals at annual meetings, but those challenges have been routinely voted down. Dissident shareholders like John Chevedden have called the super-votes unfair because they give the Ford family so much control. “The super-voting shares effectively give them veto power over any decisions,” said Bryce Hoffman, author of “American Icon: Alan Mulally and the Fight to Save Ford Motor Company” and a former Detroit News auto writer. “But the company still has to satisfy the public markets. Nobody can force the family to do something they don’t want to do. That doesn’t make it immune to the market.” Ford CEOs have historically clashed with the family even during periods of growth. But that doesn’t appear to be the case with the dismissal of Fields, as pressure came from outside directors. Iacocca, whose eight-year run as Ford’s president began in 1970, infamously butted heads with then-Chairman and CEO Henry Ford II. Even bringing the wildly popular Ford Mustang to the market in 1964 and running the Blue Oval during Detroit’s Golden Age didn’t keep Iacocca in good standing with Hank the Deuce. “It’s personal, and I can’t tell you any more. It’s just one of those things,” the grandson of the company’s founder told Iacocca when firing him, according to “Iacocca: An Autobiography.” When Iacocca pressed, Hank the Deuce replied: “Well, sometimes you just don’t like somebody.” Alan Mulally, CEO of Ford, arrives on set of Good Morning America to reveal the new 2015 Ford Mustang on December 5, 2013 in New York City. The 2015 model marks the 50th anniversary of the Ford Mustang line.  (Photo: Andrew Burton / Getty Images) Phil Caldwell, a loyal lieutenant of Hank the Deuce, took over the presidency from Iacocca. In 1981, he became the first company CEO whose last name was not Ford. In the four years before his retirement, Caldwell led the company through some of its most difficult years, including competition from Japanese carmakers. Bill Ford Jr. and his cousin Edsel Ford II worked their ways into the company’s highest ranks in the late ’80s and early ’90s. Donald Petersen, Ford’s CEO from 1985-89, was known to quote Edsel Ford in saying there were no crown princes at the Blue Oval. “I’m not a caretaker for anybody,” Petersen told Fortune magazine in 1989. “I admire the fact that (Edsel and Bill) are trying very hard to go as far as they can. But being a Ford does not give them a leg up. The principle we must operate on is that selection to top management is based solely on merit.” Amid disagreements with the board and the Ford family, Petersen was forced out. Then as now, the company’s leadership cannot be separated from the family. Bill Ford Jr. told The New York Times in 1993, “When people joined this company, they knew we held this unique position. So if it makes other people uncomfortable, I guess I’m sorry. But it’s a fact of life they’re going to have to live with.” Harold “Red” Poling, who followed Petersen as CEO from 1990 to 1992, appeared to have few disputes with the family and retired from the company at age 68. But when Bill Ford Jr. became chairman in 1998 — a position that was held by then-CEO and President Alex Trotman — Trotman spat, “So now you have your monarchy back, Prince William,” Fortune reported in 2000. The family oversight has often proved beneficial, according to Hoffman. He said they were instrumental in pushing out CEO Jac Nasser in 2001 after less than two years on the job amid conflicts with dealers and employees – and the Firestone rollover crisis. That crisis linked faulty tires used on the Ford Explorer and other vehicles to 200 deaths and 800 injuries, leading to a recall and replacement of 20 million tires.

He recruited Alan Mulally from Boeing Co. in 2006 to lead a sweeping industrial restructuring as the automaker slipped into crisis and then the Great Recession, which pushed two Detroit rivals into bankruptcy. Mulally was credited with changing the culture at Ford by fostering teamwork under his “One Ford” mantra. During his tenure, Mulally cut six of Ford’s eight brands and mortgaged the company’s assets — including the Blue Ovals on the sides of World Headquarters — to carry it through the Great Recession. Mulally was well-regarded within the company. In 2014, Mulally left the company on his own terms. And with board approval, he backed Fields to succeed him. Feeling the pressure Shares fell 40 percent under Fields, vehicle quality slipped and strategic decisions were delayed or slow to come to market. The company was void of short-term achievements despite long-term aspirations, analysts say, and Fields engaged in rhetorical battles with President Donald Trump. This pressured the board and frustrated shareholders, despite record sales and profits. Fields’ pay packages, determined solely by a compensation committee of outside directors, signaled more dissatisfaction with his leadership. Last year, Ford’s top five executives missed out on hundreds of thousands in bonus pay because the company failed to meet quality standards. While Fields still made a $2.7 million incentive bonus for meeting company goals last year, he missed out on additional bonuses as CEO that were awarded to other executives to “recognize and reward exceptional performance.” During his time as CEO he was never awarded one of those incremental bonuses, according to Ford proxy statements. “We’re as frustrated as you are by the stock price,” Bill Ford Jr. said during the company’s annual shareholders meeting May 11. “Most of (the Ford family’s) net worth is tied up in the company, and stock price matters a lot to us.” Cole said the lagging stock price amplified other troubling factors under Fields. “They want (their shares) to be profitable,” he said. “Unless the world thinks Ford is a good investment, it’s not good for the family. In (Fields’) case, both the family and the external shareholders (were asking) what’s wrong with this picture.” The re-emerging “Old Ford” culture of hierarchy – and a lack of clarity about where the company was going – caused concern in the company, according to comments Bill Ford Jr. made after Fields’ departure. The board feared the company would fail to compete in an industry headed toward automation and areas like ride-sharing. Ford Motor Co. CEO and president Alan Mulally, left, executive chairman Bill Ford and president of the Americas Mark Fields pose together at the North American International Auto Show on Sunday, Jan. 11, 2009 in Detroit.  (Photo: Carlos Osorio / Associated Press) “There was a lot of talk from Mark and not a lot of action,” said Hoffman. He said Fields failed to follow “this amazing management system” Mulally left, which is part of the reason he didn’t last. Bill Ford Jr. said as much in an interview with The Detroit News last week: “I didn’t feel the ‘Old Ford’ so much as I felt the stress. When Alan was here, he engendered such a sense of can-do and optimism. And maybe we lost a little of that.” The key for Hackett will be delivering quick results, according to Hoffman and Cole. “Hackett got on the radar screen (and) obviously, Bill was very enamored with his performance,” said Cole, adding that the 62-year-old CEO will have to implement a culture of change in a short amount of time. The company, he said, “can’t go back.” ithibodeau@detroitnews.com Twitter: @Ian_Thibodeau 3 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 3 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://detne.ws/2sfsgRZ TOP VIDEOS Flyover of the Little Caesars Arena neighborhood 0:38 Spirit airlines unveils new maintenance hangar at DTW 1:24 Raw video: Taking a hot lap on Belle Isle 3:58 Little Caesars world headquarters hosts 'topping out' ceremony 1:33 Entrepreneur/actor Hill Harper an admirer of Detroit 2:55 Construction continues on M-59 1:51 Packard site owner: 'We will not fail' 2:56 QLine prepares for its debut 1:35 Patterson concerned about job skills gap 2:51 Mayor Mike Duggan on the new Flex-N-Gate facility 0:47

He also said the purchase decision was cleared by the former finance minister P Chidambaram-led Empowered Group of Ministers. The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has registered three separate cases in connection with the alleged irregularities in the purchase or hiring of the aircraft during the tenure of Patel. The move by CBI is crucial as it has already initiated a preliminary inquiry into all these aspects after the Supreme Court's direction in November 2013. Patel said when the UPA government came to power, Air India was struggling with its old fleet. In 2003, the Vajpayee government decided to disinvest in Air India, and therefore no new acquisition was considered. "In 2004, the UPA government decided to continue AI as a public sector undertaking (PSU). At the time, I informed the prime minister (Manmohan Singh) that it was difficult to turn around AI with its current fleet and precarious financial condition. The government decided there was need to continue AI operations but to induct new planes as the international and domestic competition was taking away customers," Patel said. Accordingly, the AI board decided on a comprehensive long-term strategy to induct new planes and phase out the aging ones. Indian Airlines decided to purchase 43 Airbus 320s family aircraft and AI decided to induct the long -haul Boeing 777 and the new generation 787 Dream Liner. The AI board issued a tender, while IA had had already completed the tendering process during the previous government. "I wrote to the PM informing him that since this was a large purchase, we should have an oversight committee to oversee the entire process. The PM appointed CG Somiah, a former CAG and CVC, to overlook the entire process,'' Patel said. Later, the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) constituted the Chidambaram-led EGoM to discuss with manufacturers and negotiate the best possible price. "The EGoM finalised all transactions and orders with Boeing and Air Bus, respectively. The decision by EGoM was ratified by the PM and the Cabinet," he noted. Patel reiterated that the entire process was done through bidding, and even before going to the Cabinet for ratification, his ministry wrote to the then CAG and CVC to examine all documents. However, he said they declined to do so saying that it was not required at that stage. Further, even in the context of the number of aircraft, it is important to mention that even though the order was finalised in December 2005, all the aircraft have not been delivered as on the date, Patel said. "Twenty three aircraft have been delivered in the last three years. If there was something wrong, it should have been addressed accordingly," Patel said. He said the finance ministry had given a sovereign guarantee to cover the purchase in view of AI's precarious financial position.

The agency has also registered a preliminary enquiry to look into the merger of Air India and erstwhile Indian Airlines which the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) had called "ill-timed". The cases have bee registered against unidentified officials of Air India, Ministry of Civil Aviation and others under charges of criminal conspiracy, cheating and corruption, CBI spokesperson R K Gaur said. The cases relate to decisions taken by the the ministry during the tenure of the UPA which caused losses of "tens of thousands of crore of rupees" to the exchequer, he said. "The allegations relate to purchase of 111 aircraft for national airlines costing about Rs 70,000 crore to benefit foreign aircraft manufacturers. Such a purchase caused an alleged financial loss to the already stressed national carriers," Gaur said about the first FIR. The CAG had in 2011 questioned the rationale behind the government's decision to order 111 airplanes for AI and Indian Airlines--48 from Airbus and 68 from Boeing for about Rs 70,000 crore in 2006. Calling the decision a "recipe for disaster", the government auditor has said it should have raised "alarm" in the Ministry of Civil Aviation, Public Investment Board and The planning commission. The second case pertains to leasing of a large number of aircraft without due consideration, proper route study and marketing or price strategy, he said. "It was also alleged that the aircraft were leased even while aircraft acquisition programme was going on," he said. The third case involves allegations of surrender of profitable routes and timings of Air India to favour national and international private players which alleged caused a "huge" loss to the state-run carrier. In its report on the merger of Air India and Indian Airlines, the CAG had called it "ill-timed". Now the CBI will go into various aspects of the merger. The government auditor had said,"The financial case for the merger was not adequately validated prior to the merger." The merger proposal had received the Manmohan Singh cabinet's approval on March 1, 2007. The CBI's action follows the Supreme Court's January 5 direction on a petition filed by the Centre for Public Interest Litigation led by lawyer Prashant Bhushan. CBI sources said "all stakeholders" were under its scanner with regard to the merger of the two state-run airlines. The process for the merger was initiated by the Civil Aviation Minister Praful Patel of NCP on March 16, 2006. Patel had sought a concept paper on the merger and a presentation was made before the prime minister on March 22 that year. A Group of Ministers (GoM) had later examined the proposal before. Indian Airlines officially merged with Air India in April 2007. The current Air India Chairman-cum-Managing Director Ashwani Lohani had recently said the merger was behind Air India's "downfall". Finance Minister Arun Jaitley had on Saturday favoured disinvestment of Air India, saying the airline's market share was just around 14 per cent whereas its debt burden stood at a staggering Rs 50,000 crore.

Finance Minister Arun Jaitley had on Saturday favoured disinvestment of Air India, saying the airline's market share was just around 14 per cent whereas its debt burden stood at a staggering Rs 50,000 crore.

THE CANADIAN PRESS/Sean Kilpatrick Previous Next Prime Minister Justin Trudeau meets with Pope Francis for a private audience at the Vatican on Monday, May 29, 2017. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Sean Kilpatrick Highlights from the news file for Monday, May 29 ——— POPE OPEN TO RESIDENTIAL SCHOOLS APOLOGY, PM SAYS: Canadians are anxious to reconcile with Indigenous Peoples, Justin Trudeau described telling Pope Francis on Monday as he asked the pontiff to apologize for the role the Catholic Church played in the tragedy of residential schools. The Pope — himself no stranger to the cause of social justice, he noted to Trudeau — seemed open to the idea, the prime minister said as he related the broad strokes of their private conversation at the Vatican. "He reminded me that his entire life has been dedicated to supporting marginalized people in the world," Trudeau said after he arrived back in Rome. Pope Francis also expressed his enthusiasm for working with the prime minister and the Canadian bishops on finding a way forward on the issue of an apology, as recommended by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. The commission included the demand for a papal apology — to survivors, their families and communities — as one of the 94 recommendations in its report on the dark 120-year history and tragic legacy of residential schools. ——— SCHEER GETS HERO'S WELCOME FROM TORY CAUCUS: New Conservative leader Andrew Scheer is basking in a hero's welcome on Parliament Hill. The Saskatchewan member of Parliament was feted by his fellow MPs and leadership rivals alike as he arrived Monday to address the Tory caucus, fresh off a thrilling final-ballot win in the party's leadership contest on the weekend. He called the role a great honour, but an even greater responsibility. Scheer touched on all of the same themes he delivered following Saturday night's win, hailing the efforts of the other 12 candidates who sought the job and singling out Quebec MP Maxime Bernier in particular. Bernier was the presumptive front-runner throughout the race and the leader throughout Saturday night's nail-biting process of elimination, right up until the last ballot. He did not stop to speak to reporters prior to Monday's meeting. Scheer did have significant support among other elected MPs going into the campaign, about two dozen by the end of it. Many of the rest had backed fellow MP Erin O'Toole. ——— NDP LEADERSHIP CANDIDATE PREGNANT: NDP leadership candidate Niki Ashton says she is expecting a baby in November. Ashton, a Manitoba MP, is one of six candidates seeking the party's top job. The leadership race is scheduled to wrap up in October, when rank-and-file members pick a successor to Tom Mulcair. Ashton says she plans to carry on her work, adding she will continue to reach out to party members, activists and progressives across Canada. She says she intends to visit B.C. and the Atlantic provinces in the next two weeks. Ashton's rivals in the race include Quebec MP Guy Caron, Ontario legislature member Jagmeet Singh, Ontario MP Charlie Angus, former veterans ombudsman Pat Stogran and B.C. MP Peter Julian. ——— SACRED FIRE LIT TO LAUNCH MISSING WOMEN INQUIRY: A sacred fire ceremony in Whitehorse has marked the first family hearings of the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls. About 30 people gathered in a circle at sunrise for traditional prayers and songs as the fire was lit this morning. It will burn until the hearings conclude in Whitehorse later this week. Forty families are registered to testify before the commissioners in both public and private hearings between Tuesday and Thursday. Commissioners will be examining and reporting on the causes of violence against indigenous females by scrutinizing practices, policies and institutions, including policing and child welfare. Yukon minister responsible for the women's directorate, Jeanie Dendys, says 41 indigenous women have disappeared or been killed in the territory over several decades. Council of Yukon First Nations Grand Chief Peter Johnston says he's pleased the families of missing and murdered women in the territory finally have a chance to present their stories and share their challenges. ——— CANADIANS WEIGH IN ON PLANNED ACCESSIBILITY LAW: Public consultations on Canada's first national law for disabled people have identified high unemployment rates, inaccessible buildings and barriers in transportation as some of the key issues that need to be addressed. The priorities were laid out in a report, released by the federal government Monday, summarizing eight months of consultations held with Canadians from coast to coast. It says participants wanted to see laws that would help lower stubbornly high unemployment rates for those with disabilities, reduce the number of buildings inaccessible to those with physical and intellectual disabilities, and remove accessibility barriers for the country's air, rail, ferry and bus transportation systems. The report also says Canadians have voiced a strong preference for the government to set up an independent body to oversee compliance with the new laws, which are expected to come before the House of Commons in early 2018. ——— GOVERNMENT ANNOUNCES FAMINE RELIEF FUND: Aid agencies are urging Canadians to respond generously to the federal government's matching fund for famine relief in Africa and the Middle East, calling it a response to the worst humanitarian crisis in decades. The Liberal government said Monday it would match donations made by Canadians to registered charities to create a famine relief fund for more than 20 million men, women and children who are at risk of starvation. International Development Minister Marie-Claude Bibeau said the fund would support Canadian and international organizations working to provide assistance in Nigeria, Somalia, South Sudan and Yemen and neighbouring regions. Bibeau said the government's window to match donations is from March 17 to June 30. Millions of people in the four affected countries and neighbouring regions are in need of necessities including water, sanitation services, shelter and urgent food assistance, Bibeau added. ——— JUDGE BANS ABORTION PROTESTS AT NEW BRUNSWICK HOSPITAL: As provinces across Canada move to establish protest-free "buffer zones" around abortion providers, a judge has banned anti-abortion activists from demonstrating outside a hospital in northern New Brunswick. Court of Queen's Bench Judge Reginald Leger granted a permanent injunction against protesters outside the Chaleur Regional Hospital in Bathurst. The anti-abortion picketers, affiliated with the 40 Days for Life campaign, put the safety of patients and employees at risk, Leger said in his recent decision. The ruling comes amid efforts across the country to strike a balance between the constitutional right to free expression and ensuring safe access to health-care services without harassment or intimidation. Ontario Attorney General Yasir Naqvi said Monday he plans to introduce legislation that would create safe zones outside abortion clinics in that province, citing reports of harassment at an Ottawa clinic. The Newfoundland and Labrador government introduced a law last November, modelled after British Columbia's Access to Abortion Services Act, to keep protesters at least 50 metres away from an abortion clinic. ——— FILINGS SHED LIGHT ON BOMBARDIER-BOEING DISPUTE: Boeing says its trade complaint against Bombardier is designed to prevent the Montreal-based rival from using subsidies to build a larger version of the CSeries plane that would directly compete with its own flagship narrowbody 737 aircraft. Last week, Boeing filed a document with the U.S. International Trade Commission that sheds new light on the tit-for-tat dispute between the two aerospace manufacturers. In the 109-page filing, Boeing said Bombardier would be positioned to build a full-fleet of single-aisle planes — repeating a strategy employed by French aerospace company Airbus — if Canadian subsidies to Bombardier are left unaddressed. Bombardier said in a separate filing that Boeing's effort to shut down its innovative technology from the market is "misguided," adding that the complaint is tantamount to asking the U.S. International Trade Commission to imagine a hypothetical world in the future. ——— QUEBEC TABLES BACK-TO-WORK CONSTRUCTION BILL: The Quebec government tabled a bill Monday forcing the province's striking construction workers back on the job by Wednesday. In response, a coalition of construction unions promised to contest the bill in court, saying the legislation favours construction companies. Thousands of workers gathered in front of Quebec's legislature earlier Monday to voice their disapproval of the government's decision to end their strike after five days. The back-to-work bill maintains current working conditions for the province's 175,000 construction workers and grants them a pay raise of 1.8 per cent. It also opens an immediate five-month mediation period after which the unions and construction companies will be required to enter into arbitration. Members of the legislature are expected to debate the bill late into the night but the Liberal majority in the legislature will ensure it passes. Quebec Labour Minister Dominique Vien said before tabling her bill that both sides had months to negotiate a new agreement and added that every strike day costs the Quebec economy $45 million. ——— ONTARIO TAXPAYERS FOOT $120K BILL FOR GIANT DUCK: An Ontario government grant of about $120,000 that is going toward a giant rubber duck for Canada 150 celebrations is ruffling some feathers. The 18.6-metre, 13,600-kilogram yellow duck is being brought to Toronto by the Redpath Waterfront Festival, reportedly at a total cost of $200,000, combining other funding. It's being billed as a tourist attraction — with particular Instagram and selfie appeal — and will also be taken to other communities in Ontario. Ontario's Progressive Conservatives say they're unclear on the giant duck's connection to Canada's heritage celebrations and call it a waste of taxpayer money. Tourism, Culture and Sport Minister Eleanor McMahon says the province has been funding the waterfront festival for the past three years and it does a good job promoting tourism. She cautions against focusing too much on the duck, adding she thinks it is much ado about nothing. © Copyright Times Colonist Email to a Friend Your Email Address: * Your Name: * To Email Address: * Message: * * Please separate multiple email addresses with the semi-colon character.

By: Express News Service | New Delhi | Published:May 30, 2017 1:58 am The Union Cabinet had cleared the Indian Airlines-Air India merger proposal in March 2007. The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has registered three FIRs and launched a preliminary enquiry to probe alleged irregularities in Indian Airlines-Air India merger and purchase of 111 aircraft, leasing of planes and giving-up of profit-making routes by Air India. These decisions, according to the CBI, caused a loss to the tune of thousands of crores of rupees to the exchequer. The Union Cabinet had cleared the Indian Airlines-Air India merger proposal in March 2007. NCP leader Praful Patel was the civil aviation minister when both the merger and acquisition of Boeing aircraft to expand fleet took place. CBI spokesperson R K Gaur said the FIRs have been registered for offences of criminal conspiracy and corruption against unidentified officials of the ministry and Air India. The cases relate to decisions taken by the ministry during the tenure of the UPA government causing a loss of “tens of thousands of crore” of rupees to the exchequer, he said. A preliminary enquiry has been registered to probe the merger, while 3 FIRs have been lodged to probe alleged irregularities in the purchase of 111 aircraft, leasing of planes while acquisition process was still on, and giving-up of profitable routes in favour of national and international airlines by Air India, Gaur said. In a report tabled in Parliament in January 2012, CAG had flagged these irregularities and called the decision to acquire 111 planes by Air India “a recipe for disaster”, which should have raised alarm in the government. It said the aircraft acquisition through debt had “contributed predominantly” to the airline’s massive debt liability. CAG had also called the merger of Air India and Indian Airlines “ill-timed” and pointed out that “the financial case for the merger was not adequately validated prior to the merger”. “The entire acquisition (for both Air India and Indian Airlines) was to be funded through debt (to be repaid through revenue generation), except for a relatively small equity infusion of Rs 325 crore for Indian Airlines. This was a recipe for disaster and should have raised alarm signals in Ministry of Civil Aviation, Public Investment Board and the Planning Commission,” the report said. The CAG also flagged the “speed” at which the acquisition process for 68 aircraft was dealt with and observed that it was based on “flawed” assumptions. Given that the initial proposal was made in December 1996, CAG had said that acquisition process took an “unduly long time” and only in January 2004 a plan was made to buy 28 planes, which was revisited and later increased to 68 aircraft. “This increase in numbers does not withstand audit scrutiny, considering the market requirements obtaining then or forecast for the future, as also the commercial viability projected to justify the acquisition. The acquisition appears to be supply-driven”, the report had said. Terming the merger “ill-timed”, the report had said this exercise was undertaken “strangely from the top (rather than by the perceived needs of both these airlines), with inadequate validation of the financial benefits”.

The CBI will probe the controversial merger of Air India and Indian Airlines, besides alleged irregularities in purchase and lease of aircraft by the two state-run carriers under the UPA government which caused "huge" losses to the exchequer. The investigative agency today registered three FIRs and a preliminary enquiry (PE) to go into the controversial decisions made by the erstwhile Manmohan Singh government with regard to the two national carriers, including surrender of profitable routes to favour private airlines. The cases have been registered against unidentified officials of Air India, Ministry of Civil Aviation and others under charges of criminal conspiracy, cheating and corruption, CBI spokesperson R K Gaur said. "The cases relate to decisions taken by the the ministry during the tenure of the UPA which caused losses of tens of thousands of crore of rupees to the exchequer," he said. "The allegations relate to purchase of 111 aircraft for national airlines costing about Rs 70,000 crore to benefit foreign aircraft manufacturers. Such a purchase caused an alleged financial loss to the already stressed national carriers," Gaur said about the first FIR. The CAG had in 2011 questioned the rationale behind the government's decision to order 111 airplanes for AI and Indian Airlines--48 from Airbus and 68 from Boeing-- for about Rs 70,000 crore in 2006. Calling the decision a "recipe for disaster", the government auditor had said it should have raised "alarm" in the Ministry of Civil Aviation, Public Investment Board and The Planning Commission. The second case pertains to leasing of a large number of aircraft without due consideration, proper route study and marketing or price strategy, he said. "It was also alleged that the aircraft were leased even while aircraft acquisition programme was going on," he said. The third case involves allegations of surrender of profitable routes and timings of Air India to favour national and international private players which allegedly caused a "huge" loss to the state-run carrier. In its report on the merger of Air India and Indian Airlines, the CAG had called it "ill-timed". Now the CBI will go into various aspects of the merger. The government auditor had said,"The financial case for the merger was not adequately validated prior to the merger." The merger proposal had received the Manmohan Singh cabinet's approval on March 1, 2007. The CBI's action follows the Supreme Court's January 5 direction on a petition filed by the Centre for Public Interest Litigation led by lawyer Prashant Bhushan. CBI sources said "all stakeholders" were under its scanner with regard to the merger of the two state-run airlines. The process for the merger was initiated by the then Civil Aviation Minister Praful Patel of NCP on March 16, 2006. Patel had sought a concept paper on the merger and a presentation was made before the prime minister on March 22 that year. A Group of Ministers (GoM) had later examined the proposal. Indian Airlines officially merged with Air India in April 2007. The current Air India Chairman-cum-Managing Director Ashwani Lohani had recently said the merger was behind Air India's "downfall". Finance Minister Arun Jaitley had on Saturday favoured disinvestment of Air India, saying the airline's market share was just around 14 per cent whereas its debt burden stood at a staggering Rs 50,000 crore.

New Delhi:  The Central Bureau of Investigation or CBI will probe the controversial merger of Air India and Indian Airlines, besides alleged irregularities in purchase and lease of aircraft by the two state-run carriers under the Congress-led UPA coalition government which it said has caused "huge" losses to the taxpayer. The investigative agency today registered three FIRs and a preliminary enquiry to go into the controversial decisions made by the erstwhile Manmohan Singh government with regard to the two national carriers, including surrender of profitable routes to favour private airlines.

X Russia squares up to Boeing and Airbus with maiden flight of jet Medium-range aircraft capable of seating more than 200 completes 30-minute flight about 12 hours ago The MC-21-300 passenger airliner during its maiden flight in Irkutsk, Russia. Photograph: Irkut Corporation/EPA         Russia carried out the maiden flight of its new MS-21 medium-range passenger aircraft on Sunday, its first post-Soviet foray into production of a mainline commercial aircraft which it hopes will rival those of its western competitors. In a surprise statement, manufacturer Irkut Corporation and its state-controlled parent company United Aircraft Corporation (UAC) said an MS-21-300 model had successfully completed a 30-minute flight at a height of 1,000m and travelling at 300km/h. Squeezed by western sanctions over its role in the Ukraine crisis, Russia is trying to rejuvenate domestic industrial production to make the country less dependant on foreign firms. The test flight, which was not announced to the media beforehand, comes just three weeks after China staged the maiden flight of its new C919 passenger jet, highlighting the growing competition to industry heavyweights Boeing and Airbus. Russian officials have said the MS-21 is superior to its western-made counterparts in many respects and will be snapped up by both Russian and foreign carriers, but western analysts say both Russia and China face a huge challenge to shatter the transatlantic aircraft duopoly. “The flight mission has been completed. The flight was fine, there were no observations which will prevent further testing,” test pilot Oleg Kononenko was quoted as saying. Flight’s brevity Western aviation sources however expressed surprise at the flight’s brevity and relatively low altitude compared with recent three- to four-hour debuts of North American and European models. “It suggests they either have severe limitations or may have had something happen and decided to come back,” said a western flight test engineer, speaking on condition of anonymity. A western aircraft-making source called it a “genteel flight”. A UAC spokesman said the flight had been long enough to test everything that needed to be checked in the air. Russia has fought hard to shake off its Soviet reputation for old and creaking aircraft flown by inexperienced crews. Flag carrier Aeroflot last year earned its fourth star from independent ratings website Skytrax, ranking it alongside major European and Middle Eastern competitors and ahead of big US carriers such as Delta and United. President Vladimir Putin called Irkut general director Oleg Demchenko to congratulate him and his employees with what the Kremlin called “a significant event”. The twin-engined MS-21 will be built in two variants: the MS-21-300, which will have 160-211 seats; and the later MS-21-200, which will have 130-165 seats. It is sometimes referred to as the MC-21 when using the Russian name and Cyrillic letters. Production is expected to start in the next two years and state media has said numerous contracts with domestic and foreign carriers have already been agreed. Irkut said it so far had “firm orders” for 175 aircraft. America’s Boeing and Europe’s Airbus remain far ahead of their Chinese and Russian rivals, with bigger sales books and more advanced technical know-how. But the new aircraft could win sales in Russia and some eastern European and Asian countries, industry analysts say, with buyers attracted by its lower running costs. With a range of up to 6,000km, the MS-21 will be competing against the Boeing 737 and Airbus A320 aircraft which currently dominate the medium-range narrow-body market. Both companies recently upgraded those families to achieve comparable 15 per cent operational savings compared to previous versions. – (Reuters)       Topics: Oleg Demchenko Oleg Kononenko Aeroflot Airbus Boeing Irkut United Aircraft China East Aimak Europe Russia Ukraine United States Read More Eight British Airways flights from Dublin cancelled over IT failure Knock Airport leads the way in Irish passenger growth BA chief says he will not resign over IT problems Road Warrior: Alitalia bid deadline ICG sells 21-year-old vessel for €45m Steering parts shortage stalls BMW car production What now for DAA as Toland checks out three years early?

Latest Business Technology Artificial Intelligence VR/AR Autonomous Vehicles Graphene Financial Glossary Latest Business Technology Artificial Intelligence VR/AR Autonomous Vehicles Graphene Financial Glossary MC-21-300 new Russian airliner maiden flight completed MC-21-300 new Russian airliner maiden flight completed May 29, 2017, 7:32 PM BST | Written by Christian Nordqvist | MC-21-300, the new Russian commercial airliner, has completed its maiden flight at an airfield of the Irkutsk Aviation Plant, Irkut Corporation announced today. Irkut Corporation, part of the United Aircraft Corporation, is a Moscow-based aircraft manufacturer. The maiden flight lasted thirty minutes, during which the new airplane reached an altitude of 1,000 meters and a speed of 300 km/h. Squeezed by economic sanctions by the United States, much of Europe, and other allies, Russia is attempting to revive domestic industrial production to make the country more economically self-sufficient. This Russian airplane’s test flight, which had not been announced to the media in advance, comes just three weeks after the maiden flight of China’s new C919 passenger jet. According to Irkut Corporation: “The airliner is offered to the customers with two options of power plant – PW1400G of Pratt & Whitney Company (USA) or PD-14 of United Engine Corporation (Russia). New-generation engines feature reduced fuel consumption, low noise and hazardous emissions. MC-21 aircraft meets prospective environmental requirements.” (Image: adapted from eng.irkut.com) Suddenly, the global market is looking much more precarious for the two commercial aviation giants, America’s Boeing and and Europe’s Airbus. In a Reuters article, Gleb Stolyarov and Jack Stubbs wrote that Western aviation experts expressed surprise at how short the maiden flight was, as well as its low altitude. Most American and European maiden flights last from three to four hours. Reuters quoted an ‘anonymous’ Western flight test engineer, who said: “It suggests they either have severe limitations or may have had something happen and decided to come back.” The test pilots Oleg Kononenko (far left) and Roman Taskayev, talking to Oleg Demchenko, President of Irkut Corporation.

(Image: eng.irkut.com) MC-21-300 flight successful – Irkut claims The company said that during the MC-21-300 maiden flight, a simulated landing approach was performed, followed by a flight over the runway, climbing and then turning. This is a common technique for a new aircraft’s maiden flight. MC-21-300 was piloted by Oleg Kononenko, crew commander, and Roman Taskayev, copilot. Mr. Kononenko said: “Flight mission is accomplished. The flight went in the normal mode. There are no obstacles revealed preventing the tests continuation.” Mr. Taskayev added: “Characteristics and operational modes of the power plant are confirmed, all aircraft systems operated without glitches.” President of Irkut Corporation, Oleg Demchenko, said: “Today is the historic day for our personnel and the whole big team, which works on creation of MC-21 aircraft. We put the most advanced technical solutions in our aircraft, to provide enhanced comfort for passengers and attractive economic characteristics for air carriers.” MC-21-300 team members at Irkutsk Aviation Plant on the day of the maiden flight.

I congratulate all project participants on our common holiday!” MC-21-300 New Russian Aircraft MC-21-300 is a next-generation commercial airplane with a capacity of between 163 and 211 passengers. Irkut Corporation says that the aircraft has the largest fuselage diameter in the category of narrow-body aircraft, which provides passengers with a qualitatively new level of comfort. According to a press release by Irkut Corporation: “This design decision significantly widens private space of each passenger, ensures free passage of passenger and service trolley over the aisle, and shortens airport turnover time. ” “Natural lighting of the passenger cabin is enhanced due to big windows. Comfortable air pressure and advanced microclimate will be maintained in the aircraft.” Western experts wondered why the maiden flight was so short – just 30 minutes. Test flights in Europe and North America generally last from three to four hours.

The investigative agency today registered three FIRs and a preliminary enquiry (PE) to go into the controversial decisions made by the erstwhile Manmohan Singh government with regard to the two national carriers, including surrender of profitable routes to favour private airlines. The cases have been registered against unidentified officials of Air India, Ministry of Civil Aviation and others under charges of criminal conspiracy, cheating and corruption, CBI spokesperson R K Gaur said. “The cases relate to decisions taken by the the ministry during the tenure of the UPA which caused losses of tens of thousands of crore of rupees to the exchequer,” he said. “The allegations relate to purchase of 111 aircraft for national airlines costing about Rs 70,000 crore to benefit foreign aircraft manufacturers. Such a purchase caused an alleged financial loss to the already stressed national carriers,” Gaur said about the first FIR. The CAG had in 2011 questioned the rationale behind the government’s decision to order 111 airplanes for AI and Indian Airlines — 48 from Airbus and 68 from Boeing — for about Rs 70,000 crore in 2006. Calling the decision a “recipe for disaster”, the government auditor had said it should have raised “alarm” in the Ministry of Civil Aviation, Public Investment Board and The Planning Commission. The second case pertains to leasing of a large number of aircraft without due consideration, proper route study and marketing or price strategy, he said. “It was also alleged that the aircraft were leased even while aircraft acquisition programme was going on,” he said. The third case involves allegations of surrender of profitable routes and timings of Air India to favour national and international private players which allegedly caused a “huge” loss to the state-run carrier. In its report on the merger of Air India and Indian Airlines, the CAG had called it “ill-timed”. Now the CBI will go into various aspects of the merger. The government auditor had said,”The financial case for the merger was not adequately validated prior to the merger.” The merger proposal had received the Manmohan Singh cabinet’s approval on March 1, 2007. The CBI’s action follows the Supreme Court’s January 5 direction on a petition filed by the Centre for Public Interest Litigation led by lawyer Prashant Bhushan. CBI sources said “all stakeholders” were under its scanner with regard to the merger of the two state-run airlines. The process for the merger was initiated by the then Civil Aviation Minister Praful Patel of NCP on March 16, 2006. Patel had sought a concept paper on the merger and a presentation was made before the prime minister on March 22 that year. A Group of Ministers (GoM) had later examined the proposal. Indian Airlines officially merged with Air India in April 2007. The current Air India Chairman-cum-Managing Director Ashwani Lohani had recently said the merger was behind Air India’s “downfall“. Finance Minister Arun Jaitley had on Saturday favoured disinvestment of Air India, saying the airline’s market share was just around 14 per cent whereas its debt burden stood at a staggering Rs 50,000 crore.

 YOUR E-MAIL VERIFICATION CODE An MS-21 medium-range passenger plane, produced by Irkut Corporation, takes off in Irkutsk, Russia, May 28, 2017. (Reuters Photo) Russia carried out the maiden flight of its new MS-21 medium-range passenger plane on Sunday, its first post-Soviet foray into production of a mainline commercial aircraft which it hopes will rival those of its Western competitors. In a surprise statement, manufacturer Irkut Corporation and its state-controlled parent company United Aircraft Corporation (UAC) said an MS-21-300 model had successfully completed a 30-minute flight at a height of 1,000 meters and traveling at 300 km an hour. Squeezed by Western sanctions over its role in the Ukraine crisis, Russia is trying to rejuvenate domestic industrial production to make the country less dependent on foreign firms. The test flight, which was not announced to media beforehand, comes just three weeks after China staged the maiden flight of its new C919 passenger jet, highlighting the growing competition to industry heavyweights Boeing and Airbus. Russian officials have said the MS-21 is superior to its Western-made counterparts in many respects and will be snapped up by both Russian and foreign carriers, but Western analysts say both Russia and China face a huge challenge to shatter the transatlantic airplane duopoly. "The flight mission has been completed. The flight was fine, there were no observations which will prevent further testing," test pilot Oleg Kononenko was quoted as saying. Western aviation sources however expressed surprise at the flight's brevity and relatively low altitude compared with recent 3-4 hour debuts of North American and European models. "It suggests they either have severe limitations or may have had something happen and decided to come back," said a Western flight test engineer, speaking on condition of anonymity. A Western jet making source called it a "genteel flight". A UAC spokesman said the flight had been long enough to test everything that needed checking in the air. Russia has fought hard to shake off its Soviet reputation for old and creaking aircraft flown by inexperienced crews. Flag carrier Aeroflot last year earned its fourth star from independent ratings website Skytrax, ranking it alongside major European and Middle Eastern competitors and ahead of big U.S. carriers such as Delta and United. President Vladimir Putin called Irkut General Director Oleg Demchenko to congratulate him and his employees with what the Kremlin called "a significant event". The twin-engine MS-21 will be built in two variants: the MS-21-300 which will have 160-211 seats, and the later MS-21-200 which will have 130-165 seats. It is sometimes referred to as the MC-21 when using the Russian name and Cyrillic letters. Production is expected to start in the next two years and state media have said numerous contracts with domestic and foreign carriers have already been agreed. Irkut said it so far had "firm orders" for 175 planes. America's Boeing and Europe's Airbus remain far ahead of their Chinese and Russian rivals, with bigger sales books and more advanced technical know-how. But the new plane could win sales in Russia and some eastern European and Asian countries, industry analysts say, with buyers attracted by its lower running costs. Irkut said operational costs for its new plane will be up to 15 percent cheaper than current generation aircraft. With a range of up to 6,000 kilometers, the MS-21 will be competing against the Boeing 737 and Airbus A320 aircraft which currently dominate the medium-range narrow-body market. Both companies recently upgraded those families to achieve comparable 15 percent operational savings compared to previous versions. State defense conglomerate Rostec, which is headed by close Putin ally Sergei Chemezov, said it had agreed to purchase 85 aircraft. At least 50 of them will be leased to Aeroflot, Rostec said, which currently operates a fleet dominated by narrow-body Airbus models, including 70 A320s. UAC President Yury Slyusar said he estimated global demand for the new MS-21 models at around 15,000 aircraft over the next 20 years.

In a surprise statement, manufacturer Irkut Corporation and its state-controlled parent company United Aircraft Corporation (UAC) said an MS-21-300 model had successfully completed a 30-minute flight at a height of 1,000 metres and travelling at 300 km an hour. Squeezed by Western sanctions over its role in the Ukraine crisis, Russia is trying to rejuvenate domestic industrial production to make the country less dependant on foreign firms. The test flight, which was not announced to media beforehand, comes just three weeks after China staged the maiden flight of its new C919 passenger jet, highlighting the growing competition to industry heavyweights Boeing and Airbus. Russian officials have said the MS-21 is superior to its Western-made counterparts in many respects and will be snapped up by both Russian and foreign carriers, but Western analysts say both Russia and China face a huge challenge to shatter the transatlantic airplane duopoly. “The flight mission has been completed. The flight was fine, there were no observations which will prevent further testing,” test pilot Oleg Kononenko was quoted as saying. Western aviation sources however expressed surprise at the flight’s brevity and relatively low altitude compared with recent 3-4 hour debuts of North American and European models. “It suggests they either have severe limitations or may have had something happen and decided to come back,” said a Western flight test engineer, speaking on condition of anonymity. A Western jetmaking source called it a “genteel flight”. A UAC spokesman said the flight had been long enough to test everything that needed checking in the air. Russia has fought hard to shake off its Soviet reputation for old and creaking aircraft flown by inexperienced crews. Flag carrier Aeroflot last year earned its fourth star from independent ratings website Skytrax, ranking it alongside major European and Middle Eastern competitors and ahead of big U.S. carriers such as Delta and United. FIRM ORDERS President Vladimir Putin called Irkut General Director Oleg Demchenko to congratulate him and his employees with what the Kremlin called “a significant event”. The twin-engine MS-21 will be built in two variants: the MS-21-300 which will have 160-211 seats, and the later MS-21-200 which will have 130-165 seats. It is sometimes referred to as the MC-21 when using the Russian name and Cyrillic letters. Production is expected to start in the next two years and state media have said numerous contracts with domestic and foreign carriers have already been agreed. Irkut said it so far had “firm orders” for 175 planes. America’s Boeing and Europe’s Airbus remain far ahead of their Chinese and Russian rivals, with bigger sales books and more advanced technical know-how. But the new plane could win sales in Russia and some eastern European and Asian countries, industry analysts say, with buyers attracted by its lower running costs. Irkut said operational costs for its new plane will be up to 15% cheaper than current generation aircraft. With a range of up to 6,000 kilometres, the MS-21 will be competing against the Boeing 737 and Airbus A320 aircraft which currently dominate the medium-range narrow-body market. Both companies recently upgraded those families to achieve comparable 15% operational savings compared to previous versions. State defence conglomerate Rostec, which is headed by close Putin ally Sergei Chemezov, said it had agreed to purchase 85 aircraft. At least 50 of them will be leased to Aeroflot, Rostec said, which currently operates a fleet dominated by narrow-body Airbus models, including 70 A320s. UAC President Yury Slyusar said he estimated global demand for the new MS-21 models at around 15,000 aircraft over the next 20 years. “I’m sure the airlines will appreciate our new aircraft,” he said. more from business GST will help in evolving India as tax-compliant society, Jaitley says May 29, 2017 16:43 IST Ford EcoSport, Figo, Aspire cheaper by up to Rs 30,000 ahead of GST May 29, 2017 16:34 IST Red Alert – Rising cases of student suicides sound alarm bells across India Partnered Feature Recommended for you Read more Who will buy Air India?

In a surprise statement, manufacturer Irkut Corporation and its state-controlled parent company United Aircraft Corporation (UAC) said an MS-21-300 model had successfully completed a 30-minute flight at a height of 1,000 metres and travelling at 300 km an hour. Squeezed by Western sanctions over its role in the Ukraine crisis, Russia is trying to rejuvenate domestic industrial production to make the country less dependant on foreign firms. The test flight, which was not announced to media beforehand, comes just three weeks after China staged the maiden flight of its new C919 passenger jet, highlighting the growing competition to industry heavyweights Boeing and Airbus . Russian officials have said the MS-21 is superior to its Western-made counterparts in many respects and will be snapped up by both Russian and foreign carriers, but Western analysts say both Russia and China face a huge challenge to shatter the transatlantic airplane duopoly. "The flight mission has been completed. The flight was fine, there were no observations which will prevent further testing," test pilot Oleg Kononenko was quoted as saying. Western aviation sources however expressed surprise at the flight's brevity and relatively low altitude compared with recent 3-4 hour debuts of North American and European models. "It suggests they either have severe limitations or may have had something happen and decided to come back," said a Western flight test engineer, speaking on condition of anonymity. A Western jetmaking source called it a "genteel flight". A UAC spokesman said the flight had been long enough to test everything that needed checking in the air. Russia has fought hard to shake off its Soviet reputation for old and creaking aircraft flown by inexperienced crews. Flag carrier Aeroflot last year earned its fourth star from independent ratings website Skytrax, ranking it alongside major European and Middle Eastern competitors and ahead of big US carriers such as Delta and United. FIRM ORDERS President Vladimir Putin called Irkut General Director Oleg Demchenko to congratulate him and his employees with what the Kremlin called "a significant event". The twin-engine MS-21 will be built in two variants: the MS-21-300 which will have 160-211 seats, and the later MS-21-200 which will have 130-165 seats. It is sometimes referred to as the MC-21 when using the Russian name and Cyrillic letters. Production is expected to start in the next two years and state media have said numerous contracts with domestic and foreign carriers have already been agreed. Irkut said it so far had "firm orders" for 175 planes. America's Boeing and Europe's Airbus remain far ahead of their Chinese and Russian rivals, with bigger sales books and more advanced technical know-how. But the new plane could win sales in Russia and some eastern European and Asian countries, industry analysts say, with buyers attracted by its lower running costs. Irkut said operational costs for its new plane will be up to 15 percent cheaper than current generation aircraft. With a range of up to 6,000 kilometres, the MS-21 will be competing against the Boeing 737 and Airbus A320 aircraft which currently dominate the medium-range narrow-body market. Both companies recently upgraded those families to achieve comparable 15 percent operational savings compared to previous versions. State defence conglomerate Rostec, which is headed by close Putin ally Sergei Chemezov, said it had agreed to purchase 85 aircraft. At least 50 of them will be leased to Aeroflot, Rostec said, which currently operates a fleet dominated by narrow-body Airbus models, including 70 A320s. UAC President Yury Slyusar said he estimated global demand for the new MS-21 models at around 15,000 aircraft over the next 20 years. "I'm sure the airlines will appreciate our new aircraft," he said.     Copyright Reuters, 2017  Twitter Facebook Google+ Pinterest LinkedIn Tumblr Mail Print the author Shoaib Ur Rehman Siddiqui Previous EU ministers agree car approval rules after dieselgate Next Palm hits one-month low on falling demand, technical selling Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

European plane makers who import US-made parts fear this will endanger the multi-billion dollar deals they have done there. By Thomas Jahn and Jens Koenen Published on 29.

Source: Airbus It was only a couple of sentences but they were enough to cause a major amount of concern in the aerospace industry. In a hearing, US Treasury Secretary, Steven Mnuchin announced his intention to impose additional sanctions not only on Syria and North Korea, but also on Iran. Then he added, “both in the case of Boeing and Airbus, there are licenses that will be required and they are under review.” A lot of money is at stake. Airbus has an order from Iran Air for 32 A320neo-s, six A320ceo-s, eight A321ceo-s, eight A330—200s, 28 A330—900neo-s and 16 A350—1000s. And a lot of money will continue to be at stake: As one Airbus press release put it, on the delivery of the first of the Airbus A321s to Iran in January this year: “Iran is forecast to require some 400 to 500 new aircraft to modernize as well as to grow its existing passenger fleet to catch up with years of pent up demand on domestic as well as international routes.” Want to keep reading?

New jet quietly makes maiden flight in bid to rival Airbus and Boeing The passenger jet's test flight on Sunday was not announced to the media. By India Ashok May 29, 2017 07:07 BST The MS-21 successfully completed a 300minute flight, flying at 300km an hour at an altitude of 1,000mIrkut Corporation Russia quietly launched a new medium-range passenger jet, the MS-21, on Sunday (28 May), which it hopes will boost its aviation industry. The jet, which is Russia's first attempt into the production of a commercial jet since the Soviet era, carries the hopes of the nation in rivalling aviation giants like Boeing and Airbus. The aircraft made its first flight from the Siberian city of Irkutsk, the base of the jet's manufacturer the Irkut Corporation. Russian deputy prime minister Dmitry Rogozin took to Twitter to announce the maiden flight, writing "Our swallow learned to fly." Irkut said in a statement that the MS-21 successfully completed a 30-minute flight, flying at 300km an hour at an altitude of 1,000m. Russian president Vladimir Putin's press secretary told state media Tass that Rogozin informed Putin of the aircraft's successful flight over the phone. The jet's test flight was not announced to the media and comes on the heels of China testing its new passenger jet C919, indicating the growing competition in the aviation industry. According to the aircraft's manufacturers, the MS-21 can carry up to 211 passengers and travel for up to 6,000km. Irkut said that the twin-engine aircraft will come in two versions, one which can seat around 211 passengers and another which will hold up to 165 passengers. Putin reportedly reached out to Irkut's director Oleg Demchenko to congratulate him on the "momentous occasion". Although the jet's manufacturer claimed that the aircraft was "superior to existing counterparts in terms of flight-technical characteristics and efficiency," Western aviation experts were surprised at the parameters of the test flight, in terms of the low altitude and the brief duration of the flight. Reuters cited an unspecified jet maker as deeming the MS-21 as a "genteel flight".

In a surprise statement, manufacturer Irkut Corporation and its state-controlled parent company United Aircraft Corporation (UAC) said an MS-21-300 model had successfully completed a 30-minute flight at a height of 1,000 metres and travelling at 300 km an hour. Squeezed by Western sanctions over its role in the Ukraine crisis, Russia is trying to rejuvenate domestic industrial production to make the country less dependant on foreign firms. The test flight, which was not announced to media beforehand, comes just three weeks after China staged the maiden flight of its new C919 passenger jet, highlighting the growing competition to industry heavyweights Boeing and Airbus. Russian officials have said the MS-21 is superior to its Western-made counterparts in many respects and will be snapped up by both Russian and foreign carriers, but Western analysts say both Russia and China face a huge challenge to shatter the transatlantic airplane duopoly. "The flight mission has been completed. The flight was fine, there were no observations which will prevent further testing," test pilot Oleg Kononenko was quoted as saying. Western aviation sources, however, expressed surprise at the flight's brevity and relatively low altitude compared with recent 3-4 hour debuts of North American and European models. "It suggests they either have severe limitations or may have had something happen and decided to come back," said a Western flight test engineer, speaking on condition of anonymity. A Western jetmaking source called it a "genteel flight." A UAC spokesman said the flight had been long enough to test everything that needed checking in the air. Russia has fought hard to shake off its Soviet reputation for old and creaking aircraft flown by inexperienced crews. Flag carrier Aeroflot last year earned its fourth star from independent ratings website Skytrax, ranking it alongside major European and Middle Eastern competitors and ahead of big US carriers such as Delta and United. Firm orders President Vladimir Putin called Irkut General Director Oleg Demchenko to congratulate him and his employees with what the Kremlin called "a significant event." The twin-engine MS-21 will be built in two variants: The MS-21-300 which will have 160-211 seats, and the later MS-21-200 which will have 130-165 seats. It is sometimes referred to as the MC-21 when using the Russian name and Cyrillic letters. Production is expected to start in the next two years and state media have said numerous contracts with domestic and foreign carriers have already been agreed. Irkut said it so far had "firm orders" for 175 planes. America's Boeing and Europe's Airbus remain far ahead of their Chinese and Russian rivals, with bigger sales books and more advanced technical know-how. But the new plane could win sales in Russia and some eastern European and Asian countries, industry analysts say, with buyers attracted by its lower running costs. Irkut said operational costs for its new plane will be up to 15 per cent cheaper than current generation aircraft. With a range of up to 6,000 kilometres, the MS-21 will be competing against the Boeing 737 and Airbus A320 aircraft which currently dominate the medium-range narrow-body market. Both companies recently upgraded those families to achieve comparable 15 per cent operational savings compared to previous versions. State defence conglomerate Rostec, which is headed by close Putin ally Sergei Chemezov, said it had agreed to purchase 85 aircraft. At least 50 of them will be leased to Aeroflot, Rostec said, which currently operates a fleet dominated by narrow-body Airbus models, including 70 A320s. UAC President Yury Slyusar said he estimated global demand for the new MS-21 models at around 15,000 aircraft over the next 20 years. "I'm sure the airlines will appreciate our new aircraft," he said. — Reuters                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week 1MDB probe: MAS fines Credit Suisse, UOB, seeks more trading bans (VIDEO) Ringgit continues downtrend due to soft demand KL shares turn mixed at mid-morning Tokyo shares slip, Trump-Russia probe in focus Oil rises second day as Opec cuts seen bringing stockpiles lower Singapore court fines ex-broker for corruption in 1MDB probe Chinese automaker Geely takes 49.9pc stake in Proton Ringgit jumps on Opec, yuan at three-month high, other Asian currencies drift Meet Li Shufu, the man who dared buy Proton Chinese carmaker Geely to acquire Malaysia’s Proton, sources say Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: One Direction's Styles tops Billboard with solo album Bloomberg Video: Singapore fines Credit Suisse, UOB over 1MDB Reuters Video: Tiger Woods arrested for driving under the influence Reuters Video: Thai man murders baby, commits suicide on Facebook Live Reuters Video: Cast and crew of ‘The Beguiled’ discuss the remake Tilda Swinton unveils strange ‘Okja’ promo clip Related Articles Russia unveils new passenger plane it says will rival Boeing Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2017 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | recommend.my - Local Services

Ryanair said it posted a EUR1.32 billion ($1.47 billion) net profit for the financial year ended March 31 against a target range of EUR1.3 billion to EUR1.35 billion. Sales last year advanced 2% to EUR6.65 billion as the airline carried 120 million passengers. The airline also kicked off a EUR600 million share buyback to be completed by the end of October, having completed a EUR1 billion stock-repurchase round in February. Ryanair said it has returned EUR5.4 billion to investors since 2008 through a series of buybacks and special dividends. Europe's largest airline by passenger numbers also said profit would rise further this year and reach EUR1.4 billion to EUR1.45 billion. Ryanair typically begins the year with conservative profit forecasts. It said much of the increase in profit should come from a projected EUR70 million fall in fuel costs. The carrier also expects to carry 130 million passengers by the end of March 2018. European airlines are preparing for a stronger financial performance this year as a glut of seats for sale eases and economies broadly pick up. That reduces the need to sharply discount tickets--an earnings headwind in recent years. British Airways parent International Consolidated Airlines Group SA said its ticket prices may rise this quarter, the first time in three years. Central East European budget Wizz Air last week said ticket prices have stabilized earlier than expected. Ryanair said bookings for the six months to Sept. 30 are ahead of last year, though the slump of the British currency after the Brexit vote is expected to lead to a 5% to 7% decline in average ticket prices for the full financial year. The company generates more than a quarter of its sales in sterling. Fares fell 13% in the prior financial year. Ryanair has delivered strong earnings growth in recent years by rapidly expanding while maintaining low costs. Nonfuel unit costs are expected to fall 1% this year. The Dublin-based airline also said it was preparing for more aggressive growth through a fleet review with plane provider Boeing Co. The size of its fleet should increase in the 2018 and 2019 period by extending leases on 10 existing planes and picking up delivery slots for new aircraft, it said. "We are aware of the need to have additional short-haul aircraft to," Ryanair said. The carrier has been growing aggressively in Germany, where Air Berlin PLC is retrenching, and is a major player in Italy, where flag carrier Alitalia has entered the equivalent of bankruptcy protection. But Ryanair also is starting to branch out in other ways. This month it said it was starting to sell long-haul tickets for Spanish carrier Air Europa. The Irish airline also is in talks with others, including Norwegian Air Shuttle ASA and IAG's Aer Lingus, to provide feeder traffic to those airlines' international service.

Work for this deal is scheduled to be over by Nov 30, 2017. Valued at $39.1 million, the contract was awarded by the U.S. Army Contracting Command, Fort Eustis, VA. Fiscal 2017 operations and maintenance funds will be utilized to perform the work, which will be executed in Fort Leavenworth, KS. A Brief Note on Army Training & Northrop Northrop provides integrated training services, innovative training technologies and subject-matter experts to the U.S. as well as its allied military forces. Mission training includes mission rehearsal, exercises, doctrine development, instruction, curriculum development and virtual constructive-simulations training. Built on decades of experience, Northrop is at the forefront of developing and field-training solutions for the U.S. Army. Its products and services help train soldiers for full-spectrum operations worldwide. The significant mission-training programs offered by the company to the U.S. Army include the DD J7 Joint & Coalition Warfighting (JCW), Mission Command Training Program, Mission Command Training Support program (MCTSP) and III Corps Mission Command Training Center. Our View Northrop’s Technology Services segment is a leading global logistics and sustainment provider, which supports the entire life cycle of civil and defense platforms and capabilities through a range of services, including providing mission readiness and training. Notably, the company is witnessing robust domestic and international opportunities across its three sectors under the Technology Services segment. Toward this end, Northrop continues to pursue a range of programs, including international opportunities in Australia and the Middle East as well as sustaining opportunities for its international Global Hawks. Recently, the company started working as an integrated subcontractor to diversified conglomerate — Honeywell International Inc. HON — for the management and operations of Sandia National Laboratories. This, along with contract wins like the aforementioned ones, tends to bolster the service volume for the company, which, in turn, is expected to boost its growth trajectory, going ahead. Price Performance Northrop’s stock has gained 19.9% in the last one year, underperforming the Zacks categorized Aerospace–Defense industry’s gain of 25.7%. This could be due to higher operating expenses continuing to partially impact Northrop’s profit margin. Furthermore, in a highly competitive environment, customers might get attracted to similar products offered by its peers at a lower price, which remains a major concern. Northrop faces tough competition from rivals like The Boeing Company BA and General Dynamics Corp. GD, both of which outperformed the broader industry’s gain in the last one year.

First Name Last Name Email Postal Code Subscribe to feed Share on Facebook Share on Twitter ShareEmail  Print By the time Air Force One started down the runaway at Naval Air Station Sigonella in Sicily, to bring President Trump home, the Atlantic had grown markedly wider than it was when he flew to Riyadh. In a Munich beer hall Sunday, Angela Merkel confirmed it. Europe must begin to look out for itself, she said, “take our fate into our own hands. … The times in which we could rely fully on others, they are somewhat over.” Merkel’s apprehensions are understandable. A divorce could be in the cards. During his visit to NATO in Brussels and the G-7 in Sicily, Trump, with both his words and body language, revealed his thinking on who are friends and who are freeloaders. Long before arriving, Trump had cheered Brexit, the British decision to quit the EU, and shown a preference for nationalist Marine Le Pen in the French election won handily by Emmanuel Macron. But when it comes to leaders, Trump seems to prefer Deke House to student council types. He has hailed Vladimir Putin as a “strong ruler” and “very smart.” In Riyadh, Trump declared King Salman a “wise man.” He calls China’s Xi Jinping “a great guy” and welcomed Turkish autocrat Recep Tayyip Erdogan to the Oval Office: “It is a great honor to have you with us.” When Egypt’s President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi, who has imprisoned and killed thousands of the Muslim Brotherhood, came to visit, Trump said, “He’s done a fantastic job in a very difficult situation.” Like the reporting you see here? Sign up for free news alerts from WND.com, America’s independent news network. In a phone call, Trump also praised Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte, who has had narcotics dealers gunned down in the streets, for doing an “unbelievable job on the drug problem.” Trump has even found merit in Kim Jong-un, the 33-year-old dictator of North Korea, describing him as a “a pretty smart cookie.” And where Trump was photographed by the Russians grinning broadly with Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, his confab with Merkel was marked by a seeming reluctance to shake hands. But the disagreements with Europe are deeper than matters of style. Trump and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson have indicated that in dealing with foreign nations, U.S. support for democratic norms and human rights will now take a back seat to strategic interests. In Riyadh, Trump signaled the Sunni king of Bahrain we will no longer be giving him instructions on how to treat his Shiite majority. We’re not “here to lecture,” Trump assured the Arab royals. After the conclave, the king’s police killed five and wounded dozens of demonstrators outside the home of a Shiite cleric, and arrested 286 of his supporters. Of greater concern to Trump and Tillerson is the retention of the Persian Gulf naval base of the U.S. 5th Fleet in Bahrain. Trump also tilts toward GOP skepticism of the threat of global warming and is considering pulling out of the Paris climate accord that is the altarpiece of the environmentalist international. In Brussels, Trump praised NATO’s decision to back the U.S. war in Afghanistan after 9/11, but did not specifically recommit to Article 5, requiring all NATO nations to treat an attack on one as an attack on all, which our nervous NATO allies had wanted to hear. Instead, they got an earful of pure Trump about how they owed back pay for NATO and that only five NATO nations were meeting their obligation to allocate 2 percent of GDP to defense. Merkel seemed to take this as an implied threat that the U.S commitment to defend Europe from a Russia with one-tenth of NATO-Europe’s GDP may be contingent and may have a time limit on it. Moreover, France, Britain and Germany appear far more solidly committed to the Iran nuclear deal than are Trump and Congress. A U.S.-NATO collision could come here, and soon. The Iranians have signed on to purchase 100 Airbus aircraft and 80 commercial airliners from Boeing. If the Republicans impose new sanctions on Iran, or scupper the Boeing deal, Europe would have to decide whether to abandon the Airbus sales, or deliver the planes and perhaps take over the Boeing contract. That could bring a crisis. And any U.S. confrontation with Iran, pressed upon us by Saudis, Israelis and Sunni Arabs could find Europeans bailing out wholesale on the next U.S. war in the Middle East. Trump also seems less committed to the sanctions on Russia for its reannexation of Ukraine and support of pro-Russian rebels in the Donbass than does NATO Europe or Congress. From his rough remarks, Trump sees the Europeans as freeloaders on U.S. defense, laggards on their NATO contributions and mercantilists who craft policies to run endless trade surpluses at our expense, especially the Germans who are “bad, very bad.” The European half of Trump’s trip should be taken as a fire-bell-in-the-night warning: Shape up, Europe, or you may find yourselves on your own when it comes to the defense of your continent. For we Americans have had about enough.

Research and Markets News provided by Research and Markets 29 May, 2017, 17:30 BST Share this article DUBLIN, May 29, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Research and Markets has announced the addition of the "Global Aircraft Tire Market 2017-2021" report to their offering. The global aircraft tire market to grow at a CAGR of 4.75% during the period 2017-2021. The report covers the present scenario and the growth prospects of the global aircraft tire market for 2017-2021. To calculate the market size, the report considers the revenue generated in the overall market from the procurement of new tires (for new aircraft) as well as the retreading or replacement of existing tires. The report also includes a discussion of the key vendors operating in this market. One trend in market is emergence of green aircraft taxiing systems. Aircraft taxiing involves the movement of aircraft on the ground under its own engine power, which burns a significant amount of fuel. An Airbus A320 aircraft uses approximately 600 liters of fuel while taxiing for an average of 3.5 hours a day. This has necessitated the adoption of alternative approaches for taxiing an aircraft. A number of stakeholders have directed their efforts in developing alternative hybrid or electrically driven approaches to mitigate the excessive fuel consumption and emission impact during taxiing aircraft. According to the report, one driver in market is rise in aircraft retrofitting. There are many aircraft that have been in service for a long time across the globe. These aircraft require periodic component retrofitting for optimal functioning. Landing gear components, including tires and braking systems, need periodical replacements to keep an aircraft in optimum working condition, as well as to enhance the operational efficiency of aircraft landing gear systems. Retrofitting of landing gears would play greater importance in the growth of the global aircraft tire market, especially for the radial tires segment. Further, the report states that one challenge in market is dominance of OEMs and landing gear suppliers in dictating contract conditions. The high bargaining power of any single stakeholder is not a positive sign for any industry. Boeing and Airbus being the two major streamlined aircraft OEMs retain supremacy on finalizing the prices of aircraft tires for their respective aircraft. Also, major landing gear suppliers, such as General Electric (GE) and United Technologies Corporation (UTC), exercise control over structuring the overall features and prices of landing gear systems, which include tires along with other components.  Key vendors Bridgestone Dunlop Aircraft Tyres Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company Michelin Aircraft Tyre Key Topics Covered: Part 01: Executive summary Part 02: Scope of the report Part 03: Market research methodology Part 04: Introduction Part 05: Market landscape Part 06: Market segmentation by tire type Part 07: Market segmentation by end-user Part 08: Geographical segmentation Part 09: Market drivers Part 10: Impact of drivers Part 11: Market challenges Part 12: Impact of drivers and challenges Part 13: Market trends Part 14: Vendor landscape Part 15: Appendix For more information about this report visit http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/z3qx8v/global_aircraft Media Contact: Research and Markets Laura Wood, Senior Manager press@researchandmarkets.com For E.S.T Office Hours Call +1-917-300-0470 For U.S./CAN Toll Free Call +1-800-526-8630 For GMT Office Hours Call +353-1-416-8900 U.S. Fax: 646-607-1907 Fax (outside U.S.): +353-1-481-1716   SOURCE Research and Markets Related Links http://www.researchandmarkets.com 29 May, 2017, 17:40 BST Preview: Research and Markets - Global Western Blotting (Gel Electrophoresis, Blotting Systems, Imagers, Consumables) Market 2014-2017 & 2025: Focus on Biomedical & Biochemical Research & Disease Diagnostics 29 May, 2017, 17:20 BST Preview: Research and Markets - Renal Cluster Drug Development Pipeline Review 2017 - Key Companies are Angion Biomedica, Apceth Biopharma, AstraZeneca, Bayer, Evotec, Novartis, Sarfez Pharmaceuticals & Vidasym My News Release contains wide tables.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 29 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Lockheed Wins $44M Navy Deal for Trident II Support Services Shutterstock photo Lockheed Martin Corp. ‚s LMT business unit, Space Systems Co., has won a modification contract from the U.S. Navy to offer support services for the production of Trident II (D5) missile and D5 deployed systems. Contract Details The contract is valued at $43.9 million. It was awarded by Strategic Systems Programs, Washington, D.C. Work is scheduled to be complete by Sep 30, 2017. The majority of the work will be performed in Sunnyvale, CA, while the rest will be executed in Cape Canaveral, FL and other locations across the U.S. The contract will use fiscal 2017 operations and maintenance (Navy) funds. A Brief Note on Trident II (D5) Trident II (D5) is the latest generation of the Navy’s submarine-launched fleet ballistic missiles, developed and produced by Lockheed Martin. It was first deployed in 1990 and is currently aboard the OHIO-class and British VANGUARD-class submarines. These missiles are equipped with multiple independently targetable reentry vehicles (MIRV) and armed with thermonuclear warheads. What’s Favoring Lockheed? Lockheed Martin’s Space Systems Co. is the prime contractor of the Navy’s Trident missile. The company also supplies technical and logistical support at sites where the missiles are deployed. In Sep 2016, the Navy had launched an unarmed Trident II D5 Fleet Ballistic Missile, following which the company announced that it is building on a 60-year partnership with the Navy. The declaration was made to ensure that the missile system remains capable for decades ahead through the company’s shared robust flight test plan. Naturally, the latest contract is expected to boost the company’s business substantially.  It may even attract more of such contracts in the future, given that Trident II (D5) has one of the top priorities in the U.S. Navy’s missile system. Price Movement Lockheed Martin’s stock was up about 17.5% in the last one year, underperforming the Zacks categorized Aerospace/Defense industry’s gain of 25.7%. This could be because the earlier budget cuts have put pressure on the top line although the present defense budget is more in favor of the sector. We believe that budget deficits and political uncertainty might make future defense budgets vulnerable to cutbacks. Furthermore, the stock’s performance lagged compared with that of Boeing Co. BA , General Dynamics Corp. GD and Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. HII , which surpassed the industry mark. Zacks Rank Lockheed Martin currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here . Looking for Ideas with Even Greater Upside? Today’s investment ideas are short-term, directly based on our proven 1 to 3 month indicator. In addition, I invite you to consider our long-term opportunities.

The economic slowdown witnessed across major economies around the world also had an adverse impact on the market.

Pence, joined by his wife, Second Lady Karen Pence, and Veterans Affairs Secretary David Shulkin, hosted Project Hero at the Vice President’s residence before the bikers began their route from Washington D.C. to Virginia Beach. “It’s written if you owe debts, pay debts; if honor, then honor; if respect, then respect,” Pence said behind a vice presidential podium. “This is a day we remember those who serve and did not come home — and to be able to welcome you heroes here, all of you, who have worn the uniform of the United States, and some law enforcement, and have borne the burdens that come with that service.” Pence added: “To be able to welcome you here on the most hallow of days is profoundly humbling to Karen and I.” Project Hero is a national nonprofit organization dedicated to helping veterans and first responders affected by posttraumatic stress disorder, traumatic brain injury, and injury achieve rehabilitation, recovery and resilience in their daily lives. The organization’s Memorial Day bike ride, “2017 Unitedhealthcare Memorial Challenge,” was presented by Boeing. “Karen and I are jealous — we’re bikers! We’d love to ride with you,” said Pence, greeted by laughter and applause. “Especially the first five miles that are all downhill.” Pence touted President Trump’s “extraordinary” first overseas trip as commander-in-chief, and the administration’s dedication to veterans and military men and women, and cited a statistic that more than 1 in 5 veterans have PTSD. “It’s Memorial Day 2017 — their duty was to serve, our duty is to remember,” Pence said. “It is the greatest privilege of my life to be the vice president to a president who cares so deeply about the men and women of our armed forces and veterans of the United States —  Donald Trump.” Pence also thanked Shulkin for his efforts in “fighting tirelessly” to give the veterans of the United States the “healthcare they’ve earned, and deserve, in uniform,”  and noted an executive order signed by President Trump last month dedicated to improving accountability within the Department of Veterans Affairs. “We wish you Godspeed and safe travels all the way to Virginia Beach, and Project Hero, all the way to a full recovery in an America that cherishes all who serve,” Pence said. Second Lady Karen Pence delivered a prayer to the bikers, and joked: “Don’t forget all these oranges and bananas before you leave!”  Brooke Singman is a Reporter for Fox News.

Atir Khan  | Edited by Nikhil Agarwal  Follow @atirwkhan   atir.khan@aajtak.com New Delhi, May 29, 2017 | UPDATED 19:59 IST A +A - Highlights 1 Affairs of the civil aviation ministry during UPA will be probed 2 FIRs filed on purchase of 111 aircrafts and leasing of places 3 A CAG report had pointed out irregularities The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has registered a preliminary enquiry to probe irregularities in the merger of Air India and Indian Airlines. The CBI has alleged that the merger of the two government-owned airlines caused losses of thousands of crores of rupees. Three first information reports (FIRs) to enquire about the purchase of 111 aircrafts, leasing of planes and the giving up of profit-making routes by Air India have also been filed. The agency will also probe affairs of the civil aviation ministry during the earlier UPA regime. Issues include purchase of 50 Boeing aircraft for Air India and handing over of lucrative international airline routes to private airlines. Agency sources said the cases are built around a CAG report submitted to the Parliament in 2011 and later to Parliamentary Accounts Committee. Both reports pointed out irregularities in the acquisition process which may have led to losses. Earlier this year the Supreme Court had also asked the CBI to complete the probe by June.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 29 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Northrop Wins Deal to Support Mission Training of U.S. Army Shutterstock photo Defense giant Northrop Grumman Corp. ‚s NOC business segment, Technology Services recently secured a modification contract to support the collective training of Army units in accordance with the Army Force Generation process. Work for this deal is scheduled to be over by Nov 30, 2017. Valued at $39.1 million, the contract was awarded by the U.S. Army Contracting Command, Fort Eustis, VA. Fiscal 2017 operations and maintenance funds will be utilized to perform the work, which will be executed in Fort Leavenworth, KS. A Brief Note on Army Training & Northrop Northrop provides integrated training services, innovative training technologies and subject-matter experts to the U.S. as well as its allied military forces. Mission training includes mission rehearsal, exercises, doctrine development, instruction, curriculum development and virtual constructive-simulations training. Built on decades of experience, Northrop is at the forefront of developing and field-training solutions for the U.S. Army. Its products and services help train soldiers for full-spectrum operations worldwide. The significant mission-training programs offered by the company to the U.S. Army include the DD J7 Joint & Coalition Warfighting (JCW), Mission Command Training Program, Mission Command Training Support program (MCTSP) and III Corps Mission Command Training Center. Our View Northrop’s Technology Services segment is a leading global logistics and sustainment provider, which supports the entire life cycle of civil and defense platforms and capabilities through a range of services, including providing mission readiness and training. Notably, the company is witnessing robust domestic and international opportunities across its three sectors under the Technology Services segment. Toward this end, Northrop continues to pursue a range of programs, including international opportunities in Australia and the Middle East as well as sustaining opportunities for its international Global Hawks. Recently, the company started working as an integrated subcontractor to diversified conglomerate – Honeywell International Inc. HON – for the management and operations of Sandia National Laboratories. This, along with contract wins like the aforementioned ones, tends to bolster the service volume for the company, which, in turn, is expected to boost its growth trajectory, going ahead. Price Performance Northrop’s stock has gained 19.9% in the last one year, underperforming the Zacks categorized Aerospace-Defense industry’s gain of 25.7%. This could be due to higher operating expenses continuing to partially impact Northrop’s profit margin. Furthermore, in a highly competitive environment, customers might get attracted to similar products offered by its peers at a lower price, which remains a major concern. Northrop faces tough competition from rivals like The Boeing Company BA and General Dynamics Corp. GD , both of which outperformed the broader industry’s gain in the last one year. Zacks Rank Northrop currently sports a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here . Looking for Ideas with Even Greater Upside? Today’s investment ideas are short-term, directly based on our proven 1 to 3 month indicator. In addition, I invite you to consider our long-term opportunities.

After three days together at a pair of meetings in Europe, Trudeau spent a press conference bobbing, weaving and ducking questions from reporters about his U.S. counterpart. The barrage of media queries came as the 43rd Group of Seven summit in Sicily ended with the U.S. president as an outlier. The final meeting communique had all leaders except Trump back the Paris climate accord and added new caveats aimed at appeasing the U.S. -- thanks in part to diplomacy and deft editing by Canada. Quotes in the article Boeing Co BA ▼ 186.59 -0.48 -0.26% Bombardier Inc BBD.A ▲ 2.40 +0.05 +2.13% AdChoices But while Germany’s Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron of France showed signs of frustration with the U.S. and Trump, Trudeau put on a happy face. He’s intent on playing peacemaker while confronting a growing list of disputes with his top trade partner in areas such as lumber, dairy and aerospace. And, given the dependence that Canada has on trade with its southern neighbor, he has a lot to lose. “I’m not going to lecture another country on what they should do, nor will I have my position determined by anyone outside of Canada,” Trudeau said when asked about Trump at a press conference Saturday in the seaside town of Taormina, Italy. “We share a very similar approach on a broad range of issues.” Trump officially set the table for new talks on the North American Free Trade Agreement when he notified Congress on May 18 that he intends to start renegotiating the 23-year-old deal binding the U.S., Canada and Mexico in 90 days. Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland joined Trudeau at the G-7 and said Canada would be focused on finding “common ground” with the U.S. on trade. Lumber Dispute In a 30-minute bilateral meeting on Saturday, Trump and Trudeau discussed trade but not Nafta specifically, said a Canadian government official speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss private deliberations. The Congressional notice period prevents Trump from discussing Nafta with Canadian and Mexico officials. Instead, the pair talked about softwood lumber, steel, aluminum and aerospace. In the latter case, Trudeau’s government is threatening to back out of a planned purchase of Boeing Co. fighter jets because of a trade case pending against Canada’s Bombardier Inc. Load Error Trump said in a Twitter post on Saturday, not long after meeting with Trudeau, that he’d “take major action if necessary” as his Commerce Department reviews whether steel and aluminum imports threaten national security. Through it all, Trudeau espoused a positive view of Trump. “We know that creating growth through trade in ways that benefits all our citizens is a priority we share,” Trudeau told reporters. “The approach that we need to strike fair, free, open, balanced trade is something we all share around the table.” ‘Fight Protectionism’ While the summit face-time yielded little on Nafta, it underscored Trump’s position -- and hinted at a change. The U.S. initially bristled at the inclusion of a pledge to oppose protectionism in the G-7’s joint release. Ultimately, though, the communique had leaders committing to “keep our markets open and to fight protectionism, while standing firm against all unfair trade practices.” Reflecting Trump’s view of the U.S. as the loser in many trade deals, it also noted that “trade has not always worked to the benefit of everyone.” The path forward for Trudeau is risky because no G-20 country does a larger share of its trade with the U.S. than Canada. Trudeau is weighing restrictions on shipments of American coal through Canadian ports in response to U.S. tariffs placed on its lumber. Canada has also pledged to fight the lumber duties -- imposed as part of a long-running dispute -- in court. The lumber spat is shaping up to take years, and Nafta talks could stretch into 2018, when they could be snagged by U.S. midterm elections and Mexico’s presidential vote. With Europe frustrated by Trump and lengthy battles shaping up, Trudeau is sticking with a pair of mantras: Freeland’s hunt for “common ground,” which was also the title of Trudeau’s 2015 autobiography, and “sunny ways,” the 45-year-old leader’s quasi-slogan of optimism from his winning campaign that year. “There’s always opportunities to do more on trade, always opportunities to improve trade deals,” Trudeau said on Saturday. “And that’s very much what we’re focused on.” Go to MSN Home Go to MSN Money Join the conversation Report Abuse Report inappropriate content Sorry!

Thao said she will meet exchange officials in New York later this week. The plan for the 41 trillion-dong (RM7.7 billion) low-cost carrier comes amid the government’s easing of rules to allow more foreign investment in one of the fastest-growing aviation markets. Hanoi-based VietJet, known for a marketing stunt featuring bikini-clad service crew, received shareholder approval in April to boost its foreign ownership limit to 49 per cent from 30 per cent. “Listing overseas on big markets will help increase our access to more fund sources, boost the trading of our stock and expand the list of our investors,” said Thao, a self-made billionaire. “We don’t want to hide our hope to become the first Vietnamese company to list shares overseas.” Shares of VietJet rose 0.8 per cent to 127,800 dong at the close in Ho Chi Minh City, the biggest gain in more than two weeks. The stock has surged about 51 per cent since it started trading three months ago, compared with a 6.4 per cent increase in the Bloomberg Asia Pacific Airlines Index. The overseas listing plan would make VietJet the first Vietnamese company to officially trade overseas, according to Tran Anh Dao, deputy chief executive of the Ho Chi Minh City Stock Exchange. While VietJet has done well in Vietnam, it faces tougher competition against entrenched players such as low-cost carrier AirAsia Bhd, as well as Cathay Pacific’s regional unit, Cathay Dragon, as it expands in Asia, said Tyler Cheung, director of institutional clients at ACB Securities Co in Ho Chi Minh City. “They have been able to accomplish something impressive in a relatively small period of time,” Cheung said. “The question is whether their business model and corporate strategy can transfer to a regional play.” Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Ltd doesn’t comment on individual companies, a spokeswoman said in an email. Singapore Exchange Ltd declined in an email to comment. VietJet, which began operating six years ago, has 136 foreign investors who own 26 per cent of the company, Thao, 46, said in April. She owns more than 60 per cent of the airline directly and through holding companies and other entities, according to filings. The increase in foreign ownership will need to be approved by Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc because aviation is considered a restricted industry, with the limit currently capped at 30 per cent. The airline has filed paperwork requesting the increase, Thao said. Raising the limit isn’t aimed at attracting a strategic investor, although the company is open to one, she said. “We always wanted to be the pioneer,” Thao said. “We want to increase our stock value and to boost the ability to mobilise capital with more participation of investors.” Thao made her first million dollars at age 21 selling fax machines and latex rubber. Almost a quarter of a century later, the executive became Southeast Asia’s first self-made woman billionaire with the listing of VietJet. Purchase negotiations Thao engages in round-the-clock negotiations with plane and engine makers by herself, surviving on as little as three hours of sleep a night, said VietJet Managing Director Luu Duc Khanh. In May last year, she sealed an US$11.3 billion (RM48.3 billion) deal with Boeing Co to buy 100 737 Max 200 aircraft just in time to have it announced during then-President Barack Obama’s visit to Vietnam. The carrier agreed to buy 30 A320neos valued at US$3.6 billion at list price in 2015, adding to an order for as many as 100 Airbus planes a year earlier. The budget airline forecasts profit will rise 36 per cent this year from 2.5 trillion dong in 2016. VietJet expects to serve 17 million passengers this year, after carrying about 15 million travellers in 2016. Its biggest competitor is Vietnam Airlines. The national carrier owns 70 per cent of low-cost operator Jetstar Pacific Airlines Aviation JSC, with Qantas Airways Ltd holding the remaining 30 per cent. Vietnam Airlines also owns Vietnam Air Services Co, known as Vasco. VietJet and Vietnam Airlines each have a 42 per cent share of the domestic aviation, said Brendan Sobie, a Singapore-based analyst at CAPA Centre for Aviation. VietJet’s share could rise to 50 per cent within three years, he said in April. “Vietnamese aviation is growing at a high rate,” Thao said. “When we open the door wider for foreign investors and create more opportunities for them, it also means we increase the chance for the local aviation industry and domestic stock market to expand and integrate faster into international aviation markets.” — Bloomberg                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week 1MDB probe: MAS fines Credit Suisse, UOB, seeks more trading bans (VIDEO) Ringgit continues downtrend due to soft demand KL shares turn mixed at mid-morning Tokyo shares slip, Trump-Russia probe in focus Oil rises second day as Opec cuts seen bringing stockpiles lower Singapore court fines ex-broker for corruption in 1MDB probe Chinese automaker Geely takes 49.9pc stake in Proton Ringgit jumps on Opec, yuan at three-month high, other Asian currencies drift Meet Li Shufu, the man who dared buy Proton Chinese carmaker Geely to acquire Malaysia’s Proton, sources say Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: One Direction's Styles tops Billboard with solo album Bloomberg Video: Singapore fines Credit Suisse, UOB over 1MDB Reuters Video: Tiger Woods arrested for driving under the influence Reuters Video: Thai man murders baby, commits suicide on Facebook Live Reuters Video: Cast and crew of ‘The Beguiled’ discuss the remake Tilda Swinton unveils strange ‘Okja’ promo clip Related Articles VietJet Air launches Hanoi-Siem Reap route VietJet Air seeks to proceed with US$1.2b listing Music convergence between Michael Learns to Rock and Wonder Girls for Vietjet’s fifth anniversary VietJet opens more domestic and foreign routes Vietjet launches another zero-fare promotion Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2017 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | recommend.my - Local Services

Disruption is the key to success. From mobile telephony to cab aggregators, a business model has always redefined the market and created winners. Indian airlines have been quite dull in that respect with dominant low-cost ones happy exploring the domestic market and short-haul international destinations. SpiceJet, on the verge of a shutdown two years ago, is now looking at joining a burgeoning global league of low-cost long-haul airlines by providing a Rs 30,000 to-and-fro fare to western European destinations. Chairman and managing director Ajay Singh elaborates. Excerpts: You think a low-cost model for long-haul routes is feasible for India? We feel there is huge demand for this. As the country becomes rich, personal incomes increase. Therefore, people want to travel. Today, most of the foreign travels from India are with foreign airlines, through hubs like West Asia. In India, we have a low-cost model. As people become rich, it is easier for them to take a flight abroad, provided the fares are low. Imagine the demand a fare of Rs 10,000-15,000 would have for a Delhi-London flight. Now, an airline has to make money while keeping the fares low. So, the cost, too, has to be low. We are looking at a model with which we can reduce the cost, so that we can bring down the fares drastically and still make money. How will an airline like SpiceJet bring down the cost? We are looking at various steps through which we can bring down the cost. Look, we can have a lot of economy seats. Therefore, increase the number of seats in the aircraft and bring down the cost per seat. It also depends on what kind of deals you get. We will look towards reducing the leasing cost. At the same time, we are looking at airports where charges are low. When a passenger flies overseas, the common model of a full service airline includes food, beverage and Wi-Fi. Can we unbundle that and ask a passenger to pay for the services? I feel people will want to see it unbundled, like in domestic routes. You decide what you want to buy and pay for that. So, a long-haul model was on your mind when you finalised the aircraft order. Which model will you be looking at? Yes. We have an option of converting 50 aircraft of the order into wide body. We have wide flexibility in selecting the model. At present, either the 787 or 777 Boeing are feasible. We will take a call depending on unit economics. Our narrow body order (737 Max) also has a larger range than our existing aircraft. That will get us to some destinations where we do not fly currently. Which ones? We will look at a lot of eastern European destinations. On the eastern side, we will look at Far East Asia, Malaysia, Singapore and Vietnam. We always explore new markets. With smaller planes, we had gone to destinations where there used to be no flight. Internationally, we will look at places not explored much by other players. Have you decided whether it should be Max 8, 9 or 10? It will be a mix of both 8 and 9. Max 8 and 9 have a larger range whereas Max 10 has a lower range. Then, there is an option of a 50 wide body aircraft. That means a mixed fleet that can increase your cost. Max 8 and 9 are similar aircraft. The difference is the number of seats. A wide body will be different but you have to think out of the box. Previously, the notion was one-model fleet is ideal. Why have a different model for regional? We showed this could be profitable and others are also going for that. I think an aircraft model should be decided case-by-case, based on merits. Not get stuck to one theoretical model. Will joining global alliances be an option? First, travellers need to fly directly to the Western destinations. After starting operations, if we find there is a demand for destinations beyond our range, we will certainly look at alliances. Let us first start.

After three days together at a pair of meetings in Europe, the Canadian prime minister spent a press conference bobbing, weaving and ducking questions from reporters about his U.S. counterpart. The barrage of media queries came as the 43rd Group of Seven summit in Sicily ended with the U.S. president as an outlier. The final meeting communique had all leaders except Trump back the Paris climate accord and added new caveats aimed at appeasing the U.S. -- thanks in part to diplomacy and deft editing by Canada. But while Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron showed signs of frustration with Trump -- the German chancellor said Sunday that Europe can no longer fully rely on the U.S. -- Trudeau put on a happy face. He’s intent on playing peacemaker while confronting a growing list of disputes with his top trade partner in areas such as lumber, dairy and aerospace. And, given the dependence that Canada has on its southern neighbor, he has a lot to lose. “I’m not going to lecture another country on what they should do, nor will I have my position determined by anyone outside of Canada,” Trudeau said when asked about Trump at a press conference Saturday in the seaside town of Taormina, Italy. “We share a very similar approach on a broad range of issues.” Trump officially set the table for new talks on the North American Free Trade Agreement when he notified Congress on May 18 that he intends to start renegotiating the 23-year-old deal binding the U.S., Canada and Mexico in 90 days. Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland joined Trudeau at the G-7 and said Canada would be focused on finding “common ground” with the U.S. on trade. Lumber Dispute In a 30-minute bilateral meeting on Saturday, Trump and Trudeau discussed trade but not Nafta specifically, said a Canadian government official speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss private deliberations. The Congressional notice period prevents Trump from discussing Nafta with Canadian and Mexico officials. Instead, the pair talked about softwood lumber, steel, aluminum and aerospace. In the latter case, Trudeau’s government is threatening to back out of a planned purchase of Boeing Co. fighter jets because of a trade case pending against Canada’s Bombardier Inc. Trump said in a Twitter post on Saturday, not long after meeting with Trudeau, that he’d “take major action if necessary” as his Commerce Department reviews whether steel and aluminum imports threaten national security. Through it all, Trudeau espoused a positive view of Trump. “We know that creating growth through trade in ways that benefits all our citizens is a priority we share,” Trudeau told reporters. “The approach that we need to strike fair, free, open, balanced trade is something we all share around the table.” It was a decidedly rosier conclusion than others. Merkel, conversely, left the G-7 to declare that “the last few days” left her reassessing the reliability of the transatlantic relationship. “We Europeans must really take our destiny into our own hands,” she said. Macron, the newly elected French president, later described his knuckle-crushing handshake with Trump as a “moment of truth” designed to show he’s no pushover. ‘Fight Protectionism’ While the summit face-time yielded little on Nafta, it underscored Trump’s position -- and hinted at a change. The U.S. initially bristled at the inclusion of a pledge to oppose protectionism in the G-7’s joint release.

PUBLISHED : Monday, 29 May, 2017, 2:58pm UPDATED : Monday, 29 May, 2017, 5:20pm Comments:   May Chan Rhodes Share PrintEmail Related topics PolyU – THE Innovation & Impact Summit [Sponsored article] With a decades-long track record of working closely with the government and fostering professional skills in the private sector, technology know-how and scientific research, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) has always been at the heart of the economic development in Hong Kong, as its alumni assume global leadership positions in various industries. “PolyU have trained over 400,000 graduates over the course of 80 years,” says Professor Philip Chan, deputy president and provost of the university. Its close partnership with the industry and the government goes back to 1937, when it started out as a government-funded vocational school. “Professional training, scientific research with an emphasis on application, and partnership with the public and business sectors have always been the cornerstones for PolyU,” says Chan. “We have been providing much-needed talents to various industries, including manufacturing, construction and engineering, transport and aviation, and more. We are better positioned than any other local university to understand what it takes to take Hong Kong’s economy to the next level.” In celebration of its 80th anniversary, PolyU is co-hosting the “Times Higher Education Innovation & Impact Summit” with the leading education publication. PolyU was ranked 17th in the latest Times Higher Education’s Asia University Rankings. The three-day summit, starting from the end of May, will feature global movers and shakers from higher-education, government, and business sectors, who will brainstorm ways to empower universities’ economic and social impact through innovative research and teaching. World-renowned leaders who will share insights include Charles Chen Yidan, founder of Yidan Prize and core founder of Tencent Holdings Limited; Hermann Hauser, co-founder of Amadeus Capital Partners; Candace Johnson, Founder/Co-Founder SES, Loral-Teleport Europe, Europe Online, VATM, GTWN, OWNSAT, Success Europe; and Greg Simon, Former executive director, White House Cancer Moonshot Task Force. The Showcase in the summit will focus on four areas: space, aviation and railway, sustainable urban development, human-centred innovation, and hospitality. Aviation is one of the strategic highlights for PolyU in terms of research and innovation. Utilising its extensive network with world-class aircraft maintenance companies and factories, as well as its profound knowledge of the industry’s regional development thanks to its close links with the government and industry representatives, PolyU is playing a key role in elevating Hong Kong’s status as a regional aviation hub, particularly in terms of the Maintenance, Repair, and Overhaul (MRO) of aircrafts. The school has also partnered with Boeing to setup an Aviation Services Research Centre (ASRC) to develop new or improved aviation service technologies and processes applicable to the industry. The ASRC business scope covers aviation service research, manpower development, and business information exchange. This is one of the best examples of how PolyU is pushing forward the transformation of Hong Kong into a knowledge-based economy. By working with world-class industry leaders in researching and developing new technology, industry standards and skills, Hong Kong is able to position itself as a global leader in the MRO industry. Apart from aviation, Chan says PolyU is also dedicating its inter-disciplinary effort in addressing social issues such as ageing population, and sustainable urbanisation. For example, combining the efforts and expertise of engineering, information technology, life sciences, medicine, and social science, the university is conducting new research in order to bring about a new era of “healthy, active ageing” where the elderly will receive sufficient and suitable support for their physical, mental and social well-being. The university is also contributing to the Hong Kong’s transformation into a smart city. For example, thanks to expertise in information technology, geo-informatics, construction and land surveying, PolyU staff and alumni have been heavily involved in the development of East Kowloon, looking into how to incorporate technology into facilities management and eco-friendly features. Such an interdisciplinary approach is reflective of the global trend in the higher education scene. “It’s clear that in the future, the creation of new knowledge will be cross-disciplinary in nature,” says Chan. “The traditional academic disciplines have already got decades, if not hundreds of years of history, where knowledge has been accumulated to a very deep level. It makes sense to look into how to make use of different schools of knowledge to create something new, instead of just digging deeper and deeper into a well-explored subject.” Another global trend in higher education is the increasingly close partnership between universities and start-ups. In a globally competitive economy, mega enterprises grow not only in scale, but also in the need for innovation. As a result, they look to universities as breeding grounds for new ideas. “University is a place where bright, eager young minds can innovate without the constraints and repercussion of the real world,” says Chan. “They can afford to do what mega enterprises cannot, try new ideas and fail. That is why they are interested in supporting start-up businesses on a university level, and are eager to look for potential partnerships or acquisitions of these businesses.” “We have already nurtured over 200 start-ups in the last few years, and 70 per cent are still sustainable,” he continues. “PolyU has been promoting start-ups by granting seed-funds to winning business proposals from alumni and undergraduates, and matching them with industry figures and private investors. It is a very concrete way of making an impact.

Thao said she will meet exchange officials in New York later this week. Vietjet founder Nguyen Thi Phuong Thao discusses a possible overseas listing and plans to develop long haul flights. Source: Bloomberg The plan for the 41 trillion-dong ($1.8 billion) low-cost carrier comes amid the government’s easing of rules to allow more foreign investment in one of the fastest-growing aviation markets. Hanoi-based VietJet, known for a marketing stunt featuring bikini-clad service crew, received shareholder approval in April to boost its foreign ownership limit to 49 percent from 30 percent. “Listing overseas on big markets will help increase our access to more fund sources, boost the trading of our stock and expand the list of our investors,” said Thao, a self-made billionaire. “We don’t want to hide our hope to become the first Vietnamese company to list shares overseas.” The most important market news of the day. Get our markets daily newsletter. Sign Up Shares of VietJet rose 0.8 percent to 127,800 dong at the close in Ho Chi Minh City, the biggest gain in more than two weeks. The stock has surged about 51 percent since it started trading three months ago, compared with a 6.4 percent increase in the Bloomberg Asia Pacific Airlines Index. The overseas listing plan would make VietJet the first Vietnamese company to officially trade overseas, according to Tran Anh Dao, deputy chief executive of the Ho Chi Minh City Stock Exchange. While VietJet has done well in Vietnam, it faces tougher competition against entrenched players such as low-cost carrier AirAsia Bhd., as well as Cathay Pacific’s regional unit, Cathay Dragon, as it expands in Asia, said Tyler Cheung, director of institutional clients at ACB Securities Co. in Ho Chi Minh City. “They have been able to accomplish something impressive in a relatively small period of time,” Cheung said. “The question is whether their business model and corporate strategy can transfer to a regional play.” Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Ltd. doesn’t comment on individual companies, a spokeswoman said in an email. Singapore Exchange Ltd. declined in an email to comment. VietJet, which began operating six years ago, has 136 foreign investors who own 26 percent of the company, Thao, 46, said in April. She owns more than 60 percent of the airline directly and through holding companies and other entities, according to filings. The increase in foreign ownership will need to be approved by Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc because aviation is considered a restricted industry, with the limit currently capped at 30 percent. The airline has filed paperwork requesting the increase, Thao said. Raising the limit isn’t aimed at attracting a strategic investor, although the company is open to one, she said. “We always wanted to be the pioneer,” Thao said. “We want to increase our stock value and to boost the ability to mobilize capital with more participation of investors.” Thao made her first million dollars at age 21 selling fax machines and latex rubber. Almost a quarter of a century later, the executive became Southeast Asia’s first self-made woman billionaire with the listing of VietJet. Purchase Negotiations Thao engages in round-the-clock negotiations with plane and engine makers by herself, surviving on as little as three hours of sleep a night, said VietJet Managing Director Luu Duc Khanh. In May last year, she sealed an $11.3 billion deal with Boeing Co. to buy 100 737 Max 200 aircraft just in time to have it announced during then-President Barack Obama’s visit to Vietnam. The carrier agreed to buy 30 A320neos valued at $3.6 billion at list price in 2015, adding to an order for as many as 100 Airbus planes a year earlier. The budget airline forecasts profit will rise 36 percent this year from 2.5 trillion dong in 2016. VietJet expects to serve 17 million passengers this year, after carrying about 15 million travelers in 2016. Its biggest competitor is Vietnam Airlines. The national carrier owns 70 percent of low-cost operator Jetstar Pacific Airlines Aviation JSC, with Qantas Airways Ltd. holding the remaining 30 percent. Vietnam Airlines also owns Vietnam Air Services Co., known as Vasco. VietJet and Vietnam Airlines each have a 42 percent share of the domestic aviation, said Brendan Sobie, a Singapore-based analyst at CAPA Centre for Aviation. VietJet’s share could rise to 50 percent within three years, he said in April. “Vietnamese aviation is growing at a high rate,” Thao said. “When we open the door wider for foreign investors and create more opportunities for them, it also means we increase the chance for the local aviation industry and domestic stock market to expand and integrate faster into international aviation markets.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

As per International Air Transport Association, in 2015, globally, over 3.5 Billion people had safely commuted. With air transport being cost effective day-by-day, the number of travellers is expected to increase significantly. Thriving number of aircraft passengers has created a strong demand for efficient oxygen systems. With increasing altitude, partial pressure of oxygen decreases which makes it progressively more difficult to inhale or intake oxygen.

In a surprise statement, manufacturer Irkut Corporation and its state-controlled parent company United Aircraft Corporation (UAC) said an MS-21-300 model had successfully completed a 30-minute flight at a height of 1,000 metres and travelling at 300 km an hour. Squeezed by Western sanctions over its role in the Ukraine crisis, Russia is trying to rejuvenate domestic industrial production to make the country less dependant on foreign firms. The test flight, which was not announced to media beforehand, comes just three weeks after China staged the maiden flight of its new C919 passenger jet, highlighting the growing competition to industry heavyweights Boeing and Airbus. Russian officials have said the MS-21 is superior to its Western-made counterparts in many respects and will be snapped up by both Russian and foreign carriers, but Western analysts says both Russia and China face a huge challenge to shatter the transatlantic airplane duopoly. “The flight mission has been completed. The flight was fine, there were no observations which will prevent further testing,” test pilot Oleg Kononenko was quoted as saying. Russia has fought hard to shake its Soviet reputation for old and creaking aircraft flown by inexperienced crews. — Reuters ← Previous Why nuclear plants could become the next ‘fossil’ fuel UK defence minister denies report of divisions Next → You May Also Like European court upholds ban on headscarves 14/03/2017 Oman Observer Comments Off on European court upholds ban on headscarves China military apologises for photoshopped navy picture 27/04/2017 Oman Observer Comments Off on China military apologises for photoshopped navy picture ‘World has just months to stop starvation in Yemen, Somalia’ 22/03/2017 Oman Observer Comments Off on ‘World has just months to stop starvation in Yemen, Somalia’ Latest News Oman, Yemen review good relations 29/05/2017 Oman Observer Comments Off on Oman, Yemen review good relations A breather as Mawaleh gets imported veggies 29/05/2017 Kabeer Yousuf Comments Off on A breather as Mawaleh gets imported veggies No respite from heat until Thursday 29/05/2017 Vinod Nair Comments Off on No respite from heat until Thursday It’s illegal to hire runaway maids during Ramadhan 29/05/2017 Fahad Al Ghadani Comments Off on It’s illegal to hire runaway maids during Ramadhan Facebook Instagram Load More...

MUKILTEO — Kevin Beavers remains in the pole position to win his third straight Snohomish County Amateur golf tournament. However, Ethan Casto is making sure Beavers has to earn it. Beavers, the two-time defending champion, shot a 3-under-par 69 Sunday at Harbour Pointe Golf Club to remain in the lead after two rounds of the Snohomish County Amateur at 5-under. But Casto had the low score of the day, shooting a blistering 4-under-par 68, and trails Beavers by a single stroke going into Monday’s final round. “I played pretty well,” Casto, a Snohomish native who turned 20 Saturday, said. “I kept it in play all day, which was good, and then just made a couple putts.” Casto, a freshman at Western Washington University, was one of three members of the Vikings team to sign up for the tournament at the last minute. Western played at the NCAA Division II men’s golf championships earlier this week, and had things gone to plan, Casto wouldn’t have entered the County Am as the Vikings would have been competing for a national title Friday in Kissimmee, Florida. But Western didn’t make the final eight, meaning Casto was able to make it back in time for Saturday’s opening round at Legion Memorial Golf Course, where he shot an even-par 72. Casto, who’s playing in his first County Am, followed that up Sunday by setting a pace at Harbour Pointe no one else was able to match. Playing in the day’s first group, Casto registered five birdies and just a single bogey in what he described as a consistent performance. His birdie at the 513-yard, par-5 18th hole — where he just missed the green in two — was what gave him the day’s low round. “Yesterday I felt like I played terrible,” Casto said. “Today I felt like I played really well. I think this golf course is harder than Legion, so the score is a lot better.” Casto could have an insider’s advantage Monday. Snohomish Golf Course, the site of the final round, is his home course. But Casto may need all the home-course advantage he can muster to overcome Beavers, who’s taken quite a liking to the County Am. Beavers, a 33-year-old Boeing engineer from Seattle, won the tournament the only two previous times he entered, and he has a chance to become just the second player ever to win three straight County Ams, joining Bob Burton from 1973-75. Sunday was just another good day at the office for Beavers. Beavers, who came into the day with a two-stroke lead after shooting a 2-under 70 at Legion Memorial, made six birdies en route to his 69. It was a birdie at 18 that gave Beavers the lead heading into the final round. “Today I was conservative the majority of the day, but I felt like my course management was exceptional today,” Beavers said. “Yesterday it was more like you can hit it and find it and hit it again. This golf course won’t let you do that so much, you’ve got to hit the fairways. Even if you have a 7-iron into the green, it’s better doing that from the fairway than taking your chances with the driver. So I think I played well today, I really did.” For the second straight day Beavers had to overcome some early adversity. He double-bogeyed the fifth hole and bogeyed the sixth. But he bounced back with a birdie on seven to get his round back on course. He was 4-under over his final 12 holes. “It kind of got me back into things,” Beavers said of the seventh hole. “I actually made a long putt there, about 30 feet. It was just like, ‘Phew, all right, let’s keep going.’” Alvin Kwak shot a 2-under 70, putting him at 2-under for the tournament and alone in third place. The 16-year-old Mukilteo resident and sophomore at Kamiak High School will round out Monday’s final threesome, which is scheduled to tee off at 10:54 a.m. “I played really well,” said Kwak, who finished with six birdies and four bogeys. “I wasn’t putting as well as yesterday, so I could have gone a lot lower. But still I can’t complain about 70.” Chris Hatch of Mukilteo, Casto’s Western teammate, and Jacob Rohde of Everett were the only other players under par for the tournament. Both shot 71s Sunday and are tied for fourth at 1-under.   The first grouping of the day putt Sunday morning during the second round of the Snohomish County Amateur Golf Tournament on May 28, 2017.

Share Tweet Share Email Comments Print Ford Motor Co. President and CEO Mark Fields speaks during a media preview of the 2018 Lincoln Navigator at the New York International Auto Show in New York on April 12. ASSOCIATED PRESS Enlarge DETROIT — Ford is replacing CEO Mark Fields as it struggles to keep its traditional auto-manufacturing business running smoothly while remaking itself as a nimble, high-tech provider of new mobility services. The 114-year-old automaker said Fields is retiring at age 56 after 28 years at the company. Fields will be replaced by Jim Hackett, a former CEO of office furniture company Steelcase Inc. who joined Ford’s board in 2013. Hackett has led Ford’s mobility unit since March of last year. In a press conference Monday at Ford’s Dearborn headquarters, Hackett said Ford does a lot of things well, but is not as good at handling complex strategy questions. Hackett plans to have a small executive team that can set the company’s plans, communicate them clearly and make decisions quickly. That’s a contrast to Fields, who had 20 direct reports and was a product of Ford’s bureaucratic culture. “The biggest challenge I had (at Steelcase), and I will have here, is to have everybody see the future. They can see their opportunity in that. And secondly, that it’s our right to win and we don’t have to cede that to anybody, Tesla or any of them,” Hackett said. “I love that challenge because I know how to do that.” In three years as CEO, Fields began Ford’s transition from a traditional automaker into a “mobility” company, laying out plans to build autonomous vehicles and explore new services such as ride-hailing and car-sharing. Silicon Valley companies such as Google were pushing into the car business, while Uber and Lyft threatened to change people’s attitudes toward car ownership. In fact, it was Fields who put Hackett in charge of those projects as head of mobility. Under Fields, Ford achieved a record pretax profit of $10.8 billion in 2015 as SUV and truck sales soared in the U.S. But there were rumblings that Fields wasn’t focused enough on Ford’s core business. Popular products like the Fusion sedan and Escape SUV grew dated. Ford lagged behind rivals in bringing long-range electric cars to the market. Ford couldn’t pivot quickly; when subcompact SUV sales boomed in the U.S., for example, it didn’t bring over a small SUV being sold in other regions. The stock price sagged — electric car maker Tesla Inc. even passed Ford in market value earlier this year. Ford’s shares jumped nearly 2 percent to $11.06 in morning trading. The company’s stock price has fallen almost 40 percent since Fields became CEO in July 2014. Hackett was the CEO of Steelcase for 20 years. He is credited with transforming that company, in part by predicting the shift away from cubicles and into open office plans. He cut thousands of jobs and moved furniture production from the U.S. to Mexico to stem massive losses at the company. In an interview, Ford Motor Co. Executive Chairman Bill Ford called Hackett a “visionary” who knows how to remake a business. “These are really unparalleled times, and it really requires transformational leadership during these times,” Bill Ford said. Hackett also served as the interim athletic director at the University of Michigan from 2014 to 2016. In that role, he lured star football coach Jim Harbaugh. Bill Ford insisted that Fields wasn’t fired. He called Fields “an outstanding leader” who orchestrated the company’s turnaround a decade ago when he was head of Ford’s Americas division. “He and I sat down Friday and really decided this was the right time for him to go and for us to have new leadership,” Bill Ford said. Fields resurrected Ford’s luxury Lincoln brand and grew sales in China. His bet on using aluminum for Ford’s trucks paid off in terms of better fuel economy and strong sales. Fields opened an office in Silicon Valley to hire talented young researchers and scout out promising startups. But investors worried about Ford’s sliding U.S. market share and product decisions. U.S. sales are plateauing after years of growth, and Ford has been losing share in that all-important market. Unprofitable small cars have chipped away at some of the profit from SUVs. And in the electric car market, General Motors put the Chevrolet Bolt, with 238 miles of range, on sale last year; Ford is working on an electric SUV with 300 miles of range, but it’s not due out until 2020. Meanwhile, Mary Barra — who became GM’s CEO about six months before Fields became Ford’s — has made a series of headline-grabbing moves, such as forming a partnership with the ride-hailing company Lyft and pulling GM out of unprofitable markets, including Europe, India and South Africa. Even though GM shares are trading a few cents below the $33 initial public offering price from November 2010, the board appears satisfied with Barra’s performance. Hackett is confident he can placate and discontent on Wall Street. “The way that that gets fixed is the nature of the innovation and the ideas making their way into the market,” Hackett said. “It even sounds a little corny but the stock price is a consequence of the actions we’re going to take to make the company more fit, more profitable and a more fun place to work.” Barclay’s analyst Brian Johnson predicts more emphasis on cost-cutting under Hackett. GM has exceeded Wall Street’s profit expectations, while Ford’s results have been softer. Ford needs to turn that around for the share price to grow, Johnson said. Fields also had the tough job of following CEO Alan Mulally, another auto industry outsider who was hired away from Boeing to lead Ford. Mulally, who joined Ford in 2006 when it was near bankruptcy, was widely credited with ending internal bickering at Ford and streamlining manufacturing. As part of the shake-up, several Ford executives are taking on new roles as of June 1. Jim Farley, who led the company’s European division back to profitability, will become vice president of global markets and will oversee Lincoln, sales and marketing. Joe Hinrichs, president of Ford’s Americas division, will oversee global product development, manufacturing and quality. Marcy Klevorn, Ford’s chief technical officer, will oversee a new mobility division.

DoD photo Posted By: Richard Sisk May 29, 2017 Defense Secretary Jim Mattis finally has a financial officer to fill the comptroller’s spot at the Pentagon, but dozens of political appointee slots remain vacant four months into the administration of President Donald Trump. The Senate on Thursday confirmed David Norquist, the former chief financial officer for the Department of Homeland Security and the brother of anti-tax crusader Grover Norquist, as comptroller. In his confirmation hearings, Norquist, a former partner at financial services contractor Kearney & Co. in Virginia, pledged to finally get an audit going at the Defense Department, which has never had one. “Everything you have heard about the size and complexity of the department is true,” Norquist said, “but that is not a reason to delay the audit. That is a reason to begin.” By unanimous consent, the Senate also confirmed Robert Story Karem as assistant secretary of defense for international security affairs and Kari Bingen as principal deputy under secretary of defense for intelligence. Bingen has served in several congressional staff positions, and most recently was policy director for the House Armed Services Committee. Karem has worked as a Middle East adviser to former Vice President Dick Cheney and a legislative aide to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Kentucky). Three more nominees — Elaine McCusker to be deputy comptroller; Robert Daigle to be director of the Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation office; and Kenneth Rapuano for assistant secretary of defense for homeland and global security — have been approved by the Senate Armed Services Committee but still await a vote by the full Senate. The Pentagon has more than 50 slots for political nominations by Trump requiring Senate confirmation. The confirmations of Norquist, Karem and Bingen appears to bring the total number of political appointments at DoD thus far to five, counting Mattis and new Air Force Secretary Heather Wilson. The posts of Army secretary and Navy secretary remain open, and the No. 2 position at the Pentagon is still held by Deputy Secretary Bob Work, an Obama administration holdover. Boeing executive Patrick Shanahan has been named by Mattis to replace Work, but he has yet to be formally nominated by the White House more than two months after his name was announced. Work had expected to leave the post this month. Previous post About the Author Richard Sisk Richard Sisk is a reporter for Military.com. He can be reached at richard.sisk@military.com.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 29 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Global Aircraft Tire Market 2017-2021 with Bridgestone, Dunlop Aircraft Tyres, Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company & Michelin Aircraft Tyre Dominating – Research and Markets DUBLIN, May 29, 2017 /PRNewswire/ — Research and Markets has announced the addition of the „Global Aircraft Tire Market 2017-2021” report to their offering. The global aircraft tire market to grow at a CAGR of 4.75% during the period 2017-2021. The report covers the present scenario and the growth prospects of the global aircraft tire market for 2017-2021. To calculate the market size, the report considers the revenue generated in the overall market from the procurement of new tires (for new aircraft) as well as the retreading or replacement of existing tires. The report also includes a discussion of the key vendors operating in this market. One trend in market is emergence of green aircraft taxiing systems. Aircraft taxiing involves the movement of aircraft on the ground under its own engine power, which burns a significant amount of fuel. An Airbus A320 aircraft uses approximately 600 liters of fuel while taxiing for an average of 3.5 hours a day. This has necessitated the adoption of alternative approaches for taxiing an aircraft. A number of stakeholders have directed their efforts in developing alternative hybrid or electrically driven approaches to mitigate the excessive fuel consumption and emission impact during taxiing aircraft. According to the report, one driver in market is rise in aircraft retrofitting. There are many aircraft that have been in service for a long time across the globe. These aircraft require periodic component retrofitting for optimal functioning. Landing gear components, including tires and braking systems, need periodical replacements to keep an aircraft in optimum working condition, as well as to enhance the operational efficiency of aircraft landing gear systems. Retrofitting of landing gears would play greater importance in the growth of the global aircraft tire market, especially for the radial tires segment. Further, the report states that one challenge in market is dominance of OEMs and landing gear suppliers in dictating contract conditions. The high bargaining power of any single stakeholder is not a positive sign for any industry. Boeing and Airbus being the two major streamlined aircraft OEMs retain supremacy on finalizing the prices of aircraft tires for their respective aircraft. Also, major landing gear suppliers, such as General Electric (GE) and United Technologies Corporation (UTC), exercise control over structuring the overall features and prices of landing gear systems, which include tires along with other components.  Key vendors Key Topics Covered: Media Contact: Research and Markets Laura Wood, Senior Manager press@researchandmarkets.com   SOURCE Research and Markets CategoriesUncategorized TagsSurveys, Polls and Research Post navigation Previous PostPrevious Infrared Search & Track (IRST) System Market Worth 5.95 Billion USD by 2022 Next PostNext Refrigerant Compressors Market will grow at a CAGR of 4.92% till 2021: Radiant Insights Search Recent Posts EnXray Hires Commercial Director Polyetherimide(PEI) Market Segmentation, Manufacturing Cost Analysis Including Key Raw Materials, Price Trend, Key Suppliers and Forecast 2022 Plastic Optical Fiber(POF) Market Competitive Landscape, Trends, Market Concentration Rate, Business Strategies 2022 New Report of High Purity Magnesium Chloride Market Share, Growth by Top Company, Region, Application, Driver, Trends & Forecasts by 2022 Fused Silica Market with Focus on Emerging Technologies, Regional Trends, Competitive Landscape, Regional Analysis & Forecasts to 2022 Business Directory Business Contacts Meta Log in Entries RSS Comments RSS WordPress.org Proudly powered by WordPress

It Took Two Days for Mainstream Media to Post Big Stories About Portland Attack and the Suspect, Who Is a Known White Supremacist: The incident happened on Friday afternoon—two men were killed by a man who was yelling racist slurs at two teenage girls, one of whom wore a hajib, on a Portland MAX train. The man charged with the murders, Jeremy Christian, is a known white supremacist. But mainstream news said very little about the incident on Friday, buried the story at the bottom of their pages on Saturday and much of Sunday. Only on Sunday night, did the incident (which has the appearance of white supremacist terrorism) rise to the top of their pages. And one suspects that a much-retweeted tweet by Dan Rather, the former news anchor for the CBS Evening News, had something to do with this increased coverage and a response from the White House, which was tweeted this morning. Dan Rather to Trump: Say their names. Taliesin Myrddin Namkai-Meche and Ricky John Best were stabbed death not by a Muslim but a man yelling at a Muslim teenager and her black American friend. The third person stabbed by the terrorist, Micah Fletcher, is a poet who won in 2013 a poetry competition with a "poem condemning Islamophobia."

He had no idea what hit him. It was a speeding pickup truck. It struck him with all its force, destroyed his body, and did not stop. The young man died on the spot. Witnesses believe the driver attended the party and deliberately killed their friend. KOMO reports that the mother of the dead man wants justice. Bullets Fly In Pioneer Square: The incident happened near the entry of the Pioneer Square Station at around 11 p.m.. A fight broke out. A car sped away. But the car returned a moment later, and two people on the sidewalk fired at it. The police arrived and found 24 bullet casings on the street and sidewalk. 24! They also found a person bleeding to death in a car. This person was taken to Harborview Medical Center, where another person suffering from bullet wounds appeared and received treatment. Both are expected to survive. KOMO reports that one suspect is in custody and two are "on the loose." Tourists Say Seattle Is Too Expensive: My Northwest reports that a travelers survey conducted by JD Power found that people visiting Seattle just to see the city, found "lodging, parking, transportation, entertainment, and activities are too expensive." The wonder is someone would visit our city just to see it. There is, too be honest, nothing to really see here. New York City, New Orleans, Los Angeles—these are places to see. Trump Claims in a Tweet That Trumpcare Will Put More Money Into Healthcare: The neo-Keynesian economist and NYT columnist Paul Krugman is under the impression that Trump does not know that Trumpcare will take nearly $1 trillion out of the system. But he does know this. He knows it very well. He is just lying, and nothing more. He has lied before and he will lie again. Saying he is in a muddle only makes matters worse. The US Considering Banning Laptops From All Incoming and Outgoing International Flights: The laptop ban, which is nothing but cruel, is currently imposed on nonstop US-bound flights from airports in 10 Muslim-majority countries. As to why international flights are more vulnerable than domestic ones—this is not explained. Also, the current ban and its possible expansion is not responding to any specific threat but a hunch. Boeing Took $242 million From Poor People in the State of Washington And Gave It to Its Shareholders: That's the right way of looking at it.

"On the MC-21 plane, we proceed from the fact that we will offer a full-cycle contract: from delivery to the utilization of the machine itself. And of course in terms of its performance characteristics, it is now ahead of its competitors, both Boeing and Airbus," Rogozin said adding that the aircraft price will be more competitive than the one for the European or US analogues. According to the deputy prime minister, the flight trials of MC-21 are to be completed in 2018. "We have now moved to the second stage of the flight tests of the PD-14 engine. Since spring 2019, the Russian engine PD-14 will be used in the aircraft," Rogozin announced, adding that the tests of the engine are carried out with the use of Ilyushin Il-76 flying simulator in the town of Zhukovskiy in the Moscow Region. Medvedev, in turn, noted that the new models of airplanes and helicopters should be developed in Russia. Apart from the MC-21 aircraft test, the maiden flight of Ka-62 helicopter was also successful, the prime minister noted. "It is necessary to assess what had happened and work further across the board. Of course, first of all, [the work should be carried out] in the technological direction now. But do not forget the commercial prospects. Because, the more orders we will receive for these new vehicles, the better, of course, for our country," Medvedev stressed. The MC-21 is a twin-engine medium-haul airliner with a capacity of 150-212 passengers. The presentation of the aircraft took place in June 2016 in the Russian city of Irkutsk while the maiden flight was carried out on Sunday. The overall volume of sales the MC-21 passenger plane is expected to amount to 1,000 pieces till 2037, Russian Industry and Trade Minister Denis Manturov said Sunday. The maiden flight of the Ka-62 helicopter was carried out on Thursday.   Never miss a story again — sign up to our Telegram channel and we'll keep you up to speed! ...
