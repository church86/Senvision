This is SpaceX’s entire MO, the whole idea behind their business strategy. CEO Elon Musk has believed for years that by reusing and recycling tech and parts, we can bring the cost of space flight down dramatically. What SpaceX is doing could dramatically improve access to launch equipment, since the company is trying to operate like an airline — charging customers for the service of delivering something to space. Right now, a launch costs about $62 million from the customer. Most of that goes to the actual cost of constructing the 230-foot tall Falcon 9. But, if you can recycle major pieces of the mission, then that’s time and money that can go somewhere else.

The facility is Boeing's only jetliner assembly factory outside of Washington state and, in contrast to the others, is not unionized. Last month, the same plane provided a dramatic backdrop for President Donald Trump's visit to the Boeing factory on Feb 17, where he promised to boost U.S. manufacturing and punish companies for moving jobs overseas. Companies in Japan, China, Italy, Sweden, France and Britain produce many of the 787's major components, such as wings, fuselage sections and the rudder. Airlines can choose engines from General Electric Co of the U.S., or Britain's Rolls-Royce Holdings PLC. The first 787-10 took off from the runway around 9:38 a.m. ET (1338 GMT) on an initial flight expected to last four hours. The 787-10 is the second and final "stretch," or elongation, of the original 787-8, which debuted in 2011. The 787-10 seats 330 passengers in a typical cabin configuration, 40 more than the 787-9 and 88 more than the 787-8. The 787 family has been a top seller, logging about 1,200 firm orders. So far, the 787-10 has booked 149 orders from nine customers, about 12 percent of the total of firm orders. The mid-sized 787-9 has captured just over half the total. After spending 2017 in testing, the 787-10 is expected to enter service with airlines in 2018.  Go to MSN Home Go to MSN Money Join the conversation Report Abuse Report inappropriate content Sorry!

The plane, which sells for US$312.8 million (RM1.38 billion) at list price and rounds out a family of three carbon-fibre composite Dreamliners, flew well, the pilots said. “We had a great flight,” Captain Tim Berg said at a news conference after the flight. The plane “performed exactly like we thought it would.” The flight was one of three initial voyages yesterday, joining the Airbus A319neo jetliner and the Antonov An-132D, a light turboprop military transport developed with Saudi Arabia. Boeing's 787-10 is being built at Boeing's factory in North Charleston, South Carolina, due to its large size. The facility is Boeing's only jetliner assembly factory outside of Washington state and, in contrast to the others, is not unionized. Last month, the new plane provided a dramatic backdrop for President Donald Trump's visit to the Boeing factory, where he promised to boost US manufacturing and punish companies for moving jobs overseas. Companies in Japan, China, Italy, Sweden, France and Britain produce many of the 787's major components, such as wings, fuselage sections and the rudder. Airlines can choose engines from General Electric Co of the United States, or Britain's Rolls-Royce Holdings Plc. The first 787-10 took off at 9.38am EDT (1338 GMT) and landed at 2.35pm EDT. The plane is a second and final "stretch," of the original 787-8, which debuted in 2011. It is 18 feet (5.5 metres) longer than the 787-9 and seats 330 passengers, 40 more than the 787-9 and 88 more than the 787-8. The 787 has been a top seller, with 1,200 firm orders as airlines use it to open new routes between smaller cities that can be profitable with the fuel-efficient 787. Airbus competes against the 787-10 with its A330neo, a remake of its older, aluminum-hulled A330 equipped with fuel-efficient engines. Both jets are optimised for shorter flights compared with other mid-sized, twin-aisle planes. After brisk initial sales, orders for both have slowed, with Airbus selling just over 220 of its A330neo. So far, the 787-10 has booked 149 orders from nine customers, about 12 per cent of the total of firm orders. The mid-sized 787-9 has captured just over half the total. After spending 2017 in testing, the 787-10 is expected to enter service with airlines in 2018. — Reuters                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week British foreign minister to visit Russia to discuss differences Trump to speak at conservative forum, as some question his immigration, trade views Why is Maduro still in power in Venezuela?

ET Share this article NORTH CHARLESTON, S.C., March 31, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- The Boeing (NYSE: BA) 787-10 Dreamliner took to the skies for the first time today at Boeing South Carolina. The airplane, which is the newest and longest model of the 787 family, completed a successful flight totaling four hours and 58 minutes.  "The 787-10's first flight moves us one step closer to giving our customers the most efficient airplane in its class," said Boeing Commercial Airplanes President & CEO Kevin McAllister. "The airplane will give carriers added flexibility in growing their network routes and build on the overwhelming success of the 787 Dreamliner family." The Boeing 787-10 Dreamliner took to the skies for the first time today at Boeing South Carolina. This air-to-air photo shows the airplane during its flight. Piloted by Boeing Test & Evaluation Capts. Tim Berg and Mike Bryan, the airplane performed tests on flight controls, systems and handling qualities. The 787-10 will now undergo comprehensive flight testing before customer deliveries begin in the first half of 2018. "From takeoff to landing, the airplane handled beautifully and just as expected," said Berg, chief 787 pilot. "The 787-10 is a fantastic machine that I know our customers and their passengers will love." The 787-10 has won 149 orders from nine customers across the globe including launch customer Singapore Airlines, Air Lease Corporation (ALC), All Nippon Airways (ANA), British Airways, Etihad Airways, EVA Air, GE Capital Aviation Services (GECAS), KLM Royal Dutch Airlines and United Airlines. As an 18-foot (5.5-m) stretch of the 787-9, the 787-10 will deliver the 787 family's preferred passenger experience and long range with 25 percent better fuel per seat and emissions than the airplanes it will replace and 10 percent better than today's competition. The 787 Dreamliner family is a key part of Boeing's twin-aisle airplane strategy, which offers a modern, optimized and efficient airplane family in every market segment. Since entering service in 2011, the 787 family has flown more than 152 million people on over 560 unique routes around the world, saving an estimated 14 billion pounds of fuel.

"Short delays" are affecting two 777-300ER aircraft with United's Polaris luxury interiors, said Megan McCarthy, a spokeswoman for the airline. United and the planemaker are working with French seatmaker Zodiac Aerospace to expedite shipments, said McCarthy and Doug Alder, a spokesman for Boeing. The stumbles will slow United's efforts to woo international travelers with a rebranding campaign centered on the Polaris cabins, which offer pod-style suites with Zodiac's lie-flat berths. Zodiac, which agreed to be acquired by Safran, has also held back production of Airbus Group's marquee A350 with delays of seats and lavatories. VIDEOS TOP JOBS "It's not just seatless in Seattle, it's seatless in Toulouse," said aviation consultant Robert Mann, referring to the planemakers' manufacturing hubs and a Tom Hanks movie. "It's a serious problem and it's been building." Even delays of a month or two could hurt Chicago-based United if, after a year of marketing build-up, the airline misses a chance to deploy the brand-new 777s on high-profile routes to Asia during the peak summer travel season, Mann said. "You can only make the most money when you have a product in the market at the right time," Mann said. "You are talking consequential damages." Boeing may have to park additional United planes if Zodiac can't provide the complex seats on schedule. For the Chicago-based manufacturer and Airbus, receiving lie-flat seats at the right time is crucial because the products can require extensive rewiring, ductwork changes and reinforced cabin floors. When deliveries run late, planemakers may be forced to remove fittings such as galleys and lavatories so the berths can be installed. It's the latest in a series of production stumbles for Plaisir, France-based Zodiac, which warned this month that fiscal 2017 operating profit would plunge 10 percent. Delays also slowed deliveries of Boeing 787 Dreamliners to customers such as American Airlines Group Inc. over the past two years. At United, Zodiac seats are being installed first on the 777-300ER fleet, then on the carrier's 787-10 and Airbus A350-1000 jets. Existing 767-300 and 777-200 aircraft also will be retrofitted with the cabins. "We're not happy, period," United Chief Executive Oscar Munoz told investors at a JPMorgan Chase event this month. "But rather than just be unhappy, we've got people on site with the folks there to make sure that we can expedite and accelerate as much as we can." Zodiac on March 14 revealed bottlenecks at the Cwmbran, Wales, plant where the Polaris seats are manufactured, as well as problems at U.S. factories that make lavatories for Airbus. The latest production meltdown prompted TCI Fund Management to urge Paris-based Safran to abandon its acquisition of the seatmaker. Zodiac declined to comment on United, a spokeswoman said Thursday. The company said in the March 14 statement that the snags in Wales were "generating significant disruptions and delays that are currently being addressed." The production issues plaguing Zodiac are "probably the worst that the seat-supplier sector has seen in a decade," said Gary Weissel, managing officer with Tronos Aviation Consulting Inc. » Next page...

(REUTERS/Randall Hill) NORTH CHARLESTON, S.C.—Boeing Co.’s newest and largest Dreamliner model, the 787-10, successfully made its first flight on Friday, kicking off a test program for the high-tech jet. The plane, which sells for $312.8 million at list price and rounds out a family of three carbon-fiber composite Dreamliners, flew well, the pilots said. “We had a great flight,” Captain Tim Berg said at a news conference after the flight. The plane “performed exactly like we thought it would.” The flight was one of three initial voyages on Friday, joining the Airbus A319neo jetliner and the Antonov An-132D, a light turboprop military transport developed with Saudi Arabia. Boeing’s 787-10 is being built at Boeing’s factory in North Charleston, South Carolina, due to its large size. The facility is Boeing’s only jetliner assembly factory outside of Washington state and, in contrast to the others, is not unionized. The new Boeing 787-10 Dreamliner takes off during a first flight ceremony at the Charleston International Airport in North Charleston, South Carolina, United States March 31, 2017. (REUTERS/Randall Hill) Last month, the new plane provided a dramatic backdrop for President Donald Trump’s visit to the Boeing factory, where he promised to boost U.S. manufacturing and punish companies for moving jobs overseas. Companies in Japan, China, Italy, Sweden, France, and Britain produce many of the 787’s major components, such as wings, fuselage sections and the rudder. Airlines can choose engines from General Electric Co. of the United States, or Britain’s Rolls-Royce Holdings Plc. The first 787-10 took off at 9:38 a.m. EDT (1338 GMT) and landed at 2:35 pm EDT. The plane is a second and final “stretch,” of the original 787-8, which debuted in 2011. It is 18 feet (5.5 meters) longer than the 787-9 and seats 330 passengers, 40 more than the 787-9 and 88 more than the 787-8. Related Coverage Trump Picks Boeing Executive Shanahan to Become Pentagon’s No.2 Trump Talks Jobs and Jets in Speech at Boeing Factory The 787 has been a top seller, with 1,200 firm orders as airlines use it to open new routes between smaller cities that can be profitable with the fuel-efficient 787. Airbus competes against the 787-10 with its A330neo, a remake of its older, aluminum-hulled A330 equipped with fuel-efficient engines. Both jets are optimized for shorter flights compared with other mid-sized, twin-aisle planes. After brisk initial sales, orders for both have slowed, with Airbus selling just over 220 of its A330neo. So far, the 787-10 has booked 149 orders from nine customers, about 12 percent of the total of firm orders. The mid-sized 787-9 has captured just over half the total. After spending 2017 in testing, the 787-10 is expected to enter service with airlines in 2018.

The F/A-18 Super Hornet, the document says, provides better capabilities while slashing costs by $30 billion. The US Navy is currently slated to alter the composition of carrier wing groups by 2033. Specifically, the groups will maintain two Super Hornet squadrons and two Joint Strike Fighter squadrons, according to a copy of the white paper obtained by Defense One. The shift leaves "significant capability gaps," according to Boeing’s lobbyists. "Additional F-35Cs will not solve this capability gap and will be prohibitively expensive" while the Super Hornets offer “an affordable solution to the inventory challenge.” Over two decades’ time, the Pentagon would save "about $30 billion." To add intrigue to the drama, Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg sat in Trump Tower with then President-elect Donald Trump as he took a call with Lockheed Martin CEO Marillyn Hewson on January 17. While appearing off-guard, Muilenburg could listen to the negotiations about Lockheed’s F-35 Joint Strike Fighter during his visit. The Pentagon’s original bid sent out to defense contractors for the multi-role joint strike fighter was a winner-take-all contract.  Prior to Trump’s comments that the program cost of the F-35 mandated that Boeing "price out" a "comparable” F/A-18 Super Hornet, some feared the Boeing jet might die off the production line as requests for the jet waned. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 22, 2016 Critics have pointed out that Lockheed’s F-35 and Boeing’s F/A-18 are not comparable since the F-35 is a fifth generation fighter, while the Super Hornet is classified as a fourth generation jet. "Generation" classifications generally refer to levels of stealthiness and ability to avoid radar detection.  Defense Secretary James Mattis ordered a thorough analysis to determine whether the F-35C, one of the three F-35 variants, might be more efficiently replaced by the Super Hornet. Mattis’ letter to his deputy requested the review "begin immediately with the results and recommendations made available to inform upcoming budget decisions."  It is not entirely clear how these points were incorporated into the Trump administration’s proposed budget: It called for a $54 billion increase in ‘defense’ spending. This sum would comprise roughly 80 percent of Russia’s yearly military budget.  © AFP 2017/ JOSEPH EID White House: US 'Must Accept' Political Reality That Assad is Syria's President The idea of replacing some of the F-35s with F/A-18s is unique to neither Mattis nor Trump. In November, 2013 the Congressional Budget Office said that by canceling Lockheed’s grip on supplying new aircraft to the US Navy, new F/A-18s would be “sufficiently advanced” to respond effectively to security risks the US is “likely” to encounter in the near future.  What’s difficult to fathom is that amid engine fires and take off issues, "additional cost growth" is entirely possible, per the CBO. Upgraded F/A-18s "would make comparable cost growth less likely." ...

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 31 March 2017 by Military News Boeing 787-10 Dreamliner Completes First Flight Airplane proceeds to comprehensive flight testing before first delivery in 2018 NORTH CHARLESTON, S.C., March 31, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- The Boeing (NYSE: BA) 787-10 Dreamliner took to the skies for the first time today at Boeing South Carolina. The airplane, which is the newest and longest model of the 787 family, completed a successful flight totaling four hours and 58 minutes.  "The 787-10's first flight moves us one step closer to giving our customers the most efficient airplane in its class," said Boeing Commercial Airplanes President & CEO Kevin McAllister. "The airplane will give carriers added flexibility in growing their network routes and build on the overwhelming success of the 787 Dreamliner family." Piloted by Boeing Test & Evaluation Capts. Tim Berg and Mike Bryan, the airplane performed tests on flight controls, systems and handling qualities. The 787-10 will now undergo comprehensive flight testing before customer deliveries begin in the first half of 2018. "From takeoff to landing, the airplane handled beautifully and just as expected," said Berg, chief 787 pilot. "The 787-10 is a fantastic machine that I know our customers and their passengers will love." The 787-10 has won 149 orders from nine customers across the globe including launch customer Singapore Airlines, Air Lease Corporation (ALC), All Nippon Airways (ANA), British Airways, Etihad Airways, EVA Air, GE Capital Aviation Services (GECAS), KLM Royal Dutch Airlines and United Airlines. As an 18-foot (5.5-m) stretch of the 787-9, the 787-10 will deliver the 787 family's preferred passenger experience and long range with 25 percent better fuel per seat and emissions than the airplanes it will replace and 10 percent better than today's competition. The 787 Dreamliner family is a key part of Boeing's twin-aisle airplane strategy, which offers a modern, optimized and efficient airplane family in every market segment. Since entering service in 2011, the 787 family has flown more than 152 million people on over 560 unique routes around the world, saving an estimated 14 billion pounds of fuel.

New car tax rules and TV licence fees to rise - new laws... 2 Brave words from victims of 'sexual deviant' Edward Felix 2 Plans to buy Allestree Hall from Derby City Council and turn... 2 Comments (1) Bosses at Derby's Rolls-Royce are celebrating after one of its well-known engines was used to power a test flight for the newest Boeing plane. The firm has revealed their Trent 1000 TEN engine was used to test the Boeing 787 Dreamliner aircraft – the 787-10. It means Trent 1000 engines have powered the first flights of every version of the Dreamliner – the 787-8, 787-9 and 787-10 – making it a hat-trick of success for the giant firm. The Trent 1000 TEN (Thrust, Efficiency and New Technology) will power all variants of the Boeing 787 and has improved thrust and efficiency, incorporating technologies from Rolls-Royce's Trent XWB and Advance engine programmes. Its environmental performance contributes to the 787 Dreamliner, having half the noise footprint of previous-generation aircraft. Gary Moore, Rolls-Royce, Trent 1000 programme director - who was in North Charleston, South Carolina to see the flight - said: "To have powered the first flights of each version of the Dreamliner is a great honour. "The Trent 1000 engine continues to show real momentum in the marketplace, winning more than 60 per cent of engine competitions over the last six years. READ MORE NEWS: This man leapt into canal to save people after Swarkestone crash "The improvements that are represented in the Trent 1000 TEN reflect our continued commitment to providing the very best engines for this aircraft family." The Trent 1000 TEN engine began its own flight test programme last year, powering a Rolls-Royce Flying Test Bed aircraft, based in Tucson, Arizona. It was then put through its paces on a Boeing 787-8. In the 10 years since the first Trent 1000 engine was made, it has flown more than 750 million miles.

The flight took off at 9:30 a.m. local time and landed at 2:35 p.m., just over five hours later. Boeing test & evaluation captains Tim Berg and Mike Bryan piloted the aircraft. The flight reached 20,000 ft. at a speed of 383 kts., or 441 mph. In a post-flight press conference Berg and Bryan said they “enjoyed the whole day. “Berg said, “We had a great plan, we had a great team and we had a great jet. We did exactly what we wanted to and it performed exactly like we thought it would. And that’s about as perfect as it gets for a test pilot.” The weather in Charleston had been dubious through the morning, with heavy cloud cover and spits of rain. At about 9 a.m., the clouds parted and the sun appeared, creating an ideal window for the aircraft’s takeoff. At about 9:20 a.m., the -10 appeared before thousands of Boeing employees and guests and made a slow taxi/photo shoot before rounding the runway start point and commencing with its takeoff into a now clear and blue sky. Boeing rolled out the first 787-10 from its plant in North Charleston, the exclusive site for 787-10 final assembly, in a Feb. 17 ceremony attended by US President Donald Trump. Singapore Airlines is the global launch customer for the 787-10 and has ordered 30 of the aircraft, with intent to buy another 19, according to Boeing VP and GM 787 Airplane Development Ken Sanger. Boeing expects to begin deliveries in the first half of 2018. United Airlines is the North American launch customer and has ordered 14 of the variant, with the first delivery expected in Q4 2018. All totaled, nine customers have ordered 149 787-10s to date, including Air France-KLM (7 on order), Air Lease Corporation (25), All Nippon Airways (three), British airways (12), Etihad Airways (30), EVA Air (18), and US lessor GECAS (10).  The 787-10 is an 18-foot (5.5-m) stretch of the 787-9, and is powered by Rolls Royce Trent-1000 TEN engines. It has a range of 6,430 nautical miles, a MTOW of 560,000 pounds (254,000 kg) and a cruise speed of Mach 0.85. It can seat 330 passengers.    Mark Nensel mark.nensel@penton.com   Print reprints Favorite EMAIL Tweet Please Log In or Register to post comments.

The plane, which sells for US$312.8 million (S$437.2 million) at list price and rounds out a family of three carbon-fibre composite Dreamliners, is being built exclusively at Boeing's factory in North Charleston, South Carolina. The facility is Boeing's only jetliner assembly factory outside of Washington state and, in contrast to the others, is not unionised. Employees and guests at the inaugural flight of the new Dreamliner at the Charleston International Airport, March 31, 2017. PHOTO: REUTERS Last month, the same plane provided a dramatic backdrop for President Donald Trump's visit to the Boeing factory on Feb 17, where he promised to boost US manufacturing and punish companies for moving jobs overseas. Companies in Japan, China, Italy, Sweden, France and Britain produce many of the 787's major components, such as wings, fuselage sections and the rudder. Airlines can choose engines from General Electric of the US, or Britain's Rolls-Royce Holdings. The first 787-10 took off from the runway around 9.38am (9.38pm Singapore time) on an initial flight lasting four hours. The 787-10 is the second and final "stretch," or elongation, of the original 787-8, which debuted in 2011. The 787-10 seats 330 passengers in a typical cabin configuration, 40 more than the 787-9 and 88 more than the 787-8. The 787 family has been a top seller, logging about 1,200 firm orders. So far, the 787-10 has booked 149 orders from nine customers, about 12 per cent of the total of firm orders. The mid-sized 787-9 has captured just over half the total. After spending 2017 in testing, the 787-10 is expected to enter service with airlines in 2018.

The US military is remaining open to new ideas for how the service can continue to innovate. “Anything new,” is within the scope of the military to "entertain," former US Marine and current tiltrotor executive at the Boeing Company John Parker told Military.com on March 29. © AP Photo/ Maya Alleruzzo British Firm Contracted to Develop V-22 Aerial Refueling Variant for US Marines The next wave of science-fiction, futuristic weapons systems might rework the entire notion of what weapons should do in combat. "Nonlethal-type weapons, like sonic waves or sound waves" are just a sample of what Boeing is presenting to the Pentagon. "We’re looking at all sorts of things," Parker told National Interest. "Everything is an option." The V-22 combines the capabilities of vertical lift, like helicopters, and the forward flying motion of jets. The Defense Department initially drew up plans to buy 458 V-22s, according to a Congressional Research Service brief from 2011. In the wake of the Iranian hostage crisis, military analysts said that a new aircraft was needed to shore up capabilities gaps. Namely, the Pentagon wanted a high-speed, vertical takeoff aircraft that could take on longer range missions. “The Osprey’s speed allows for deep penetration missions under cover of darkness," writes Daniel Goure of the Lexington Institute.  According to Bell and Boeing, the makers of the Osprey, the tiltrotor has a range of 1,011 miles. It was introduced in 2007 as the first tiltrotor aircraft. Nevertheless, the aircraft still poses "a number of potential oversight issues" with reliability, maintainability, and perhaps most significantly, "operational suitability," the CRS notes. © AFP 2017/ ROMEO GACAD US Dominates Global Weapons Market, Ranks First In Sales The laser-armed Ospreys could make their way into foreign air force fleets. At a cost of roughly $70 million per aircraft, Boeing may do “another 100 sales” to countries like the United Arab Emirates, Japan, Israel, Qatar, Italy, the UK and Australia, Global Security reported. Veteran V-22 pilots within the US armed forces are becoming scarcer by the day. The number of seasoned aviators within the services has nosedived by about 20,000, from 202,000 to 182,000, Sputnik reported. As a result, military brass have offered retention bonuses to keep air crews from hopping ship to more lucrative roles in the private sector. ...

Tax planning: How to complete all tax work before March 31 NORTH CHARLESTON (SOUTH CAROLINA): Boeing Co's newest and largest Dreamliner model, the 787-10, took off successfully on its first flight on Friday, kicking off a flight test program for the high-tech jet. The plane, which sells for $312.8 million at list price and rounds out a family of three carbon-fiber composite Dreamliners, is being built exclusively at Boeing's factory in North Charleston, South Carolina. The facility is Boeing's only jetliner assembly factory outside of Washington state and, in contrast to the others, is not unionized. Last month, the same plane provided a dramatic backdrop for President Donald Trump's visit to the Boeing factory on February 17, where he promised to boost U.S. manufacturing and punish companies for moving jobs overseas. Companies in Japan, China, Italy, Sweden, France and Britain produce many of the 787's major components, such as wings, fuselage sections and the rudder. Airlines can choose engines from General Electric Co of the U.S., or Britain's Rolls-Royce Holdings PLC. The first 787-10 took off from the runway around 9:38 a.m. ET (1338 GMT) on an initial flight expected to last four hours. The 787-10 is the second and final "stretch," or elongation, of the original 787-8, which debuted in 2011. The 787-10 seats 330 passengers in a typical cabin configuration, 40 more than the 787-9 and 88 more than the 787-8. The 787 family has been a top seller, logging about 1,200 firm orders. So far, the 787-10 has booked 149 orders from nine customers, about 12 percent of the total of firm orders. The mid-sized 787-9 has captured just over half the total. After spending 2017 in testing, the 787-10 is expected to enter service with airlines in 2018. Stay on top of business news with The Economic Times App. Download it Now!

A Boeing 747 jet is parked in front of a Boeing Co. building Tuesday, Dec. 17, 2013, in Seattle. (Elaine Thompson / Associated Press) By Julie Johnsson Bloomberg Twitter Facebook  Email  Reddit  SMS Boeing has a temporary plan to save the iconic but slow-selling 747 jumbo jetliner: buying its own planes and leasing them to cargo haulers. With the effective shutdown by Congress of the Export-Import Bank – which traditionally has helped overseas carriers purchase planes – Boeing lost a key sales tool. Making matters worse, leasing companies have been hesitant to finance a plane with a dwindling customer base. So Boeing is now renting out the massive, hump-backed 747s to cargo carriers in countries such as Russia and Azerbaijan, which increases the company’s exposure to potential defaults on payments. Through the end of last year, Boeing had provided financing valued at $1.26 billion to 747 customers through Boeing Capital Corp., regulatory filings show. That’s about a fivefold increase from the close of 2012. In fact, 747-related loans and operating leases now account for about one-quarter of the portfolio managed by Boeing’s lending arm. As the air-cargo market recovers, the strategy may pay off for Boeing. The manufacturer recently landed a crucial 747 order from United Parcel Service Inc. that could serve as a bridge to the future for the wide-body plane. But tomorrow’s 747 — a symbol of luxury travel when it made its debut with Pan-American World Airways in 1970 — most likely won’t be flying globe-trotting tourists. It will instead haul oversize cargo like oil-drilling equipment as demand fades for bulky four-engine passenger carriers. “We believe in the long-term need for this aircraft,” said George Dimitroff, head of valuations for Flight Ascend Consultancy. “As long as they don’t over-produce, which Boeing aren’t doing at the current rate, we believe there will be long-term demand.” Boeing recorded more than $2.1 billion in losses on the 747-8, the latest version, in 2015 and 2016 as it slowed production to keep pace with dwindling sales. The company received a big boost last year when UPS ordered 14 of the jumbo freighters and took options that would double the original order size. The sale was the largest Boeing has landed for the redesigned 747 since November 2007, according to the manufacturer’s website. It’s unusual – and risky – for a planemaker to buy and lease its own product on a large scale. If the cargo carriers default or don’t renew operating leases, it would be Boeing Capital’s responsibility to line up other customers, a challenge in a niche market. If the plane experiences a greater-than-expected decline in value, Boeing’s earnings or cash flow could be “materially adversely affected,” according to the filing. It’s also a shift for Boeing Capital, which has whittled down its loan portfolio by two-thirds from $12.2 billion at the start of 2004 as the unit shed its ambitions of becoming Boeing’s answer to GE Capital. Since selling the General Electric unit a $2 billion commercial loan portfolio in 2004, Boeing Capital has focused on supporting the company’s aircraft sales and managing a portfolio of loans and operating leases aimed primarily at out-of-production aircraft. The recent spate of 747-related operating leases isn’t a reversal of that strategy, Timothy Myers, president of Boeing Capital, said in an interview. His division stepped in to close the 747 deals after a financier had difficulty lining up equity, Myers said. With cargo traffic growing, he expects to find buyers for those aircraft. “We are in the process of doing that right now: offloading some of those transactions that we’ve done in the past,” Myers said. “This year most likely there will be multiple parties taking those assets.” The Export-Import Bank has been dubbed the “Bank of Boeing” for the backing it has given to aircraft purchases by foreign carriers unable to tap conventional credit markets. But it’s been blocked from providing loan guarantees of more than $10 million because it lacks a board member whose nomination has been stuck in a Senate committee since 2015. Conservative Republicans are opposed to the agency’s mission. “We may step in and support a few more deliveries,” Myers said. “But what we’re trying to do is find more third-party financiers to do that.” Uncertainty over the global economy and freighter demand are complicating that task. Nippon Cargo Airlines parent Nippon Yusen KK announced March 24 that it was canceling its final two orders of the 747 freighter variant, which has a list price of $387.5 million. Although buyers typically negotiate steep discounts, it was “just too big, too expensive,” said Neel Jones Shah, a consultant who formerly headed cargo operations for Delta Air lines. While the four-engine 747 is one of the best-selling jets in Boeing’s history, the latest version has struggled to gain sales as airlines shift to more-efficient twin-engine aircraft for long-range flying. The planemaker had a backlog of just 26 unfilled orders through the end of February, 19 of them freighter models, while its order tally for the year stands at two cancellations. There are also five “white tails” – the nickname for jets built without an airline buyer – taped up and sitting in storage. To market analysts like George Hamlin, the UPS order is a sign of more deals to come, barring a global recession or other market turmoil. That deal alone could keep Boeing’s 747 in production for another four years. A generation of older air freighters will soon need to be retired, and the Boeing jumbo has standout technology, from its fuel-efficient engines to nose that flips open to load oversize freight, said the Hamlin Transportation Consulting president. “UPS is a bellwether or bell cow, whatever term you want to use,” said Hamlin, a former Airbus Group executive. “In the intervening time period with UPS bridging the gap, it’s possible other orders may appear.” Global air freight in January increased by 6.9 percent from a year earlier, down from the 10 percent growth in December but far outpacing the 3 percent average annual pace recorded over the past five years, according to the International Air Transport Association, an aviation trade group. “The 747-8’s future is closely tied to the cargo market, and we’re keeping a close eye on that segment as it continues to show signs of improvement,” said Randy Tinseth, a Boeing vice president for marketing.

Eric Berger - Mar 31, 2017 12:55 pm UTC reader comments 284 Share this story SpaceX's "flight proven" rocket lifts off Thursday from Florida. SpaceX The rocket carried a SES communications satellite. SpaceX The rocket first launched on April 8, 2016, carrying a payload to the International Space Station. SpaceX This was the first re-launch attempt for SpaceX, and it went flawlessly. SpaceX Elon Musk says this validates the concept of reusability. SpaceX Musk also says a 24-hour turnaround of rockets is possible next year. SpaceX A screengrab from SpaceX's webcast shows the booster safely back on Earth. SpaceX Elon Musk had himself a day Thursday. For the first time in history, his company launched a fully reusable first stage of an orbital rocket. Then, for good measure, SpaceX landed that rocket for a second time on a drone ship in the Atlantic Ocean. Finally—because why not, when you're on a roll—he attempted to safely return the $6 million payload fairing at the top of the rocket. Even that met with at least partial success. "This is a huge day," he commented later. "My mind's blown, frankly." Many minds were blown on Thursday as the 10-story tall first stage launched for the second time, hefting a 4,300kg payload on its way to a geostationary orbit about 36,000km above the Earth, and then returning to the planet. Blue Origin has done this with the much smaller, suborbital New Shepard rocket. NASA's space shuttle was mostly reusable—but also the product of a multibillion government program. On Thursday a private company, having invested more than $1 billion of its own funds, reused a large, complicated rocket. Further ReadingSpaceX launches, lands its “flight proven” rocket [Updated] Thursday, Musk clearly felt he had finally pushed spaceflight across the rubicon of reusable rocketry, and permanently changed the aerospace industry, and he said he is now confident the company can reach its goal of 24-hour reusability. "So it has been 15 years to get to this point, it took us a long time," he said. "A lot of difficult steps along the way. This is going to be ultimately a huge revolution in spaceflight." The dawn of commercial space For some in the aerospace industry, such talk does not seem hyperbole. Bobby Braun, who served as NASA's first chief technologist and now serves as dean of the College of Engineering and Applied Science at the University of Colorado-Boulder, said the achievement ranks high in the annals of aviation and aerospace feats. "I think that 50 years from now we'll look back on this day and that's say where commercial space travel began," he said. Braun compared Thursday's reflight of the Falcon 9 rocket to the commercial debut of Boeing's 707 aircraft. This plane, a gamble by Boeing to translate its success as World War II aviation contractor into private air travel, made its first commercial flight from New York to Paris in October 1958. Within a decade air travel exploded in popularity across the country, as metro areas built airport terminals, runways, baggage handling services, and more elements of modern commercial aviation. Reusable rockets have the potential to fulfill the same role for space transportation, Braun said. Revenue passenger-kilometers by year. A revenue passenger-kilometer is flown when a revenue passenger is carried one kilometer. International Civil Aviation Organization While he did not dismiss the achievements of Blue Origin during the last 18 months, when the company flew the same booster five times for short, suborbital flights, Braun said SpaceX's achievement surpasses that in a significant way. A rocket launching an orbital payload, like the Falcon 9 first stage, produces about 10 times as much energy, which has to be reversed during the return to Earth. That requires technologies such as supersonic retropropulsion, the firing of the rocket's engines in an opposite direction at speeds greater than sound. The feasibility of such a technology had been theoretical before SpaceX came along and made it practical. Competition SpaceX, of course, has become a competitor to Boeing in the aerospace industry. Until recently, the major players in aerospace had looked askance at SpaceX, its big-talking chief executive, and the company's sky high ambitions. Now, the company has not only landed eight boosters that have flown to space, it has launched one—and is promising to do the same five or six more times just this year. Reflying the first stage alone saves about 70 percent of the cost of a rocket launch. And the company has plans to eventually recycle its payload fairing and second stages, as well. "I think, hopefully, this will inform the decisions of other space organizations," Musk said Thursday night, during a news conference. "Reusability has been put forth as really too hard, or not really feasible. Now, in order to be competitive in launch costs, I think it's going to be necessary for other companies to do the same thing. Imagine if we were an aircraft company selling aircraft that could be flown many times, and everyone else was selling aircraft that could be flown once, I mean, you know, that's not a very competitive position to be in." Further ReadingI think it’s time to bet on the guys with 21st century rockets After the successful launch Thursday Tory Bruno, the chief executive of United Launch Alliance, a competitor to SpaceX for commercial and national security launches, tweeted "Congratulations" to the company on Twitter, and its president, Gwynne Shotwell (but, notably, not directly to Musk). Bruno's company retweeted the message. But there were no other calls of support from other major aerospace firms, including Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Orbital ATK, Aerojet Rocketdyne, and others. During the news conference Martin Halliwell, the chief technical officer for SES, offered a plausible explanation for what other companies that have not avidly pursued reusability might have been thinking at the time. The rest of the launch industry, he said, is shaking in its boots. "I think it's shaking now," he said. "I really do." Soon, he said, it will become the industry norm to fly used rockets—that flying anything but a new rocket will have lost its present stigma. "My belief is that within 24 months it will be irrelevant whether a rocket has been pre-flown, or not. That's what this means today." Future plans SpaceX hasn't been entirely open about how much work went into refurbishing the Falcon 9 rocket launched Thursday, which had previously flown to space in April 2016. But Musk said the company is finding that turning boosters around isn't too difficult, and from what it has learned in recent months, this is all doable. Still, there are some lessons to be learned from the first stages recovered so far. The Falcon 9's base heat shield needs some work, and the stabilizing "grid fins" have caught fire due to atmospheric heating. To address this problem the company is forging new grid fins from titanium, which can tolerate heating better than the present aluminum-with-thermal-protection fins. The paint also burns off. "There are a bunch of little things, really," Musk said. Further ReadingSunday’s launch could be the start of an annus mirabilis for SpaceX He believes the company has a clear path to his goal for the Falcon 9 rocket, however, a 24-hour turnaround from launch to landing to launch, with no maintenance. He believes the final version of the Falcon 9 optimized for reuse, set to fly late this year or early in 2018, will be capable of 10 flights "with no refurbishment," and 100 flights with "moderate refurbishment." 24-hour turnarounds should come by next year. That would be remarkable. And Elon Musk certainly is prone to overpromising in terms of delivery dates. But on Thursday night it was hard to doubt the immigrant from South Africa who had taken on the bluebloods of the global aerospace industry with a vision of low-cost reusable rockets—and had just validated that entire plan before the world. "If SpaceX and others can do this, it means that humanity can become a spacefaring civilization, and be out there among the stars. This is what we want for the future." Such a dream seemed almost tangible on Thursday night.

The flight schools – Avion Training, part of Avion Group in the Netherlands, International Airline Training Academy (Iata) in Napa, CA, and SAA International (SAA), a subsidiary of Velocity Education, in San Diego, CA – were subject to a rigorous review process before receiving final acceptance to be part of the Boeing Pilot Development Programme network.  “With these three top-tier schools, we are removing the burden of identifying and vetting potential schools for our customers,” said David Wright, Boeing Pilot Development Programme director. “Customers can trust that Boeing has done the leg work so they can focus on what they do best – flying people and cargo around the world.” In order to be considered for the training network, schools must prove a good safety culture, have a good industry reputation and have airline and crew-focused training. “Boeing’s Pilot Development Programme is built to provide customers with qualified first officers that seamlessly integrate into airline operations,” Wright said. “These three schools each bring unique characteristics to the industry to help fill the future pilot demand of Boeing’s diverse customer base.” Boeing will provide routine checks to ensure cadets are receiving Boeing’s high level of training. The Boeing Pilot Development Programme is a fully integrated solution that takes cadet pilots through initial screening, English training, ab initio (basic classroom and flight instruction), jet bridge and type rating training at Boeing Training Providers and Boeing training campuses around the world to ensure an efficient, consistent and effective pipeline for airlines to secure qualified first officers. The 2016 Pilot and Technician Outlook projects a need for 617,000 new pilots in the next 20 years. That equates to a need for nearly 31,000 new commercial airline pilots and more than 33,000 new maintenance technicians globally each year. In its seventh year, the Pilot and Technician Outlook is a respected industry study which forecasts the 20 year demand for crews to support the world’s growing commercial airplane fleet. – TradeArabia News Service Tags: Boeing | Pilot Training | More Education, HR & Training Stories New online marketplace for creative professionals launched Rosatom, Russian universities visit Egypt Bahrain’s business climate 'to woo more foreign investors' Growth prospects now prime reason for job change UAE unveils national strategy for children with disabilities University of Manchester expands presence in Dubai Hyatt in UAE top 15 work places list for 4th year SCA signs deal to narrow gender gap in UAE firms Dubai Holding launches new youth council Aramco launches virtual reality training centre Sedco Holding acquires 50pc stake in Al Yusr schools BTEA hosts gypsum design workshop Fakhro Restaurants Company sponsors scholarship seat Etisalat Academy hosts seminar on Blockchain technology Dubai design institute names new president Tamkeen in deal to boost Bahraini youth skills GCC hiring activity to pick up in H1 ThinkSmart, Polytechnic to create IT jobs for Bahrainis HireRight appoints Mideast account director Biggest education expo kicks off in Dubai Calendar of Events View all events Tools Exchange Rates Weather Forecast BBC World Service Ads Sectors | Information | About Us | Construction & Real Estate Energy, Oil & Gas Finance & Capital Market Industry & Logistics IT & Telecommunication Health & Environment Motoring Retail & Wholesale Travel, Tourism & Hospitality Government & Laws Media & Promotion Back to top Trade News Newsletter Events Business Directory TradeArabia Network Advertising Contact Feedback Privacy Statement Terms of Service Web Feeds

Photographer: Mic Smith Photography LLC/AP Boeing Co.’s newest and largest 787 Dreamliner took wing Friday, dipping and soaring for almost five hours above South Carolina during its first flight. The plane’s drama-free performance brought relief to Boeing officials after delays marred the first Dreamliner’s debut in 2011. The 787-10 even took off nearly 30 minutes earlier than scheduled, at around 9:37 a.m. local time, as if to accentuate the improved development. Stiffer headwinds may lie ahead as the carbon-composite jetliner enters the market next year. The 787-10 figures significantly in Boeing’s efforts to wipe away $27.3 billion in production losses lingering from the Dreamliner program’s rocky beginning. But sales have slowed for larger twin-engine aircraft that ply international routes as cheaper fuel and a glut of similarly sized used Boeing 777s and Airbus Group SE A330s sap demand. The maiden voyage is “a big, big milestone for us and our customers,” Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg said on a company webcast of the event. “We’re bringing innovation to the marketplace.” Boeing’s most technically advanced jetliner is no stranger to the spotlight. The plane made its public debut last month serving as the backdrop for President Donald Trump’s address at Boeing’s North Charleston factory. The aircraft is the third Dreamliner model, an aircraft family boasting hulls made of spun-carbon fiber and cabin-humidity levels that lessen jet lag. It’s the first Boeing plane to be manufactured outside of the Seattle area. Friday’s flight went according to plan as the pilots worked through a check list and positioned the aircraft for photographs taken by a chase plane. “We had a great plan, we had a great team, we had a great jet and we went out and flew it,” Captain Tim Berg said after the flight. Jet Debuts It was the third initial flight in a busy week of commercial-jet debuts. The A319neo, the smallest of Airbus’s upgraded single-aisle jets, also took wing for the first time Friday. Brazilian planemaker Embraer SA celebrated the first flight of its E195-E2 on Wednesday. The 787-10 is the first of three aircraft that Boeing is readying in South Carolina for flight-testing. If the planes perform as expected, the Chicago-based manufacturer will gain a direct competitor to the sleek Airbus A350-900, which is made of carbon-composite panels. “It starts to step on the very crisp, clean new competitor that Airbus has out,” said George Ferguson, senior air transport analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence. The new Dreamliner stretches 224 feet (68 meters), eight feet longer than its European rival, and its cabin capacity of 330 travelers is designed to carry five more people than the Airbus plane. But the A350 has a longer range and has outsold the 787-10, garnering 602 sales to 149 for the Boeing aircraft. While Airbus had the benefit of launching its jet years earlier, the European planemaker has struggled to speed production amid supplier shortages. The 787-10 won a key campaign with Singapore Airlines last month and could pad its order book further if its market entry next year proceeds as smoothly as initial production, Ferguson said. Cash Need Boeing is counting on the 787-10 to mirror the drama-free development of the 737 Max and 787-9, all products of a disciplined process it fashioned for new planes following the delay-plagued debut of the 787-8 nearly six years ago. The new jet is the most expensive Dreamliner yet, with a list price of $312.8 million, and its market entry should coincide with growing profits for the aircraft family. Exclusive insights on technology around the world. Get Fully Charged, from Bloomberg Technology. Sign Up The planemaker has just started to generate cash from its marquee jet after a decade, and will need to record an average profit of about $35 million per plane over the next 779 Dreamliners to avoid having to report an accounting loss for the program. Company executives insist they can get there by combining savings from suppliers with higher pricing on the 787-9 and 787-10 models, the Dreamliners with the greatest profit potential. The variants share about 95 percent of the same design-and-build processes, honed after Boeing’s troubles delivering the initial 787-8 more than three years late in 2011. Doing so meant the newest 787 and its tooling felt familiar to Boeing mechanics in South Carolina. “It’s almost anti-climactic because it just went so smoothly,” Mark Jenks, a Boeing vice president and general manager of the 787 program, said Friday. “This doesn’t happen a lot of times in a Boeing career. We have learned a lot across our development programs.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Berg and co-pilot Mike Bryan took the 787-10 to 20,000 feet and hit a top speed of 288 miles per hour during an excursion that started and ended at Charleston International Airport. “Mike and I just enjoyed the whole day,” Berg said, adding the plane “performed exactly like we thought it would.” Between 5,000 and 6,000 Boeing South Carolina employees watched the takeoff Friday. It marked the first time a Boeing plane has made its debut flight outside of the Seattle area. Boeing will have three of the twin-aisle 787-10s in the test and certification program that is expected to last about a year. The second 787-10 is sitting on the flight line at Boeing’s North Charleston campus and the third is in final assembly. Two of the planes, including the one that flew Friday, will have Rolls Royce engines while the third will have engines built by General Electric. Further flight testing will be conducted in Seattle, with the 787-10 that debuted Friday scheduled to head to the West Coast late next week. On Friday, Berg and Bryan went through a roughly 50-page checklist of items they wanted to test while in flight. “We pushed our plan a little bit because we took off a little early to get more testing done, and the weather cooperated,” Berg said. Weather had been a concern early on, with thunderstorms predicted for early in the day. But takeoff occurred without a hitch at 9:38 a.m., as overcast skies never threatened to scuttle the debut, and the plane made a perfect touchdown at 2:35 p.m. “It was fantastic,” Bryan said of the flight. Boeing’s North Charleston campus will be the exclusive assembly site for the 787-10, because the plane’s mid-body is too large to fit into the modified 747s — called Dreamlifters — that transport plane sections between the local campus and a second Dreamliner facility in Everett. The North Charleston campus also builds the program’s 787-8, the smallest member of the family of planes, and the mid-size 787-9. “Not only does this make Boeing’s South Carolina campus the only site which is home to all three 787 models, it demonstrates that the site has the production flexibility to meet demand from customers,” said Saj Ahmad, chief analyst at London-based Strategic Aero Research. Ahmad said he expects there will be “a revival in interest from other carriers” once the 787-10 enters service in the first half of 2018. Airlines will “look to both lock in positions for future deliveries and also as replacements for aging (Airbus) A330s, which are long in the tooth across the world,” he said. Singapore Airlines will be the first recipient of Boeing’s 787-10 in the first half of 2018. The airline has committed to buying 49 of the jets. United Airlines will be the first U.S. customer to get a 787-10, to be delivered during the second half of next year. Ahmad said he expects the plane to have “a boring but straightforward flight test program, thanks in large part to Boeing’s experience garnered from the 787-8 and 787-9 programs.” To date, Boeing has orders for 149 Dash-10s from nine buyers. At 224 feet in length, the 787-10 has enough capacity to seat 330 passengers. It is a simple stretch of the Dreamliner’s best-selling 787-9 model, and the two airplanes have 95 percent commonality. “We had a strategy of making the Dash-10 as common as possible with the Dash-9, and the reason was to make for a very produceable airplane and a low-risk development program. I think we nailed it,” said Ken Sanger, Boeing’s vice president and general manager of 787 airplane development. Boeing markets the 787-10 as having 25 percent better fuel efficiency and lower emissions than the airplanes it will replace. It is the most expensive Dreamliner at a list price of $312.8 million following a recent 2.2 percent price increase. Boeing is counting on sales of the more expensive wide-body to help chip away at the Dreamliner program’s roughly $27 billion in deferred production costs. “Boeing’s challenge going forward will be to ensure that future pricing, on the back of its recent upward price changes, allows for better margins to eat into its deferred production costs,” Ahmad said. Work on the first 787-10 began off International Boulevard last year, and the first plane left the final assembly plant in January. It is comprised of more than 2.3 million parts made around the world and is capable of flying long-range routes that previously weren’t possible. The planes in the Dreamliner family currently fly 560 routes worldwide. All told, there have been 1,207 orders for Dreamliners, with the 787-9 accounting for more than half of them. Boeing, which chose North Charleston for its second Dreamliner facility in 2009, is one of the area’s largest employers, with more than 7,500 workers.   The new Boeing 787-10 Dreamliner lifts off from the runway for its first flight at Charleston International Airport in North Charleston, S.C., on Friday.

Charles Mudede Today Is the Last Day for Pronto: The city will begin dismantling the system, which consists of 54 stations and 500 bikes, on Monday. Pronto will then spend time in the dark of storage as Seattle looks for a city that will buy it. What to make of all this? Seattle may not be such a big bike town. We have nothing on Portland when comes to that mode of transportation, but Portland has nothing on us when it comes to walking. There might just be in Seattle too much noise about bikes and not enough about pedestrians, who, like Link, have made huge gains over the years. Josh Feit provided the impressive pedestrian data in his 2016 post "Increase in Walking Outpaced All Other Modes of Commuting." 2015, pedestrians were nearly 11 percent of Seattle’s 407,361 commuters, and bikes only 4 percent. Seattle Times's Solution to Seattle's Housing Crisis? Homeownership. The city, says Seattle Times commentator Brier Dudley, should not upzone and build more apartments. It should instead encourage homeownership, because that kind of living "provides stability, the opportunity for upward mobility and true affordability over the long term." Do you know what this sounds like? It sounds like someone who missed the housing crash of 2008—missed the collapse of George Bush's "Ownership Society," missed the bubble it created, and missed the millions of foreclosures after the bubble burst. Yes, the city has an affordability crisis, and it is also true that the fast-growing housing market, as it is currently managed and modeled, will not provide nearly enough places for people who earn reality wages. But the solution is certainly not to stop building and to sing the praises of homeowners, who Dudley sees as paying for all this livability-diminishing density with their property taxes. (No word is mentioned about how home loans are only possible with enormous government support or of the huge federal-level tax breaks homeowners enjoy.) In short, Dudley is talking/writing/singing nonsense. Also "urban workers all living in apartments near their office towers" is not, as he maintains, a "Utopian vision"; it is a concrete utopia. It exists in many parts of the world that is here and now. A Weak Tornado Visited Monroe, Washington Yesterday: Though it hurt no one, it managed to rattle some human and tree souls, toss some trash about, knock down two RVs, one of which flattened a car. Its time in the town, which is not far from Echo Lake, was, thankfully, brief. Performer Falls From Swings During Cirque du Soleil Event in Redmond:She was flying through the air in the middle of a swing-to-swing act. Something went wrong up there and she fell down, fell on her back. She was taken away on a gurney, and the show did what all shows must do in situations like this: go on. Month of May Will Bring Another Wave of Job Cuts at Boeing: Money going to jobs instead of profits has always been a big problem for the owners of companies. The CEO of Boeing, Kevin McAllister, knows all about this problem. He feels it very deeply. He has vowed to "aggressively" cut spending in the Puget Sound region in 2017. Money must not behave like objects under the laws of gravity. It must go up, not down. Puget Sound Business Journal reports that Boeing recently filed for the elimination 245 positions that are bringing lots of money down to earth. The Atlanta Horror: After a massive fire destroyed a bridge on a highway that carries 250,000 cars a day, transportation experts in Atlanta are concerned that "many commuters in some of Atlanta's densely populated northern suburbs will have to find alternate routes or ride public transit." The bridge will not be repaired any time soon. Indeed, its destruction may transform the whole city of Atlanta, which, like LA, is often seen by urbanists as all that's wrong in the 100-year marriage between cars and the city. Cherry Blossoms at University of Washington Remind Us of the Transience of Beauty and Life: ワシントン大学の桜 (cherry blossoms at University of Washington) https://t.co/Inxo2xkj4K — ノマディック・リアジェット32 (@nomad_ozland) March 31, 2017 And now for a Japanese ghost story that involves a cherry tree. It's called "A Tale of Ingwa", and can be found in a book, In Ghostly Japan, by the great Lafcadio Hearn. Set in the house of a daimyo (a feudal ruler), the story concerned an old woman who was dying and a young woman who was taking care of her (both were married to the same man). After being ill for three years, the old woman (she is not named in the story) realized that the end had arrived, she was going to die at any moment. She called for the young woman (she is named Yukiko) and made a final request. The cherry tree in the garden was in full bloom and she wanted to see the flowers one last time. Yukiko, of course, agreed to fulfill the old woman's final wish. Pleased, the old woman asked Yukiko to turn around so that she could hold on to her back for support. Yukiko dutifully offered her back. The old woman then put her hands onto Yukiko's shoulders, rose up from the bed, and, step by slow step, was led to the tree in the garden. But once there, the old woman did not look at the blossoms; she instead shoved her hands into Yukiko's kimono, grabbed her breasts, and yelled, "I have my wish for the cherry-bloom in the garden! Such a delight!" After that, she died. But when she died, her hands did not release Yukiko's breasts. The husband returned home and saw in the garden the dead old woman clinging to his young wife. He tried to remove the fingers, but each attempt drew blood. A doctor was called to the house. He examined the hands and the breasts, and he saw that the old flesh had fused with the young flesh. The only thing he could do was cut the hands off at the wrist. The operation was difficult (the old woman's skin was rough and tough) and very messy (pus and blood spilled all over the floor). But that was not the end or the worst of it. Yukiko not only had to spend the rest of her life with the darkened and dried hands on her breasts, but now and then they would come alive and squeeze her breasts in that calculating way a shopper squeezes ripe fruit in a grocery store. This happened sometimes in the morning and other times at night—these dead things drawing devilish delight from the living. 17 You might also be interested in these: Sponsored: Seattle's Best Event App Just Got Even Better!

(MU) Stock Is Only Getting Started Nokia Corp (ADR) (NOK) Stock Is Doing Everything Right Valeant Pharmaceuticals Intl Inc (VRX) Stock May Be Healthy for Long-Term Investors View All Posts Given the higher spending by the U.S. Defense Department, defense contractors should continue growing revenue this year. For the Boeing Company (NYSE:BA), winning billion-dollar-plus orders in the aviation space and the army virtually secures the Boeing dividend yield of 3.2%. This makes BA stock ideal for income investors seeking some underlying capital growth appreciation. Source: Phillip Capper via Flickr Big Orders for BA Stock On March 21, Boeing won a $1.4 billion contract with BOC Aviation, a Singapore-based aircraft leasing firm. The week before that, on Mar. 16, the U.S. Army award Boeing with a $3.4 billion contract. The Army is buying 268 Apache helicopters. The remanufacturing process may result in a faster delivery time and lower operational costs for Boeing. The big contracts followed Morgan Stanley’s downgrading of the stock on March 13. Since the bearish note, BA stock fell from a yearly high of $185.71. With a healthy backlog, strong cash flow and solid growth, Boeing’s business appears prosperous. If the downtrend on the stock continues, valuations will get even more compelling. The stock’s forward price-to-earnings ratio is a bit over 17 while the PEG, or P/E to growth, is a comfortable 1.29 times. Value investors may want to heed the analyst’s bearishness, since the stock is up close to 34% in the past year. Much of the gains may be due to the anticipation of President Donald Trump raising defense spending and homeland security. The flow of money away from international aid and environmental protection and towards security. The secular shift in the political policy may lead to higher orders for Boeing. Related Investments The tailwinds aren’t just helping BA stock soar. Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) is valued at similar price multiples to Boeing. The jet fighter maker opened a new F-35 production facility in Johnstown, Penn. Its CEO, Marillyn Hewson, expressed optimism over the company’s prospects. She cited favorable Trump administration goals and high demand from international customers as reasons for the positive tone. LMT shares have a dividend yielding around 2.7%. United Technologies Corporation (NYSE:UTX), whose shares pay a dividend yielding around 2.4%, said in January it would not make any big M&A (merger and acquisition) deals this year. It is spending more on R&D, particularly in the CCS and Otis units. The company also reaffirmed its guidance when it reported Q4 results on Jan. 25. Trump’s defense spending is a clear tailwind for BA stock and for Lockheed and United Technologies. However, ahead of the policy announcement, markets priced in the higher aerospace spending by government. To resume its upward march higher, Boeing also needs airliners ordering new planes. As they retire older aircrafts, airlines will order Boeing 757, 767, and 797 models. The 797 model is, of course, in development. It may begin flying in 2025. For long-term investors of BA stock, the new plane will ensure Boeing stays competitive. The risk of delays and higher costs is worth securing its place in the aerospace industry. Takeaway on BA Stock Boeing continues to trend towards yearly highs, ever since its shares jumped after the elections in November. A pullback would give value investors an entry point. If lawmakers and opposition curb the boost in spending, Boeing’s stock may fall. Yet any dip in BA stock is welcome because it lets investors buy it at cheaper levels. As of this writing, Chris Lau did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Alex Davies Transportation Date of Publication: 03.31.17. 03.31.17 Time of Publication: 7:30 am. 7:30 am Boeing’s Test Protocol for New Planes Is as Brutal As You’d Hope If Boeing learns anything from today’s maiden flight of the 787-10 Dreamliner today, it means something has gone wrong. That’s because the planemaker has left the Wright brothers’ system—build something, throw it off a sand dune, observe—far in the past. Instead, the company’s engineers have spent the past five years testing, tormenting, and torturing every last scrap of metal on its latest widebody commercial jet destined for customers all over the world—before letting it leave the ground. Today’s maiden flight is a milestone more than anything, signaling the new jet is ready to take off—and endure yet more testing. “Today is about getting the plane up in the air,” says Frank Rasor, who runs flight testing for all Boeing aircraft. “We won’t learn anything in a first flight.” In this case, ignorance is bliss. Measuring 244 feet from nose to tail and listed for a cool $306 million, the 787-10 is the latest, longest variant of the 787 Dreamliner. The twin engine jet’s 7,400-mile range won’t take it quite as far as its shorter siblings (it follows the 787-8 and 787-9), but it seats 330 passengers, 90 more than can sardine into the 787-8. Boeing built the plane to battle Airbus’ A350-900 in the growing Middle Eastern market. The 787 itself, launched in 2011, is still among the most advanced jets on the planet, built from lightweight carbon fiber and stuffed with the latest in aviation tech. Each pilot gets a head-up display, the plane spots and counters turbulence, and offers extra large windows. Boeing plans to deliver the “Dash 10” starting next year, but first, it’s got to prove its mettle. Take Off Eric Adams The New X-Plane Flight Sim Is So Ridiculously Detailed, It Even Has Catering Trucks Jack Stewart Flight Lab: Watch as I Flunk NASA’s Brutal Test Pilot Training Course Alex Davies Thank These Riveting Robots for Planes That Don’t Fall Apart That testing process is baked into the development process, starting at the most basic level. Before attaching a bolt to a nut, Boeing engineers will hammer at each bit until it breaks, gauging material strength. As the myriad components take shape, they undergo their own rigorous tests. As each piece secures approval, it moves up into a larger system, which then faces its own test: Landing gear takes the full impact of a landing without leaving the ground. That process takes the plane all the way to the runway for a taxi test, where the pilot accelerates to 100 mph—just shy of takeoff speed—before slamming the brakes so hard, they glow orange with heat. Today’s flight out of Boeing’s Charleston, South Carolina plant (takeoff time is TBD, weather depending) signals the final stage of testing. At last, Boeing will test the plane as a whole, in the air where it will spend its life. “It’s about the ultimate system integration testing,” Rasor says. For this maiden voyage, the two test pilots—no passengers for the inaugural flight—will take it easy on the plane. They’ll fly at a casual 300 mph (max speed is twice that), moving up and down between 10,000 and 15,000 feet. They’ll spend four hours aloft, testing systems like the flaps and landing gear, before touching down back at the plant. All the while, a team on the ground will crunch reams of data far beyond what any pilot needs, making sure everything, down to the speed and movement of the wingtip, checks out.

The test pilots will take it all the way to “dive speed” and up to its 40,000 foot ceiling, introducing new challenges with each flight. No one will repeat test pilot Tex Johnston’s famed barrel roll in the Boeing 707—the days of unauthorized aerial tricks are long dead—but the crews will push the new jet to climb nearly vertical, banking hard enough to empty even the most iron of stomachs. They’ll fill up water ballast tanks to make the plane heavier, and fly as slowly as they can, to see how the plane handles stalls, when it’s no longer generating enough lift to stay airborne. For a brand new kind of plane, the regimen demands 4,000 to 5,000 hours in the air, in a series of roughly four-hour flights. Because the 787-10 is just a variant of the 787, it gets cleared for service  after about a quarter of that. Instead of retesting every component it shares with the other members of the 787 family, which are well proven at this point, Boeing will focus on what’s different. Here, that means the handling and speed tests, because the plane’s longer body changes how it acts in midair. Because Seattle isn’t the world’s roughest place to fly, Boeing takes the plane abroad: to the baking heat of the Arizona desert, the high altitude of Bolivia, the humidity of Curaçao, the frigid temperatures of northern Russia, and the brutal crosswinds of Iceland. So the first time you climb aboard the new bird, treat it real nice. After all, it’s been through a lot.

With the international sanctions now gone, Tehran wants to overhaul its fleet of passenger planes. ​Russian President Vladimir Putin said Tuesday that talks were underway about exporting Superjet 100 passenger planes and medical helicopters to Iran. "The agenda includes possible deliveries of modern medium-haul planes, Sukhoi Superjet 100s, and medical service helicopters to Iran," Putin said after meeting his Iranian counterpart Hassan Rouhani in Moscow. In an interview with Sputnik Persian, RusIranExpo Company CEO Alexander Sharov was optimistic about the Superjet’s future in Iran. © Flickr/ SuperJet International Iran Interested in Joint Production of Sukhoi Superjet 100 With Russia - Trade Minister“Even though Airbus and Boeing have signed a raft of legally-binding export deals with Tehran, thus far only three of the 180 Airbus jets have been supplied. The situation with Boeing is equally lackluster and only a couple of five- and six-year-old Bombardier jets have so far been delivered to Iran,” he said. The resumption of negotiations for the purchase of Superjet 100s by Iranian companies means that the Russian manufacturer is ready to supply high-quality aircraft for less than what is offered by Western companies, Sharov noted. “In terms of quality/price ratio our planes are better,” Sharov said. He added, however, that the Western manufacturers offer better financing and insurance terms. “They also have at their disposal frozen Iranian assets, so they will have no problem supplying planes registered in the West. For example, the Airbus jets already delivered to Iran are registered in Ireland.” The SSJ100 is a twin-engine plane made by Russia's Sukhoi Civil Aircraft Company. It can transport up to 98 passengers at a distance of up to 2,700 miles, and costs around $36 million in its basic configuration. The jet made its maiden flight in May 2008. © Sputnik/ Sergey Guneev Growing Iran-Russia Ties Developing Into Strategic Relations - RouhaniAlexander Sharov also mentioned the importance of building a direct rail link with Iran, which would serve the two countries’ everyday transport needs and could also meet those of the New Silk Road economic project: “First of all, we need a direct and  wide-gauge rail line running to the Iranian border and then connecting with the country’s narrow, European-gauge, rail system. This would effectively end Iran’s economic isolation. All they now have is a ferry line to Turkey across Lake Van. Even the famous Orient Express, which runs from Budapest to Tehran, needs a ferry to cross the Bosphorus Strait on a train ferry to get from Europe to Asia and back.” He added that a transit route across Azerbaijan would provide a direct railway link to Iran. “We could even talk about the New Silk Way project because with the high cost of transit via Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan cargoes have to be shipped by sea,” Alexander Sharov said.

OPINION Letters Comment ePAPER CLASSIFIEDS World's oldest spacewoman sets spacewalking record Tech Talk Associated Press 1 of 5 This NASA TV video grab shows US astronaut Peggy Whitson(L) and Shane Kimbrough outside the International Space Staion on March 30, 2017. AFP / NASA TV / Handout Cape Canaveral, Florida: The world's oldest and most experienced spacewoman, Peggy Whitson, broke another record Thursday as she floated out of the International Space Station to set up a new parking spot. It was the eighth spacewalk of her career, the most ever performed by a woman. Whitson and her spacewalking partner, station commander Shane Kimbrough, ventured out to complete prep work on a docking port. Kimbrough disconnected the port during a spacewalk last Friday and then flight controllers in Houston moved it to a new location Sunday. It will serve as a parking spot for commercial crew capsules under development by SpaceX and Boeing. The spacewalkers needed to hook up vital heater cables to the docking port and install shields to protect against strikes by micrometeorites. "You guys be safe and enjoy your time out," French astronaut Thomas Pesquet radioed from inside the space station. This will serve as the second of two docking ports for the future SpaceX and Boeing crew capsules. SpaceX will launch the final piece of this particular port later this year or early next year. Midway through Thursday's spacewalk, Whitson will surpass the current record for women of 50 hours and 40 minutes of total accumulated spacewalking time, held by former space station resident Sunita Williams. Williams is one of four NASA astronauts who will make the initial test flights of the SpaceX Crew Dragon and Boeing Starliner capsules. The first flight could occur as early as next year. The 57-year-old Whitson has been in orbit since November. This is her third space station stint. Altogether, she's spent more than 500 days off the planet, also more than any other woman. She's scheduled to return to Earth in June, but may stick around an extra three months, until September. NASA is hoping to take advantage of an extra seat in the Russian Soyuz spacecraft that's due to launch next month and return in September. A decision is expected soon. NASA, meanwhile, has indefinitely delayed a spacewalk that had been scheduled for next week. A shipment containing replacement parts needed for that spacewalk is on hold because of rocket concerns at Cape Canaveral, Florida; the delivery should have been there by now. Shipper Orbital ATK is relying on the United Launch Alliance's Atlas V to haul up the goods. 1 of 5 Read more on this story More Tech Talk Apple cuts prices on lower-end iPads, releases red iPhones Chinese court rules in favour of Apple in local design patent disputes Coming soon, paying your tab without giving your credit card Facebook's Messenger app adds live location-sharing Facebook's Messenger app to allow live location-sharing Google's YouTube losing major advertisers upset with videos McDonald's tests mobile ordering before national rollout Spacewalking French, US astronauts to upgrade orbiting lab Stephen Hawking appears as hologram in Hong Kong Tech world debate on robots and jobs heats up NEWS BAHRAIN MIDDLE EAST WORLD BUSINESS BAHRAIN MIDDLE EAST INTERNATIONAL SPORTS FOOTBALL CRICKET F1 OTHER SPORTS ENTERTAINMENT HOLLYWOOD BOLLYWOOD TV CELEBS REVIEWS LEISURE SCENE CINEMA TECH TALK HEALTH MOTORING OMG OPINION LETTERS COMMENT ePAPER CLASSIFIEDS ADVERTISE TERMS OF USE READERS POLICIES PRIVACY POLICY ABOUT US CONTACT US GULF DAILY NEWS P.O.Box 5300, Manama, Kingdom of Bahrain NEWSROOM Phone: +973 17 620 222 Fax: +973 17 622 141 Email: gdnnews@gdn.com.bh ADVERTISING Phone: 973 17 293 131 Fax: +973 17 293 400 Email: alison.lillywhite@tradearabia.net CLASSIFIEDS Phone: +973 17 299 110 Email: classifieds@tradearabia.net SUBSCRIPTION Phone: +973 17 290 000 Email: gdnhd@tradearabia.net ©Copyright 2017 gdnonline.com - Kingdom of Bahrain.

PUBLISHED : Friday, 31 March, 2017, 3:13pm UPDATED : Friday, 31 March, 2017, 9:13pm Comments:   Howard Yu Share PrintEmail Related topics Management Tesla Motoring Related Articles Companies Generational matters challenge managers 31 Mar 2017 Companies Can your managers manage change? 24 Mar 2017 Companies Managers must offer right mix of rewards to win customer loyalty 24 Mar 2017 Elon Musk has been known as a builder who loves to construct things. He builds Tesla cars that lure buyers from BMW, Maserati and Audi. He founded SpaceX, which manufactures and launches rockets and spacecraft. He opened the Gigafactory, which produces lithium-ion batteries, and will be the world’s second-largest plant after Boeing. He runs SolarCity, the largest solar energy services provider in America. A sceptic of artificial intelligence, Musk has long scoffed the idea of letting the powerful technology only be controlled by a small group of elite scientists or government bodies. He founded OpenAI, a billion-dollar non-profit, to work on safer artificial intelligence, as he once solemnly warned that artificial intelligence could be “potentially more dangerous than nukes”, and likened it to “summoning the demon”. On Monday this week, Musk launched yet another company called Neuralink, aiming to implant tiny electrodes in our brain to directly flash data to and from our consciousness. “Your phone and your computer are extensions of you, but the interface is through finger movements or speech, which are very slow,” Musk told the Vanity Fair. This is a bold response in the age of technological acceleration. Lately, scientists have begun to realise that there is no way that human can keep up with the advancement of artificial intelligence. Millions of years of natural evolution have endowed us with an outsized brain. We possess an unparalleled skill for language and the brilliance to coordinate complex activities, well enough to outcompete every other species on earth. But that natural evolution took eons. Meanwhile, the improvement of computing power, on average, has been doubling every 18 to 24 months. Intel has been delivering on that promise since the mid-60s, and has immortalised it in the name of the company’s co-founder: the Moore’s Law. That is why in recent successions, we saw IBM Watson beat human contestants on the game-show Jeopardy!, and then AlphaGo won the ancient board-game Go against the world champion Lee Se-dol. There is little doubt about whether machines will become smarter than humans. They will. The only dilemma is how humankind will respond. For Elon Musk, our carbon-based wet brain needs an upgrade. For investors at large, however, the most pressing question remains whether Elon Musk is stretching himself too thin. Has his family of companies diversified into too many unrelated businesses? In the ’70s, the idea of conglomerate discount gained rapid popularity among financial analysts. It was a time when private equity was in full swing. Big, lacklustre, publicly listed companies were taken over one by one, often unwillingly, by activist investors. They streamlined, split, and diced the newly acquired companies into simpler, leaner and smaller descendants, with each focusing on fewer businesses. With sweeping changes of top management teams and through the use of highly incentivised compensation, many of the companies were reborn agile and regained market leadership in their own right, and in the process, unlocked shareholder value. That wave of leverage buyouts, hostile takeovers, and divestment proved to be so powerful that the idea that complicated businesses are always bad took root in all financial analyses. Other than exceptions like GE and Johnson & Johnson, companies that don’t have a narrow focus are punished with a discount on their stock price. If Wall Street analysts can’t pigeonhole a company, it is probably a bad company, so the thinking goes. Tesla is valued at more than US$45 billion, worth more than Nissan Motor, and only a few billion shy of the reigning queen of Detroit: Ford Motor To be sure, Tesla is not exactly a conglomerate, as SpaceX and Neuralink are operating as separate entities. But within Tesla, as a carmaker, the scope of its operation is bewilderingly wide compared to General Motors, Ford or Toyota. As of November 2016, Tesla’s market share in cars and light trucks was a tiny 0.3 per cent. During the year, some 76,000 vehicles rolled out of the factory. Ford’s F-Series alone sold 780,000 units in 2015. And yet, at Tesla’s Palo Alto headquarters, visitors can marvel at the myriads of manufacturing activities that the company carried out in-house, including operations that a traditional carmaker would outsource for reasons of staying focused. Although the batteries inside a Model S might resemble those found in a laptop, Tesla sought to master battery chemistry first-hand. Its Gigafactory in Nevada is set to produce batteries at a scale that far exceed the current capacity of today’s global supply chain, ready to drive down production costs to a level the world has not yet seen. SolarCity, a seemingly unrelated manufacturer of solar panels, was also merged into Tesla in November last year. And the financial markets love it. Tesla’s stock has risen more than 40 per cent over the last four months. The company is valued at more than US$45 billion, worth more than Nissan Motor, and only a few billion shy of the reigning queen of Detroit: Ford Motor. All this means that the conventional wisdom that a company should focus on existing core competencies or current business lines in order to achieve a stock premium looks downright ludicrous. Kodak did have a singular focus and look what happened to it. And one can theoretically argue that Tesla is enjoying a conglomerate premium rather than a discount, precisely because it is building critical capabilities to reinvent a century old industry. The mastery of energy storage in car batteries or at home, energy generation by solar cells, and an energy delivery system via superchargers are arguably keystones to upgrading our current mobility system. Only with a combination of these critical capabilities can we hold out hope of creating sustainable transport that can power the 21st century. Where Tesla would persist in operations is where the current supply chain underperforms, turning in-house control of component parts into a real advantage. In the today’s era of abundant cash and capital, managers must therefore ask themselves: ● To what extent are we committed to new capabilities critical to future success? ● As a thought experiment, imagine Elon Musk were to enter your industry, what would he do differently? And if Musk’s Neuralink does materialise, we may one day summon a Tesla by mere thought. Now that’s autopilot for real.

Wilson, a former U.S. representative from New Mexico, would become the top civilian overseeing the Air Force if confirmed by the Senate. Her purview would include weapons acquisitions like the stealthy F-35 jet. Asked if she felt it would make sense to rely on a spruced-up version of the F-18, she said: "As a general matter, the real thing I don't think you can do with an F-18 or an F-15 or an F-16 is give it stealth capability retroactively." Her comments are significant because Trump has suggested buying more Boeing Co F/A-18s, which he called "comparable" to the F-35. This is despite the F-35's status as a stealth aircraft, meaning it is difficult for enemy radar to detect. The 1990s-vintage F/A-18 does not use stealth technology. The U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee hearing on Wilson's nomination touched on expanding the size of the Air Force, acquisitions of new space and cyber warfare capabilities as well as aircraft like the F-35. In January, U.S. Defense Secretary James Mattis ordered cost-cutting reviews of two major aircraft acquisition programs including the F-35. The ongoing review is examining how to cut costs and also determine whether Boeing's F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, with improvements, could be an effective, less expensive alternative to the F-35C variant. Wilson did not delve into new acquisition program specifics during the hearing but said "the Air Force is too small for what the nation expects of it." She is the first civilian head of a military branch to testify before the Senate this year. Nominees for the Army and Navy have removed their names from consideration. A graduate of the U.S. Air Force Academy, Wilson has been president of the South Dakota School of Mines & Technology since 2013 and said during her testimony that her nomination was "unexpected." The Senate must hold a vote to confirm Wilson as the secretary of the Air Force.

BOC Aviation said it bought the aircraft from subsidiaries of Boeing Co and concurrently accepted an assignment of the leases of the aircraft to cargo airline AirBridgeCargo Airlines LLC. The actual purchase price was lower than the list price, and the deal was funded through cash on hand, loans and other borrowings, the Hong Kong-listed firm said in a filing. BOC Aviation earlier this week posted a record full-year net profit, supported by growth in global air travel, and signaled an upbeat outlook.

Initially planned for five years, the recovery plan will finally last a period of seven years and will be aligned with the duration of the financing of the bank pool, the company explained. According to a statement to APA on Monday, the plan, with the help of experts from the American firm Boeing Consulting, will involve anticipating the deployment of cargo activity” with “A cargo Division”, which will include adding to the Camair-Co fleet a Boeing 737-400F freighter to generate new revenues by tapping into the potential of countries in the region. With this in mind, Camair-Co announces an increase in the frequency of domestic flights from 70 to 100 per week, with an intensification of its service in the north of the country and the opening of the new routes. With a view to successfully implementing this improved stimulus plan, Camair-Co just acquired two aircraft under lease, added to the implementation of a policy to reduce the company’s expenses. From this standpoint, for 2017 the plan projects savings to the tune of CFA16 billion, which has begun to be realized through the “relocation of the company’s headquarters to its own premises, the temporary suspension of unprofitable services, the reduction of 21 percent of its payroll.” Two years ago, Ecobank was already the leader of a banking pool that mobilized CFA25 billion for Camair-Co, a company still struggling six years after the launch of its operations.

With real estate at 35,000 feet becoming increasingly more expensive, the Hong Kong carrier has found that its roomy nine seats per row arrangement is simply no longer viable. Cathay Pacific must push ahead with its restructuring By no means was Cathay the first the come to such a conclusion. Several years ago, Air Canada faced similar financial hardship and managed to turn itself around by trading comfort for profit. The Canadian carrier increased the number of seats to 10 per row in economy class, cutting costs by 15 per cent in a single stroke. On its Hong Kong-Vancouver route, Cathay’s Boeing 777 can carry up to 275 passengers, however, far more of the plane is taken up by spacious premium economy, business and first class seating. Meanwhile, Air Canada can fit 450 passengers onto the same aircraft and with more lower-priced tickets available, finds it easier to fill the flights. “Their average cost per seat mile is lowered today by going to a higher density configuration. For [airlines], it’s one of the few ways to compete,” Raymond Kollau, founder of aviation consultancy Airline Trends, said. “Ten seats is the standard. “These carriers have had no other choice but to compete with passengers in economy, and now Asia is following. It is either fierce competition or trouble at home... now they have no other choice to densify economy.” Size matters when it comes to Hong Kong air travellers Almost all major airlines have beaten Cathay to increasing density in economy class, albeit at the discomfort of passengers. Emirates Airlines was the first to bring the squeeze, and others soon followed: Air France, American Airlines, Air Canada and China Airlines. Taiwan’s Eva Air opted for the tighter layout halfway through its latest delivery of new Boeing 777s. Singapore Airlines, like Cathay, is the exception to the rule and has so far not added the extra seat. But the strategy has found the airline in a similar financial predicament as the Hong Kong carrier. “If you can’t beat them, join them,” Kollau said. Being behind on economy class density has undermined and eroded Cathay’s dominant position at Hong Kong International Airport, where it controls almost 50 per cent of take-off and landing slots. Will Horton from the Centre for Aviation (CAPA) said Cathay’s competitors could fly more passengers on the same plane, yet do so at a lower cost and make more money. Now, the beleaguered Hong Kong airline has been left at a “competitive disadvantage”. A DIFFICULT 2016 With Cathay recording losses of HK$575 million in 2016, management is bracing for the biggest overhaul of the company in 20 years. Contributing to the loss was lower than average business class customers, heightened competition from cheaper Chinese carriers and declining visitor numbers in Hong Kong. It also encountered geopolitical and economic headwinds, and is still feeling the pain of its fuel hedging strategy. Still, passengers continued to flock to the airline. Cathay Pacific recorded a healthy load factor – a measure of how full flights are – of 84.5 per cent in 2016. Despite the good result, Cathay was still short on breaking even. The airline’s chairman, John Slosar, alluded to the task ahead during the company’s annual results release. “Mainland Chinese airlines increased their global reach,” he said. “We have to find ways to attract customers to fly with Cathay Pacific. We can operate in lower cost, be more agile and provide better service to our customers.” Adding 10 per cent more seats to economy class and cutting 30 per cent of the airline’s staff costs at its headquarters are crucial elements of the airline’s three-year restructuring plan. IN SEARCH OF PROFITS Cathay Pacific has arrived late to the party and fallen behind its rivals by not yet increasing density in economy class. In fact, Cathay is feeling the pressure across all sections of the aircraft. At the front of the plane, fewer Cathay travellers have been willing to fork out the money for a business or first class seat, while its spacious economy class is as full as ever. Adding extra seats would “definitely help” the airline return to profit at a marginal additional cost, Geoffrey Cheng, head of transportation and industrial research at Bank of Communications International Holdings (BOCOM), said. His comments reflect a wider belief among aviation industry observers that Cathay Pacific has simply been too slow to make more money from its long-haul travel. Achim Czerny, an associate professor in aviation management at Hong Kong Polytechnic University, said the airline was playing catch-up. Hong Kong Cathay Pacific passengers to feel the squeeze in push for profits “By adopting the strategy, you’re not getting ahead, but if you adopt a successful strategy, you are not being left behind,” Czerney said. “In this environment it makes a lot of sense and is a sensible strategy.” However the airline sincerely believes it can catch up and get ahead of the competition. “We are not alone. Actually, we are late in the game... But the overall customer experience is a lot more important than whether it’s a 3-4-3 or a 3-3-3 configuration,” Paul Loo, Cathay’s director of corporate development and IT, told analysts during the results release earlier this month. Cathay Pacific reports first loss since 2008 as rivals’ cheaper fares erode margins STILL A “5-STAR” AIRLINE? Cathay Pacific has long been known for premium and quality and is one of only nine airlines in the world to be classed as a “five-star airline”. The elephant in the room, however, is whether an airline can legitimately still be considered “premium” when it has sacrificed passenger comfort for profits by adding the additional seat in its economy class. “Everyone is hoping Cathay Pacific will maintain its premium status, but the reality is if they really want to compete, adding extra seats will lower its average cost per seat and in the circumstances, it’s a fact of life for competition reasons,” BOCOM’s Cheng said. Kollau believed Cathay could retain its premium image in economy, and praised the airline for its unique six-way headrest on the Airbus A350 aircraft. We have to find ways to attract customers to fly with Cathay Pacific. We can operate in lower cost, be more agile and provide better service to our customers Cathay Pacific chairman, John Slosar “I think Cathay can still maintain that attractiveness... besides offering a better economy product, they can combine it with data to make a more personalised service or offering. They do have a good selling point to build on, and for now, they are well positioned,” he said. Fellow “five-star” airlines – Etihad Airways, Qatar Airways and Eva Air – have all made the move to a more cramped cabin. “Whether we believe in premium or not – yes, we are still in the long-haul network premium model,” Loo said. Indeed, the airline would hang on to its premium reputation with passengers if it kept the spacious nine-seat arrangement. However, Cathay is stuck between a rock and a hard place, according to Czerney. The airline is faced with increasing demand and an airport quickly reaching capacity. Hong Kong International Airport hosted 70 million passengers last year alone. “It’s difficult to add new flights to Hong Kong, but there is a lot of growth. What can you do? You can just squeeze in more passengers into an aircraft,” the PolyU academic said. “Because of the growing demand, they may be able to serve more passengers at an even higher price.” Why Hong Kong and Singapore must help their airlines soar At the end of the day, the tighter squeeze in the sky may not be so bad for the Hong Kong traveller. Without more seats in economy class and with all airlines flying out of Hong Kong airport facing the same limitations to growth, pressure would be on carriers to increase airfares. “In the long run it will be successful,” Czerney said. “Why? Because passengers care for the price, so if you can offer more seats at a slightly lower price, you will get the passenger and will also earn more money, and be profitable.” The next challenge on the horizon for Cathay, and other major carriers, is the onslaught of budget airlines offering long-haul flights. And with another runway opening at the Hong Kong airport, Kallau says all carriers would be assessing their position. “It wouldn’t surprise me since they are all feeling the squeeze from the Gulf carriers and next – from long-haul low cost in future,” he said.   Most Popular Viewed 1 US diplomat charged with lying over contact with Chinese agents 2 Ivanka –Trump’s China charmer-in-chief 3 Cathay Pacific to squeeze in more seats in bid to reverse losses 4 Action urged on Hong Kong flat grabs in first-time buys 5 Tillerson warns of US military strike on North Korea Shared 1 US diplomat charged with lying over contact with Chinese agents 2 America’s hidden role in Chinese weapons research 3 Ivanka –Trump’s China charmer-in-chief 4 Cathay Pacific to squeeze in more seats in bid to reverse losses 5 China building navy’s biggest amphibious assault vessel Commented 1 China’s Xinjiang passes law to curb ‘religious extremism’ 2 777: A lesson in numerology for those who hate Carrie Lam 3 Rates will do nothing to burst Hong Kong property bubble 4 Cathay Pacific to squeeze in more seats in bid to reverse losses 5 Action urged on Hong Kong flat grabs in first-time buys       You may also like Society The Indonesian child maids of Hong Kong, Singapore 26 Mar 2017 - 12:36am 12 Your partner in the cloud In partnership with: Alibaba Cloud Opinion Why a Beijing-Taipei conflict would be lose-lose on all levels 25 Mar 2017 - 6:34pm 34 The very best in British Early Childhood Education Sponsored by Mount Kelly International School Politics John Tsang: popular with the people, not with the voters 29 Mar 2017 - 12:15am 25 Politics How Hong Kong’s Carrie Lam went from protester to leader in waiting 25 Mar 2017 - 2:34pm 11 Hong Kong Escalator going ‘twice as fast’: witnesses relive mall accident that injured 18 26 Mar 2017 - 7:21pm 28 News Teenage Singaporean blogger Amos Yee granted asylum in U.S. 25 Mar 2017 - 11:29pm 127 World Chinese elders’ Canada immigration bids bog down in Hong Kong 23 Mar 2017 - 12:58pm 27 China Chinese soccer fans flock to the streets after surprise win over South Korea 24 Mar 2017 - 8:41am 22 China 300 flights axed as Beijing airport shuts runway for repairs 23 Mar 2017 - 11:40pm China Hong Kong hopes for boom from AIIB club 24 Mar 2017 - 12:00am 11 South China Morning Post Stay connected Facebook Twitter Hong Kong Politics Economy Health & Environment Law & Crime Education & Community News China Hong Kong Asia World China Policies & Politics Diplomacy & Defence Money & Wealth Society Economy Tech Business Companies Markets Property Investor Relations Mutual Funds Economy China Economy Money & Wealth Country Reports Tech China Tech Enterprises Social & Gadgets Start-ups Apps & Gaming Innovation Leaders & Founders Science & Research E-Commerce Lifestyle Arts & Entertainment Health & Beauty Film & TV Food & Drink Families Music Fashion & Luxury Books Travel & Leisure Watches Sport Hong Kong China Golf Racing Rugby Soccer Tennis Boxing Comment Insight & Opinion Harry's View Blogs Polls Letters Multimedia Video Photos Infographics SCMP Chronicles Magazine Post Magazine Style Good Eating Destination Macau HK Magazine Archive Other Weather Most Popular 7 Days Index Country Reports Crossword Promotions Directories Luxehomes At your service Business Services Directory MICE Biz Restaurant Directory Information Buy SCMP Photos Copyright Licensing RSS Feeds SCMP.com search Historical Archive Print Subscription Advertising Opportunities Contact our Advertising Sales HK Rate card Overseas Rate Card China Rate Card The Marketer SCMP Marketing Solutions SCMP Outdoor Advertising Recruitment Advertising Events SCMP Events Operation Santa Claus Other Sites CPJobs.com Education Post Young Post Cosmopolitan CosmoGIRL!

Zhenhai Refining and Chemical, a Sinopec subsidiary based in Ningbo, Zhejiang province, said the plant would convert 100,000 tonnes of leftover kitchen oil into 30,000 tonnes of aviation-grade biofuel a year. The fuel would be sold to airlines operating long-haul international flights, especially to countries that charged high emissions taxes, it said. Hong Kong’s Cathay Pacific seeks 80pc emissions reductions on some long flights with big switch to biofuels Although biofuel does not add extra carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, since it originally comes from plants or animals that are part of the biological cycle, some researchers have argued it is not suitable for long-term storage and might constrict or even block fuel flow in pipelines because of its tendency to form a gel at low temperatures. In another blow to its aviation prospects, the US Air Force reported last year that jet fighters using biofuel had been infested by thriving colonies of bacterium that threatened the safety of mechanical and electronic components. But Zhenhai Refining spokesman Huang Zhongwen told the South China Morning Post passengers need not worry because the new fuel would be “absolutely safe” for planes, adding that it would also not smell like a kitchen. Sinopec, China’s largest oil company, started the project in 2011 as a countermeasure to a carbon tariff on civil aviation proposed by the European Union. The first sample product was synthesised in a Sinopec laboratory the following year but the biofuel was not used in a commercial flight until March 2015, when a Hainan Airlines Boeing 737 used a 50-50 mix of conventional jet fuel and biofuel to fly 156 passengers from Shanghai to Beijing. “The flight was a one-off; just for show,” Huang said. “The plant, however, means long-term business.” The design of the plant, to be built in Ningbo’s Zhenhai district, was near completion and other preparations were proceeding smoothly and on schedule. Cathay Pacific invests in biofuel developer to meet carbon-neutral growth targets “We have confidence about breaking ground in 2018 ... output will meet the annual demand of certain long-distance flights,” Huang said. He declined to provide the investment cost or what the biofuel would sell for. According to Boeing, a major maker of passenger jet planes, more than 1,500 commercials flights had used biofuel since 2011. These were all for demonstration purposes, however. The world’s 100,000 daily flights still stick to conventional fossil fuel. Using waste kitchen oil was a challenge, said Professor Li Xuebing, a biofuel researcher with the Chinese Academy of Sciences’ Qingdao Institute of Bioenergy and Bioprocess Technology, in Shandong province. “The barrels come in with all kinds of stuff: vegetable oil, animal fat, various proteins, salt, pepper …” he said. But researchers had developed sophisticated technology to filter out the “junk”, Li said. They heated the oil to over 350 degrees Celsius to get rid of water molecules, which might damage jet engines, and added hydrogen to extend the fuel’s shelf life and combustion efficiency. That added to the cost of the final product and made it more expensive than fossil fuel. But Li said the Sinopec’s aviation biofuel had met stringent safety standards. For instance, it did not form a gel at temperatures low as minus 47 degrees Celsius, and its manufacturing process should kill off all sorts of bacteria. Chinese biologist Cui Qiu seeks out productive biofuel sources “Chemically speaking, it should be almost identical to fossil fuel,” he said. “Even better, in fact, on some performance benchmarks.” Sinopec might struggle to find enough raw material, however. Chinese restaurants produce more than five million tonnes of waste oil a year, according to some estimates, but most of that goes down drains and some is sold to underground workshops which recycle it and sell it back to restaurants as cheap “gutter oil”. The use of gutter oil in restaurants has become one of the biggest food safety concerns in China. Li said he was not sure whether the refinery would be able to collect enough gutter oil for mass production. “There is tough competition,” he said.   Most Popular Viewed 1 Racist attacks in India give China the edge in Africa 2 Rise of the 215 sq ft home as HK price boom squeezes buyers 3 Cathay Pacific aims for HK$4 billion in cuts over three years 4 From seat width to toilet ratios, which airlines are most generous? 5 How many ways did North Korea get away with murder?

(CNN) — A 1980s-era combat jet that has long been hailed as the most successful dog-fighting aircraft in US history may have finally met its match. It is not an enemy plane that is threatening to end the F-15 Eagle’s 40-year reign as king of the skies, but rather the US Air Force’s latest cost-cutting efforts. Air Force generals floated the idea of retiring hundreds of F-15s during a hearing before the House Armed Services subcommittee last week, pitching a plan that included replacing the current fleet of battle-tested fighters with an upgraded version of the F-16 Fighting Falcon. The plan would include replacing 236 F-15C and D models by dipping into the Air Force’s inventory of nearly 1,200 F-16s. The future of the F-15E Strike Eagle, which is primarily used in ground attack missions, was not discussed specifically during the hearing. While the Boeing-made F-15 is designed with specific capabilities to out-duel opposing planes in air-to-air combat, Lockheed Martin’s F-16 is a multi-role aircraft, built to carry out a variety of missions. If the F-15 is retired, Air Force top brass told lawmakers that they would outfit the F-16 with new radar systems, prepping it to “serve the same function as the F-15.” “There are capabilities we can add and provide on the F-16 that will [fill] a gap as we go into the future. Overall, our readiness and our protection of the US will change, but I think overall, we will be OK,” said Lt. Gen. Scott Rice, director of the Air National Guard. But several subcommittee members expressed concerns around whether the F-16 can adequately fill the shoes of a tactically specialized jet that boasts more than 100 aerial victories. “If we’re talking about fourth generation assets, you’ve got the F-15C, which prior to the F-22 was the best at air-to-air … the F-16 is an incredible, versatile, multi-role, little bit less expensive sort of decathlete,” said Arizona Republican Rep. Martha McSally, pressing Air Force leaders on the proposal. “Comparing the capabilities side by side … {an F-16} doesn’t bring the same expertise as the F-15 in air-to-air,” she added. Both Rice and Air Force Director of Current Operations Maj. Gen. Scott West confirmed that the proposal was under consideration but also stressed that nothing was final, calling the option “pre-decisional.” The idea also caught some of the subcommittee members off-guard, as McSally said she hadn’t heard about plans to retire the F-15 until told during last week’s hearing. Despite its long history of service, the F-15 continues to see deployments to some of the most tense regions of the world. Last year, the Air Force sent squadrons of F-15s to Iceland, the Netherlands and Finland to reassure NATO allies after Russian military intervention in Ukraine. And 50 Eagles are stationed at Kadena Air Base in Japan as a key part of the US power-projection strategy in the Pacific. The Air Force has turned its attention toward planning its budget for the 2019 fiscal year, but Rice told lawmakers that he did not expect a decision to be made regarding the fate of the F-15 until 2020. The major selling point of dumping the F-15 in favor of the F-16 hinges on cost. Parring down the number of different aircraft models in the fleet would increase combat and maintenance efficiency while providing added budget flexibility, West said. That flexibility could be used to invest in more modern weapons systems as the US technology advantage over potential adversaries continues to shrink. “I think sooner is better given the investments being made by China and Russia are, in particular, pretty significant,” he said. It remains unclear how a plan to retire the F-15 would impact the Air Force’s on-going initiative to invest $12 billion in revamping the F-15 fleet with upgraded radar technology, infrared search and track, and electronic warfare capabilities. These upgrades are expected to extend the life of the F-15 through 2040. The Air Force initially planned to replace the entire F-15 fleet with the fifth-generation F-22 Raptor, but production of the stealthy aircraft was halted in 2009 and only 188 of the 749 F-22s planned by the Pentagon were ever produced. Recent pilot shortages, budget cuts and delays to new platforms, such as the the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, have prompted Air Force brass to call the current force the “smallest, oldest and least ready” in history.

(University of Oregon Archives via AP) (Charlie Riedel/Associated Press) Oregon guard Payton Pritchard (3) celebrates with teammate Dylan Ennis (31) at the end of the Ducks' 74-60 win over Kansas. By ANNE M. PETERSON, Associated Press Published: March 29, 2017, 10:15 PM A   A The historical significance of Oregon’s return to the Final Four was not lost on coach Dana Altman. The Ducks face North Carolina in the national semifinals in Glendale, Arizona, on Saturday. Oregon hasn’t been this close to the title game since the team won the inaugural NCAA Tournament in 1939. Altman called it “a long drought.” Perhaps one that could end this season after 78 years? The Oregon Webfoots won the NCAA title with a 46-33 victory over Ohio State at Northwestern University. The team would become known by the nickname the Tall Firs — a nod to both the Oregon landscape and the fact that the players loomed taller than most of their opponents. The Webfoots’ front line included 6-foot-4 John Dick, 6-foot-4 leading scorer Laddie Gale and 6-foot-8 Urgel (Slim) Wintermute. Guards Bobby Anet, a 5-foot-8 playmaker, and 5-foot-10 Wally Johansen rounded out the starting five. Anet and Johansen grew up on the same street in Astoria, Oregon, and had played together since junior high. Coach Howard Hobson told The Associated Press in 1988 that Anet, who passed away in 1981, was the heart of the Tall Firs. “He was the greatest floor general I ever had,” said Hobson, who also coached at Yale and was enshrined in the Basketball Hall of Fame in 1965. “He sparked the team. He was its leader.” Dick went on to serve 32 years in the U.S. Navy, enlisting the day after the attack on Pearl Harbor on Dec. 7, 1941, and rising to the rank of rear admiral. He was at the final game played at Oregon’s famed McArthur Court in 2011, and pumped his fist for the crowd when he was announced at halftime. He died later that year. Reserve guard Ford “Moon” Mullen went on to play baseball in the majors for the Philadelphia Blue Jays (Phillies) in 1944. Wintermute worked at Boeing. On the way to the first Big Dance , the Tall Firs won the Northern Division of the Pacific Coast Conference, then beat Southern Division champion California in a three-game series. The victory sent Oregon to the regional tournament on Treasure Island in San Francisco Bay, where the team beat Texas, 56-41, and Oklahoma, 55-37, before heading to Illinois for the title game via train. The eight-team NCAA Tournament was founded by the National Association of Basketball Coaches to compete with the National Invitation Tournament in New York. Denver-based writer Terry Frei, who grew up in Eugene and is the son of former Oregon football coach Jerry Frei, wrote a book about the Tall Firs called “March 1939: before the Madness.” “They were so well-coached and they were big along the front line — almost revolutionarily big — and they had racehorse guards, especially the captain guard Bobby Anet, who kept everything in control,” Frei said. “So I think it was a real complementary chemistry-type team far ahead of its time that way.” Dick led all scorers with 13 points in the championship game against the Big Ten champions before maybe 5,000 fans, many of whom were given free tickets. Fans in Eugene listened to the game on the radio — it was the same year John Steinbeck’s “Grapes of Wrath” was published and that “Gone with the Wind” came out in theaters — then later descended by the thousands at the local train station to welcome back the team. “They were largely for the most part small-town boys. Laddie Gale was from Oakridge, two of the starters were from Astoria, Slim Wintermute was from Longview, Washington, and John Dick was from The Dalles,” Frei said. “So there was a small-town feel to the team, small-town heroes who stepped up big.” Frei noted with a laugh that the players got $2 from a kitty to celebrate following the victory. Several of them took a train from the Northwestern campus into Chicago. “I think some of us had a couple of Heinekens or something,” Frei quoted Anet as saying later. “It was quite late and none of us were big on bars or things like that, mainly because nobody ever had any money.” Altman believes this Oregon team is building its own historic legacy. “The seven years we’ve been at Oregon we’ve had great guys to work with. I feel great for those guys that our staff had a relationship with, but I also feel good for all the other players that have built Oregon basketball; 1939 is a long drought, but there are a lot of guys that played and built some tradition at Oregon,” Altman said.

NASA/AP | Caption Loading... Charlie Wood Staff | @walkingthedot March 31, 2017 —It’s a familiar image from sci-fi movies: a vital tool tumbling end-over-end against the star-studded background, close in space but rendered irretrievable by orbital mechanics. Such a scene played out in real life 250 miles above the Earth on Thursday when an important piece of cloth shielding for the International Space Station (ISS) drifted away from two spacewalking astronauts. Fortunately, NASA engineers on the ground were able to come up with a quick fix to keep astronauts, and the $100-billion orbiting research station, safe. Peggy Whitson and Shane Kimbrough were engaged in some station modification when the mishap occurred, installing a docking point in a more accessible part of the ISS in preparation for commercial crew capsules being developed by SpaceX and Boeing. The new space taxis may begin flights as early as next year. “During the spacewalk, which lasted just over seven hours, the two astronauts successfully reconnected cables and electrical connections on the Pressurized Mating Adapter-3,” NASA wrote in a press release. The lost shielding weighs 18 pounds and measures 5 feet by 2 feet unfolded. Mission control tracked the white dot as it receded from view, and concluded that it posed no immediate threat to the space station. The 2-inch thick canvas will orbit the Earth (along with the 21,000 other pieces of space junk NASA currently tracks) before eventually burning up in the atmosphere. Could you pass Astronomy 101? Take the quiz! After the accident, spacewalk support personnel leaped into action, devising and testing a makeshift solution that the astronauts could implement with materials on hand. After installing three shields as planned, Dr. Whitson and Mr. Kimbrough plugged the remaining hole with an unneeded cover they had just removed from the relocated docking port. While not a perfect fit, it should protect the station from small asteroid and debris strikes. "You guys came up with a fantastic plan – on short notice. That's amazing," Whitson radioed back to Mission Control, the Associated Press reports. Objects get dropped remarkably rarely, considering that astronauts have spent a collective 1,243 hours and 42 minutes outside the station during 199 spacewalks. Ed White became the first space litterbug in 1965 when he let go of a glove during the very first space walk. Other items to be lost in space include a spatula, and, perhaps most famously, a 30-pound tool bag full of tools in 2008, which amateur astronomers tracked for months before it met its fiery end. The seven-hour operation was also notable for pushing Whitson into historic territory, overtaking Sunita Williams’s previous record for most time spent spacewalking by a woman: 50 hours and 40 minutes. Whitson now holds the 5th spot in the spacewalk duration ranking, about 30 hours behind the all-time record holder: Russian cosmonaut Anatoly Solovyev with 82 hours spread over 16 spacewalks.

A powered hybrid aircraft generates partial lift by using gases that have average densities lower than that of air (as in lighter-than-air [LTA] airship) and partially from aerodynamic lift (as in a heavier-than-air aerodyne). Hybrid airships can be broadly classified into dynastats and rotastats. A dynastat is a hybrid airship that has a long endurance capacity, requires forward flight to create aerodynamic lift, and has fixed wings. Technavio’s analysts forecast the global hybrid aircraft market to grow at a CAGR of 9.75% during the period 2017-2021. Covered in this report The report covers the present scenario and the growth prospects of the global hybrid aircraft market for 2017-2021.

Posted: Friday, March 31, 2017 1:01 PM EDT Updated: Friday, March 31, 2017 1:32 PM EDT Static display of Virgin Galactic's SpaceShipTwo at Farnborough, United Kingdom on Monday, July 9, 2012. By Jon Ostrower SEATTLE (CNNMoney) -- Virgin Atlantic Airways is still relentlessly cool, but is that enough? Carrying itself as the icon of youth, vibrancy and entrepreneurship, Sir Richard Branson's foray into air travel is 33 years old. Today the airline is an established incumbent, not an irreverent insurgent, and it is facing financial challenges. Virgin's leadership this week said the carrier would lose money in 2017 after four years of full-year profit. It attributed the upcoming loss to the impact of U.K.'s pending exit from the European Union and a sharp drop in the value of British pound. Most of Virgin's costs are paid in dollars, while most of its revenues are in pounds. "British people have difficulty affording to travel now," Branson said. "A hard Brexit will damage the travel industry severely. I just hope that sanity will prevail and that if it's going to damage Great Britain and the travel industry that somebody would own up to that fact." The airline touched down in Seattle this week with new service from London, its first new city in two years. At a press event, Branson wore a red flannel shirt -- an ode to Seattle's long-departed grunge scene. He stepped off a mood-lit Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner flight flanked by the airline's flight attendants wielding Union Jack umbrellas. Four years ago, Delta Air Lines bought a 49% stake in Virgin for $360 million from Singapore Airlines. The partnership allows Delta and Virgin to closely coordinate schedules and pricing across the North Atlantic. For example, in starting the route to Seattle, Virgin ended flights to Detroit, and Delta took over the route to London. Willie Walsh, the CEO of British Airways' parent company, famously bet Branson "knee in the groin" in 2012 if Virgin Atlantic's brand survived five years of Delta's influence. But the odds are not in Walsh's favor. Seattle was the first of three new flights launched by Virgin this week, including links from Manchester to Boston and San Francisco. "We are flying on," said Branson, "We're certainly not sitting still." Virgin is waging a war of many fronts. A trio of Middle Eastern airlines has matched its upscale passenger experience and a rapid U.S. expansion by European low-cost airlines is driving down fares across a crowded North Atlantic. Virgin Atlantic is only one part of the global Virgin brand, which touches everything from mobile phones to trains and hotels, gyms, banking and eventually space tourism. "Virgin Atlantic has carried the brand for quite some time," said Craig Kreeger, Virgin Atlantic's chief executive. Virgin Group's myriad products "grow affinity for the Virgin brand, which makes it much easier for Virgin Atlantic to acquire them as customers," Kreeger said. The Virgin aviation empire looks very different in 2017 than it did nearly a decade ago. In 2009, the brand was spreading to all corners of the planet. At one point you could fly Virgin-branded airlines east starting in Los Angeles, stopping in New York, London, Hong Kong and Sydney, and then go back across the Pacific. Today, Virgin America is entering its twilight years under new owner Alaska Air. Virgin Australia has consolidated a lot of its operations. A brief U.K. experiment with domestic routes didn't get traction and a Nigerian carrier has long since been shut down. "I wasn't brought in to worry about the other Virgin airlines," said Kreeger. "It is not our vision to conglomerate into a Virgin international airline." Virgin has been replacing its fleet with new twin-engine Boeing and Airbus airliners and is retiring the four-engined aircraft it once proudly trumpeted with the slogan "4 Engines 4 Long Haul." It has also shelved plans for flying the Airbus A380 superjumbo jet in favor of new smaller A350-1000 jets starting in 2019. Hand in hand with Delta, Virgin has focused on offering offering regular frequent flights across the Atlantic and connecting U.K. passengers deep into the U.S. airline's network. "We are a British focused airline. Our route network is created first and foremost around taking Brits to where we can make money carrying them," said Kreeger. He said Virgin Atlantic is now trying to get U.S. travelers to spend their more-valuable dollars in the U.K. "London has never been a better bargain for Americans to come visit," he says.

Advertisement After Donald Trump’s election, the flow of manufacturers setting up shop south of the border dwindled to a trickle. Caught in Trump’s Twitter crosshairs, Ford Motor Co. and Carrier Corp. scrapped plans to move jobs to Mexico in two very public examples of the slowdown. But now the pace is picking back up. Illinois Tool Works Inc. will close an auto-parts plant in Mazon, Illinois, this month and head to Ciudad Juarez.  Triumph Group Inc. is reducing the Spokane, Washington, workforce that makes fiber-composite parts for Boeing Co. aircraft and moving production to Zacatecas and Baja California. TE Connectivity Ltd. is shuttering a pressure-sensor plant in Pennsauken, New Jersey, in favor of a facility in Hermosillo. While Trump hasn’t stopped pounding his America First bully pulpit, and the future of NAFTA remains uncertain, “there’s cautious optimism and a hopeful attitude that cooler heads will prevail in Washington,” said Ross Baldwin, CEO of Tacna Services Inc., which facilitates relocations. Popular Now Managing the Financial Supply Chain Bike Production Shifts Gears and Rolls Back to the US Five Tips for Better Demand Planning and Forecasting Baldwin has seen the evidence: After business ground to a halt back in November, he’s now juggling two Mexico-bound clients. San Diego-based Tacna helps manage 4,500 workers in Mexico, where factory wages are about a fifth of those in the U.S. That may explain why Mexican manufacturing jobs rose 3.2% in January from a year ago as they dropped 0.3% in the U.S. The renewed exodus shows how difficult it will be for Trump to turn the macroeconomic tide just by jawboning alone. This week, he trumpeted a Ford investment in Michigan plants with a cap-lock fanfare: “JOBS! JOBS! JOBS!” The $1.2 billion will create or retain only 130 positions, though. (While Ford canceled plans in November for a new $1.6 billion facility in Mexico, winning Trump’s praise, it employs more than 7,000 workers in that country.) Trump’s plans to renegotiate NAFTA and talk of punitive tariffs can’t erase the need to manufacture in lower-cost countries, said Alan Russell, CEO of El Paso, Texas-based Tecma Group., which also helps open and operate factories in Mexico. European companies tap the Czech Republic for low wages and Asia has Vietnam, and the U.S. needs Mexico to remain competitive with labor-intensive products, he said. “This isn’t about taking jobs from the U.S. It’s about saving companies.” Russell helped Firstronic LLC open a factory in Juarez in 2014 to make circuit boards for customers including Audi and Tesla Inc. Workers, sporting maroon lab coats and wearing rubber straps on their shoes to ward off static electricity, make about $10 a day running computer-driven machines that insert capacitors and resistors onto green boards and solder them into place.  The Juarez expansion — and joint ventures in the Czech Republic and China — was a factor in Grand Rapids, Michigan-based Firstronic winning larger contracts from producers of auto parts and medical supplies, said CEO John Sammut. His sales are surging at a 30% annual clip. In Spokane, Triumph Group dismissed almost 80 production workers in January and plans to eliminate another 30 jobs by August as it moves work to Mexican plants, said Steve Warren, a local official of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers. “They are being pressured to supply parts as low cost as possible,” he said. For more manufacturing news, notes and analysis, check out the IW Daily Newsletter, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning Tapping cheap labor sometimes isn’t just about lowering costs, but accelerating growth. Large purchasers, including Kongsberg Automotive and Dura Automotive Systems, prefer to deal with a few global suppliers rather than a myriad of local companies. “If we were only producing in the U.S., we would lose out on the vast majority of the contract opportunities,” Sammut said. With the increase in business, Firstronic has added revenue and jobs in Grand Rapids, he said. Businesses haven’t dismissed a NAFTA renegotiation or policies being considered in Washington that might prove costly. A plan by House Republicans to implement a 20% border adjustment tax has raised concerns, especially among retailers such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc. that import many of their wares. The tax would be applied to sales of imported goods to reduce the U.S. trade deficit, which reached $734 billion in 2016. Trump repeated to a joint session of Congress last month his refrain that he will make it “much, much harder for companies to leave our country.” But his recent stumbles — travel bans blocked by courts and a health-care bill scuttled by his own party — underscore the limitations on presidential power and the difficulty he may have punishing companies or overhauling NAFTA. At a February conference in El Paso to discuss how Trump’s policies may affect trade, most in the room of plant managers, supply-chain officers and suppliers predicted NAFTA would likely be changed but not discarded, and that the changes might not be harmful. Whatever happens, Russell said his business fostering Mexican manufacturing will grow this year. The pressure to reduce costs is that relentless: “When you dissect the worst-case scenarios, it still makes sense to go forward with their business plans,” he said. “It’s a competitive world.” By Thomas Black Print reprints Favorite EMAIL Tweet Please Log In or Register to post comments.

Virgin Atlantic is only one part of the global Virgin brand, which touches everything from mobile phones to trains and hotels, gyms, banking and eventually space tourism. “Virgin Atlantic has carried the brand for quite some time,” said Craig Kreeger, Virgin Atlantic’s chief executive. Virgin Group’s myriad products “grow affinity for the Virgin brand, which makes it much easier for Virgin Atlantic to acquire them as customers,” Kreeger said. The Virgin aviation empire looks very different in 2017 than it did nearly a decade ago. In 2009, the brand was spreading to all corners of the planet. At one point you could fly Virgin-branded airlines east starting in Los Angeles, stopping in New York, London, Hong Kong and Sydney, and then go back across the Pacific. Today, Virgin America is entering its twilight years under new owner Alaska Air. Virgin Australia has consolidated a lot of its operations. A brief U.K. experiment with domestic routes didn’t get traction and a Nigerian carrier has long since been shut down. “I wasn’t brought in to worry about the other Virgin airlines,” said Kreeger. “It is not our vision to conglomerate into a Virgin international airline.” Virgin has been replacing its fleet with new twin-engine Boeing and Airbus airliners and is retiring the four-engined aircraft it once proudly trumpeted with the slogan “4 Engines 4 Long Haul.” It has also shelved plans for flying the Airbus A380 superjumbo jet in favor of new smaller A350-1000 jets starting in 2019. Hand in hand with Delta, Virgin has focused on offering offering regular frequent flights across the Atlantic and connecting U.K. passengers deep into the U.S. airline’s network. “We are a British focused airline. Our route network is created first and foremost around taking Brits to where we can make money carrying them,” said Kreeger. He said Virgin Atlantic is now trying to get U.S. travelers to spend their more-valuable dollars in the U.K. “London has never been a better bargain for Americans to come visit,” he says.

Pearlman, collectSPACE.com Editor | March 27, 2017 12:50pm ET MORE Video still showing the space station's Canadarm2 robotic arm (at bottom right) grappling Pressurized Mating Adapter-3 to relocate it from the Unity module to the Harmony module on Sunday, March 26, 2017. Credit: NASA TV via collectSPACE.com HOUSTON — A docking port that was previously used to connect space shuttle orbiters to the International Space Station was robotically relocated at the outpost on Sunday (March 26) to support the future arrival of commercial crew spacecraft. Flight controllers working at NASA Johnson Space Center in Houston remotely commanded the station's Canadarm2 robotic arm to grab hold of, move and reattach Pressurized Mating Adapter-3 (PMA-3) from the port, or left, side of the outpost's Tranquility module (Node 3) to the zenith (space-facing) side of the Harmony module (Node 2). "This reconfiguration that we are doing [will] get ourselves into position to support the commercial crew capability that we're hoping to bring on board late next year and in 2019," said Kenny Todd, NASA's operations integration manager for the station, in a briefing on Wednesday (March 22). NASA graphic showing from where Pressurized Mating Adapter-3 was being moved (in blue) to its new location (in green) at the International Space Station. Credit: NASA Boeing and SpaceX are developing new spacecraft — the CST-100 Starliner and Dragon, respectively — to launch astronauts to the space station, beginning as soon as late 2018. The commercially-operated vehicles will provide the launch services that the space shuttles previously provided and will augment the role that Russia's Soyuz spacecraft now solely provides. The Starliner and Dragon capsules will dock to the station at PMA-3 and PMA-2, another pressurized tunnel mounted to the forward-facing port on the Harmony module. PMA-2 was equipped with an International Docking Adapter (IDA) to be compatible with the new spacecraft in August 2016. "We'll be ready to install a docking adapter [on PMA-3] at the end of the year [or] first of next year time frame that will provide that second docking port that we're going to desire when we start seeing commercial crew coming to station," said Todd. To prepare for Sunday's move, Expedition 50 commander Shane Kimbrough worked outside the station to disconnect cables and electrical connections between PMA-3 and the Tranquility module during a six and a half hour spacewalk with European Space Agency astronaut Thomas Pesquet.  A second outing, scheduled for Thursday (March 30), will have Expedition 50 flight engineer Peggy Whitson connect heater lines to PMA-3. She and Kimbrough will also add protective micrometeoroid shields to the now open port on Tranquility and around the point where PMA-3 attached to Harmony. [Spacewalking Astronauts Prep Space Station to Dock with Commercial Spaceships] Sunday's relocation was the latest and final planned move of PMA-3 since it was brought to the space station aboard the space shuttle Discovery's STS-92 mission in October 2000. Initially installed on the nadir, or Earth-facing, port on the Unity module (Node 1), it was used by shuttles Endeavour and Atlantis to dock on missions that launched a segment of the station's truss in December 2000 (STS-97) and the U.S. Destiny Laboratory in February 2001 (STS-98). PMA-3 was then moved a month later during Discovery's STS-102 mission to the port side of Unity to make way for the delivery of pressurized cargo carriers. It stayed there until August 2007, when the Expedition 15 crew returned PMA-3 to Unity's nadir port in preparation or the arrival of Harmony on Discovery's STS-120 mission that October. PMA-3 was moved three more times prior to Sunday's final transfer. In August 2009, the Expedition 20 crew used the Canadarm2 to relocate the adapter from Unity's nadir to its port side to allow reconfigurations to the node's bulkhead. PMA-3 was then moved from Unity to the zenith port on Harmony in January 2010, prior to its relocation to the port side of Tranquility a month later during Endeavour's STS-130 mission that delivered Node 3 to the space station.

Photo: Reuters mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 10:58 PM, March 31, 2017 Updated: 6:03 AM, April 1, 2017 NORTH CHARLESTON, S.C. - Boeing Co's <BA.N> newest and largest Dreamliner model, the 787-10, successfully made its first flight on Friday, kicking off a test program for the high-tech jet. The plane, which sells for $312.8 million at list price and rounds out a family of three carbon-fiber composite Dreamliners, flew well, the pilots said. "We had a great flight," Captain Tim Berg said at a news conference after the flight. The plane "performed exactly like we thought it would." The flight was one of three initial voyages on Friday, joining the Airbus <AIR.PA> A319neo jetliner and the Antonov An-132D, a light turboprop military transport developed with Saudi Arabia. Boeing's 787-10 is being built at Boeing's factory in North Charleston, South Carolina, due to its large size. The facility is Boeing's only jetliner assembly factory outside of Washington state and, in contrast to the others, is not unionized. Last month, the new plane provided a dramatic backdrop for President Donald Trump's visit to the Boeing factory, where he promised to boost U.S. manufacturing and punish companies for moving jobs overseas. Companies in Japan, China, Italy, Sweden, France and Britain produce many of the 787's major components, such as wings, fuselage sections and the rudder. Airlines can choose engines from General Electric Co <GE.N> of the United States, or Britain's Rolls-Royce Holdings Plc <RR.L>. The first 787-10 took off at 9:38 a.m. EDT (1338 GMT) and landed at 2:35 pm EDT. The plane is a second and final "stretch," of the original 787-8, which debuted in 2011. It is 18 feet (5.5 meters) longer than the 787-9 and seats 330 passengers, 40 more than the 787-9 and 88 more than the 787-8. The 787 has been a top seller, with 1,200 firm orders as airlines use it to open new routes between smaller cities that can be profitable with the fuel-efficient 787. Airbus competes against the 787-10 with its A330neo, a remake of its older, aluminum-hulled A330 equipped with fuel-efficient engines. Both jets are optimized for shorter flights compared with other mid-sized, twin-aisle planes. After brisk initial sales, orders for both have slowed, with Airbus selling just over 220 of its A330neo. So far, the 787-10 has booked 149 orders from nine customers, about 12 percent of the total of firm orders. The mid-sized 787-9 has captured just over half the total. After spending 2017 in testing, the 787-10 is expected to enter service with airlines in 2018.

After generating revenue of US$2,43 billion in the 2016 financial year, which saw a 70% jump in net profit and an 18% increase in passenger numbers to 7,6 million, the airline says it is buying an additional 55 aircraft, expanding its fleet to 142 planes. Zimbabwe Independent's assistant editor Brezhnev Malaba (BM) interviewed the Ethiopian Airlines managing director (international services), Esayas Woldemariam (EW), in Victoria Falls at the launch of a direct flight from Addis Ababa. He also spoke about the revival of Air Zimbabwe. BM: You have been involved in discussions to explore the possibility of reviving Air Zimbabwe. Any progress on that front? EW: The talks still continue and we are very much focussed on helping in that initiative. BM: How do you envisage to structure this Air Zimbabwe deal if it were to materialise? We are talking of an airline saddled with debts exceeding US$300 million. EW: It all depends on the political will of the government of Zimbabwe, and on how they want to put it, whether it is going to be a joint-venture or management consultancy. Ethiopian Airlines is ready for all that. We have all the human resources, the material resources and the financial resources. We are looking forward to co-operating with Zimbabwe in a very big way so that we can be able to revamp the whole thing so that Zimbabwe and the rest of Africa are capable of combating the other airlines so that we can defend Africa's resources and defend the traffic of African airlines. BM: After studying Air Zimbabwe, what weaknesses have you identified in that struggling airline? EW: It is just focus which is lacking, otherwise I have been able to learn that Zimbabwe is the most literate African nation, the people in Zimbabwe are very intelligent. What needs to be done is to tweak that potential and direct it to the right channel so that we can channel it in the right direction. Instead of building 30 000 kilometres of railway from here to Cairo, we build just three to four kilometres of runway and connect people and goods and culture and services. It is cheaper to build and it's faster to connect. Right now Africa is transacting only 10% internally and 90% with the rest of the world; we want Africans to transact with each other so that employment creation and capital benefit this continent. BM: It must be a wonderful feeling to know that you are now flying to one of the top tourist destinations in Africa, Victoria Falls, one of the Seven Natural Wonders of the World. How do you feel? EW: It really feels great because Ethiopian Airlines has always been inspired by the continent and the airline is very African, right down to the bone marrow. Our commercial tagline is "The New Spirit of Africa" and it's our civic duty to our home continent to promote Africa's nature, culture, history and wildlife. That's why we succeeded in building the largest African network in the history of aviation. Ethiopian has been flying in the African skies since 1945. BM: That's a long time. What has changed since the old days? EW: At that time, Ethiopian Airlines was inspired to bring Africa together. At that time, our commercial motto was 'Bringing Africa Together". The only way to travel from one part of Africa to another was via Europe, but Ethiopian Airlines came to connect the continent and now we fulfil our civic duty to our home continent. We connect Africa more than any other airline, be it African, American or European. We fly in Africa to 56 destinations. We are operating 87 aircraft. BM: When are you getting these new planes? EW: The 55 aircraft have been ordered. Many of them are already getting phased into the fleet. In fact, last month we received additional Airbus A350s, so these will come successively in the next five to seven years. The 87 aircraft we are operating range from the largest Boeing 777-300, which is a 400 seater and the Dreamliner Boeing 787 and the Airbus A350, the most modern one and the Boeing 737-800, the Sky Interior with next-generation engines. Our network spans from Tokyo to Los Angeles and just about anywhere in between. The only inhabited continent we do not fly to currently is Australia, but in the next couple of years we are planning to go to Melbourne. BM: In recent years, we have seen an increase in budget airlines, particularly in Africa, small carriers that charge very low fares. Are they a threat to large airlines like yours? EW: We are not competing with them; we're co-operating with them. We want to see more budget airlines and more national carriers in Africa. The more the merrier. We want to keep the traffic from the Middle East big three (Emirates, Qatar and Etihad) and from the Europeans and from the others, to boast African airlines, because Africans have more to benefit from co-operating than from competing. If tourists from Zimbabwe come to Ethiopia and Ethiopian tourists come to Zimbabwe, job creation, hotels and other related businesses will thrive and capital will remain in Africa and not leave the continent. BM: You speak of the big three Middle Eastern airlines. How have you remained afloat in the face of such stiff competition? EW: Number one, we're African to the core, to the bone marrow. We know Africa better than anyone else. We know what the African customer wants by way of customer service, in-flight and on the ground. The others cannot compete, this is number one. Number two, what we do is that, with African people going everywhere, we try to conduct good market research on the primary and secondary destinations in Africa. We have a very good vision, a very good strategy about where to go and when to go. We have good corporate governance. All these factors combined enable us to beat the competition. BM: Ethiopian Airlines has been heavily involved in the establishment of a regional airline for West Africa, ASKY. How has that project gone? EW: We have been assisting to establish ASKY airline in Lome, Togo, for the West African sub-continent. And also Malawian Airline, in Malawi. BM: Why is it still extremely difficult to travel from one African country to another without having to fly via Europe first? EW: We are changing that. Within the continent, without having to go via Europe, you can now travel to many places. Ethiopian Airlines is committed to the building of an alliance of African aviation so that we can work with each other to serve the African continent.

Dave Majumdar March 31, 2017 TweetShareShare China is set to complete its first large-deck amphibious assault ship—the Type 075—by 2020. The vessel, which is currently under construction at the Hudong Zhonghua shipyards in Shanghai, is roughly the same size as one of the U.S. Navy’s Wasp-class (LHD-1) amphibious assault ships. “Construction of the Type 075 ships will take two more years,” a Chinese military source told the South China Morning Post. “The first vessel may be launched as early as 2019 and put into full service in 2020.” It is not clear how many Type 075 assault ships China intends to build, but the roughly 40,000-ton vessels will afford the People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) significant power projection capabilities. The vessels will be able to carry 30 helicopters onboard—six of which would be able to takeoff simultaneously from the flight deck. The massive 820-foot long—with a 98.4-foot beam—vessels will also feature a well-deck for launching ship-to-shore connectors and amphibious vehicles of various types. One feature the new Chinese vessels lack compared to their American counterparts is that the Type 075 does not have the ability to support fixed-wing air operations. China does not have a short takeoff/vertical landing aircraft similar to the Boeing AV-8B Harrier II or Lockheed Martin F-35B Joint Strike Fighter. However, there were unconfirmed reports in 2011 that China had started to development work on such an aircraft, as I have previously reported in Defense News. The Type 075-class vessels would complement China’s existing fleet of four Type 071 amphibious transport dock ships, which are similar in concept to the U.S. Navy’s San Antonio-class (LPD-17) vessels. The vessels can haul an entire battalion of PLAN marines, their equipment and ship-to-shore connectors—including air-cushioned landing craft, 20 armored vehicles and four helicopters. Two more Type 071s are currently under construction. Together, the Type 075 and Type 071 would provide China with a formidable power projection and amphibious assault capability–second only to the United States Navy. That means that China would have the means to intimidate its neighbors such as Taiwan—which Beijing views as a renegade province—the Philippines and others especially after China builds more aircraft carriers. But there are questions as to how operationally effective such vessels would be in such a threat environment. “China is not the only country with anti-access/area denial (A2/AD) capabilities and others can impose costs on its maritime forces that might make amphibious assault ships an expensive and risky proposition,” said Alex Alden, a defense analyst at the Center for Naval Analyses and senior fellow at the Center for the National Interest—the think tank that publishes this magazine. “Maybe they too should start thinking about distributed lethality.” Nonetheless, is Beijing is proceeding with building a carrier fleet. China’s second aircraft carrier—still based on the Soviet-era Kuznetsov design—is well into its construction phase. Meanwhile, China has started construction on the Type 002 aircraft carrier—which is an apparently an indigenous design that dispenses with skijumps. “My understanding based upon steam catapult testing is that the third carrier will be an attempt at a full CATOBAR design with steam catapults and hydraulic arresting gear that will allow China to launch aircraft with heavier bomb loads and go longer ranges,” Jerry Hendrix, director of defense studies at the Center for a New American Security told The National Interest. The vessel has been under construction at the Jiangnan Changxingdao shipyard in Shanghai since March 2015 according to the South China Morning Post.

Bell-Boeing is continuing its work to develop a roll-on/roll-off aerial refueling tanker capability for the company’s MV-22 Osprey tilt-rotor at the behest of the U.S. Marine Corps. If all goes well, the Marines should have an organic aerial refueling capability for their expeditionary strike groups operational by the 2019-2020 timeframe. The service wants the tanker capability for its fleet of Osprey so that the tilt-rotors would be able to extend the range of the Marines’ F-35B Joint Strike Fighters—which is becoming an increasingly important factor in the Pacific theatre. Dubbed, the VARS—V-22 Aerial Refueling System—the idea is for the Ospreys to top-off the F-35Bs as they takeoff from a large-deck amphibious assault ship with a full load of weapons but not fuel. The Ospreys would also be able to refuel the jets as they return—acting as a recovery tanker. I was an early critic of the Osprey, but it keeps proving its worth in new and unexpected ways.

For businesses, true genius lies in what they build upon these broad shoulders. Despite being arguably England’s greatest polymath, Sir Isaac Newton had a winning line in modesty. “If I have seen further,” he wrote to his friend and rival Robert Hooke, “it is by standing on the shoulders of Giants.” This great scientist’s humility provides an important lesson for businesses today: that it is foolish, if not impossible, to strive for success without taking advantage of the platforms provided by previous technological advances – even those achieved by rival companies. The Wright Brothers built their own engines, but they could not have made their first flight without the work of people such as Gottlieb Daimler and Karl Benz (among others). The first Industrial Revolution could never have happened without the pioneers of steam such as Thomas Newcomen and James Watt. And even today, Boeing and Airbus rely on Rolls-Royce and others to build their engines. The lesson is clear: to create something exciting and new, it usually makes more sense to build on an existing platform than it does to start from scratch. As with most things, the platform economy is nothing new. Today’s platform economy is powered by a huge, borderless ecosystem of megascale datacentres, artificial intelligence and crazy amounts of automation. These technologies enable the insight, the agility, adaptability, the user experiences and more that is required for business success today. They are at a scale and complexity beyond the capability of any but a few companies to develop themselves. Businesses must now prime themselves to become both providers and consumers on these emerging platforms. In many cases, this may require some counter-intuitive collaborations between rivals. One commonly cited example is Netflix, which hosts its streaming business on Amazon Web Services, even though its parent company has its own competing TV and film service. Another example is Salesforce using Microsoft Azure and integrating with Office 365 for collaboration, despite both competing in the SaaS CRM space. To become digital leaders in the future (and as Accenture points out, every business today is a digital business), as well as increase market share and tap into new growth opportunities, businesses must embrace the platform economy and work out how they can harness platforms and collaborate with partners, and even competitors, to deliver innovative new services. The technology standards that will power the platform economy of the future are being established right now, enshrined in services and digital marketplaces from the Apple App Store to Zylom. These ecosystems aren’t just making it easier for consumers to buy your goods: they are forcing businesses to change their operational and organisational models so that they can take advantage of this new co-operative framework. To do this effectively requires more than simply partnering with a technology provider. Businesses also need the agility and adaptability to take advantage of new platforms, and that often requires a transformation of the IT department. But beyond partnerships and outsourcing, success in the platform economy depends on having the right skills to take advantage of these new ways of working, such as familiarity with APIs and API management, artificial intelligence, automation, and other relevant technologies; and then having the mindset and organisational model to take advantage of them. We recently helped a utility company make this first step and create a platform that allowed their customers to consume and build on some of their data. We analysed an existing legacy system and found that over 90% of data being consumed was scraped from the website; this brittle way of consuming data and an unexpectedly large load (the data was more valuable than they expected) was causing issues for their customers and problems for the website’s availability. We rebuilt the system, providing an improved API on dynamically scalable and highly-available platform, which enabled their customers to build their own applications on top of the platform. The results were better than anyone expected. The system saw tenfold increase in volume – from 800,000 interactions per day (which was mostly webpages hits) to 8 million interactions per day, with not a second’s downtime during the whole period. This has encouraged the company to accelerate build-out of the platform and has led to their customers using the platform more strategically, strengthening their ties to the utility. This is a great example of how businesses can marry their internal skills and strategy with a platform partner to deliver a raft of new digital services that will define them in the decade to come. Let the technology giants forge ahead with their platforms. For businesses, true genius lies in what they build upon these broad shoulders.

Spaceflight Insider Search Search Home Archive Gallery Launch Calendar Mission Monitor The Hangar ⚠ Breaking: The game has changed! SES-10 mission redefines space flight EVA-41 spacewalkers outfit relocated docking module Derek Richardson March 31st, 2017 Astronauts Shane Kimbrough and Peggy Whitson work to remove the cover on PMA-3 during EVA-41 to prepare it for next year’s arrival of IDA-3. Photo Credit: NASA TV An astronaut duo stepped outside the International Space Station in the second spacewalk in less than a week. Expedition 50 Commander Shane Kimbrough and Flight Engineer Peggy Whitson ventured outside on a 7-hour long spacewalk to outfit a recently relocated docking module to ready it for commercial crew spacecraft sometime in 2018. During the March 30, 2017, spacewalk, the two astronauts worked to upgrade a computer relay box, connected power and data cables to Pressurized Mating Adapter (PMA) 3, and covered the Common Berthing Mechanism (CBM) port PMA-3 recently vacated. However, one of the four shields used to cover the CBM ended up floating away causing ground teams in Houston to come up with a makeshift plan to replace the cover. Extravehicular activity (EVA) 41 came four days after PMA-3 was relocated from the port-side CBM of the Tranquility module to the space-facing CBM of the Harmony module. A spacewalk before that, EVA-40 on March 24, had disconnected power and data cables to allow for ground-based robotics teams to move the docking adapter. PMA-3 after arriving in the Space Station Processing Facility before being integrated into the payload bay of Space Shuttle Discovery’s STS-92 mission in 2000. Photo Credit: NASA Pressurized mating adapters PMA-3 was a docking module used during the early days of space station construction. It allowed two Space Shuttle missions to dock below the fledgling outpost in order to attach the the P6 truss and Destiny laboratory in 2000 and 2001 respectively. After that, PMA-3 was no longer needed for construction. It remained attached to various CBMs over the course of station expansion to make way for newer modules. It was at its previous location for seven years. There are actually three PMAs at the station. PMA-1 connects the Unity module with the Russian Zarya functional cargo block module. PMA-2 was the primary docking module used for the Space Shuttle program during ISS construction and is located on Harmony’s forward CBM. Built by Boeing, all three are identical. They converted the 50-inch (127-centimeter) CBM hatches to the 31-inch (80-centimeter) Russian-designed APAS-95 docking hatch used by the Space Shuttles and Zarya. The small, 2,600-pound (1,200-kilogram) docking module is 6.2 feet (1.9 meters) wide at its widest and is 6.2 feet (1.9 meters) long. PMA-3 will be getting International Docking Adapter (IDA) 3 placed on it sometime in 2018 to convert it from APAS-95 to the new NASA Docking System that the two Commercial Crew Program spacecraft will be using. PMA-2 already got IDA-2 attached to it in mid-2016. The more modern system follows the International Docking System Standard, which uses low-impact technology and can be used for both docking and berthing, and autonomous or piloted dockings. EVA-41 EVA-41 began at 7:29 a.m. EDT (11:29 GMT) when the Quest airlock was depressurized and the two astronauts’ spacesuits switched to battery power. Once outside the airlock, the two went separate ways. Kimbrough, the lead spacewalker, translated hand-over-hand to the front of the S0 truss to work on installing an upgraded computer relay box. Meanwhile, Whitson moved all the way forward to the location of PMA-3. There she started to work to connect power and data cables stored there on previous spacewalks over the years in preparation for the docking module’s relocation. After that was completed, she started taking off the cover on the APAS-95 docking fixture, which has been attached to the front of the docking adapter since 2010. At S0, Kimbrough worked to replace a computer processor box called the External Control Zone 1 (EXT-1) Multiplexer-Demultiplexer (MDM). The task was essentially the same one he did during EVA-40 less than a week ago, but with a box on the zenith side of the truss instead. There was nothing wrong with the device, it was just being replaced with a more capable version. Unlike last week, however, this device put up a fight. Some of the bolts did not release properly and required extra work. Additionally, the new device in didn’t stay in its place when inserted and Kimbrough had to physically hold it while he used the pistol grip tool – a space-grade power drill – to tighten the central bolt. Once it was secure, the rest went by fast. He finished driving bolts and reconnected the Ethernet cable to integrate it back into ISS systems. After cleaning his area, he moved over to PMA-3 to help Whitson finish putting the docking module cover into a storage bag. The two together went back to the airlock to drop off the cover and other items not needed for the rest of EVA-41. They then grabbed new items to assist with attaching the CBM shields on Tranquility. Spacewalk support engineers work to come up with a solution to finish covering Tranquility’s port after one of its shields floated away. Photo Credit: NASA Shield lost Axial CBMs, like the one PMA-3 vacated, do not have retractable petals like those around the circumference of node modules. These petals are essentially shields to protect the berthing mechanics from debris and thermal variations. If a CBM is expected be vacant for an extended period of time, it needs shields attached. Unfortunately, one of these shields somehow became untethered while the two spacewalkers were preparing the work area. It could be seen floating away on camera. Mission Control in Houston determined the shield posed no threat of striking the station on subsequent orbits. It will eventually fall back into the atmosphere to burn up. However, that left the problem of one quarter of the CBM being exposed. Engineers in Houston worked to figure out how to cover it, at least temporarily. While Kimbrough and Whitson finished installing the other three shields as well as a cover for the porthole window, engineers on the ground devised a solution to use the cover from PMA-3 that was just stored inside the airlock. While the plan was being finalized the two astronauts translated back to the airlock to grab it and bring it over to the Tranquility work space. It was ultimately strapped down in such a way that it covered the shield hole to the satisfaction of engineers on the ground. The port-side CBM of Tranquility is expected to be unoccupied for at least a couple years before NanoRacks finishes its commercial CubeSat airlock. It will be launched aboard a future SpaceX Dragon capsule. Final tasks With that task finished, one more primary task needed to be completed: the attachment of three small shields around the base of PMA-3. Three of these cumberbunds, as they are called, were placed on the two sides of the PMA and one in the forward section. After completing that, the crew moved on to one get-ahead task. They translated to the bottom of Harmony to inspect the Earth-facing CBM. Robotic surveys showed a buildup of foreign object debris, known as FOD. They inspected it, took pictures for ground teams to inspect, and then attempted to scrap off some of the debris with a scraper with only partial success. Kimbrough and Whitson, nearing the seven-hour mark, then translated back to Quest to end EVA-41. A minor bit of drama struck when Whitson’s Helmet Camera Group, which houses cameras and lights, came loose. Kimbrough was able to secure it before it floated away to join the lost CBM shield. Finally back inside the airlock, and re-pressurization beginning, EVA-41 officially ended at 2:33 p.m. EDT (18:33 GMT). The total time spent in space by the duo was 7 hours, 4 minutes. New record This brought Kimbrough’s cumulative spacewalk time over six EVAs to a solid 39 hours. Whitson, having completed her eighth EVA, is at 53 hours, 22 minutes. She is now the most experienced female spacewalker, surpassing Sunita Williams record of 50 hours, 40 minutes. Whitson is scheduled for one more spacewalk before returning to Earth in June. That spacewalk, EVA-42, was originally scheduled for April 6. However, it requires a piece of equipment that is inside the Cygnus spacecraft awaiting launch. It was scheduled for a March 27 launch, but has since been delayed due to a hydraulic issue on the Atlas V rocket that will be flying it to orbit. When EVA-42 does occur, and it lasts at least 5 hours, 10 minutes, Whitson will be the third most experienced spacewalker, just behind retired astronaut Michael Lopez-Alegria’s 67 hours, 40 minutes. The world leader in spacewalking time is retired cosmonaut Anatoly Solovyev. He has 82 hours, 22 minutes over 16 EVAs in time spent in a spacesuit in the vacuum of space. EVA-41 was the 199th spacewalk in support of space station assembly and maintenance for a total of 1,243 hours, 42 minutes.

He is currently the managing editor of the student run newspaper, the Washburn Review. He also writes a blog, called Orbital Velocity, about the space station. His passion for space ignited when he watched space shuttle Discovery leap to space on Oct. 29, 1998. He saw his first in-person launch on July 8, 2011 when the space shuttle launched for the final time. Today, this fervor has accelerated toward orbit and shows no signs of slowing down. After dabbling in math and engineering courses in college, he soon realized that his true calling was communicating to others about space exploration and spreading that passion.

Ethiopian Airlines, Africa's largest cargo and passenger carrier, is dreaming big. After generating revenue of US$2,43 billion in the 2016 financial year, which saw a 70% jump in net profit and an 18% increase in passenger numbers to 7,6 million, the airline says it is buying an additional 55 aircraft, expanding its fleet to 142 planes. Zimbabwe Independent's assistant editor Brezhnev Malaba (BM) interviewed the Ethiopian Airlines managing director (international services), Esayas Woldemariam (EW), in Victoria Falls at the launch of a direct flight from Addis Ababa. He also spoke about the revival of Air Zimbabwe. Esayas Woldemariam chats to Transport minister Joram Gumbo in Victoria Falls at the launch of direct flights from Addis Ababa. Pics: Winstone Antonio. BM: You have been involved in discussions to explore the possibility of reviving Air Zimbabwe. Any progress on that front? EW: The talks still continue and we are very much focussed on helping in that initiative. BM: How do you envisage to structure this Air Zimbabwe deal if it were to materialise? We are talking of an airline saddled with debts exceeding US$300 million. EW: It all depends on the political will of the government of Zimbabwe, and on how they want to put it, whether it is going to be a joint-venture or management consultancy. Ethiopian Airlines is ready for all that. We have all the human resources, the material resources and the financial resources. We are looking forward to co-operating with Zimbabwe in a very big way so that we can be able to revamp the whole thing so that Zimbabwe and the rest of Africa are capable of combating the other airlines so that we can defend Africa's resources and defend the traffic of African airlines. BM: After studying Air Zimbabwe, what weaknesses have you identified in that struggling airline? EW: It is just focus which is lacking, otherwise I have been able to learn that Zimbabwe is the most literate African nation, the people in Zimbabwe are very intelligent. What needs to be done is to tweak that potential and direct it to the right channel so that we can channel it in the right direction. Instead of building 30 000 kilometres of railway from here to Cairo, we build just three to four kilometres of runway and connect people and goods and culture and services. It is cheaper to build and it's faster to connect. Right now Africa is transacting only 10% internally and 90% with the rest of the world; we want Africans to transact with each other so that employment creation and capital benefit this continent. BM: It must be a wonderful feeling to know that you are now flying to one of the top tourist destinations in Africa, Victoria Falls, one of the Seven Natural Wonders of the World. How do you feel? EW: It really feels great because Ethiopian Airlines has always been inspired by the continent and the airline is very African, right down to the bone marrow. Our commercial tagline is "The New Spirit of Africa" and it's our civic duty to our home continent to promote Africa's nature, culture, history and wildlife. That's why we succeeded in building the largest African network in the history of aviation. Ethiopian has been flying in the African skies since 1945. BM: That's a long time. What has changed since the old days? EW: At that time, Ethiopian Airlines was inspired to bring Africa together. At that time, our commercial motto was 'Bringing Africa Together". The only way to travel from one part of Africa to another was via Europe, but Ethiopian Airlines came to connect the continent and now we fulfil our civic duty to our home continent. We connect Africa more than any other airline, be it African, American or European. We fly in Africa to 56 destinations. We are operating 87 aircraft. BM: When are you getting these new planes? EW: The 55 aircraft have been ordered. Many of them are already getting phased into the fleet. In fact, last month we received additional Airbus A350s, so these will come successively in the next five to seven years. The 87 aircraft we are operating range from the largest Boeing 777-300, which is a 400 seater and the Dreamliner Boeing 787 and the Airbus A350, the most modern one and the Boeing 737-800, the Sky Interior with next-generation engines. Our network spans from Tokyo to Los Angeles and just about anywhere in between. The only inhabited continent we do not fly to currently is Australia, but in the next couple of years we are planning to go to Melbourne. BM: In recent years, we have seen an increase in budget airlines, particularly in Africa, small carriers that charge very low fares. Are they a threat to large airlines like yours? EW: We are not competing with them; we're co-operating with them. We want to see more budget airlines and more national carriers in Africa. The more the merrier. We want to keep the traffic from the Middle East big three (Emirates, Qatar and Etihad) and from the Europeans and from the others, to boast African airlines, because Africans have more to benefit from co-operating than from competing. If tourists from Zimbabwe come to Ethiopia and Ethiopian tourists come to Zimbabwe, job creation, hotels and other related businesses will thrive and capital will remain in Africa and not leave the continent. BM: You speak of the big three Middle Eastern airlines. How have you remained afloat in the face of such stiff competition? EW: Number one, we're African to the core, to the bone marrow. We know Africa better than anyone else. We know what the African customer wants by way of customer service, in-flight and on the ground. The others cannot compete, this is number one. Number two, what we do is that, with African people going everywhere, we try to conduct good market research on the primary and secondary destinations in Africa. We have a very good vision, a very good strategy about where to go and when to go. We have good corporate governance. All these factors combined enable us to beat the competition. BM: Ethiopian Airlines has been heavily involved in the establishment of a regional airline for West Africa, ASKY. How has that project gone? EW: We have been assisting to establish ASKY airline in Lome, Togo, for the West African sub-continent. And also Malawian Airline, in Malawi. BM: Why is it still extremely difficult to travel from one African country to another without having to fly via Europe first? EW: We are changing that. Within the continent, without having to go via Europe, you can now travel to many places. Ethiopian Airlines is committed to the building of an alliance of African aviation so that we can work with each other to serve the African continent.

All 65 of its Boeing Co. 777-300 family aircraft will have another seat in each economy-class row, shrinking space for fliers by about an inch, Asia’s biggest international carrier said in an emailed statement Friday. The change will result in a 3-4-3 configuration, in line with the industry standard adopted by many premium carriers, although legroom would remain the same, it said. The reconfigured planes, to be introduced between mid-2018 and 2020, “will in part help enable the airline to deliver on its goal of growing capacity by 4-5% per annum when the capacity of Hong Kong International Airport is constrained,” Cathay said in the statement. The marquee airline has embarked on its biggest corporate revamp in two decades, which involves job cuts and changes to mid- and senior-level management, after aggressive expansion by mainland Chinese carriers hurt the Hong Kong-based operator. Chairman John Slosar told reporters on March 15 that Cathay needs to become better, lower cost, more agile in terms of how it approaches the market. To make up for the smaller width, Cathay said it will offer “new ergonomically-designed” seats with thicker, customized cushioning, while its long-haul 777-300ER aircraft will have wider-screen, higher-resolution personal TVs. The South China Morning Post earlier reported on the planned changes to the aircraft. The legroom will remain at 32 inches, while the width of the seats will shrink by as much as 1.3 inches to 17.2 inches, Cathay said. Currently, the aircraft have a seat width of 18.2 inches and 18.5 inches respectively, according to industry data tracker SeatGuru.com. Cathay has 48 of the 777-300ER long-haul jets and 17 of the 777-300 regional planes. It reported a net loss of HK$575 million ($74 million) for 2016. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

It includes replicating the equations that govern how aircraft fly, how they react to applications of flight controls, the effects of other aircraft systems, and how the aircraft reacts to external factors such as air density, turbulence, wind shear, cloud, precipitation, etc. Flight simulators are widely used in pilot training, aircraft design, airborne equipment testing and other applications. The primary purpose of utilization of flight simulator is to train a pilot to achieve, test, and maintain proficiency in the operation of an airplane without risk to person or property and at a lower cost to training in the air.

Frohlich March 27, 2017 12:15 pm EDT Print Email Tweet U.S. government federal contract spending totaled $436.9 billion in 2015, with an estimated 64% of the spending going to national defense contracts. The U.S. defense budget is by far the largest in the world, and the government relies heavily on the private sector to meet its needs. Likewise, many contractors rely on the government for a substantial share of their revenue. To determine the companies profiting the most from the U.S. government, 24/7 Wall St. analyzed contract data from the Federal Procurement Data System. Companies were ranked on total payments received from U.S. government contract obligations in the 2015 government fiscal year. Former President Barack Obama signed the Budget Control Act into law in 2011, effectively reducing the defense budget by roughly $1 trillion over the 10-year period through 2021. Since 2011, annual defense spending has declined by 12.5%, likely also as a result of the reduced involvement in the Middle East. The budget cuts reduced the resources available for military contracts. Between the 2014 and 2015 fiscal years, annual contract spending fell by roughly $7.4 billion. Click here to see the 15 companies getting the most money from the U.S. government. Each of the five contractors receiving the most money from the federal government in fiscal 2015 — Lockheed Martin, Boeing, General Dynamics, Raytheon, and Northrop Grumman — were also in the top five each year since fiscal 2009. Also known as the big five, these companies have a longstanding relationship with the federal government and are unlikely to lose their status as top contractors in the near future. In an interview with 24/7 Wall St., Rob Levinson, senior defense analyst at Bloomberg Government, explained, “These companies have been doing business with the federal government for so long, they know very well how to navigate that whole process, which winds up being a comparative advantage.” The top five contractors received more than 20% of annual U.S. government contract payments in 2015. The U.S. military requires extremely expensive equipment, including nuclear submarines, aircraft carriers, and fighter jets. “There just aren’t that many companies that can do that,” and partially as a result, “[large contractors] have pretty consolidated positions,” Levinson said. Huntington Ingalls Industries, for example, is the only company capable of building the Navy’s nuclear-powered aircraft carriers, and one of two that builds the current fleet of DDG-51 Arleigh Burke-class destroyers. Major federal contractors are certainly not immune to shifting market and industry environments. For instance, in the wake of recent budget cuts, the government has lowered its quality standards for many IT products, favoring the least expensive bid proposals over more expensive, higher quality options. From the perspective of the U.S. government, these businesses have more flexible quality standards and are more easily replaced by smaller companies, in stark contrast to weapons and infrastructure operations. As a consequence, many contractors are shifting focus from their lower margin business segments. SAIC, for example, recently spun off its IT services segment into a separate company called Leidos. Lockheed Martin also spun off its IT business into a separate entity and merged it with the newly-formed Leidos. The federal contracting industry is complex, and current trends are not necessarily bound to continue. Throughout his campaign, President Donald Trump promised to boost the defense budget and build up the military. Taking into consideration Trump’s outspoken disapproval of current U.S. trade policy as well, the new administration may invoke substantial change in the contracting industry. To identify the companies gaining the most from the federal government, 24/7 Wall St. analyzed data compiled by the General Services Administration and accessed through the Federal Procurement Data System. Companies were ranked on total payments received from U.S. government contract obligations in the 2015 government fiscal year. Data on individual contracts also came from the Federal Procurement System. These are the 15 companies profiting the most from the federal government.

Whitson, 57, made her eighth career spacewalk, surpassing the record of seven previously held by American Sunita Williams. The spacewalk formally began at 7.29 am (4.59 pm IST) when Whitson and her NASA colleague Shane Kimbrough switched their spacesuits to battery power before venturing outside the airlock and into the vacuum of space. "Be safe and enjoy your time out," said French astronaut Thomas Pesquet as the hatch opened."I will be waiting for you." The goal of the six-and-a-half hour spacewalk is to continue upgrading the International Space Station for the arrival of commercial spaceships in the years to come. Thursday's walkabout is the second in a series of three spacewalks to outfit the exterior of the orbiting outpost with parking spots for a new generation of space taxis ferrying astronauts to the station. SpaceX and Boeing are currently designing crew vehicles that will begin flying people to the ISS as early as next year. Whitson's Space Cred Whitson earned a doctorate in biochemistry and served as the first female space station commander in 2008. She is a native of Iowa and is known for her quick wit, sense of humor and ease in communicating complicated science topics to a lay audience. Earlier this month, she said in an interview on NASA television that she has spent her time at the orbiting lab growing stem cells for a science experiment on cell therapies for cancer. She is also taking part in experiments to test how fire acts in microgravity to better understand how it spreads in space, and growing seedlings called Arabidopsis to study how plants grow in orbit.Now on her third long-duration spaceflight, Whitson is the oldest woman to ever fly in space. She arrived at the space station in November, after previously serving on two six month missions at the orbiting outpost in 2002 and 2008. On April 24, she will break another record -- this time for the most cumulative days in space by an American -- when she passes 534 in orbit, longer than current title holder Jeff Williams.Active on her Twitter account,  Whitson often writes about how research at the space station relates to every day life, and how she travels the world as part of her astronaut training. "I traveled to Russia eight times in the last 1.5 year training flow, two times to Japan and one time to Cologne," she wrote in a recent blog post. Next week, she and Pesquet, 39, will perform another spacewalk to continue the space station upgrades and maintenance needed for future spaceships.For part of the outing, Pesquet is scheduled to ride the robotic arm from part of the football field-sized lab to another."We call that officially the yee-haw ride," she told NASA television last week. Whitson is married to fellow NASA biochemist Clarence Sams.According to her NASA bio, her hobbies include weightlifting, biking, basketball and water skiing.

The latest is Flight Global which pointed out that the U.S. Navy is still struggling to find the root cause of the hypoxia issue plaguing the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet and E/A-18G Growler. That news is based on testimony this week from U.S. Navy leaders to the House Armed Services Committee. The service’s Boeing F/A-18s are experiencing a dangerous crew cabin pressure issue, while the newer variants may have possible oxygen contamination, Flight Global pointed out. The problems have been going on since 2010 and have yet to be solved, it added. But the Canadian military, which plans to purchase 18 Super Hornets as an interim fighter jet, doesn’t appear to be too concerned about the issue. The RCAF believes it can deal with the problem. “The oxygen requirements of the potential interim fleet would meet industry, regulatory, and operational standards,” the Canadian Forces noted in a statement to Defence Watch. “The Canadian legacy CF-18 uses a Liquid Oxygen system to supply the pilot, whereas the Super Hornet comes equipped with OBOGS (On-board oxygen generation systems.) RCAF Technical and Operational Airworthiness processes are in place to ensure that aircraft being considered for service are stringently assessed to ensure that an Acceptable Level of Safety exists to meet our training and operational demands.” No details were provided on how the RCAF will solve the problem that the U.S. military has been dealing with over the years (without success). Here is additional info from the Canadian Forces that was provided to Defence Watch: “RCAF has had no physiological incidents from 2010 to 2016 involving CF-18’s which would include oxygen loss, or decompression.  While these types of incidents are considered important safety issues and are not taken lightly, we do not currently have any identified trends of such events in the Royal Canadian Air Force. Training is in place for pilots to recognize the signs of physiological issues and to take the appropriate actions if required. The RCAF has a robust flight safety program which monitors safety issues for all of our fleets, and similar fleets in the Air Forces of other nations.”     Boeing Company F-18 Hornet sponsored Super Hornet Swarms of low-cost robots to dominate future wars, Pentagon official says Canada officially extends Iraq mission but only to June 30 Video Connect With Us Email Alerts Get the latest news in your mailbox as it happens Weather Weather Currently Feels Like We want you to have the most accurate weather report you can.

Print Story X Print Story World March 31, 2017 Share Advertisement US woman breaks record for most spacewalks American astronaut Peggy Whitson made history when she floated outside the International Space Station on Thursday, breaking the record for the most spacewalks by a woman. Whitson, 57, is making her eighth career spacewalk, surpassing the record of seven previously held by American Suni Williams. The spacewalk formally began at 7:29 am (1129 GMT) when Whitson and her Nasa colleague Shane Kimbrough switched their spacesuits to battery power before venturing outside the airlock and into the vacuum of space. "Be safe and enjoy your time out," said French astronaut Thomas Pesquet as the hatch opened. "I will be waiting for you." The goal of the six-and-a-half hour spacewalk is to continue upgrading the International Space Station for the arrival of commercial spaceships in the years to come. Thursday’s walkabout is the second in a series of three spacewalks to outfit the exterior of the orbiting outpost with parking spots for a new generation of space taxis ferrying astronauts to the station. SpaceX and Boeing are currently designing crew vehicles that will begin flying people to the ISS as early as next year. Whitson earned a doctorate in biochemistry and served as the first female space station commander in 2008. She is a native of Iowa and is known for her quick wit, sense of humor and ease in communicating complicated science topics to a lay audience. Earlier this month, she said in an interview on Nasa television that she has spent her time at the orbiting lab growing stem cells for a science experiment on cell therapies for cancer. She is also taking part in experiments to test how fire acts in microgravity to better understand how it spreads in space, and growing seedlings called Arabidopsis to study how plants grow in orbit. Now on her third long-duration spaceflight, Whitson is the oldest woman to ever fly in space. She arrived at the space station in November, after previously serving on two six month missions at the orbiting outpost in 2002 and 2008. On April 24, she will break another record -- this time for the most cumulative days in space by an American -- when she passes 534 in orbit, longer than current title holder Jeff Williams. Active on her Twitter account, @AstroPeggy, Whitson often writes about how research at the space station relates to every day life, and how she travels the world as part of her astronaut training. "I traveled to Russia eight times in the last 1.5 year training flow, two times to Japan and one time to Cologne," she wrote in a recent blog post. Next week, she and Pesquet, 39, will perform another spacewalk to continue the space station upgrades and maintenance needed for future spaceships. For part of the outing, Pesquet is scheduled to ride the robotic arm from part of the football field-sized lab to another. "We call that officially the yee-haw ride," she told Nasa television last week. Whitson is married to fellow NASA biochemist Clarence Sams. According to her NASA bio, her hobbies include weightlifting, biking, basketball and water skiing.

Wall Street Daily Home Innovation GeoMacro Special Situations Contributors Free Reports Archives About Us Home Innovation GeoMacro Special Situations Contributors Free Reports Archives About Us WSD Team Contact Us Archives Ensure Email Delivery Frequently Asked Questions Broker Listing Two Ways to Play the Highflying Drone Market Published Wed, Mar 29, 2017  |  Jonathan Rodriguez, Senior Analyst Imagine a world where soldiers can take out the bad guys without putting their own lives on the line. Or a world where farmers can plant their fields — without stepping foot outside… Or where catastrophic leaks from fuel storage tanks could be prevented long before it’s too late. Well, thanks to the work of aerial drones, all three of these scenarios — and many more — are possible right now. In fact, drone technology has become so widespread and affordable that regular folks like you and me can simply pick one up in a store. And on Monday, the Federal Aviation Administration announced that over 770,000 drone registrations have been filed in just the last 15 months. As senior analyst Jonathan Rodriguez details below, this market is exploding right now. And he’ll show you two ways to play the incredible upside… Ahead of the Tape, Louis Basenese Chief Investment Strategist, Wall Street Daily Profit From the Drone Invasion in Two Easy Steps Unmanned aerial vehicles, or drones, might be the most important tech device on the market since the smartphone. In fact, consulting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers estimates the global drone market will be worth $127 billion by 2020. Unfortunately, when many people think of drones, controversial images of war come to mind. That’s not surprising, since drones are used prominently in the defense industry. With good reason. Governments around the world have pushed in on them because they save the lives of countless soldiers around the world every day. But drone technology has made its way into many other fields, too. Drones are used in the entertainment industry for aerial filming… They’re also being used in the freight industry, delivering packages to remote locations inaccessible by car… Drones are even being used to plant farmers’ fields, shooting seeds right into the soil. Heck, PwC believes the UAV market in agriculture alone could fetch $32 billion. So how can you play the action? The biggest share of the drone market is held by giant defense companies like Lockheed Martin Corp. and Boeing. But the small-cap players in the space will offer the most compelling growth opportunities. Here’s how you can play the best of both worlds… Play #1: Going Small for the Biggest Gains AeroVironment Inc. (NASDAQ: AVAV) is a leading small-cap tech company that specializes in unmanned aerial vehicles. With a market cap of just $641 million, AeroVironment represents one of the drone market’s juiciest growth plays. The company manufactures drones for both military applications and agricultural support. Its agriculture drones can create 3-D maps of fields for farmers for efficient planting. And using infrared cameras, AVAV’s drones can help farmers identify sick crops quickly — so they can be treated or removed. The company booked $264 million in sales last year, and revenue has increased at a compound annual growth rate of 15% since 2004. In 2016, the company posted earnings growth of more than 205%. And on a forward basis, the company is expected to boost EPS by 141%. That’s nearly double the EPS growth rate of the aerospace industry (76.3%). Better still, the firm sits on $194 million in cash and carries zero debt. The company’s phenomenal bottom-line growth and lean balance sheet also make it a prime takeover target. Play #2: Trade a Mega-Cap Defense Stock at a Bite-Sized Price Northrop Grumman Corp. (NYSE: NOC) is one of America’s largest defense contractors. The company makes several combat drones, including the MQ-8C unmanned helicopter and the popular RQ-4 Global Hawk. Last year, Northrop Grumman was awarded a $108 million contract from the U.S. Navy to deliver 10 MQ-8C units by August 2019. This will bring the Navy’s total MQ-8C fleet up to 29. And the company snagged a $204 million contract with the U.S. Air Force to upgrade its existing fleet of Global Hawk drones. The company’s aerospace division, which includes UAVs, booked $10 billion in sales last year. The aerospace unit accounted for 44% of the firm’s total revenue of $25 billion. So Northrop Grumman’s exposure to the red-hot drone market is large. Instead of buying the shares outright, which run about $239, I’d recommend the January 2018 $260 call options, which are trading for just $7.20. This offers you leverage of about 33:1 to owning shares. The options break even if the underlying shares hit $267 by expiration, and the calls double in value if shares reach $273. Bottom line: With these two plays, you get the best of both worlds: a highflying small-cap drone company… along with low-risk, high-reward exposure to one of the world’s largest aerospace players.

On Thursday, March 30, 2017, Whitson set a record for the most spacewalks by a woman, eight, as she works on preparations for a new docking port on the ISS. (AP Photo/Dmitri Lovetsky, Pool) CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. – Spacewalking astronauts carried out an impromptu patch job outside the International Space Station on Thursday, after losing a vital piece of cloth shielding when it floated away. As the drama unfolded, Peggy Whitson set a record for the most spacewalks by a woman – eight – and the most accumulated time spent spacewalking – just over 53 hours. The bundled-up shield somehow came loose as Whitson and Shane Kimbrough worked to install micrometeorite protection over a spot left exposed when a new docking port was relocated. Mission Control monitored the shield as it drifted away and, a couple hours later, determined it posed no risk to the 250-mile-high outpost. It was visible in the distance as a white dot. Spacewalkers have lost things before, including an entire tool kit in 2008. The lost fabric shield is relatively large: It weighs 18 pounds and, unfolded, measures about 5 feet by 2 feet and is about 2 inches thick. It eventually will re-enter the atmosphere and burn up. The relocated docking port will serve as one of two parking spots for commercial crew capsules under development by SpaceX and Boeing. It was disconnected during a spacewalk last Friday by Kimbrough, the space station’s commander and a six-time spacewalker. Then flight controllers in Houston moved it to a new and better location Sunday. The spacewalkers hooked up heater cables to the port Thursday. Midway through the seven-hour excursion, Whitson surpassed the record for women of 50 hours and 40 minutes of total accumulated spacewalking time, held by former station resident Sunita Williams. Williams is one of four NASA astronauts who will make the initial test flights of the SpaceX Crew Dragon and Boeing Starliner capsules. The first flight could occur as early as next year. Whitson is now No. 5 on the all-time spacewalking list. A Russian holds the top spot: Anatoly Solovyev with 16 spacewalks for a grand total of 82 hours. The 57-year-old Whitson has been in orbit since November. This is her third space station stint. Altogether, she’s spent more than 500 days off the planet, also more than any other woman. She’s scheduled to return to Earth in June, but may stick around an extra three months, until September. NASA is hoping to take advantage of an extra seat in the Russian Soyuz spacecraft that’s due to launch with two astronauts next month and return in September.

He said that if Richard Branson, owner of Virgin Atlantic Airlines failed in Nigeria, then there is no reason to blame Nigerian Airlines for failing. Excerpts: WHY do you think domestic airlines fail in Nigeria? Thirty percent of the failures of the airlines is due to mismanagement of the owners and 70 percent is as a result of government and the harsh economic environment. I have been in the sector since 1973 and I have seen the airlines failing within a space of ten years they started operations. So, there is a common factor. The business of Nigeria Airways was government business. The problem of corporate governance has always been there. The Nigeria Airways was supposed to be repackaged and become a new carrier but the then president said the government is not buying into the repackaging. The second generation airlines such as Okada Air, Oriental Airlines, Triax, Kabo among others all meant well. Okada said they wanted to prove to the government that they could do the business and they brought a Boeing B747 but that aircraft never flew but was left to rot. Investment was wasted. Senator Hadi Sirika, Minister of state, Aviation Environment is very hostile for business He got a promise from then second in command during the Military regime, but we were looking at the airplane everyday as it parked at the airport. It was initially planned to do Lagos-London-Lagos routes. That was on the side of government and this was the same situation for Okada, Kabo Air. Recently three banks wanted to take over Etisalat due to the debts it owed the banks but the Nigerian Communication Commission and the Minister of Communication intervened and stopped the banks, but there was no indication that the Minister or the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA) made any step to save Arik or even Aero Contractors. Why is it so in the aviation industry? The Nigerian environment is very hostile for business and our civil servants in the Aviation Ministry (now Ministry of Transport) are supposed to see to the advancement of the sector, ensuring that airlines succeed. They are supposed to measure their progress from year to year. They should tell us the number of aircraft in the last one year, the number of airlines that have increased their fleet over the years, the growth rate amongst others. So, if there is no growth, there can be no development. Aviation Ministry, what are you set up to achieve? Where is aviation? How come Ethiopian Airline took us over? How come South Africa Airways took us over? What is that Ministry doing? The civil service is the government. The President will talk through the minister of aviation, who is responsible for the ministry, even if the Nigeria Civil Aviation Authority is autonomous. How has the foreign exchange policy affected the aviation sector? What I am trying to establish first and foremost is the mortality rate of our airlines. Why has it been ten years, after which they die? Belview was 14 years. 30 percent are caused by owners arbitrariness. Professional managers Success goes into their head so quickly and they ignore professional decisions and professional managers. In the government environment, there are a lot of factors. Foreign exchange is one that is highly volatile. It has always been like this in the last forty years. Early 1970s, I remember the exchange rate was four naira to a dollar. During the first coming of President Buhari, we faced the foreign exchange problem and the airlines were running with what was called blended rate. Various banks offered different exchange rates. Foreign airlines were faced with that. About five airlines left Nigeria. I was working for a Brazilian airline, Varig. I was deputy general manager. The airline left this country because of foreign exchange. They had naira in Nigeria, but they could not repatriate their revenue due to scarcity of foreign exchange. Iberia left, Varig, Scandinavian Airline amongst others left. Since then a big vacuum was created. During Buhari’s first coming, there was trade with Brazil; we had counter trade with Brazil. Volkswagen Nigeria was relating with Volkswagen Brazil. We had Sakamori, we had telecom from that country, pharmaceutical businesses from Brazil. There was huge economy exchange that time, but since the airline left there has been vacuum between Nigeria and Brazil in terms of business interaction. There was huge economic boost between those two continents then. Once aviation link is broken, economy is dead. We lost everything. As at 1994, exchange rate was around N22 per dollar. Nigerian airlines were selling one hour flight ticket for Lagos-Abuja or Lagos-Kano at N2,200 and at the exchange rate of N22, that amounted to $100. Lagos-Abuja was $100 value in 1994, which was about 23 years ago. Today exchange rate has moved from N22 to N450. Today, an airline sold ticket for N16, 000, which amounts to 30 dollars. Someone in government should raise an alarm over this. Do they want to kill the airlines? If I am in government, I will shut down the airline because this is showing you desperation for cash flow. And they call it promotion. What kind of promotion? Exchange rate will never make you earn the right tariff because people will not be able to buy the ticket. So, you decide to reduce the price, meanwhile your cost is increasing. The airlines in Nigeria currently are not charging the right tariff after 23 years. If people cannot fly, then do not kill them. If I am NCAA director general, I will shut any airline that charges less than $100. The recession, which peaked last year, adversely affected the business in Nigeria, but it seems to have affected the airlines more? The airlines borrowed a lot and their borrowing has dollar content and you do all your sales in naira, how can you get the foreign exchange content? You go to CBN, CBN says N305, which is not available. You spend so much on training, maintenance, so much for distribution. You have to pay dollars for virtually everything. The dollar is not available so, the operators have to go to the black market to get dollars at a higher rate than the rate he sold the ticket. How do you want that airline to service his debts? Because he has started, he cannot kill the business, so he keeps on struggling and he gets to a level that all the creditors gang up against him. The airlines AMCON has taken what success has it made of them? What is the objective of taking over? The job of the receiver manager is to assess your assets and liability and make up your mind on whether you will revive it or kill the company? Objective of taking over All over the world, when a business goes to receivership, he might decide to say since the company is bankrupt; they will keep the business running and make sure the business does not die. They can set all the debts aside and say when the business picks up, they can attend to other things. I do not think we have bankruptcy law in Nigeria and if that is the case, it behoves  our regulator to find a way to support our airlines having seen how and why they are dying, which is as a result of direct and indirect contribution. If Richard Branson came here and failed, what are the factors responsible? Richard Branson is doing well in Australia, in US and Europe, why did he fail in Nigeria? The Ministry of Aviation, NCAA and all stakeholders, if Richard Branson failed in Nigeria, then do not blame Nigerian airlines at all. When Branson was leaving, he said Nigerian politicians are carrier destroyers. They do not follow through an agreement, they cancel agreements. What is going to be the investor confidence?  The NCAA and the Ministry which are supposed to be government agents and decision makers should not have allowed AMCON to do what it did. They will ask AMCON their objective. An airline that went from 30 aircraft to nine and your eyes are wide open. Did the bad economy of the airline happen in one day? The aircraft would have been going for maintenance and not coming back. They are supposed to monitor the economic health of the airlines on a daily basis. The airline fill the forms and the NCAA has the right to make sure it is correct. When you are talking about capitalisation in this sector, it is not like the banks. Capitalisation is not liquidity. Our NCAA must be ready to see how liquid the airlines are. If they are not liquid, they must find out why and you must account for his problem of liquidity and where he can account for it, you realise that revenue is not covering cost; you have a job to do. Nigerians are watching to see the development in the new management of Arik Air. What is the hope that they will be able to revive the airline? Personally, I have no hope on AMCON because antecedent has not convinced me otherwise. The way they have been moving in the last three to four weeks, I see no hope. They took over Aero Contractors and I haven’t seen anything after that. They removed the CEO of Aero and sent him to the Nigerian Airspace Management Agency (NAMA), they brought in the chief pilot from Arik to Aero, all their postings have been haphazard, so I see no hope but I pray that they don’t kill the airline. The airline must not go under. It is not about paying off the banks but it is an in-depth understanding of the cause of the problem. If there are priority allocations of foreign exchange to some sectors, even religion, this is a very sensitive sector for FX allocation. Airline operator If the airline operator has borrowed with huge FX content, and FX has gotten to such an alarming rate, then there is a problem. For foreign airlines, they reduce frequencies, they are cutting their expenses, their bigger operational base are not in Nigeria. So, all they do is sell here and move their money. So, they know how to handle their problems. The Nigerian airlines’ home is here. Somebody needs sympathy for them and that sympathy should be from our own government, our NCAA and the Ministry. I see no reason why we cannot call the airlines together and find a way to make them strong. If I have my way, I will merge all of them into one without killing their individual identity. The total aircraft for Nigerian airlines today is less than thirty. South African airways has 53 aircraft, Ethiopian airline has close to 100. We can bring our airlines together and do a very robust schedule for all their airlines put together. As a roster the first airline for flight one, the next flight will be used as flight two. If the first airline does not go for any reason, the second airline can go, while the third airline can be used as flight three. The schedule will be maintained. So, you will be competing to do your flight because you are on the schedule and I will do 1000 flights using all the aircraft. I will use technology. If they can grow their fleet, they will continue to grow it to make it efficient. If you are going to position the aeroplane, we must have a standby. If you cannot position it in 30 minutes to take off, then the airline on standby will move in. The issue is policy. The NCAA just needs to ask for the airlines’ airworthy aircraft; we can have two strong competitors. This is to reduce competition and improve standard because NCAA will not take rubbish from any airline. That is what Imo Air is trying to do. Imo Air operated by Dana Air that is the concept. It is done all over the world. If you go to the United State that is what is done. American Airlines operated by different operators. American Airlines has robust schedule and it is not operated by American Airline aircraft but aircraft under the supervision of American Airline.

By Eric Mandel, Digital Content Producer   | March 30, 2017 @ 4:32 pm Comments Share Tweet Share Share (via Canva) Exactly five years ago, The Seattle Times ran an investigative series “Behind the Amazon.com smile” – a deep-dive into the soul of city burgeoning online retail monopoly. One specific aspect examined Amazon’s charitable giving and concluded that the Seattle-based company was a “virtual no-show in hometown philanthropic giving.” Related: Seattle shelter gets big boost from Amazon A half-decade later and there is still a prevailing thought that Amazon is tight with its money. But Jeff Bezos’ record-setting, $35-million donation to the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center indicates that notion may not be fair. Whether or not The Times’ series is responsible for showing Amazon the way to giving, though, is unknown. Amazon giving The Times story indicated that, despite 18 years of business and sprawling South Lake Union campus, the Fortune 500 company had an “astoundingly low profile in the civic life of its hometown,” especially when compared to the other local behemoths – Microsoft, Boeing, and Nordstrom. The story also scrutinized CEO Jeff Bezos, who didn’t comment for the story, specifically for Grinch-like tendencies, contrasting him with Microsoft CEO (and all-around Saint?) Bill Gates. However, as the Times reported in Thursday’s announcement, the Bezos family donated $500,000 to Fred Hutch in 2007, $10 million two years later and another $20 million in 2014. But Bezos and Amazon have been giving back to more than just cancer research. When contacted March 21 for a story about Amazon’s philanthropy and the impact of the Times’ 2012 series, an Amazon spokesperson responded with a link to a page that lists stories of the retailer’s philanthropy and another that explains some of the company’s initiatives. The company, according to its website, supports several local organizations and initiatives, including sponsorship of the Fourth of July fireworks on Lake Union and South Lake Union block party, hosting and mentoring Girls Who Code, endowing professorships in the University of Washington Computer Science Department, and more. Compare that to the previous 2012 Times story that said Amazon is not on the rosters of major donors to local nonprofits including Alliance for Education, Seattle Art Museum, and United Way; and had no record of donations for the Seattle Symphony, Washington’s Special Olympics, YMCA of Greater Seattle or Forterra, a prominent conservation group formerly called the Cascade Land Conservancy. While the list appears to be growing, so has the company itself. Could the company do more?

Whitson, 57, is making her eighth career spacewalk, surpassing the record of seven previously held by American Suni Williams. The spacewalk formally began at 7:29am when Whitson and her Nasa colleague Shane Kimbrough switched their spacesuits to battery power before venturing outside the airlock and into the vacuum of space. “Be safe and enjoy your time out,” said French astronaut Thomas Pesquet as the hatch opened. “I will be waiting for you.” The goal of the six-and-a-half hour spacewalk is to continue upgrading the International Space Station for the arrival of commercial spaceships in the years to come. Thursday’s walkabout is the second in a series of three spacewalks to outfit the exterior of the orbiting outpost with parking spots for a new generation of space taxis ferrying astronauts to the station. SpaceX and Boeing are currently designing crew vehicles that will begin flying people to the ISS as early as next year. Whitson’s space cred Whitson earned a doctorate in biochemistry and served as the first female space station commander in 2008. She is a native of Iowa and is known for her quick wit, sense of humor and ease in communicating complicated science topics to a lay audience. Earlier this month, she said in an interview on Nasa television that she has spent her time at the orbiting lab growing stem cells for a science experiment on cell therapies for cancer. She is also taking part in experiments to test how fire acts in microgravity to better understand how it spreads in space, and growing seedlings called Arabidopsis to study how plants grow in orbit. Now on her third long-duration spaceflight, Whitson is the oldest woman to ever fly in space. She arrived at the space station in November, after previously serving on two six month missions at the orbiting outpost in 2002 and 2008. On April 24, she will break another record — this time for the most cumulative days in space by an American — when she passes 534 in orbit, longer than current title holder Jeff Williams. Active on her Twitter account, @AstroPeggy, Whitson often writes about how research at the space station relates to every day life, and how she travels the world as part of her astronaut training. “I traveled to Russia eight times in the last 1.5 year training flow, two times to Japan and one time to Cologne,” she wrote in a recent blog post. Next week, she and Pesquet, 39, will perform another spacewalk to continue the space station upgrades and maintenance needed for future spaceships. For part of the outing, Pesquet is scheduled to ride the robotic arm from part of the football field-sized lab to another. “We call that officially the yee-haw ride,” she told Nasa television last week. Whitson is married to fellow Nasa biochemist Clarence Sams. According to her Nasa bio, her hobbies include weightlifting, biking, basketball and water skiing. — AFP-Relaxnews                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week The internet wants to ‘surrender’ to this pretty Malaysian policewoman Filling up on legumes could lower the risk of diabetes, says new study New research finds insomnia increases the risk of heart attack and stroke Japan counts down to cherry blossom fever Electromagnetic fields linked with nerve disease, shows study The internet wants to ‘surrender’ to this pretty Malaysian policewoman The jihadi who turned to Jesus Shop, sup, and style up at Merchant & Sisters, KL’s first modern general store Russian man rescues pregnant dog buried alive for two days (VIDEO) How two teens in leggings became a PR mess for United Airlines Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: ‘Babies’ on board for Beyonce and Jay Z Star-studded lineup in 'War Machine' Reuters Video: ‘The White Helmets’ filmmakers discuss ‘Muslim ban’ Reuters Video: ‘The White Helmets’ filmmakers discuss ‘Muslim ban’ Reuters Video: ‘Babies’ on board for Beyonce and Jay Z Reuters Video: Obama, Richard Branson go kiteboarding Related Articles Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2017 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | RecomN - Local Services

The best performing sectors Friday included real estate and utilities stocks. Financials and energy sectors lagged. WTI crude oil for May delivery settled at $50.60 a barrel, up 0.5% on the day, but closed the month down 5.8%. June gold added 0.3% on the day to settle at $1,251.20 and closed down 0.2% for the month. Equities were headed for a mixed close shortly before the bell as the DJIA traded down 0.09% for the day, the S&P 500 traded up 0.03%, and the Nasdaq Composite traded up 0.20%. The DJIA traded very near the break-even line just minutes before the closing bell. The closing tally could finish with either a small gain or a small loss for any or all of the indexes. The DJIA stock posting the largest daily percentage loss ahead of the close Friday was Exxon Mobil Corp. (NYSE: XOM) which traded down 1.74% at $82.24. The stock’s 52-week range is $80.31 to $95.55. Volume was about 20% above the daily average of around 12.8 million. The company had no specific news. E.I. du Pont de Nemours Inc. (NYSE: DD) traded down 1.16% at $80.69. The stock’s 52-week range is $61.12 to $82.37. Volume was less than 10% below the daily average of around 2.8 million shares. The company said this morning that it is extending the merger closing date for its deal with Dow Chemical and selling some of its crop protection assets to FMC. JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM) traded down 0.93% at $88.20. The stock’s 52-week range is $57.05 to $93.98. Volume was about 20% below the daily average of around 15.9 million shares.

Volume was about 65 below the daily average of around 3.4 million shares. The company on Friday completed the first test flight of its 787-10, but orders are few for the $313 million aircraft. Of the Dow 30 stocks, 12 are on track to close higher Friday and 18 are set to close lower.

Norquist March 31, 2017 TweetShareShare Substantive tax reform will pass in 2017. Its outlines are clear and the details are congealing. Keep in mind that the tax-reform package will be passed through the reconciliation process, which requires that changes not increase the deficit in years eleven to fifty. Anything goes in the first ten years, but if the total package is not deficit neutral by year eleven, the legislation expires. This allows the House and Senate to pass fundamental tax reform with only Republican votes. No Democrats’ votes are required—and none is expected. How did we get here? Donald Trump released his tax-reform proposal during the primary campaign a year ago; his most eye-catching goal was to drive the corporate income tax rate to 15 percent. Obama had flirted with 28 percent. House Republicans were proposing 25 percent. The House Republican Blueprint quickly moved their target to 20 percent. Trump had not initially included full and immediate business expensing (to replace long depreciation schedules) in his plan. Every other Republican presidential candidate and the House Republicans led with expensing, which dramatically reduces the cost of capital. Trump adopted full expensing. Trump’s plan reduced individual tax-rate reductions, and his plan merged with the House Republican individual reform, to move the present seven tax rates to three rates: 12, 25 and 33 percent. Capital-gains taxes will be set at 50 percent of the individual rates, for a top rate of 16.5 percent. Corporate capital gains will be reduced from today’s 35 percent to 20 percent. The emerging Trump/House plan abolishes the death tax and the Alternative Minimum Tax. The death tax was first imposed to finance the Civil War, and the AMT was imposed to solve a “fairness problem” that was supposed to hit 115 millionaires, and now hits millions of Americans. The United States will move from its present “worldwide” tax system—where Uncle Sam insists on the ability to tax American companies and individuals, regardless of where they work or are located. This puts American firms and American companies at a severe disadvantage. French firms and French citizens earning income in the United States pay U.S. taxes but not French taxes. Americans working abroad pay both French and American taxes (U.S. law allows limited deductibility of taxes paid abroad). The bill would allow the estimated $2.5 trillion of American earnings overseas to be returned, after paying an 8 percent tax on cash and 3 percent on fixed assets. After that, all earnings overseas could be returned tax free, forever into the future. American companies are happy to pay a one-time smaller hit and win permanent territoriality. It is the higher business tax and the worldwide tax system that makes an American company that operates worldwide worth more if it is bought by a Canadian or Belgian company. Corporate inversions are driven, not by wicked foreigners, but by destructive American tax law. The Trump/House plan ends that incentive to invert or move headquarters overseas. To “pay for” some of these tax reductions, business will lose the deductibility of net interest payments and many smaller deductions. The most controversial changes is making the corporate income tax “border adjustable,” so that when Boeing exports a plane worth $100 million it deducts $100 million from its reported income, and reduces its tax liability by $20 million in taxes ($100 million × 20 percent). An importer bringing in a $100 product must add the $100 to its taxable base and pay $20, or $100 × 20 percent. This does raise the cost of imports and reduces the after-tax cost of exports. Manufacturers in the United States like this a lot—importers less so. The border-adjustable feature raises $1 trillion over a decade. Without the border-adjustable feature in the corporate income tax, the tax writers would have to find another $1 trillion in higher taxes somewhere else in the code, reducing spending by $1 trillion in the next decade. The Senate rules insist that the budget changes be deficit neutral (not tax revenue neutral) over years eleven through fifty. If the tax and budget changes in tax reform do not keep the expected deficits from increasing from today’s expectations, then the tax package expires at the end of ten years. This is what happened to the Bush tax cuts of 2001 and 2003. Both Trump and the House very much want the legislation to be permanent. This is why the fight over repealing Obamacare was, and is, important. The American Health Care Act (AHCA) would have repealed $1 trillion of Obamacare taxes and $1.2 trillion in Obamacare spending over the next decade. It also would have expanded Health Savings Accounts and block-granted Medicaid to the states. In addition to being good health-care policy—moving decisions to consumers, and having competition, not price controls, keep down prices—it would have lowered the spending and tax projections of the future by $1 trillion a decade. This would have freed up a great deal of running room for tax reform. If Congress does not double back and revisit its failure to repeal Obamacare last week, it makes fundamental tax reform significantly more difficult. The tax reform would have to be smaller to fit inside the budget rules (a law, not a preference), since reconciliation bills or tax reforms would be temporary and turn into Cinderella’s pumpkin in ten years. The tax-reform package, like the Obamacare repeal, has been put together by House, Senate and White House leadership over the last year. Even governors have been brought into the sausage-making process—and this explains why both official Washington and the stock market have begun to see this reform as something as inevitable as anything can be in Washington.

It said the people were working as agents of North Korea's government in Russia, China, Vietnam and Cuba to provide financial support or help procure weapons for previously sanctioned companies. "Today's sanctions are aimed at disrupting the networks and methods that the Government of North Korea employs to fund its unlawful nuclear, ballistic missile, and proliferation programs," Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in a statement.

The ruling from US District Judge Gonzalo Curiel in San Diego concluded a lengthy and contentious lawsuit that played a prominent role in the presidential campaign last year.  The Trump University students, who paid as much as $35,000 for the seminars, claimed they were lured by false promises that they would learn Trump’s investing “secrets” from his“hand-picked” instructors. One Trump University student objected to the deal, in particular a provision blocking students from opting out of it. She said in court papers she would like to seek full recovery from Trump, plus punitive damages and other relief.

Ford Motor Co. and Carrier Corp., caught in Trump’s Twitter crosshairs, scrapped plans to move jobs to Mexico in two very public examples of the slowdown. But now the pace is picking back up. Illinois Tool Works Inc. will close an auto-parts plant in Mazon, Illinois, this month and head to Ciudad Juarez.

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    The heads of the House Armed Services oversight subcommittee wrote an open letter released Friday to President Donald Trump to appoint officials to vacant positions in the Pentagon. "We are writing to urge that you nominate a full slate of capable, independent individuals to fill the existing vacancies at Department of Defense's Offices of the Inspector General (DOD IG) and at the Office of Special Counsel (OSC)," wrote Reps. Vicky Hartzler, R-Mo., and Seth Moulton, D-Mass., the subcommittee chair and ranking member. The legislators add that the positions serve "a crucial function, conducting oversight and helping to ensure that the American people know about and have a means to address instances of waste, fraud and abuse in their government." They also argue that the positions act as a benefit to taxpayers, and that federal inspector generals saved $36.6 billion in the 2015 fiscal year. "We understand that you have recently withdrawn several nominees for these positions," Hartzler and Moulton wrote. "We strongly encourage you to expeditiously put forth new nominees and move them through the confirmation process so that these offices can fully exercise their statutory duty to be effective and independent watchdogs." Since appointing Defense Secretary James Mattis, Trump has yet to fill the remaining 52 empty DOD positions. Of his 11 nominees, two have removed themselves from consideration. Earlier this month, the White House announced a series of nominations for defense positions, including Boeing senior vice president Patrick Shanahan for deputy defense secretary, according to Bloomberg News. Trump previously touted Boeing as a solution to "the tremendous cost and cost overruns of the Lockheed Martin F-35," in a December tweet, despite earlier that month criticizing the company over the cost of a new Air Force One.

By AFP March 31, 2017 3:02 PM EDT Share on Facebook Tweet this article Email A space blanket floated away from American astronaut Peggy Whitson on Thursday as she made a historic spacewalk outside the International Space Station, setting a new record for the most spacewalks by a woman.   The crew was not in danger due to the mishap, which occurred when Whitson was trying to fold up a bulky cloth cover, known as an axial shield, and put it in a bag.   The incident briefly raised concern at mission control in Houston that the shield might come back and hit the orbiting laboratory.   About four hours into the spacewalk, however, NASA determined that the gear had drifted a safe distance away and there was "no recontact risk," said NASA commentator Gary Jordan.   Images on NASA television showed the shield as a small white dot in the darkness. A statement on NASA's website said the shield "was inadvertently lost" and "posed no immediate danger to the astronauts."   The space blanket was one of four covers designed to guard the station from micrometeoroids, and also for thermal protection.   To make up for the loss, Whitson and her colleague Shane Kimbrough retrofitted an existing cover outside the space station to serve in its place. The spacewalk formally began at 7:29 am (1129 GMT) when Whitson and Kimbrough switched their spacesuits to battery power before venturing outside the airlock and into the vacuum of space.   "Be safe and enjoy your time out," said French astronaut Thomas Pesquet as the hatch opened and Whitson made her way out in the dark, her path illuminated by a light on her helmet. "I will be waiting for you."   For Whitson, 57, the seven-hour, four-minute spacewalk was the eighth of her career, surpassing the record of seven previously held by US astronaut Sunita Williams.   During the walkabout, Whitson also beat Williams's time spent spacewalking. Williams's record was 50 hours 40 minutes. Whitson's total time is now 53 hours and 25 minutes.   "This is a significant milestone," said Jordan, as Whitson became the world's most experienced female spacewalker. "Congratulations to Peggy Whitson."   The goal of the spacewalk was to continue upgrading the International Space Station for the arrival of commercial spaceships in the years to come.   SpaceX and Boeing are currently designing crew vehicles that will begin flying people to the ISS as early as next year. RELATED: Stephen Hawking to Visit Space Aboard Virgin Galactic   Whitson earned a doctorate in biochemistry and served as the first female space station commander in 2008.   She is a native of Iowa and is known for her quick wit, sense of humor, and ease in communicating complicated science topics to a lay audience.   Earlier this month, she said in an interview on NASA television that she has spent her time at the orbiting lab growing stem cells for a science experiment on cell therapies for cancer.   She is also taking part in experiments to test how fire acts in microgravity to better understand how it spreads in space, and is growing seedlings called Arabidopsis to study how plants grow in orbit.   Now on her third long-duration spaceflight, Whitson is the oldest woman to ever fly in space.   She arrived at the space station in November, after previously serving on two six-month missions at the orbiting outpost in 2002 and 2008.   On April 24, she will break another record — this time for the most cumulative days in space by an American — when she passes 534 in orbit, longer than current title holder Jeff Williams. The @Space_Station is massive! We had to break it up into pieces to fit it in our huge pool! Read the story here: https://t.co/0nsooLrDBk pic.twitter.com/9HpJLD2JCP— Peggy Whitson (@AstroPeggy) March 29, 2017 Active on her Twitter account, @AstroPeggy, Whitson often writes about how research at the space station relates to everyday life, and how she travels the world as part of her astronaut training.   "I traveled to Russia eight times in the last 1.5 year training flow, two times to Japan and one time to Cologne," she wrote in a recent blog post.   Next week, she and Pesquet, 39, will perform another spacewalk to continue the space station upgrades and maintenance needed for future spaceships.   For part of the outing, Pesquet is scheduled to ride the robotic arm from part of the football field-sized lab to another.   "We call that officially the yee-haw ride," Whitson told NASA television last week.   Whitson is married to fellow NASA biochemist Clarence Sams.   According to her NASA bio, her hobbies include weightlifting, biking, basketball and water skiing.

Peggy Whitson, 57, has also broken the record for the most accumulated time spent spacewalking, previously previously held by Sunita Williams, of 50 hours and 40 minutes. Whitson and her spacewalking partner, Shane Kimbrough, ventured outside the International Space Station (ISS) on Thursday to complete prep work on a docking port. The pair were forced to carry out an impromptu patch job outside the International Space Station, after losing a vital piece of cloth shielding when it floated away.

Mission Control monitored the shield as it drifted away and, a couple hours later, determined it posed no risk to the 250-mile-high outpost. It was visible in the distance as a white dot.

The astronauts filled the gap using the cover that they had just removed from the relocated docking port. The cover is made of the same material as the shielding, according to Mission Control, and just as capable of protecting against potential strikes by bits of space debris and providing thermal control. (Photo: AFP) The relocated docking port will serve as one of two parking spots for commercial crew capsules under development by SpaceX and Boeing. Whitson has been in orbit since November 2016. This is her third space station stint. Altogether, she has spent more than 500 days off the planet - also more than any other woman.

Pexels This piece originally appeared on Quora: Why do most of the successful startups come out of the USA? I meet with startups from around the world. There are several reasons that more big tech startups come from here than from any other place. Access to role models. One CEO, as we drove by Apple’s headquarters, told me how he watched Apple growing up from a startup, like I did (I lived a mile or two away and got a tour when it was smaller than Y Combinator back in 1977). He said “if Apple can do it, anyone can.” More on why role models are so important later. Access to funding. Apple needed funding to get started. So does every startup. Only a few can go it on their own with just friends and family money. But here even friends and family money is easier to get because of the role models. We all know that if we give you $10,000 (what GoPro started up with, by the way, less than two hundred yards from my house) that it could become a billion-dollar company someday. How many people around the world know that’s possible? Not many, in my experiences. Access to business infrastructure. Need a lawyer that understands how to help startups? They are here. Need an office with good startup help? Go see something like Plug-n-Play that houses 300 startups. Need a PR firm? They are here. Need a mentor who has built a company before? They are here. Need a launch vehicle, like a conference? They are here. Need a CFO who understands how to get a company ready for an IPO? They are here. Etc., etc. Yeah, they might also exist elsewhere, but not in high concentrations like in San Francisco, Seattle, Boston, New York, Los Angeles. Access to distribution. How will you get your new service into the hands of people? How about app stores? Amazon, Apple, Google, Microsoft, and Facebook have them. Who else? No one with serious ones. How about search engines? How about partnership possibilities (want OpenTable to distribute your stuff, for instance?) Those distribution and partnership opportunities are probably in San Francisco or New York. Rarely other places. Not to mention that most of the world’s tech press is located in San Francisco or New York. Access to monetization capabilities. You want ads? New York has them. Who else will deliver you the USA market, which is still the richest in the world (at least for a few years until China totally takes over). There are other markets that can monetize, but they are not as profitable and harder to kick off a worldwide brand with. Access to Talent. The modern company will probably need a big data expert. Someone who knows how to push around a big Hadoop cluster, for instance. Do you have one in your local community? Probably not, but they exist like flies in the San Francisco area. Google, and many Silicon Valley tech companies (HP, Cisco, Sun, Yahoo) started at Stanford University, which continues to pour out a lot of top-rate engineering and business talent. Access to practiced management. Can you find a CEO that’s led a startup out of two-person eating-ramen mode yet in your local community? That understands how to handle HR problems because she’s done that before? Understands how to deal with the world’s top press? Understands how to get into Larry Page’s office and make a deal with Google? Access to production. Oakley, GM, Ford, Boeing and many others make their own products here, which makes it easy to find people who understand how to make things. Apple goes to China, but even there many Chinese manufacturing lines cater to American markets. Sheer serendipity. Often when I’m at dinner, drinking coffee in the San Francisco area I meet random executives from startups and big companies. This simply doesn’t happen in mass many other places in the world. I’ve witnessed these kinds of happenstance meetings turn into major business deals. Hard to put yourself in play elsewhere. The main thing, though, is the belief that it can be done. The company I work for, Rackspace, started up in San Antonio. Part of that was the simple belief, on our chairman’s part, that it could be done without moving to San Francisco. It certainly is easier to have that belief when you’re surrounded with other examples who have done it (San Antonio was also home to AT&T, for instance). Just the other day I heard two surfers talk about how GoPro started on the waves of Half Moon Bay and now is a billion-dollar business. Even surfers here know that they could become a billionaire, so they are more likely to start their own companies. It’s the belief that really gets things going here. That causes people to take risks (and be backed up by friends, family, and community). That rarely happens around the world. Robert Scoble is the entrepreneur in residence at Upload.

Jeff Wilkinson jwilkinson@thestate.com 1 of 6 i By Jeff Wilkinson jwilkinson@thestate.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story BAMBERG During World War II, Robert Hurst, Sr., whose family owned a manufacturing company in New York since 1907, was serving on the aircraft carrier USS Ticonderoga with a stocky man with a bullfrog voice from Bamberg named Franklin Rizer “Ziggy” Hartzog. The two became fast friends for the next two decades. When Hartzog, who owned Ziggy’s Restaurant and Motel in Bamberg, mulled a run for the state senate, Hurst promised to move the company to South Carolina to boost his friend’s political credentials. “Poppy would come down here to hunt and fish and Ziggy would visit New York to party,” Hurst’s grandson, Russell Hurst, said last week. “Ziggy wanted some Yankee business down here to help him run.” Hartzog won the seat, but died in a car accident in 1966. The next year, Hurst moved the plant to Bamberg to fulfill his promise. This year, Phoenix Specialty Manufacturing is celebrating its 50th year in Bamberg and 110th year in business. The company specializes in manufacturing custom-made, precision small parts – mostly for the aerospace industry. The fact the company, now run by Robert Hurst, Jr., has stayed in the family for 110 years is remarkable, S.C. Commerce Secretary Bobby Hitt said in a birthday celebration at the plant March 23. “There must be some kind of secret sauce,” said Hitt, whose grandfather used to run the Bamberg newspaper. In it’s early days, the company would stamp out washers and other small parts for buggies, boilers and railroads. “They did a lot of brass washers for a lot of industrial uses,” company president Pat Maloney said. “They made a lot of basic round parts with a hole in it.” The plant on Highway 301 makes 10,000 unique parts for 2,000 customers around the world, company officials say. Phoenix employs about 100 people and turns out 500,000 to 600,000 parts per day. The company’s products – specialty washers, seals, shims, gaskets and spacers – are deceptively simple-looking, and some are tiny. But they are made to exacting, custom standards out of an array of high-tech materials. Phoenix products can be found on the moon, on Mars, in Olympic bobsleds and NASCAR race cars. One woman even orders a specialtly washer as part of a magnetic scarf clasp. The company’s biggest customer is General Electric. If you travel via commercial airlines, the jet engine more than likely has parts manufactured by Phoenix Specialty. “The customers design the parts,” said Russell Hurst, the company’s vice present for sales. “They can be found on anything from a military jet to a White House Christmas ornament.” The company is now a critical component in South Carolina’s burgeoning aerospace manufacturing cluster, which supports more than 100,000 jobs and has a national economic impact of $19 billion. Boeing, which has a huge airline manufacturing plant in North Charleston, uses Phoenix parts through suppliers, Moloney said. In 1967, the original building was a 14,000-square-foot plant. Today, it has expanded to 120,000 square feet. At the birthday celebration, Hurst, Jr., said he spent the summer of 1967 helping hire employees for the new plant. Once it opened, “We learned quickly that South Carolina is a very friendly place to do business. “We prospered here because of the dedication and determination of our family, and because of the dedication and determination of our employees,” he said. Hurst himself has become a key leader in South Carolina’s success in manufacturing. At the celebration, Hitt praised Hurst for the role he plays as head of the board of the S.C. Manufacturing Extension Partnership, which under Hurst’s leadership has become “the model for the country.” Hitt said his former boss, Governor-turned-Ambassador Nikki Haley – who happens to be a Bamberg native – used to stress that, “Every job is a family.” Last week, Russell Hurst, the fourth generation of Hursts in line to take the reins of the company, said the average employee has worked there for 16 years. The company strives to be a workplace that retains the skilled workers it needs. “Manufacturing in South Carolina has a shortage of skilled workers,” Russell Hurst said. “So we have a clean workplace that’s air conditioned with very good benefits.” he said. “We hire for attitude. We can train an employee as we go along. We need people who are looking for a career.” Related content LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story Business Suggested for you Comments Videos facebook twitter email Share More Videos 0:59 VC Summer Nuclear Generating Station tour of the new reactors being built Pause 1:36 Tyasha Harris reacts after the win over Stanford 3:14 'It's incredible': Dawn Staley reacts after historic Gamecocks win 2:14 A'ja Wilson reacts after Gamecocks' win over Stanford 0:27 Angle two: Student breaks jaw, teeth after put in sleeper hold and thrown to ground in Five Points 0:56 South Carolina basketball practice in 60 seconds at the Final Four 1:23 Columbia police arrest suspect in 2011 murder of mother, daughter 1:01 Secret 'Bachelorette' filming spot for date 1 block from downtown Bluffton 1:48 Why Sen.

(QMCI: OTCQB) | QuoteMedia Announces Financial Results for 2016 Fiscal Year Mar 31, 2017 OTC Disclosure & News Service – PHOENIX, March 31, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — QuoteMedia, Inc. (OTCQB:QMCI), a leading provider of market data and cloud-based financial applications, announced financial results for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016. These results reflect a 2% increase in year-over-year revenue, from $8,658,667 in 2015 to $8,870,155 in 2016. “We are pleased with our progress this year.  We experienced four straight quarters of quarter-over-quarter growth throughout this year, and we are looking forward to a strong 2017,” says Robert J. Thompson, Chairman of the Board of QuoteMedia, Inc. “Consistent with our forecasts, stable growth – particularly pronounced in the final two quarters – led to a year-over-year increase in revenue as new product lines began to generate income.  We expect to maintain and build upon this momentum in the coming year.  “This year saw numerous deployments of QModTM, our proprietary HTML5 market data widgets, which feature almost unlimited customizability and variety. QMod is mobile-ready – automatically resizing and optimizing to the type of mobile phone, tablet or laptop on which they are viewed.  Unlike competitors’ products, the widgets are SEO friendly, as the content is available to be crawled and indexed by search engines. We are receiving considerable demand for these products and anticipate that this will be a major revenue growth area for QuoteMedia. “QuoteMedia also entered into several new agreements to deploy our Integrated Trading capabilities in 2016. Several installations of Integrated Trading were completed in 2016 and more are scheduled for completion in the coming months. Trade Integration allows QuoteMedia’s products to interact with our brokerage clients’ back-end trade execution and reporting platforms and enables synchronous trade execution and tracking of holdings.  “QuoteMedia substantially expanded its data coverage in 2016, particularly with respect to mutual funds, international exchanges, news and other content, and we will continue to do so for the foreseeable future. “Our plans for 2017 include increasing our focus on Quotestream deployments by brokerage firms to their retail clients, where we have several large projects already underway.  As well, we will be continuing our expansion into the investment professional market with Quotestream ProfessionalTM. “We are also focused on growing our Data Feed Services client base.  The expansion of our data coverage and feed products over the past year has enabled us to add several new clients, and we will continue to pursue these opportunities. “QuoteMedia will continue to focus on increasing the sales of its Interactive Content and Data Applications – particularly our QMod line of products.  There is strong demand for responsive, mobile-ready, SEO-friendly Web content across all levels of the financial industry. Notably, our QMod HTML5 market data tools and widgets are at the market’s technological forefront. “Additionally, the marketing of new deployments of our Trade Integration capabilities is underway and will continue to be a high priority in the coming year. “We intend to continue to sharpen our product and service strengths. Important new development projects for 2017 include broad expansion of data and news coverage, including the addition of a wide array of international exchange data and news feeds (including foreign language sources), expansion of fixed-income coverage, launching the HTML5 version of Quotestream, as well as a new Quotestream Mobile application, and the introduction of several new and upgraded market information products. “2016 was a successful year on many levels. We are determined to build on those successes and expect increased revenue growth in 2017.” About QuoteMedia QuoteMedia is a leading software developer and cloud-based syndicator of financial market information and streaming financial data solutions to media, corporations, online brokerages, and financial services companies.

Comparing the multinational super company's numbers to those reported by Debenhams James Moore Chief Business Commentator @JimMooreJourno Friday 31 March 2017 17:23 BST Click to follow The Independent Online Google paid £36.4m in UK corporation tax last year On a Friday afternoon, when no one’s paying all that much attention to business news, it emerges that tech and media superstar Google booked sales of £1.03bn in Britain last year, netting a profit of £149m and yielding tax of £36.4m for Britain’s battered exchequer.  Does that look low to you, given that this is a global giant, one of the world’s biggest and brightest companies? It does to me. It certainly does to the Liberal Democrat peer Baroness Kramer, who serves as the party’s Shadow Chancellor.  “It is appalling that Google are still getting away with paying such a paltry amount of their total revenue back in taxes,” she said, accusing the Government of “letting big online business off the hook”.  Read more Boris Johnson calls Google ‘disgusting’ for extremist content Google just launched a programme to teach black students to code Verizon, AT&T and Johnson & Johnson suspend advertising on Google But is she right? Am I right? Here’s what Google has to say on the subject: “As an international business, we pay the majority of our taxes in our home country, as well as all the taxes due in the UK. We have recently announced significant new investment in the UK, including new offices in Kings Cross for 7,000 staff.” Not that the latter is at all relevant to the discussion in hand. The investment is great. Thanks guys! But we’re talking taxes.  So, back to that subject, and the question of which of the three of us is right.  Just for fun I decided to look at a, shall we say, slightly less starry company. I picked from the second tier FTSE 250 index, because, as I said, Google's numbers look low to me, and so I thought it might be interesting to compare them to those reported by one of the stock exchange's second division.  I chose Debenhams, because it happened to catch my eye, and it’s a medium sized business that is relatively simple to understand.  For its last full trading year, to September 3, Debs reported UK revenues of £2.4bn, more than twice what Google reported. It made operating profits of £98m on those sales, and total pre tax profits for the group as a whole (it has a small international business) of £105.8m. On that, the company paid £21.6m, in tax.  That would suggest that Google is paying about what it should pay, a bit more, as a percentage of its profits, than Debs pays. Perhaps it needs a new accountant! And perhaps it shows that Baroness Kramer and me have got this badly wrong.  On the other hand, super duper, whizzy wonder company Google is reporting less than half the UK revenues that Debenhams reports. Debenhams! I know they’re in very different industries, but even so, I was left scratching my head over that one.  Of course, the difference between Debs and Google is that the latter is a multi national giant, with a bewildering array of businesses, operating companies and legal entities in a bewildering array of countries, all with wildly different tax rates.  As has become clear in recent years, big companies have a certain amount of choice when it comes to where they book revenues and where they book profits.

They will also boost the world economy by $19 trillion (£15.2 trillion). Investments in renewable power and energy efficiency will add about 0.8 per cent to global gross domestic product by 2050, the International Renewable Energy Agency, or Irena, said Monday in a report produced for the German government.

The theme park will be the first of its kind in the UK, and is being created by film company Paramount at a cost of £3.5 billion. Paramount 3/37 John Lewis cuts staff bonuses to lowest in 63 years despite soaring profits - Thursday March 9 John Lewis has cut its employee bonus to the lowest level in more than 60 years despite announcing surging profits. The partnership, which is owned by its employees, reduced the bonus to 6 per cent of salaries making it the lowest since 1954. It is the fourth year in a row that the payment has been cut. Pre-tax profits rose 21.2 per cent to £370.4m as overall sales rose 3.2 per cent but the group said it cut staff bonuses because of an “increasingly uncertain” market. Reuters 4/37 Philip Hammond downgrades UK economic growth for Brexit years - Wednesday March 8 The Chancellor was forced to slash his official economic growth forecasts while the Brexit talks take place, as he delivered his first Budget.

PA 5/37 UK businesses are already facing recruitment crisis as Polish workers head home - Friday February 15 After a Brexit vote in which a primary concern was too much immigration, some might be applauding the trend, but for important UK industries it is already creating a serious problem, and one that provides a preview of what may be to come for the wider economy. Reuters 6/37 Global sales of UK food and drink hit the £20bn mark for the first time - Tuesday February 21 Global sales of UK food and drink have hit the £20bn mark for the first time in history, as the Government prepares to ramp up its focus on international trade following the UK’s decision to leave the EU. Getty 7/37 Plastics industry 'pressured UK Government to cut recycling targets' - Friday February 17 Recycling targets in the UK were cut last year after successful lobbying from the plastics industry, a freedom of information request by Greenpeace has revealed. The Government came under fire last year after it announced that targets for plastic recycling would be reduced from 57 per cent to a mere 49 per cent for 2016 and then increased by 2 per cent each year to 2020, to a maximum of 57 per cent by 2020. AFP/Getty 8/37 Inflation hits 1.8% as post-Brexit pound weakness feeds through to high street - Tuesday February 14 UK consumer price inflation jumped to 1.8 per cent in the year to January, from a rise of 1.6 per cent in the year to December, as the slump in the pound since the Brexit referendum continued to trickle through to the high street. According to data from the Office for National Statistics published on Tuesday, January’s rise was the biggest since June 2014. But the jump narrowly missed analyst expectations for a 1.9 per cent increase, just below the Bank of England’s official 2 per cent target.

Getty 11/37 Brexit: Bank of England upgrades growth forecasts but still expects UK economy to be hit - Thursday Ferbruary 2 The Bank of England has dramatically upgraded its growth forecast for this year but stressed that households will still experience a major squeeze on incomes due to rising inflation. In its latest Inflation Report, the Bank upgraded its 2017 GDP growth forecast to 2 per cent, up from 1.4 per cent in November. The revision is certain to be seized upon by Brexiteers as evidence that the economy will not suffer from leaving the European Union and that previous economic warnings from the Bank have now been exposed as scaremongering. Yet the Bank’s forecasts continue to project a growth slowdown in 2018 and 2019, with GDP expected to expand by 1.6 per cent and 1.7 per cent in those years.

We crane our necks to spot the stout, bristly-whiskered sea lion, but all we see is the splash he makes as he swims away. Herschel, Devon says, is a bit of a legend in these parts. First spotted in the area around 1980, the crafty, rather gluttonous sea lion quickly learned he could nosh on all the tasty salmon he wanted if he hung around the complex’s fish ladder and trapped them against its cement walls. The salmon congregate at the ladder to rest for a few days before climbing it to spawn in the area’s freshwater lakes and rivers. Herschel was soon downing dozens of salmon per day. Then he got greedy, attacking other sea lions and even kayaks — yikes! — which he deemed a threat to his piscine bounty. Fisheries employees and other wildlife experts fought back against the flappered, 800-pound beast, shooting rubber-tipped arrows and metal pellets at him, and tossing underwater firecrackers into the sea. They also tried tempting Herschel away from the ladder by feeding him other fish — fish they had spiked with nausea-inducing lithium chloride — and even tried frightening him away with a mechanical orca whale, orcas being sea lions’ sole predator. But nothing fazed Herschel. Eventually they tranquilized him and trucked him far out into Puget Sound, but he swam back in a few days’ time. So they trapped him again and ferried him some 1,000 miles south to his home in Southern California. He returned 11 days later. Devon doesn’t say what happened to Herschel after that. But as some blamed him for a dramatic decrease in the watershed’s steelhead run, the rumor that he ended up at Sea World in Florida might be true. No matter his fate, his memory lives on at Ballard Locks, as any sea lion spotted near the fish ladder is now called Herschel. I crane to spot the ladder in case Herschel returns, but our kayak has drifted too far away. No matter; the large lock is now open, awaiting its new cargo. “Let the big boats in first,” Jay yells to our group, now excitedly clustering around the lock’s yawning mouth. We patiently wait a little longer as a sailboat glides in, followed by the Hop Aboard, a yacht from Yakima, Wash., and a water scooter. Then our group forms a conga line and streams into the lock, quickly snugging ourselves against its concrete wall like barnacles latching onto a boat hull. A knot of tourists forms on the viewing platform above and watches as the lock’s metal doors swing shut and water begins flowing into the chamber, quickly raising our assorted jumble of watercraft more than a dozen feet. When its 30-ton gates once again open, the various motorcraft sputter back to life and stream away, quickly fading to dots on the horizon. Our group quietly paddles to the end of the lock complex, then turns around and heads right back in for the ride back down to Puget Sound. Under the sea For 30 years, my husband, Ed, and I had talked about exploring Seattle. When we finally booked tickets to the city that birthed Boeing, Cinnabon, Starbucks and Zillow, the next step was planning what to see and do. Pulling up a city map on Google, we were struck by what is clearly the city’s major geographic asset: water. Sure, we knew Seattle was perched on the edge of the Pacific. But we hadn’t realized its western border and environs are a tangled mass of islands, inlets, bays, peninsulas and estuaries, gifting the city with 148 miles of freshwater shoreline and another 53 miles of saltwater shoreline. In a place so waterlogged, so characterized by the sea, the only way to truly understand it would be from the water. I quickly booked tickets for two kayak tours: one through the Ballard Locks, since they’re so famous, and a sunset tour from the North Admiral neighborhood, which promised awesome views of the city’s famous Space Needle-pierced skyline. Later that day, we again climbed into plastic kayaks and paddled into the rather sheltered waters of Elliott Bay, which sits south of Lake Union and Ballard Locks. Many famous city structures hug the bay’s belly: Pike Place Market, the Seattle Aquarium and Seattle’s Great Wheel, to name a few. Although the Space Needle, created for the 1962 Seattle World’s Fair, sits a half-mile away in the Seattle Center, an arts and entertainment venue, it’s easily visible, too. We followed our guide as she led us toward the skyline, which turned a bit rosier every minute as the sun glided toward the earth, and then to the south, where snow-capped Mount Rainier rose in the distance. The massive chunk of rock emanated strength, longevity and permanence, while the water dancing below us whispered of ephemerality. Back on land, we realized that these two dips into the area’s aquatic real estate simply made us thirsty for more. Pulling out a tourist booklet, we were faced with loads of options. We could hop on one of the ferries chugging along the shore; the most popular and scenic trips are over to Bremerton, a city on the Olympic Peninsula, and Bainbridge Island. A variety of sightseeing tours also were available, both on traditional seafaring vessels and “Ducks,” amphibious landing craft used by the Army during World War II. We could even book a voyage on one of the local high-speed catamarans and be whisked to Victoria, British Columbia, in two or three hours. Reverting to landlubbers Numbed by our choices, we changed course and decided to spend the rest of our time as landlubbers, admiring the water from terra firma. First up: a trip back to Ballard Locks, a complex that includes a museum and botanical garden in addition to the lock-viewing platform. Today no kayaks paddle into the locks; instead, the large lock fills up with a clutch of small white boats and the 104-foot-long M/V Puget, a debris recovery vessel operated by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The Puget patrols the inland waters of the Sound, plucking various items out of the water that might pose navigational problems for other boats. Today, her deck is loaded with logs and tree stumps. As the boats stream out of the lock into Lake Union, fish leap out of the water ahead of them as acrobatic escorts. We head downstairs to the fish ladder’s underwater viewing area. Sadly for us, we’re visiting in between salmon spawning seasons so all we see through the windows is murky water. Back on top, Ed points out a display, asking, “Have you heard of Herschel?” For the next two days we drink in the views of Seattle’s various bodies of water from every vantage point. We admire sparkling Elliott Bay from Victor Steinbrueck Park, a grassy patch of land just west of the city’s famed Pike Place Market. We peer down on pretty Lake Union from the Space Needle’s observation deck 500 feet up, then at eye level while traversing the trails at Gas Works Park, a nubbin of land at the lake’s northern end. Our final night in town we head to Kerry Park, a tiny plot in the city’s Queen Anne Hill neighborhood. The green space overlooks Elliott Bay and offers the quintessential view of the city skyline. In fact, most of Seattle’s promotional materials feature shots of the city taken from this very spot. We lean against the stone wall overlooking the bay and gaze into the inky night. The Space Needle is lit from head to toe, a regal, elegant presence commanding attention. Flowing behind it are innumerable city lights, clustered together in a gauzy blanket reminiscent of the Milky Way. Down in the bay, tiny lights wink merrily from various vessels. The view is simply breathtaking. We stand in silence for several minutes, and then Ed turns and looks at me. “We’re coming back,” he says. Just like Herschel.   Melanie Radzicki McManus’ book “Thousand-Miler,” about hiking Wisconsin’s Ice Age Trail, has recently been released. She lives near Madison, Wis.

But would that sort of cut have been imposed upon a male candidate with the same experience? James Moore Chief Business Commentator @JimMooreJourno Friday 31 March 2017 13:21 BST Click to follow The Independent Online GlaxoSmithKline: Pharma giant will pay new female boss 25 per cent less than her predecessor BEN STANSALL/AFP/Getty Images Pharma giant GlaxoSmithKline woke this morning to a new chief executive formally taking the reins, with the official retirement of Andrew Witty.  As has been much discussed, his successor could earn up to 25 per cent less than he did, and you might expect someone who regularly highlights the grotesque nature of CEO pay in this country to be pleased with that.  Yet, there is something ever so slightly discomforting about the fact that this seemingly sensible move is being imposed upon the company’s first female boss.  Read more GlaxoSmithKline's investment won't repair Brexit damage Glaxo boss quits before full-blown investor revolt over performance GlaxoSmithKline fined £37.6m for cheating NHS and taxpayer It’s not that Emma Walmsley is exactly going hungry. She will make a frankly absurd amount of money, with a starting salary of £1m, some 10 per cent less than Mr Witty’s basic, representing just one part of what is still a bloated package.  The total could reach £8.8m, by dint of the bonus schemes and sweeties companies hand to their CEOs on top of their basic pay. However, Mr Witty’s package was worth up to £11.6m.  So if she ticks all the boxes, or if the remuneration committee takes some of the boxes away (as too often happens), Ms Walmsley stands to make 25 per cent less than he could have.  The reasons for that look eminently justifiable. GSK’s big institutional investors have been voicing unhappiness about the largesse bestowed by the company on its executives, and they have every right to do that. They should do it more commonly and with more companies in which they invest on our behalf.  GSK has said it gave “careful and detailed consideration” to what they had to say. It also took note of the fact that this is Ms Walmsley's first stint as a group CEO. Nor does she have the pharma experience that Mr Witty had (she had previously been the boss of the consumer healthcare division, a role she was appointed to in 2010).  However, despite all that, a question has to be asked: Would the same reductions have been imposed had Ms Walmsley been Mr Walmsley and had the same experience (or lack of).  If you think I’m splitting hairs here, consider that the gender pay gap in Britain currently stands at 18 per cent according to official figures. However, the divide widens the higher up the salary scale that you go. Back in 2015, the TUC found that it stood at 55 per cent among the top 2 per cent of earners. Among the top 5 per cent it was 45 per cent.  Business picture of the day 37 show all Business picture of the day 1/37 Stopping climate change could boost the world economy by £15 trillion - Tuesday March 21 Efforts to slow climate change won’t just keep the planet habitable.

According to data from the Office for National Statistics published on Tuesday, January’s rise was the biggest since June 2014.

In its latest Inflation Report, the Bank upgraded its 2017 GDP growth forecast to 2 per cent, up from 1.4 per cent in November. The revision is certain to be seized upon by Brexiteers as evidence that the economy will not suffer from leaving the European Union and that previous economic warnings from the Bank have now been exposed as scaremongering. Yet the Bank’s forecasts continue to project a growth slowdown in 2018 and 2019, with GDP expected to expand by 1.6 per cent and 1.7 per cent in those years.

Reuters That is quite wrong. You shouldn’t receive less than the going rate for a job based on your gender (or based on your ethnicity, sexuality or any disability you might you have for that matter). It's a quesiton of fairness, and of justice.  It is for that reason that I raise the issue of Ms Walmsley’s package. The fact that she could earn £8.8m, if she hits on the usual nebulous set of targets, is ridiculous. But it is just as ridiculous that women at the top so commonly earn an awful lot less than their male colleagues for doing the same jobs.  I have no doubt GSK that would vehemently deny that Ms Walmsley’s gender played any part in its decision making. The company should actually be congratulated for joining the minority of FTSE 100 outfits with a female boss. But the message it could be sending about pay for women at the top, given the gap that exists between male and female earnings, is something we should think about all the same.  More about: Glaxosmithkline Executive pay Emma Walmsley Andrew Witty Reuse content Comments Most Popular Video Sponsored Features Follow us: User Policies Privacy Policy Cookie Policy Code of Conduct Complaint Form Contact Us Contributors All Topics Archive Newsletters Jobs Subscriptions Advertising Guide Syndication Evening Standard Novaya Gazeta Install our Apps We use cookies to enhance your visit to our site and to bring you advertisements that might interest you.

Freedom of movement restrictions mean the UK’s fourth-biggest industry faces a crisis, as plans to fill recruitment gap with British workers look set to fail James Moore Chief Business Commentator @JimMooreJourno Friday 31 March 2017 09:00 BST Click to follow The Independent Online Order mix-up: restaurants and other hospitality operators will need robots to step in at this rate Getty The problem with engaging with Brexiteers is their persistent refusal to engage with the reality of their choice. Another dose of the latter has come courtesy of the British Hospitality Association (BHA) which is alarmed at the prospect of tough new immigration controls.  One of the arguments against the EU was that its attachment to the free movement of people was preventing Brits from getting jobs. Read more Theresa May forced into embarrassing climbdown over security 'threat' EU tells UK: We will not punish you- Brexit is punishment enough Brexit bureaucracy will now take up all of our Government’s time The BHA’s analysis blows that one out of the water. It warns that if EU immigration is squeezed, hotels, bars and restaurants are going to face a huge problem getting the staff they need. A 60,000-heads-a-year-problem. Needless to say if Britain’s fourth biggest industry has a problem, we all do. That disturbing estimate of the industry’s yearly recruitment black hole is contained in a report commissioned by the BHA from accountants KPMG. It suggests that the industry will experience a greater hit from restrictions on EU migration than will any other.  Assume an outbreak of civilisation in Britain (hard, I know, with the Government we have) such that the rights of EU nationals living here are protected and that they can stay. Assume also that the recruitment of workers from the UK and the rest of the world remains constant.  That is when you face the 60,000 worker shortfall. It would be bigger still if ministers decide to be really silly – and given the way they’ve been carrying on...  It equates to a million workers in total, over a quarter of the sector’s total workforce, by 2029. No wonder the BHA is worried.  “Ah but,” say the Brexiteers, “you should just recruit more Brits” – at least those Brits not drafted into the fields to pick fruit for Environment Secretary  Angela Leadsom.  “Look, the figures from KPMG show London’s businesses in the sector employ between 25.7 and 38 per cent of EU nationals. They make our point for us.” Erm, well, no. For a start, the sector isn’t simply sitting back and moaning, or even remoaning, about its Brexit lot. It is working on plans to attract and train more UK workers. There might be some scope, says the BHA, to draft in more, older, staff – with the pensionable age rising, people will need jobs.  There might also be scope to reduce labour force requirements through automation. This is one industry in which the arrival of the robots we are told will automate one in three jobs, or something like that, mightn’t just be welcome but essential. Then there is the possibility of mining training programmes, and apprenticeships, for more workers still.  Perhaps the sector might think about how it could hire more workers with disabilities – that’s my idea and not one of KPMG’s. With the disability employment gap remaining persistently high, despite most disabled people wanting to work, there’s a potentially rich vein of workers to be tapped there. And, funny thing, they tend to be more loyal to their employers than are able-bodied employees. If you find an employer willing to make an adjustment to take account of your condition, you tend to be reluctant to take the risk of moving.  However, the report argues that even with all that, there will still be a shortfall. Those measures will only help plug part of it and with the flow of EU nationals over here decreasing (which shouldn’t surprise anyone given Brexiteer rhetoric) staff shortages are already starting to bite.  This is a stark reality that Brexiteer MPs who write to the BBC to complain about it not being positive enough would prefer to ignore; and why people like me find it so difficult to contemplate engaging with Brexit-backers.  Business picture of the day 37 show all Business picture of the day 1/37 Stopping climate change could boost the world economy by £15 trillion - Tuesday March 21 Efforts to slow climate change won’t just keep the planet habitable. They will also boost the world economy by $19 trillion (£15.2 trillion). Investments in renewable power and energy efficiency will add about 0.8 per cent to global gross domestic product by 2050, the International Renewable Energy Agency, or Irena, said Monday in a report produced for the German government.

The theme park will be the first of its kind in the UK, and is being created by film company Paramount at a cost of £3.5 billion.

The partnership, which is owned by its employees, reduced the bonus to 6 per cent of salaries making it the lowest since 1954. It is the fourth year in a row that the payment has been cut. Pre-tax profits rose 21.2 per cent to £370.4m as overall sales rose 3.2 per cent but the group said it cut staff bonuses because of an “increasingly uncertain” market.

Getty 7/37 Plastics industry 'pressured UK Government to cut recycling targets' - Friday February 17 Recycling targets in the UK were cut last year after successful lobbying from the plastics industry, a freedom of information request by Greenpeace has revealed. The Government came under fire last year after it announced that targets for plastic recycling would be reduced from 57 per cent to a mere 49 per cent for 2016 and then increased by 2 per cent each year to 2020, to a maximum of 57 per cent by 2020.

According to data from the Office for National Statistics published on Tuesday, January’s rise was the biggest since June 2014. But the jump narrowly missed analyst expectations for a 1.9 per cent increase, just below the Bank of England’s official 2 per cent target.

Tim Cook met Ms May at Downing Street on Thursday morning and reiterated the tech giant's plans to build a new UK headquarters at the Battersea Power Station as proof of the company's support of the UK. Getty 11/37 Brexit: Bank of England upgrades growth forecasts but still expects UK economy to be hit - Thursday Ferbruary 2 The Bank of England has dramatically upgraded its growth forecast for this year but stressed that households will still experience a major squeeze on incomes due to rising inflation. In its latest Inflation Report, the Bank upgraded its 2017 GDP growth forecast to 2 per cent, up from 1.4 per cent in November. The revision is certain to be seized upon by Brexiteers as evidence that the economy will not suffer from leaving the European Union and that previous economic warnings from the Bank have now been exposed as scaremongering. Yet the Bank’s forecasts continue to project a growth slowdown in 2018 and 2019, with GDP expected to expand by 1.6 per cent and 1.7 per cent in those years.

The crew was not in danger due to the mishap, which occurred when Whitson was trying to fold up a bulky cloth cover, known as an axial shield, and put it in a bag. The incident briefly raised concern at mission control in Houston that the shield might come back and hit the orbiting laboratory. About four hours into the spacewalk, however, NASA determined that the gear had drifted a safe distance away and there was "no recontact risk," said NASA commentator Gary Jordan. Images on NASA television showed the shield as a small white dot in the darkness. A statement on NASA's website said the shield "was inadvertently lost" and "posed no immediate danger to the astronauts." The space blanket was one of four covers designed to guard the station from micrometeoroids, and also for thermal protection. To make up for the loss, Whitson and her colleague Shane Kimbrough retrofitted an existing cover outside the space station to serve in its place. - Historic outing - The spacewalk formally began at 7:29 am (1129 GMT) when Whitson and Kimbrough switched their spacesuits to battery power before venturing outside the airlock and into the vacuum of space. "Be safe and enjoy your time out," said French astronaut Thomas Pesquet as the hatch opened and Whitson made her way out in the dark, her path illuminated by a light on her helmet. "I will be waiting for you." For Whitson, 57, the seven-hour, four-minute spacewalk was the eighth of her career, surpassing the record of seven previously held by US astronaut Sunita Williams. During the walkabout, Whitson also beat Williams's time spent spacewalking. Williams's record was 50 hours 40 minutes. Whitson's total time is now 53 hours and 25 minutes. "This is a significant milestone," said Jordan, as Whitson became the world's most experienced female spacewalker. "Congratulations to Peggy Whitson." The goal of the spacewalk was to continue upgrading the International Space Station for the arrival of commercial spaceships in the years to come. SpaceX and Boeing are currently designing crew vehicles that will begin flying people to the ISS as early as next year. - Space experience - Whitson earned a doctorate in biochemistry and served as the first female space station commander in 2008. She is a native of Iowa and is known for her quick wit, sense of humor and ease in communicating complicated science topics to a lay audience. Earlier this month, she said in an interview on NASA television that she has spent her time at the orbiting lab growing stem cells for a science experiment on cell therapies for cancer. She is also taking part in experiments to test how fire acts in microgravity to better understand how it spreads in space, and is growing seedlings called Arabidopsis to study how plants grow in orbit. Now on her third long-duration spaceflight, Whitson is the oldest woman to ever fly in space. She arrived at the space station in November, after previously serving on two six-month missions at the orbiting outpost in 2002 and 2008. On April 24, she will break another record -- this time for the most cumulative days in space by an American -- when she passes 534 in orbit, longer than current title holder Jeff Williams. Active on her Twitter account, @AstroPeggy, Whitson often writes about how research at the space station relates to everyday life, and how she travels the world as part of her astronaut training. "I traveled to Russia eight times in the last 1.5 year training flow, two times to Japan and one time to Cologne," she wrote in a recent blog post. Next week, she and Pesquet, 39, will perform another spacewalk to continue the space station upgrades and maintenance needed for future spaceships. For part of the outing, Pesquet is scheduled to ride the robotic arm from part of the football field-sized lab to another. "We call that officially the yee-haw ride," Whitson told NASA television last week. Whitson is married to fellow NASA biochemist Clarence Sams. According to her NASA bio, her hobbies include weightlifting, biking, basketball and water skiing.

Openreach, which is owned by BT, owns the telephone cables that connect the vast majority of businesses and homes to the national broadband and telephone network. In a statement on Friday, Ofcom said it wants to “provide incentives to invest in ultrafast networks, while promoting competition and protecting consumers from high prices”. Read more BT slapped with £42m Ofcom fine for regulatory breaches at Openreach As a result of that, it said it intended to cut the price that Openreach charges for some of its broadband packages, from the current level of £88.80 per year to £52.77 in 2020-2021. “We would expect much of this reduction to be passed through by retail providers to their customers, resulting in lower bills,” the regulator said. It added that regulating the price would help BT’s rivals to compete for customers. “Our proposals also provide an incentive for BT’s rivals to invest in their own ultrafast networks for the longer term.” Read more Will Ofcom compo plan force your broadband provider to shape up? 15 million UK homes pay £100 a year too much for broadband £440m government spend will bring broadband to 600,000 new homes Philip Hammond to invest £400m in 'full-fibre' broadband Hannah Maundrell, editor in chief of money saving advice site money.co.uk, described the move as “bold” and said she hoped it would enable households to have access to an “affordable, reliable, fast broadband connection and a choice of suppliers wherever they live”. CityFibre, one of the UK’s biggest providers of wholesale fibre network infrastructure, described the move as a “major step forward”. Ofcom also announced that it would be cracking down on Openreach to speed up services and repairs. It said that in future, Openreach will be required to complete 93 per cent of fault repairs within one to two working days of being notified – compared with 80 per cent at the moment – and complete 97 per cent of repairs within no more than six or seven working days. It also said it intends to ensure that Openreach provides an appointment for 90 per cent of new line installations within 10 working days of being notified, compared to 80 per cent within 12 days currently; and install 95 per cent of connections on the date agreed between Openreach and the telecoms provider, up from 90 per cent today.

In its latest Inflation Report, the Bank upgraded its 2017 GDP growth forecast to 2 per cent, up from 1.4 per cent in November. The revision is certain to be seized upon by Brexiteers as evidence that the economy will not suffer from leaving the European Union and that previous economic warnings from the Bank have now been exposed as scaremongering. Yet the Bank’s forecasts continue to project a growth slowdown in 2018 and 2019, with GDP expected to expand by 1.6 per cent and 1.7 per cent in those years.

Credit: Thomas Pesquet/ESA/NASA Shane Kimbrough and Peggy Whitson, setting a new record as the world’s most experienced female spacewalker, floated outside the International Space Station Thursday and continued work to set up a second docking port for U.S. crew ferry ships. They also installed an upgraded computer relay box and protective shielding before calling it a day. One of the shield segments being installed on a vacant port managed to escape its tether, floating away before the astronauts noticed. “Peggy, I don’t have a shield,” Kimbrough radioed, surprised. “What?” “Yeah, I don’t have a shield,” he repeated. “Where is it?” Whitson asked. “Ah, it is right by the radiator. It is moving station zenith, maybe half a foot a second and it’s going, looks like straight zenith from the radiator angle.” The micrometeoroid shield was one of four being installed on the Tranquility module’s outboard port. Flight controllers quickly determined it posed no threat of recontacting the station and after conferring on the ground, engineers suggested the astronauts make up for the lost panel by installing a thermal shield they had just removed from a docking port extension. They did that, and completed the rest of their objectives before returning to the station’s Quest airlock, repressurizing the compartment and ending the seven-hour four-minute spacewalk at 2:33 p.m. EDT (GMT-5) “Thank you guys, you did an amazing job, you had to deal with, obviously, the issue early on and came up with a great plan,” Kimbrough radioed flight controllers. “We really enjoyed working with you guys, it was an honor to be part of the team. Thanks to everybody.” “Shane, thank you for the words,” astronaut Anne McClain replied from mission control at the Johnson Space Center. “We certainly appreciate the work you both have done over the last couple of hours and your problem solving skills to get the mission accomplished.” Floating in the Quest airlock, Kimbrough and Whitson switched their spacesuits to battery power at 7:29 a.m. to officially kick off U.S. EVA-41, the second NASA spacewalk in one week. This was the 199th EVA in station history, the fourth so far this year, the sixth for Kimbrough and the eighth for Whitson. Four hours and 22 minutes into the excursion, Whitson, a veteran of two earlier long-duration station visits, set a new record for cumulative spacewalk time by a female astronaut, surpassing Sunita Williams’ mark of 50 hours and 40 minutes. When the spacewalk concluded, Whitson’s total EVA time stood at 53 hours and 22 minutes, moving her up to fifth on the list of most experienced spacewalkers. NASA is in the process of setting up a second docking port on the station to accommodate visits by commercial crew ferry ships being built by Boeing and SpaceX. One port already is in place on the front of the station’s forward Harmony module. Last week, during during a spacewalk by Kimbrough and European Space Agency astronaut Thomas Pesquet, cables connecting a docking port extension on the outboard port of the Tranquility module were disconnected. Over the weekend, flight controllers at the Johnson Space Center used the station’s robot arm to move the extension, known as pressurized mating adapter No. 3, or PMA-3, from Tranquility to the upper port of Harmony. A docking mechanism will be attached to the outboard end of the tunnel late this year or early next. During today’s spacewalk, Whitson hooked up heater cables and remove a thermal cover from PMA-3 while Kimbrough installed an upgraded computer relay box in the station’s power truss. Both spacewalkers then worked to install four protective shields over Tranquility’s outboard port where PMA-3 had been attached. It was during that work that Kimbrough noticed one of the folded panels had escaped. The spacewalkers then retrieved the thermal shield Whitson had removed from PMA-3 earlier and used cables and clamps to hold it in place over the Tranquility port, filling in the gap left by the lost panel. Once that work was done, the astronauts returned to PMA-3 and installed a different set of shields around the base of the extension where it connects with Harmony’s upper port. Whitson and Pesquet are officially scheduled to carry out another spacewalk April 6, but needed equipment is awaiting launch aboard an Orbital ATK Cygnus cargo ship that has been grounded by work to repair hydraulic lines in the freighter’s Atlas 5 rocket. In the meantime, Kimbrough, Soyuz MS-02 commander Sergey Ryzhikov and flight engineer Andrey Borisenko are scheduled to return to Earth on April 10, landing on the steppe of Kazakhstan to close out a 173-day mission. The next spacewalk is not expected until after two fresh crew members — Soyuz MS-04 commander Fyodor Yurchikhin and flight engineer Jack Fischer — arrive on April 20. But whenever the next spacewalk takes place, Whitson is expected to move up to No. 3 on the list of world’s most experienced spacewalkers with a total time of about 59 hours over nine EVAs. Only cosmonaut Anatoly Solovyev and former astronaut Mike Lopez-Alegria have more time outside, with 68 and 67 hours of EVA time respectively.

By: AP | Updated: March 31, 2017 12:53 pm Mission Control monitored the shield as it drifted away and, a couple hours later, determined it posed no risk to the 250-mile-high outpost. (Source: AP) Spacewalking astronauts carried out an impromptu patch job outside the International Space Station on Thursday, after losing a vital piece of cloth shielding when it floated away. As the drama unfolded, Peggy Whitson set a record for the most spacewalks by a woman, eight and the most accumulated time spent spacewalking, just over 53 hours. The bundled-up shield somehow came loose as Whitson and Shane Kimbrough worked to install micrometeorite protection over a spot left exposed when a new docking port was relocated. Mission Control monitored the shield as it drifted away and, a couple hours later, determined it posed no risk to the 250-mile-high outpost. It was visible in the distance as a white dot. As Whitson and Kimbrough installed the three remaining shields, Mission Control quickly came up with a TV MacGyver-like plan for a patch. The astronauts filled the gap using the cover that they had just removed from the relocated docking port. The cover is made of the same material as the shielding, according to Mission Control, and just as capable of protecting against potential strikes by bits of space debris and providing thermal control. The entire space station is protected, in some fashion, against possible debris strikes. it was not immediately clear how the shield got away, said NASA spokesman Dan Huot. It’s supposed to be tethered to the station or spacewalker at all times. Frustration was evident in Whitson’s voice as she told Mission Control about the mishap. She was delighted, though, by how well everything turned out. “You guys came up with a fantastic plan on short notice. That’s amazing,” Whitson radioed. Spacewalkers have lost things before, including an entire tool kit in 2008. But the getaway items are usually small, like bolts. The lost fabric shield is relatively large: It weighs 18 pounds and, when unfolded, measures about 5 feet by 2 feet and is about 2 inches thick. It eventually will re-enter the atmosphere and burn up. The lost fabric shield is relatively large: It weighs 18 pounds and, when unfolded, measures about 5 feet by 2 feet and is about 2 inches thick. (Source: AP) The relocated docking port will serve as one of two parking spots for commercial crew capsules under development by SpaceX and Boeing. It was disconnected during a spacewalk last Friday by Kimbrough, the space station’s commander and a six-time spacewalker. Then flight controllers in Houston moved it to a new and better location Sunday. The spacewalkers hooked up heater cables to the port Thursday. Midway through the seven-hour excursion, Whitson surpassed the record for women of 50 hours and 40 minutes of total accumulated spacewalking time, held by former station resident Sunita Williams. Williams is one of four NASA astronauts who will make the initial test flights of the SpaceX Crew Dragon and Boeing Starliner capsules. The first flight could occur as early as next year. Also Read: US astronaut breaks record for most spacewalks by a woman Whitson is now No. 5 on the all-time spacewalking list. A Russian holds the top spot: Anatoly Solovyev with 16 spacewalks for a grand total of 82 hours. The 57-year-old Whitson has been in orbit since November. This is her third space station stint. Altogether, she’s spent more than 500 days off the planet, also more than any other woman. She’s scheduled to return to Earth in June, but may stick around an extra three months, until September. NASA is hoping to take advantage of an extra seat in the Russian Soyuz spacecraft that’s due to launch with two astronauts next month and return in September. NASA, meanwhile, has indefinitely delayed a spacewalk that had been scheduled for next week. A shipment with replacement parts needed for that spacewalk is on hold because of rocket concerns at Cape Canaveral, Florida. Shipper Orbital ATK is relying on the United Launch Alliance’s Atlas V to haul up the goods.

Most Popular Getty STR/AFP By David Grossman Mar 30, 2017 Reusable rockets are one of the biggest potential boons to space exploration. If you could relaunch a rocket multiple times before discarding it, you could drastically cut down on the costs of spaceflight. So the China National Space Administration (CNSA) is developing a system to recover parts of rockets used in launches. Others have done this in various ways. NASA's Space Shuttle, flown from 1976 to 2011, was partially reusable. The first stage of SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket is reusable as well, with the company's first relaunch of a booster occurring today. However, the CNSA is taking a different approach than Elon Musk and the engineers at SpaceX. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below SpaceX's rockets land vertically on ground pads or barge-like drone ships in the middle of the ocean. The Falcon 9 slows itself down as it falls back to Earth by firing its main engines before touching down. Ultimately, SpaceX predicts that by reusing rockets, it can cut the cost of launching a Falcon 9 to customers by about 30 percent. However, the CNSA thinks there are cheaper and simpler ways to get the same results. Namely, parachutes and airbags. Most Popular In the CNSA's proposed system, parachutes would launch on the booster after it separates from the other stages of the rocket. A guidance system could be used to control movement, making sure the rocket component lands where it's supposed to. Then more parachutes would launch to slow it for landing and an airbag would deploy right before when it hits the ground. "The mainstream trend of modern rocket development is to increase the thrust and reduce the number of rocket engine. That is also why China, as well as Airbus, Boeing and Lockheed Martin did not use the technology," said researcher Deng Xinyu . These rockets, he told China Daily, would "determine the extent" of the country's space program. Airbags and parachutes provide problems of their own, of course. The expense SpaceX puts into its vertical landing system hypothetically gives it complete control over the booster's movement. "With a parachute you may hit a mountain top or end up in thick forest on a tropical island," professor Sun Yi, director of the aerospace science and mechanics department at the Harbin Institute of Technology, told the South China Morning Post. There's also the problem of designing an airbag to support the massive rocket booster. It keeps Xinyu busy. Describing his work schedule to China Daily, he sounds positively Musk-like. "I arrive in the office at 8 am every day and go home at about 8:30 pm. I also work at least one day over the weekend. Usually, I have only one supper with my family each week," he says. "But I don't regret choosing this job and I am still energetic. This is because my job keeps bringing me new challenges and inspiration." If his team is able to get a rocket booster to land on an airbag, there could be a whole new way to reuse launch vehicles.

Peggy Whitson, who became the world’s most experienced female spacewalker during the outing, told ground control teams that a bag containing the debris shield floated away at about 10am EDT/1400 GMT on Thursday. 'We've left junk everywhere': why space pollution could be humanity's next big problem Read more At the time, Whitson, 57, and station commander Shane Kimbrough, 49, were about midway through a planned 6.5-hour spacewalk to prepare a docking port for upcoming commercial space taxis and to tackle other maintenance tasks. It was the eighth spacewalk for Whitson, who surpassed the 50-hour, 40-minute record total cumulative spacewalk time by a female astronaut previously held by Nasa astronaut Sunita Williams. Cameras on the station tracked the debris shield bag as it sailed into the distance. Nasa said engineers determined it posed no safety threat to the astronauts or to the facility, a $100bn research laboratory that flies about 250 miles (402 km) above Earth. No other details were immediately available about how the shield, which weighs 8 kg, was lost. “Teams are focused on completing the (spacewalk) and will review the events as they unfolded after it is completed,” Nasa spokesman Dan Huot wrote in an email. Whitson and Kimbrough were working on a docking port that will eventually be used by space taxis being developed by Boeing and privately owned Space Exploration Technologies. The pair installed three other debris shields during their spacewalk and fitted a temporary cover over the docking port where the lost shield would have gone. While not a perfect fit, the cover will help protect the station from impacts and provide thermal shielding, Nasa said. Spacewalkers occasionally lose small items like nuts and screws, but rarely do large objects slip away. The last such occasion was in 2008 when an astronaut lost hold of her tool bag while struggling with a jammed solar panel. The lost debris shield will eventually be pulled back into Earth’s atmosphere and burn up. Until then, it joins more than 21,000 other pieces of orbiting trash and debris that are big enough to be tracked by radar and cameras on Earth.

Harrison Jr. | World War II veteran was member of the Tuskegee Airmen Dec. 14, 1920 -- March 22, 2017 April 1, 2017 12:00 AM Bonnie L. Cook / Philadelphia Inquirer John L. Harrison Jr., 96, of Philadelphia, a World War II veteran and Tuskegee Airman who went on to fly Air Force planes for more than two decades, died Wednesday of natural causes at Penn Hospice at Rittenhouse. Born in Kansas and reared in Omaha, Neb., Mr. Harrison had an early infatuation with airplanes. “Johnny Boy, you can do anything anyone else does, but you have to prepare yourself,” his parents told him. He graduated from Omaha University, and did further study at the University of Southern California and the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. After reading about the first class of African American pilots to train for combat during World War II, Mr. Harrison signed up in February 1943 to join Class 43-K, composed entirely of black recruits. He served with the Army Air Corps, the predecessor of the Air Force, until 1946. The fliers encountered discrimination “based on the color of our skin,” he said in a September 2009 oral history, but the harsh treatment by white officers only heightened the men’s sense of camaraderie. They painted the tails of their planes red, becoming the famed Red Tails, and distinguished themselves in combat by fending off enemy aircraft that threatened Allied bombers. “We were Americans, we were young, and we wanted to defend our country, just like everyone else,” he said in the history, recorded at a Tuskegee Airmen’s air show. Once Mr. Harrison completed basic training, he was promoted to second lieutenant, and advanced to specialized training on the B-25 Mitchell bomber and assigned to the 477th Medium Bombardment Group as a fighter pilot. He saw combat in Italy during World War II, and was among the Tuskegee Airmen who in 2007 were awarded the Medal of Honor by President George W. Bush and Congress. After the war, he loved flying so much he stayed in the Air Force. He was the first African American pilot and flight commander to regularly fly passengers and cargo across the Atlantic and Pacific oceans for the U.S. Military Air Transport Service. He crossed the Pacific 50 times, and the Atlantic 30 times, his resume indicates. In the early 1950s, Mr. Harrison was stationed in Hawaii, from which he flew to Japan, the Philippines, Wake Island, Hong Kong, and Saudi Arabia. In the mid-1950s, he flew to the Arctic, Greenland, and Iceland. He also piloted C-118 Liftmaster Transports to Scotland, Paris, Madrid, Cairo, and Saudi Arabia. In June 1963, Mr. Harrison retired from the Air Force with the rank of major. He was given the Air Force Longevity Service Award with four oak leaf clusters, according to his military record. Once back in Philadelphia, Mr. Harrison held various administrative posts, one as a deputy secretary of Pennsylvania under Gov. Dick Thornburgh, and another in the 1970s as a Girard Bank employee on loan to the National Alliance of Business. Before retiring later, he was a director of affirmative action for the Boeing Aircraft Co. in Ridley Park. For the last 50 years, Mr. Harrison made his home in Society Hill. He married Lula Mae Powell and had four children. They divorced, and she died in the late 1980s. He was married a second time to Genie Nascimento. She died, also in the late 1980s. He is survived by children Joan, John, Richard, and Darryl; nine grandchildren; and six great-grandchildren.

Print Story X Print Story World April 1, 2017 Share Advertisement Space blanket floats away during spacewalk MIAMI: A space blanket floated away from American astronaut Peggy Whitson on Thursday as she made a historic spacewalk outside the International Space Station, setting a new record for the most spacewalks by a woman. The crew was not in danger due to the mishap, which occurred when Whitson was trying to fold up a bulky cloth cover, known as an axial shield, and put it in a bag. The incident briefly raised concern at mission control in Houston that the shield might come back and hit the orbiting laboratory. About four hours into the spacewalk, however, Nasa determined that the gear had drifted a safe distance away and there was “no recontact risk,” said Nasa commentator Gary Jordan. Images on Nasa television showed the shield as a small white dot in the darkness. A statement on Nasa´s website said the shield “was inadvertently lost” and “posed no immediate danger to the astronauts”. The space blanket was one of four covers designed to guard the station from micrometeoroids, and also for thermal protection.  The spacewalk formally began at 7:29 am (1129 GMT) when Whitson and Kimbrough switched their spacesuits to battery power before venturing outside the airlock and into the vacuum of space. “Be safe and enjoy your time out,” said French astronaut Thomas Pesquet as the hatch opened and Whitson made her way out in the dark, her path illuminated by a light on her helmet. “I will be waiting for you.” For Whitson, 57, the seven-hour, four-minute spacewalk was the eighth of her career, surpassing the record of seven previously held by US astronaut Sunita Williams. During the walkabout, Whitson also beat Williams´s time spent spacewalking. Williams´s record was 50 hours 40 minutes. Whitson´s total time is now 53 hours and 25 minutes. “This is a significant milestone,” said Jordan, as Whitson became the world´s most experienced female spacewalker. “Congratulations to Peggy Whitson.” The goal of the spacewalk was to continue upgrading the International Space Station for the arrival of commercial spaceships in the years to come. SpaceX and Boeing are currently designing crew vehicles that will begin flying people to the ISS as early as next year. Whitson earned a doctorate in biochemistry and served as the first female space station commander in 2008. She is a native of Iowa and is known for her quick wit, sense of humor and ease in communicating complicated science topics to a lay audience.

The stand out performer in the space was none other than Goldman Sachs, which soared 32% from election night until the end of the year.  However, the momentum in the financial sector began slowing as it appeared Trump might not be able to get things done as quickly as he wanted. The S&P 500 Financial Index fell about 5% during March.   That weighed on Goldman Sachs, which is set to end the first quarter of 2017 in negative territory, down about 4%. The bank is the fifth-worst performing stock in the Dow. Meanwhile, rival JPMorgan fared a bit better, but was still among the worst performers in the Dow. Its stock eked out a gain of about 2%, which is about half of the Dow's gains during the quarter. Other laggards include Intel Corp, which has seen a -0.4%, and energy stocks such as Chevron and Exxon Mobil which lost about 9% apiece.  23 of the 30 companies companies listed on the Dow are in positive territory for the year. Apple led the pack, climbing about 24%, on its way to its best quarter in five years. Other firms in the top 10 include Boeing, Cisco, and Nike. The gained between 9% and 14%.

Photos Videos Topics Live SL 163/4 (31.1) - BAN (Yet to bat) Home India Mumbai Delhi World Business Technology Sports Entertainment Bollywood Hollywood Television Lifestyle Education & Careers TRENDING# Ravindra Gaikwad Yogi Adityanath Virat Kohli Donald Trump Narendra Modi Home World Poland expects to ink $7.6 billion deal for Patriot systems by end-2017 Shares1 Sat, 1 Apr 2017-12:25am , Reuters Poland expects to sign a deal worth up to $7.6 billion with U.S. firm Raytheon <RTN.N> to buy eight Patriot missile defence systems by the end of the year, Defence Minister Antoni Macierewicz said on Friday. Warsaw sees the deal as central to a thorough modernisation of its armed forces by 2023, in light of what Macierewicz called "growing aggression and a growing threat from the East." NATO member Poland has sped up efforts to overhaul its military following Russia's annexation of Ukraine's Crimea peninsula in 2014 and in response to Moscow's renewed military and political assertiveness in the region. "Those systems allow us to guarantee the security of the Polish state," Macierewicz told a news conference. The contract still requires approval from the U.S. Congress, as it involves a purchase of advanced military technology for which special permission must be obtained. "It's premature to say that it is all done," Bill Schmieder, Raytheon's head for Europe, told the same briefing. "But we have very high hopes that the process will proceed normally." The Patriot mobile missile defence interceptors are designed to detect, track and engage unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), cruise missiles and short-range or tactical ballistic missiles. Poland should receive the first of the Patriot systems within two years of signing the contract, Macierewicz said. All of the units would come with the Integrated Battle Command System (IBCS), designed to give commanders a better perspective of their operating environment to make better informed decisions. Starting with the delivery of the third system, the Patriots will also be equipped with 360-degree surveillance radars. Poland spends about 2 percent of its gross domestic product on defence, in line with NATO's target. But some military officials are pressing for more, saying nearly two-thirds of hardware dates from the era when the country was in the Moscow-led Warsaw Pact. Later on Friday, the Defence Ministry said it had also signed a $523.6 million agreement with Boeing to supply three 737-800 airliners for the use of senior Polish state officials. Two aircraft will be new and one used. The used aircraft will be delivered this year and the two new airplanes in 2020.

News Opinion Commentary Commentary: Plenty of good reasons to remain an Illinoisan Illinois Erin Hooley / Chicago Tribune Yes, there's a dark fiscal cloud hanging over Illinois, but the state has plenty of upbeat stories that are being ignored. Yes, there's a dark fiscal cloud hanging over Illinois, but the state has plenty of upbeat stories that are being ignored. (Erin Hooley / Chicago Tribune) John McCarron Please. Will the last Chicken Littles to leave Illinois remember to turn off your lights? After all, those of us planning to stay need our sleep. It's been hard to get the doctor-recommended eight hours of shut-eye with so many instant experts constantly squawking and shining their searchlights in the wrong places. We're talking here about the big whoop over Illinois losing population during the past three years with the biggest losses occurring in the Chicago region. The U.S. Census Bureau recently estimated Illinois lost 37,508 people in 2016 — more than any other state — with the Chicago metro area accounting for more than half that amount. Cook County alone "lost" 21,324 souls. So right away Gov. Bruce Rauner's office kicked into "I told you so" mode, as did the conservative pundits and think tanks behind the governor's push for so-called "reforms" that they say will boost our state's business climate. "People are leaving," said a spokeswoman for the governor, which is why the governor wants to "make changes that attract employers and create good jobs." "Illinois' dysfunctional government, weak job creation and ever-increasing tax burden help explain why," intoned an analysis by the tax-a-phobic Illinois Policy Institute. Reporters for our great city newspapers and TV stations, meanwhile, fanned out in search of disgruntled ex-Illinoisans or, better yet, families packing their bags. One young North Side couple told the Tribune they are moving with their newborn son to Denver, where on previous trips they discovered "how astonishingly clean and how fresh the air was and easy to breathe." All of which sounds fairly alarming until you consider some of the facts surrounding the facts. First, there's the distortion of big numbers. Illinois still has 12.8 million residents, so while losing 37,508 may sound like a lot — It's a smidgen less than entire population of Park Ridge! — it's less than one third of 1 percent. Then there's the fiction that masses are "leaving." Fact is, most of the decline has been due to fewer immigrants and lower birth rates. Or, as the Chicago Metropolitan Agency for Planning pointed out in its March bulletin: "CMAPs latest research on regional demographics attributes population decline largely to decreased immigration and declining births." Instead of interviewing disgruntled bag-packers and trunk-slammers, the press might have rung up Mexico City and asked folks there why the bloom is off El Norte. Hint: the Great Recession, the slow recovery and now, a president who doesn't appreciate the economic value of immigration. None of which is to say that Illinois doesn't have serious problems. Our tax burden isn't all that out of line with comparable states. Indeed, it's a bargain for retirees. But with nearly $12.5 billion in unpaid bills and an unfunded public pension liability approaching $130 billion, state income tax rates are almost sure to go up, and that exemption on retirement income may be peeled back. So there's a dark fiscal cloud hanging over Illinois and, yes, that may prompt some people to move elsewhere. More impactful, I'd guess, is that a lot of well-off retirees — baby boomers mostly — much prefer Florida beaches and year-round Arizona golf to another blustery winter of shoveling snow. Meanwhile, a more upbeat story is quietly unfolding among the young. Chicago is seeing an influx of digitally hip 20-somethings who know how to write software, analyze big data and market to their peers via social media. That's one reason major corporations from Boeing to McDonald's, from GE Healthcare to Google, are piling not just into downtown but warehouse warrens like Fulton Market. The digital future is bright for those prepared for it. Keep that in mind the next time some rich guy tells you we've got to freeze property taxes for schools, or de-politicize the drawing of electoral districts just in Illinois, or impose term limits on elected officials. It's all a crock. And by the way, young mom and dad, the air in Chicago is rated better than the air in Denver, which has a severe ozone problem. Enjoy your trip.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 31 March 2017 by Military News Innovation to Drive UAV Drones Market by 2024 In the overall commercial drone market, the major market is shared by the rotary blade type UAV drones because of its use in wide range of applications. Multi rotor UAV drones provide better flight control as it can have more than two or up to eight rotors and thus it can be used in aerial photography and surveillance. The UAV drones have been developing over the years with enhanced design, improved data-processing capabilities and significant operating ranges and tenure. Small UAV drones are being used prominently in several commercial applications. This market is experiencing a substantial growth during the forecast period because of changes in government policies and increase in the number of exceptions permitted to the companies for the commercial use of UAV drones. The demand for UAV drones is prominently contributed by various commercial sectors such as inspection, surveying, military and homeland security, media and entertainment, precision agriculture etc. Demand for commercial applications is gradually increasing but currently the demand is significantly higher in for military applications. In order to deliver the products to the customers in the minimal time span, various retailing and e-commerce companies have started using UAV drones. Moreover, one of the top e-commerce company suggested the allocation of separate airspace zone for the operation of the, UAV drones in order to deliver goods to the customers. However, implementation of such ideas are restrained by government regulations but are expected to become successful once allowed to be used into the market. Government of many countries are using these UAV drones in applications such as environmental studies, scientific research, infrastructure, law enforcement and in disaster management activities.

Multi rotor UAV drones provide better flight control as it can have more than two or up to eight rotors and thus it can be used in aerial photography and surveillance. The UAV drones have been developing over the years with enhanced design, improved data-processing capabilities and significant operating ranges and tenure. Small UAV drones are being used prominently in several commercial applications. This market is experiencing a substantial growth during the forecast period because of changes in government policies and increase in the number of exceptions permitted to the companies for the commercial use of UAV drones. The demand for UAV drones is prominently contributed by various commercial sectors such as inspection, surveying, military and homeland security, media and entertainment, precision agriculture etc. Demand for commercial applications is gradually increasing but currently the demand is significantly higher in for military applications. In order to deliver the products to the customers in the minimal time span, various retailing and e-commerce companies have started using UAV drones. Moreover, one of the top e-commerce company suggested the allocation of separate airspace zone for the operation of the, UAV drones in order to deliver goods to the customers. However, implementation of such ideas are restrained by government regulations but are expected to become successful once allowed to be used into the market. Government of many countries are using these UAV drones in applications such as environmental studies, scientific research, infrastructure, law enforcement and in disaster management activities. Because of the numerous benefits attained such as yield increase due to crop monitoring agriculture is expected to be the leading application over the forecast period.

However, both the total purchase purchase and the operational cost are kept secret. © AFP 2017/ SAUL LOEB Price Wars: Norway's Defense Minister Under Fire Over Costly F-35 Fighter JetsThe secrecy surrounding the acquisition of Norway's new surveillance aircraft is so strict that neither the public nor the Parliament is informed about the final price for the acquisition. Defense Minister Ine Eriksen Søreide said in a statement that the project's total cost amounted to "about 10 billion NOK" ($1.2 billion), assuring that the expenditure is covered by the long-term plan for the armed forces. According to Norwegian daily Klassekampen though, part of the expenditure is placed under the Intelligence Service budget. Despite the Norwegian government's pledges to increase the defense budget by 180 billion NOK (over $21 billion) over the next 20 years, individual acquisitions may still constitute classified information. In the case of the notorious Poseidon deal, information about the aircraft's sensors and equipment was considered highly sensitive and thus kept hidden both from parliament and the Norwegian public, despite the fact that the Finance Ministry specifically requests all public procurements exceeding 750 million NOK ($88 million) to undergo external quality assurance, which was clearly ignored this time. press-service of JSC "PO "Sevmas Norway Arms Itself to Deflect Difficult-to-Detect Russian SubsLeft Party leader and Parliamentary Defense Committee member Trine Skei Grande claimed far smaller procurements to undergo parliament's scrutiny. "We have papers here dealing with tens of millions, which are the size of a bible. Here, we have a billion investment which only is described in a few sentences," Trine Skei Grande told Klassekampen, venturing that Norway previously burnt its fingers on major defense investments with a poor foundation in parliament. The five P8 Poseidons will replace the fleet of six P3 Orions currently in service. The first planes are expected to land on Norwegian soil in 2022. The aircraft will be used for monitoring the waters off Norway's coast, particularly following the activity of Russian submarines. In the fall of 2016, the Orion generation of surveillanceaircraft was reported to be struggling with discovering the newest Russian submarines. Following a "submarine pursuit" in Vestfjord outside the city of Bodø, which was much less known than the Swedish 2014 submarine hunt, yet equally fruitless, a US P8 Poseidon surveillance aircraft landed for the first time at Andøya Air Station, which later proved to be a field power display. © AFP 2017/ LAURA bUCKMAN Norway Bets on F-35 to Attack Targets in RussiaMonitoring Russian activity has high priority for Norwegian surveillance aircraft and is also considered very important for NATO. Klassekampen's unrevealed sources claimed Norway to be under mounting US pressure to deliver good intelligence about Russian submarine activity. In case Norway fails to deliver, the US will come with its own aircraft to carry out the mission, the unrevealed source claimed, but was vehemently disclaimed by the Norwegian Armed Forces. The Boeing P8 Poseidon is a maritime surveillance aircraft developed for the United States Navy and is designed for anti-submarine warfare, anti-surface warfare and shipping interdiction. It is seen as a replacement for the Lockheed P-3 Orion and its multiple variants. Never miss a story again — sign up to our Telegram channel and we'll keep you up to speed! ...

Lange for The New York Times Air and fuel heaters at General Electric’s Gas Turbine Technology Lab in Greenville, S.C. G.E.’s chief has been outspoken about clean energy. Jeffrey R. Immelt, General Electric’s chief executive, says climate change is real, a position at odds with the Trump administration.

And environmentalists are counting on Mr. Immelt, and other executives close to the president, to use that access to argue for policies to combat global warming when the White House is rolling them back. Sign Up For the Morning Briefing Newsletter The companies’ business objectives and credibility are also at stake. Elon Musk of Tesla, another member of Mr. Trump’s council, is building an energy business intended to avoid the need for fossil fuels in favor of solar panels, batteries and electric vehicles. Doug McMillon of Walmart, the retail giant, has committed his company to a sharp reduction in the planet-warming gases it emits, as has Indra Nooyi of PepsiCo, the food and beverage company. BlackRock, the world’s largest publicly traded money manager — whose chief executive, Laurence D. Fink, sits on Mr. Trump’s council — has pledged to press companies to address the effects of climate change on their businesses. And Intel, Johnson & Johnson and Campbell Soup were among hundreds of businesses that urged the United States after Mr. Trump’s election to stick with last year’s Paris climate agreement and its commitment to reduce carbon emissions. “Mr. Trump says the business perspective is especially important, so hearing the business voice is critical,” said Kevin Moss, of the World Resources Institute, an environmental research group in Washington. “The companies are demonstrating that it’s in their business interest to take action on climate,” he said. “The more they’re willing to say that and take action, the stronger the message comes across.” Those hopes have become increasingly urgent as Mr. Trump — against the warnings of scientists, environmentalists and even the government’s own research — has moved to nullify the Obama administration’s efforts on climate change. On Tuesday, Mr. Trump directed the Environmental Protection Agency to start withdrawing and rewriting Mr. Obama’s Clean Power Plan, which would have closed hundreds of coal-fired power plants. In a joint statement after the order, a group of technology companies, including Apple, Amazon, Google and Microsoft, urged Mr. Trump to stay the course. “Strong clean energy and climate policies, like the Clean Power Plan, can make renewable energy supplies more robust and address the serious threat of climate change,” they said. That action also spurred Mr. Immelt to write a blog post to G.E.’s 300,000 employees in which he criticized the rollback. “We believe climate change is real and the science is well accepted,” said the post, first reported by Politico. “This is just the beginning of what will be a long process” of a repeal, he said, but “no matter how it unfolds, it doesn’t change what G.E. believes.” Jennifer Friedman, a General Electric spokeswoman, declined to say whether Mr. Immelt intended to relay his thoughts to Mr. Trump personally. Many other companies also declined to commit their executives to intervening with the president on climate-related policies. But Ms. Friedman emphasized that Mr. Immelt was outspoken, and she cited G.E.’s focus on clean energy, including Current, a subsidiary that focuses on products and services in energy efficiency, renewable generation and energy storage to large customers. “He’s pretty out there and clear,” he said. “That’s his position in every conversation he has.” A PepsiCo spokesman, Jay Cooney, said the company believes that “combating climate change is critical to the future of our company, customers, consumers and our world.” Kevin Gardner of Walmart, said its environmental commitments were “embedded in our business.” Thomas Hushen, spokesman for Campbell Soup, said the company supported “continued U.S. participation in the Paris agreement and the continuation of low-carbon policies and investment in a low-carbon economy.” Campbell’s chief executive, Denise Morrison, participates in Mr. Trump’s advisory council because “we believe it is important to have a voice on matters that will affect our industry, our company and our employees.” Mr. Hushen said. Corporations, especially those with strong consumer brands, have been increasingly responsive to customer and shareholder concerns about climate change. And the global nature of their businesses means many of their customers are in countries where there is a greater acceptance of the science behind climate change, and the need to tackle it. Walmart, Intel, General Motors and Lockheed Martin — all of which have senior executives on Mr. Trump’s business councils — have signed on to the principles of the Renewable Energy Buyers Alliance, a coalition of nonprofit groups working to make corporate purchases of renewable energy easier. Last year, General Motors said it would generate or procure 100 percent of its electricity from renewable sources by 2050. Dell, another company with the president’s ear, says it expects to reduce the energy intensity of its products by 80 percent by 2020. “In many cases, I think businesses disagree with the administration,” said Danielle Fugere, president of As You Sow, a nonprofit group that uses shareholder resolutions to advocate for greater corporate environmental and social responsibility. “People still care about climate change,” she said. “The administration may not, but they do have consumers and employees and reputations to uphold.” Some corporations’ positions on climate change are not as clear-cut as they may seem. Intel joined in a plea for the United States to honor its Paris commitments but was also among companies that submitted comments critical of the carbon pollution regulations in the Clean Power Plan. Environmentalists also worry about the influence of companies that have opposed climate regulations. General Motors and Ford, for example, successfully advocated a review of stringent federal regulations on vehicle pollution. And at least six companies with seats on Mr. Trump’s advisory boards — JPMorgan Chase, Walmart, Boeing, IBM, Dow Chemical and Lockheed Martin — also participate in the Business Roundtable, which in mid-February gave Mr. Trump a wish list of 16 rules it wanted killed, including the Clean Power Plan. (Walmart declined to address the discrepancy between that group’s demands and its climate commitments, and Intel did not respond to requests for comment.) Then there is the former ExxonMobil chief executive, Rex W. Tillerson, now secretary of state. Mr. Tillerson has publicly disparaged the Clean Power Plan, calling it “an unfortunate example of E.P.A. exceeding its authority” in a 2015 speech. But Exxon has also urged the Trump administration not to retreat from the Paris agreement and has supported a tax on carbon emissions. Businesses are pushing for policies to fight climate change “because of a well-balanced economic judgment of whether or not they should,” said Hervé Touati, a managing director at the Rocky Mountain Institute, an environmental research group. He added that sentiment among corporate executives had, after the 2009 global climate conference in Copenhagen, shifted away from the belief that fighting climate change would be too expensive. “In Paris, there was a very significant number of business leaders that had changed their minds and considered that it was going to hurt the economy if we don’t do something,” he said.

Edwards AFB: A place where 'we want innovators to innovate' BY JILL BARNES NELSON jbnelson@tehachapinews.com jbnelson Mar 30, 2017 Updated Mar 30, 2017 Jill Barnes Nelson / Tehachapi News John Esch, the director of Air Force Plant 42 in Palmdale, said the facility does a lot of testing there for the military. Jill Barnes Nelson / Tehachapi News Edwards Air Force Base is a place for innovation. This test dummy was configured to be able to change direction for a safe landing upon ejection from a plane. Jill Barnes Nelson / Tehachapi News Chris Klug, a senior civilian technical adviser to the 412th test wing, described how drones are being used at EAFB at a recent media roundtable. Jill Barnes Nelson / Tehachapi News Edwards AFB Brigadier General Carl Schaefer discusses what could happen if privately owned drones invaded the base's air space. jbnelson Tony Rubino, the range squadron director for the 412th Test Wing at EAFB, tells how innovation is key at the base. EDWARDS AFB — They do more than just test fighter planes. Many of the ideas for the future are hatched at the base and at Air Force Plant 42 in Palmdale, leaders of those operations shared at a recent media roundtable held here. “We have a lot of innovation here,” said Anthony “Tony” Rubino, who is the range squadron director for the 412th Test Wing at EAFB. “We're sort of like Silicon Valley where new ideas are formed and tested." Or, as he put it, the base can sometimes be like the television show “Shark Tank.” Rubino said there are 45 programs in the works, testing out ideas. “We have panels that investigate and accelerate moving forward on those ideas if we think it's necessary, like they do on 'Shark Tank.' We want innovators to innovate.” Rubino reported one “innovator,” Trever Bush, discovered a better way to recover test dummies ejected from a jet. “Trever devised a new steering system on the test dummy so when ejected, it could safely land without much damage,” Rubino said. “A $6,000 test dummy can now be recovered for just a cost of $1,600 with new equipment, and the cost should go down in the future.” In addition to new innovations, everyday problems also are being addressed. James Judkins, the base's head civil engineer, is working on getting a 350-megawatt solar plant at Edwards. There currently are three facilities of five megawatts each on site. “We're working with public and private partnerships to possibly sell back some of the electricity,” he said. Judkins also noted the base has conserved water like other areas around the region. “We cut down our water consumption by some 40 percent,” he said. “We want to be good neighbors and be as green as we can.” Chris Klug serves as a senior civilian technical adviser to the 412th Test Wing. He described how drones are used. “They're helping us perform our missions more efficiently,” he said. “We're exploring the technology. It could hold tremendous potential and could be used in weapons. Right now is a time of unprecedented change in testing those technologies.” Brigadier General Carl Schaefer of the 412th Test Wing was asked about possible encroachment of civilian drones on the base. “They are a concern as anyone can buy one,” he said. “They are not allowed to invade our airspace and we could detain that person if they do. However, right now we have nothing in place concerning the rules of engagement. We couldn't just shoot it down, but we're looking into the different issues concerning them.” Schaefer also reported the Air Force has a “very robust” cyber defense mechanism in place. “We're very well defended on the ground and on-board,” he said. “But we're always checking our 50 major weapon systems.” John Esch is the director of Air Force Plant 42, a 5,600-acre facility in Palmdale. It does a lot of testing for such things as the aircraft, security, communications and logistics. “We are a unique asset,” he said. “We have some 8,500 contract and government personnel working here. We also work with NASA. It's an exciting place to be.” Esch noted the Air Force has never actually built a plane; companies such as Boeing and Northrop-Grumman do, but his base does much of the testing on new aircraft. “We're always moving things along,” he said. “We try to make everything more efficient.” Like other military facilities, Esch said they are working on the infrastructure at Plant 42. “The original facility was built some 57 years ago and (there) is a need for a reinvestment in it,” he said. “We working on a budget plan and with the FAA to bring us into the next generation.” More information +4 Edwards AFB looks to the future EDWARDS AFB — If you use the GPS on your cell phone, you can thank the Air Force. jbnelson Follow jbnelson Close Get email notifications on jbnelson daily!
